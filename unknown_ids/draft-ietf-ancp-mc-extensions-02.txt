                 Multicast Control Extensions for ANCP
                  draft-ietf-ancp-mc-extensions-02.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies the extensions to the Access Node Control
   Protocol required for support of the multicast use cases defined in
   the Access Node Control Protocol framework document.  Those use cases
   are organized into the following ANCP capabilities:

   o  NAS-initiated multicast replication;

   o  conditional access with white and black lists;

   o  conditional access with grey lists;

   o  bandwidth delegation.

   These capabilities may be combined according to the rules given in
   this specification.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-ancp-framework] defines a framework and requirements for an
   Access Node control mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS)
   and an Access Node (e.g. a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer
   (DSLAM)) in a multi-service reference architecture in order to
   perform QoS-related, service-related and subscriber-related
   operations.  [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] specifies a protocol for Access
   Node Control in broadband networks in line with this framework.

   The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] supports a number of use cases defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ancp-framework] such as the Access Topology Discovery use
   case, the Access Loop Configuration use case and the Remote
   Connectivity Test use case.  However, it does not support the
   multicast use cases defined in [I-D.ietf-ancp-framework].  The
   present document specifies the extensions to the Access Node Control
   Protocol required for support of these multicast use cases.  In terms
   of the ANCP protocol, these use cases are organized into four
   capabilities:

   o  NAS-initiated multicast replication;

   o  conditional access with white and black lists;

   o  conditional access with grey lists;

   o  bandwidth delegation.

   NAS-initiated multicast replication assumes that multicast "join" and
   "leave" requests are terminated on the NAS, or that the NAS receives
   requests to establish multicast sessions through other means (e.g.,
   application-level signalling).  The NAS sends commands to the AN to
   start or stop replication of specific multicast flows on specific
   subscriber ports.  This use case is described briefly in the next-to-
   last paragraph of Section 3.4 of [I-D.ietf-ancp-framework].

   Conditional access is described in Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-ancp-framework], with the latter section particularly
   applicable to operation with white and black lists only.  In case of
   "conditional access with white and black lists", multicast join and
   leave requests are terminated at the AN and accepted or ignored in
   accordance with the direction provided by white and black lists
   respectively.  The white and black lists are provisioned per port at
   startup time and may be modified thereafter.  The NAS may enable
   admission control of white-listed flows by appropriate provisioning.

   Conditional access with grey lists is similar to conditional access

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   with white lists, except that before accepting any request matching a
   grey list entry, the AN sends a request to the NAS for permission to
   replicate the flow.  Again, the NAS can enable admission control of
   grey-listed flows at the AN.

   Bandwidth delegation is described in Section 3.4.2.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ancp-framework].  It allows flexible sharing of total video
   bandwidth on an access line between the AN and the NAS.  One
   application of such bandwidth sharing is where the AN does multicast
   admission control, while the NAS or Policy Server does unicast
   admission control.  In that case, bandwidth delegation allows dynamic
   sharing of bandwidth between unicast and multicast video traffic on
   each access line.

   The formal specification of the behaviours associated with each of
   these capabilities, singly and in combination, is given in Section 6.

   In addition to the multicast service processing behaviour just
   sketched, the definition of each capability includes support for the
   multicast accounting and reporting services described in Section
   3.4.3 of [I-D.ietf-ancp-framework].  Because of this common content
   and because of other protocol overlaps between the different
   capabilities, the protocol descriptions for the multicast extensions
   specified in this document are merged into a single non-redundant
   narrative.  Tables in Section 6 then indicate the specific sub-
   sections of the protocol description that have to be implemented to
   support each capability.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The expression "delegated bandwidth" is used as a shorter way of
   saying: "the total amount of video bandwidth delegated to the AN for
   multicast admission control".

3.  Multicast Use Cases

   Quoting from [I-D.ietf-ancp-framework]:

   "... the Access Node, aggregation node(s) and the NAS must all be
   involved in the multicast replication process.  This avoids that
   several copies of the same stream are sent within the access/
   aggregation network.  In case of an Ethernet-based access/aggregation
   network, this may, for example, be achieved by means of IGMP snooping
   or IGMP proxy in the Access Node and aggregation node(s).  By
   introducing IGMP processing in the access/aggregation nodes, the
   multicast replication process is now divided between the NAS, the
   aggregation node(s) and Access Nodes.  In order to ensure backward
   compatibility with the ATM-based model, the NAS, aggregation node and
   Access Node need to behave as a single logical device.  This logical
   device must have exactly the same functionality as the NAS in the ATM
   access/aggregation network.  The Access Node Control Mechanism can be
   used to make sure that this logical/functional equivalence is
   achieved by exchanging the necessary information between the Access
   Node and the NAS.  "

   [I-D.ietf-ancp-framework] describes the use cases for ANCP associated
   with such multicast operations, and identifies the associated ANCP
   requirements.  The present section describes a subset of these use
   cases as background to facilitate reading of this document, but the
   reader is refered to [I-D.ietf-ancp-framework] for a more exhaustive
   description of the ANCP multicast use cases.  Detailed example
   message flows can also be found in Appendix A.

3.1.  NAS Initiated Multicast Replication Control Use Case

3.1.1.  Goals

   One option for multicast handling is for the subscriber to
   communicate the "join/leave" information to the NAS.  This can be
   done for instance by terminating all subscriber IGMP ([RFC3376]) or
   MLD ([RFC2710], [RFC3810]) signaling on the NAS.  Another example
   could be a subscriber using some form of application level signaling,
   which is redirected to the NAS.  In any case, this option is
   transparent to the access and aggregation network.  In this scenario,
   the NAS uses ANCP to create and remove replication state in the AN
   for efficient multicast replication.  Thus, the NAS only sends a
   single copy of the multicast stream towards the AN, which in turn
   performs replication to multiple subscribers as instructed by the NAS
   via ANCP.  The NAS first performs conditional access and multicast
   admission control when processing multicast join requests, and only
   creates replication state in the AN if admission succeeds.

3.1.2.  Message Flow

   With the NAS-initiated use case, a Multicast Replication Control
   Message is sent by the NAS to the AN with a directive to either join
   or leave one (or more) multicast flow(s).  In the example message
   flow, the AN uses a Generic Response message to convey the outcome of
   the directive.  Figure 1 illustrates such an ANCP message exchange as
   well as the associated AN behavior.

3.2.  Conditional Access and Admission Control Use Case

3.2.1.  Goals

   One option for multicast handling is for the access/aggregation nodes
   to participate in IGMP/MLD processing (e.g. via IGMP/MLD snooping).
   In this scenario, on detecting a join/leave request from an enduser
   for a multicast flow (in the grey list), the AN uses ANCP to request
   conditional access and admission control decision from the NAS.  In
   turn, after conditional access and admission control checks, the NAS

   uses ANCP to instruct the AN to change the replication states
   accordingly.

3.2.2.  Message Flow

   For support of the conditional access and admission control use case,
   on detection of an IGMP/MLD Join, the AN sends an Admission Control
   message to the NAS to request conditional access and admission
   control check.  In case of positive outcome, the NAS sends a
   Multicast Replication Control Message to the AN with a directive to
   replicate the multicast flow to the corresponding user.  Similarly on
   detection of an IGMP/MLD leave, an Admission Control message is sent
   by the AN to the NAS to keep the NAS aware of user departure for the
   flow.  This message flow is illustrated in Figure 2.

3.3.  Multicast Flow Reporting Use Case

3.3.1.  Goals

   The Multicast flow reporting use case allows the NAS to
   asynchronously query the AN to obtain an instantaneous status report
   related to multicast flows currently replicated by the AN.

3.3.2.  Message Flow

   The NAS sends a Multicast Flow Query Request message to the AN in
   order to query the AN about information such as which multicast flows
   are currently active on a given AN port or which ports are currently
   replicating a given multicast flow.  The AN conveys the requested
   information to the NAS in a Multicast Flow Query Response message.
   This message flow is illustrated in Figure 3.

4.  ANCP Messages

   This section defines new ANCP messages and new usage of existing ANCP
   messages as well as procedures associated with the use of these
   messages.

4.1.  Provisioning Message

   Section 5.4.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] defines the Provisioning
   message that is sent by the NAS to the AN to provision information in
   the AN.

   The present document specifies that the Provisioning message MAY be
   used by the NAS to provision multicast-related information (e.g.
   multicast service profiles).  The ANCP Provisioning message payload
   MAY contain:

   o  one or more instances of the Multicast-Service-Profile TLV.  The
      Multicast-Service-Profile TLV is defined in the present document
      in Section 5.1.  Each instance of the Multicast-Service-Profile
      TLV contains a multicast service profile name and one or more list
      actions.  A list action consists of an action (add, delete,
      replace), a list type (White, Black, or Grey), and list content
      (multicast source and group addresses).

   o  an instance of the White-List-CAC TLV.  The White-List-CAC TLV is
      defined in Section 5.6.  If present, this TLV indicates that the
      AN is required to do admission control before replicating White-
      listed flows.

   o  an instance of the MRepCtl-CAC TLV.  The MRepCtl-CAC TLV is
      defined in Section 5.7.  If present, this TLV indicates that the
      AN is required to do admission control before replicating flows
      specified in Multicast Replication Control messages.

   See Section 6 for information on which multicast capabilities require
   support of these TLVs in the Provisioning message.

4.1.1.  Sender Behaviour

   When directed by the Policy Server or by management action, the NAS
   sends the Provisioning message to initially provision or to update
   the White, Black, and/or Grey multicast channel lists associated with
   a set of named multicast service profiles, or to enable the AN to
   perform admission control for specific classes of flows.

   To provision or update a multicast service profile, the NAS MUST
   include within the message one or more instances of the Multicast-



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   Service-Profile TLV specifying the content to be provisioned or
   updated.  The NAS SHOULD NOT include any list type (White, Black, or
   Grey) that is not supported by the set of multicast capabilities
   negotiated between the NAS and the AN.  The NAS MUST NOT use the
   Provisioning message to send instances of the Multicast-Service-
   Profile TLV to the AN unless the Multicast-Service-Profile TLV is
   supported by the set of multicast capabilities negotiated between the
   NAS and the AN.

   To require admission control to be performed at the AN on White-
   listed flows, the NAS MUST include a copy of the White-List-CAC TLV
   in the Provisioning message.  The White-List-CAC TLV MUST NOT be
   provided unless the negotiated set of capabilities includes
   conditional access with White and Black lists.

   To require admission control to be performed at the AN on Grey-listed
   flows or on NAS-initiated flows, the NAS MUST include a copy of the
   MRepCtl-CAC TLV in the Provisioning message.  The MRepCtl-CAC TLV
   MUST NOT be provided unless the negotiated set of capabilities
   includes NAS-initiated replication control or conditional access with
   Grey lists.

4.1.2.  Receiver Behaviour

   The receiving AN provisions/updates the White, Black, and/or Grey
   lists associated with the multicast service profile names contained
   in the Multicast-Service-Profile TLV instances within the message
   according to the contents of the associated List-Action TLVs.  The AN
   MUST process List-Action TLVs in the order in which they appear
   within the message.  The AN MUST ignore instances of the List-Action
   TLV referring to any list type (White, Black, or Grey) that is not
   supported by the set of multicast capabilities negotiated between the
   NAS and the AN.

   When a new multicast service profile is identified by a Multicast-
   Service-Profile TLV, the initial state of all lists associated with
   that profile according to the negotiated set of multicast
   capabilities is empty until changed by the contents of Multicast-
   Service-Profile TLVs.

   The receipt of a Provisioning message containing updates to an
   existing multicast service profile subsequent to startup will cause
   the AN to review the status of active flows on all ports to which
   that profile has been assigned.  For further details, see Section 6.

   If the White-List-CAC and/or MRepCtl-CAC TLV is present in the
   Provisioning message and the respective associated capabilities have
   been negotiated, the AN prepares (or continues) to do connection



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   admission control on the indicated class(es) of flow.  If one or both
   of these TLVs was present in an earlier Provisioning message but is
   absent in the latest message received, the AN ceases to do connection
   admission control on the indicated class(es) of flow.

   As indicated in [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol], the AN MUST NOT reply to
   the Provisioning message if it processed it successfully.  If an
   error prevents successful processing of the message content, the AN
   MUST return a Generic Response message as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol], containing a Status-Info TLV with the
   appropriate content describing the error.  For this purpose, the
   presence of a list type in a Multicast-Service-Profile TLV which was
   ignored because it was not supported by the negotiated set of
   capabilities is not considered to be an error.

      Editor's note: that means that if a NAS mistakenly adds the wrong
      list types there will be no debugging feedback.  On the other
      hand, this adds flexibility for handling pre-assembled sets of
      list updates being sent out to multiple ANs.  If there are no
      comments on this feature/bug, this Editor's note will be removed
      in the next version of the draft.

4.2.  Port Management Message

   As specified in [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol], the NAS may send line
   configuration information to the AN ("ANCP based Line Configuration"
   use case) using GSMP Port Management messages modified to contain an
   extension block.  Section 5.4.3 of [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] defines a
   number of TLVs that can be included in the Extension Value field
   inside a Port Management message to support line configuration.

   This document specifies that the Port Management message MAY also
   include either or both of the following TLVs:

   o  Multicast-Service-Profile-Name TLV (defined in Section 5.2).  This
      TLV associates a Multicast Service Profile with the Access Port
      specified by the extension block.

   o  Bandwidth-Allocation TLV (defined in Section 5.5).  This TLV
      specifies the total multicast bandwidth available to the AN for
      admission control at the Access Port.

4.2.1.  Sender Behaviour

   The NAS sends the Port Management message at startup time to
   initialize parameters associated with the Access Port specified in
   the message and with the multicast capabilities negotiated between
   the NAS and the AN.  The NAS MAY send additional Port Management



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   messages subsequent to startup, to update or, in the case of the
   Bandwidth-Allocation TLV, reset these parameters.  If the NAS
   includes a Multicast-Service-Profile-Name TLV in the Port Management
   message, the name MUST match a profile name provided in a Multicast-
   Service-Profile TLV in a prior Provisioning message.  The NAS MUST
   NOT include a TLV unless it is supported by the set of multicast
   capabilities negotiated between the NAS and the AN.  See Section 6
   for further information.

4.2.2.  Receiver Behaviour

   If the Port Management message contains a Multicast-Service-Profile-
   Name TLV, the AN associates the named profile with the specified
   Access Port.  This association replaces any previous association.
   That is, a given Access Port is associated with at most one multicast
   service profile.  The replacement of one multicast service profile
   with another will cause the AN to review the status of all active
   flows on the target port.  For further details see Section 6.

   If the Port Management message contains a Bandwidth-Allocation TLV,
   the AN adopts this as the current value of its total multicast
   bandwidth limit for the target port.  If the AN has already committed
   multicast bandwidth exceeding the amount given in the Bandwidth-
   Allocation TLV, the AN SHOULD NOT discontinue any multicast streams
   in order to bring bandwidth down to within the new limit.  However,
   the AN MUST NOT admit new multicast streams that are subject to
   admission control until it can do so within the limit specified by
   the Bandwidth-Allocation TLV.

   If the Port Management request cannot be processed due to error and
   the Result field of the request is Nack (0x1) or AckAll (0x2), the AN
   SHOULD add a Status-Info TLV to the Extension Value field in its
   reply if this will provide useful information beyond what is provided
   by the Code value returned in the response header.  In particular, if
   the name within the Multicast-Service-Profile-Name TLV does not match
   a profile name given in a prior Provisioning message, the AN SHOULD
   return a reply where the Code field in the header indicates "Invalid
   TLV value" (85), the Error Message field in the Status-Info TLV
   contains the text "Multicast profile name not provisioned", and the
   Status-Info TLV contains a copy of the Multicast-Service-Profile-Name
   TLV.

4.3.  Multicast Replication Control Message

   This section defines a new message called the Multicast Replication
   Control message.  The Multicast Replication Control message is sent
   by the NAS to the AN with one or more directives to add (join) or
   delete (leave) a multicast flow on a target object identified in the

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   content of the message.

   The Message Type for the Multicast Replication Control message is
   144.

   The ANCP Multicast Replication Control message payload contains the
   following TLVs:

   o  Target TLV: The Target TLV is defined in [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol].
      It MUST appear once and only once.  It is encoded as specified in
      [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] and identifies the AN port subject to the
      request for admission or release.

   o  Command TLV: The Command TLV is defined in
      [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol].  It MUST be present.  It MAY appear
      multiple times.

   As [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] indicates, the contents of the Command
   Info field within the Command TLV are specific to the message in
   which the TLV occurs.  For the Multicast Replication Control Message,
   these contents consist of:

   o  a Command Code field;

   o  an Accounting field;

   o  an instance of the Multicast-Flow TLV.

   Figure 4 illustrates the complete Command TLV with the contents
   specific to the Multicast Replication Control message.

                       0x06 - Admission Control and Conditional Access
                       Reject.

             Directives 0x04 through 0x06 are used as described in
             Section 4.4.2

   Accounting:
             Meaningful only when the Command Code is "Add" (0x01).  In
             that case, 0x00 indicates no flow accounting, 0x01
             indicates that octet accounting for the flow is to
             commence.  The Accounting field MUST be set to 0x00 for
             other Command Code values.

             sender and ignored by the receiver.

   Multicast-Flow TLV:
             An instance of the Multicast-Flow TLV (Section 5.11)
             specifying the flow to be added or deleted.  The Multicast-
             Flow TLV MUST be omitted if the Command Code has value
             "Delete All" (0x03).

   Other embedded TLV:
             No other embedded TLVs are currently specified within the
             Multicast Replication Control message/Command TLV.
             Unrecognized embedded TLVs SHOULD be silently discarded.

4.3.1.  Sender Behaviour

   The NAS MAY issue a Multicast Replication Control message to the AN
   to convey one or more directives to add (join) or delete (leave) one
   or more multicast flows.

   The NAS MAY send this message on its own initiative to support the
   NAS initiated Multicast Control use case presented in
   [I-D.ietf-ancp-framework] and summarized in Section 3.1.  In that
   case, the NAS MUST set the Result field to AckAll (0x2) or Nack (0x1)
   according to its requirements.

   The NAS MAY also send this message in response to a Multicast
   Admission Control message (defined in Section 4.4) received from the
   AN to support the conditional access and admission control use case
   presented in [I-D.ietf-ancp-framework] and summarized in Section 3.2.
   In that case, the NAS MUST set the Result field to NAck (0x1).

   In either case, the sender MUST populate the Code field with the
   value 0x000 and the ANCP Transaction Identifier field with a unique
   value, as described in section 5.4.5 of [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol].

   Each Multicast Replication Control Message MUST contain one or more
   commands, each encapsulated in its own Command TLV.  The sender MUST
   use a separate Command TLV for each distinct multicast flow.

   When the order of processing of two commands does not matter, the
   commands MUST be transmitted in separate Multicast Replication
   Control messages.

4.3.2.  Receiver Behaviour

   When successive commands (in the same or different messages) relate
   to the same Target and multicast flow, the state of each feature
   controlled or affected by attributes received in the Multicast
   Replication Control message, SHALL be as set by the last command or
   message referring to that target and flow and containing the
   controlling attribute.  As an example, successive Multicast
   Replication Control messages containing add commands for a given port
   and flow, but differing only in the Accounting field setting SHALL be
   interpreted to mean that the state of the accounting feature is as
   set in the final command received, but all other features are as set
   in the initial message.

   If more than one Command TLV is present in a Multicast Replication
   Control message, the AN MUST act on the commands in the order in
   which they are presented in the message.  The AN SHALL assign a
   sequence number to each command in a given Multicast Replication



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 21]

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   Control message, starting from 0x01 for the first command.

   If a Command TLV adds a flow and the AN is performing admission
   control for Multicast Replication Control messages, then the AN MUST
   perform admission control before replicating the flow.  If the
   admission control check fails, the AN MUST treat the failure as an
   error as described below.  The appropriate Code value for the
   response is 18 (0x012) "Insufficient resources".

   If the AN processes the complete Multicast Replication Control
   message successfully and the Result field of the Multicast
   Replication Control message was set to AckAll (0x2), the AN MUST
   respond with a Generic Response message where the Result field is set
   to Success (0x3), the Code field is set to 0x000, and the Transaction
   Identifier field is copied from the Multicast Replication Control
   message.  The body of the response MAY be empty or MAY be copied from
   the Multicast Replication Control message.

   If the AN processes the complete Multicast Replication Control
   message successfully and the Result field of the Multicast
   Replication Control message was set to Nack (0x1), the AN MUST NOT
   respond to the message.

   The processing/execution of multiple commands contained in a single
   Multicast Control message MUST be interrupted at the first error
   encountered, and the remaining commands in the Multicast Replication
   Control message discarded.

   If the AN detects an error in a received Multicast Replication
   Control message and the Result field in that message was set to Nack
   (0x1) or AckAll(0x2), the AN MUST generate a Generic Response message
   providing error information to the NAS.  This specification
   identifies the following new Code values beyond those specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol], which MAY be used in a Generic Response
   sent in reply to a Multicast Replication Control message:

   100  Command error.  This SHOULD be reported for the case that an
      invalid command code has been received.

   101  Bad flow address.  This SHOULD be reported for the following
      cases:

      *  unsupported address family;

      *  source address present for an ASM flow, or absent for an SSM
         flow.

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   102  Multicast flow does not exist.  This SHOULD be reported if the
      NAS attempts to delete a flow that is not enabled.

   A Generic Response message responding to the Multicast Replication
   Control message and containing one of the above Code values MUST
   include a Status-Info TLV which includes one or two embedded TLVs as
   follows:

   o  a Sequence-Number TLV as described in Section 5.4, giving the
      sequence number of the failed command, MUST be included;

   o  the failed Command TLV itself SHOULD be included.

      Note that the Error Message field of the Status-Info TLV MAY be
      used to report more details than implied by the Code value in the
      message header.  For example, the Code value could be 101 and the
      Error Message field could contain the text: "Source address
      present for ASM flow".

4.4.  Multicast Admission Control Message

   This section defines a new message called the Multicast Admission
   Control message.  The Multicast Admission Control message is sent by
   the AN to the NAS to request admission of a multicast flow, or to
   notify of the removal of a multicast flow, for a given target.

   The Message Type for the Multicast Admission Control message is 145.

   The ANCP Multicast Admission Control message payload contains two
   TLVs:

   o  Target TLV: The Target TLV is defined in [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol].
      It MUST appear once and only once in the Multicast Admission
      Control message.  It is encoded as specified in
      [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] and identifies the AN port subject to the
      request for admission or release.

   o  Command TLV: The Command TLV is defined in
      [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol].  It MUST be present.  If it appears more
      than once, only the first instance is considered meaningful in the
      present version of this specification and the other instances are
      ignored.

   Informative note:

      In the future, the specification of the Admission Control message
      may be extended to allow transport of more than a single directive
      (e.g. to carry both a leave from one group and a join to another



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 23]

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


      group for the same Target).  It is expected that this would
      support a similar notion of strict sequenced processing as
      currently defined for handling multiple directives in the
      Multicast Replication Control message whereby all directives
      following the first directive that can not be executed are not
      executed either.  When the strict sequenced processing of the
      directives is not required the directives are distributed across
      separate messages.

   The Command TLV has the same contents as were described above for the
   Multicast Replication Control message, with the following additions:

   o  a Request-Source-IP TLV MAY be appended to the Command TLV as an
      additional embedded TLV;

   o  similarly, a Request-Source-MAC TLV MAY be appended to the Command
      TLV as an additional embedded TLV.

   Note that the Command TLV length includes the length of any embedded
   TLVs, including the embedded TLV headers.

4.4.1.  Sender Behaviour

   The AN sending the Multicast Admission Control message MUST set the
   Result field to Ignore (0x0).

   The AN MUST populate the ANCP Transaction Identifier field with a
   unique value, as described in section 5.4.5
   of[I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] .

   The AN MUST encode the Command TLV as specified in Section 4.3 with
   the following additional rules:

   o  the Accounting field MUST be set to 0;

   o  the Command Code field MUST be set to "0x01 - Add" when the
      message conveys a Join , to "0x02 - Delete" when the message
      conveys a Leave and to "0x03 - Delete All" when the message
      conveys a Leave of all channels (on the target);

   o  The Multicast-Flow TLV within the Command TLV identifies the
      multicast flow subject to the request for admission or release.
      When the Command Code is 0x03, the Multicast-Flow TLV is
      meaningless and MUST be omitted.

   o  the Request-Source-IP embedded TLV MAY be included by the AN to
      convey the IP address of the sender of the join/leave message
      (e.g.  IGMP/MLD Join/Leave) that triggered the AN to include the

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


      corresponding Command TLV in the Admission Control message.  If it
      appears more than once, only the first instance is considered
      meaningful and the other instances are ignored.

   o  the Request-Source-MAC embedded TLV MAY be included by the AN to
      convey the MAC address of the sender of the join/leave message
      (e.g.  IGMP/MLD Join/Leave) that triggered the AN to include the
      corresponding Command TLV in the Admission Control message.  If it
      appears more than once, only the first instance is considered
      meaningful and the other instances are ignored.

4.4.2.  Receiver Behaviour

   On receipt of an Multicast Admission Control message, the NAS:

   o  MUST ignore the Result field;

   o  if the directive in the Multicast Admission Control message is
      "0x02 - Delete" or "0x03 - Delete All" and is processed correctly
      by the NAS, the NAS MUST NOT generate any ANCP message in response
      to the Multicast Admission Control message;

   o  if the directive in the Multicast Admission Control message is
      "0x01 - Add" and is accepted by the NAS, the NAS MUST generate a
      Multicast Replication Control in response to the Multicast
      Admission Control message.  The Multicast Replication Control
      message:

      *  MUST contain a Result set to Nack (0x1);

      *  MUST contain a Transaction ID generated by the NAS (distinct
         non-zero, and linearly incremented by NAS for each request per
         adjacency);

      *  MUST contain the directive as accepted by the NAS.  The NAS MAY
         modify the Accounting field if flow accounting is required.

   o  if the directive in the Multicast Admission Control message is
      "0x01 - Add", is processed correctly but not accepted by the NAS
      (i.e. it does not pass the admission control or conditional access
      check), the NAS MAY generate a Multicast Replication Control
      message in response to the Multicast Admission Control message.
      This optional message can be used by the AN to maintain statistics
      about admission control rejections.

         In the future, the AN may be able to notify the subscriber that
         the request was rejected (e.g. using
         [I-D.morin-mboned-igmpmld-error-feedback]).



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 25]

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


      When used in this situation, the Multicast Replication Control
      message:

      *  MUST contain a Result set to 0x0;

      *  MUST contain a Transaction ID generated by the NAS (distinct
         non-zero, and linearly incremented by NAS for each request per
         adjacency);

      *  MUST contain the directive rejected by the NAS (i.e.  Target
         TLV and Command TLV) but with a Command Code set to "0x04 -
         Admission Control Reject", "0x05 - Conditional Access Reject",
         or "0x06 - Admission Control and Conditional Access Reject".

   o  if the Multicast Admission Control message cannot be processed
      correctly by the NAS (e.g. the message is malformed, the multicast
      flow does not exist etc.), the NAS MUST generate a Generic
      Response message (defined in [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol]) with
      appropriate content indicating the reason for the failure.

4.5.  Bandwidth Reallocation Request Message

   The Bandwidth Reallocation Request message is used when the bandwidth
   delegation capability is included in the negotiated set.  It MAY be
   sent either by the NAS or by the AN to request an adjustment in the
   amount of delegated bandwidth.  It will be sent by the NAS typically
   to reduce the multicast bandwidth allocated to the AN in order for
   the NAS to satisfy a request to add one or more flows.  Conversely,
   the AN will send a Bandwidth Reallocation Request to obtain
   additional bandwidth to satisfy a request to add a multicast channel.
   In each case, the requestor has a minimum requirement for additional
   bandwidth, and MAY ask for additional bandwidth beyond this amount
   (e.g., to handle anticipated future requests).

   The Bandwidth Reallocation Request message contains two TLVs:

   o  the Target TLV (section 5.4.5.1.1 of [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol]),
      specifying a single access line;

   o  the Bandwidth-Request TLV (Section 5.8), specifying the required
      and preferred amounts of delegated bandwidth.

   The Message Type for the Bandwidth Reallocation Request message is
   146.

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


4.5.1.  Sender Behaviour

   The Result field in the header of the Bandwidth Reallocation Request
   message is not used and the sender MUST set it to Ignore (0x0).

   The bandwidth values in the Bandwidth-Request TLV are expressed in
   terms of total multicast bandwidth allocated to the AN.

      The choice of "total bandwidth" rather than "incremental
      bandwidth" was made so that it would be easier for the AN and NAS
      to keep their respective views of the current amount of delegated
      bandwidth synchronized.

   Because the values are totals rather than desired increments/
   decrements, the relationship between the required amount and the
   preferred amount will differ depending on whether the Bandwidth
   Reallocation Request message is issued by the NAS or the AN.

   o  If the NAS is making the request, the preferred amount MUST be
      less than or equal to the required amount.  The required amount
      MUST be less than the currently amount of delegated bandwidth.

   o  If the AN is making the request, the preferred amount MUST be
      greater than or equal to the required amount.  The required amount
      MUST be greater than the currently amount of delegated bandwidth.

4.5.2.  Receiver Behaviour

   When the peer receives a valid Bandwidth Reallocation Request
   message, it SHOULD determine whether it can satisfy the request from
   its existing allocation of unused video bandwidth.  If it decides
   that it can reallocate bandwidth to the peer, it MAY choose to return
   any amount between the required and the preferred amounts indicated
   in the Bandwidth Reallocation Request message.

   The peer MUST return a Bandwidth Transfer message Section 4.6
   indicating its decision.  If the request is met, the Result field of
   the Bandwidth Transfer message MUST be set to Success (0x3), the Code
   field MUST be set to 0x000, and the Bandwidth-Allocation TLV
   (Section 5.5) MUST contain the new value of total multicast
   bandwidth.  This new value MUST lie between the required and
   preferred values, inclusive, from the request message.  If the
   request is not met, the Result field of the Bandwidth Transfer
   message MUST be set to Failure (0x4), the Code field MUST be set to
   0x000, and the Bandwidth Allocation TLV MUST contain the value of the
   currently allocated amount of delegated bandwidth as the responder
   views it.

   The following cases indicate that the sender holds a different view
   of the amount of delegated bandwidth from the receiver:

   o  the NAS receives a request where the required amount is less than
      its view of the current amount of delegated bandwidth;

   o  the AN receives a request where the required amount is greater
      than its view of the current amount of delegated bandwidth.

   If one of these cases occurs, the receiver with one exception MUST
   send a Bandwidth Transfer message indicating Success.

   o  If the NAS received the request, the allocated amount in the NAS's
      response MUST be at least equal to NAS's view of the current
      amount of delegated bandwidth.

   o  If the AN received the request, the allocated amount in the AN's
      response MUST be no greater than the AN's view of the current
      amount of delegated bandwidth.

   The exception is when the NAS receives a request while it has a
   request of its own outstanding.  Handling of that case is described
   below.

      While the cases just described are an error condition, the success
      response achieves a graceful recovery.

   To avoid deadlock due to race conditions, the following rules MUST be
   applied:

   a.  If the NAS receives a Bandwidth Reallocation Request message
       while it has a Bandwidth Reallocation Request message of its own
       outstanding for the same access line, the NAS MUST provide an
       immediate failure response to the request from the AN, with a
       Code value set to 105 "Bandwidth request conflict".

   b.  If the AN receives a Bandwidth Reallocation Request message while
       it has a Bandwidth Reallocation Request message of its own
       outstanding for the same access line, the AN MUST release any
       bandwidth it has already committed to an outstanding Join request
       while it is awaiting a response from the NAS.  It MUST decide
       upon and send its response to the NAS taking the released
       bandwidth into account.

   If the receiver is unable to process the Bandwidth Reallocation
   Request message due to an error, then the receiver MUST return a
   Bandwidth Transfer message where:

   o  the Result field is set to Failure (0x4),

   o  the Code field is set appropriately to indicate the type of error
      that was detected,

   o  the Bandwidth Allocation TLV contains the value of the current
      amount of delegated bandwidth as the responder views it, and

   o  a Status-Info TLV MAY follow the Bandwidth Allocation TLV giving
      further information about the error.

   This specification provides three new Code values applicable
   specifically to the contents of the Bandwidth-Request TLV.  These
   Code values by their nature MUST only be used when the error is being
   reported in a Bandwidth Transfer message rather than a Generic
   Response message.

   103  invalid preferred bandwidth amount.  This indicates that the
      preferred and required amounts of bandwidth in the TLV do not have
      the numerical relationship described in the previous section.

   104  inconsistent views of delegated bandwidth amount.  This will
      appear only in a Bandwidth Transfer message from the NAS to the AN
      in the case where the NAS has an outstanding Bandwidth
      Reallocation Request.  The recommended procedure for recovery is
      described in Section 4.6.2.

   105  bandwidth request conflict.  The NAS has rejected the AN's
      request for more bandwidth because the NAS has an outstanding
      bandwidth request.

4.6.  Bandwidth Transfer Message

   The Bandwidth Transfer message is used to transfer video bandwidth
   from the sender to the peer for a specific access line.  This message
   MAY be sent either from the AN or from the NAS.  As described in the
   previous section, it is the required response to a valid Bandwidth
   Reallocation Request message.

   The Bandwidth Transfer message MAY also be used to transfer bandwidth
   autonomously from one peer to another.  One example of this usage is
   to release bandwidth borrowed earlier by means of the Bandwidth
   Reallocation Request message.  When the message is used in this way,
   the Result field in the Bandwidth Transfer message MUST be set to
   Ignore (0x0).

      This allows the receiver to distinguish between an autonomous
      transfer and a response to a previous Bandwidth Reallocation

      Request, for purposes of validation.

   The Message Type for the Bandwidth Transfer message is 147.  The
   Bandwidth Transfer message contains the following TLVs:

   o  the Target TLV, designating the access line concerned;

   o  an instance of the Bandwidth-Allocation TLV (Section 5.5).  The
      bandwidth value in the Bandwidth-Allocation TLV is the new amount
      of delegated bandwidth allocated to the target.

4.6.1.  Sender Behaviour

   When sending a Bandwidth Transfer message where the Result value is
   Ignore (0x0) or Success (0x3), the following relationships MUST hold:

   o  if the message is sent by the NAS, the bandwidth value in the
      Bandwidth-Allocation TLV MUST be greater than or equal to the
      sender's view of the current amount of delegated bandwidth for the
      access line concerned;

   o  if the message is sent by the AN, the bandwidth value in the
      Bandwidth-Allocation TLV MUST be less than or equal to the
      sender's view of the current amount of delegated bandwidth for the
      access line concerned.

   Further sender behaviour is specified above, in Section 4.5.2.

4.6.2.  Receiver Behaviour

4.6.2.1.  Behaviour of the NAS

   If the amount of delegated bandwidth provided in the Bandwidth-
   Allocation TLV is not greater than the NAS's view of the current
   amount of delegated bandwidth, the NAS MUST update its view of the
   current amount of delegated bandwidth to the amount indicated in the
   Bandwidth Transfer message.  This is required regardless of whether
   the Result field of that message indicates Success or Failure.

   If the amount of delegated bandwidth provided in the Bandwidth-
   Allocation TLV is greater than the NAS's view of the current amount
   of delegated bandwidth, the NAS MAY accept the given value as its new
   value of delegated bandwidth.  Alternatively, the NAS MAY force the
   AN to modify its view of the amount of delegated bandwidth to that
   held by the NAS, by sending a Port Management message for the target
   access line concerned, containing a Bandwidth-Allocation TLV with a
   value equal to the amount of delegated bandwidth the NAS wishes to
   enforce.

4.6.2.2.  Behaviour of the AN

   If the amount of delegated bandwidth provided in the Bandwidth-
   Allocation TLV of the Bandwidth Transfer message differs from the
   AN's view of the current amount of delegated bandwidth, the AN MUST
   update its view of the current amount of delegated bandwidth to the
   amount indicated in the Bandwidth Transfer message.  This is required
   with the exception of a Bandwidth Transfer message with a Result
   field equal to Failure (0x4) and a Code field equal to 104
   "Inconsistent views of delegated bandwidth amount" or 105 "Bandwidth
   request conflict".  If Code value 104 is received, the AN MUST issue
   a Delegated Bandwidth Query Request message to determine the NAS's
   current view of the amount of delegated bandwidth.  The AN MUST
   update its own view based on the value returned in the Delegated
   Bandwidth Query Response.  If Code value 105 is received, the AN
   SHOULD carry out this procedure unless it can account for the
   discrepancy as a result of a transfer of bandwidth to the NAS that
   was carried out just before the incoming Bandwidth Transfer message
   was processed.

      The two Code values indicate a race condition where the AN may
      have just completed a transfer of bandwidth to the NAS.  As a
      result, the value given in the Bandwidth Transfer message may be
      outdated, and the AN needs to query the NAS to find its latest
      view.  The procedure assumes that ordering is preserved between
      the Bandwidth Transfer message sent by the AN in response to the
      NAS's request and the subsequent Delegated Bandwidth Query Request
      message.

   If as the result of the procedures just described the AN determines
   that it has over-committed multicast bandwidth, it MUST NOT terminate
   any currently-active programs, but MUST NOT honour any more "join"
   requests until it is possible to do so within the limit set by its
   current value of delegated bandwidth.

4.7.  Delegated Bandwidth Query Request Message

   The Message Type for the Delegated Bandwidth Query Request (and
   Response) messages is 148.

   The Delegated Bandwidth Query Request message MAY be sent either by
   the NAS or by the AN to retrieve the peer's view of the amount of
   delegated bandwidth.  The request contains one TLV:

   o  a Target TLV designating the access line for which the information
      is requested.

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


4.7.1.  Sender Behaviour

   The sender MUST set the Result field in the header of the Delegated
   Bandwidth Query Request message to AckAll (0x2).  The Code value MUST
   be set to 0x000.  The sender MUST populate the ANCP Transaction
   Identifier field with a unique value, as described in section 5.4.5
   of [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol].

4.7.2.  Receiver Behaviour

   If the AN or NAS receives a valid Delegated Bandwidth Query Request
   message, it MUST respond with a Delegated Bandwidth Query Response
   message.  The Result field in the header of the response MUST be set
   to Success (0x3).  The Code field MUST be set to 0x000.  The
   Transaction-Id field MUST be copied from the request message.  The
   body of the response MUST contain the Target TLV, copied from the
   request message.  Finally, the body of the response MUST contain a
   Bandwidth-Allocation TLV, containing the current amount of delegated
   bandwidth from the point of view of the receiver of the request.

   If the contents of the Delegated Bandwidth Query Request message are
   in error, the receiver MUST return a Delegated Bandwidth Query
   Response message with the Result field in the header set to Failure
   (0x3).  The Code field MUST be set to the value that indicates the
   nature of the error (e.g., 4 "Unrecognized target").  The
   Transaction-Id field MUST be copied from the request.  The body of
   the response MUST contain the Target TLV copied from the request.
   This MAY be followed by a Status-Info TLV giving further information
   about the error.

4.8.  Delegated Bandwidth Query Response Message

   The Delegated Bandwidth Query Response message is sent in reply to a
   Delegated Bandwidth Query Request.  The response to a valid request
   contains two TLVs:

   o  the Target TLV, copied from the request;

   o  a Bandwidth-Allocation TLV, giving the responder's view of the
      current amount of multicast bandwidth delegated to the AN.

   The Message Type for the Delegated Bandwidth Query Response message
   is 148.

4.8.1.  Sender Behaviour

   Sender behaviour for the Delegated Bandwidth Query Response message
   is specified in Section 4.7.2.

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


4.8.2.  Receiver Behaviour

   If the Delegated Bandwidth Query Response message indicates Success
   (0x3), the following actions apply.

4.8.2.1.  Behaviour at the NAS

   If the amount of delegated bandwidth provided in the Bandwidth-
   Allocation TLV is less than the NAS's view of the current amount of
   delegated bandwidth, the NAS MUST update its view of the current
   amount of delegated bandwidth to the amount indicated in the
   Delegated Bandwidth Query Response message.

   If the amount of delegated bandwidth provided in the Bandwidth-
   Allocation TLV is greater than the NAS's view of the current amount
   of delegated bandwidth, the NAS MAY accept the given value as its new
   value of delegated bandwidth.  Alternatively, the NAS MAY force the
   AN to modify its view of the amount of delegated bandwidth to that
   held by the NAS, by sending a Port Management message for the target
   access line concerned, containing a Bandwidth-Allocation TLV with a
   value equal to the amount of delegated bandwidth the NAS wishes to
   enforce.

4.8.2.2.  Behaviour at the AN

   The AN SHOULD accept the value returned in the Bandwidth-Allocation
   TLV of the Delegated Bandwidth Query Response message as the correct
   value of the current amount of delegated bandwidth.  If the AN has
   currently committed more than this amount to active programs, it MUST
   NOT cease replicating the flows concerned, but MUST NOT honour any
   more Join requests until possible to do so within the new limit.

      A race condition is possible, where the AN sends a query, the NAS
      requests more bandwidth, then receives and responds to the query,
      then receives the Bandwidth Transfer message responding to its
      request.  It is up to the AN to take appropriate action in this
      case.  The best action appears to be not to act on the result of
      the first query, but to repeat the query after sending the
      Bandwidth Transfer message.  Similar considerations apply to a
      race between queries from both sides.

4.9.  Multicast Flow Query Request and Response Messages

   This section defines two new messages called the Multicast Flow Query
   Request and Multicast Flow Query Response.  The Multicast Flow Query
   Request is sent by the NAS to request information about the multicast
   flows that are active on the AN.  The Multicast Flow Query Response
   is sent in response by the AN to provide the requested information to

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   the NAS.

   The Message Type for the Multicast Flow Query Request and Multicast
   Flow Query Response messages is 149.

   The contents of the Multicast Flow Query Request and Response depend
   on the nature of the query, as described below.

4.9.1.  Sender Behaviour

   The sender of a Multicast Flow Query Request message MUST set the
   Result field to AckAll (0x2).  The Code field MUST be set to 0x000.
   The sender MUST populate the ANCP Transaction Identifier field with a
   unique value, as described in section 5.4.5 of [I-D.ietf-ancp-
   protocol].

   The Multicast Flow Query Request MAY be used by the NAS to retrieve:

   o  the AN's view of which multicast flows are currently active on a
      specified set of access ports; or

   o  the AN's view of the access ports on which a specified set of
      multicast flows are currently active; or

   o  the AN's view of all the multicast flows currently active on each
      and every port of the AN.

   To retrieve the AN's view of which multicast flows are currently
   active on a given port of the AN, the NAS MUST include a Target TLV
   in the Multicast Flow Query Request payload identifying that port.
   The Target TLV is encoded as specified in [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol].

   To retrieve the AN's view of the ports currently receiving a given
   multicast flow, the NAS MUST include a Multicast-Flow TLV in the
   Multicast Flow Query Request payload identifying that flow.  The
   Multicast-Flow TLV is encoded as specified in Section 5.11.

   The NAS MAY include multiple Target TLVs or multiple Multicast-Flow
   TLVs in the Multicast Flow Query Request, but MUST NOT include both
   Target and Multicast-Flow TLVs in the same message.

   To retrieve the AN's view of all of the multicast flows currently
   active on each port of the AN, the NAS MUST send a Multicast Flow
   Query Request which does not contain any instance of the Target TLV
   or the Multicast-Flow TLV.

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


4.9.2.  Receiver Behaviour

   The AN MUST respond to a Multicast Flow Query Request message that
   has a valid format and a valid content with a Multicast Flow Query
   Response message.  The Result field in the response MUST be set to
   Success (0x3).  The Code field MUST be set to 0x000.  The
   Transaction-Id field MUST be copied from the request.

   If the Multicast Flow Query Request contained one (or more) Target
   TLVs, the AN MUST include, for each of these Target TLVs, the
   following set of TLVs:

   o  Target TLV.  This MUST be identical to the Target TLV in the
      received Multicast Flow Query Request message.

   o  Multicast-Flow TLV(s).  The Multicast-Flow TLV MUST appear once
      per multicast flow that is currently active on the AN port
      identified in the preceding Target TLV.

   The Target TLVs MUST appear in the response from the AN in the same
   order as in the query from the NAS.

   If the Multicast Flow Query Request contained one (or more)
   Multicast-Flow TLVs, the AN MUST include, for each of these
   Multicast-Flow TLVs, the following set of TLVs:

   o  Multicast-Flow TLV.  This MUST be identical to the Multicast-Flow
      TLV in the received Multicast Flow Query Request message.

   o  Target TLV(s).  The Target TLV MUST appear once per AN port on
      which the multicast flow identified in the preceding Multicast
      Flow TLV is active.

   The Multicast-Flow TLVs MUST appear in the response from the AN in
   the same order as in the query from the NAS.

   If the Multicast Flow Query Request contained no Target TLV and no
   Multicast Flow TLV, the AN MUST include, for each AN port currently
   receiving multicast flow(s), the following set of TLVs:

   o  Target TLV.  This MUST identify one AN port.

   o  Multicast-Flow TLV(s).  The Multicast-Flow TLV MUST appear once
      per Multicast Flow that is currently active on the AN port
      identified in the preceding Target TLV.

   If the contents of the Multicast Flow Query Request are in error, the
   AN MUST reply with a Multicast Flow Query Response message with the

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   Result field set to Failure (0x4) and the Code field set to indicate
   the nature of the error.  If the request contained multiple instances
   of the Target TLV or the Multicast-Flow TLV and one of these is in
   error, the response message MUST contain the results for the
   preceding instances of the TLV as if there had been no error.  These
   successful results MUST be followed by the TLV in error, copied from
   the request.  The AN MUST NOT do further processing of the request.
   The AN MAY add a Status-Info TLV to provide further information on
   the nature of the error.

   The amount of information in the response to the Multicast Flow Query
   Request may be very large.  The AN MAY pass the information in a
   series of Multicast Flow Query Response messages so that the control
   channel to the NAS is not blocked for too long by transmission of a
   single very large message.  To support this, the receiver MUST set
   the I flag and Submessage Number fields in the header of each
   Multicast Flow Query Response message making up the complete response
   in accordance with the usage of these fields as described in Section
   3.1.1 of [RFC3292].  That is, the initial Multicast Flow Query
   Response message in the sequence MUST have the I flag set (0x1) and
   the Submessage Number field value equal to the total number of
   messages making up the complete response.  The remaining messages in
   the sequence MUST have the I flag cleared (0x0) and the Submessage
   Number field value set to the sequence number of the message within
   the complete sequence, counting from 2 for the second message in the
   sequence.  Moreover, every message in the sequence except the last
   one MUST have the Result field value equal to "More" (0x5).  The
   final message in the response MUST have the Result field set to
   Success (0x3) or Failure (0x4) as the case may be.  The ordering of
   the messages in the sequence MUST be such that they present the
   contents in the same order as if all of the information had been
   presented in just one message, according to the rules described
   above.

   This section defines new ANCP TLVs for the control of multicast
   flows.

5.1.  Multicast-Service-Profile TLV

   This document defines the new Multicast-Service-Profile TLV.

   The Multicast-Service-Profile TLV MAY be included in a Provisioning
   message as specified in Section 4.1.

   The Multicast-Service-Profile TLV is illustrated in Figure 5.  It
   consists of a TLV header encapsulating a single instance of the
   Multicast-Service-Profile-Name TLV and one or more instances of the
   List-Action TLV.

   o  The TLV length is determined by the contents following the TLV
      header.

   o  The Multicast-Service-Profile-Name TLV is described in
      Section 5.2.  The Multicast-Service-Profile-Name TLV MUST contain

      profile when activating it for a given target within a Port
      Management message (see Section 4.2).

   o  The List-Action TLV is described in Section 5.3.  The List-Action
      TLV(s) provide the content of a newly defined multicast service
      profile or modify the existing content.  If more than one List-
      Action TLV is present, the order of the TLVs may be significant,
      since List-Action TLVs are processed in the order in whch they
      appear.

5.2.  Multicast-Service-Profile-Name TLV

   The Multicast-Service-Profile-Name TLV carries the identifier of a
   multicast service profile provisioned on the AN.  It is illustrated
   in Figure 6.

               Figure 6: Multicast-Service-Profile-Name TLV

   The Multicast-Service-Profile-Name TLV has the following fields:

   o  The Multicast-Service-Profile-Name TLV Type is 0x18.

   o  TLV Length: up to 255 octets.

   o  Multicast service profile identifier: an opaque sequence of bits
      identifying a specific multicast service profile.

         The identifier could have the form of human-readable text or an
         arbitrary binary value, depending on the operator's practices.

5.3.  List-Action TLV

   The List-Action TLV identifies multicast flows to be added to or
   removed from a list of White-, Black-, or Grey-listed flows.  It is
   meaningful only in association with a Multicast-Service-Profile-Name
   TLV identifying the profile to which the List-Action TLV applies.
   Such an association can be achieved by placing both TLVs in the same
   base message payload or as embedded TLVs of another TLV such as the
   Multicast-Service-Profile.  The List-Action TLV is shown in Figure 7.

                         Figure 7: List-Action TLV

   The List-Action TLV contains the following fields:

   o  The List-Action TLV Type is 0x21.

   o  TLV Length: length of the subsequent contents.

   o  Operation: operation to be performed upon the White, Black, or
      Grey list identified by the List Type field within the profile
      identified by the associated Multicast-Service-Profile-Name
      embedded TLV.  The possible values are:

      *  Add (0x01): the multicast flow fields are to be added to the
         list.

      *  Delete (0x02): the multicast flow fields are to be removed from
         the list.  Each multicast flow field in the List-Action MUST
         match exactly an existing entry in the list concerned.  Thus to
         remove part of the range provided by a wildcarded list entry,
         it is necessary to remove the entire entry and add back the
         remaining partial range(s).

      *  Replace (0x03): the multicast flow fields replace the existing
         contents of the list.

   o  List Type: the list type being modified by this List-Action.  The
      possible values are White (0x01), Black (0x02), or Grey (0x03).

   o  Reserved: a sender MUST set this field to 0x0000.  A receiver MUST
      ignore the contents of this field.

   o  Address Family: the IP version of the set of multicast flow fields
      that follow, encoded according to [PIMreg].  Possible values are
      0x0001 (IPv4) or 0x0002 (IPv6).  Either an IPv4 list or an IPv6
      list or both MAY be present in the List-Action TLV.

   o  Number of flow fields: the number of multicast flow fields of the
      given address family which follow.

   o  Multicast flow field: a field identifying one or more multicast
      flows.  It consists of an 8-bit group address prefix length, an
      8-bit source address prefix length, a 0-16 octet group prefix, and
      a 0-16 octet source prefix, as shown in Figure 8.

   Each multicast flow field refers either to a Source-Specific
   Multicast (SSM) channel or to an Any Source Multicast (ASM) group.
   The scope of the designation may be broadened to multiple channels or
   groups through use of prefix length values smaller than the total
   address length for the given address family.  Multicast flow fields
   MUST be placed consecutively within the embedded TLV without
   intervening padding except to round out individual addresses to the
   nearest octet boundary.

   A multicast flow field consists of two single-octet prefix lengths
   followed by zero to two prefix values as shown in Figure 8:

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | Group PrefLen |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | Source PrefLen|
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | Group Prefix (multicast)  (0 to 16 octets)                    |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | Source Prefix (unicast, SSM only) (0 to 16 octets)            |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

          Figure 8: Organization of a Single Multicast Flow Field

   The prefix length has its usual meaning.  It is the number of most-
   significant bits specified within the corresponding prefix.  The
   prefix length MAY vary from 0 to 32 in the IPv4 sub-list, and from 0
   to 128 in the IPv6 sub-list.

   A value of 0x00 for either the Group PrefLen (prefix length) or the
   Source PrefLen indicates that any value of the corresponding address
   will match (wild card).  If the value 0x00 is provided for a
   particular prefix length, the corresponding prefix MUST be omitted
   from the field contents.  In particular, a value of 0x00 for the
   Source PrefLen indicates an ASM multicast entry, and the Source
   Prefix will be absent.

   The length of a Source or Group Prefix field is equal to (PrefLen +
   7)/8 octets, truncated to the nearest integer.  Unused bits at the
   end of the prefix MUST be set to zeroes.

5.4.  Sequence-Number TLV

   The Sequence-Number TLV conveys a sequence number of some sort.  The
   specific meaning of the sequence number is message-specific.  Within
   this specification, the Sequence-Number TLV is used as a embedded TLV
   within a Status-Info TLV, in a Generic Response reporting a failed
   command within a Multicast Replication Control or Multicast Admission
   Request message.  It identifies the sequence number within the
   message of the command that failed.

   The Sequence-Number TLV has the format shown in Figure 9.

                        1                   2                   3

                       Figure 9: Sequence-Number TLV

   The Sequence-Number TLV has the following fields:

   o  The Sequence-Number TLV Type is 0x22.

   o  TLV length is 0x0004.

   o  Sequence number: the sequence number of a specific entity within a
      series, where numbering starts from 1 for the first entity in the
      series.  Represented as a 32-bit binary number, most significant
      bit first.

   o  TLV length is 4.

   o  Delegated amount: the bandwidth amount delegated to the AN for
      admission of multicast video on a given port, kilobits per second.
      Presented as a 32-bit binary value, most significant bit first.

5.6.  White-List-CAC TLV

   The White-List-CAC TLV is used to indicate that the NAS wishes the AN
   to do admission control for White-listed flows.  Details on when the
   White-List-CAC TLV may be provisioned are specified in Section 6.
   The White-List-CAC TLV is illustrated in Figure 11.

                        1                   2                   3

5.7.  MRepCtl-CAC TLV

   The MRepCtl-CAC TLV is used to indicate that the NAS wishes the AN to
   do admission control for flows added by the Multicast Replication
   Control message.  Details on when the MRepCtl-CAC TLV may be
   provisioned are specified in Section 6.  The MRepCtl-CAC TLV is
   illustrated in Figure 12.

   The MRepCtl-CAC TLV contains the following fields:

   o  The MRepCtl-CAC TLV Type is 0x25.

   o  TLV length is 0, since the TLV contains no data other than the TLV
      header.

5.8.  Bandwidth-Request TLV

   The Bandwidth-Request TLV is used to request an adjustment of the
   total amount of video bandwidth allocated to the AN for multicast
   admission control for a given line.  The "Required amount" field
   indicates the minimum adjustment required to meet the request.  The
   "Preferred amount" field indicates the adjustment the requestor would
   prefer to have, if possible.  Section 4.5 discusses the required
   relationships between the "Required amount", "Preferred amount", and
   current values of total bandwidth allocated to the AN.

   The Bandwidth-Request TLV has the format shown in Figure 13.

   o  The Multicast-Flow TLV Type is 0x19.

   o  TLV Length: ranges from a minimum of 8 (for an ASM IPv4 flow) to
      36 (for an IPv6 SSM flow.

   o  Flow Type: 0x01 for Any Source Multicast (ASM), 0x02 for Specific-
      Source Multicast (SSM).

   o  Addr Family: address family of the multicast source and group
      addresses, encoded in accordance with the IANA PIM Address Family
      registry ([PIMreg]). 0x01 indicates IPv4, 0x02 indicates IPv6.

   o  Reserved: MUST be set to 0x0000 by the sender and MUST be ignored
      by the receiver.

         One possible use for this field in the future is to indicate
         the presence of PIM Join attributes attached to the source
         address (see [RFC5384]).  The applicability of PIM attributes
         in the context of ANCP is for further study.

   o  Multicast Group Address: a multicast group address within the
      given address family.  The group address MUST always be present.

   o  Unicast Source Address: unicast address within the given address
      family.  If the Flow Type is 0x01 (ASM), a source address MUST NOT
      be present.  If the Flow Type is 0x02 (SSM), a source address MUST
      be present.

6.  Multicast Capabilities

   Section 5.3 of [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] defines a capability
   negotiation mechanism as well as a number of capabilities.  This
   section defines four new capabilities in support of different modes
   of multicast operation:

   o  NAS-initiated replication (capability type 0x05);

   o  conditional access with white and black lists (capability type
      0x06);

   o  conditional access with grey lists (capability type 0x07);

   o  bandwidth delegation (capability type 0x08).

   The "Capability Data" field within the Capability TLV for all of
   these capabilities is empty.

   The remainder of this section consists of three sub-sections.
   Section 6.1 specifies the protocol elements that must be implemented
   in order to support each capability.  Section 6.2 specifies the
   procedures that apply to each capability on its own.  Section 6.3
   specifies how the capabilities interact if more than one multicast
   capability is included in the set of capabilities negotiated between
   the AN and the NAS.

   Note that if a request contains content that is not supported
   (according to the tables in Section 6.1) by the negotiated set of
   multicast capabilities, the appropriate response is to return a
   Generic Response message indicating Failure (0x4) with an appropriate
   code value (e.g., 84 "TLV or value not supported by negotiated
   capability set").  The body of the message MUST contain a Status-Info
   TLV.  See Sections 5.4.5.1 and 5.4.5.2 in [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol]
   for more details.

6.1.  Required Protocol Support

   This section specifies the protocol elements that MUST be implemented
   to support each of the four multicast capabilities.  Support of
   multiple multicast capabilities requires implementation of the union
   of the sets of protocol elements applying to each of the individual
   capabilities in the supported set.

   Table 1 specifies the protocol elements within Section 4 and
   Section 5 that MUST be implemented to support the NAS-initiated

6.2.  Capability-Specific Procedures for Providing Multicast Service

   This section describes multicast service procedures for each
   capability as if it were the only multicast capability within the
   negotiated set.  Procedures involving combinations of multicast
   capabilities are described in Section 6.3.

   The use of the Multicast Flow Query Request and Response messages to
   determine the association between multicast flows and ports is common
   to all multicast capabilities.  No additional text is required here,
   beyond that already given in Section 4.9 to describe the use of those
   messages.

6.2.1.  Procedures For NAS-initiated Replication

   NAS-initiated replication MAY be negotiated to support a mode of
   operation where IGMP/MLD requests are terminated on the NAS.
   Alternatively, it MAY be negotiated to allow the NAS to respond to
   requests sent by other means (e.g., through application signalling)
   that require the replication of multicast channels to a given access
   line.

6.2.1.1.  Provisioning

   The NAS MAY perform admission control for NAS-initiated replication.
   In this case, it MUST NOT include the MRepCtl-CAC TLV in a
   Provisioning message sent to the AN.  Alternatively, the NAS MAY
   enable admission control at the AN for NAS-initiated replication.  To
   do this, it MUST include the MRepCtl-CAC TLV in a Provisioning
   message sent to the AN and it MUST also include a Bandwidth-
   Allocation TLV in a Port Management message for each access line.

6.2.1.2.  Multicast Service Procedures

   The procedures associated with NAS-initiated replication are
   straightforward.  To initiate replication, the NAS MUST send a
   Multicast Replication Control message to the AN, containing one or
   more commands adding flows, as described in Section 4.3.1.  To
   terminate replication the NAS MUST send a Multicast Replication
   Control message where the commands delete instead of adding the
   flows.  The AN acts upon these messages as specified in
   Section 4.3.2.

6.2.2.  Procedures For Conditional Access With Black and White Lists

6.2.2.1.  Provisioning

   The NAS provisions named multicast service profiles containing White
   and Black lists on the AN using the Provisioning message containing
   one or more Multicast-Service-Profile TLVs.  The NAS MAY update the
   contents of these profiles from time to time as required, by sending
   additional Provisioning messages with Multicast-Service-Profile TLVs
   containing incremental modifications to the existing White and Black
   lists or replacements for them.

   The NAS assigns a specific multicast service profile to an individual
   access line using the Port Management message containing a Multicast-
   Service-Profile-Name TLV.  The NAS MAY change the multicast service
   profile for a given access line at any time by sending a Port
   Management message identifying a new multicast service profile.

   The NAS MAY choose to enable admission control at the AN for White-
   listed flows.  To do this, it MUST send a Provisioning message as
   described in Section 4.1, which includes the White-List-CAC TLV and
   it MUST provide a multicast bandwidth allocation for each access line
   by including a Bandwidth-Allocation TLV in a Port Management message.

6.2.2.2.  Multicast Service Procedures

   The conditional access with White and Black lists capability assumes
   that IGMP/MLD requests are terminated on the AN.  When the AN
   receives a "join" request, it MUST check to see whether the requested
   flow is White-listed or Black-listed as described below.  Requests
   for Black-listed flows MUST be discarded.  If the NAS has enabled
   admission control on the AN as described in the previous section, but
   a White-listed flow would cause the amount of committed multicast
   bandwidth to exceed the provisioned limit, the request MUST be
   discarded.  The AN replicates flows passing these checks to the
   access line.

   To determine if a requested flow is White-listed, the AN searches for
   a best match to the flow in the applicable multicast service profile.
   Matching is done on the prefixes specified in the profile, ignoring
   the address bits of lower order than those in the prefix.

   If the requested multicast flow matches multiple lists associated
   with the access line, then the most specific match will be considered
   by the AN.  If the most specific match occurs in multiple lists, the
   Black list entry takes precedence over the White list.  In this
   context, the most specific match is defined as:

   o  first, most specific match (longest prefix length) on the
      multicast flow address (i.e., on G of <S,G>)

   o  then, most specific match (longest prefix length) on the unicast
      source address (i.e. on S of <S,G>)

   If the requested multicast flow is not part of any list, the join
   message SHOULD be discarded by the AN.  This default behavior can
   easily be changed by means of a "catch-all" statement in the White
   list.  For instance, adding (<S=*,G=*>) in the White List would make
   the default behavior to accept join messages for a multicast flow
   that has no other match on any list.

   When the AN receives a "leave" request, it terminates replication of
   the multicast flow.

   If the AN receives a Provisioning message which updates an existing
   multicast service profile, the AN MUST review the status of active
   flows on all ports to which the updated profile is currently
   assigned.  Similarly, if a Port Management message assigns a new
   multicast service profile to a given port, the AN MUST review all
   active flows on that port.  If the most specific match for any flow
   is a Black list entry, the flow MUST be terminated immediately.  If
   any of the remaining flows do not match an entry in the White list,

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   they also MUST be terminated immediately.  White listed flows MUST be
   allowed to continue.

6.2.3.  Procedures For Conditional Access With Grey Lists

6.2.3.1.  Provisioning

   The NAS provisions named multicast service profiles containing Grey
   lists on the AN using the Provisioning message containing one or more
   Multicast-Service-Profile TLVs.  The NAS MAY update the contents of
   these profiles from time to time as required, by sending additional
   Provisioning messages with Multicast-Service-Profile TLVs containing
   incremental modifications to the existing Grey lists or replacements
   for them.

   The NAS assigns a specific multicast service profile to an individual
   access line using the Port Management message containing a Multicast-
   Service-Profile-Name TLV.  The NAS MAY change profiles on the line by
   sending a subsequent Port Management message identifying a new
   profile.

   The NAS MAY perform admission control for grey-listed flows.  In that
   case, the NAS MUST NOT include the MRepCtl-CAC TLV in a Provisioning
   message sent to the AN.  Alternatively, the NAS MAY enable admission
   control at the AN for Grey-listed flows.  To do this, it MUST include
   the MRepCtl-CAC TLV in a Provisioning message sent to the AN and MUST
   also provide a Bandwidth-Allocation TLV in a Port Management message
   for each access line.

6.2.3.2.  Multicast Service Procedures

   The conditional access with Grey lists capability assumes that IGMP/
   MLD requests are terminated on the AN.  When the AN receives a "join"
   request, it MUST determine whether there is a match to the requested
   flow in the Grey list of the multicast service profile provisioned
   against the given access line.  If there is no match, the request is
   discarded.  Otherwise, the AN MUST send a Multicast Admission Control
   message to the NAS with content identifying the access line and the
   multicast flow to be added.  As indicated in Section 4.4, the AN MAY
   add information identifying the requestor by IP address and/or MAC
   address.

   If the NAS decides to enable the flow, it MUST send a Multicast
   Replication Control request to the AN to replicate the flow to the
   access line with the Result field set to Nack (0x1), as described in
   Section 4.3.1.

   When the AN receives the Multicast Replication Control request, it



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 54]

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   performs admission control if admission control has been enabled as
   described in the previous section.  If admitting the flow would cause
   the committed multicast bandwidth at the access line to exceed the
   provisioned limit, the AN reports an error to the NAS as described in
   Section 4.3.2.  Otherwise it replicates the multicast flow as
   requested.

   If the NAS decides not to permit the flow, it MAY send a Multicast
   Replication Control message in response to the Multicast Admission
   Control message to allow the AN to update its internal records.  The
   content of this message is described in Section 4.4.2.

   When the AN receives a "leave" request, it MUST terminate replication
   of the flow to the access line.  It MUST then send a Multicast
   Admission Control message to the NAS indicating the deletion.  The
   NAS updates its internal records but MUST NOT respond to the message.

   If the AN receives a Provisioning message which updates an existing
   multicast service profile, the AN MUST review the status of active
   flows on all ports to which the updated profile has been assigned.
   Similarly, if a Port Management message that assigns a new profile to
   a given port, the AN MUST review all active flows on that port.  In
   either case, if any flow does not match an entry in the Grey list, it
   MUST be terminated immediately.

6.2.4.  Procedures For Delegated Bandwidth

6.2.4.1.  Provisioning

   The NAS SHOULD provision an initial amount of delegated multicast
   bandwidth for each access line using the Port Management message
   containing the Bandwidth-Allocation TLV.

      If it fails to do so and a value has not been provisioned on the
      AN by other means, the AN will be forced to request a bandwidth
      allocation as soon as it receives a "join" request.

   The NAS MAY at any time force an update of the amount of delegated
   bandwidth by the same means.

6.2.4.2.  Multicast Service Procedures

   The delegated bandwidth capability assumes that IGMP/MLD requests are
   terminated on the AN.  When the AN receives a "join" request, it
   checks whether it has sufficient remaining uncommitted multicast
   bandwidth on the access line to accommodate the new multicast flow.
   If not, it MAY send a request to the NAS for an increased allocation
   of delegated bandwidth, using the Bandwidth Reallocation Request

   message.  The NAS MUST return a Bandwidth Transfer message indicating
   whether it has granted the request, and if so, what is the new amount
   of delegated bandwidth.

   If the AN has sufficient uncommitted multicast capacity to admit the
   request, either originally or as the result of a successful request
   to the NAS, it replicates the requested flow to the access line.
   Otherwise it discards the request.

   When the AN receives a "leave" request for an active flow, it ceases
   replication.

   The NAS or AN MAY at some point detect that their respective views of
   the amount of delegated bandwidth are inconsistent.  If so, they can
   recover using procedures described in Section 4.5 and Section 4.6.
   As a further aid to synchronization, either the NAS or the AN MAY
   from time to time check the peer's view of the amount of delegated
   bandwidth using the Delegated Bandwidth Query message.

   The NAS or AN MAY at any time release bandwidth to the peer using an
   autonomous Bandwidth Transfer message.  The contents of this message
   are described in Section 4.6.

6.3.  Combinations of Multicast Capabilities

6.3.1.  Combination of Conditional Access With White and Black Lists and
        Conditional Access With Grey Lists

   If conditional access with White and Black lists is combined with
   conditional access with Grey lists, provisioning of the multicast
   service profiles is as described in Section 6.2.2.1 except that
   multicast service profiles will also include Grey lists.  Admission
   control is enabled independently on the AN for White lists by
   including the White-list-CAC TLV in the Provisioning message and for
   Grey lists by including the MRepCtl-CAC TLV in the Provisioning
   message.  The Bandwidth-Allocation TLV provisions an amount that
   applies to both White- and Grey- listed flows if admission control is
   enabled for both.

   With regard to multicast service procedures, one point of difference
   from the individual capabilities must be noted.  This is an
   interaction during the profile matching procedure.  The AN MUST seek
   the best match amongst multiple lists as described in
   Section 6.2.2.2.  However, if there are multiple matches of equal
   precision, the order of priority is Black list first, Grey list
   second, and White list last.

   Once profile matching has been completed, processing of a "join"

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   request is as described in Section 6.2.2.2 for White or Black listed
   flows or Section 6.2.3.2 for Grey listed flows.  Requests that do not
   match any list SHOULD be discarded.

   When the AN receives a "leave" request, it MUST terminate replication
   of the flow to the access line.  If the flow was Grey-listed, the AN
   MUST then send a Multicast Admission Control message to the NAS
   indicating the deletion.  Thus the AN needs to retain the fact that
   the flow was Grey-listed for the life of the flow.

   If the AN receives a Provisioning message which updates an existing
   multicast service profile, the AN MUST review the status of active
   flows on all ports to which the updated profile is currently
   assigned.  Similarly, if a Port Management message assigns a new
   multicast service profile to a given port, the AN MUST review all
   active flows on that port.  If any flow has its most specific match
   in a Black list entry, it MUST be terminated immediately.  If any of
   the remaining flows do not match an entry in the White or Grey list,
   they MUST also be terminated immediately.  Finally, if any remaining
   flows were originally admitted because they were White-listed, but
   after the change they are Grey-listed, the AN MUST generate a
   Multicast Flow Query response message autonomously as if it were
   responding to a Multicast Flow Query request, listing all such flows.
   These flows MUST be allowed to continue until the NAS or the
   subscriber terminates them.  Flows with their most specific match in
   the White list MUST be allowed to continue.

   The autonomously-generated Multicast Flow Query response message MUST
   be formatted as if it were a successful response to a request
   containing no Target and no Multicast-Flow TLV, as described in
   Section 4.9.2, with the exception that the Transaction-Id MUST be set
   to all zeroes.

6.3.2.  Combination of Conditional Access With Delegated Bandwidth

   The provisioning and bandwidth management procedures of Section 6.2.4
   apply in addition to the procedures in Section 6.2.2, Section 6.2.3,
   or Section 6.3.1 as applicable.  Admission control follows the rules
   for conditional access in terms of matching flows against White and
   Black and/or Grey lists and performing or not performing bandwidth
   checks at the AN, but the amount of bandwidth used by the AN to
   perform admission control is negotiable as described in
   Section 6.2.4.2.

6.3.3.  Combination of NAS-Initiated Replication with Other Capabilities

   NAS-initiated replication can coexist with the other capabilities,
   but some means must exist to prevent double replication of flows.



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 57]

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   The simplest way to do this is to terminate all IGMP/MLD requests on
   the AN, so that NAS-initiated replication is stimulated only by
   signalling through other channels.  Other arrangements are possible,
   but need not be discussed here.

   Assuming the necessary separation of responsibilities, the only point
   of interaction between NAS-initiated replication and the other
   multicast capabilities is in the area of admission control.
   Specifically, inclusion of the MRepCtl-CAC TLV in a Provisioning
   message and the Bandwidth-Allocation TLV in a Port Management message
   enables admission control by the AN for flows added by Multicast
   Replication Control messages, regardless of whether they are part of
   NAS-initiated replication or Grey list multicast service processing.
   Conversely, non inclusion of the MRepCtl-CAC TLV in Provisioning
   messages to the AN enables admission control by the NAS for flows
   added by Multicast Replication Control messages, regardless of
   whether they are part of NAS- initiated replication or Grey list
   multicast service processing.  Admission Control for white flows can
   also be enabled independently on the AN by inclusion by the NAS of
   the White-List-CAC TLV in the Provisioning message.

Appendix A.  Example of Messages and Message Flows

   This appendix provides an example in which most of the possible
   message flows for multicast control are illustrated.  This appendix
   is for informational purposes only.  In case of discrepancy with text
   of the body of this document, the text in the body of the document is
   to be considered as the normative text.

   Assume the following, for a given access port:

   o  The basic subscribed service is white-listed.  The AN will be
      responsible for admission control for this service.

   o  Some premium services are available, but requests for these
      services must be referred to the policy server for proper credit
      processing.  For this reason they are grey-listed.  The NAS will
      be responsible for admission control for these services.

   o  The subscriber has asked that certain services be blocked so that
      his children cannot view them.  These services are black-listed.

   o  All of the above services are Source-Specific Multicast (SSM).  In
      addition, by means which bypass the AN, the subscriber can signal
      intent to join an on-line game service which is Any-Source
      Multicast (ASM).  The NAS is responsible for admission control for
      this service.

   o  Bandwidth delegation is in effect to share video bandwidth between
      the AN and the NAS.

   The stated conditions require the use of all four of the capabilities
   specified in this memo.

A.1.  Provisioning Phase

   Assume that capability negotiation has been completed between the AN
   and NAS and that the set of negotiated capabilities includes the
   following four multicast capabilities: NAS-initiated replication,
   conditional access with white and black list, conditional access with
   grey list, and bandwidth delegation.  At this point, the NAS can
   provision the service profiles on the AN and enable admission control
   at the AN for white-listed flows.  To do this, the NAS sends the AN a
   Provisioning message containing this information.  An example message
   providing the profile for our assumed subscriber is shown in
   Figure 17.  The message has the following contents:

   o  Message type is 93.

   o  The Result and Code fields in the header are set to zeroes, as
      specified in the ANCP base protocol document.

   o  A Transaction identifier is assigned by the NAS.

   o  The Multicast-Service-Profile TLV (of which typically there would
      be multiple instances) contains a Multicast-Service-Profile-Name
      TLV (with a length of 20 octets assumed for the example) and three
      List-Action TLVs, one each for the White, Grey, and Black lists
      within the profile.  The White list flows come in two sets of
      group addresses: 233.252.0.0/29, coming from a server at
      192.0.2.15, and 233.252.0.32/29, coming from a server at
      192.0.2.16.  The Grey listed flows are in the band
      233.252.0.64/29, coming from a server at 192.0.2.21.  Finally, the
      Black list flows are two individual flows that happen to overlap
      with the Grey list band: 233.252.0.65, and 233.252.0.69, also with
      source 192.0.2.21.

   o  The White-List-CAC TLV indicates that the AN does admission
      control on White-listed flows.

   TLV lengths are given in decimal for easier understanding.  Note that
   the padding after the middle List-Action TLV is counted as part of
   length of the Multicast-Service-Profile TLV, but is not included in

   As soon as the AN port comes up, the AN sends an ANCP PORT_UP message
   to the NAS specifying the Access Loop Circuit ID.  The NAS replies
   with an ANCP Port Management message that, together with the other
   parameters, includes the multicast service profile name to be
   associated to that port along with the initial amount of delegated
   bandwidth.  The corresponding message flow is illustrated in
   Figure 18.

   The Port Management message will typically contain other TLVs but our
   example (Figure 19) just shows the Target, Multicast-Service-Profile-
   Name, and Bandwidth-Allocation TLVs.  The Target TLV identifies the
   subscriber line, the Multicast-Service-Profile-Name TLV is identical
   to the one contained in the Provisioning message, and the Bandwidth-
   Allocation TLV provides just enough bandwidth (2000 kbits/s) for one
   channel to start with.

   The following fields in the Port Management message header are shown
   with specific values either as directed by the base protocol document
   or for the sake of our example:

A.2.  Handling a Grey-Listed Flow

   Suppose now that the subscriber chooses to watch the premium channel
   characterized by source 192.0.2.21, group 233.252.0.67.  Upon
   receiving the Join request, the AN matches it against the multicast
   service profile for the port and determines that it is a Grey-listed
   flow.  Figure 20 illustrates the resulting ANCP message flow for the
   case of a simple join and leave, when admission control for Grey-
   listed flows is not activated on the AN.  To start the flow, the AN
   sends a Multicast Admission Control request (M1) to the NAS.  The NAS
   decides whether flow can be admitted, applying both policy and
   bandwidth criteria.  It returns its decision (positive in this
   example) in a Multicast Replication Control message (M2).  Later,
   when the subscriber leaves the flow, the AN informs the NAS by
   sending another Multicast Admission Control message.

      Multicast Admission Control Message Signalling flow Termination

A.3.  Handling White-Listed Flows

   The NAS has enabled White list admission control on the AN, and the
   bandwidth delegation capability has been negotiated.  White listed
   flows in themselves require no messages to the NAS, either upon
   admission or upon termination, but the AN may request an increase in
   the amount of delegated bandwidth if it needs the increase to admit a
   flow.

   Consider an example where the AN has already admitted one White-
   listed flow, thereby using up the initially provisioned amount of
   delegated bandwidth (2000 kbits/s).  A request is received to join a



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 77]

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   new flow in the White list range.  The AN chooses to send a Bandwidth
   Reallocation Request message to the NAS, requesting that the
   delegated bandwidth allocation be increased to 4000 kbits/s at a
   minimum, and preferably to 6000 kbits/s.

   In our example, the NAS is managing bandwidth tightly, as witnessed
   by its minimal initial allocation of just enough for one flow.  It is
   willing to provide the minimum additional amount only, and therefore
   returns a Bandwidth Transfer message where the delegated bandwidth
   value is given as 4000 kbits/s.  With this amount, the AN is able to
   admit the second White-listed flow.  The AN could send a similar
   Bandwidth Transfer message back to the NAS bringing the delegated
   bandwidth amount back down to 2000 kbits/s when one of the flows is
   terminated, but this shows nothing new and is omitted.

   As one more point of illustration, suppose that the NAS chooses to
   audit the current amount of delegated bandwidth to ensure it is
   synchronized with the AN.  It sends a Delegated Bandwidth Query
   request message to the AN, and receives a Delegated Bandwidth Query
   response message with the current allocation as the AN sees it.

   The complete message flow is shown in Figure 22.

A.4.  Handling Of Black-Listed Join Requests

   This section introduces no new messages, since requests for flows in
   the Black list are simply ignored.  The one thing to point out is the
   overlap in our example between the set of flows in the Grey list and
   the flows in the Black list.  This does not create any ambiguity,
   since not only does the Black list have priority for equally good
   matches, but also the Black list entries are more specific (group
   prefix lengths of 32 versus 29 in the Grey list) than the Grey list
   flow prefixes.

A.5.  Handling Of Requests To Join and Leave the On-Line Game

   The final class of multicast control actions in our example allows
   the subscriber to enter and leave the on-line game.  As described at
   the beginning of this example, the game uses Any Source Multicast
   (ASM).  Subscriber signalling bypasses the AN, going directly to the
   NAS (e.g., through a web interface).



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 82]

Internet-Draft          ANCP Multicast Extensions             March 2010


   When the subscriber requests to join the game, the NAS (after
   applying policy and bandwidth checks) sends a Multicast Replication
   Control message to the AN to enable the flow on the port concerned.
   The AN knows not to apply admission control, since it has not
   received an MRepCtl-CAC TLV in the Provisioning message.  When the
   subscriber leaves, the NAS sends another Multicast Replication
   Control message to delete the flow.  This message sequence is shown
   in Figure 27.

   It is possible that the NAS finds that there is not enough bandwidth
   available to accommodate the subscriber's request.  In this case, the
   NAS could send a Bandwidth Reallocation Request message to the AN,
   asking it to release some of the bandwidth delegated to it.  This is
   not shown in the present example, since the messages are the same as
   those already presented with the exception that the Preferred Amount
   in the request will be *less than* or equal to the Required amount,
   rather than *greater than* or equal to it.

   the message in Figure 21 with two exceptions.  The first is that the
   NAS has the option to set the Result field to AckAll (0x02) if it
   needs positive reassurance that the flow has been enabled.  This was
   not done here to save having to depict a response differing only in
   the Result field.  The larger difference in this example is that the
   flow description in the Multicast-Flow embedded TLV is that of an ASM
   multicast group (Flow Type = 0x01) with IPv4 (0x01) group address
   233.252.1.100.

A.6.  Example Flow For Multicast Flow Reporting

   The example in this section is independent of the example in the
   preceding sections.

   Figure 29 illustrates a message flow in a case where the NAS queries
   the AN about which multicast flows are active on port 10, on port 20
   and on port 11 of the AN.

   The Multicast Flow Query Request message (M1) is illustrated in
   Figure 30.  The Message Type is 149.  The Result field is set to
   AckAll (0x2).  Three Target TLVs are present, identifying port 10,
   port 20, and port 11 respectively.
