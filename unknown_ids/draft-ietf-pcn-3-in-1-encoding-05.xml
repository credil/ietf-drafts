      <t>
        The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
        quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain.
        On every link in the PCN domain, the overall rate of the PCN-traffic is 
        metered, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain
        configured rates are exceeded. Egress nodes provide decision points with 
        information about the PCN-marks of PCN-packets which allows them to take 
        decisions about whether to admit or block a new flow request, and to 
        terminate some already admitted  flows during serious pre-congestion.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document specifies how PCN-marks are to be encoded into the IP header 
        by re-using the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) codepoints within a 
        PCN-domain.  This encoding builds on the baseline encoding of RFC5696 and 
        provides for three different PCN marking states using a single DSCP: 
        not-marked (NM), threshold-marked (ThM) and excess-traffic-marked (ETM). 
        Hence, it is called the 3-in-1 PCN encoding.

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) <xref target="RFC5559"/> 
        is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a 
        Diffserv domain, in a simple, scalable, and robust fashion. Two mechanisms 
        are used: admission control, to decide whether to admit or block a new flow 
        request, and flow termination to terminate some existing
		flows during serious pre-congestion. To achieve this, the overall 
        rate of PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the domain, and PCN-packets 
        are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are exceeded. These 
        configured rates are below the rate of the link thus providing notification 
        to boundary nodes about overloads before any real congestion occurs (hence 
        "pre-congestion notification").
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC5670"/> provides for two metering and marking functions 
        that are configured with reference rates. Threshold-marking marks all PCN 
        packets once their traffic rate on a link exceeds  the configured reference 
        rate (PCN-threshold-rate). Excess-traffic-marking marks only those PCN 
        packets that exceed the configured reference rate (PCN-excess-rate). The 
        PCN-excess-rate is typically larger than the PCN-threshold-rate 
        <xref target="RFC5559"/>. Egress nodes monitor the PCN-marks of received 
        PCN-packets and provide information about the PCN-marks to decision points 
        which take decisions about flow admission and termination on this basis 
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour"/>, 
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-sm-edge-behaviour"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The baseline encoding defined in <xref target="RFC5696"/> describes how two 
        PCN marking states (Not-marked and PCN-Marked) can be encoded using a single Diffserv codepoint. It also 
		provides an experimental codepoint (EXP), along with guidelines for use of that codepoint. 
		To support the application of two different marking algorithms in a 
        PCN-domain, for example as required in 
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour"/>, three PCN marking states are 
        needed. This document describes an extension to the baseline encoding that 
        uses the EXP codepoint to provide a third PCN marking state in the IP header, still using a single 
        Diffserv codepoint. This encoding scheme is called "3-in-1 PCN encoding".
      </t>
     
      <t>
        This document only concerns the PCN wire protocol encoding for all IP 
        headers, whether IPv4 or IPv6. It makes no changes or recommendations 
        concerning algorithms for congestion marking or congestion response. Other 
        documents define the PCN wire protocol for other header types. For example, 
        the MPLS encoding is defined in <xref target="RFC5129"/> and Appendix A of that document provides 
        an informative example for a mapping between the encodings in IP and in MPLS.

               title="PCN Requirements">
        <t>
          In accordance with the PCN architecture <xref target="RFC5559"/>,
          PCN-ingress-nodes control packets entering a PCN-domain. Packets 
          belonging to PCN-controlled flows are subject to PCN-metering and 
          -marking, and PCN-ingress-nodes mark 
          them as Not-marked (PCN-colouring). Any node in the PCN-domain may 
          perform PCN-metering and -marking and mark PCN-packets if needed. 
          There are two different metering and marking schemes: threshold-marking 
          and excess-traffic-marking <xref target="RFC5670"/>. Some edge 
          behaviors require only a single marking scheme 
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-sm-edge-behaviour"/>, others require both 
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour"/>. In the latter case, 
          three PCN marking states are needed: not-marked (NM) to indicate 
          not-marked packets, threshold-marked (ThM) to indicate packets marked 
          by the threshold-marker, and excess-traffic-marked (ETM) to indicate 
          packets marked by the excess-traffic-marker <xref target="RFC5670"/>. 
          Threshold-marking and excess-traffic-marking are configured to start marking packets 
          at different load conditions, so one marking scheme indicates more severe 
          pre-congestion than the other. Therefore, a fourth PCN 
          marking state indicating that a packet is marked by both markers is 
          not needed. However a fourth codepoint is required to indicate packets
		  that are not PCN-capable (the not-PCN codepoint).
        </t>

        <t>
          In all current PCN edge behaviors that use two marking schemes 
          <xref target="RFC5559"/>, <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour"/>, 
          excess-traffic-marking is configured with a larger reference rate than 
          threshold-marking. We take this as a rule and define excess-traffic-marked 
          as a more severe PCN-mark than threshold-marked.

        <t>
          The baseline encoding scheme <xref target="RFC5696"/> was defined so that 
          it could be extended to accommodate an additional marking state. It provides 
          rules to embed the encoding of two PCN states in the IP header.

          Baseline encoding defines that the DSCP must be set to a PCN-compatible DSCP n 
          and the ECN-field <xref target="RFC3168"/> indicates the specific PCN-mark. 
          Baseline encoding offers four possible encoding states within a single DSCP 
          with the following restrictions.
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Codepoint `00´ (not-ECT) is used to indicate non-PCN traffic as "not-PCN".

		EXP codepoint are fully compatible with <xref target="RFC6040"></xref>. In particular,
		the relative severity of each marking is the same: CE (PM) is more severe than ECT(1) (EXP) is more
		severe than ECT(0) (NM). This is discussed in more detail in both the baseline encoding document

          The 3-in-1 encoding is applicable in situations where two marking schemes are being used in the PCN-domain.

		  on choosing an encoding scheme can be found in <xref target="pcn3in1_Recommendation_PCN_Encoding_Schemes"/>.
		  
		  All nodes within the PCN-domain MUST be fully compliant with the

        Like baseline encoding, 3-in-1 PCN encoding also uses a PCN compatible DSCP n

             title="Behaviour of a PCN Node Compliant with the 3-in-1 PCN Encoding">
      <t>
        To be compliant with the 3-in-1 PCN Encoding, an PCN interior node
        behaves as follows:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>It MUST change NM to ThM if the threshold-meter function
          indicates a need to mark the packet;</t>
          <t>It MUST change NM or ThM to ETM if the excess-traffic-meter
          function indicates a need to mark the packet;</t>
          <t>It MUST NOT change not-PCN to NM, ThM, or ETM;</t>
		  <t>It MUST NOT change a NM, ThM, or ETM to not-PCN;</t>
          <t>It MUST NOT change ThM to NM;</t>
          <t>It MUST NOT change ETM to ThM or to NM;</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        In other words, a PCN interior node MUST NOT mark PCN-packets into non-PCN 
        packets and vice-versa, and it may increase the severity of the PCN-mark of 
        a PCN-packet, but it MUST NOT decrease it.

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_Backward_Compatibility"
             title="Backward Compatibility">
      <t>
        Discussion of backward compatibility between PCN encoding schemes and previous 
        uses of the ECN field is given in Section 6 of <xref target="RFC5696"/>.
      </t>

      <section anchor="pcn3in1_Backward_Compatibility_pre-PCN"
               title="Backward Compatibility with Pre-existing PCN Implementations">
        <t>
          This encoding complies with the rules for extending the baseline PCN encoding 
          schemes in Section 5 of <xref target="RFC5696"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The term "compatibility" is meant in the following sense. It is
          possible to operate nodes with baseline encoding <xref target="RFC5696"/> and 3-in-1
          encoding in the same PCN domain. The nodes with baseline encoding
          MUST perform excess-traffic-marking because the 11 codepoint of
          3-in-1 encoding also means excess-traffic-marked.
          PCN-boundary-nodes of such domains are required to interpret the
          full 3-in-1 encoding and not just baseline encoding, otherwise
          they cannot interpret the 01 codepoint.
        </t>
        <t>
          Using nodes that perform only excess-traffic-marking may make
          sense in networks using the CL edge behavior
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour"/>. Such nodes are able to notify
          the egress only about severe pre-congestion when traffic needs to
          be terminated. This seems reasonable for locations that are not
          expected to see any pre-congestion, but excess-traffic-marking
          gives them a means to terminate traffic if unexpected overload
           occurs.

            If both excess-traffic-marking and threshold-marking are enabled in a

          <t>
            If only excess-traffic-marking is enabled in a PCN-domain, baseline 
            encoding or 3-in-1 encoding may be used. They lead to the same encoding 
            because PCN-boundary nodes will interpret baseline "PCN-marked (PM)" 
            as "excess-traffic-marked (ETM)".

        <section anchor="pcn3in1_Recommendation_PCN_Encoding_Schemes_TM"
                 title="Unique Use of Threshold-Marking">
          <t>
            No scheme is currently proposed that solely uses threshold-marking. If such 
			a scheme is proposed, the choice of encoding scheme will depend on whether
			nodes are compliant with <xref target="RFC6040"/> or not. Where it is certain
			that all nodes in the PCN-domain are compliant then either 3-in-1 encoding 
			or baseline encoding are suitable. If legacy tunnel decapsulators exist 
			within the PCN-domain then baseline encoding SHOULD be used.

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_Sec_Consider" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        The security concerns relating to this extended PCN encoding are the same 
        as those in <xref target="RFC5696"/>. In summary, PCN-boundary nodes are 
        responsible for ensuring inappropriate PCN markings do not leak into or 
        out of a PCN domain, and the current phase of the PCN architecture assumes 
        that all the nodes of a PCN-domain are entirely under the control of a 
        single operator, or a set of operators who trust each other.
      </t>
      <t>
        Given the only difference between the baseline encoding and the present 
        3-in-1 encoding is the use of the 01 codepoint, no new security issues are 
        raised, as this codepoint was already available for experimental use in 
        the baseline encoding.

    </section>

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_Conclusions" title="Conclusions">
      <t>
        The 3-in-1 PCN encoding uses a PCN-compatible DSCP and the ECN field to 
        encode PCN-marks. One codepoint allows non-PCN traffic to be carried with 
        the same PCN-compatible DSCP and three other codepoints support three PCN 
        marking states with different levels of severity.  The use of this PCN 
        encoding scheme presupposes that any tunnels in the PCN region have been 
        updated to comply with <xref target="RFC6040"/>.

	<section anchor="pcn3in1_Appendix" title="Co-existence of ECN and PCN (informative)">
      <t>
      The PCN encoding described in this document re-uses the bits of the ECN field
	  in the IP header. Consequently, this disables ECN within the PCN domain.
	  Appendix B of <xref target="RFC5696"/> included advice on handling ECN traffic within
	  a PCN-domain. This appendix clarifies that advice.</t>
	  
	  <t>
	  For the purposes of this appendix we define two forms of traffic that might arrive
	  at a PCN-ingress node. These are Admission-controlled traffic and Non-admission-controlled 
	  traffic.</t>
	  <t> Admission-controlled traffic will be remarked to the PCN-compatible DSCP by
	  the PCN-ingress node. Two mechanisms can be used to identify such traffic:
	  <list style="letters">
		<t>flow signalling associates a filterspec with a need for admission control 
		(e.g. through RSVP or some equivalent message down from a SIP server to the 
		ingress), and the PCN-ingress remarks traffic matching that filterspec to a 
		PCN-compatible DSCP, as its chosen admission control mechanism.</t>
		<t>Traffic arrives with a DSCP that implies it requires admission control such 
		as VOICE-ADMIT <xref target="RFC5865"/> or Interactive Real-Time, Broadcast TV 
		when used for video on demand, and Multimedia Conferencing 
		<xref target="RFC4594"/><xref target="RFC5865"/>.</t>
	  </list>
	  </t>
	  <t>All other traffic can be thought of as Non-admission-controlled. However such traffic
	  may still need to share the same DSCP as the Admission-controlled traffic. This may be 
	  due to policy (for instance if it is high priority voice traffic), or may be because there
	  is a shortage of local DSCPs.</t>
	
	  <t>
	  ECN <xref target="RFC3168"/> is an end-to-end congestion notification mechanism. As such it is 
	  possible that some traffic entering the PCN-domain may also be ECN capable The following lists the 
	  four cases for how e2e ECN traffic may wish to be treated while crossing a PCN domain:

	  <list style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="ECN capable traffic that does not require admission control and does 
			not carry a DSCP that the PCN-ingress is using for PCN-capable traffic.">
	  This requires no action.</t>
	  <t hangText="ECN capable traffic that does not require admission control but carries a DSCP that the 
			PCN-ingress is using for PCN-capable traffic.">
	  There are two options.</t><t> <list style="symbols">
		<t> The ingress maps the DSCP to a local DSCP with the same scheduling PHB as the original DSCP,
		and the egress re-maps it to the original PCN-compatible DSCP.</t>
		<t> The ingress tunnels the traffic, setting not-PCN in the outer header; 
		note that this turns off ECN  for this traffic within the PCN domain.</t>
		</list>
	 The first option is recommended unless the operator is short of local DSCPs.
	 </t>
	  <t hangText="ECN-capable Admission-controlled traffic:">
	  There are two options.</t><t> <list style="symbols">
		<t>The PCN-ingress places this traffic in a tunnel with a PCN-compatible DSCP in the 
		outer header. The PCN-egress zeroes the ECN-field before decapsulation.</t>
		<t>The PCN-ingress drops CE-marked packets and the PCN-egress zeros the ECN field of  
		all PCN packets.</t>
		</list>
	  The second option is not recommended unless tunnelling is not possible for some reason..
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="ECN-capable Admission-controlled where the e2e transport somehow indicates that it wants to see PCN marks:"> 
	  NOTE this is currently experimental only.</t>
	  <t>Schemes have been suggested where PCN marks may be leaked out of the PCN-domain and used by the end
	  hosts to modify realtime data rates. Currently all such schemes are experimental and the following is 
	  for guidance only.</t>
	  <t>
	  The PCN-ingress needs to tunnel the traffic using <xref target="RFC6040"/>.  The PCN-egress
	  should not zero the ECN field, and the tunnel egress should use <xref target="RFC6040"/> normal mode
	  (preserving any PCN-marking). Note that this may turn ECT(0) into ECT(1) and so is not compatible 
	  with the experimental ECN nonce <xref target="RFC3540"/>.
	  </t>
	  </list>
      </t>
	  <t>In the list above any form of IP-in-IP tunnel can be used unless specified otherwise. 
	  NB, We assume a logical separation of tunneling and PCN actions in both PCN-ingress
	  and PCN-egress nodes. That is, any tunneling action happens wholly outside the
	  PCN-domain as illustrated in the following figure:
