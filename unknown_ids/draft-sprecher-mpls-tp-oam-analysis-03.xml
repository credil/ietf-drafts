    <abstract>
      <t>The intention of this document is to analyze the set of 
      requirements for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) for the 
      Transport Profile of MPLS(MPLS-TP) as defined in [MPLS-TP OAM Requirements], 
      to evaluate whether existing MPLS OAM tools can be applied to these 
      requirements. Eventually, the purpose of the document is to recommend which 
      of the existing tools should be extended and what new tools should be defined 
      to support the set of OAM requirements for MPLS-TP.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) plays a significant
      and fundamental role in carrier networks, providing methods for fault 
      management and performance monitoring in both the transport and the 
      service layers in order to improve their ability to support services with
      guaranteed and strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) while reducing their 
      operational costs.</t>
      <t>[MPLS-TP Requirements] in general, and [MPLS-TP OAM Requirements] 
      in particular define a set of requirements for OAM functionality in MPLS-Transport 
      Profile (MPLS-TP) for MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs) (network infrastructure) 
      and Pseudowires (PWs) (services).</t>

      <t>The purpose of this document is to analyze the OAM requirements and 
      evaluate whether existing OAM tools defined for MPLS can be used to 
      meet the requirements, identify which tools need to be extended to 
      comply with the requirements, and which new tools need to be defined. 
      The existing tools that are evaluated include LSP Ping (defined in 
      [LSP Ping]), MPLS Bi-directional Forwarding Detection (BFD) (defined in 
      [MPLS BFD]) and Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) (defined in 
      [PW VCCV] and [VCCV BFD]).</t>

      <section title="LSP Ping">
      <t>LSP Ping is a variation of ICMP Ping and traceroute [ICMP] adapted to 
      the different needs of MPLS LSP.  Forwarding, of the LSP Ping packets, is 
      based upon the LSP Label and label stack, in order to guarantee that the 
      echo messages are switched in-band (i.e. over the same data route) of the LSP.
      However, it should be noted that the messages are transmitted using IP/UDP 
      encapsulation and IP addresses in the 127/8 (loopback) range.  The use of 
      the loopback range guarantees that the LSP Ping messages will be terminated, 
      by a loss of connectivity or inability to continue on the path, without being 
      transmitted beyond the LSP. </t>

      <t>LSP Ping extends the basic ICMP Ping operation (of data-plane connectivity and 
      continuity check) with functionality to verify data-plane vs. control-plane 
      consistency for a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) and also Maximum Transmission 
      Unit (MTU) problems.  The traceroute functionality may be used to isolate and localize 
      the MPLS faults, using the Time-to-live (TTL) indicator to incrementally identify the 
      sub-path of the LSP that is succesfully traversed before the faulty link or node.  LSP 
      Ping is not dependent on the MPLS control-plane for its operation, i.e. even though the 
      propagation of the LSP label may be performed over the control-plane via the Label 
      Distribution Protocol (LDP).</t>
      <t>LSP Ping can be activated both in on-demand and pro-active (asynchronous)
      modes, as defined in [MPLS-TP OAM Requirements]. </t>

      <t>[P2MP LSP Ping] clarifies the applicability of LSP Ping to MPLS P2MP 
      LSPs, and extends the techniques and mechanisms of LSP Ping to the MPLS 
      P2MP environment.</t>
      
      <t>[LSP Ping over MPLS Tunnels] extends LSP Ping to operate over MPLS 
      tunnels or for a stitched LSP.</t>

      <t>As pointed out above, TTL exhaust is the method used to terminate flows at
      intermediate LSRs, usually to locate a problem that was discovered previously.</t>
      <t>Some of the drawbacks identified with LSP Ping include - LSP Ping is considered 
      to be computational intensive as pointed out in [MPLS BFD].  When LSP bundling is
      employed in the network, there is no guarantee that the LSP Ping packets will 
      follow the same physical path used by the data traffic.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="MPLS BFD">
      <t>BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) is a mechanism that is defined 
      for fast fault detection for point-to-point connections.  BFD defines a simple packet
      that may be transmitted over any protocol, dependent on the application that is 
      employing the mechanism.  BFD is dependent upon creation of a session that 
      is agreed upon by both ends of the link (which may be a single link, LSP, 
      etc.) that is being checked.  In addition to the control packets that BFD 
      defines, BFD supports an echo function to check the continuity, and verify 
      the reachability of the desired destination.  BFD does not support neither a 
      discovery mechanism nor a traceroute capability for fault localization, these 
      must be provided by use of other mechanisms.  The BFD packets support 
      authentication between the routers being checked.</t>

      <t>BFD can be used in pro-active (asynchronous) and on-demand modes, as defined 
      in [MPLS-TP OAM Requirements], of operation.</t>

      <t>[MPLS BFD] defines the use of BFD for P2P LSP end-points and is used to 
      verify data-plane continuity. It uses a simple hello protocol which can be 
      easily implemented in hardware. The end-points of the LSP exchange hello packets 
      at negotiated regular intervals and an end-point is declared down when expected 
      hello packets do not show up.  Failures in each direction can be monitored 
      independently using the same BFD session.  The use of the BFD echo function and 
      on-demand activation are outside the scope of the MPLS BFD specification.</t>

      <t>The BFD session mechanism requires an additional (external) mechanism to bootstrap 
      and bind the session to a particular LSP or FEC.  LSP Ping is designated by [MPLS BFD] 
      as the bootstrap mechanism for the BFD session in an MPLS environment.  The implication
      is that the session establishment BFD messages for MPLS are transmitted using a 
      IP/UDP encapsulation.</t>
      <t>In order to be able to identify certain extreme cases of mis-connectivity, it is 
      necessary that each managed connection have its own unique identifiers.  BFD uses 
      Discriminator values to identify the connection being verified, at both ends of the path.
      These discriminator values are set by each end-node to be unique only in the context of 
      that node.  This limited scope of uniqueness would not identify a misconnection of crossing 
      paths that use the same discriminators at their end-points.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="PW VCCV">
      <t>PW VCCV provides end-to-end fault detection and diagnostics for PWs 
      (regardless of the underlying tunneling technology). The VCCV switching function 
      provides a control channel associated with each PW (based on the PW Associated 
      Channel Header (ACH) which is defined in [PW-ACH]), and allows sending OAM packets in-band 
      with PW data (using CC Type 1: In-band VCCV)</t>

      <t>VCCV supports the following OAM mechanisms: ICMP Ping, LSP Ping and BFD. 
      ICMP and LSP Ping are IP encapsulated before being sent over the PW ACH.  BFD for 
      VCCV supports two modes of encapsulation - either IP/UDP encapsulated (with IP/UDP 
      header) or PW-ACH encapsulated (with no IP/UDP header) and provides support to 
      signal the AC status. The use of the VCCV control channel provides the context,
      based on the MPLS-PW label, required to bind and bootstrap the BFD session to a 
      particular pseudo wire (FEC), eliminating the need to exchange Discriminator values.</t>
 
      <t>VCCV consists of two components: (1) signaled component to communicate 
      VCCV capabilities as part of VC label, and (2) switching component to cause 
      the PW payload to be treated as a control packet.</t>
	<t> VCCV is not directly dependent upon the presence of a control plane. 
	The VCCV capability negotiation may be performed as part of the PW signaling when LDP is used. 
	In case of manual configuration of the PW, it is the responsibility of the operator 
	to set consistent options at both ends. </t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Architectural requirements and general principles of operation">
      <t />
      <t>[MPLS-TP OAM Requirements] defines a set of requirements on OAM architecture 
      and general principles of operations which are evaluated below:</t>
      
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>[MPLS-TP OAM Requirements] requires that OAM mechanisms in MPLS-TP 
            are independent of the transmission media and of the client service 
            being emulated by the PW. The existing tools comply with this 
            requirement.</t>

            <t>[MPLS-TP OAM Requirements] requires that MPLS-TP OAM MUST be able 
            to operate without IP functionality and without relying on control 
            and/or management planes.  It is required that OAM functionality MUST 
            NOT be dependent on IP routing and forwarding capabilities. The 
            existing tools do not rely on control and/or management plane, however 
            the following should be observed regarding the reliance on IP functionality:</t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>LSP Ping, VCCV Ping, and MPLS BFD makes use of IP header (UDP/IP) 
              and do not comply with the requirement. In the on-demand mode, LSP Ping also 
              uses IP forwarding to reply back to the source router.  This dependence on 
              IP, has further implications concerning the use of LSP Ping as the 
              bootstrap mechanism for BFD for MPLS.</t>

              <t>VCCV BFD supports the use of  PW-ACH encapsulated  BFD sessions 
              for PWs and can comply with the requirement.</t>
            </list>

            <t>[MPLS-TP OAM Requirements] requires that OAM tools for fault 
            management do not rely on user traffic, and the existing MPLS OAM 
            tools already comply with this requirement. </t>

            <t> It is also required that OAM packets and the user traffic are congruent (i.e.
            OAM packets are transmitted in-band) and there is a need to differentiate OAM 
            packets from user-plane ones. </t>

              <list style="symbols">
                <t>For PWs, VCCV provides a control channel that can be associated with each 
                PW which allows sending OAM packets in band of PWs and allow the 
                receiving end-point to intercept, interpret, and process them 
                locally as OAM messages. VCCV defines different VCCV Connectivity 
                Verification Types for MPLS (like ICMP Ping, LSP Ping and IP/UDP 
                encapsulated BFD and PW-ACH encapsulated BFD).</t>

                <t>Currently there is no distinct OAM payload identifier in MPLS 
                shim. BFD and LSP Ping packets for LSPs are carried over UDP/IP 
                and are addressed to the loopback address range. The router at 
                the end-point intercepts, interprets, and processes the packets.</t>
              </list>

            <t>[MPLS-TP OAM Requirements] requires that the MPLS-TP OAM mechanism 
            allows the propagation of AC (Attachment Circuit) failures and their 
            clearance across a MPLS-TP domain</t>
               <list style="symbols">

                 <t>BFD for VCCV supports a mechanism for &quot;Fault detection and 
                 AC/PW Fault status signaling.&quot;  This can be used for both IP/UDP 
                 encapsulated or PW-ACH encapsulated BFD sessions, i.e. by setting 
                 the appropriate VCCV Connectivity Verification Type.This mechanism 
                 could support this requirement.</t>
               </list>

            <t>[MPLS-TP OAM Requirements] defines Maintenance Domain, Maintenance 
            End Points (MEPs) and Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIPs). Means 
            should be defined to provision these entities, both by static 
            configuration (as it is required to operate OAM in the absence of 
            any control plane or dynamic protocols) and by a control plane.</t>

            <t>[MPLS-TP OAM Requirements] requires a single OAM technology and 
            consistent OAM capabilities for LSPs, PWs, MPLS-TP Links, and Tandem Connections. 
            There is currently no mechanism in the IETF to support OAM for Tandem Connections. 
            Also, the existing set of tools defines a different way of operating 
            the OAM functions (e.g. LSP Ping to bootstrap MPLS BFD vs. VCCV).</t>

            <t>[MPLS-TP OAM Requirements] requires allowing OAM packets to be 
            directed to an intermediate node (MIP) of a LSP/PW. Technically, this could be 
            supported by the proper setting of the TTL value.  However, the applicability 
            of such a solution needs to be examined per OAM function. For details, see below.</t>

            <t>[MPLS-TP OAM Requirements] suggests that OAM messages MAY be 
            authenticated. BFD has a support for authentication. Other tools 
            should support this capability as well.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <section title="Architectural and Principles of Operation &ndash; Recommendations and Guidelines">

          <t>Based on the requirements analysis above, the following guidelines 
          should be followed to create an OAM environment that could more fully 
          support the requirements cited:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">

             <t>Extend the PW Associate Channel Header (ACH) to provide a control 
             channel at the path and section levels.  This could then be associated 
             with a MPLS-TP Link, LSP, or a Tandem Connection (TC).   The ACH should then 
             become a common mechanism for PW, LSP, MPLS-TP Link, and Tandem Connection.</t>
             <t>Create a VPCV (Virtual Path Connectivity Verification) definition 
             that would apply the definitions and functionality of VCCV to the 
             MPLS-TP environment for LSP or Tandem Connection.  Need a generalized addressing
             scheme that can also support unique identification of the monitored paths (or 
             connections).</t>
             <t>Create or extend the VCCV definition to define a mechanism that would
             apply the definitions and functionality of VCCV to PW Tandem Connections</t>
             <t>Apply BFD to these new mechanisms using the control channel 
             encapsulation, as defined above &ndash; allowing use of BFD for MPLS-TP 
             independent of IP functionality.</t>
             <t>Define a mechanism to create TCME and allow transmission 
             of the traffic via the Tandem Connection using label stacking.</t>
             <t>Define a mechanism that could be used to address a MIP of a path in a unique 
             way, to support the maintenance functions.  This addressing should be flexible to 
             allow support for different addressing schemes, and would supplement the TTL 
             addressing of intermediate points.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>Creating these extensions/mechanisms would fulfill the following architectural
          requirements, mentioned above:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
             <t>Independence of IP forwarding and routing.</t>
             <t>OAM packets should be transmitted in-band.</t>
             <t>Support a single OAM technology for LSP, PW, MPLS-TP Link, and TC.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>In addition, the following additional requirements can be satisfied:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
             <t>Provide the ability to carry other types of communications (e.g., 
             APS, Management Control Channel (MCC), Signalling Control Channel 
             (SCC)), by defining new types of communication channels for PWs, MPLS-TP Links,
             and LSPs.</t>

             <t>The design of the OAM mechanisms for MPLS-TP MUST allow the 
             ability to support vendor specific and experimental OAM functions.</t>

          </list></t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="MPLS-TP OAM Functions">
        <t>The following sections discuss the required OAM functions that were 
        identified in [MPLS-TP OAM Requirements].</t>

        <t>LSP Ping is not considered a candidate to fulfill the required 
        functionality, due its failure to comply with the basic architectural requirement
        for independence from IP routing and forwarding, as documented in Section 
        2 of this document.  However, usage of LSP Ping, in addition to the MPLS-TP 
        OAM tools, or in MPLS-TP deployments with IP functionality is not 
        precluded.</t>

        <section title="Continuity and Connectivity Verification">
          <t>Continuity and Connectivity Verification (CC-V) are OAM operations
          generally used in tandem, and compliment each other.  Together they are used to 
          detect loss of traffic continuity and misconnections between 
          MEPs and are useful for applications like Fault Management, Performance 
          Monitoring and Protection Switching, etc.  To guarantee that CC-V can identify
          misconnections from cross-connections it is necessary that the tool use 
          network-wide unique identifiers for the path that is being checked in the session.</t>

          <section title="Existing tools">
            <t>BFD defines functionality that can be used to support the pro-active OAM CC-V 
            function when operated in the asynchronous mode.  However, the current definition 
            of basic BFD is dependent on use of LSP Ping to bootstrap the BFD session.  Regarding
            the connectivity functional aspects, basic BFD has a limitation that it uses only 
            locally unique session identifiers.</t> 
            <t>VCCV  can be used to carry BFD packets that are not IP/UDP 
            encapsulated for CC-V on a PW and use the PW label to identify the path.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Gap analysis">
            <t>There is currently no tool that gives coverage for both aspects of CC-V 
            functionality.</t>

            <t>One possible option, is to extend BFD to fill the gaps indicated above.  
            The extension would include:

              <list style="symbols">
                <t>A mechanism should be defined to carry BFD packets over LSP without
                reliance on IP functionality.</t>

                <t>A mechanism should be defined to bootstrap BFD sessions for 
                MPLS that is not dependent on UDP.</t>

                <t>BFD needs to be used in conjunction with &quot;globally&quot; unique 
                identifiers for the path or ME being checked to allow connectivity 
                verfication support.  There are two possibilities, to allow BFD to support 
                this new type of identifier &ndash;
                  <list style="symbols">
                    <t>Change the semantics of the two Discriminator fields that exist in
                    BFD and have each node select the ME unique identifier.  This may have
                    backward compatibility implications.</t>

                    <t>Create a new optional field in the packet carrying the BFD that would 
                    identify the path being checked, in addition to the existing session 
                    identifiers.</t>
                  </list>
                </t>

                <t>Extensions to BFD would be needed to cover P2MP connections.</t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>An additional option would be to create a new tool that would give coverage
            for both aspects of CC-V according to the requirements and the principles of operation
            (see section 2.1).  This option is less preferable.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Recommendations and Guidelines">
            <t>Extend BFD to resolve the gaps, using a new optional field for the unique 
            path identifier.</t> 
            <t>Note that [MP BFD] defines a method for using BFD to provide 
            verification of multipoint or multicast connectivity.</t>

        <section title="Alarm Suppression">
          <t>Alarm Suppression is a function that is used by a server layer MEP 
          to notify a failure condition to its client layer MEP(s) in order to 
          suppress alarms that may be generated by maintenance domains of the 
          client layer as a result of the failure condition in the server layer.
          This function should also have the capability to differentiate an administrative 
          lock from a failure condition at a different execution level.</t>

        <section title="Packet Loss Measurement">
          <t>Packet Loss Measurement is a function that is used to verify the quality of
          the service.  This function indicates the ratio of packets that are not delivered 
          out of all packets that are transmitted by the path source.</t>

          <t>There are two possible ways of determining this measurement &ndash;
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>Using OAM packets, it is possible to compute the statistics based on a 
                series of OAM packets.  This, however, has the disadvantage of being artificial,
                and may not be representative since part of the packet loss may be dependent 
                upon packet sizes.</t>
                <t>Sending delimiting messages for the start and end of a measurement period 
                during which the source and sink of the path count the packets transmitted and 
                received.  After the end delimiter, the ratio would be calculated by the path 
                OAM entity.</t>

            <t>LSP Ping supports a trace route function that could be used but as it does 
            not comply with the requirement for OAM functions to be independent of IP routing and 
            forwarding capabilities. Therefore, it can not be utilized for MPLS-TP</t>

        <section title="Delay Measurement">
          <t>Delay Measurement is a function that is used to measure one-way or 
          two-way delay of a packet transmission between a pair of MEPs. Where:</t>
          <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>One-way packet delay is the time elapsed from the start of 
            transmission of the first bit of the packet by a source node until the 
            reception of the first bit of that packet by the destination node.</t>

            <t>Two-way packet delay is the time elapsed from the start of transmission 
            of the first bit of the packet by a source node until the reception of 
            the last bit of the loop-backed packet by the same source node, when
