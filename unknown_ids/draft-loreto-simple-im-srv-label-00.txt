Abstract

   This document registers with the IANA a new Instant Messaging SRV
   Protocol Label registry for SIP/SIMPLE protocol as specified in
   Address Resolution for Instant Messaging and Presence.  This SRV
   Protocol Label indicates SIP/SIMPLE protocol as a protocol that will
   be used to instantiate the instant messaging or presence operations.

Internet-Draft      IANA IM SRV label for SIP/SIMPLE            Jan 2008


1.  Introduction

   Address Resolution for Instant Messaging and Presence [RFC3861]
   provides guidance for locating the resources associated with URIs
   that employ two Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986]: 'im' for
   INSTANT INBOXes [RFC3860] and 'pres' for PRESENTITIES [RFC3859].

   In order to ensure that the association between "_im" and "_pres" and
   their respective underlying services are deterministic, the IANA has
   created two independent registries: the Instant Messaging SRV
   Protocol Label registry and the Presence SRV Protocol Label registry.

   This document defines and registers the "_sip" protocol label in both
   the registries so that computer programs can resolve 'im:' and
   'pres:' URIs down to SIP addresses.

   Moreover this document specifies how the SIP/SIMPLE protocol uses
   SRV.


2.  How SIP/SIMPLE uses SRV

   Section 5 of [RFC3428] states that if a UA is presented with an IM
   URI (e.g."im:fred@example.com") as the address for an instant
   message, it SHOULD resolve it to a SIP URI, and place the resulting
   URI in the Request-URI of the MESSAGE request before sending".

   However if the UA is unable to resolve the IM URI, in order to
   resolve the IM URI into corresponding SIP URI, it SHOULD perform a
   SRV lookup for:

   _im._sip.example.com

   Assuming that the example.com domain offers a SIP/SIMPLE service at
   simple.example.com, this will result in a resolution of
   _im._sip.example.com. to simple.example.com.  Thus the instant
   messaging URI im:fred@example.com would resolve to a SIP URI of
   sip:fred@simple.example.com.

   The same procedure, with the "_pres" Service label, is used for
   resolve PRES URIs into corresponding SIP Presence [RFC3265].


3.  Security Considerations

   Detailed security considerations for instant messaging and presence
   protocols are given in [RFC2779], for SIP-based presence in [RFC3265]
   and for SIP-based instant messaging in [RFC3428],[RFC3856].

   The DNS procedures in this document introduce no security
   considerations beyond those described in the documents referenced
   above.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers a new SRV Protocol Label in both the
   Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label registry and the Presence SRV
   Protocol Label registry.

4.1.  Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label Registration

   Address Resolution for Instant Messaging and Presence[RFC3861]
   defines an Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label registry for
   protocols that can provide services that conform to the "_im" SRV
   Service label.  Because SIP/SIMPLE is one such protocol, the IANA
   registers the "_sip" protocol label in the appropriate registry, as
   follows:

   Protocol label:  _sip
   Specification:  RFCXXXX
   Description:  Instant messaging protocol label for the SIP/SIMPLE
      protocol as defined by [RFC3428].
   Registrant Contact:  Salvatore Loreto <salvatore.loreto@ericsson.com>

4.2.  Presence SRV Protocol Label Registration

   Address Resolution for Instant Messaging and Presence [RFC3861]
   defines a Presence SRV Protocol Label registry for protocols that can
   provide services that conform to the "_pres" SRV Service label.
   Because SIP/SIMPLE is one such protocol, the IANA registers the
   "_sip" protocol label in the appropriate registry, as follows:

   Protocol label:  _sip
   Specification:  RFCXXXX
   Description:  Presence protocol label for the SIP/SIMPLE protocol as
      defined by [RFC3856].
   Registrant Contact:  Salvatore Loreto <salvatore.loreto@ericsson.com>

   Note to RFC editor: Please replace RFCXXXX with the RFC number
   assigned to this document.


5.  Acknowledgments

   The need for this registration was discussed with Jon Peterson and
   Peter Saint-Andre.
