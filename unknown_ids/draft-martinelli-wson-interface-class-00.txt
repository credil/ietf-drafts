                      WSON Optical Interface Class
                draft-martinelli-wson-interface-class-00

Abstract

   Current work on wavelength switched optical network includes several
   considerations regarding the interface signal compatibility.  In
   particular ingress and egress optical interfaces will require a check
   on several optical parameters to assess if the signal generated by
   the ingress interface can be compatible with the receiving interface.
   Current solution available encode all parameters in WSON protocol
   extensions while in this draft will propose an alternative method to
   keep into account the signal compatibility issue at protocol level.

Internet-Draft        WSON Optical Interface Class             July 2011


1.  Introduction

   The current work on Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON) define
   the need of assessing the signal compatibility during the routing and
   wavelength assignment (RWA) process.  In details, the [RFC6163]
   reports the ingress and egress interfaces and the regeneration points
   as places where the optical signal compatibility must be assured.
   Regarding how to evaluate, there are a list of parameters identified
   according to ITU specification [ITU-G.698.1] and [ITU-G.698.2].  In
   particular the following set of parameters has been chosen: signal
   bit rate, modulation format, forward error correction.

   At the current state of art new high bit rates (40G/100G) are under
   development as well as new modulation formats and it is not clear if
   and when there will be a dominating technology.  In a current
   realistic scenario DWDM optical networks manage different bit-rates
   as well as different modulation formats over the same link.  So in
   general different signal characteristics will coexist at the same
   time.

   To a further extent, the WSON activity will consider the case where
   the control plane has optical impairments awareness as detailed in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-wson-impairments].  The Control Plane function
   related to impairment awareness might require some additional
   interface parameters to assess the optical feasibility path.  In such
   a case is likely further protocol extensions might be required just
   to add some parameters.

   Scope of this draft is to propose an Optical Interface Class
   identifier as a solution for the WSON signal compatibility problem.
   To some extend the idea is have protocol extensions independent from
   optical technology evolution by keeping the semantic of optical
   characteristics separated from protocol scope.  The final goal is a
   simplified but general representation rather than encoding saving.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Existing WSON Signal Compatibility protocol extension

   Within the current WSON activity the signal compatibility encoding is
   defined within the [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rwa-wson-encode].  In details, the
   following list of parameters is considered:

   o  Modulation Format.  Only NRZ currently defined.

   o  FEC, according to G.709 and G.975.

   o  Bit Rate.

   Note that this list of parameters is defined by ITU and might be
   subject to change due to internal physics.

   The above encoding is going to be used within several WSON specific
   protocol extensions.

   o  OSPF [I-D.ietf-ccamp-wson-signal-compatibility-ospf] since the
      path computation function need to consider optical interface
      parameters during the RWA process.

   o  RSVP [I-D.ietf-ccamp-wson-signaling] since during the signaling
      phase there is the need to know optical ingress and egress
      interface properties (and eventually interfaces at regeneration
      point).

   o  In addition, PCEP extension might need similar parameters as
      envisaged here [I-D.lee-pce-wson-rwa-ext].

   In case of any update from ITU standards regarding optical signals
   and interfaces all the above drafts making use of the same
   information needs an update.


3.  Optical Interface Class

3.1.  Concept and Procedures

   The Optical Interface Class will be a unique number that identify all
   information related to optical characteristic's of such interface.

   In term of RWA process the only operation required to assess the
   endpoint compatibility (interfaces or regeneration points) is to
   check if the two LSP endpoint have the same Class value.  The
   procedure of signal compatibility assessment become just a numbers
   comparison: if two Optical Interface Class are equals the signal
   compatibility constrain is satisfied.

                                 Figure 1

   In case the RWA process will result in a path that need a wavelength
   conversion each interface involved in the wavelength conversion must
   satisfy the Optical Interface Class constrain.  As represented in
   Figure 1, two different Optical Interface Classes are required for
   the given LSPs.

   By using the Optical Interface Class concept every protocol
   extensions supporting WSON does not need to care about DWDM signal
   details and does not need to consider technology specific evolution.
   If a new parameter values are standardized (e.g. new modulation
   formats become standard) the wson protocols and RWA don't need any
   extensions.

   The Optical Interface Class will be used in proper TLVs for different
   WSON protocol extensions .

   In case an optical interface or a regeneration point will support
   multiple capabilities, a list of Interface Classes can be used as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rwa-wson-encode].

4.  Optical Interface Class Semantic

   The semantic of the Optical Interface Class must be defined outside
   the control plane but it must be unique for all control plane
   elements.  In this way the same class value will have the same
   meaning on every network node.  Within this hypothesis, we need to
   solve the problem on how to make any network element aware of the
   semantic behind the Optical Interface Class and make sure it can
   figure out the right value for its interfaces.

   An example of semantic is the "Application Code" within [ITU-G.698.1]
   and [ITU-G.698.2].  The Application Code could be easily represented
   by a number represented by the Optical Interface Class.  This number
   might be used as an index to access a table containing all the values
   associated with a specific interface using mechanisms like Directory
   Services.  Note that each single interface parameter could be
   retrieved through a MIB.  As an example,
   [draft-galimbe-kunze-g698-2-snmp-mib] gives another example on the
   Optical parameter specification includes the OII definition in
   compliance with [ITU-G.698.2] Chapter 5.3.

   Every time a new optical interface is defined or introduced into the
   market, only a MIB update will be required but there will be no
   impact on WSON protocols.

   Note also that the Control Plane may become aware of the Optical
   Interface Class semantic by a various of other ways like the network
   management system or manual provisioning.

   As a matter of fact in current WSON technology, standard and
   proprietary information must co-exist.  The introduction of the
   Optical Interface Class does not change or limit this possibility
   since the class identifier can be a means to access either public or
   vendor specific information.  In term of protocol encoding however,
   this solution has the advantage to limit eventually proprietary
   information in a fixed size field.

Appendix A.  Encoding example

   In this section we try to represent how the encoding will change
   considering the Optical Interface Class.  The main result of the
   Optical interface class will be not encoding saving in term of bytes
   but a simplified support for new optical technologies.
