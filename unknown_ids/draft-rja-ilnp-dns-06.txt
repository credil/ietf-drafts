Internet Draft                  ILNP DNS                     18 AUG 2010


   The Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) was developed
   to explore a possible evolutionary direction for the Internet
   Architecture.  An introduction to ILNP is available in a
   separate document. [ILNP-Intro]

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is the standard way that Internet
   nodes locate information about addresses, mail exchangers, and
   other data relating to remote Internet nodes. [RFC 1034] [RFC
   1035] More recently, the IETF have defined standards-track
   security extensions to the DNS. [RFC 4033] These security
   extensions can be used to authenticate signed DNS data records
   and can also be used to store signed public keys in the DNS.
   Further, the IETF have defined a standards-track approach to
   enable secure dynamic update of DNS records over the
   network. [RFC 3007]

   This document defines several new optional data Resource
   Records.  This note specifies the syntax and other items
   required for independent implementations of these DNS resource
   records.  The reader is assumed to be familiar with the basics
   of DNS, including familiarity with [RFC 1034] [RFC 1035].

1.1 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in RFC 2119. [RFC 2119]

2. NEW RESOURCE RECORDS

   This document specifies several new and closely related DNS data
   Resource Records (RRs).  These new RR types have the mnemonics
   "ID", "L32", "L64", and "LP".  These resource record types are
   associated with a Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), that is
   hereafter called the "owner name".  These are part of work on the
   Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP).  [ILNP-Intro]

2.1 "ID" Resource Record

   An ID record has the following logical components:
        <owner-name>  IN  ID  <preference>   <I>


   An "ID" record has the DNS TYPE of ID and a numeric value of <to
   be assigned by IANA>.  An ID record is a member of the Internet
   ("IN") CLASS in the DNS.  Each ID record is associated with a
   owner name entry in the DNS.

Internet Draft                  ILNP DNS                     18 AUG 2010


   ID records are present only for owner name values that are
   ILNP-capable nodes.  This restriction is important; ILNP-capable
   nodes use the presence of ID records in the DNS to learn that a
   correspondent node is also ILNP-capable.  While erroneous ID
   records in the DNS for an owner name that is not ILNP-capable
   would not prevent communication, such erroneous DNS records could
   increase the delay at the start of an IP communications session.

   Of course, a particular node's owner name might have an ID record
   in the DNS and yet that node might be temporarily disconnected
   from the Internet.

   The Preference field indicates the owner name's relative
   preference for this ID record among other ID records associated
   with this owner-name.  Lower preference values are preferred
   over higher preference values.

   In the above <owner-name> is the owner name string, while <I> is
   an unsigned 64-bit value.  A given owner name may have zero or
   more ID records at a given time.  In normal operation, nodes that
   support the Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) will have
   at least one valid ID record.

     The ID DNS record has the following RDATA format:

       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |               Preference                      |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |                                               |
       |                  ID                           |
       |                                               |
       |                                               |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+


   where:

   Preference     A 16-bit unsigned integer which specifies the
                   preference given to this RR among others at
                   the same owner.  Lower Preference values are
                   preferred over higher Preference values.

   ID              A 64-bit unsigned integer.


   Server and Cache implementations are encouraged to return
   all L32, L64, and LP records associated with the owner name
   as additional data present in the ID record reply, if space

   permits in the DNS reply message.

2.2 "L32" Resource Record

   An "L32" record has the DNS TYPE of "L32" and a numeric value of
   <to be assigned by IANA>.  An L32 record is a member of the
   Internet ("IN") CLASS in the DNS.  Each L32 record is associated
   with an owner name entry in the DNS.  The Preference field
   indicates the owner name's relative preference for this
   particular L32 record among other L32 records for the same
   owner name.

   An L32 record has the following logical components:

        <owner-name>  IN  L32  <preference>   <L>

   In the above, <owner-name> is the owner name, <preference> is an
   unsigned 16-bit value, while <L> is an unsigned 32-bit value that
   names a subnetwork where the owner is directly attached.

   A given owner name might have zero or more L32 values at a given
   time.  An ILNP-capable IPv4 host SHOULD have at least 1 Locator
   (i.e., L32 or LP) DNS resource record while it is connected to
   the Internet.  An ILNP-capable multi-homed IPv4 host normally
   will have multiple Locator values while multi-homed.  An IPv4
   host that is NOT ILNP-capable MUST NOT have an L32 or LP record
   in its DNS entries.  A node that is not currently connected to
   the Internet might not have any L32 values in the DNS associated
   with its <owner-name>.

   A DNS owner name that is naming a subnetwork, rather than naming
   a host, MAY have an L32 record as a wild-card entry, thereby
   applying to entries under that DNS owner name.  This deployment
   scenario probably is most common if the named subnetwork is, was,
   or might become, mobile.

   The Preference field indicates the owner name's relative
   preference for this LP record among other L32, L64, and LP
   records associated with this owner name.  Lower values are
   preferred over higher values.

   The L32 DNS record has the following RDATA format:

       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |               Preference                      |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |                                               |
       |                  L32                          |

       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+


   where:

   Preference     A 16-bit unsigned integer which specifies the
                   preference given to this RR among others at
                   the same owner.  Lower Preference values are
                   preferred over higher Preference values.

   L32             A 32-bit unsigned integer that names a
                   subnetwork.

   As a performance optimisation, to reduce offered DNS query load
   on the server, DNS server implementations are encouraged to
   return all ID records and LP records for the same owner name
   if space permits in the DNS reply message to an L32 query.

2.3 "L64" Resource Record

   An "L64" record has the DNS TYPE of "L64" and a numeric value
   of <to be assigned by IANA>.  An L64 record is a member of the
   Internet ("IN") CLASS in the DNS.  Each L64 record is associated
   with an owner name entry in the DNS.

   An L64 record has the following logical components:
        <owner-name>  IN  L64  <preference>   <L>


   In the above, <owner-name> is the owner name, <preference> is an
   unsigned 16-bit value, while <L> is an unsigned 64-bit value that
   names a subnetwork where <owner-name> is directly attached.

   A given owner name may have zero or more L64 values at a given
   time.  An ILNP-capable multi-homed host connected to the Internet
   will normally have multiple Locator (i.e., L64 or LP) values
   while multi-homed.

   A DNS owner name that is naming a subnetwork, rather than naming
   a host, MAY have an L64 record as a wild-card entry, thereby
   applying to all entries under that DNS owner name.  This
   deployment scenario is most common if the named subnetwork is,
   was, or might become, mobile.

   A DNS owner name that names a single node that is NOT
   ILNP-capable MUST NOT have an L64 record in the DNS.  A node that
   is not currently connected to the Internet commonly might not
   have any L64 or LP values in the DNS associated with its owner

   name.

   The Preference field indicates the owner-name's relative
   preference for this L64 record among other L64 records associated
   with this owner-name.  Lower Preference values are preferred
   over higher Preference values.

   The L64 DNS record has the following RDATA format:

       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |               Preference                      |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |                                               |
       |                  L64                          |
       |                                               |
       |                                               |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+


   where:

   Preference     A 16-bit unsigned integer which specifies the
                   preference given to this RR among others at
                   the same owner.  Lower Preference values are
                   preferred over higher Preference values.

   L64             A 64-bit unsigned integer that names a
                   subnetwork.

   The Preference field indicates the owner name's relative
   preference for this LP record among other L32, L64, and LP
   records associated with this owner name.  Lower values are
   preferred over higher values.

   As a performance optimisation, to reduce the offered DNS query
   load upon the server, DNS servers are encouraged to return also
   all ID and LP records that belong to the owner name as Additional
   Data in the DNS reply message to the L64 query, if space permits.

2.4 "LP" Resource Record

   As described in [ILNP-Intro], the LP resource record provides
   one level of indirection within the DNS in naming a Locator
   value.  This is useful in several deployment scenarios, such as
   for a multi-homed site where the multi-homing is handled entirely
   by the site's border routers (e.g. via Locator rewriting)
   or in some mobile network deployment scenarios.

Internet Draft                  ILNP DNS                     18 AUG 2010


   An "LP" record has the following logical components:
        <owner-name>  IN  LP  <preference>   <target-name>


   An LP record has the DNS TYPE of LP and a numeric value of <to be
   assigned by IANA>.  An LP record is a member of the Internet
   ("IN") CLASS in the DNS.  Each LP record is associated with an
   owner name entry in the DNS, and points to a second
   Fully-Qualified Domain Name (shown above as <target-name>).

   LP records MUST NOT be present for owner name values that are not
   ILNP-capable nodes.  This restriction is important; ILNP-capable
   nodes use the presence of "LP" records in the DNS to infer that
   a correspondent node is also ILNP-capable.  While erroneous "LP"
   records in the DNS for an owner name would not prevent
   communication, presence of such erroneous DNS records could
   increase the delay at the start of a communications session.

   Of course, a particular node might have an LP record in the
   DNS and yet temporarily be disconnected from the Internet.

   In the above <owner-name> is the owner name, while <target-name>
   is any other valid domain name string.  It is invalid to have
   an LP record with the same value in both the <owner-name> and
   <target-name> values.  A given owner name will have zero or
   more LP records at a given time.

     The LP DNS record has the following RDATA format:

       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |               Preference                      |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |                                               |
       /                  FQDN                         /
       /                                               /
       |                                               |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+


   where:

   Preference     A 16-bit unsigned integer which specifies the
                   preference given to this RR among others at
                   the same owner.  Lower Preference values are
                   preferred over higher Preference values.

                   or more L64 records in the DNS.  This is

             referred to as the <target-name> above.

   The Preference field indicates the owner name's relative
   preference for this LP record among other L32, L64, and LP
   records associated with this owner name.  Lower values are
   preferred.

3. USAGE EXAMPLE

   Given a domain name, one can use the Domain Name System (DNS)
   to discover the set of ID records, the set of L32 records,
   the set of L64 records, and the set of LP records that are
    associated with that owner name.

   As these DNS records are only used with the Identifier-Locator
   Network Protocol (ILNP), these records MUST NOT be present
   for a node that does not support ILNP.  This lookup process
   is considered to be in the "forward" direction.

   The Preference fields associated with the ID, L32, L64,
   and LP records are used to indicate the owner name's preference
   for others to use one particular ID, L32, L64, or LP record,
   rather than use another ID, L32, L64, or LP record also
   associated with that owner-name.  Lower Preference field
   values are preferred over higher Preference field values.

   In the event that a client querying for one of these record
   type does not receive all ID, L32, L64, and LP RR's in a
   response, the client SHOULD send follow-up DNS queries for
   RRTYPE that was missing and is desired, to insure that the
   client receives all the necessary information.  Credible
   anecdotal reports indicate at least one DNS recursive cache
   implementation actively drops Additional Data records that
   were not expected by that DNS recursive cache.  So even if
   the authoritative DNS server includes all the relevant records
   in the Additional Data section of the DNS response, the
   querying client might not receive all of those Additional
   Data records.

   Note that for nodes likely either to be mobile or to be
   multi-homed, the DNS TTL values for L32 and L64 records
   normally will be very low, as those values might change
   frequently.  However, the DNS TTL values for ID and LP records
   normally will be quite long, as those values are not normally
   impacted by node location changes.  Previous trace-driven
   DNS simulations from MIT [SBK2002] and more recent experimental
   DNS validation from U. of St Andrews [Bhatti10] both indicate
   use of very short DNS TTL values is not problematic.

Internet Draft                  ILNP DNS                     18 AUG 2010


   DNS records with lower DNS TTL values potentially can be
   cached for longer periods of time.

4. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

   These new DNS resource record types do not create any new
   vulnerabilities in the Domain Name System.

   Existing mechanisms for DNS security can be used unchanged with
   these record types. [RFC 4033] [RFC 3007] As of this writing,
   those mechanisms are believed to be widely implemented in
   currently available DNS servers.

   In situations where authentication of DNS data is a concern,
   the DNS Security extensions SHOULD be used. [RFC 4033]

   If these DNS records are updated dynamically over the network,
   then the Secure Dynamic DNS Update [RFC 3007] mechanism
   SHOULD be used to secure such transactions.

5. IANA CONSIDERATIONS

   IANA is requested to allocate each of these DNS Resource Records
   (enumerated above in Section 2) a Data RRTYPE value according to
   the procedures of Section 3.1 and 3.1.1 on pages 7 through 9 of
   RFC 5395.  [RFC 5395]

                  DNS RRTYPE PARAMETER ALLOCATION TEMPLATE

      When ready for formal consideration, this template is
      to be submitted to IANA for processing by emailing the
      template to dns-rrtype-applications@ietf.org.

      A.    Submission Date:  To be determined.

      B.    Submission Type:
            [X] New RRTYPE

      C.    Contact Information for submitter:

      D.    Motivation for the new RRTYPE application?

         Support for an experimental set of IP extensions
         that replace the concept of an "IP Address" with
         distinct "Locator" and "Identifier" values.

      E.    Description of the proposed RR type.

            Please see draft-rja-ilnp-dns-02.txt for a full
            description.

      F.    What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that
            need and why are they unsatisfactory?

         The AAAA record combines both Locator and Identifier,
         so has significantly different semantics than having
         separate L64 and ID record values.  The AAAA record also
         lacks scalability and flexibility in the context of the
         experimental protocol extensions that will use the ID
         and L64 records, as any valid ID record value for a node
         can be used on the wire with any valid L64 record value
         for the same node.

         The CNAME record is closest conceptually to an "LP"
         record, but a CNAME is a node name referral scheme,
         while the LP record is indicating that the given node
         has the same routing prefix as some other domain name,
         but does not necessarily have any other values that are

         the same.

      G.    What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

         As described in this draft, "ID", "L64", and "LP".

      H.    Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA
            Registry or require the creation of a new IANA
            sub-registry in DNS Parameters?

         Existing registry of DNS Resource Record (RR) data TYPE
         values should be used.

      I.    Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
            servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being
            processed as an unknown RRTYPE (see [RFC 3597])?

         No.
