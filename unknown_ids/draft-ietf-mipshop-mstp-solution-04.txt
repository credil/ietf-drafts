1.  Introduction

   This document proposes a solution to the issues identified in the
   problem statement document [RFC5164] for the layer 3 transport of
   IEEE 802.21 MIH protocols.

   The MIH Layer 3 transport problem is divided in two main parts: the
   discovery of a node that supports specific Mobility Services (MoS)
   and the transport of the information between a mobile node (MN) and
   the discovered node.  The discovery process is required for the MN to
   obtain the information needed for MIH protocol communication with a
   peer node.  The information includes the transport address (e.g., the
   IP address) of the peer node and the types of MoS provided by the
   peer node.

   This document lists the major MoS deployment scenarios.  It describes
   the solution architecture, including the MSTP reference model and
   MIHF identifiers.  MoS discovery procedures explain how the MN
   discovers MoS both in its home network or while being connected to a
   remote network.  The remainder of this document describes the MIH
   transport architecture, example message flows for several signaling
   scenarios, and security issues.


2.  Terminology

   The following acronyms and terminology are used in this document:

   MIH  Media Independent Handover: the handover support architecture
      defined by the IEEE 802.21 working group that consists of the MIH
      Function (MIHF), MIH Network Entities and MIH protocol messages.

   MIHF  Media Independent Handover Function: a switching function that
      provides handover services including the Event Service (ES),
      Information Service (IS), and Command Service (CS), through
      service access points (SAPs) defined by the IEEE 802.21 working
      group [IEEE80221].

   MIHF User  An entity that uses the MIH SAPs to access MIHF services,
      and which is responsible for initiating and terminating MIH
      signaling.

   MIHFID  Media Independent Handover Function Identifier: an identifier
      required to uniquely identify the MIHF endpoints for delivering
      mobility services (MoS); it is implemented as either a FQDN or
      NAI.

   MoS  Mobility Services: those services, as defined in the MIH problem
      statement document [RFC5164] , which includes the MIH IS, CS, and
      ES services defined by the IEEE 802.21 standard.

   MoSh:  Mobility Services assigned in the mobile node's Home Network

   MoSv:  Mobility Services assigned in the Visited Network, which is
      any network other than the mobile node's home network

      layers of the protocol stack and sends information to the local or
      remote upper or lower layers of the protocol stack.  It can use
      secure or insecure ports to transport information elements (IEs)
      and information about various neighboring nodes.

   ES Event Service: a MoS that originates at a remote MIHF or the lower
      layers of protocol stack and sends information to the local MIHF

      transmission status.

   CS Command Service: a MoS that sends commands from the remote MIHF or
      local upper layers to the local lower layers of the protocol stack
      to switch links or to get link status.

3.  Deployment Scenarios

   This section describes the various possible deployment scenarios for
   the MN and the MoS.  The relative positioning of MN and MoS affects
   MoS discovery as well as the performance of the MIH signaling
   service.

3.1.  Scenario S1: Home Network MoS

   In this scenario, the MN and the services are located in the home
   network.  We refer to this set of services as MoSh as in Figure 1.
   The MoSh can be located at the access network the MN uses to connect
   to the home network, or it can be located elsewhere.

3.2.  Scenario S2: Visited Network MoS

   In this scenario, the MN is in the visited network and mobility
   services are provided by the visited network.  We refer to this as
   MoSv as shown in Figure 2.

3.3.  Scenario S3: Roaming MoS

   In this scenario, the MN is located in the visited network and all
   MIH services are provided by the home network, as shown in Figure 3.

3.4.  Scenario S4: Third party MoS

   In this scenario, the MN is in its home network or in a visited
   network and services are provided by a 3rd party network.  We refer
   to this situation as MoS3 as shown in Figure 4.  (Note that MoS can
   exist both in home and in visited networks).

                     Figure 4: MoS form a third party

   Different types of MoS can be provided independently of other types
   and there is no strict relationship between ES, CS and IS, nor is
   there a requirement that the entities that provide these services
   should be co-located.  However, while IS tends to involve a large
   amounts of static information, ES and CS are dynamic services and
   some relationships between them can be expected, e.g., a handover
   command (CS) could be issued upon reception of a link event (ES).
   Hence, while in theory MoS can be implemented in different locations,
   it is expected that ES and CS will be co-located, whereas IS can be
   co-located with ES/CS or located elsewhere.  Therefore, having the
   flexibility at the MSTP to discover different services in different
   locations is an important feature that can be used to optimize
   handover performance.  MoS discovery is discussed in more detail in
   Section 5.


4.  Solution Overview

   As mentioned in Section 1, the solution space is being divided into
   two functional domains: discovery and transport.  The following
   assumptions have been made:

   o  The solution is aimed at supporting IEEE 802.21 MIH services,
      namely Information Service (IS), Event Service (ES), and Command
      Service (CS).

   o  If the MIHFID is available, FQDN or NAI's realm is used for
      mobility service discovery.

Internet-Draft                    MSFD                          May 2008


   o  The solutions are chosen to cover all possible deployment
      scenarios as described in Section 3.

   o  MoS discovery can be performed during initial network attachment
      or at any time thereafter.

   The MN may know the realm of the MoS to be discovered.  The MN may
   also be pre-configured with the address of the MoS to be used.  In
   case the MN does not know what realm/MoS to query dynamic assignment
   methods are described in Section 5.

   The configuration of the MoS could be executed either upon network
   attachment or after successful IP configuration.  The methodology to
   be used depends on the considered deployment scenario.

   Once the MIHF peer has been discovered, MIH information can be
   exchanged between MIH peers over a transport protocol such as UDP or
   TCP.  The usage of transport protocols is described in Section 6.

4.1.  Architecture

   Figure 5 depicts the MSTP reference model and its components within a
   node.  The topmost layer is the MIHF user.  This set of applications
   consists of one or more MIH clients that are responsible for
   operations such as generating query and response, processing Layer 2
   triggers as part of the ES, and initiating and carrying out handover
   operations as part of the CS.  Beneath the MIHF user is the MIHF
   itself.  This function is responsible for MoS discovery, as well as
   creating, maintaining, modifying, and destroying MIH signaling
   associations with other MIHFs located in MIH peer nodes.  Below the
   MIHF are various transport layer protocols as well as address
   discovery functions.

                            Figure 5: MN stack

   The MIHF relies on the services provided by TCP and UDP for
   transporting MIH messages, and relies on DHCP and DNS for peer
   discovery.  In cases where the peer MIHF IP address is not pre-
   configured, the source MIHF needs to discover it either via DHCP or
   DNS or a combination of both as described in Section 5.  Once the
   peer MIHF is discovered, MIHF must exchange messages with its peer
   over either UDP or TCP.  Specific recommendations regarding the
   choice of transport protocols are provided in Section 6.

   The above reference architecture however does not include other
   services such as message fragmentation and security.  Depending upon
   the MIH service type (e.g., ES, CS and IS) the message size can be
   very large.  In the case where the underlying layers do not support
   fragmentation, this may be an issue.  There are no security features
   currently defined as part of the MIH protocol level.  However,
   security can be provided either at the transport or IP layer where it
   is necessary.  Section 8 provides some guidelines and recommendations
   for security.

4.2.  MIHF Identifiers (FQDN, NAI)

   MIHFID is an identifier required to uniquely identify the MIHF end
   points for delivering the mobility services (MoS).  Thus an MIHF
   identifier needs to be unique within a domain where mobility services
   are provided and independent of the configured IP addresse(s).  An
   MIHFID MUST be represented either in the form of an FQDN [RFC2181] or
   NAI [RFC4282].  An MIHFID can be pre-configured or discovered through
   the discovery methods described in Section 5.


5.  MoS Discovery

   The MoS discovery method depends on whether the MN attempts to
   discover an MoS in the home network, in the visited network, or in a

   3rd party remote network that is neither the home network nor the
   visited network.

   In the case where MoS is provided locally (scenarios S1 and S2) , the
   discovery techniques described in [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dhcp-options]
   and [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dns-discovery] are both applicable and
   either one MAY be used to discover the MoS.

   In the case where MoS is provided in the home network while the MN is
   in the visited network (scenario S3), the DNS based discovery
   described in [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dns-discovery] is applicable,
   while the DHCP based discovery method would require an interaction
   between the DHCP and the AAA infrastructure, similarly to what is
   specified in [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-integrated-dhc] .  This
   latter case assumes that MoS assignment is performed during access
   authentication and authorization.

   In the case where MoS is provided by a third party network which is
   different from the current visited network (scenario S4), only the
   DNS based discovery method described in
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dns-discovery] is applicable.

   It should be noted that authorization of a MN to use a specific MoS
   server is not in scope of this document and is specified in
   [IEEE80221] .  Only in scenario S3 MoS discovery/assignment is
   performed during network access.

5.1.  MoS Discovery when MN and MoSh are in the home network (Scenario
      S1)

   To discover an MoS in the home network, the MN SHOULD use the DNS
   based MoS discovery method described in
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dns-discovery].  In order to use that
   mechanism, the MN MUST first find out the domain name of its home
   network.  Home domains are usually pre-configured in the MNs (i.e.
   subscription is tied to a network), thus the MN can simply read its
   configuration data to find out the home domain name (scenario S1).
   The DNS query option is shown in Figure 6a.  Alternatively, the MN
   MAY use the DHCP options for MoS
   discovery[I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dhcp-options] as shown inFigure 6b.

5.2.  MoS Discovery when MN is in visited network and MoSv is also in
      visited network (Scenario S2)

   To discover an MoS in the visited network, the MN SHOULD attempt to
   use the DHCP options for MoS discovery
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dhcp-options] as shown in Figure 7a.  If the
   DHCP method fails, the MN SHOULD attempt to use the DNS based MoS
   discovery method described in [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dns-discovery] as
   shown in Figure 7b.  In order to use that, the MN MUST first learn
   the domain name of the local network.  There are a number of ways how
   the domain name of a network can be learned:

   DHCP --  In order to find out the domain name of the local network,
      the MN SHOULD use the dhcpv4 option 15 for learning the domain
      name [RFC2132].  A similar solution is available for dhcpv6
      [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-opt-dnsdomain] .

   Reverse dns query --  When DHCP does not provide the required domain
      name, the MN MAY use reverse DNS (DNS PTR record) to find the
      domain name associated with the IP address it is using in the
      visited network.  Note, that when a NAT device exists between the
      MN and the visited network, the MN will first need to find out the
      external IP address of the NAT device.  Some possible methods for
      determining the NAT's external IP address are STUN [RFC3849] or
      UPnP [UPnP_IDG_DCP].  Once the MN has determined the external IP
      address of the NAT device, it MUST use that address in the reverse

         Figure 7: Discovery (a) using DHCP option, (b) Using DNS

   A MN SHOULD always try DHCP first.  In the case where a network has
   MoS(s) deployed but no DHCP mechanisms to discover these servers,
   DHCP query from the MN will fail.  The MN SHOULD then perform a DNS
   lookup after acquiring the domain name of the local network.

   When the discovery of an MoS at the visited network, using the FQDN
   returned in the reverse DNS query, is not successful, the MN MAY
   attempt to remove portions from the left side of the FQDN and attempt
   discovery again.  The process MAY be repeated iteratively until a
   successful discovery.

5.3.  MOS Discovery when the MN is in a visited Network and Services are
      at the Home network (Scenario S3)

   To discover an MoS in the visited network when MIH services are
   provided by the home network, both the DNS based discovery method
   described in [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dns-discovery] and the DHCP based
   discovery method described in [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dhcp-options] are
   applicable.

   To discover the MoS at home while in a visited network using DNS, the
   MN SHOULD use the procedures described in Section 5.1

   Alternatively, the MN MAY also use the DHCP based discovery method.

   Using the DHCP based discovery may be required in deployments where
   the usage of MoS located in the home network is enforced and included
   in the subscription profile.  Similar to
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-integrated-dhc] in this integrated
   scenario the mobile node is required to perform network access
   authentication before it can obtain the MoS information.  This allows
   for MoS discovery at the time of access authentication.  Also, the
   mechanism defined in this document requires the NAS to support MIH
   specific AAA attributes and a collocated DHCP relay agent.  How the
   MoS information is delivered to the NAS is out of scope of this
   document.  One mechanism for this would be to use Diameter extensions
   to deliver the MoS information to the NAS when the mobile node
   performs access authentication with the NAS as described in
   [I-D.stupar-dime-mos-options].

   In these deployment scenarios the AAAh sends the MoS address at home
   to the AAAv during the network access authentication.  The relation
   beween functional components supporting such procedure is shown in
   Figure 8.

   The mobile node executes the network access authentication procedure
   (e.g., IEEE 802.11i/802.1X) and it interacts with the NAS.  The NAS
   is in the visited and it interacts with AAAh via AAAv to authenticate
   the mobile node.  Optionally, in the process of authorizing the
   mobile node, the AAAh could verify in the AAA profile that the mobile
   node is allowed to use MoS services.  The AAAh assigns the MoS in the
   home and returns this information to the NAS.  The NAS may keep the
   received information for a configurable duration or it may keep the
   information for as long as the MN is connected to the NAS.

   The mobile node sends a DHCPv6 Information Request message [RFC3315]
   to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.  In this
   message the mobile node (DHCP client) MUST include the Option Code
   for MoS Identifier Option [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dhcp-options] in the
   OPTION_ORO.  The mobile node MUST also include the OPTION_CLIENTID to
   identify itself to the DHCP server.

   The Relay Agent intercepts the Information-request from the mobile
   node and forwards it to the DHCP server.  The Relay Agent also
   includes the received MoS information from the AAAh in the IPv6 Relay
   Agent MoS Option [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dhcp-options].  If a NAS
   implementation does not store the received information as long as the
   MN's session remains in the visited network, and if the MN delays
   sending DHCP request, the NAS/DHCP relay does not include the IPv6
   Relay Agent MoS Option in the Relay Forward message.

   The DHCP server identifies the client by looking at the DUID for the
   client in the OPTION_CLIENTID.  The DHCP server determines that the

Internet-Draft                    MSFD                          May 2008


   MoS is allocated by the AAAh by looking at the IPv6 Relay Agent Sub-
   Option in the IPv6 Relay Agent MoS Option.  The DHCP server extracts
   the allocated MoS information from the IPv6 Relay Agent Sub-Option
   and includes it in the MoS Information Option
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dhcp-options] in the Reply Message.  If the
   requested information is not available in the DHCP server, it follows
   the behavior described in [RFC3315].

   The Relay Agent relays the Reply Message from the DHCP server to the
   mobile node.  At this point, the mobile node has the MoS information
   that it requested.

   In should be noted, that using the DHCP Options and procedures
   defined in [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dhcp-options] the MN can not specify
   the network (local or home) where it wants the MoS address from.
   Whether the MN receives an MoS address from local or home network
   will depend on the actual network deployment (scenario S2 or S3) and
   operator policy.  In an integrated scenario, where the network access
   authentication is performed by the home network the MoS information
   will be always sent to the AAAv, then stored in the relay agent and
   ultimately sent to the MN if the MN asks for it, using the procedures
   defined in [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dhcp-options].

   This section assumes the use of IPv6 and DHCPv6 based mechanisms to
   discover MoS services in home while the MN is in visited network.  If
   similar functionalities are desired for IPv4 additional DHCPv4
   extensions would be required.  Since use cases requiring these
   extensions were not identified at the time of writing this document,
   they were excluded from the scope of the document.

5.4.  MoS discovery when MIH services are in a 3rd party remote network
      (scenario S4)

   To discover an MoS in a remote network other than home network, the
   MN MUST use the DNS based MoS discovery method described in
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dns-discovery].  The MN MUST first learn the
   domain name of the network containing the MoS it is searching for.
   If the MN does not yet know the domain name of the network, learning
   it may require more than one operation, as DHCP based discovery can

   not be used and pre-configuration is not a feasible solution in case
   of an arbitrary remote network.  The MN MAY attempt to first discover
   an MoS in either the local or home network (as in Figure 9 part (a))
   and query that MoS to find out the domain name of a specific network
   or the domain name of a network at a specific location (as in
   Figure 9 part (b)).  Alternatively, the MN MAY query an MoS
   previously known to learn the domain name of the desired network
   (e.g., via an IS Query).  Finally, the MN MUST use DNS queries to
   find MoS in the remote network as inFigure 9 part(c).  It should be
   noted that step c can only be performed upon obtaining the domain
   name of the remote network.

6.  MIH Transport Options

   Once the Mobility Services have been discovered, MIH peers MAY
   exchange information over TCP, UDP or any other transport supported
   by both the server and client.  The client MAY use the DNS discovery

   mechanism to discover which transport protocols are supported by the
   server in addition to TCP and UDP that are recommended in this
   document.  While either protocol can provide the basic transport
   functionality required, there are performance trade-offs and unique
   characteristics associated with each that need to be considered in
   the context of the MIH services for different network loss and
   congestion conditions.  The objectives of this section are to discuss
   these trade-offs for different MIH settings such as the MIH message
   size and rate, and the retransmission parameters.  In addition,
   factors such as NAT traversal are also discussed.  Given the
   reliability requirements for the MIH transport, it is assumed in this
   discussion that the MIH ACK mechanism is to be used in conjunction
   with UDP, while it is preferred to avoid using MIH ACKs with TCP
   since TCP includes acknowledgement and retransmission functionality.

6.1.  MIH Message size

   Although the MIH message size varies widely from about 30 bytes (for
   a broadcast capability discovery request) to around 65000 bytes (for
   an IS MIH_Get_Information response primitive), a typical MIH message
   size for the ES/CS service ranges between 50 to 100 bytes
   [IEEE80221].  Thus, considering the effects of the MIH message size
   on the performance of the transport protocol brings us to discussing
   two main issues, related to fragmentation of long messages in the
   context of UDP and the concatenation of short messages in the context
   of TCP.  Since transporting long MIH messages may require
   fragmentation that is not available in UDP, if MIH is using UDP a
   limit MUST be set on the size of the MIH message, unless
   fragmentation functionality is added to the MIH layer or IP layer
   fragmentation is used instead.  In this latter case, the loss of an
   IP fragment leads to the retransmission of an entire MIH message,
   which in turn leads to poor end-to-end delay performance in addition
   to wasted bandwidth.  Additional recommendations in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-guidelines] apply for limiting the size of the
   MIH message when using UDP and assuming IP layer fragmentation.  In
   terms of dealing with short messages, TCP has the capability to
   concatenate very short messages in order to reduce the overall
   bandwidth overhead.  However, this reduced overhead comes at the cost
   of additional delay to complete an MIH transaction, which may not be
   acceptable for CS and ES services.  Note also that TCP is a stream
   oriented protocol and measures data flow in terms of bytes, not
   messages.  Thus it is possible to split messages across multiple TCP
   segments if they are long enough.  Even short messages can be split
   across two segments.  This can also cause unacceptable delays,
   especially if the link quality is severely degraded as is likely to
   happen when the MN is exiting a wireless access coverage area.

6.2.  MIH Message rate

   The frequency of MIH messages varies according to the MIH service
   type.  It is expected that CS/ES message arrive at a rate of one in
   hundreds of milliseconds in order to capture quick changes in the
   environment and/ or process handover commands.  On the other hand, IS
   messages are exchanged mainly every time a new network is visited
   which may be in order of hours or days.  Therefore a burst of either
   short CS/ES messages or long IS message exchanges (in the case where
   multiple MIH nodes request information) may lead to network
   congestion.  While the built-in rate-limiting controls available in
   TCP may be well suited for dealing with these congestion conditions,
   this may result in large transmission delays that may be unacceptable
   for the timely delivery of ES/CS messages.  On the other hand, if UDP
   is used, a rate-limiting effect similar to the one obtained with TCP
   may be obtained by adequately adjusting the parameters of a token
   bucket regulator as defined in the MIH specifications [IEEE80221].
   Recommendations for tocken bucket parameter settings are specific to
   the scenario considered.

6.3.  Retransmission

   For TCP, the retransmission timeout is adjusted according to the
   measured RTT.  However due to the exponential backoff mechanism, the
   delay associated with retransmission timeouts may increase
   significantly with increased packet loss.

   If UDP is being used to carry MIH messages, MIH SHOULD use MIH ACKs.
   An MIH message is retransmitted if its corresponding MIH ACK is not
   received by the generating node within a timeout interval set by the
   MIHF.  This approach does not include an exponential backoff and
   therefore tends to degrade more gracefully than TCP when the packet
   loss rate becomes large, in the sense that the expected delay does
   not increase exponentially.  The number of retransmissions is
   limited, which reduces head-of-line blocking of other MIH messages,
   but this can cause important ES/CS messages to be lost.

6.4.  NAT Traversal

   There are no known issues for NAT traversal when using TCP.  The
   default connection timeout of 24 hours is considered adequate for MIH
   transport purposes.  However, issues with NAT traversal using UDP are
   documented in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-guidelines].  Communication
   failures are experienced when middleboxes destroy the per-flow state
   associated with an application session during periods when the
   application does not exchange any UDP traffic.  Hence, communication
   between the MN and the MoS SHOULD be able to gracefully handle such
   failures and implement mechanisms to re-establish their UDP sessions.

Internet-Draft                    MSFD                          May 2008


   In addition and in order to avoid such failures, MIH messages MAY be
   sent periodically, similarly to keep-alive messages, to attempt to
   refresh middlebox state (e.g.  ES reports could be used for this
   purpose).  As [RFC4787] requires a minimum state timeout of two
   minutes or more, MIH messages using UDP as transport SHOULD be sent
   once every two minutes.

6.5.  General guidelines

   Since ES and CS messages are small in nature and have tight latency
   requirements, UDP in combination with MIH acknowledgement SHOULD be
   used for transporting ES and CS messages.  On the other hand, IS
   messages are more resilient in terms of latency constraints and some
   long IS messages could exceed the MTU of the path to the destination.
   Therefore, TCP SHOULD be used for transporting IS messages.  For both
   UDP and TCP cases, if a port number is not explicitly assigned (e.g.
   by the DNS SRV), MIH messages sent over UDP, TCP or other supported
   transport MUST use the default port number defined for that
   particular transport.

   MoS server MUST support both UDP and TCP for MIH transport and the MN
   MUST support TCP.  Additionally, the server and MN MAY support
   additional transport mechanisms.  The MN MAY use the procedures
   defined in [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dns-discovery] to discover
   additional transport protocols supported by the server.


7.  Operation Flows

   Figure 10 gives an example operation flow between MIHF peers when an
   MIH user requests an IS service.  Scenario 1 is in effect, i.e. the
   MoS and the MN are both in the MN's home network.  Thus DHCP is used
   for MoS discovery and TCP is used for establishing a transport
   connection to carry the IS messages.  When MoS is not pre-configured,
   the MIH user needs to discover the IP address of MoS to communicate
   with the remote MIHF.  Therefore the MIH user sends a discovery
   request message to the local MIHF as defined in [IEEE80221].

   In this example (one could draw similar mechanisms with DHCPv6), we
   assume that MoS discovery is performed before a transport connection
   is established with the remote MIHF, and the DHCP client process is
   invoked via some internal APIs.  DHCP Client sends DHCP INFORM
   message according to standard DHCP and with the MoS option as defined
   in [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mos-dhcp-options].  DHCP server replies via DHCP
   ACK message with the IP address of the MoS.  The MoS address is then
   passed to the MIHF locally via some internal APIs.  MIHF generates
   the discovery response message and passes it on to the corresponding
   MIH user.  The MIH user generates an IS query addressed to the remote

   MoS.  MIHF invokes the underlying TCP client which establishes a
   transport connection with the remote peer.  Once the transport
   connection is established, MIHF sends the IS query via MIH protocol
   REQUEST message.  The message and query arrive at the destination
   MIHF and MIH user respectively.  The MoS MIH user responds to the
   corresponding IS query and the MoS MIHF sends the IS response via MIH
   protocol RESPONSE message.  The message arrives at the source MIHF
   which passes the IS response on to the corresponding MIH user.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of security issues that need to be taken into
   account during node discovery and information exchange via a
   transport connection [RFC5164]

   In the case where DHCP is used for node discovery and authentication
   of the source and content of DHCP messages is required, network
   administrators SHOULD use DHCP authentication option described in
   [RFC3118], where available or rely upon link layer security.  This
   will also protect the DHCP server against denial of service attacks
   to.  [RFC3118] provides mechanisms for both entity authentication and
   message authentication.

   In the case where DNS is used for discovering MoS, fake DNS requests
   and responses may cause DoS and the inability of the MN to perform a
   proper handover, respectively.  Where networks are exposed to such



Melia, et al.           Expires November 15, 2008              [Page 22]

Internet-Draft                    MSFD                          May 2008


   DoS, it is RECOMMENDED that DNS service providers use the Domain Name
   System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) as described in [RFC4033].
   Readers may also refer to [RFC4641] to consider the aspects of DNSSEC
   Operational Practices.

   In the case where reliable transport protocol such as TCP is used for
   transport connection between two MIHF peers, TLS [RFC4346] SHOULD be
   used for message confidentiality and data integrity.  In particular,
   TLS is designed for client/server applications and to prevent
   eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.  Readers should also
   follow the recommendations in [RFC4366] that provides generic
   extension mechanisms for the TLS protocol suitable for wireless
   environments.

   In the case where unreliable transport protocol such as UDP is used
   for transport connection between two MIHF peers, DTLS [RFC4347]
   SHOULD be used for message confidentiality and data integrity.  The
   DTLS protocol is based on the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol
   and provides equivalent security guarantees.

   Alternatively, generic IP layer security, such as IPSec [RFC4301] MAY
   be used where neither transport layer security for a specific
   transport is available nor server only authentication is required.
