Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements         November 2008


1.  Problem Statement

   Low-power wireless personal area networks (LoWPANs) are formed by
   devices complying to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard [5].  LoWPAN devices
   are distinguished by their low bandwidth, short range, scarce memory
   capacity, limited processing capability and other attributes of
   inexpensive hardware.  In this document, the characteristics of nodes
   participating in LoWPANs are assumed to be those described in [3].

   IEEE 802.15.4 networks support star and mesh topologies and consist
   of two different device types: reduced-function devices (RFDs) and
   full-function devices (FFDs).  RFDs have the most limited
   capabilities and are intended to perform only simple and basic tasks.
   RFDs may only associate with a single FFD at a time, but FFDs may
   form arbitrary topologies and accomplish more advanced functions,
   such as multi-hop routing.

   However, neither the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the 6LoWPAN format
   specification ("IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4" [4]) specify how mesh
   topologies could be obtained and maintained.  Thus, the 6LoWPAN
   formation and multi-hop routing should be supported by higher layer,
   either 6LoWPAN adaptation layer or IP layer.  In the IETF, a number
   of experimental protocols in IP layer have been developed in many
   working groups.  However, these existing routing protocols may not be
   satisfying for mesh routing in a LoWPAN domain, for the following
   reasons:

   o  6LoWPAN nodes have special types and roles, such as primary
      battery-operated RFDs, battery-operated and mains-powered FFDs,
      possibly various levels of RFDs and FFDs, mains-powered and high-
      performance gateways, data aggregators, etc. 6LoWPAN routing
      protocols should support multiple device types and roles.

   o  The more stringent requirements that apply to 6LoWPANs as opposed
      to higher performance or non-battery-operated networks. 6LoWPAN
      nodes are characterized by small memory sizes, low processing
      power, and are running on very limited power supplied by primary
      non-rechargeable batteries (a few kBytes of RAM, a few dozens of
      KBytes of ROM/flash memory, and a few MHz of CPU is typical).  A
      node's lifetime is usually defined by the lifetime of its battery.

   o  Handling sleeping nodes is very critical in 6LoWPANs, more than in
      traditional ad-hoc networks. 6LoWPAN nodes might stay in sleep-
      mode for most of the time.  Time synchronization is important for
      efficient forwarding of packets.

   o  A possibly simpler routing problem; 6LoWPANs might be either
      transit-networks or stub-networks.  We can focus on stub networks



Kim, et al.                Expires May 7, 2009                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements         November 2008


      first as existing 6LoWPAN documents (implicitly or explicitly)
      show the 6LoWPAN picture under the configuration of stub networks
      at this moment [4], [7].  We can simplify networks by an
      assumption of no transit networks. (based on the necessity, we may
      extend the network configuration including transit network case)

   o  A possibly harder routing problem; routing in 6LoWPANs requires to
      consider power-optimization, harsh environment, data-aware
      routing, etc.  These are not easy requirements to satisfy
      together.

   This creates new challenges on obtaining robust and reliable routing
   within LoWPANs.

   The 6LoWPAN problem statement document ("6LoWPAN Problems and Goals"
   [3]) briefly mentions four requirements on routing protocols;

      (a) low overhead on data packets

      (b) low routing overhead

      (c) minimal memory and computation requirements

      (d) support for sleeping nodes considering battery saving

   These four high-level requirements only describe the need for low
   overhead and power saving.  But, based on the fundamental features of
   LoWPAN, more detailed routing requirements are presented in this
   document, which can lead to further analysis and protocol design.

   Using the 6LoWPAN header format[6], there are two layers routing
   protocols can be defined at, commonly referred to as "mesh-under" and
   "route-over".  The mesh-under approach supports routing under the IP
   link and is directly based on the link-layer IEEE 802.15.4 standard,
   therefore using (64-bit or 16-bit short) MAC addresses.  On the other
   hand, the route-over approach relies on IP routing and therefore
   supports routing over possibly various types of interconnected links
   (see also Figure 1).  Most statements in this document consider both
   the mesh-under and route-over cases.
   [Note] ROLL WG is now working on the protocol survey for Low power
   and Lossy Networks (LLNs), not specifically for 6LoWPAN.  It will
   decide whether new solution will be developed or not, after that
   survey.  This document is focused on 6LoWPAN specific requirements,
   in alignment with ROLL WG.

   Considering the problems above, The detailed 6LoWPAN routing
   requirements must be defined.  Application-specific features affect
   the design of 6lowpan routing requirements and the corresponding

   solutions.  However, various applications can be profiled by similar
   technical characteristics, although the detail requirements differ.
   (e.g., a few dozens nodes for home lighting system needs appropriate
   'scalability' for the applications, while billions of nodes for
   highway infrastructure system also needs appropriate 'scalability'.)
   This document states the routing requirements to consider the
   features of 6LoWPAN applications in general, while trying to give
   example cases for different cases of routing.  It is noted that this
   one routing requirement document does not mean that having a single
   routing solution may be the best one for all 6LoWPAN applications.

2.  Design Space

   Apart from a wide variety of routing algorithms possible for 6LoWPAN,
   the question remains as to whether routing should be performed mesh-
   under (in the adaptation layer defined by the 6lowpan format document
   [4]), or in the IP-layer using a route-over approach.  The most
   significant consequence of mesh-under routing is that routing would
   be directly based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, therefore using (64-
   bit or 16-bit short) MAC addresses instead of IP addresses, and a
   LoWPAN would be seen as a single IP link.  In case a route-over
   mechanism is to be applied to a LoWPAN it must also support 6LoWPAN's
   unique properties using global IPv6 addressing.  One radio hop would
   be seen as a single IP link [7].

   Figure 1 shows the place of 6LoWPAN routing in the entire network
   stack;

        Figure 1: Mesh-under (left) and route-over routing (right)

   In order to avoid packet fragmentation and the overhead for
   reassembly, routing packets should fit into a single IEEE 802.15.4
   physical frame and application data should not be expanded to an
   extent that they no longer fit.

   If a mesh-under routing protocol is built for operation in 6LoWPAN's
   adaptation layer, routing control packets are placed after the
   6LoWPAN Dispatch, unless a new code type is assigned for mesh-under
   routing.  Multiple routing protocols can be supported by the usage of
   different Dispatch bit sequences.  In a specific use-case can use
   mesh-header in [4]for pre-defined L2 forwarding.  When a route-over
   protocol is built in the IPv6 layer, the Dispatch value can be chosen
   as one of the Dispatch patterns for 6LoWPAN compressed or

   uncompressed IPv6, followed by the IPv6 header.

   If a 6LoWPAN is formed like the Figure 2 , the PnC is the only IPv6
   router in the LoWPAN in the assumption of [4].  The mesh-under
   routing mechanism MUST be provided to forward packets which require
   multi-hop forwarding.

   If route-over routing is used in the stub-network, not only the PnC
   but also other intermediate nodes become LoWPAN router and set up
   IPv6 paths for multi-hop transmission.

   If multiple 6LoPWANs are formed with globally unique IPv6 addresses
   in the 6LoWPANs, and node (a) of 6LoWPAN [A] wants to communicate
   with node (b) of 6LoWPAN [B], the PnC (= IPv6 router at the edge of
   the LoWPAN) will be always the default router for the outgoing packet
   of the 6LoWPAN.

3.  Scenario Considerations and Parameters for 6LoWPAN Routing

   IP-based low-power WPAN technology is still in its early stage of
   development, but the range of conceivable usage scenarios is
   tremendous.  The numerous possible applications of sensor networks
   make it obvious that mesh topologies will be prevalent in LoWPAN
   environments and routing will be a necessity for expedient
   communication.  Research efforts in the area of sensor networking
   have put forth a large variety of multi-hop routing algorithms [6].
   Most related work focuses on optimizing routing for specific
   application scenarios, which can largely be categorized into several
   models of communication, including the following ones:

   o  Flooding (in very small networks)

   o  Data-aware routing (dissemination vs. gathering)

   o  Event-driven vs. query-based routing

   o  Geographic routing

   o  Probabilistic routing

   o  Hierarchical routing

   Depending on the topology of a 6LoWPAN and the application(s) running
   over it, different types of routing may be used.  However, this
   document abstracts from application-specific communication and
   describes general routing requirements valid for overall routing in
   6LoWPANs.

   The following parameters can be used to describe specific scenarios
   in which the candidate routing protocols could be evaluated.

   a.  Network Properties:

       *  Number of Devices, Density and Network Diameter:
          These parameters usually affect the routing state directly
          (e.g. the number of entries in a routing table or neighbor
          list).  Especially in large and dense networks, policies must
          be applied for discarding "low-quality" and stale routing
          entries in order to prevent memory overflow.

       *  Connectivity:
          Due to external factors or programmed disconnections, a
          6LoWPAN can be in several states of connectivity; anything in
          the range from "always connected" to "rarely connected".  This
          poses great challenges to the dynamic discovery of routes



Kim, et al.                Expires May 7, 2009                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements         November 2008


          across a LoWPAN.

       *  Dynamicity (include mobility):
          Location changes can be induced by unpredictable external
          factors or by controlled motion, which may in turn cause route
          changes.  Also, nodes may dynamically be introduced into a
          LoWPAN and removed from it later.  The routing state and the
          volume of control messages is heavily dependent on the number
          of moving nodes in a LoWPAN and their speed.

       *  Deployment:
          In a LoWPAN, it is possible for nodes to be scattered randomly
          or to be deployed in an organized manner.  The deployment can
          occur at once, or as an iterative process, which may also
          affect the routing state.

       *  Spatial Distribution of Nodes and Gateways:
          Network connectivity depends on node spatial distribution
          besides other factors like device number, density and
          transmission range.  For instance, nodes can be placed on a
          grid, or can be randomly placed in an area (bidimensional
          Poisson distribution), etc.  In addition, if the LoWPAN is
          connected to other networks through infrastructure nodes
          called gateways, the number and spatial distribution of
          gateways affects network congestion and available bandwidth,
          among others.

       *  Traffic Patterns, Topology and Applications:
          The design of a LoWPAN and the requirements on its application
          have a big impact on the network topology and the most
          efficient routing type to be used.  For different traffic
          patterns (point-to-point, multipoint-to-point, point-to-
          multipoint) and network architectures, various routing
          mechanisms have been introduced, such as data-aware, event-
          driven, address-centric, and geographic routing.

       *  Quality of Service (QoS):
          For mission-critical applications, support of QoS is mandatory
          in resource-constrained LoWPANs and cannot be achieved without
          a certain degree of routing protocol overhead.

       *  Security:
          LoWPANs may carry sensitive information and require a high
          level of security support where the availability, integrity,
          and confidentiality of data are primordial.  Secured messages
          cause overhead and affect the power consumption of LoWPAN
          routing protocols.

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements         November 2008


   b.  Node Parameters:

       *  Processing Speed and Memory Size:
          These basic parameters define the maximum size of the routing
          state.  LoWPAN nodes may have different performance
          characteristics beyond the common RFD/FFD distinction.

       *  Power Consumption and Power Source:
          The number and topology of battery- and mains-powered nodes in
          a LoWPAN affect routing protocols in their selection of
          optimal paths for network lifetime maximization.

       *  Transmission Range:
          This parameter affects routing.  For example, a high
          transmission range may cause a dense network, which in turn
          results in more direct neighbors of a node, higher
          connectivity and a larger routing state.

       *  Traffic Pattern: This parameter affects routing since high-
          loaded nodes (either because they are the source of packets to
          be transmitted or due to forwarding) may incur a greater
          contribution to delivery delays than low-loaded nodes.  This
          applies to both data packets and routing control messages
          themselves.

   c.  Link Parameters:

       *  Throughput:
          The maximum user data throughput of a bulk data transmission
          between a single sender and a single receiver through an
          unslotted IEEE 802.15.4 2.4 GHz channel in ideal conditions is
          as follows [17]:

          +  16-bit MAC addresses, unreliable mode: 151.6 kbps

          +  16-bit MAC addresses, reliable mode: 139.0 kbps

          +  64-bit MAC addresses, unreliable mode: 135.6 kbps

          +  64-bit MAC addresses, reliable mode: 124.4 kbps

          In the case of 915 MHz band:

          +  16-bit MAC addresses, unreliable mode: 31.1 kbps

          +  16-bit MAC addresses, reliable mode: 28.6 kbps

          +  64-bit MAC addresses, unreliable mode: 13.9 kbps

          +  64-bit MAC addresses, reliable mode: 12.8 kbps

       *  Latency:
          The range of latencies of a frame transmission between a
          single sender and a single receiver through an unslotted IEEE
          802.15.4 2.4 GHz channel in ideal conditions are as follows
          [20]:

          +  16-bit MAC addresses, unreliable mode: [1.92 ms, 6.02 ms]

          +  16-bit MAC addresses, reliable mode: [2.46 ms, 6.56 ms]

          +  64-bit MAC addresses, unreliable mode: [2.75 ms, 6.02 ms]

          +  64-bit MAC addresses, reliable mode: [3.30 ms, 6.56 ms]

          In the case of 915 MHz band:

4.  6LoWPAN Routing Requirements

   This section defines a list of requirements for 6LoWPAN routing.  The
   most important design property unique to low-power networks is that
   6LoWPANs have to support multiple device types and roles, for
   example:

   o  primarily battery-operated host nodes

   o  mains-powered host nodes

   o  possibly various levels of nodes (data aggregators, relayers,
      etc.)

   o  mains-powered, high-performance gateway(s)

   Due to these unique device types and roles 6LoWPANs need to consider
   the following two primary features:

   o  Power conservation: some devices are mains-powered, but most are
      battery-operated and need to last several months to a few years
      with a single AA battery.  Many devices are mains-powered most of
      the time, but still need to function for possibly extended periods
      from batteries (e.g. on a construction site before building power
      is switched on for the first time).

   o  Low performance: tiny devices, small memory sizes, low-performance
      processors, low bandwidth, high loss rates, etc.

   These fundamental features of LoWPANs affect the design of routing
   solutions, so that existing routing specifications should be
   simplified and modified to the smallest extent possible when there
   are appropriate solutions to adapt, otherwise, new solutions should
   be introduced in order to fit the low-power requirements of LoWPANs,
   meeting the following requirements:

4.1.  Support of 6LoWPAN Device Properties

   The general objectives listed in this subsection should be followed
   by 6LoWPAN routing protocols.  The importance of each requirement is
   dependent on what device type the protocol is running on and what the
   role of the device is.  The following requirements are based on
   battery-powered LoWPAN devices.

   [R01] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD have small code size of
   routing protocol stack and require low routing state to fit the
   typical 6LoWPAN node capacity. (e.g., code size considering its
   typical flash memory size, and routing table less than 32 entries)



Kim, et al.                Expires May 7, 2009                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements         November 2008


      A LoWPAN routing protocol solution should consider the limited
      memory size typically starting at 4KB.  RAM size of 6LoWPAN nodes
      often ranges between 2KB and 10KB, and program flash memory
      normally consists of 48KB to 128KB. (e.g., in the current market,
      MICAz has 128KB program flash, 4KB EEPROM, 512KB external flash
      ROM; TIP700CM has 48KB program flash, 10KB RAM, 1MB external flash
      ROM).

      Due to these hardware restrictions, code length should be
      considered to fit within a small memory size; no more than 48KB to
      128KB of flash memory including at least a few tens of KB of
      application code size.  A routing protocol of low complexity helps
      to achieve the goal of reducing power consumption, improves
      robustness, requires lower routing state, is easier to analyze,
      and may be implicitly less prone to security attacks.

      In addition, operation with low routing state (such as routing
      tables and neighbor lists) SHOULD be maintained since some typical
      memory sizes preclude to store state of a large number of nodes.
      For instance, industrial monitoring applications need to support
      at maximum 20 hops [14].  Small networks, can be designed to
      support a smaller number of hops.  It is highly dependent on
      network architecture, but considering the 6LoWPAN device
      properties, there should be at least one mode of operation that
      can function with 32 forwarding entries or less.

   [R02] 6LoWPAN routing protocol control messages SHOULD not create
   fragmentation of physical layer (PHY) frames.

      In order to save energy, routing overhead should be minimized to
      prevent fragmentation of frames on the physical layer (PHY).
      Therefore, 6LoWPAN routing should not cause packets to exceed the
      IEEE 802.15.4 frame size.  This reduces the energy required for
      transmission, avoids unnecessary waste of bandwidth, and prevents
      the need for packet reassembly.  As calculated in RFC4944 [4], the
      maximum size of a 6LoWPAN frame, in order not to cause
      fragmentation on the PHY layer, is 81 octets.

   [R03] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD cause minimal power
   consumption by the efficient use of control packets (e.g., minimize
   expensive multicast which cause broadcast to the entire LoWPAN).

      Routing protocol design for 6LoWPAN should consider IEEE 802.15.4
      link layer feedback on energy consumption.  Power-aware routing is
      a non-trivial task, because it is affected by many mutually
      conflicting goals:

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements         November 2008


      *  Minimization of total energy consumed in the network

      *  Maximization of the time until a network partition occurs

      *  Minimizing the energy variance at each node

      *  Minimizing the cost per packet

      while maintaining packet delivery ratio, latency or other
      requirements depending on each application.

      One way of battery lifetime optimization is by achieving a minimal
      control message overhead.  Compared to functions such as in many
      devices, computational operations or taking sensor samples, radio
      communications is by far the dominant factor of power consumption
      [8].  Power consumption of transmission and/or reception depends
      linearly on the length of data units and on the frequency of
      transmission and reception of the data units [11].

      In [9] the energy consumption of two example RF controllers for
      low-power nodes is shown.  The TR1000 radio consumes 21mW on
      transmitting at 0.75mW, and 15mW on reception (with a receiver
      sensitivity of -85dBm).  The CC1000 consumes 31.6mW on
      transmitting 0.75mW, and 20mW for receiving (with a receiver
      sensitivity of -105dBm). [9] explains the power continuation under
      the concept of an idealized power source: based on the energy of
      idealized AA battery, the CC1000 can transmit for approximately 4
      days straight or receive for 9 days straight.

      One multicast packet causes reception of the entire nodes in the
      LoWPAN, while only the nodes in the path use the reception energy
      at unicast.  Thus, 6LoWPAN routing protocol SHOULD minimize the
      control cost by the routing packets.

4.2.  Support of 6LoWPAN Link Properties

   6LoWPAN links have the characteristics of low bandwidth and possibliy
   high loss rates.  The routing requirements described in this
   subsection are from the link properties.

   [R04] The design of routing protocols for 6LoWPANs must consider the
   fact that packets are to be delivered with reasonable probability.

      Latency requirements may differ from a few hundreds milliseconds
      to minutes, depending on the type of application.  Real-time
      building automation applications usually need response times below
      500 ms between ingress and egress, while forced entry securty
      alerts must be routed to one or more fixed or mobile user devices



Kim, et al.                Expires May 7, 2009                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements         November 2008


      within 5 seconds [16].  Non-critical closed loop applications for
      industrial automation have latency requirements that can be as low
      as 100 ms but many control loops are tolerant of latencies above
      1s [14].  In contrast to this, urban monitoring applications allow
      latencies smaller than the typical intervals used for reporting
      sensed information; for instance, in the order of seconds or
      minutes [15].

      The range of latencies of a frame transmission between a single
      sender and a single receiver through an unslotted IEEE 802.15.4
      2.4 GHz channel is between 2.46ms and 6.02ms in 64 bit MAC address
      unreliable mode and 2.20 ms to 6.56ms in 64 bit address reliable
      mode.  The range of latencies of 868 MHz band is from 11.7 ms to
      63.7 ms, different from address types and reliable/unreliable
      mode.

      Considering the 6LoWPAN link latency, routing protocols can
      calculate the probable delivering time of the control packets in a
      normal case not more than a few hundred ms between two nodes.

   [R05] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be robust to dynamic loss
   caused by link failure or device unavailability either in short-term
   (e.g. due to RSSI variation, interference variation, noise and
   asynchrony) or in long-term (e.g. due to a depleted power source,
   hardware breakdown, operating system misbehavior, etc).

      An important trait of 6LoWPAN devices is their unreliability due
      to limited system capabilities, and also because they might be
      closely coupled to the physical world with all its unpredictable
      variation.  In harsh environments, LoWPANs easily suffer from link
      failure.  Collision or link failure easily increases Send Queue/
      Receive Queue (SQ/RQ) and it can lead to queue overflow and packet
      losses.

      For home applications, where users expect feedback after carrying
      out actions (such as handling a remote control while moving
      around), routing protocols must converge within 2 seconds if the
      destination node of the packet has moved [13].  The tolerance of
      the recovery time can vary dependent on the application, however,
      the routing protocol must provide the detection of short-term
      unavailability and long-term disappearance.  The routing protocol
      has to exploit network resources (e.g. path redundancy) to offer
      good network behavior despite of node failure.

4.3.  Support of 6LoWPAN Network Characteristics

   6LoWPAN can be deployed with different tolerance levels, network
   scales, topologies, levels of mobility, etc.  In any case, 6LoWPAN
   must be maintain low energy consumption.  The requirements described
   in the following subsection are derived from the network feature of
   6LoWPANs.

   [R06] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be reliable despite
   unresponsive nodes due to periodic hibernation. (e.g., management
   with the duty cycle)

      Many nodes in 6LoWPAN environments might periodically hibernate
      (i.e. disable their transceiver activity) in order to save energy.
      Therefore, routing protocols must ensure robust packet delivery
      despite nodes frequently shutting off their radio transmission
      interface.  Feedback, for instance from periodic beacons, from the
      lower IEEE 802.15.4 layer may be considered to enhance the power-
      awareness of 6LoWPAN routing protocols.

      In [9] it is explained that CC1000-based nodes must operate at a
      duty cycle of approximately 2% to survive for one year from
      idealized AA battery power source.  For home automation purposes,
      it is suggested that that the devices have to maximize the sleep
      phase with a duty cycle lower than 1% [13], while in building
      automation, batteries must be operational for at least 5 years
      when the sensing devices are transmitting data (e.g. 64 bytes)
      once per minute [16].

      Dependent on the application in use, packet rates differ from
      1/sec to 1/day.  Routing protocols need to know the cycle of the
      packet transmission and utilize the information to calculate
      routing pathes.

   [R07] The metric used by 6LoWPAN routing protocols MAY utilize a
   combination of the inputs provided by the MAC layer and other
   measures to obtain optimal path considering energy balance and link
   quality.

      Simple hop-count-only mechanisms may be inefficient in 6LoWPANs.
      In home, buildings, or infrastructure, some nodes will be
      installed with mains-powered.  Such power-installed node MUST be
      considered as a relay point for more roles in packet delivery.
      6LoWPAN routing protocols MUST know the power source of the nodes.

      There is a Link Quality Indicator (LQI), Link Delivery Ratio
      (LDR), or/and RSSI from IEEE 802.15.4 that may be taken into
      account for better metrics.  The metric to be used (and its goal)



Kim, et al.                Expires May 7, 2009                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements         November 2008


      may depend on application and requirements.

      The numbers in Figure 3 represent the Link Delivery Ratio (LDR)
      between each pair of nodes.  There are studies that show a
      piecewise linear dependence between LQI and LDR [12].


                                     0.6
                                  A-------C

                         Figure 3: An example network

      In this simple example, there are two options in routing from node
      A to node C:

      A.  Path AC:

          +  (1/0.6) = 1.67 avg. transmissions needed for each packet

          +  one-hop path

          +  good in energy consumption, bad in delivery ratio (0.6)

      B.  Path ABC

          +  2*(1/0.81) = 2.47 avg. transmissions needed for each packet

          +  two-hop path

          +  bad in energy consumption, good in delivery ratio (0.81)

      If energy consumption of the network must be minimized, path AC is
      the best (this path would be chosen by hop count metric).
      However, if delivery ratio in that case is not sufficient, best
      path is ABC (it would be chosen by an LQI based metric).
      Combinations of both of metrics can be used.

   [R08] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be designed to achieve both
   scalability from a few nodes to millions of nodes and minimality in
   terms of used system resources.

      A 6LoWPAN may consist of just a couple of nodes (for instance in a
      body-area network), but may expand to much higher numbers of
      devices (e.g. monitoring of a city infrastructure or a highway).

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements         November 2008


      For home automation applications it is envisioned that the routing
      protocol must support 250 devices in the network [13], while
      routing protocols for metropolitan-scale sensor networks must be
      capable of clustering a large number of sensing nodes into regions
      containing on the order of 10^2 to 10^4 sensing nodes each [15].
      It is therefore necessary that routing mechanisms are designed to
      be scalable for operation in various network sizes.  However, due
      to a lack of memory size and computational power, 6LoWPAN routing
      might limit forwarding entries to a small number, such as at
      maximum 32 routing table entries.

   [R09] The procedure of route repair and related control messages
   should not harm overall energy consumption from the routing
   protocols.

      Local repair improves throughput and end-to-end latency,
      especially in large networks.  Since routes are repaired quickly,
      fewer data packets are dropped, and a smaller number of routing
      protocol packet transmissions is needed since routes can be
      repaired without source initiated Route Discovery [10].

   [R10] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD allow for dynamically adaptive
   topologies and mobile nodes.  When supporting dynamic topologies and
   mobile nodes, route maintenance should be managed by keeping in mind
   the goal of a minimal routing state.

      Building monitoring applications, for instance, require that the
      mobile devices SHOULD be capable of unjoining (handing-off) from
      an old network joining onto a new network within 15 seconds [16].
      More interactive applications such as used in home automation
      systems, where users are giving input and expect instant feedback,
      mobility requirements are also stricter and a convergence time
      below 0.5 seconds is commonly required [13].  In industrial
      environments, where mobile equipment such as cranes move around,
      vehicular speeds of up to 35 kmph are required to be supported by
      the routing protocol [14].  Currently, 6LoWPANs are not being used
      for such a fast mobility cases, but dynamic association and
      deassociation MUST be supported in 6LoWPAN.

      There are several challenges that should be addressed by a 6LoWPAN
      routing protocol in order to create robust routing in dynamic
      environments:

      *  Mobile nodes changing their location inside a 6LoWPAN:
         If the nodes' movement pattern is unknown, mobility cannot
         easily be detected or distinguished from the routing protocols.
         Mobile nodes can be treated as nodes that disappear and re-
         appear in another place.  Movement pattern tracking increases



Kim, et al.                Expires May 7, 2009                 [Page 18]

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements         November 2008


         complexity and can be avoided by handling moving nodes using
         reactive route updates.

      *  Movement of a 6LoWPAN with respect to other (inter)connected
         6LoWPANs:
         Within stub networks, more powerful gateway nodes need to be
         configured to handle moving 6LoWPANs.

      *  Nodes permanently joining or leaving the 6LoWPAN:
         In order to ease routing table updates and reduce error control
         messages, it would be helpful if nodes leaving the network
         inform their coordinator about their intention to disassociate.

   [R11] 6LoWPAN routing protocol SHOULD support various traffic
   patterns; point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to-
   point, while avoid excessive multicast traffic (broadcast in Link) in
   6LoWPAN.

      6LoWPANs often have point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-point
      traffic patterns.  Many emerging applications include point-to-
      point communication as well. 6LoWPAN routing protocols should be
      designed with the consideration of forwarding packets from/to
      multiple sources/destinations.  Current WG drafts in the ROLL
      working group explain that the workload or traffic pattern of use
      cases for 6LoWPANs tend to be highly structured, unlike the any-
      to-any data transfers that dominate typical client and server
      workloads.  In many cases, exploiting such structure may simplify
      difficult problems arising from resource constraints or variation
      in connectivity.

4.4.  Support of Security

   The routing requirement described in this subsection allow secure
   transmission of routing messages.  Solutions may take into account
   the specific features of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layers.

   [R12] 6LoWPAN protocols SHOULD support secure delivery of control
   messages.  A minimal security level can be achieved by utilizing AES-
   based mechanism provided by IEEE 802.15.4.

      Security threats within LoWPANs may be different from existing
      threat models in ad-hoc network environments.  Neighbor Discovery
      in IEEE 802.15.4 links may be susceptible to threats as listed in
      RFC3756 [2].  Bootstrapping may also impose additional threats.
      Security is also very important for designing robust routing
      protocols, but it should not cause significant transmission
      overhead.  While there are applications which require very high
      security, such as in traffic control, other applications are less



Kim, et al.                Expires May 7, 2009                 [Page 19]

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements         November 2008


      easily harmed by wrong node behavior, such as a home entertainment
      system.

      The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC provides an AES-based security mechanism.
      Routing protocols need to define how this mechanism can be used to
      obtain the intended security.  Byte overhead of the mechanism,
      which depends on the security services selected, must be
      considered.  In the worst case in terms of overhead, the mechanism
      consumes 21 bytes of MAC payload.

4.5.  Support of Mesh-under Forwarding

   One 6LoWPAN may be built as one IPv6 link.  In this case, mesh-under
   forwarding/routing must be supported.  The routing requirements
   described in this subsection allow optimization and correct operation
   of routing solutions taking into account the specific features mesh-
   under routing.

   [R13] In case a routing protocol operates in 6LoWPAN's adaptation
   layer, then routing tables and neighbor lists MUST support 16-bit
   short and 64-bit extended addresses.

   [R14] For neighbor discovery, 6LoWPAN devices SHOULD avoid sending
   "Hello" messages.  Instead, link-layer mechanisms (such as
   acknowledgments or beacon responses) MAY be utilized to keep track of
   active neighbors.

      After an IEEE 802.15.4 PAN coordinator permits a device to join,
      the new device adds the PAN coordinator to its neighbor list and
      starts transmitting periodic beacons.  These beacons can be used
      as an indication of current neighbors.

   [R15] In case there are one or more alternative PAN coordinators, the
   coordinators MAY take the role of keeping track of node association
   and de-association within the LoWPAN.

   [R16] Alternative PAN coordinators, if any, MAY be a relay point of
   group-targeting message instead of using multicast (broadcast in the
   link layer).

      For example, RS and RA can be only sent to the coordinators,
      instead of being multicast.  The coordinators take the role to
      pass the packets to their own neighbors.
