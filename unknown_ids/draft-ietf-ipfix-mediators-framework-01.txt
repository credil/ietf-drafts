1.  Introduction

   IPFIX Mediation reroutes, replicates, filters, aggregates,
   correlates, or modifies Flow Records/Packet Reports or changes a
   transport protocol.  This document describes the framework for IPFIX
   Mediation.  The motivation for the IPFIX Mediation standard comes
   from the need for flow-based measurement system support for large-
   scale networks, interdomain networks, and coexistence with
   traditional Exporters as described in detail in
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-mediator-ps].  The standard specification requires a
   definition of IPFIX Mediation and IPFIX Mediation device (IPFIX
   Mediator).

   This document is organized as follows.  Section 2 describes
   terminology related to IPFIX Mediation.  Section 3 describes a high
   level reference model.  Section 4 details the components of the IPFIX
   Mediator.

2.  Terminology

   The terms in this section are in line with those in the IPFIX
   specification document [RFC5101] and the PSAMP specification document
   [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol].  Additional terms required for the IPFIX
   Mediation are also defined with those in the IPFIX Mediator problem
   statement [I-D.ietf-ipfix-mediator-ps].  All these terms are
   capitalized in this document.

   Observation Point

      An Observation Point is a location in the network where IP packets
      can be observed.  Examples include: a line to which a probe is
      attached, a shared medium, such as an Ethernet-based LAN, a single
      port of a router, or a set of interfaces (physical or logical) of
      a router.

      Note that every Observation Point is associated with an
      Observation Domain (defined below), and that one Observation Point
      may be a superset of several other Observation Points.  For
      example, one Observation Point can be an entire line card.  That
      would be the superset of the individual Observation Points at the
      line card's interfaces.

   Observation Domain

      An Observation Domain is the largest set of Observation Points for
      which Flow information can be aggregated by a Metering Process.
      For example, a router line card may be an Observation Domain if it
      is composed of several interfaces, each of which is an Observation
      Point.  In the IPFIX Message it generates, the Observation Domain
      includes its Observation Domain ID, which is unique per Exporting
      Process.  That way, the Collecting Process can identify the
      specific Observation Domain from the Exporter that sends the IPFIX
      Messages.  Every Observation Point is associated with an
      Observation Domain.  It is RECOMMENDED that Observation Domain IDs
      also be unique per IPFIX Device.

   Flow Key

      Each of the fields that:

      1. belong to the packet header (e.g., destination IP address),

      2. are a property of the packet itself (e.g., packet length),

      3. are derived from packet treatment (e.g., Autonomous System (AS)
      number),

Internet-Draft          IPFIX Mediation Framework          November 2008


      and that are used to define a Flow are termed Flow Keys.

   Flow Record

      A Flow Record contains information about a specific Flow that was
      observed at an Observation Point.  A Flow Record contains measured
      properties of the Flow (e.g., the total number of bytes for all
      the Flow's packets) and usually characteristic properties of the
      Flow (e.g., source IP address).

   Packet Reports

      Packet Reports comprise a configurable subset of a packet's input
      to the Selection Process, including the Packet Content,
      information relating to its treatment (for example, the output
      interface), and its associated selection state (for example, a
      hash of the Packet Content).

   Exporting Process

      The Exporting Process sends Flow Records to one or more Collecting
      Processes.  The Flow Records are generated by one or more Metering
      Processes.

   Exporter

      A device that hosts one or more Exporting Processes is termed an
      Exporter.

   IPFIX Device

      An IPFIX Device hosts at least one Exporting Process.  It may host
      further Exporting Processes and arbitrary numbers of Observation
      Points and Metering Processes.

   Collecting Process

      A Collecting Process receives Flow Records from one or more
      Exporting Processes.  The Collecting Process might process or
      store received Flow Records, but such actions are out of the scope
      of this document.

   Collector

      A device that hosts one or more Collecting Processes is termed a
      Collector.

Internet-Draft          IPFIX Mediation Framework          November 2008


   IPFIX Message

      An IPFIX Message is a message originating at the Exporting Process
      that carries the IPFIX records of this Exporting Process and whose
      destination is a Collecting Process.  An IPFIX Message is
      encapsulated at the transport layer.

   Information Element

      An Information Element is a protocol and encoding-independent
      description of an attribute that may appear in an IPFIX Record.
      The IPFIX information model [RFC5102] defines the base set of
      Information Elements for IPFIX.  The type associated with an
      Information Element indicates constraints on what it may contain
      and also determines the valid encoding mechanisms for use in
      IPFIX.

   IPFIX Mediation

      An IPFIX Mediation is a generic term for functions doing something
      for Flow Records, Packet Reports, and IPFIX Messages.  IPFIX
      Mediation is located in between components: Metering Processes,
      Exporting Processes, Collecting Processes, and other applications.
      IPFIX Mediation can be included in any IPFIX Devices.  IPFIX
      Mediation consists of a set of some of the following functions:

      *  rerouting input Flow Records/Packet Reports to an appropriate
         Collecting Process

      *  replicating input Flow Records/Packet Reports

      *  filtering and selecting input Flow Records/Packet Reports

      *  aggregating input Flow Records/Packet Reports based on new Flow
         Keys

      *  correlating a set of Flow Records/Packet Reports for creating
         new Flow Records/Packet Reports with new metrics

      *  modifying input Flow Records/Packet Reports

      *  changing transport protocols that carry IPFIX Messages

      The modification of Flow Records/Packet Reports includes these
      processes:

      *  changing the value of specified Information Elements




Kobayashi, et al.          Expires May 8, 2009                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          IPFIX Mediation Framework          November 2008


      *  adding new Information Elements by deriving further Flow or
         packet properties from existing fields or calculating new
         metrics

      *  deleting specified Information Elements.

      IPFIX Mediation can be included in any device, such as routers,
      switches, NMS (Network Management Systems), or stand-alone
      devices.

   Flow-Based Collector Selection

      The Flow-Based Collector Selection evaluates an input Flow Record/
      Packet Report based on the value of the specified Information
      Element and then selects a Collector for each input Flow Record/
      Packet Report.

   IPFIX Mediator

      An IPFIX Mediator contains one or more functions defined in IPFIX
      Mediation.  The IPFIX Mediator can be a stand-alone or a virtual
      device.  It also contains one or more Collecting Processes and one
      or more Exporting Processes.

   Original Exporter

      An Original Exporter is an IPFIX Device that hosts Observation
      Points where IP packets can be directly observed.

   IPFIX Proxy

      An IPFIX Proxy is an IPFIX Mediator that receives IPFIX Messages
      from an Original Exporter and sends IPFIX Messages to one or more
      Collectors.  It may alter part of an IPFIX Message to comply with
      IPFIX Protocol specifications.  It may also change the type of
      transport protocol, such as UDP, TCP, SCTP, and PR-SCTP, and
      convert a legacy protocol message to an IPFIX Message, if
      necessary.

   IPFIX Concentrator

      An IPFIX Concentrator is an IPFIX Mediator that receives Flow
      Records/Packet Reports, aggregates them, then exports the
      aggregated Flow Records.

Internet-Draft          IPFIX Mediation Framework          November 2008


   IPFIX Distributor

      An IPFIX Distributor is an IPFIX Mediator that reroutes input Flow
      Records/Packet Reports based on the result of Flow-Based Collector
      Selection.  It may filter or replicate input Flow Records/Packet
      Reports, if necessary.

   IPFIX Masquerading Proxy

      An IPFIX Masquerading Proxy is an IPFIX Mediator that screens out
      a part of the data of input Flow Records/Packet Reports according
      to configured policies.  It can thus, for example, hide the
      network topology information or customers' IP addresses.

   Intermediate Process

      An Intermediate Process in IPFIX Mediators can be considered as a
      partial Metering Process taken from the Metering Process in
      Original Exporters as described in [RFC3917].

      The Intermediate Process generates new sets of Data Records/Packet
      Reports from input Data Records/Packet Reports.

   Mediator Observation Domain

      An IPFIX Mediator does not host the Observation Points and
      Observation Domain.  The Observation Domain ID in the IPFIX header
      sent by the IPFIX Mediator also indicates the largest set of
      Observation Points from the viewpoint of a Collector.  However,
      this value does not indicate the physical entity of an Original
      Exporter.

   Transport Session Information

      The Transport Session is specified in [RFC5101].  In SCTP, the
      Transport Session Information is the SCTP association.  In TCP and
      UDP, the Transport Session Information corresponds to a 5-tuple
      {Exporter IP address, Collector IP address, Exporter transport
      port, Collector transport port, and transport protocol}.

   The figure below shows the basic IPFIX Mediator component model.  The
   IPFIX Mediator is formally defined to consist of one or more
   Collecting Processes, zero or more Intermediate Processes, and one or
   more Exporting Processes.  Basically, IPFIX Mediator devices, i.e.,
   IPFIX Proxy, IPFIX Masquerading Proxy, IPFIX Distributor, and IPFIX
   Concentrator, described in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-mediator-ps], are composed
   of these components.

4.  IPFIX Mediation Functional and Logical Blocks

   The section describes the details of each component and examples
   applicable to that component for IPFIX Mediation and IPFIX Mediator.

4.1.  Collecting Process

   The Collecting Processes described in [RFC5101] receive Flow Records/
   Packet Reports with information relating to their treatment in the
   Metering Process and Exporting Process in the Original Exporter, such
   as sampling rate, IPFIX header information, and Transport Session
   Information.  The Collecting Processes forward the set of data to
   multiple components: Intermediate Processes and Exporting Processes.
   In other words, the processes may duplicate received Flow Records/
   Packet Reports and forward them to multiple components in sequence or
   in parallel.

4.2.  Exporting Process

   The Exporting Processes described in [RFC5101] forward Flow Records/
   Packet Reports to one or multiple Collectors.  The processes manage
   the reporting Template and make IPFIX Messages.

4.3.  Intermediate Process

   Intermediate Processes generate new sets of Flow Records/Packet
   Reports from input Flow Records/Packet Reports with IPFIX header
   information "Export Time" and "Observation Domain ID".  The processes
   host one of several functions defined below or a combination of them,
   in any sequence or in any set.  In the case of a combination, the
   output of each function can be the input of other functions.  The
   following subsections show the details of each function.

4.3.1.  Flow Selection Function

   The Flow Selection function determines which input Flow Records/
   Packet Reports are selected by matching under a filtering policy and
   then forwards them to the next processes or functions.  The function
   is similar to the Selection Process described in
   [I-D.ietf-psamp-framework].  The function covers several selection
   techniques, such as property match filtering and Flow selection,
   which are described in [I-D.ietf-psamp-framework] and
   [I-D.peluso-flowselection], respectively.  In property match
   filtering, if the value of a specified Information Element equals a
   configured value, the function selects Flow Records/Packet Reports to
   forward.

Internet-Draft          IPFIX Mediation Framework          November 2008


4.3.2.  Flow-based Collector Selection Function

   The Flow-based Collector Selection function determines to which
   Collector input Flow Records/Packet Reports are exported.  The
   function may also determine the type of Transport Session.  The
   function evaluates the value of a specified Information Element in
   input Flow Records/Packet Reports and then selects the Collector.
   These selection criteria are similar to the property match filtering
   in Mediator Selection Function.

   Applicable examples include exporting Flow Records/Packet Reports to
   a dedicated Collector on the basis of customers or organizations
   peering.  The function classifies Flow Records/Packet Reports on the
   basis of a peering AS number, as shown in the following figure.  The
   set of classified Flow Records/Packet Reports is exported to a
   dedicated Collector on the basis of the peering AS number.

4.3.3.  Aggregation Function

   The Aggregation function creates aggregated Flow Records from input
   Flow Records/Packet Reports.  The aggregation method is divided into
   three types:

   Choosing Shorter Flow Key

      Choosing a shorter Flow Key than the Flow Key of input Flow
      Records, such as three, two, or a single Flow Key, can create more
      aggregated Flow Records.  The function gathers Flow Records/Packet
      Reports within a given interval time and then distinguishes Flow
      Records/Packet Reports that have common properties.  If values of
      a given key field are the same, that means those Flow Records/

Internet-Draft          IPFIX Mediation Framework          November 2008


      Packet Reports have common properties, and the function merges
      them in accordance with aggregation rules described in
      [I-D.dressler-ipfix-aggregation].

      In addition, the function can create statistical data and
      subsidiary information related to the aggregated Flow Records.
      Examples include the number of input Flow Records/Packet Reports,
      the given interval time, and a set of a new Flow Key.

   Time Composition

      Time composition is defined as aggregation with the same Flow Key
      for long-running Flows.  The function may also compute Flow
      Records statistics, such as average, maximum, and minimum value of
      each counter.  The statistics help to visualize the behavior of
      traffic volume over a long time period.

      As another approach, the function collects Flow Records/Packet
      Reports of a shorter time period from an Original Exporter, and
      then computes these statistics.  Even if output Flow Records of
      the function indicate a general time period, the accuracy of the
      minimum, maximum, and average value can be improved.

   Space Composition

      Space composition is defined as aggregation on a larger
      Observation Domain or on a set of Observation Points.  In that
      case, a Flow key can be applied to other properties, such as
      Exporter IP address and Observation Domain ID.

      In addition, a group identifier indicating a spatial Observation
      Domain can also become a new Flow Key. For example, a group can
      indicate an area on an ISP network, or a link aggregation
      interface composd of physical interfaces.  The group can also make
      a relation to a set of values of specified Information Elements in
      Flow Records by the configuring rule.  After converting from the
      values of specified Information Elements to the group identifier,
      the function can create aggregated Flow Records by a general
      aggregation process.

4.3.4.  Correlation Function

   The Correlation function creates new metrics from by evaluating the
   correlation among sets of Flow Records/Packets Records.  These sets
   can be Flow Records gathered during a certain period, a pair of
   consecutive Packet Reports, or Packet Reports exported by different
   Exporters indicating the same packet.  After offering new metrics,
   the function outputs Flow Records with the new metrics field.

Internet-Draft          IPFIX Mediation Framework          November 2008


   Applicable examples are as follows.

   o  One way delay follows from correlating Packet Reports exported
      from different Exporters on the path.

   o  Packet interval time, or jitter, follows from correlating
      consecutive Packet Reports exported from the same Exporter.

   o  Difference values follow from correlating Flow Records observed at
      ingress or egress interfaces.  The values help to confirm the
      result of a queueing or rate-limiting function.

   o  Average/maximum/minimum values follow from correlating each in a
      set of Flow Records.

4.3.5.  Modification Function

   The Modification function modifies input Flow Records/Packet Reports
   without changing their granularity.  The function can add new
   Information Elements, delete existing Information Elements, or modify
   the value of specified Information Elements.  If the function
   modifies the data structure of an original Template, it also needs to
   modify the value of the "flowKeyIndicator".

   Adding specified Information Elements

      The function obtains the value of a specified Information Element
      and then adds it into Flow Records/Packet Reports.  There are
      several methods to obtain the value: retrieving the value from a
      database or calculating the value based on the value of other
      Information Elements and received traffic data.

      Applicable examples include adding derived packet property
      parameters instead of Original Exporters.  Doing that can
      compensate for traditional Exporters or probes unable to add
      packet property parameters.  Therefore, Collectors do not need to
      recognize the difference among implementations of routers from
      several vendors or among Exporter types, such as router, switch,
      or probe.  Typical derived packet property parameters include the
      following.

      *  The "bgpNextHop{IPv4|IPv6}Address" described in [RFC5102]
         indicates the egress router of a network domain.  That is
         useful for making a traffic matrix that covers the whole
         network domain.

      *  The BGP Community value indicates the same group of destination
         or source IP addresses.

Internet-Draft          IPFIX Mediation Framework          November 2008


      *  The "mplsVpnRouteDistinguisher" described in [RFC5102], which
         cannot be extracted from the core router in MPLS networks,
         indicates the VPN customer's identification.  Network operators
         can monitor the traffic behavior of each customer by adding
         "mplsVpnRouteDistinguisher" to Flow Records/Packet Reports.

   Deleting specified Information Elements

      This function deletes existing Information Elements according to
      instruction rules, which indicate whether an Information Element
      should be removed.

      Applicable examples include hiding network topology information
      and private information.  In the case of IPFIX exporting across
      domains, the function can avoid making a vulnerability by deleting
      unnecessary Information Elements.  Examples of network topology
      information include "ipNextHopIP{v4|v6}Address", "bgpNextHopIP{v4|
      v6}Address", and "bgp{Next|Prev}AdjacentAsNumber", described in
      [RFC5102].  In addition, MPLS-related Information Elements, such
      as "mplsLabelStackSection", are useless for customers in the case
      of feeding Flow Records/Packet Reports to VPN customers.

   Modifying the value of specified Information Elements

      This function modifies the value of specified Information
      Elements.

      Applicable examples include anonymizing customers' private
      information, such as IP address and port number, according to a
      privacy protection policy.  Several annonymization techniques are
      described in [I-D.boschi-ipfix-anon].  The function also reports
      anonymization methods and part of anonymized data as subsidiary
      information.

4.4.  IPFIX File Writer/Reader

   The IPFIX File Writer stores input Flow Records/Packet Reports from
   any process in a storage system.  If received Flow Records/Packet
   Reports include uninteresting Information Elements, the Modification
   Function can delete these elements before the IPFIX File Writer
   handles them.  Therefore, IPFIX File Writers can accept input from
   any process.  In either case, input needs to include the IPFIX header
   information and the Transport Session Information along with Flow
   Records/Packet Reports.

   In contrast, the IPFIX File Reader retrieves stored Flow Records/
   Packet Reports when operators want to retrieve past Flow Records/
   Packet Reports on the basis of a given time period.  If the data

Internet-Draft          IPFIX Mediation Framework          November 2008


   structure of output Flow Records/Packet Reports from the IPFIX File
   Reader is different from what operators want, the Modification
   function can modify the data structure.  Therefore, the output of
   IPFIX File Readers can be input to any components.  The IPFIX File
   Writer/Reader are described in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-file] in detail.

   The figure shows the IPFIX component model with IPFIX File Writer/
   Reader.  IPFIX File Writer/Reader are located in the same position of
   Exporting Process/Collecting Process, respectively.

   Reader.

4.5.  Flow Expiration

   The Aggregation function needs expiration conditions to export cached
   Flow Records.  These conditions are described in
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture].  In the case of IPFIX Mediation, these
   conditions are as follows:

   o  If there are no input/received Flow Records/Packet Reports
      belonging to a cached Flow for a certain time period, aggregated
      Flow Records will expire.  This time period should be configurable
      at the Intermediate Process.

   o  If the IPFIX Mediator experiences resource constraints, aggregated
      Flow Records may prematurely expire (e.g., lack of memory to store



Kobayashi, et al.          Expires May 8, 2009                 [Page 17]

Internet-Draft          IPFIX Mediation Framework          November 2008


      Flow Records).

   o  For long-running Flows, the Intermediate Process should expire the
      Flow on a regular basis or based on some expiration policy.  This
      periodicity or expiration policy should be configurable at the
      Intermediate Process.

   The Correlation function also needs similar expiration conditions.
   However, when cached Flow Records/Packet Reports prematurely expire
   and the function can not compute the correlation among them, cached
   Flow Records/Packet reports may be discarded.

4.6.  Information Model

   IPFIX Mediation reuse the general information model from [RFC5101]
   and from [I-D.ietf-psamp-info].  The following new Information
   Elements for IPFIX Mediation are also needed.

   +-----+---------------------------+-----+---------------------------+
   |  ID | Name                      |  ID | Name                      |
   +-----+---------------------------+-----+---------------------------+
   | XXX | averageBitRate            | XXX | averagePacketsRate        |
   | XXX | minimumBitRate            | XXX | minimumPacketsRate        |
   | XXX | maximumBitRate            | XXX | maximumPacketsRate        |
   +-----+---------------------------+-----+---------------------------+

4.7.  Examples

   As example, in case of Intermediate Processes having different
   functions, a Collecting Process/IPFIX File Reader replicates Flow
   Records/Packet Reports, if necessary, and forwards them to a suitable
   Intermediate Process/Exporting Process.  Example figure is shown
   below.
