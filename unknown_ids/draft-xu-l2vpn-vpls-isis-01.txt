Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS           September 2011 
 
    
1. Introduction 

   To support virtual machine (VM) mobility and cluster services in a 
   cloud data center, a scalable L2VPN solution is essential for 
   interconnecting those millions of servers within that data center. 
   Such L2VPN solution SHOULD be able to support the shortest path 
   forwarding and the Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) forwarding 
   capabilities so as to maximize the bandwidth capacity between 
   servers. Besides, it SHOULD be able to provide enough VPN instances 
   in order to isolate a large number of tenants. VPLS seems as a good 
   L2VPN solution for cloud data centers since it can almost meet all 
   of the above requirements. However, the existing VPLS solutions 
   including BGP VPLS [RFC4761] and LDP VPLS [RFC4762] are a bit heavy-
   weight for cloud data center operators due to the following reasons: 
   first, the existing VPLS solutions require one or more separate 
   protocols for VPLS auto-discovery and signaling to be deployed 
   besides IGP which is already deployed; second, full-meshed pseudo-
   wires(PW)introduces more burden and complex on maintenance; third, 
   head-end replication for multicast and broadcast is sub-optimal from 
   the bandwidth utilization perspective. 

   Hence, this document describes a IS-IS[IS-IS][RFC1195] based light-
   weight VPLS solution which retains the scalability features of VPLS 
   while overcoming the shortages of VPLS mentioned above. In IS-IS 
   VPLS, the already deployed IS-IS protocol as IGP in a data center 
   network is extended to realize VPLS auto-discovery and signaling 
   functions with a new extended IS-IS TLV, in addition, there is no 
   full-meshed PWs anymore between PE routers. To achieve better 
   bandwidth utilization, PIM multicast trees could be used for 
   delivering multicast and broadcast traffic, even unknown unicast 
   traffic.  

   Note that, in IS-IS VPLS, the VPLS label contained in the L2VPN data 
   packets (e.g., MAC-in-MPLS-in-IP) is only used for identifying a 
   particular VPLS instance, rather than identifying both a particular 
   VPLS instance and a particular ingress PE router as the PW label 
   does. Therefore, IP-based tunnel is required to be used as the PE-
   to-PE tunnel technology in IS-IS VPLS so that the egress PE router 
   could determine the ingress PE routers of the received L2VPN data 
   packets from the source address of the tunnel header when performing 
   MAC address learning.  

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4664], [VPLS-MCAST], 
   [RFC4761] and [RFC4762].

3. Control Plane 

   There are two primary functions of the VPLS control plane: auto-
   discovery and signaling. In IS-IS VPLS, these two functions are 
   accomplished simultaneously by using a single IS-IS TLV 
   advertisement. One concern of using IS-IS to distribute the VPLS 
   membership information is that the VPLS membership information would 
   be exposed to P routers unnecessarily. However, in today's cloud 
   data center networks which are becoming more and more flat, the 
   number of P routers within a data center network would not be too 
   large, furthermore, the extended IS-IS TLV for VPLS is partially 
   transparent to P routers, that is to say, P routers don't need to 
   process the VPLS membership information contained in that IS-IS TLV, 
   but only need to synchronize the Link State PDUs (LSP) with their 
   adjacent IS-IS neighbors.

Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS           September 2011 
 
           Total number of bytes contained in the value field. 

       PE's IPv4 or IPv6 Address  

           This 128-bit field is filled with one of the PE router's IP 
           addresses which are reachable across the backbone. The 
           address filled in this field SHOULD be used as tunnel 
           destination addresses by remote PE routers when sending a 
           customer packet to such PE router. If the IP address is IPv4, 
           the last four octets of this field are filled with the IPv4 
           address while the remaining part is set to zero. In other 
           words, it is filled with an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. 

       VPLS ID  

           This field is filled with a 20-bit globally unique VPLS ID 
           for a particular attached VPLS instance. In case that a 
           larger VPLS ID space is required, the leftmost 12-bit 
           reserved field could be used together with the VPLS ID field 
           as an extended VPLS ID filed. That is to say, the whole 32 
           bits are filled with a 32-bit long VPLS ID value. 

       VPLS Label 

           This field is filled with a 20-bit MPLS label corresponding 
           to the VPLS instance which is identified by the VPLS ID.  

   3.2. Auto-Discovery 

   In IS-IS VPLS, each PE router could automatically discover which 
   other PE routers are part of a given VPLS instance identified by the 
   globally unique VPLS ID. This allows each PE router's configuration 
   to consist only of the identity of the VPLS instance established on 
   this PE router, not the identity of every other PE router in that 
   VPLS instance. 

   3.3. Signaling 

   In IS-IS VPLS, it is REQUIRED that a PE router SHOULD assign the 
   same MPLS label for a given VPLS instance to any other PE router. In 
   other words, this VPLS label is used for identifying a particular 
   VPLS instance, rather than identifying both a particular VPLS 
   instance and the corresponding ingress PE router as the PW label 
   does. 

   The VPLS label in IS-IS VPLS just needs to be locally unique, rather 
   than globally unique for most cases except the aggregate P-Multicast

   tree based VPLS multicast case where a single P-Multicast tree is 
   shared by more than one VPLS instance and the ability to use 
   upstream-assigned labels [RFC5331] is not available.  

   For example, in unicast and ingress-replication multicast cases 
   [VPLS-MCAST], it is no necessary for the VPLS label to be globally 
   unique. Besides, in the non-aggregative P-Multicast tree [VPLS-MCAST] 
   based VPLS multicast case where a single P-Multicast tree is 
   exclusively used by no more than one VPLS instance, the MAC-in-IP 
   encapsulation is used since the multicast address itself in the IP 
   based tunnel header is enough for identifying a particular VPLS 
   instance. Therefore, it doesn't require the VPLS label to be 
   globally unique either. 

   In the aggregate P-Multicast tree [VPLS-MCAST] based VPLS multicast 
   mode, the globally unique labels could be used if the ability to use 
   upstream-assigned labels is not available. In this case, the VPLS 
   label for a given VPLS instance directly equals the VPLS ID of that 
   VPLS instance. If the globally unique label assignment can not be 
   met in some cases, such multicast mode SHOULD be prohibited.  

4. Data Plane 

   4.1. Data Encapsulation 

    4.1.1. Unicast 

   MAC-in-MPLS-in-IP encapsulation [RFC4448][RFC4023] SHOULD be used 
   for unicast. The IP here means any of IP based encapsulations, such 
   as MPLS-in-IP and MPLS-in-GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation).   

   For unknown unicast, the encapsulation and forwarding is the same as 
   that for multicast/broadcast described in the following section. 

    4.1.2. Multicast/Broadcast  

   There are two major multicast modes for IS-IS VPLS: ingress 
   replication mode and P-Multicast tree mode. 

   The encapsulation corresponding to each mode is described in the 
   following sub-sections. 

    4.1.2.1. Ingress Replication Mode 

   In the ingress replication mode, an ingress PE router forward the CE 
   multicast/broadcast frames received via its attachment circuits 
   towards each remote PE router of the same VPLS instance in the

Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS           September 2011 
 
   separate IP based tunnels destined for each remote PE router. Hence, 
   the encapsulation in this mode has no difference from that for 
   unicast. 

    4.1.2.2. P-Multicast Tree Mode 

   In the non-aggregative P-Multicast tree mode where a single P-
   Multicast distribution tree in the backbone is exclusively used by 
   one VPLS instance, the MAC-in-IP encapsulation is used directly 
   since the destination IP address (i.e., multicast address) contained 
   in the IP-based tunnel header is enough for the egress PE routers to 
   determine which VPLS instance the encapsulated customer packets 
   received from a remote PE router belongs to. 

   For aggregative P-Multicast tree mode in which a single P-Multicast 
   tree is shared by more than one VPLS instance, MAC-in-MPLS-IP 
   encapsulation SHOULD be used. The upstream-assigned MPLS label 
   contained in the inner MPLS header would be used by the egress PE 
   routers to identify the particular VPLS instance that the received 
   customer packets belong to. Alternatively, to avoid using the 
   complex upstream MPLS label assignment mechanism [RFC5331], 
   operators could also use the globally unique VPLS labels provided 
   this usage is doable in such particular network environment (i.e., a 
   relatively close data center network environment). Thus, the VPN ID 
   value for a given VPLS instance would be equal to its corresponding 
   VPLS Label value. 

   More details about the P-Multicast tree mode, especially the 
   aggregative P-Multicast tree mode would be discussed in the future. 

   4.2. Data Forwarding 

   In IS-IS VPLS, there is almost no difference from BGP VPLS and LDP 
   VPLS from the aspect of data forwarding. 

   4.3. MAC Address Learning 

   MAC addresses of local CE hosts can be learnt by a PE router as a 
   normal bridge does. 

   As for learning MAC addresses of remote CE hosts, data-driven MAC 
   learning is still available in IS-IS VPLS. For example, upon 
   receiving an encapsulated customer packet from a remote PE router, 
   the MPLS label contained in the MPLS header of the data packet (or 
   the destination multicast IP address contained in the IP-based 
   tunnel header in the case of using non-aggregative P-Multicast trees 
   for delivering unknown unicast packets)is used to determine the

   particular VPLS instance that the data packet belongs to, while the 
   source IP address contained in the IP-based tunnel header is used to 
   tell from which ingress PE router the data packet is sent.  

   Alternatively, MAC addresses of remote CE hosts can also be learnt 
   on the control plane by using IS-IS for MAC address reachability 
   announcement. Details about how to learn remote CE MAC addresses on 
   the control plane would be specified in the later version of this 
   document. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This document doesn't introduce additional security risk to IS-IS 
   and VPLS, nor does it provide any additional security feature for 
   IS-IS and VPLS. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   The IS-IS TLV code for VPLS is required to be defined by IANA.
