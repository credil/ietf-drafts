                             Echo Protocol 
                 <draft-yevstifeyev-rfc862bis-echo-00>

Abstract

   This document specifies Echo protocol, that was firstly defined in
   RFC 862. However that document does not match current Internet
   Standards and specifies Echo protocol for TCP and UDP only, while a
   number of other transport-layer protocols have appeared since the
   time of publication of RFC 862. 

   This document aligns Echo protocol specification with the current
   Internet Standards and specifies Echo protocol for the most wide-
   spread transport-layer protocols. It obsoletes RFC 347 and RFC 862
   and moves the last to Historic status.

INTERNET DRAFT               Echo Protocol             December 25, 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Echo protocol is a very useful debugging and measurement tool.
   The echo service simply sends back to the originating source any data
   it receives.

   The first proposal of Echo protocol appeared in RFC 347 [RFC347].
   Echo protocol itself was specified in RFC 862 [RFC862]. However this
   document does not match current Internet Standards and specifies Echo
   protocol only for TCP [RFC793] and UDP [RFC768], while a number of
   other transport-layer protocols have appeared sine the time of
   publication of RFC 862. This document aligns the Echo protocol
   specification with current Internet Standards and specifies Echo
   protocol for the most wide-spread transport-layer protocols. It
   obsoletes RFC 347 [RFC347] and RFC 862 [RFC862] and moves the last to
   Historic status [RFC2026].

      Note: This document intentionally makes normative references only
      to Full Standards documents. This is made in order to provide the
      possibility for this specification to become the Full Standard
      without waiting for all the referenced documents become Full
      Standards too.

2.  Protocol Specification 

2.1. DCCP-based Echo Protocol

   The Echo protocol supports DCCP [RFC4340] as a lower-layer protocol.
   If this protocol is used, one DCCP host listens for incoming
   connection on the port TBD1. Once a connection is established any
   data received by this host is sent back. This continues until the
   calling user terminates the connection.

2.2. RDP-based Echo Protocol

   The Echo protocol supports RDP [RFC908] [RFC1151] as a lower-layer
   protocol. If this protocol is used, one RDP host listens for incoming
   connection on the port TBD2. Once a connection is established any
   data received by this host is sent back. This continues until the
   calling user terminates the connection.

2.3. SCTP-based Echo Protocol

   The Echo protocol supports SCTP [RFC4960] as a lower-layer protocol.
   If this protocol is used, one SCTP host listens for incoming
   connection on the port TBD3. Once a connection is established any
   data received by this host is sent back. This continues until the
   calling user terminates the connection.

2.4. TCP-Based Echo Protocol

   The Echo protocol supports TCP [RFC793] as a lower-layer protocol. If
   this protocol is used, one TCP host listens for incoming connection
   on the port 7. Once a connection is established any data received by
   this host is sent back. This continues until the calling user
   terminates the connection.

2.5. UDP-based Echo Protocol

   The Echo protocol supports UDP [RFC768] as a lower-layer protocol. If
   this protocol is used, a UDP host listens for UDP datagrams on UDP
   port 7. When a datagram is received, the data from it is sent back in
   an answering datagram.

3.  Security Considerations

   The echo protocol is not believed to cause any security issues that
   can be discussed by this memo.

4. RFC Editor Considerations

   RFC Editor is asked to mark the following documents as obsoleted by
   this RFC:

   RFC 347 [RFC347]

   RFC 862 [RFC862]

   RFC Editor is also asked to mark RFC 862 [RFC862] as Historic RFC.


5. IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the DCCP port number TBD1 for use with Echo
   protocol.

   IANA has assigned the RDP port number TBD2 for use with Echo
   protocol.

   IANA has assigned the SCTP port number TBD3 for use with Echo
   protocol.

   IANA has assigned the TCP port number 7 for use with Echo protocol.

   IANA has assigned the UDP port number 7 for use with Echo protocol.
