Abstract 

   This document describes an ESP encapsulation for IPsec, allowing 
   intermediate devices to ascertain if ESP-NULL is being employed 
   and hence inspect the IPsec packets for network monitoring and 
   access control functions.  Currently in the IPsec standard, 
   there is no way to differentiate between ESP encryption and ESP 
   NULL encryption by simply examining a packet.

1. Introduction 

   Use of ESP within IPsec [RFC4303] specifies how ESP packet 
   encapsulation is performed.  It also specifies that ESP can use 
   NULL encryption [RFC2410] while preserving data integrity and 
   authenticity.  The exact encapsulation and algorithms employed 
   are negotiated out-of-band using, for example, IKEv2 [RFC4306] 
   and based on policy.  

   Enterprise environments typically employ numerous security 
   policies (and tools for enforcing them), as related to access 
   control, firewalls, network monitoring functions, deep packet 
   inspection, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS and 
   IPS), scanning and detection of viruses and worms, etc.  In 
   order to enforce these policies, network tools and intermediate 
   devices require visibility into packets, ranging from simple 
   packet header inspection to deeper payload examination.  Network 
   security protocols which encrypt the data in transit prevent 
   these network tools from performing the aforementioned 
   functions.  

   When employing IPsec within an enterprise environment, it is 
   desirable to employ ESP instead of AH [RFC4302], as AH does not 
   work in NAT environments. Furthermore, in order to preserve the 
   above network monitoring functions, it is desirable to use ESP-
   NULL. In a mixed mode environment some packets containing 
   sensitive data employ a given encryption cipher suite, while 
   other packets employ ESP-NULL. For an intermediate device to 
   unambiguously distinguish which packets are leveraging ESP-NULL, 
   they would require knowledge of all the policies being employed 
   for each protected session. This is clearly not practical. 
   Heuristic-based methods can be employed to parse the packets,

   but these can be very expensive, containing numerous rules based 
   on each different protocol and payload.  Even then, the parsing 
   may not be robust in cases where fields within a given encrypted 
   packet happen to resemble the fields for a given protocol or 
   heuristic rule.  This is even more problematic when different 
   length Initialization Vectors (IVs), Integrity Check Values 
   (ICVs) and padding are used for different security associations, 
   making it difficult to determine the start and end of the 
   payload data, let alone attempting any further parsing.  
   Furthermore, storage, lookup and cross-checking a set of 
   comprehensive rules against every packet adds cost to hardware 
   implementations and degrades performance. In cases where the 
   packets may be encrypted, it is also wasteful to check against 
   heuristics-based rules, when a simple exception policy (e.g., 
   allow, drop or redirect) can be employed to handle the encrypted 
   packets. Because of the non-deterministic nature of heuristics-
   based rules for disambiguating between encrypted and non-
   encrypted data, an alternative method for enabling intermediate 
   devices to function in encrypted data environments needs to be 
   defined. Enterprise environments typically use both stateful and 
   stateless packet inspection mechanisms. The previous 
   considerations weigh particularly heavy on stateless mechanisms 
   such as router ACLs and NetFlow exporters. 

   This document defines a mechanism to prove additional 
   information in relevant IPsec packets so intermediate devices 
   can efficiently differentiate between encrypted ESP packets and 
   ESP packets with NULL encryption. 

   The document is consistent with the operation of ESP in NAT 
   environments [RFC3947]. 

   The design principles for this protocol are the following: 

   o  Allow easy identification and parsing of integrity-only IPsec 
   traffic 

   o  Leverage the existing hardware IPsec parsing engines as much 
   as possible to minimize additional hardware design costs 

   o  Minimize the packet overhead in the common case

1.2. Applicability Statement 

   The document is applicable only to the wrapped ESP header 
   defined below, and does not describe any changes to either ESP 
   [RFC4303] nor AH [RFC4302]. 

2. Wrapped ESP (WESP) Header format 

   The proposal is to define a protocol number for Wrapped ESP 
   encapsulation (WESP), which provides additional attributes in 
   each packet to assist in differentiating between encrypted and 
   non-encrypted data, as well as aid parsing of the packet.  This 
   extension essentially acts as a wrapper to the existing ESP 
   protocol and provides an additional 4 octets at the front of the 
   existing ESP packet. This may be depicted simply as follows: 

  0                   1                   2                   3 
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

  |                                                               |

                     Figure 1 WESP Packet Format 

   By preserving the body of the existing ESP packet format, a 
   compliant implementation can simply add in the new header, 
   without needing to change the body of the packet. The value of 
   the new protocol used to identify this new header is TBD via 
   IANA. Further details are shown below:

   Next Header:  next protocol header (encrypted in ESP trailer, 
   but in the clear in header), providing easy access to a HW 
   parser to extract the upper layer protocol. Note: For security 
   concerns, this value may optionally be set to zero, in which 
   case the next header an be extracted from the ESP trailer. 

   HdrLen: includes the new header + full ESP header + the IV (if 
   present).  It is an offset to the beginning of the Payload Data. 

   TrailerLen: Offset from the end of the packet including the ICV, 
   pad length, and any padding.  It is an offset from the end of 
   the packet to the last byte of the payload data. 

   Flags 

       2 bits: Version 

       6 bits: reserved for future use.  These MUST be set to zero 
   per this specification, but usage may be defined by other 
   specifications. 

   As can be seen, this wrapped ESP format simply extends the 
   standard ESP header by the first 4 octets. 

2.1. UDP Encapsulation 

   This section describes a mechanism for running the new packet 
   format over the existing UDP encapsulation of ESP as defined in 
   RFC 3948. This allows leveraging the existing IKE negotiation of 
   the UDP port for NAT-T discovery and usage [RFC3947], as well as 
   preserving the existing UDP ports for ESP (port 4500).  With UDP 
   encapsulation, the packet format can be depicted as follows.

                Figure 3 UDP-Encapsulated WESP Header 

   Where: 

   Source/Destination port (4500) and checksum: describes the UDP 
   encapsulation header, per RFC3948. 

   Protocol Identifier: new field to demultiplex between UDP 
   encapsulation of IKE, UDP encapsulation of ESP per RFC 3948, and  
   the UDP encapsulation in this specification. 

    

    

   According to RFC 3948, clause 2.2, a 4 octet value of zero (0) 
   immediately following the UDP header indicates a Non-ESP marker, 
   which can be used to assume that the data following that value 
   is an IKE packet.  Similarly, a value of non-zero indicates that 
   the packet is an ESP packet and the 4-octet value can be treated 
   as the ESP SPI. However, RFC 4303, clause 2.1 indicates that the 
   values 1-255 are reserved and cannot be used as the SPI.  We 
   leverage that knowledge and use a value of 1 to indicate that 
   the UDP encapsulated ESP header contains this new packet format 
   for ESP encapsulation. 

   The remaining fields in the packet have the same meaning as per 
   section 2.0 above.

2.2. Tunnel and Transport mode of considerations 

   This extension is equally applicable for tunnel and transport 
   mode where the ESP Next Header field is used to differentiate 
   between these modes, as per the existing IPsec specifications. 

2.3. IKE Considerations 

   In order to negotiate the new format of ESP encapsulation via 
   IKE [RFC4306], both parties need to agree to use the new packet 
   format. This can be achieved by proposing a new protocol ID 
   within the existing IKE proposal structure as defined by RFC 
   4306, clause 3.3.1. The existing proposal substructure in this 
   clause allows negotiation of ESP/AH (among others) by using 
   different protocol Ids for these protocols. By using the same 
   protocol substructure in the proposal payload and using a new 
   value (TBD) for this encapsulation, the existing IKE negotiation 
   can be leverage with minimal changes to support negotiation of 
   this encapsulation. 

   Furthermore, because the negotiation is at the protocol level, 
   other transforms remain valid for this new encapsulation and 
   consistent with IKEv2 [RFC4306]. Additionally, NAT-T [RFC3948] 
   is wholly compatible with this wrapped frame format and can be 
   used as-is, without any modifications, in environments where NAT 
   is present and needs to be taken into account. 

3. Security Considerations 

   As this document augments the existing ESP encapsulation format, 
   UDP encapsulation definitions specified in RFC 3948 and IKE 
   negotiation of the new encapsulation, the security observations 
   made in those documents also apply here. In addition, as this 
   document allows intermediate device visibility into IPsec ESP 
   encapsulated frames for the purposes of network monitoring 
   functions, care should be taken not to send sensitive data over 
   connections using definitions from this document, based on 
   network domain/administrative policy. A strong key agreement 
   protocol, such as IKE, together with a strong policy engine 
   should be used to in determining appropriate security policy for 
   the given traffic streams and data over which it is being 
   employed. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   Reserving an appropriate value for this encapsulation as well as 
   a new value for the protocol in the IKE negotiation is TBD by 
   IANA.
