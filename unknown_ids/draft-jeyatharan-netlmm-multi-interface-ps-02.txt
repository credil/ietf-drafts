Abstract

   The specific mechanism described in the current PMIPv6 draft to
   support multihoming is such that a unique prefix is given to each
   interface of a Mobile Node (multiple unique prefixes per MN) that is
   attached to the PMIPv6 domain.  However, multihoming can also be
   provided using same unique prefix for all interfaces of MN (single
   unique prefix per MN).  This memo explores and highlights some issues
   associated with multihoming support in PMIPv6: using single unique

1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile Internet Protocol Version Six (PMIPv6) is a network
   based mobility management protocol which provides mobility management
   to all type of nodes including multiple interfaced (MuIf) mobile
   nodes (MNs) that may or may not have client MIPv6 (CMIPv6)
   functionality.  Details of protocol operation and related
   terminologies are given in [1].  The PMIPv6 draft [1] highlight
   multihoming support for MuIf MNs where a unique prefix is given to
   each interface of MN.  The base draft adopted such a multiple unique
   prefixes per MN model or unique prefix per MN interface model to
   provide basic multihoming support and connectivity to an unmodified
   MN.  "Unmodified" MN is generally understood as mobile nodes that do
   not have any software changes to attain network based mobility
   management.  However, multihoming can also be provided using single
   unique prefix for all interfaces of MN and one need not restrict to
   unique prefix per interface type of allocation.

   The multihoming support that is covered in the base PMIPv6 draft is
   simply simultaneous attachment support for a multiple interfaced MN.
   However, there are many scenarios associated with multiple interface
   attachment such as simultaneous usage of multiple interfaces for a
   single flow, preference setting at an anchoring point to enable a
   certain flow to traverse via a certain interface or access technology
   type associated with MN, vertical hand-off support when MN has two or
   more multiple interfaces connected to the network, MuIf MN performing
   roaming between home and foreign domains using one of its interfaces
   whereas another interface is still attached to the home domain.
   These advanced scenarios need specific solutions which require some
   enhancement/modification to the current PMIPv6 protocol.  In this
   memo we also analyze a case where MN sees multiple prefixes via a
   single interface and configures different addresses and requires both
   PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 states at the anchoring point.  We also analyze a
   case where MN sees both home and foreign prefixes via its single
   interface and chooses a preferred prefix, and, as a result, requires
   some changes to the PMIPv6 protocol operation.

   The main objective of this memo is to analyze and highlight the
   problems in these above mentioned advanced multihoming scenarios and
   to highlight the necessity of further work that is required for the
   basic PMIPv6 protocol to support the above described multihoming
   scenarios.  We perform scenario analysis for two different type of
   PMIPv6 multihoming models which are the single unique prefix per MN
   model and multiple unique prefixes per MN model so that one can
   understand the problems and also one can see which model is preferred
   for a certain multihoming scenario.  In addition to the above
   mentioned analysis, how to support multihoming for an unmodified MN
   when PMIPv6 deploys a single unique prefix per MN model.  Finally, in

   Appendix B and Appendix C, the multihoming problem analysis is
   focused on an advanced scenario such as roaming and multiple local
   mobility anchors (LMAs).  It is considered that the LMA can also
   operate as a MIPv6 home agent.  Thus LMA/HA or LMA will denote a
   collocated PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 anchoring point.

   Many Standard Organizations (SDO) such as third generation
   partnership project (3GPP), third generation partnership project 2
   (3GPP2) and WiMAX Forum are very much interested in adopting PMIPv6
   as a mobility management protocol.  We have done some study on the
   3GPP architecture and thus in this memo, wherever appropriate, we are
   highlighting PMIPv6 multihoming problems pertaining towards the 3GPP
   service architecture evolution (SAE) network structure.
   Nevertheless, we would not exclude such problem analysis for other
   SDO architectures that will adopt the PMIPv6 protocol for multihoming
   purposes.  Some of the scenarios where PMIPv6 is considered to be
   used is clearly defined in [2].  In document [2], multiple interface
   related scenarios considered are only related to vertical hand-off
   between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access and vertical hand-off between
   non-3GPP accesses.  Nevertheless, in this memo, we have considered
   many futuristic multihoming scenarios that may well be adapted by
   3GPP and other SDOs.  Basic concepts and usefulness of multihoming is
   already well defined in [3] and are thus omitted from this document.
   However, in this document, wherever possible, the benefits of each
   multihoming scenario being analyzed is highlighted.  Moreover the
   validity of each scenario is emphasized with respect to current 3GPP
   activities as outlined in [2] and possibly future 3GPP activities.


2.  Multiple Interfaces Support Models in PMIPv6

   When a node with multiple interfaces is roaming in a PMIPv6 domain,
   there are various benefits it can enjoy if the PMIPv6 domain allows
   more than one interfaces to be used simultaneously.  As mentioned
   previously, these benefits can be found in other documents [3].  It
   should be noted that some benefits could be enjoyed by the PMIPv6
   domain or the operator as well.  For instance, when the LMA receives
   a packet destined for a multiple interfaced MN, the LMA may be able
   to choose amongst the multiple routes to better utilize the network
   resources of the PMIPv6 domain or to avoid congested region of the
   PMIPv6 domain.

   In this section, a brief analysis and principle of the two PMIPv6
   multihoming models (same unique prefix across all interfaces and per
   interface unique prefix) are given.  Furthermore for each of the
   models, the lack of support for simultaneous usage of all interfaces
   for a certain flow and the lack of support for setting filter rules
   are outlined.  These are issues related to classic multihoming.

   However, there are more issues that are related to vertical hand-offs
   when MN has multiple interfaces which will be detailed in other
   sections.

2.1.  Different Home Network Prefix for Each Interface

   o  Operation complexity at LMA/HA to support unique prefix per
      interface allocation

      In this case, each interface of MN is allocated a unique Home
      Network Prefix.  To ensure that each interface of MN gets a unique
      prefix, the LMA will use a MN interface identifier (ID) inserted
      in the Proxy Binding Update (PBU), a hand-off flag in PBU and its
      own binding cache entries to allocate such unique prefix per
      interface.  This multiple prefix model is described in greater
      detail in [1].  If the interface ID (If-ID) in PBU is not
      available at the LMA binding cache, and if the hand-off flag is
      set to "1" (implying new connection request), the LMA will assign
      a new prefix for the interface.  When the interface ID which is
      sent in the PBU is matched to an entry in LMA, then the LMA will
      treat it as horizontal hand-off (i.e. one interface disconnecting
      from a mobile access gateway (MAG) and connecting to another MAG)
      and assign the same prefix for session continuity.  For advanced
      hand-off scenarios such as vertical hand-off (i.e. one interface
      shutting down and transferring flows to a newly powered on
      interface), the LMA will use more information such as vertical
      hand-off flag inserted in the PBU, as well as disconnected
      interface's If-ID, to assign the same prefix of the disconnected
      interface to the new interface.  Suffice to say, the prefix
      allocation logic is pretty complex at LMA for this multiple prefix
      model because correct prefixes needs to be assigned based on MN's
      state such as new connection, horizontal hand-off and vertical
      hand-off.

   o  Lack of Simultaneous Usage Support

      Since unique prefix is assigned to each interface of MN, for
      practical purpose, this model can be treated as multiple MNs each
      having a single interface.  Thus, in a general sense, LMA will not
      be able to perform path switching for packets addressed to a
      particular interface.  For example, MN's IF1 is assigned a prefix
      (P1) and MN's IF2 is assigned another prefix (P2).  When LMA
      receives a packet addressed to an address configured using P1, LMA
      would not route such packet via MN's IF2 path.  In some use cases,
      it is preferred that a flow traverses via all interfaces of MN for
      example to achieve load sharing and load balancing benefits and
      where possible using a less costly wireless access for the flows
      whenever simultaneous access via different interfaces can be

      achieved (ex. hierarchical cell structures).  If MN is an IPv6
      host using SHIM6 (Site Multihoming by IPv6 Intermediation) [4] or
      SCTP (Stream Control Transport Protocol) [5] or MN is a MONAMI6
      capable node [6], then the MN can continue to enjoy simultaneous
      usage benefits such as a flow coming towards a MN address can be
      reached via one or more of MN interfaces.  Unless some changes are
      done to PMIPv6 protocol, these external protocols are needed to
      achieve multihoming benefits.

   o  Lack of Flow Filtering Support

      Setting filter rules at the home agent (HA) to set preference of a
      certain flow to traverse via a certain care-of address (CoA), when
      roaming in foreign domain, is a well understood method and is
      described in [7].  However, in PMIPv6, the situation is slightly
      different.  For example, if a MuIf MN is roaming in a local domain
      and PMIPv6 is used for mobility management, then MN will see
      different prefixes via its different interfaces and these prefixes
      will be used for session establishment with CNs (correspondent
      nodes).  If MN wishes certain flows to be delivered via a certain
      access technology due to cost, quality of service (QoS),
      bandwidth, preference and security, then, such filter rules should
      be set at the local mobility anchor.  However, MN operating in the
      PMIPv6 mode does not know its LMA/HA or the packet data network
      gateway (P-GW) address (P-GW is equivalent to LMA/HA in 3GPP
      architecture).  In such a case, MN needs to pass its flow
      filtering rules to the MAG to which it is attached.  As described,
      such flow filtering support mechanisms are essential even when
      PMIPv6 is used and currently not supported in PMIPv6.  If PMIPv6
      does not support a mechanism to set filter rules, then the only
      way MN can attain the preference setting is by setting the
      preference at CN.  If the CNs are placed far away from MN, then
      setting such filters at CN increases the signaling cost or
      signaling load in the fixed infrastructure.

   o  Prefix Resource Usage

      Another general issue with this multiple prefixes model is that
      prefix resources are wasted and in some cases, a node may not get
      a prefix in PMIPv6 domain if the PMIPv6 domain is supporting
      numerous MNs with many active interfaces.

2.2.  Same Home Network Prefix for Each Interface

   In this case, each interface will receive the same Home Network
   Prefix.  In such a scenario, MN should accept or probably be
   configured to accept packets to be received by any interface as long
   as the destination address matches the Home Network Prefix regardless

   of the actual address configured (or assigned) for that interface.
   When PMIPv6 implements this single prefix model, there is no need for
   the MN to run separate multihoming enabling protocols (such as SHIM6,
   SCTP, MONAMI6) to enjoy benefits of multihoming.  The main advantage
   of this model is that complex prefix allocation mechanism at LMA/HA
   can be avoided and prefix resources are not wasted.

   The single prefix model can be implemented using three different
   mechanisms.  We next briefly describe these methods and discuss the
   merits and drawbacks of each of these methods and furthermore compare
   against the multiple prefixes model.

   o  Prefix Based Caches

      When prefix based caches are maintained at LMA/HA, since the
      prefixes are the same, to maintain separation in the cache
      entries, interface identifiers (If-ID) or binding identifiers
      (BIDs) needs to be used.  Binding Identifiers are described in
      draft [6].  The main problem with this method is that, routing is
      based on prefixes and there is a tendency for packets sent to a
      particular address being routed to a wrong interface if the MN
      configures different addresses for its interfaces.  When compared
      to the multiple prefixes model, simultaneous usage can be easily
      achieved because a flow can be routed via any of the MN
      interfaces.  This is because the routing is based on prefix and
      there is only a single prefix assigned for all interfaces.
      However, to achieve simultaneous usage, the MAGs needs to be
      informed of MN other interface address or need to be configured in
      such a way that the layer two (L2) reachability of MN interface is
      tied to the prefix of MN.  Furthermore, when setting filter rules,
      the flow parameters can be tied with the interface identifier or
      BID that is available in the cache.

   o  Different Address Based Caches

      Here the MN configures different addresses for its interfaces and
      the caches at the LMA/HA are address based rather than prefix
      based.  When address based caches are used, interface identifiers
      need not be used to separate the bindings.  The main drawback of
      this method is that the routing path at the LMA cannot be set up
      until address configuration is complete and there is a slight
      delay in routing path set up.  The problem of packets being routed
      wrongly does not occur since the routing at the LMA/HA is address
      based.  However, to attain simultaneous usage benefits proper
      mechanisms needs to be in place at the LMA/HA and the MAGs.  For
      example the LMA/HA need to identify all MN addresses belong to
      same MN and then tunnel packets of a certain address via other
      MAGs that have reachability state for MN other addresses.

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM            June 2008


      Furthermore, the MAGs need appropriate mechanisms to allow packets
      that are addressed to other interfaces that are not directly
      connected to it to be routed.  In this address based mechanism,
      filter rules can be tied to the address associated with the
      interface itself.  Basically, MN will set filter rules by tying
      the flow parameters to the address of the interface.

   o  Same Address Based Caches

      In this method, all MN interfaces configures the same address.
      Thus the problems described as to packets being routed wrongly or
      the simultaneous usage issue does not occur in this
      implementation.  However, preference or filter rules needs to be
      set.  Since the caches are separated probably using interface
      identifiers, the flow filtering setting needs to tie the flow to
      the interface identifier.


3.  Multiple Interface Problem Analysis for Single Prefix Model

   In this section, problem analysis for multihomed nodes such as
   multiple interfaced nodes when PMIPv6 uses a single unique prefix per
   MN model is presented.  The assumption in the analysis regarding to
   which PMIPv6 functional entity is mapped to which entity in 3GPP
   architecture is based on details provided in documents such as [8]
   and [2].

   o  Maintaining simultaneous bindings at LMA/HA in 3GPP architecture

      We first explore some fundamental issues if PMIPv6 uses single
      prefix per MN type of multihoming support.  Figure 1 shows a
      multiple interfaced MN, which is simultaneously attached to a
      PMIPv6 network via both its interfaces.  It is considered that
      MN.If1 (i.e.  Interface 1 of MN) is a wireless local area network
      (WLAN) type of interface and MN.If2 is a third generation cellular
      (3G) interface such as the evolved universal terrestrial radio
      access network (E-UTRAN) interface.  It is further assumed that
      PMIPv6 protocol is deployed in 3GPP evolved packet core (EPC)
      network where MN.If1 is attached to the evolved packet data
      gateway (ePDG) via a IPSec tunnel and MN.If2 is attached to
      Serving Gateway (S-GW)/MAG2 which is its first hop router.  It is
      considered that the ePDG/MAG1 is not the first hop router for
      MN.If1.  More information on 3GPP architectural entities and their
      roles can be obtained from 3GPP technical specifications [8] and
      [2].  It is important to appreciate that MN accessing both 3G and
      WLAN services while moving can provide many multihoming benefits
      to the MN.  Furthermore, having both interfaces on during inter

      access technolgy hand-off is also a possible optimization scenario
      for vertical hand-off.

      If such single prefix type of multihoming is supported, then there
      needs to be some parameter (If-ID, BID etc) in the LMA/HA cache to
      differentiate the bindings from same MN.  It is important to
      appreciate that in the single prefix model, as shown in Figure 1,
      the interface IDs are merely used to differentiate the binding
      entries associated with multiple interfaces of MN.  Interface IDs
      are not used in prefix assignment.  In such single prefix model,
      the Network Access Identifier (NAI) will be used for prefix
      assignment because only a single prefix needs to be assigned to a
      multiple interface MN.

      In Figure 1 it is assumed that MN.If1 roams into the PMIPv6 domain
      first and gets attached to MAG1.  The routing state created due to
      attachment at MAG1 is shown by the first entry in the binding
      cache (BC).  When MN.If2 detects 3G and does association, MAG2
      will send a new Proxy Binding Update (PBU) to the LMA/HA,
      requesting to bind the Home Network Prefix of MN to the proxy
      care-of address (CoA) which is MAG2.Addr (see 2nd BCE).  It is
      further assumed that the PBU has If-ID information in an option.
      Basically these interface IDs can be media access control (MAC)
      addresses or these can be interface identifiers that MN use to
      form global unicast address.  If the latter type of interface
      identifiers are used, then it is extremely important that they are
      unique across MN interfaces.  Thus, as advised in [1], the use of
      MAC addresses are preferred for interface IDs, due to their
      uniqueness per interface.  These interface IDs (assuming MAC
      address) can be readily obtained by MAGs if they are first hop
      routers.  Since MAG1 is an ePDG as shown in Figure 1, then, using
      simple MAC addresses may not work as the MAC address cannot be
      obtained from IPSec tunnel establishment signal.

      In such a problematic case of an ePDG being a MAG, proper
      mechanisms should be in place to get the correct If-ID.  There can
      be a case where ePDG in Figure 1 does not know If-ID and generates
      a random If-ID.  If this If-ID is same as MN's some other
      interface If-ID (ex.  MN.If2 identifier), then this may overwrite
      an existing If-ID that is available at LMA/HA cache.  Such
      overwriting at LMA/HA will cause a loss of a valid routing state.
      In such a scenario where MAG is an ePDG, one possible way is for
      MN to generate an If-ID and explicitly inform the ePDG during
      IPSec tunnel establishment.  Alternatively, MN can simply inform
      ePDG its MAC address during tunnel establishment.  Another way is
      for Authentication Authorization Accounting server (AAA) to
      generate If-IDs for initial attachments and assume that If-IDs can
      be transferred via context transfer for hand-off attachments.  Yet



Jeyatharan, et al.      Expires December 19, 2008              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM            June 2008


      another way is for the MAG/ePDG to query nearby routers for MN's
      If-IDs and then generate a unique interface ID.  With so many
      approaches, some further analysis needs to be performed to select
      the best possible method.  We feel some MN involvement may be
      required to attain this objective because only the MN will know
      its unique interfaces and its identifiers in all scenarios
      (initial attacment, hand-off and bootup).

   o  Simultaneous access support for unmodified MN

      Suppose we consider MN is an unmodified host in Figure 1 and
      performs such a simultaneous attachment, and if it is given same
      address as MN.If1 for MN.If2 via statefull address configuration
      method, then MN.If2 may not be able to configure a global address
      (perhaps a Duplicate Address Detection (DAD failure)) and that
      interface will not be used.  In such a case, MN can only receive
      packets via MN.If1 and packets sent to MAG2 will be lost until
      MAG2 detects that MN.If2 is not attached and sends a
      deregistration PBU to LMA/HA.  Thus, ideal multihoming is not
      obtained.  On the other hand, if MN configures different addresses
      on its interfaces using stateless address configuration (assuming
      different interface identifier for each interface), then
      successful simultaneous attachment can be obtained.  However,
      packets arriving at LMA/HA to address of MN.If1 may be sent via
      MAG2 and MAG2 will drop the packets because it does not have a
      neighbour cache entry mapping address of MN.If1 to the layer two
      (L2) address of MN.If2.  Thus, it can be clearly seen that,
      although multihoming support is available at LMA/HA, when LMA/HA
      routes packets based on prefix, packets to one address to which a
      MAG does not have supporting neighbour cache entry will be lost.

      To solve the above mentioned problem for an unmodified host when
      it configures same address for both its interfaces may be
      difficult.  We feel that some changes can be done at the network
      side to prevent activation of stateful mode of address
      configuration for unmodified host and thus avoid same address
      being configured for its interfaces.  Another possible means is
      that the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) signal can be
      intercepted by MAGs and MAG could insert some interface specific
      options to the DHCP message so that the DHCP server assigns
      different addresses.  Or, as discussed in the NetLMM mailing list,
      the unmodified host can be configured with a single virtual
      interface at layer three (L3) to mitigate this issue.

3.2.  Problem Analysis for Handoff Scenarios

   o  Horizontal Handoff for Multiple Interfaced MN

      Handoffs are generally classified as horizontal handoff and
      vertical handoff.  Horizontal handoff from L3 perspective means
      handoff of a single interface from current access router(AR)/MAG
      to another access router/MAG which results in a change in the L3
      routing path to the LMA.  In this sub-section, for a multiple
      interfaced MN involved in horizontal handoff, we focus on MuIf MN
      creating the correct routing state at LMA/HA during horizontal
      handoff and horizontal handoff optimization by means of using
      multiple interfaces.

      In a multiple interface scenario using the single prefix model,
      when one of the interface performs horizontal handoff while the
      other interface is still attached, the problem is not very
      complex.  The reason being the new MAG only needs to know the
      If-ID of the interface that is performing the horizontal handoff
      to create the correct routing entry at LMA/HA.  Again, the new MAG
      can get to know this If-ID by various means.  New MAG can get to
      know If-ID via context transfer from old MAG, from AAA, from the
      MN, or obtaining directly from MAC address.  For horizontal hand-
      off case, we do not foresee any issue as long as there are
      appropriate mechanisms in the system for the new MAG to know the
      If-ID.

      Another area of interest is horizontal handoff delay optimization
      and thus preventing packet loss during handoff.  In the multiple
      interface case, the horizontal handoff of a certain interface can
      be optimized using another stable interface (i.e. interface that
      is not perfoming handoff).  For example, during the time when
      there is no routing state at the LMA/HA associated with an
      interface, such as the time between MN dereg PBU has arrived from
      old MAG and the new PBU has not arrived from the new MAG, the
      packets can easily be routed via another stable interface.  Such
      an optimisation can be easily achieved using the single prefix per
      MN model.  This is because all the routing states associated with
      MN is based on a single prefix.  Thus LMA can easily utilize a
      stable interface to route packets during horizontal handoff.
      Probably the only change that has to be done in the system is that
      the MN needs to notify the address of the interface that is
      undergoing handoff to the MAG that is attached to its stable
      interface.  Horizontal handoff event that will result in access
      router change should be detected using L2 specific mechanisms and
      notified to the L3 of the protocol stack of MN.  Once such
      triggers received at L3, MN should perform such triggering to the
      stable MAG.  Such a scenario is a very probable scenario in 3GPP



Jeyatharan, et al.      Expires December 19, 2008              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM            June 2008


      where a MN can be roaming in such a manner where one interface is
      connected to 3G interface and the other interface is connected to
      WLAN.  Since WLAN cells are smaller, MN will go through many
      horizontal handoffs for the WLAN interface while still being
      attached to the same cellular cell.  Thus, by using the stable
      interface, packet loss can be reduced and this scenario very
      clearly shows that horizontal handoff optimization can be obtained
      using the single prefix model and multiple interface usage.  In
      some cases, the MN may want all its data flows to come via WLAN
      interface due to cost consideration, but may want to keep the
      cellular interface active just to achieve horizontal handoff
      optimization just described.  Alternatively, when MN moves through
      WLAN cells, then MN way want to power on 3G interface for
      horizontal handoff optimization.

   o  Vertical Handoff for Multiple Interfaced MN


      *  Vertical Handoff between two interfaces

         First we will analyse vertical handoff between two interfaces.
         For the vertical handoff case (MN shutting down an interface
         and transferring flows to a newly powered on interface), the
         same prefix is given to the new interface (single prefix model
         and PMIPv6 MM mechanism is used).  There need not be any
         specific mechanism as in multiple prefix model to get the same
         prefix via the newly powered on interface.  Basically, if MN's
         interface 1 shuts down and there are flows addressed to MN.If1,
         then when MN.If2 powers on, these flows can be readily received
         at MAG2 after MAG2 has established the IP bearer or the routing
         path at LMA/HA.  The only problem in the vertical handoff case
         is that the address of MN.If2 may be different from address of
         MN.If1 and MAG2 may discard these packets that are addressed to
         MN.If1.  In such a case, appropriate mechanism should be in
         place.  For example, the MN may need to inform MAG2 about
         address of MN.If1, so that MAG2 can transfer packets to MN.If2
         without dropping the packets.  Again, to solve the above
         mentioned issue, some terminal involvement may be required.
         Perhaps a link layer (L2) trigger from MN may be sufficient if
         MAG2 is directly attached to MN.  This said L2 trigger could be
         such that MN informs the address of MN.If1 to MAG2.
         Alternatively, MN.If2 can configure the same address as MN.If1
         to solve this issue.  Another issue that needs to be tackled is
         that, if MN is going to perform address autoconfiguration, then
         until the address is configured and neighbour discovery
         procedure are completed, the packets that are received at MAG2
         may be dropped if sufficient buffering resources are not
         available.  Such issues are being looked into in the following



Jeyatharan, et al.      Expires December 19, 2008              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM            June 2008


         documents [9] [10].  These said documents are looking at
         transient or secondary caches to solve the buffering issue
         mentioned previously and also handling uplink packet loss via
         the previous interface during inter technology handoff.  One
         way of solving this buffering issue at the new MAG can be using
         context transfer during vertical handoff where the prefix is
         informed via the context transfer message to the target MAG.
         The target MAG has some validated information (sent by context
         transfer) about the validity of the ownership of this prefix by
         MN.  Thus, target MAG when it receives context transfer
         signalling, will advertise router advertisement (RA) and
         simultaneously send the signaling to set up the IP bearer path
         at LMA/HA.

      *  Vertical Handoff when MN is attached via more than two
         interfaces

         Here we consider a scenario where vertical handoff is
         associated with two interfaces, while there is still a
         connection available via a third stable interface.  The main
         advantage of this scenario is that, during vertical handoff
         process until new interface address configuration is complete,
         the third non-romaing interface can be used to receive packets.
         Since in vertical hand-off, the address configuration delay is
         present, the MN can use the third stable interface for this
         purpose.  Basically, the MN can inform LMA about the address
         configuring state and use the third interface rather than
         performing the make before break kind of handoff for the
         interface that is performing the vertical handoff.  This
         scenario highlights some further work that may be done for MuIf
         terminals involved in vertical handoff.

                 Figure 2: Single Prefix Flow Filter Issue

   In this section we assume that MN has multihoming capability.  In the
   single prefix multiple interface scenario, there is a specific
   problem that needs to be tackled when MN sets filter rules at home
   agent and is currently attached to a foreign domain.  This is
   explained in detail below.

   In Figure 2, MN sets filter rules at HA which is the Packet Data
   Network Gateway (P-GW) in the 3GPP model.  MN prefers flow1 to
   traverse the WLAN interface and flow2 to traverse the cellular/3G
   interface.  Thus, MN sets filter rules accordingly at HA.  However,
   due to foreign LMA/foreign P-GW implementing prefix based routing,
   flow1 can be routed wrongly and may arrive via the cellular MAG.
   This is certainly an issue and adequate mechanisms needs to be in
   place to rectify this.  When MN's flow preference is broken, MN may
   need to appropriately set the filter rules at the correct entity
   (foreign LMA).  It is further assumed that in Figure 2, MN gets the
   foreign prefix (local breakout prefix in 3GPP jargon) in the foreign
   domain.  Foreign prefix can be used for route optimization without
   trading off the advantage of network based mobility management PMIPv6

   offers.  If in another scenario, MN is directly connected to home
   PMIPv6 domain, then MN may need to set filter rules at HA.

      Figure 3: Attaching Multiple Interfaces to PMIPv6 that deploys
                           Multiple Prefix Model

   In Figure 3, it is considered that MN can be an IPv6 host or CMIPv6
   enabled host.  It is also considered that MN is attached to PMIPv6
   domain and wants PMIPv6 MM mechanism via both its access technology
   type using 3GPP specific mobility selection mechanism.  MN receives
   different prefixes via each of its interfaces.  Basically, when
   MN.If1 attaches to PMIPv6 network, the first BC entry will be
   created.  When MN.If2 attaches to PMIPv6 network, the second BC entry
   will be created.  The prefixes are sufficient to separate the caches.
   However, these If-IDs are required for prefix assignment purposes.
   The multiple prefix model does not create any confusion to an
   unmodified IPv6 host that does simultaneous attachment because there

   is no possibility that a multi-link subnet will be experienced by the
   MN.  However, if MN is having flows with multiple CNs and a certain
   CN sends packets to address of MN configured from prefix P1 and
   another CN sends packets to address of MN configured from prefix P2,
   then multihoming benefits such as these said flows coming via all MN
   interfaces cannot be achieved.  Thus, some further work is required
   in this area.  For example, LMA/HA can identify using the NAI that
   both entries belong to the same MN.  But the MAGs are not aware of MN
   other interface prefixes.  Thus, if LMA/HA decides to send packets
   configured from P1 to MAG2, MAG2 will drop it.  If a MAG has
   knowledge of MN's other interface(interfaces not attached to MAG)
   prefixes, then definitely, MN can enjoy some advanced multihoming
   benefits.

           Figure 4: Horizontal Handoff in Multiple Prefix Model

   In Figure 4, it is assumed that MN has two interfaces.  MN can be an
   IPv6 host or MIPv6 host.  Initially, it is assumed that MN is
   connected to PMIPv6 network via If1 and If2 at MAG1 and MAG2
   respectively.  It is further assumed that MN.If1 is connected to 3G
   network and MN.If2 is connected to trusted WLAN network.  In trusted
   WLAN network, the AR will have the MAG functionality and more
   information on trusted WLAN can be found in [8].  It is further
   considered that MN while still connected to 3G network via MN.If1,
   performs a horizontal handoff for MN.If2.  Basically, MN.If2 will
   detach from MAG2 and attach at a new MAG3.  In such a scenario, the
   important thing is that the If-ID information in the PBU sent from
   MAG3 has to have If2-ID.  This interface ID is essential for LMA to
   allocate the correct prefix during horizontal handoff.  As discussed



Jeyatharan, et al.      Expires December 19, 2008              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM            June 2008


   previously in section 3, various mechanisms are available for MAG3 to
   obtain If-ID of MN.If2.  In the scenario shown in Figure 4, there is
   no big problem of getting this interface ID because MAG3 is the
   directly connected access router of MN and the MN.If2 MAC address can
   be readily obtained (assuming MAC address is used as MN If-ID).  The
   only danger in this scenario is that, if MAG3 does not have interface
   ID of If2 (for some reason) and it does not know the handoff state of
   MN, then it may set the handoff flag to "4" in the handoff indication
   option saying that the handoff is unknown.  In such a worst case
   scenario, the LMA may assign a new prefix for If2 and session
   continuity for prefix P2 flows will be disrupted.  Thus, these kind
   of issues needs to be prevented if multiple prefix model is deployed.
   The main concern is that if MAG3 does not know If2-ID, then getting
   this information quickly needs to be explored to prevent horizontal
   handoff establishment delay.  Alternatively, the handoff state has to
   be explicitly informed to MAG3.

   Another area to be explored is the handoff delay optimization.  As
   described in section 3, horizontal handoff delay can possibly be
   optimized using the stable 3G interface.  However, in the multiple
   prefix model to achieve this is more difficult because the prefix of
   the interface undergoing handoff needs to be informed via a trusted
   entity to the 3G MAG.  The LMA also needs to be informed to route
   packets for interface undergoing handoff via another interface.
   These signalings need to be done in a timely manner to achieve the
   benefits of handoff delay optimization.

   In Figure 5, it is assumed that MN has three interfaces, such as
   MN.If1, MN.If2 and MN.If3.  It is further assumed that initially MN
   has MN.If1 and MN.If2 connected to the PMIPv6 network.  Then, after
   some time, MN shuts down MN.If2 and attaches via MN.If3 -- i.e., MN
   performs a vertical handoff for MN.If2.  From 3GPP point of view,
   this is a very probable scenario where the MN is attached via 3G and
   WiMAX and when it detects WLAN may want to transfer the WiMAX flows
   to WLAN.  If such a vertical handoff is performed, then what is
   desired by vertical handoff from MN's point of view is that MN
   requires flows for prefix P2 to be sent via MN.If3.  To achieve this,
   the LMA should assign prefix P2 to MN.If3.  For LMA to process such
   vertical handoff request information and assign the desired prefix P2
   in the above scenario, the PBU sent by MAG3 need to have If2-ID in
   addition to If3-ID.  Moreover, as mentioned in [1], the handoff flag
   in the handoff indication option should specify that this is a
   vertical handoff.  Thus one can clearly see the complexity involved
   in getting the correct prefix for vertical handoff in the multiple
   prefix model.

   Let us consider another scenario where MN did not have MN.If1 but
   only had MN.If2 and MN.If3.  When MN performs a vertical handoff from
   MN.If2 to MN.If3, If2-ID may not be required in the PBU.  Once LMA
   sees the handoff flag pointing to "2" (vertical hand-off), it will
   assign P2 to MN.If3.  This is because LMA has no difficulty in
   identifying P2 cache since there are no other entries associated with
   MN.  Thus, one can appreciate that the vertical handoff complexity is
   high when MN has more than two interfaces.

   As highlighted previously, when MN does vertical handoff in a complex
   scenario as shown in Figure 5, MAG3 needs If2-ID information in the
   PBU.  The question is how such information can be obtained by MAG3.
   Suppose MAG3 is ePDG.  Then, as mentioned previously, MN can supply
   the If2-ID to MAG3.  Another option is that MAG3 can get it via
   context transfer from MAG2.  If vertical handoff is performed between
   heterogeneous access network types, context transfer via
   heterogeneous networks may take some time and other fast mechanisms
   may need to taken into consideration to prevent vertical handoff
   establishment delay.  In 3GPP inter access technology handoff can
   take place between home public land mobile network (HPLMN) and
   visited public land mobile network (VPLMN).  In such a case, getting
   the If-ID of the shutdown interface using purely network based
   mechanisms is not efficient and may not be possible.  Thus, some
   terminal involvement is definitely useful in this scenario.


5.  PMIPv6/CMIPv6 Interaction issues for Multihomed MN

   In this section, PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 interaction scenarios are analyzed

   for MuIf terminal and also for a single interface terminal that is
   capable of processing different prefixes as a result of being capable
   of multihoming.  In 3GPP SAE framework, the MN can select PMIPv6 or
   CMIPv6 (i.e.  Dual stack MIPv6) when connecting to a network of a
   particular access technology.  Thus, there are many scenarios where
   such heterogeneous mobility management mechanisms will be used for a
   MuIf terminal considering that a MN can be attached to home, foreign
   or simultaneously at home and foreign.  PMIPv6/CMIPv6 interaction
   issues for a single interface terminal can be found in the document
   [11].  However, for futuristic use cases in 3GPP where the MN is
   attached via multiple interfaces, these advanced scenarios need to be
   looked into in depth.

5.1.  Single Interface Processing Multiple Prefixes

   In this section, we look at a 3GPP specific scenario where the MN may
   possibly see its home and foreign prefixes via the same interface.
   Currently in 3GPP specifications, the mobility management mechanism
   for a MN is either network based or node based for a certain
   interface.  However, it is very probable that a MN will see home and
   foreign prefixes via the same interface if the MN wants both mobility
   management mechanisms such as PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 mechanism for the
   same interface.  In this section we look at specific multihoming
   related issues when the MN wants such dual mobility management
   mechanisms, in two different scenarios.  The first scenario is when
   MN is in the home domain or HPLMN and wants such dual mobility
   management operation.  The second scenario is when MN is in the
   foreign or VPLMN and wants such dual mobility management operation.

5.1.1.  PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 prefix processing at home domain

   In this section multihoming is analyzed from the perspective of
   multiple care-of addresses configured for a certain interface of MN
   when MN is in the HPLMN.  Furthermore, the analysis is performed in a
   system that uses single prefix multihoming model at LMA/HA.  We would
   like to highlight that the problem highlighted in this section is
   applicable even if LMA/HA deploys the multiple prefixes per MN model.

   Figure 6: Multihomed MN processing multiple addresses when PMIPv6 is
                             deployed in 3GPP

   In a 3GPP deployment that uses PMIPv6 protocol, there are many
   prefixes a particular interface of MN can receive especially if MN is
   connected to Untrusted WLAN.  MN may want to configure different
   addresses from different prefixes for various reasons.  In such a
   scenario shown in Figure 6, it is assumed that MN has multihoming
   support and can generate BIDs as in [6] and LMA/HA can support
   multihoming as well.  Generally, when an interface of MN configures
   different addresses, MN may prefer to have reachability to all such
   configured addresses from the LMA/HA to obtain multihoming benefits.
   It is also assumed that this PMIPv6 domain is MN's home PMIPv6 domain
   and MN home address (MONAMI6/MIPv6 sense) is equal to MN.If1 address.
   The mechanism by which MN gets the MIPv6 home address can be 3GPP



Jeyatharan, et al.      Expires December 19, 2008              [Page 21]

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM            June 2008


   specific or using dynamic bootstrapping mechanism.  In Figure 6, it
   is considered that MN.If1 is attached to 3G MAG1.  When MN attaches
   to PMIPv6 network, it is assumed that it connects first via MN.If1.
   When such a connection is successful, then the first entry in the BC
   will appear.  The If1-ID can be directly obtained by MAG1 assuming
   that the S-GW is the first hop router for the data plane.  If the
   data packet has to be routed via evolved node B (eNodeB) that also
   acts as a router as described in [12], then MAG1 may not be the first
   hop router.  It is further considered that MN.If2 is connected to
   PMIPv6/3GPP network via Untrusted WLAN access network.  MN.If2 is
   directly attached to AR/AP.  When MN.If2 makes a successful IPSec
   tunnel to ePDG as disclosed in [2], the second entry in the binding
   cache will be created.  Again, the If2-ID needs to be different from
   If1-ID to maintain simultaneous binding.  Before establishing a
   tunnel to ePDG, MN.If2 will get a nomadic address in the Untrusted
   WLAN access network and this nomadic address prefix is directly
   associated with AR's prefix.

   MN may configure another address from the home prefix (home2) for
   MN.If2 to get reachability or to set filter rules at LMA/HA without
   knowing that this is a PMIPv6 domain.  MN may want to register these
   addresses (nomadic address/on-link CoA, home2) at LMA/HA.  When MN
   performs multiple CoA binding at LMA/HA for home2 and on-link CoA,
   then these CMIPv6 registrations created at LMA/HA are as shown in the
   binding cache by the third and fourth entries respectively.  When MN
   does CMIPv6 registrations, the BIDs generated must be different from
   the PMIPv6 registrations.  If MN uses If2-ID value as BID1 or BID2,
   then one of the CMIPv6 binding may overwrite the second PMIPv6
   binding.  Thus, some MN involvement and some added multihoming
   feature is necessary at MN in this scenario to have the desired
   binding cache entries at LMA/HA.  Moreover, one can clearly see that
   when multiple PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 registrations are taking place at the
   common anchoring point, there is a signaling storm in the system
   although MN has only two physical interfaces.  Thus, further work is
   required to solve some issues that may arise in this scenario.
   Basically, these CMIPv6 registrations via If2 can be combined with
   the PMIPv6 registration ot reduce the signaling storm in the core
   network.

5.1.2.  PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 roaming issues for home routed 3GPP Scenario

   In this section we consider a scenario where both PMIPv6 and CMIPv6
   mobility management operations are performed when MN is in VPLMN.
   Such a scenario occurs when the MN is in VPLMN and gets the home
   prefix from home P-GW which is placed in the HPLMN and gets the
   foreign prefix obtained from P-GW placed in the VPLMN.  Basically,
   due to such simultaneous usage of home and foreign P-GWs, MN sees
   both home and foreign prefixes.  The assumption here is that MN

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM            June 2008


   considers the prefix given by home P-GW as the MIPv6 home prefix.
   Usually, from MIPv6 point of view, when a node sees the home and
   foreign prefixes via a certain interface it will not engage in
   mobility related signaling.  However, in the specific scenario, we
   assume that the MN can process foreign prefix although it sees home
   prefix and in that sense it is multihomed.

   Figure 7: Simultaneously at home and at foreign for home routed 3GPP

   The above scenario shown in Figure 7 is the 3GPP scenario where MN
   gets to see both home and foreign prefixes via the same interface.
   The scenario description was given previously.  MN is currently in
   VPLMN and connected to MAG which is placed in the WiMAX access
   network and the MAG functionality is collocated at the WiMAX access
   gateway (AGW).  It is further considered that the MAG and the P-GW at
   HPLMN is connected via logical interface s2a where the PMIPv6
   protocol is used for mobility management.  The routing path for data
   packets for home routed case (i.e. packets whose source address
   obtained from home P-GW) may be via the foreign P-GW.  When MN sees
   home and foreign prefixes, then the MAG would have performed the
   PMIPv6 signaling at home P-GW for this home prefix.  The binding
   entry created at the home P-GW is shown by the first entry in the BC.
   However, if MN wishes to use the foreign prefix to communicate with
   CN assuming that it gets some information from the network that the
   path attained using the foreign prefix to configure source address



Jeyatharan, et al.      Expires December 19, 2008              [Page 23]

   gives better QoS, then the MN will generally perform the CMIPv6 BU at
   LMA/HA or home P-GW such that it binds the care-of address obtained
   from foreign prefix to the home address configured from home prefix.
   This is shown by the second entry in the BC in Figure 7.  The second
   entry will overwrite the first entry.  It can be clearly seen that
   there is double signaling done (i.e. one by MAG and another by MN)
   for the same binding.  This problem needs to be solved.  MN could
   possibly decide to use the PMIPv6 binding created by MAG to get
   reachability for the home prefix and then only use the care-of
   address configured from foreign P-GW to communicate with CN directly
   (i.e. dual mobility management mode).  Another possible solution is
   that MN could request the MAG not to perform the PMIPv6 registration
   at home P-GW and also inform the MAG that it will handle the binding
   update to home P-GW and CN in a pure CMIPv6 mode.

   The problem described in this section is present irrespective of
   whether single prefix per MN or multiple prefixes per MN model is
   deployed in the system and it is applicable to both the models.

5.2.  MuIf MN PMIPv6/CMIPv6 roaming issues

   In this section, the focus is on analyzing the issues when a MuIf MN
   does a simultaneous attachment via heterogeneous mobility management
   modes such as PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 to the common anchoring point.  As
   described in [2], even when MN (assuming two interfaces) is in the
   HPLMN, the MN mobility management for the first interface can be
   performed via PMIPv6 mechanism and the mobility management for the
   second interface can be performed by CMIPv6 mechanism.  In 3GPP
   roaming scenarios where the MN moves away from HPLMN, there can be
   specific intermediate scenarios where the MN has one interface
   attached to home domain (HPLMN) and the other interface attached to
   foreign domain (VPLMN).  In such intermediate roaming scenarios also,
   MN may again be involved in different management mechanisms via its
   different interfaces.  In this section, such scenarios are analyzed
   and some issues are highlighted that definitely need some MN
   involvement and some modifications to PMIPv6 protocol to support
   simultaneous usage in a PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 mixed mobility management
   environment as considered in the 3GPP framework.

   Figure 8: MuIf MN attaching to HPLMN by using PMIPv6/CMIPv6 Mobility
                           Management mechanisms

   This scenario as shown in Figure 8 is a 3GPP specific scenario, where
   MN chooses CMIPv6 mobility management to be used via the 3G interface
   (MN.If1) and PMIPv6 mobility management via the WLAN interface.
   Basically, MN will use the on-link prefix that is available in the 3G
   access network advertised by eNodeB or advertised by S-GW which is
   placed in the core network to configure a care-of address.  The said
   on-link prefix will be topologically rooted at the eNodeB or the
   S-GW.  MN will perform the CMIPv6 BU at LMA/HA binding the home
   address to the care-of address configured using the on-link prefix.
   When MN performs such CMIPv6 BU at the LMA/HA, the binding created is
   shown by the first entry in the cache.  It is further considered that
   the home address is obtained from a prefix that is topologically
   rooted at the home P-GW.  It is assumed that MN is attached to WLAN
   access via its second interface and chooses PMIPv6 mobility
   management mechanism to manage mobility for this interface.  It is
   further assumed that MN sees the same home prefix when MAG2 performs
   the PMIPv6 binding at the LMA/HA.  To maintain such simultaneous
   attachment, the PBU sent by MAG2 needs to have some If-ID or BID2
   that is different from BID1.  The mechanism by which MAG2 gets to
   know the correct value for BID2 needs to be supported by the system.
   Otherwise, MAG2 may use a BID that is of same value as BID1 and may
   overwrite the CMIPv6 entry and delete the reachability to cellular
   interface.  There can be many mechanisms by which this problem can be
   solved.  For example, MAG2 may be informed by MN that it is
   performing simultaneous attachment so that the MAG2 may query the
   LMA/HA about interface 1 BID1 and then perform the PBU at LMA/HA with
   a BID that is different from BID1.  Alternatively, MAG2 may request



Jeyatharan, et al.      Expires December 19, 2008              [Page 25]

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM            June 2008


   the LMA/HA to generate the BID that is different from BID1.  For MAG2
   to make such a request it needs to know that MN other interface is
   attached to the LMA/HA and this information needs to be given by MN.
   Another possible solution can be that MN gives BID2 to ePDG/MAG2,
   where BID2 is different from BID1, so that MAG2 can create the
   correct PMIPv6 binding for interface 2 so that simultaneous binding
   using CMIPv6 and PMIPv6 can be obtained.  The problem and solution
   described in this section is applicable to either PMIPv6 multihoming
   models (i.e. the single prefix per MN and multiple prefixes per MN
   model).

   In another alternate scenario, if only the MN's WLAN interface in
   Figure 8 moves out of the home domain to a VPLMN and decides to
   switch to CMIPv6 mode, it needs to know the BID generated by LMA/HA
   for interface 2, in the event this BID2 was not provided by MN.  If
   MN uses a BID when performing CMIPv6 BU for interface 2 that is
   different from BID2 that was created previously, then there is a
   possibility for three bindings to exist at home P-GW.  Such as the
   interface 1 CMIPv6 binding, interface 2 PMIPv6 old binding and the
   interface 2 correct CMIPv6 binding.  It is important to understand
   that since the interface 2 PMIPv6 prefix and the home address prefix
   are the same, only when the BIDs are the same the old PMIPv6 entry
   can be overwritten by the new CMIPv6 entry for the same interface.
   Ideally, the second binding entry shown in Figure 8 should have been
   overwritten by the CMIPv6 binding for interface 2 due to roaming.  If
   interface 2 current binding does not overwrite the old PMIPv6 binding
   for interface 2, packet loss can take place if the LMA/HA decides to
   route packets using the second entry in BC shown in Figure 8.
   However, if MAG2 can detect MN detachment fast enough, then possibly
   it may send a deregistration PBU and solve the above said issue.
   However, in the most general case, there needs to be a way where MN
   gets the BID2 value before performing the CMIPv6 binding.

5.3.  MuIf MN PMIP/CMIP signaling optimization

   In this section, we consider a signaling optimization that can be
   performed in multiple interface case when one of the interface
   performs the CMIPv6 BU and the other interface performs the PMIPv6
   BU.  To further understand the optimization issue we again consider
   Figure 8.  If for example, MN's interface 2 does the initial
   attachment to the HPLMN, there is no necessity for the MN to know the
   home P-GW address.  However, since MN's interface 1 is in the CMIPv6
   state, then it needs to know the home P-GW address in order to
   perform the CMIPv6 BU.  Basically, the CMIPv6 BU can be broken into
   steps such as bootstrapping to identify the HA address and then
   performing the CMIPv6 BU.  To optimize the bootstrapping signaling
   part, if MN knows that the PMIPv6 binding is via HPLMN, then it can
   possibly configure the care-of address for interface 1 and perform

   the CMIPv6 BU via the interface 2.  In such a case, the discovery for
   home agent address need not be performed because, the MAG2 knows the
   address of home P-GW.  The MN possibly can trigger MAG2 and request
   the MAG2 to perform the CMIPv6 binding.  The MN needs to give the
   CMIPv6 binding contents to MAG2 so that PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 signaling
   optimization can be achieved.  Such signaling optimization issues
   needs to be identified for PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 interaction scenarios.
   again we would like to highlight that the issue described in this
   section is applicable for both PMIPv6 multihoming models(i.e. single
   prefix and multiple prefixes)


6.  Conclusion

   In this memo, various issues that needs to be addressed when
   multihoming is supported in the PMIPv6 domain was analyzed.  Issues
   were analyzed for single and multiple prefix models seperately.  MuIf
   PMIP/CMIP related issues that are common to both the models were
   analyzed seperately.  From the analysis as highlighted in the draft,
   irrespective of the model used, some further work is required to
   solve issues in: simultaneous attachment, flow filtering, horizontal
   and vertical hand-offs and PMIPv6/CMIPv6 related issues.  Finally, we
   would like to conclude that multihoming can be provided by either
   PMIPv6 multihoming models.  However, how these models are going to be
   used to achieve advanced multihoming benefits needs further work.
   Whether network based solutions or some terminal involvement deemed
   necessary has to be analyzed for each of the problem scenario that
   was highlighted in the memo.  Considering that the PMIPv6 protocol is
   designed with the objective of reducing the signaling from MN, we
   suggest that solution space analysis for these problems should
   consider solutions where MN involvement is minimal.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This is an informational document and does not require any IANA
   action.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document explores the problem of supporting mobile nodes with
   multiple interfaces connecting to a PMIPv6 domain.  No additional
   security threat is identified as of the writing of this memo that is
   specific to multiple interfaces support.

              Figure 9: Simultaneously at home and at foreign

   In this section some issues associated with MN when it roaming away
   from home domain is analyzed.  In Figure 9, it is assumed that MN can
   be a MONAMI6 node.  It is assumed that MN.If1 is attached to home
   domain, which is also a PMIPv6 domain.  The entry created at LMA/HA
   due to MN.If1 attachment is shown by the first entry.  If MN.If2 is
   attached to foreign domain, MN will configure a CoA for MN.If2 and
   will want to send a CMIPv6 binding to LMA/HA either using a "H" flag
   or will send a CMIPv6 binding using BID2 in the binding update.  If
   such an action is performed by MONAMI6 MN, then the binding cache
   created is shown by the second entry.  The important point here is
   that, if 'H" flag is used, then there is no problem because both MN
   interfaces reachability states are available at LMA/HA.  However, if
   MONAMI6 nodes decides to put BID2, instead of "H" flag, and if BID2
   sent in CMIPv6 BU is same as If1-ID, then there is a danger of
   overwriting the first PMIPv6 entry and thus loosing the simultaneous
   at home and away benefits.  Furthermore, if MN is a MIPv6 node in
   Figure 9, then MN may not insert BID or "H" flag in CMIPv6 BU and
   this CMIPv6 BU will overwrite the first PMIPv6 PBU and multihoming
   benefits will be lost.

   If multiple prefix model is active in the scenario shown in Figure 9,
   then such a roaming scenario does not pose any issue for a MIPv6 host
   that has two home addresses (one for each interface configured from 2
   different home prefixes).  This is because, the first entry in BCE
   will have P1 prefix (PMIPv6 entry) and the second entry will have a
   CMIPv6 entry tying MN HoA(configured from P2 prefix) to a care-of
   address configured in foreign domain.  Thus, the caches from both
   interfaces are clearly separated by means of prefixes.  In this
   multiple prefix roaming case, If-ID need not be attached in the
   CMIPv6 BU to separate the bindings.  Thus, roaming is not a issue for
   an unmodified MIPv6 host.


Appendix C.  Multihoming Issues in Multiple LMA Scenario

   If there are multiple LMAs in the same PMIPv6 network, then there is
   a possibility that a MN sees multiple prefixes being received at the
   same interface.  In this section this scenario is briefly analyzed to
   see whether multihoming issue is present.  Again, it is assumed that
   MN and HA have MONAMI6 functionality.

                Figure 10: PMIPv6 domain with multiple LMAs

   Figure 10 shows a scenario where MN is attached to a foreign PMIPv6
   domain with multiple LMAs.  Here, MN may receive two per-MN unique
   prefixes (LMA1pref and LMA2pref) and configure two care-of addresses
   using these prefixes.  As MN is MONAMI6 capable, it will assign
   different BID for each of the care-of addresses when binding them to
   its home address at its home agent HA.  The binding caches of the
   LMAs and the HA are shown in Figure 10.  In this case, MN can enjoy
   multioming benefits.
