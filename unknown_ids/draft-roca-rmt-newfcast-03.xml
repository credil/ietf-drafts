    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document introduces the FCAST reliable and scalable object
      (e.g., file) delivery application. Two versions of FCAST exist: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>FCAST/ALC that relies on the Asynchronous Layer Coding (ALC)
          <xref target="RMT-PI-ALC"></xref> and the Layered Coding Transport
          (LCT) <xref target="RMT-BB-LCT"></xref> reliable multicast transport
          protocol, and</t>

          <t>FCAST/NORM that relies on the NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast
          (NORM) <xref target="RMT-PI-NORM"></xref> reliable multicast
          transport protocol.</t>
        </list> Hereafter, the term FCAST denotes either FCAST/ALC or
      FCAST/NORM.</t>

      <t>Depending on the target use case, the delivery service provided by
      FCAST is more or less reliable. For instance, with FCAST/ALC used in
      ON-DEMAND mode over a time period that largely exceeds the typical
      download time, the service can be considered as fully reliable.
      Similarly, when FCAST is used along with a session control application
      that collects reception information and takes appropriate corrective
      measures (e.g., a direct point-to-point retransmission of missing
      packets, or a new multicast recovery session), then the service can be considered
      as fully reliable. On the opposite, if FCAST operates in PUSH mode, then
      the service is usually only partially reliable, and a receiver that is
      disconnected during a sufficient time will perhaps not have the
      possibility to download the object.</t>

      <t>Depending on the target use case, the FCAST scalability is more or
      less important. For instance, if FCAST/ALC is used on top of purely
      unidirectional transport channels, with no feedback information at all,
      which is the default mode of operation, then the scalability is maximum
      since neither FCAST, nor ALC, UDP or IP generates any feedback message.
      On the opposite, the FCAST/NORM scalability is typically limited by NORM
      scalability itself. Similarly, if FCAST is used along with a session
      control application that collects reception information from the
      receivers, then this session control application limits the scalability
      of the global object delivery system. This situation can of course be
      mitigated by using a hierarchy of feedback message aggregators or
      servers. The details of this is out of the scope of the present
      document.</t>

      <t>A design goal behind FCAST is to define a streamlined solution, in
      order to enable lightweight implementations of the protocol stack, and
      limit the operational processing and storage requirements. A consequence
      of this choice is that FCAST cannot be considered as a versatile
      application, capable of addressing all the possible use-cases. On the
      opposite, FCAST has some intrinsic limitations. From this point of view
      it differs from FLUTE <xref target="RMT-FLUTE"></xref> which favors
      flexibility at the expense of some additional complexity.</t>

      <t>A good example of the design choices meant to favor the
      simplicitly is the way FCAST manages the object meta-data: by default,
      the meta-data and the object content are sent together, in a compound
      object. This solution has many advantages in terms of simplicity as will
      be described later on.
      However, as such, it also has an intrinsic limitation since it does not enable
      a receiver to decide in advance, before beginning the reception of the
      compound object, whether the object is of interest or not, based on the
      information that may be provided in the meta-data.
      Therefore this document defines additional techniques that may be used
      to mitigate this limitation.
      It is also possible that some use-cases require that each receiver
      download the whole set of objects sent in the session (e.g., with
      mirroring tools). When this is the case, the above limitation is no
      longer be a problem.</t>

      <section anchor="applicability" title="Applicability">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>FCAST is compatible with any congestion control protocol designed
        for ALC/LCT or NORM. However, depending on the use-case, the data flow
        generated by the FCAST application might not be constant, but instead
        be bursty in nature. Similarly, depending on the use-case, an FCAST
        session might be very short. Whether and how this will impact the
        congestion control protocol is out of the scope of the present
        document.</t>

        <t>FCAST is compatible with any security mechanism designed for
        ALC/LCT or NORM. The use of a security scheme is strongly RECOMMENDED
        (see <xref target="security"></xref>).</t>

        <t>FCAST is compatible with any FEC scheme designed for ALC/LCT or
        NORM. Whether FEC is used or not, and the kind of FEC scheme used, is
        to some extent transparent to FCAST.</t>

        <t>FCAST is compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6. Nothing in the FCAST
        specification has any implication on the source or destination IP
        address.</t>

      <section title="Definitions">
        <!-- ==================== -->

        <t>This document uses the following definitions: <list style="empty">
            <t>FCAST/ALC denotes the FCAST application running on top of the
            ALC/LCT reliable transport protocol;</t>

            <t>FCAST/NORM denotes the FCAST application running on top of the
            NORM reliable transport protocol;</t>

            <t>FCAST denotes either FCAST/ALC or FCAST/NORM;</t>

            <t>Compound Object denotes an ALC or NORM transport object
            composed of the Compound Object Header <xref
            target="header_format"></xref>, including any meta-data and the
            content of the original application object (e.g., a file);</t>

            <t>Carousel denotes the compound object transmission system of an
            FCAST sender;</t>

            <t>Carousel Instance denotes a fixed set of registered compound
            objects that are sent by the carousel during a certain number of
            cycles. Whenever compound objects need to be added or removed, a
            new Carousel Instance is defined;</t>

            <t>Carousel Instance Object (CIO) denotes a specific object that
            lists the compound objects that comprise a given carousel
            instance;</t>

            <t>Carousel Cycle denotes a transmission round within which all
            the compound objects registered in the Carousel Instance are
            transmitted a certain number of times. By default, compound
            objects are transmitted once per cycle, but higher values are
            possible, that might differ on a per-object basis;</t>

            <t>The Transmission Object Identifier (TOI) refers the numeric
            identifier associated to a specific object by the underlying
            transport layer. In the case of ALC, this corresponds to the TOI
            described in that specification while for the NORM specification
            this corresponds to the NormObjectId described there.</t>

      <!-- ==================================== -->

      <section anchor="fcast_service" title="FCAST Content Delivery Service">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The basic goal of FCAST is to transmit objects to a group of
        receivers in a reliable way. The receiver set MAY be restricted to a
        single receiver or MAY include possibly a very large number of
        receivers. FCAST is specified to support two forms of operation.<list
            style="numbers">
            <t>FCAST/ALC: where the FCAST application is meant to run on top
            of the ALC/LCT reliable multicast transport protocol, and</t>

            <t>FCAST/NORM: where the FCAST application is meant to run on top
            of the NORM reliable multicast transport protocol.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>This specification is designed such that both forms of operation
        share as much commonality as possible.</t>

        <t>While the choice of the underlying transport protocol (i.e., ALC or
        NORM) and its parameters may limit the practical receiver group size,
        nothing in FCAST itself limits it. The transmission might be fully
        reliable, or only partially reliable depending upon the way ALC or
        NORM is used (e.g., whether FEC encoding and/or NACK-based repair
        requests are used or not), the way the FCAST carousel is used (e.g.,
        whether the objects are made available for a long time span or not),
        and the way in which FCAST itself is employed (e.g., whether there is
        a session control application that might automatically extend an
        existing FCAST session until all receivers have received the
        transmitted content).</t>

        <t>FCAST is designed to be as self-sufficient as possible, in
        particular in the way object meta-data is attached to object data
        content. However, for some uses, meta-data MAY also be communicated by
        an out-of-band mechanism that is out of the scope of the present
        document.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="meta-data_tx" title="Meta-Data Transmission">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>FCAST usually carries meta-data elements by prepending them to the
        object it refers to. As a result, a compound object is created that is
        composed of a header followed by the original object content. This
        header is itself composed of the meta-data as well as several fields,
        for instance to indicate the boundaries between the various parts of
        this compound object.</t>

        <t>Attaching the meta-data to the object is an efficient solution,
        since it guaranties that meta-data be received along with the
        associated object, and it allows the transport of the meta-data to
        benefit from any transport-layer FEC erasure protection of the
        compound object. However a limit of this scheme, as such, is that a
        client does not know the meta-data of an object before it begins
        receiving the object and perhaps not until decoding the object
        completely depending upon the transport protocol used and its
        particular FEC code type and parameters.</t>

        <t>However, this solution can be associated to another in-band (e.g.,
        via NORM INFO messages, <xref target="norm_specifics"></xref>) or
        out-of-band signaling mechanism in order to carry the whole
        meta-data (or a subset of it) possibly ahead of time.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="meta-data_content" title="Meta-Data Content">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The meta-data associated to an object can be composed of, but are
        not limited to: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Content-Location: the URI of the object, which gives the name
            and location of the object;</t>

            <t>Content-Type: the MIME type of the object;</t>

            <t>Content-Length: the size of the initial object, before any
            content encoding (if any). Note that this content length does not
            include the meta-data nor the header of the compound object;</t>

            <t>Content-Encoding: the optional encoding of the object performed
            by FCAST;</t>

            <!--
   <t> the size of the object after the optional encoding performed by FCAST; </t>
   <t> a timestamp associated to this object; </t>
   <t> Expires: the time validity of the object, after which the object is considered
	as out-of-date; </t>
	-->

            <t>Content-MD5: the MD5 message digest of the object in order to
            check its integrity. Note that this digest is meant to protect
            from transmission and processing errors, not from deliberate
            attacks by an intelligent attacker. Note also that this digest
            only protects the object, not the header, and therefore not the
            meta-data;</t>

            <t>a digital signature for this object;</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>This list is not limited and new meta-data information can be
        added. For instance, when dealing with very large objects (e.g., that
        largely exceed the working memory of a receiver), it can be
        interesting to split this object into several sub-objects. When a file
        is split into several objects by FCAST, the meta-data includes: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Fcast_Obj_Slice_Nb: the total number of slices. A value
            strictly greater than 1 indicates that this object is the result
            of a split of the original object;</t>

            <t>Fcast_Obj_Slice_Idx: the slice index (in the [0 .. SliceNb[
            interval);</t>

            <t>Fcast_Obj_Slice_Offset: the offset at which this slice starts
            within the original object;</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>When meta-data elements are communicated out-of-band, in advance of
        data transmission, the following pieces of information may also be
        useful: <list style="symbols">
            <t>TOI: the Transmission Object Identifier (TOI) of the object
            (<xref target="object_id"></xref>), in
            order to enable a receiver to easily associate the meta-data to
            the object for which he receives packets;</t>

            <t>FEC Object Transmission Information (FEC OTI). In this case the
            FCAST sender does not need to use the optional EXT_FTI mechanism
            of ALC or NORM protocols.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="carousel" title="Carousel Transmission">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>A set of FCAST compound objects scheduled for transmission are
        considered a logical "Carousel". A single "Carousel Instance" is
        comprised of a fixed set of compound objects. Whenever the FCAST
        application needs to add new compound objects to or remove old
        compound objects from the transmission set, a new Carousel Instance
        is defined since the set of compound objects changes.</t>

        <t>For a given Carousel Instance, one or more transmission cycles are
        possible. During each cycle, all of the compound objects comprising
        the Carousel are sent. By default, each object is transmitted once per
        cycle. However, in order to allow different levels of priority, some
        objects MAY be transmitted more often that others during a cycle,
        and/or benefit from higher FEC protection than others. This can be the
        case for instance of the CIO objects (<xref target="cio"></xref>). For
        some FCAST usage (e.g., a unidirectional "push" mode), a Carousel
        Instance may be associated to a single transmission cycle. In other cases
        it may be associated to a large number of transmission cycles (e.g., in
        "on-demand" mode, where objects are made available for download during
        a long period of time).</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="cio" title="Carousel Instance Object">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The FCAST sender CAN transmit an OPTIONAL Carousel Instance Object
        (CIO). The CIO carries the list of the compound objects that are part of
        a given Carousel Instance, by specifying their
        respective Transmission Object Identifiers (TOI). However the CIO does
        not describe the objects themselves (i.e., there is no meta-data).
        Additionally, the CIO includes a "Complete" flag that is used to
        indicate that no further modification to the enclosed list will be done
        in the future. Finally, the CIO includes a Carousel Instance ID that
        identifies the Carousel Instance it pertains to.</t>

        <t> There is no reserved TOI value for the CIO itself, since this object
        is regarded by ALC/LCT or NORM as a standard object. On the opposite,
        the nature of this object (CIO) is indicated by means of a specific
        compound object header field (the "I" flag) so that it can be recognized
        and processed by the FCAST
        application as needed. A direct consequence is the following: since a
        receiver does not know in advance which TOI will be used for the following
        CIO (i.e., with dynamic sessions), he MUST NOT filter out packets that
        are not in the CIO's TOI list. Said differently, the goal of CIO is not
        to setup ALC or NORM packet filters (this mechanism would not be secure
        in any case).</t>

        <t>The use of a CIO remains optional. If it is not used, then the
        clients progressively learn what files are part of the carousel
        instance by receiving ALC or NORM packets with new TOIs. However using
        a CIO has several benefits:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>When the "Complete" flag is set (if ever), the receivers know
            when they can leave the session, i.e., when they have received all
            the objects that are part of the delivery session;</t>

            <t>In case of a session with a dynamic set of objects, the sender
            can reliably inform the receivers that some objects have been
            removed from the carousel with the CIO. This solution is more
            robust than the "Close Object flag (B)" of ALC/LCT since a client
            with an intermittent connectivity might loose all the packets
            containing this B flag. And while NORM provides a robust object
            cancellation mechanism in the form of its NORM_CMD(SQUELCH)
            message in response to receiver NACK repair requests, the use of
            the CIO provides an additional means for receivers to learn of
            objects for which it is futile to request repair;</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
        During idle periods, when the carousel instance does not contain
        any object, a CIO with an empty TOI list MAY be transmitted.
        In that case, a new carousel instance ID MUST be used to differentiate
        this (empty) carousel instance from the other ones.
        This mechanism can be useful to inform the receivers that:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>all the previously sent
            objects have been removed from the carousel. It therefore
            improves the FCAST robustness even during "idle" period;</t>

            <t>the session is still active even
            if there is currently no content being sent. Said differently,
            it can be used as a heartbeat mechanism.
            If the "Complete" flag has not been set, it implicity informs
            the receivers that new objects may be sent in the future;</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>The decisions of whether a CIO should be used or not, how often
        and when a CIO should be sent, are left to the sender and depend on many
        parameters, including the target use case and the session dynamics.
        For instance it may be appropriate to send a CIO at the beginning of
        each new carousel instance, and then periodically. These
        operational aspects are out of the scope of the present document.</t>
      </section>


      <section anchor="object_id" title="Compound Object Identification">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The FCAST compound objects are directly associated with the object-based
        transport service that the ALC and NORM protocols provide. In each of
        these protocols, the messages containing transport object content are
        labeled with a numeric transport object identifier (i.e., the ALC TOI
        and the NORM <spanx style="emph">NormTransportId</spanx>). For
        purposes of this document, this identifier in either case (ALC or
        NORM) is referred to as the TOI.
        <!--
        The FCAST Compound Object Header
        meta-data can include an attribute that identifies the given object's
        TOI. Additionally, the CIO lists objects for the applicable Carousel
        Instance by using the TOI.
        -->
        </t>

        <t>
        There are several differences between ALC and NORM:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>the ALC use of TOI is rather flexible, since several TOI
            field sizes are possible (from 16 to 112 bits), this size can
            be changed at any time, on a per-packet basis, and their management
            is totally free as long as each object is associated to a unique
            TOI (if no wraparound happened);</t>
            <t>the NORM use of TOI is more directive, since the TOI field 
            is 16 bits long and TOIs MUST be managed sequentially;</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>In both NORM and ALC, it is possible that the transport
        identification space may eventually wrap for long-lived sessions
        (especially with NORM where this phenomenon is expected to happen
        more frequently).
        This can possibly introduce some ambiguity in FCAST object
        identification if a sender retains some older objects in newer
        Carousel Instances with updated object sets. Thus, when an updated
        object set for a new Carousel Instance transport identifiers that
        exceed one-half of the TOI sequence space (or otherwise exceed the
        sender repair window capability in the case of NORM) it may be
        necessary to re-enqueue old objects within the Carousel with new TOI
        to stay within transport identifier limits. To allow receivers to
        properly combine new transport symbols for any older objects with
        newly-assigned TOIs to achieve reliable transfer, a mechanism is
        required to equate the object(s) with new TOI with the older object
        TOI.</t>


        <t><list style="empty">
            <t><spanx style="emph">*** Editor's note:
            This mechanism is TBD. Two complementary possibilities are:
            (1) if the meta-data are processed rapidly (e.g., by using
            NORM-INFO messages), a receiver quickly detects that both
            objects are the same and take appropriate measures; 
            (2) we can also add a way, in the CIO, to say that
            {TOI, current CI} == {prev_TOI, prev CI}.

        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>There are no additional detail or option for FCAST/ALC
        operation.</t>
      </section>


      <section anchor="norm_specifics"
               title="FCAST/NORM Additional Specificities">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The NORM Protocol provides a few additional capabilities that can
        be used to specifically support FCAST operation:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The NORM_INFO message for conveying "out-of-band" content with
            respect to a given transport object MAY be used to provide the
            compound object header, and in particular the object meta-data,
            to the receivers.
            Note that the availability of NORM_INFO for a given object is signaled
            through the use of a dedicated flag in the NORM_DATA message header.
            Additionally, NORM's NACK-based repair request signaling allows
            a receiver to request separately and quickly an object's NORM_INFO
            content.
            <!--
            (that is typically encoded using FEC).
            -->
            However, the limitation here is that the Compound
            Object Header and its meta-data MUST fit within the byte size
            limit defined by the NORM sender's configured "segment size"
            (typically a little less than the network MTU);</t>

            <t>The NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) messages are used by the NORM protocol
            sender to inform receivers of objects that have been canceled when
            receivers make repair requests for such invalid objects.
            Along with the CIO mechanism, a receiver has an efficient and
            reliable way to discover old objects that have been removed from the
            carousel instance;
            </t>

            <t>NORM also supports an optional positive acknowledgment
            mechanism that can be used for small-scale multicast receiver
            group sizes. Also, it may be possible in some cases for the sender
            to infer, after some period without receiving NACKs at the end of
            its transmission that the receiver set has fully received the
            transmitted content. In particular, if the sender completes its
            end-of-transmission series of NORM_CMD(FLUSH) messages without
            receiving repair requests from the group, it may have some
            assurance that the receiver set has received the content prior to
            that point. These mechanisms are likely to help FCAST in achieving
            fully reliable transmissions;</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>
        When NORM_INFO is used with FCAST/NORM, the NORM_INFO content MUST
        contain the FCAST Compound Object Header and meta-data for that
        object, or a subset of the meta-data.
        In this case, the compound object sent in the regular NORM_DATA packets
        MAY be streamlined in order to contain no meta-data at all, or only the
        subset of the meta-data that is not carried in the NORM_INFO message.
        </t>

        <!--
        <t>Receivers automatically learn of the availability of NORM_INFO for
        a given object from a flag in the NORM_DATA message header. When
        NORM_INFO is used for FCAST/NORM operation, the NORM_INFO content MUST
        contain the FCAST Compound Object Header and meta-data for that
        object. In this case, the data content portion of the NORM transport
        object is the original application object. When NORM_INFO is not used
        for a given sender object (i.e., the corresponding NORM_DATA header
        flag is not set), the NORM transport object data content sent MUST
        contain the FCAST Compound Object Header unless this information is
        signaled by another means (out of scope of this document) prior to the
        carousel transmission.</t>
        -->

        <t>It should also be noted that the NORM_INFO message header may carry
        the EXT_FTI extension. The reliable delivery of the NORM_INFO content
        allows the individual objects' FEC Transmission Information to be
        provided to the receivers without burdening every packet (i.e.
        NORM_DATA messages) with this additional, but important, content.
        Examples are provided in <xref target="fcast_exple"></xref>.

      <section anchor="sender_behavior" title="FCAST Sender Behavior">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The following operations take place at a sender: <list
            style="numbers">
            <t>The user (or another application) selects a set of objects
            (e.g., files) to deliver and submits them, along with their
            meta-data, to the FCAST application;
            <!--
            The user MAY also specify how many times each object
            should be sent in this carousel instance during a cycle (by default,
            each object will be sent once). Said differently, if
            objects have similar lengths, assigning them a different number of
            transmissions leads to define different transmission priorities to
            each of them;
            -->
            </t>

            <t>For each object, FCAST creates the compound object and
            registers this latter in the carousel instance.</t>

            <t>The user then informs FCAST when all the objects of the set
            have been submitted. If the user knows that no new object will
            be submitted in the future (i.e., if the session's content is now
            complete), the user informs FCAST.
            Finally, the user specifies how many transmission cycles are
            desired (this number may be infinite);</t>

            <t>At this point, the FCAST application knows the full list of
            compound objects that are part of the carousel instance and can
            create a CIO if desired, possibly with the complete flag set;
            </t>
            <t>
            The FCAST application can now define a transmission schedule of
            these compound objects, including the optional CIO(s).
            This schedule defines in which order the packets of the various
            compound objects should be sent.
            This document does not specify any scheme. This is left to the
            developer within the provisions of the underlying ALC or NORM
            protocol used and the knowledge of the target use-case.</t>

            <t>The FCAST application then starts the carousel transmission,
            for the number of cycles specified. Transmissions take
            place until: <list

                <t>the user wants to prematurely stop the transmissions,
                or</t>

                <t>the user wants to add one or several new objects to the
                carousel, or on the opposite wants to remove old objects from
                the carousel. In that case a new carousel instance must be
                created.</t>

            (which may happen before receiving the entire object with some
            ALC/NORM transport configurations), the receiver processes the

            or not;</t>

            <t>When a compound object has been entirely received, the receiver
            processes the header, retrieves the object meta-data, perhaps
            decodes the meta-data, and processes the object accordingly;</t>

            <t>When a CIO is received, which is indicated by the 'I' flag set

          <t>Access control to the object being transmitted is typically
          provided by means of encryption. This encryption can be done over

          solutions be used.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="obj_corruption" title="Object Corruption">
          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>Protection against corruptions (e.g., in case of forged packets)
          is achieved by means of a content integrity verification/sender
          authentication scheme. This service can be provided at the object
          level, but in that case a receiver has no way to identify which
          symbol(s) is(are) corrupted if the object is detected as corrupted.
          This service can also be provided at the packet level. In this case,
          after removing all corrupted packets, the file may be in some cases
          recovered. Several techniques can provide this content
          integrity/sender authentication service: <list style="symbols">
              <t>at the object level, the object can be digitally signed (with
              public key cryptography), for instance by using
              RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 <xref target="RFC3447"></xref>. This signature
              enables a receiver to check the object integrity, once this
              latter has been fully decoded. Even if digital signatures are
              computationally expensive, this calculation occurs only once per
              object, which is usually acceptable;</t>

              <t>at the packet level, each packet can be digitally signed. A
              major limitation is the high computational and transmission
              overheads that this solution requires (unless perhaps if
              Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is used). To avoid this
              problem, the signature may span a set of packets (instead of a
              single one) in order to amortize the signature calculation. But
              if a single packets is missing, the integrity of the whole set
              cannot be checked;</t>

              <t>at the packet level, a Group Message Authentication Code
              (MAC) <xref target="RFC2104"></xref> scheme can be used, for
              instance by using HMAC-SHA-1 with a secret key shared by all the
              group members, senders and receivers. This technique creates a
              cryptographically secured digest of a packet that is sent along
              with the packet. The Group MAC scheme does not create
              prohibitive processing load nor transmission overhead, but it
              has a major limitation: it only provides a group
              authentication/integrity service since all group members share
              the same secret group key, which means that each member can send
              a forged packet. It is therefore restricted to situations where
              group members are fully trusted (or in association with another
              technique as a pre-check);</t>

              <t>at the packet level, Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant
              Authentication (TESLA) <xref target="RFC4082"></xref> is an
              attractive solution that is robust to losses, provides a true
              authentication/integrity service, and does not create any
              prohibitive processing load or transmission overhead. Yet
              checking a packet requires a small delay (a second or more)
              after its reception;</t>

              <t>at the packet level, IPSec/AH <xref target="RFC4302"></xref>
              (possibly associated to IPSec/ ESP) can be used to protect all
              the packets being exchanged in a session.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Techniques relying on public key cryptography (digital signatures
          and TESLA during the bootstrap process, when used) require that
          public keys be securely associated to the entities. This can be
          achieved by a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), or by a PGP Web of
          Trust, or by pre-distributing securely the public keys of each group
          member.</t>

          <t>Techniques relying on symmetric key cryptography (Group MAC)
          require that a secret key be shared by all group members. This can
          be achieved by means of a group key management protocol, or simply
          by pre-distributing securely the secret key (but this manual
          solution has many limitations).</t>

          <t>It is up to the developer and deployer, who know the security
          requirements and features of the target application area, to define
          which solution is the most appropriate. In any case, whenever there
          is any concern of the threat of file corruption, it is RECOMMENDED
          that at least one of these techniques be used.</t>

        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>Let us now consider attacks against the session control parameters
        and the associated building blocks. The attacker has at least the
        following opportunities to launch an attack: <list style="symbols">
            <t>the attack can target the session description,</t>

            <t>the attack can target the FCAST CIO,</t>

            <t>the attack can target the ALC/LCT parameters, carried within
            the LCT header or</t>

            <t>the attack can target the FCAST associated building blocks.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The latter one is particularly true with the multiple rate
        congestion control protocol which may be required.</t>

        <t>The consequences of these attacks are potentially serious, since
        they can compromise the behavior of content delivery system or even
        compromise the network itself.</t>

        <section anchor="attack_against_sdp"
                 title="Attacks Against the Session Description">
          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>An FCAST receiver may potentially obtain an incorrect Session
          Description for the session. The consequence of this is that
          legitimate receivers with the wrong Session Description are unable
          to correctly receive the session content, or that receivers
          inadvertently try to receive at a much higher rate than they are
          capable of, thereby possibly disrupting other traffic in the
          network.</t>

          <t>To avoid these problems, it is RECOMMENDED that measures be taken
          to prevent receivers from accepting incorrect Session Descriptions.
          One such measure is the sender authentication to ensure that
          receivers only accept legitimate Session Descriptions from
          authorized senders. How these measures are archived is outside the
          scope of this document since this session description is usually
          carried out-of-band.</t>

          <t>Corrupting the FCAST CIO is one way to create a Denial of Service
          attack. For example, the attacker removes legitimate object TOIs
          from the list.</t>

          <t>It is therefore RECOMMENDED that measures be taken to guarantee
          the integrity and to check the sender's identity of the CIO. To that
          purpose, one of the counter-measures mentioned above (<xref
          target="obj_corruption"></xref>) SHOULD be used. These measures will
          either be applied on a packet level, or globally over the whole CIO
          object. When there is no packet level integrity verification scheme,
          it is RECOMMENDED to digitally sign the CIO.</t>

        <section anchor="attack_against_meta_data"
                 title="Attacks Against the Object Meta-Data">
          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>Corrupting the object meta-data is another way to create a Denial
          of Service attack. For example, the attacker changes the MD5 sum
          associated to a file. This possibly leads a receiver to reject the
          files received, no matter whether the files have been correctly
          received or not. When the meta-data are appended to the object,
          corrupting the meta-data means that the compound object will be
          corrupted.</t>

          <t>It is therefore RECOMMENDED that measures be taken to guarantee
          the integrity and to check the sender's identity of the compound
          object. To that purpose, one of the counter-measures mentioned above
          (<xref target="obj_corruption"></xref>) SHOULD be used. These
          measures will either be applied on a packet level, or globally over

        <section anchor="attack_against_alc"
                 title="Attacks Against the ALC/LCT Parameters">
          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>By corrupting the ALC/LCT header (or header extensions) one can
          execute attacks on the underlying ALC/LCT implementation. For
          example, sending forged ALC packets with the Close Session flag (A)
          set one can lead the receiver to prematurely close the session.
          Similarly, sending forged ALC packets with the Close Object flag (B)
          set one can lead the receiver to prematurely give up the reception
          of an object.</t>

          <t>It is therefore RECOMMENDED that measures be taken to guarantee
          the integrity and to check the sender's identity of each ALC packet
          received. To that purpose, one of the counter-measures mentioned
          above (<xref target="obj_corruption"></xref>) SHOULD be used.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="attack_against_bb"
                 title="Attacks Against the Associated Building Blocks">
          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>Let us first focus on the congestion control building block that
          may be used in the ALC session. A receiver with an incorrect or
          corrupted implementation of the multiple rate congestion control
          building block may affect the health of the network in the path
          between the sender and the receiver. That may also affect the
          reception rates of other receivers who joined the session.</t>

          <t>When congestion control building block is applied with FCAST, it
          is therefore RECOMMENDED that receivers be required to identify
          themselves as legitimate before they receive the Session Description
          needed to join the session. How receivers identify themselves as
          legitimate is outside the scope of this document. If authenticating
          a receiver does not prevent this latter to launch an attack, it will
          enable the network operator to identify him and to take
          counter-measures.</t>

          <t>When congestion control building block is applied with FCAST/ALC,
          it is also RECOMMENDED that a packet level authentication scheme be
          used, as explained in <xref target="obj_corruption"></xref>. Some of
          them, like TESLA, only provide a delayed authentication service,
          whereas congestion control requires a rapid reaction. It is
          therefore RECOMMENDED [2] that a receiver using TESLA quickly
          reduces its subscription level when the receiver believes that a
          congestion did occur, even if the packet has not yet been
          authenticated. Therefore TESLA will not prevent DoS attacks where an
          attacker makes the receiver believe that a congestion occurred. This
          is an issue for the receiver, but this will not compromise the
          network since no congestion actually occurred. Other authentication
          methods that do not feature this delayed authentication could be
          preferred, or a group MAC scheme could be used in parallel to TESLA
          to reduce the probability of this attack.</t>

        <t>Lastly, we note that the security considerations that apply to, and

        FCAST builds on those specifications. In addition, any security

      <t>In case of FCAST/NORM, the meta-data (or a subset of it) can be
      carried as part of a NORM_INFO message.
      In the following example we assume that the whole meta-data is carried
      in such a message for a certain object.
      </t>

      <t>
      The NORM_INFO message is the following...

      TODO
      </t>

      <t>
      Note that this message contains the EXT_FTI header extension to
      carry the FEC OTI. Two alternatives would have been to either
      include FEC OTI directly in the meta-data part of the NORM_INFO
      message, or to include an EXT_FTI header extension to all
      NORM_DATA packets (or a subset of them).
      </t>

      <t>
      The FCAST compound object does not contain any meta-data and is formatted
      as in ><xref target="expl_no_meta-data"></xref>.
