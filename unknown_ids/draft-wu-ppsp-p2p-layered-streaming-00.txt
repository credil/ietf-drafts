Abstract

   The scenarios where a Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol (PPSP) contains
   heterogeneous nodes need special considerations. For example, mobile
   devices, PCs and set-top boxes may all need to access and provide
   service for the same content. To support heterogeneity and maximize
   the total network utilization, it may be necessary to have layered
   coding of content to achieve desired results. This document defines
   the Layered P2P Streaming in PPSP with support for heterogeneous peer
   nodes.

1. Introduction

   Single layer video streaming cannot satisfy heterogeneous customer
   requirement and heterogeneous download capacity. There are existing
   systems that use multiple versions of video content (each encoded at
   different resolution or visual quality) to minimize the overall
   transmission cost. For example, lower resolution video can be sent to

   mobile devices while higher resolution or high quality video is sent
   to PC or STB players. However, in the P2P network, if there are too
   many independent video data transmitting, the users' inbound and
   outbound bandwidth will not be efficiently used [3]. Peers in
   different versions will not help each other. The overall video
   quality received will not be optimal.

   The basic idea of layered encoding is that a video sequence is
   divided into multiple non-overlapped bit streams, or layers. The base
   layer contains the basic data representing the most important
   features of the video [2]. Additional layers, called enhancement
   layers, contain data that progressively refine the reconstructed
   video quality. According to the available bandwidth, participating
   nodes subscribe a subset of the layers to reconstruct the video with
   certain quality degradation [2].

   Layered video has the advantage of bandwidth efficiency and at the
   same time meets the real-time streaming requirement of peer clients
   with wide range of variation in processing power, display capability
   and network conditions. In other words, although heterogeneity exists
   for peers in the P2P network, an optimal viewing experience can be
   achieved for each peer based on its own access bandwidth and
   capabilities.

   An important requirement for Layered P2P streaming is that both base
   layer and enhancement layers can be decoded by standard compliant
   single layer decoders that have already been widely adopted, e.g.
   H.264/AVC, MPEG-4, etc. It requires minimum codec modifications
   because for many peer clients (e.g. STB or HMC), its decoder is hard-
   coded into the IC and cannot be changed at all.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

   Multi-layer P2P Streaming: multiple bit streams (layers) of same
   media content co-exist in the same P2P streaming group/session; each
   layer corresponds to a different media quality level; peers can
   choose different layers for decode and playback;

   Base Layer (BL): unique Base Layer (required by all upper level
   layers for proper decoding);

   Enhancement Layer (EL_i): i_th enhancement layer;

   Heterogeneous peers: peers have different processing power, access
   bandwidth, or display constraints;

   Low capacity peers, with low processing power, low access bandwidth
   or low display capability, e.g. mobile devices.

   High capacity peers, with high processing power, high access
   bandwidth or high definition display, e.g. media center PC, or HD Set
   Top Box.

   Layered coding: coding scheme that produces multiple layers of media
   streams for the same content. A higher layer can be decoded only if
   all the lower layers are available. Generally, layered coding does
   not lose much video coding efficiency compared with single layer
   coding streaming.

   Decode ability: compatibility of the media bit stream that can be
   correctly decoded by the standard compliant decoders, e.g. H.264/AVC
   or MPEG-4.

   Layer Information: It keeps the layer number and the information for
   each layer. For example, the information contains bitrate, resolution,
   frame rate, QP factor, etc. A peer can select the suitable layer
   according to its hardware configuration or network situation.

3. Architecture



   Layered P2P can be considered a generalized version of single layer
   P2P. We describe how different components in single layer P2P need to
   be extended. Same as in single layer P2P, there is a meta file. In
   layered P2P, the meta file contains a layered content description.

   A peer doing layered P2P has an important module that determines the
   number of layers it will subscribe to. This module may take manual
   input (e.g. the user decides to get base layer only, or to get HD no
   matter what). If there is no manual input, the module selects an
   appropriate number of layers to get, based on network conditions.

   The peer-tracker protocol should allow a peer to indicate which
   layers are of interest. The tracker will then take that into
   consideration in returning peer-list. Optionally, the peers in peer-
   list may come with layer information. The management/status reports
   from peer to tracker should also indicate layer information about the
   local peer.

   Each peer doing layered P2P has a more complicated scheduling module,
   figuring out which chunks in which layer have higher priority to get.
   There is no need to standardize the scheduling algorithm. The
   performance metrics related to this module (e.g. throughput, delay,
   layer completion ratio, waste ratio etc.) are discussed in later
   sections.

   The peer-to-peer protocol for signaling (exchanging bitmap
   information) needs to have an extension to describe layered bitmaps
   and related data structures. The peer-to-peer data plane protocol can
   be almost the same as the single-layer case; the only extension is to
   add indicator for which layer the requested chunk belongs to.



3.1. Function Entities and Interfaces

   Layered P2P architecture is extended from the single layer P2P
   streaming (PPSP) with modification of adding layer_i to meet the
   layered streaming requirement. Layer_i is the No. of active layer.

   Different from the single layer P2P streaming, peer and tracker need
   to keep the layer information. The following components are
   considered:

   1) Transmission of PUT-LAYER messages, by which source tells trackers
   the layer information the streaming is using.

   2) Transmission of GET-LAYER messages, by which peers request what
   they want and get the layer information from trackers.

   3) Transmission of PUT-CHUNK messages, by which peers tell trackers
   what they have. The bitfield can represent chunk_i.

   4) Transmission of GET-PEERLIST messages, by which peers request what
   they want and get candidate peers list from trackers.

   5) Transmission of STATISTICS requests and responses, by which
   trackers can get peers status, network performance, layer_i, etc.



3.2. Layered Dependency

   The upper layers depend on the lower layers. An incomplete lower
   layer renders all chunks of upper layers useless. Hence, chunks of
   lower layers always carry high priority than chunks of higher layers.
   In reality, missing data (or delay of chunk arriving) is impossible
   to avoid. Certain error handling (e.g. error resilient decode or
   error concealment) mechanism in the players are needed to make sure
   errors in one layer won't propagate and destroy the whole upper
   layers.

Internet-Draft          P2P Layered Streaming               March 2010


   Specific techniques used for such error concealment tools are beyond
   the scope of this document. However, we will give some default
   mechanisms for handling such cases. A practical Layered P2P system
   can choose any way to implement it.



3.3. Layered Indication

   Once a peer determines the highest layer (HL) it will subscribe to,
   only chunks belong to HL or lower layers are of interest to this
   local peer. When the peer sends the GET-PEERLIST request, the peer
   layer flag should be included in the request message. The neighbor
   peer and tracker will then take the layer information into
   consideration in returning peerlist. The peers in peerlist may come
   with layer info.

   The management/status reports from peer to tracker should also
   indicate layer info about the local peer.



4. Message Flows

4.1. PUT-LAYER (Put Layer Information) into Tracker

   When the source put the layer information, tracker will reply an ACK.
   The layer information keeps the layer number and the information for
   each layer.

4.4. GET-PEERLIST (Peer Selection)

   The helpful neighbors of a peer should be those with equal or higher
   layer peers. When a peer sends the GET-PEERLIST request, the numbers
   of active layers of the peer should be included in the request
   message.

   Each peer's peer selection strategy is based on its own criterion
   (layers for playback, tolerance for delays, jitter, and other factors,
   e.g. QoE parameters). The optimal peer selection algorithm is beyond
   the scope of this document. The document only specifies that there is
   a peer selection strategy such that Layer ID is part of the
   parameters, and can be used for data exchange (via buffer map).

4.5. LAYER-CHANGE (Layer Change)

   Peer can select its suitable active layer according to it current
   network bandwidth. For example, when a peer's bandwidth is high, the
   peer can request all layer chunks. But when a peer's bandwidth is
   slow, the peer can request lower layers, or just base layer chunks.
   When the peer changes its layer state, it will send message to notify
   its peers and tracker for updating its information.

5. Open issues

5.1. Data Scheduling

   Different coding scheme has different optimal data scheduling
   strategy. This document does not specify which specific coding scheme
   to use, except that it has to be compliant with media codec standard
   (e.g. H.264/AVC or MPEG-4) at each and every layer to avoid a
   requirement for non-standard compliant decoder in the peer player.

   A simple greedy data scheduling strategy is proposed in [3] and can
   be adopted here for layered P2P streaming. Each peer requests lower
   layers from lower bandwidth neighbors and higher layers from high
   bandwidth neighbors. This scheduling strategy is proven to be optimal
   for a given single peer within a certain time slot but may not be
   globally optimal.

5.2. System Performance Metrics

   Although the layered encoding scheme brings more flexibility for
   participating peers to achieve adaptive video quality, it also causes
   challenges to the P2P protocol for layer streaming. In the paper [2],
   the following four performance metrics are mentioned.



5.2.1. Throughput and Delay

   It is the basic requirement that the overall P2P network can maximize
   the overlay throughput and keep low packet delay. [2]



5.2.2. Layer delivery ratio

   In single layered P2P streaming, maximizing the node delivery ratio
   is almost equal to maximizing the throughput. But it is not the case
   in layered streaming. In multiple layered P2P streaming, subscribing
   many layers but with low delivery ratio for each layer can result in
   high throughput. But, the video quality cannot be high because of the
   layer dependency. Therefore, it is a key point to ensure high
   delivery ratio for subscribed layers. [2]



5.2.3. Useless packets ratio

   According to the layered encoding/decoding scheme, the decoding of
   upper layers depends on the availability of lower layers. If some
   lower layer packets are missed, the packets with the same sequence
   IDs in the upper layers cannot be correctly decoded. The upper layer
   packets become useless. Therefore, it is a key point that the useless
   packet ratio should be kept low. [2]



5.2.4. Jitter prevention

   Because Internet is a dynamic environment, the bandwidth variation is
   common in P2P network. If the node subscribes more layers immediately
   after bandwidth increased, it may have to drop the high layers after
   a short while according to the bandwidth decreasing. This short-term
   subscribe-drop pair is called jitter. Jitter brings fluctuation in
   quality of service (QoS) and causes its buffer overflow or underflow.


Wu, et al.           Expires September 11, 2010              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          P2P Layered Streaming               March 2010


   Therefore, jitter should be considered for being prevented by the
   data scheduling design. [2]

5.3. User Performance Metrics

   A set of QoE parameters, e.g. layers for playback, peer preference,
   tolerance of artifacts (e.g. delay, jitter, freeze, or error blocks
   effect) etc., may be defined and implemented as system tools inside
   or outside of the P2P layered streaming. The peer selection criterion
   can make best use of such information to make sure that it can obtain
   its optimal playback layer from the right peers.

   One of the important goals for layered P2P streaming is to enhance
   the overall user quality of experience by designing the p2p streaming
   protocol to utilize the heterogeneous conditions of participating
   peers. For example, the start-up delay is the duration between a peer
   makes its request for a stream and the stream actually begins to play
   at the peer. Layered P2P streaming can reduce the start-up delay by
   serving the BL (Base Layer) first to the peer while enhancement
   layers may be delivered later with lower priority. The playback
   continuity and playback delay can be set as quality metrics as well
   by the P2P network to dynamically adjust for performance tuning or
   tradeoff between various quality metrics.

   Several quality metrics may be considered in Layered PPSP for live
   streaming and progressing downloading.

5.3.1. Start-up Delay

   The start-up delay is the duration between a peer makes a request for
   a stream and the stream actually begins to play at the peer.

5.3.2. Playback Continuity

   Playback continuity is the percentage of the playing streaming
   successfully played at the correct time.

5.3.3. Playback Delay

   Playback delay is the delay between a streaming chunk which is
   generated by the source and the streaming chunk being viewed by the
   peer.
