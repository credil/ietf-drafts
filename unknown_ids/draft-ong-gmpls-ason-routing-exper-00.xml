   <t>IETF CCAMP WG has defined a set of extensions to OSPFv2 to support
   ASON routing requirements.  These extensions have been given EXP
   status rather than Standards Track and according to guidelines for 
   OSPFv2 have not been allocated standard codepoints by IANA.</t>
   
   <t>This draft describes implementation and interoperability testing
   experiences with ASON routing extensions to OSPFv2 which provide
   equivalent routing functionality to the extensions defined in IETF
   CCAMP with some differences in formatting of the extensions.</t>

   <t>This summary of implementation and testing is provided 
   to help move ASON Routing extensions for OSPF to Standards Track.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This draft presents results of interoperability testing on the 
   part of the authors and others that have been 
   involved in understanding and prototyping routing for ASON as part of
   the OIF (Optical Internetworking Forum).  Some of the authors
   have contributed to the work in IETF on ASON routing requirements
   and protocol evaluation.  Many of the requirements
   and protocol functions discussed in 
<xref target="RFC4258"></xref> and 
<xref target="RFC4652"></xref>
   have been incorporated into prototyping work at OIF.

   Experimental protocol extensions to OSPF were implemented to support 
   the functions identified in 
<xref target="RFC4258"></xref> and 
<xref target="RFC4652"></xref>.</t>

   <t>Note that these extensions have been tested in a transport-only
   instance of OSPF, i.e. routing implementations supported only
   optical routing and did not participate in any IP routing
   use of OSPF.</t>

   <t>Since then, the IETF has published a draft (
<xref target="OSPF-ASON"></xref>) addressing
   some of the features implemented by those prototypes. 
   However, the latest revision of 
<xref target="OSPF-ASON"></xref> (-09) no longer provides
   IETF-standardized code points for such sub-TLVs, due to its Experimental
   Status and the existing guidelines for allocation of codepoints for
   OSPF.</t> 

   <t>This draft summarizes testing of ASON routing extensions done by the
   authors and others participating in OIF interop testing to assist 
   in the process of moving ASON routing extensions to Standards Track.</t>
</section>

<section title="Reachability">>

<section title="Review of ASON Routing draft">

   <t>In order to advertise blocks of reachable address prefixes a
   summarization mechanism was proposed in 
<xref target="OSPF-ASON"></xref>.</t>

   <t>This extension consists of a network mask (a 32-bit number
   indicating the range of IP addresses residing on a single IP
   network/subnet). The set of local addresses is carried in an OSPFv2
   TE LSA node attribute TLV (a specific sub-TLV is defined per address
   family, i.e., IPv4 and IPv6, used as network-unique identifiers).</t>

   <t>Similar functionality was implemented and tested by the authors 
   and others.  At the time of initial prototyping, the OSPFv2 TE 
   LSA node attribute TLV had not been defined, so somewhat different
   formatting was used to carry IP prefixes.</t>  

   <t>The tested solution used a new sub-TLV 
   to carry the same information, called the Reachable IPv4 Prefix sub-TLV.
   This sub-TLV was carried in a new OSPFv2 Reachable Address
   TLV. Details of the TLV are given in section 5.</t>
</section>

<section title="Tested IPv4 Reachability Advertisement">


   <t>The Reachable IPv4 Prefix sub-TLV used the following format:</t>

</section>

<section title="Link Attributes">
<section title="Review of ASON Routing draft">

   <t><xref target="OSPF-ASON"></xref> defined additional terminology and scoping of link 
   attributes advertised in a GMPLS LSA.  One attribute which was
   left open for possible technology-specific enhancements was the
   the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD).  </t>

   <t>For prototyping purposes for control of SONET/SDH networks, the 
   following technology-specific enhancement was implemented.</t>
</section>

<section title="Bandwidth Accounting for ITU-T SONET/SDH Layers">

   <t>GMPLS Routing defines an Interface Switching Capability Descriptor
   (ISCD) that delivers, among other things, information about the
   (maximum/minimum) bandwidth per priority that an LSP can make use of.
   Per 
<xref target="RFC4202"></xref> and <xref target="RFC4203"></xref>, one or more ISCD sub-TLVs can be
   associated with an interface. This information, combined with the
   Unreserved Bandwidth (sub-TLV defined in <xref target="RFC3630"></xref>, Section 2.5.8),
   provides the basis for bandwidth accounting.</t>

   <t><xref target="OSPF-ASON"></xref> states that in the ASON context, additional information 
   may be included when representation and information in the other 
   advertised fields are not sufficient for a specific technology 
   (e.g., SDH). The definition of technology-specific information 
   elements was left beyond the scope of <xref target="OSPF-ASON"></xref>, in the draft. </t>

<section title="SONET/SDH-specific connection availability">

   <t>For SONET/SDH networks with switches capable of handling 
   multiple layer networks, a single link may be used for a 
   number of TDM layers.  For example, an OC192 link may be
   used for STS-1, STS-3c, STS-12c, STS-48c, STS-192c 
   connections, switched by the same fabric.</t>

   <t>GMPLS appears to offer a number of possible options for advertising link
   characteristics where multiple layers are supported by the same
   physical link.</t>

   <t>One option is to advertise separate Link TLVs for each layer.  A
   second option is to advertise multiple ISCD sub-TLVs within a 
   single Link TLV for the link.  A third option is to advertise a
   single Link TLV and ISCD sub-TLV and attempt to derive bandwidth
   availability for multiple TDM layers from this information. </t>

   <t>All three options were found to have some disadvantages and 
   instead a technology-specific ISCD sub-TLV was defined containing information that
   applies to multiple TDM layers.</t>

   <t>This solution was
   implemented for the following reasons:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
   <t>If separate TLVs are advertised for each layer, then common
   information such as LSA header information, link type,
   link ID, link local and remote identifiers, protection
   type, administrative group and shared risk are repeated
   for each layer.</t>

   <t>
   If separate ISCD sub-TLVs are advertised for each layer,
   then common information such as the Switching Capability
   (TDM) and Encoding Type (SONET/SDH) are repeated for 
   each layer.</t>

<t>
Deriving bandwidth availability from a single ISCD sub-TLV which 
contains the total available bandwidth and the minimum reservable
bandwidth yields potentially inaccurate results, since support of
standard concatenation requires sequential timeslots in a particular
position, and this can be blocked by a smaller signal in that space.
Some available bandwidth may not be usable as a result.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
   A technology-specific ISCD sub-TLV that carried a compact
   description of the number of unallocated timeslots at each
   supported SONET/SDH signal type was used instead of separate 
   Link TLVs or ISCD sub-TLVs and carried exact availability
   information for each signal type.  The indication 
   subfield was also removed as no longer necessary since Arbitrary
   SONET/SDH is not supported.
</t>


  <t> The following technology-specific ISCD format was tested: </t>

Note: n defines the number of signal types supported on this link, 
   and thus has a value greater than or equal to 1.
   Inherited from [RFC4202], the Switching Capability field and the
   Encoding field MUST take the following values for Sonet/SDH
   interfaces: 
   Switching Capability (8 bits): value 100 (TDM).
   Encoding (8 bits): value 5 for Sonet/SDH.
   Reserved (16 bits): must be set to zero when sent and ignored when
   received.

<t>
   Number of Unallocated Timeslots (24 bits):
</t>
<t>
   Specifies the number of identical unallocated timeslots per Signal
   Type and per TE Link. As such, the initial value(s) of this TLV
   indicates the total capacity in terms of number of timeslots per TE
   link.  The signal type included in the BW announcement is specific to
   the layer link being reported and is not derived from some other
   signal type (e.g. STS-48c is not announced as 16 x STS-3c).
</t>

<t>
   For instance on an OC-192/STM-64 interface either the number of STS-3c
   SPE/VC-4 unallocated timeslots is initially equal to 64, or the number
   of STS-48c SPE/VC-4-16c unallocated timeslots is equal to 4 or even a
   combination of both type of signals depending on the interface
   capabilities. Once one of these components gets allocated for a given
   connection, the number of unallocated timeslots is decreased by the
   number of timeslots this connection implies.

<section title="Routing Information Scope">

	<section title="Review of ASON Routing Draft">

   <t><xref target="OSPF-ASON"></xref> proposed extensions to allow the scope of routing
   Information to allow flexibility between the relationship of
   The advertising router and the TE router. Similar extensions
   with slightly different format were implemented in testing.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Link Advertisement (Local and Remote TE Router ID sub-TLVs)">

   <t>Implementations followed the concepts defined in [OSPF-ASON] to
   Allow flexible relationship between the Router-ID and the TE
   Router-ID.  The following is given in [OSPF-ASON]:
</t>

   <t>A Router-ID (Ri) advertising on behalf multiple TE Router_IDs (Lis)
   creates a 1:N relationship between the Router-ID and the TE
   Router-ID. As the link local and link remote (unnumbered) ID
   association is not unique per node (per Li unicity), the
   advertisement needs to indicate the remote Lj value and rely on the
   initial discovery process to retrieve the [Li;Lj] relationship. In
   brief, as unnumbered links have their ID defined on per Li bases,
   the remote Lj needs to be identified to scope the link remote ID to
   the local Li. Therefore, the routing protocol MUST be able to
   disambiguate the advertised TE links so that they can be associated
   with the correct TE Router-ID.
</t>

<t>   The tested extensions used two sub-TLVs of the (OSPFv2 TE LSA) top
   level Link TLV that define the local and the remote
   TE Router-ID.  These are combined into a single sub-TLV in 
   [OSPF-ASON] (the Local and Remote TE Router-ID sub-TLV), however
   implementation and testing began before [OSPF-ASON] was defined.
</t>

<t>   The formats of the Local and Remote TE Router-ID sub-TLVs were:

<t>
   These sub-TLVs were always included as part of the top
   level Link TLV as it was assumed that the Router-ID could always
   advertise on behalf of multiple TE Router-IDs. 
</t>
</section>


<section title="Reachability Advertisement (Local TE Router ID sub-TLV)">

<t>
   When the Router-ID is advertised on behalf of multiple TE Router-IDs
   (Lis), the routing protocol MUST be able to associate the advertised
   reachability information with the correct TE Router-ID.
</t>

<t>
   For this purpose, a new sub-TLV of the (OSPFv2 TE LSA) top level
   Node Attribute TLV was introduced in <xref target="OSPF-ASON"></xref>.  Since this
   sub-TLV had not yet been defined at the time of initial
   implementation, a sub-TLV was defined independently for
   prototype testing. In this case the format is the same.
</t>

<t>
   The tested solution used a new sub-TLV of the (OSPFv2 TE LSA) top 
   level Reachable Address TLV (see section 5): the TE Router ID sub-TLV.
</t>

<t>
   The TE Router_ID sub-TLV used the following format:

<section title="New Reachable Address top-level TLV">

<t>
   When the OSPFv2 extensions for ASON routing were designed for the
   first OIF interoperability demonstrations, 
   draft-ietf-ospf-te-node-addr draft was at a very early stage, 
   and the Node Attribute top-level TLV was not available to carry
   reachable prefixes.  Instead a new experimental top-level TLV 
   was defined: the Reachable Address top-level TLV.
</t>

<t>
   Contrary to <xref target="OSPF-ASON"></xref> where each Node Attribute top-level TLV
   carries reachable prefixes for a single TE Router ID (so that if
   a Router advertises reachable prefixes on behalf of multiple
   TE Router IDs, it will originate multiple OSPFv2 TE LSAs
   with a Node Attribute TLV), the Reachable Address top-level TLV
   may be used to advertise reachable prefixes attached to 
   multiple TE Router IDs: in order to do so, a TE Router ID
   sub-TLV MUST appear before the Reachable Address sub-TLV(s).

   This tested format is functionally equivalent to the
   format defined in <xref target="OSPF-ASON"></xref> but is
   independent of the function of advertising local addresses of
   a router for MPLS TE LSPs as defined in <xref target="OSPF-NODE"></xref>.

<section title="Implementation and Testing Results">

<t>
   Testing of these protocol extensions was carried out at a number of
   testing events from 2003-2009, most recently occurring over a period 
   of months during July-September 2007 and April-June 2009.  There were 
   7 independent implementations tested at each event as listed below:
</t>

<t>    2007 interop test implementations:</t>

    <t>Alcatel-Lucent</t>	
    <t>Ciena Corporation</t>

    <t>Sycamore Networks</t>	
    <t>Tellabs</t>	
    <t>ZTE</t>
</list></t>		

<t>
   Initial implementation and interop testing of ASON 
   routing extensions began as early as 2003.
</t>
<t>
   Further information about the testing conducted can be found at
   http://www.oiforum.com/public/OIF_demos.html
</t>
<t>
   All implementations utilized the ASON routing extensions described
   in this draft.
</t>
<t>
   Results were:
</t>
<t><list style="symbols">

<t>prototype implementations were interoperable</t>
<t>aligned TE database was achieved by participating implementations</t>
<t>path computation was successfully achieved for connections</t>
<t>connections were successfully set up at different SONET/SDH
      rates using the TE database</t>
</list></t>


<section title="Standardization">

<t>
   These testing results are provided in the interests of achieving
   standard OSPFv2 protocol extensions to support ASON routing. The
   extensions tested are very similar in functionality to the
   extensions defined in <xref target="OSPF-ASON"></xref>, with the exception of the 
   technology-specific ISCD sub-TLV used. The results of this
   implementation and testing show that these functions are
   useful and implementable, and that ASON routing extensions
   to OSPF should be Standards Track rather than Experimental.
</t>
<t>
   It is believed by the authors that the tested TLVs and sub-TLVs
   are equivalent in functionality to the extensions
   defined in <xref target="OSPF-ASON"></xref> and could be adopted by IETF as extensions
   to OSPF used in a transport instance.  
</t>
<t>
   This would enhance the adoption of standard GMPLS routing
   extensions for ASON as a set of implementations for these 
   routing extensions will have already been tested and 
   these extensions would as a result be available sooner for 
   use in the industry.
