Abstract

    This document extends local routing in proxy Mobile IPv6 and defines
    a simplified localized routing optimization protocol within one
    PMIPv6 domain. The protocol supports IPv4 transport network
    operation, IPv4 home address mobility and handover. The Local
    mobility anchor/mobile access gateway initiates local routing for
    the mobile and correspondent node by sending messages to each mobile
    access gateway/local mobility anchor. In case the correspondent node
    is connected to another local mobility anchor, the local mobility
    anchors connected by the correspondent node needs to be discovered
    firstly so that it can notify its mobile access gateways to the
    mobile access gateway attached by the mobile node afterwards. Mobile
    access gateways create and refresh bindings using proxy binding
    update and acknowledgement messages.

1. Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] can allow the Mobility Access Gateway
   (MAG) to optimize the media delivery by locally routing the packets
   within one MAG and by not reverse tunneling them to the mobile node's
   local mobility anchor (LMA). However it does not address the case of
   routing optimization between two MAGs sharing the same LMA or
   registering to the different LMA. The capability for local routing
   optimization provided in [RFC5213] requires the MAG to support the
   EnableMAGLocalRouting flag and allow the MAG to control local routing
   optimization behavior. However, [RFC5213] does not define how local
   routing optimization capability is detected, who initiates local
   routing optimization and how to negotiate between the MAG and the LMA
   to determine whether the local routing optimization is allowed.

   This document defines a local routing optimization mobility messages
   or options for proxy mobile ipv6 that is intended to assist the MAGs
   to negotiate and setup local routing path between each other. The new
   local routing optimization mobility options included in each binding
   update or local routing optimization messages exchange is used to
   negotiate between the LMA and the MAG whether and what local routing
   is allowed. Different from the local forwarding control message
   described in the [I-D.LocalFwd], the local routing optimization
   messages can be initiated by either of pmip6 managed node and provide
   flexible negotiation mechanism for local routing. As [RFC5213] warns,
   use of local routing may affect accounting and traffic policies
   relating to the mobile node, LMA routing policies, and security
   policies. The general aim of the proposals in this document is to
   provide better manageability of mobility services and mobility
   service provisioning from the point of view of both operators and
   service providers within one PMIPv6 domain.

3. Scenarios analysis for PMIP6 local routing

   Figure 1 shows the reference architecture for PMIP6 local routing. In
   this architecture, the local communication between PMIPv6 managed
   nodes is constrained within a single PMIPv6 domain. LMA1 and LMA2
   which MN and CN are respectively anchored to may be the same LMA or
   different LMAs in the same PMIPv6 domain. With IPv4 transport support,

   the NAT may exist between MAG1 and MAG2 or between the LMA1 and LMA2.
   Depending on how MN and CN are distributed into one PMIP6 domain,
   three typical scenarios need to be considered as follows:

   Scenario 1: Intra-MAG local routing

   In this scenario, MN and CN attach to the same MAG and are anchored
   with the same LMA or different LMAs.

   Scenario 2: Intra-LMA local routing

   In this scenario, MN and CN attach to the different MAGs and are
   anchored with the same LMA.

   Scenario 3: Inter-LMA local routing

   In this scenario, MN and CN attach to the different MAGs and are
   anchored with the different LMAs.

   In all the above scenarios, although all the PMIP6 managed node are
   constrained in the same PMIP6 domain, however MN and CN may be
   roaming user and their subscription may belong to the different
   operators described in [I-D.wu-netext-pmipv6-ipv4-ro-ps], e.g.,
   roaming user MN moves to the visited network owned by the operator
   using IPv4 transport where no-roaming CN is located. Another example
   is roaming user MN and CN move to the same visited network and use
   the different LMAs within the same PMIP6 domain.



4. Local routing optimization protocol overview

   The protocol specified here assumes that the MAG and the LMA are
   situated in one PMIP domain and MN and CN attach to the same MAG or
   MN and CN are anchored with the same LMA.(i.e., intra-MAG local
   routing or intra-LMA local routing occurs). The MAG has the
   capability to perceive intra-MAG local routing (i.e., in the intra-
   MAG local routing scenario, the MAG can detect whether the mobile
   node and correspondent node attach to the same MAG by checking
   binding update list). The LMA has the capability to perceive intra-
   LMA local routing (i.e., in the intra-LMA local routing scenario, the
   LMA can detect whether the MAGs to which MN and CN are attach belong
   to the same or different LMAs by checking its binding cache list).
   The flag EnableDetectLocalRouting on the MAG and LMA may be used to
   control this behavior. The decision to enable/disable detection of
   local routing should be based on the policy configured on the MAG or
   LMA. The specific details on how this is achieved are beyond of the
   scope of this document. Subsequently there are two modes in which the
   local routing optimization protocol operates.



4.1. MAG initiated local routing optimization

   When the EnableDetectLocalRouting is enabled in the MAG, the MAG can
   start to detect whether the MN and CN attach to the same MAG by
   checking binding List of MN and CN.

   Upon the MAG intercept the packet from the MN and perceives MN and CN
   attach to the same MAG, it can initiate local routing optimization to
   determine the value of the intra-MAG localrouting flag (defined in

Internet-Draft  Proxy MIP Extension for local routing        July 2009


   section 5) by message exchange between the MAG and LMA (If the MAG
   attached by the MN and CN register to the different LMAs, it needs to
   initiate local routing optimization to the different LMAs
   respectively). When the MAG perceives intra-MAG local routing is not
   possible but want to check whether intra-LMA routing is allowed, it
   also can initiate the local routing optimization by message exchange
   between the MAG and LMA. The message may be an binding update message
   which contains the local routing optimization mobility option and
   home network prefix option for the correspondent node or a newly
   defined local routing optimization message. It will be used to
   negotiate with LMA to determine whether or what the local routing
   optimization between the mobile node and correspondent node is
   supported. The AAA server can be used to authorize the use of
   localized routing serice for MN. If the AAA sever does not authorize
   the use of localized routing service or the LMA does not allow the
   MAG bypass traffic from itself, it will respond to the MAG that the
   local routing optimization is not available. Otherwise it will set
   the intra-MAG locarouting or intra-LMA localrouting flag on the MAG
   into value one in the successful response message.

   After successful local routing optimization process, if MN and CN
   attach to the different MAGs, i.e., MAG1, MAG2, the MAG1 to which the
   MN attaches may send PBU message to the MAG2 which the CN attaches to.
   The PBU/PBA signaling is protected using IPsec Encapsulation security
   payload [RFC4303]in transport mode with mandatory integrity
   protection. This PBU message sets the lifetime of the binding of MN
   at MAG2. Similarly the MAG2 sends PBU message to the MAG1. This PBU
   message sets the lifetime of the binding of CN at MAG1. Each PBU MUST
   be acknowledged with PBAs. With PBU/PBA exchange, the local data path
   between MAGs is established. Also PBU-PBA exchange is repeated to
   extend the lifetime of the binding.

   For the data traffic, either of the MAGs can lookup local routing
   flag and process traffic in terms of the value of Localrouting flag.
   If the Intra-MAG Localrouting flag is set to value one, the traffic
   from MN will go directly to CN via MAG. If the Intra-LMA localrouting
   flag is set to value one, the traffic from MN will be forwarded
   directly to the MAG associated with the CN.

4.1.1. Handover Consideration

   In case of handover when the MN moves from the old MAG (e.g., pMAG1)
   in the previous access network to the new MAG(e.g., nMAG1) in the new
   access network, registration entry for MN in pMAG1's Binding update
   list should be transferred to the nMAG1. The context request option
   defined in the [I-D.ietf-mipshop-pfmipv6] can be reused here to carry
   the context information on MAG1. And the new MAG(i.e., nMAG1) sends
   PBUs to each MAG with which MN was in communication via local route
   optimization path established.  This PBU/PBA exchange updates the
   binding in each MAG with which MN was in communication and re-
   establishes optimal local route path between MN and its CNs.

   start to detect whether the MN and CN register to the same LMA by
   checking binding List of MN and CN. Upon receiving the packet from
   the CN and perceiving MN and CN register to the same LMA, it can
   initiate local routing optimization to determine the value of Intra-
   LMA localrouting flag (defined in section 5) and notify it to the MAG
   by message exchange between the MAG and LMA. The message could be
   proxy binding update message which contain local routing optimization

   mobility option or a newly defined routing optimization message. It
   will be used to help LMA to determine whether or not the local
   routing optimization is allowed and enforce the local optimization
   on the MAG. The AAA server serving LMA can be used to authorize the
   use of localized routing serice for MN. If the AAA sever does not
   authorize the use of localized routing service or If the LMA verifies
   there exists binding cache list of correspondent node and mobile node
   and allow the MAG bypass traffic between mobile node and
   correspondent node
   from itself, it will notify the MAG to set the intra-LMA Localrouting
   flag into value one, otherwise, it will respond to MAG with failure
   information which indicate the intra-LMA routing optimization is not
   supported. The other procedures are same as that of section 4.1.

4.2.1. Handover Consideration

   In case of handover when the MN moves from the old MAG (e.g., MAG1)
   in the previous access network to the new MAG(e.g., MAG3) in the new
   access network, MAG1 may request LMA by sending PBU or LROREQ to
   update binding of each MAG with which MN was in communication via
   local route optimization path established. Also MAG1 can use the
   similar procedure described in the section 4.1.1 to transfer MN's
   registration entry on MAG1 to the new MAG (i.e., MAG3).

5. Process consideration

5.1. Mobile Access Gateway Consideration

   The MAG may include the routing optimization mobility option and the
   correspondent node's home network prefix option into binding update
   message or create a new routing optimization request message in which
   the above two options are contained. The routing optimization
   mobility option is used to negotiate which kind of local routing
   optimization is available. The correspondent node's home network
   prefix option is used for the LMA to verify the validity of local
   routing optimization path end points (in the intra-MAG local routing
   scenario) or to request the LMA to determine proxy CoA-Address of
   correspondent node for local routing optimization (in the intra-LMA
   local routing scenario). In the intra-MAG local routing case, LRI


Wu,et al.             Expires January 13, 2010               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft  Proxy MIP Extension for local routing        July 2009


   field in routing optimization mobility option is set into value 1
   while in the intra-LMA local routing case, LRI field in routing
   optimization mobility option is set into value 0 for mobile node's
   MAG does not know whether traffic between MN and CN can be locally
   routed within one LMA.

   If the MAG receives binding acknowledge message with routing
   optimization mobility option or routing optimization response message,
   it will extract the LRI field from the routing optimization mobility
   option or routing optimization response message and check the value
   of it. If LRI field is 0, it indicates the LMA does not support this
   local routing optimization and the MAG should set intra-MAG
   LocalRouting flag to value 0 in the binding update list extension; if
   LRI field is 1, it indicates the LMA allow local routing in one MAG
   and bypass the LMA and MAG should set intra-MAG LocalRouting flag to
   value 1 in the binding update list extension, if LRI field is 2, it
   indicates LMA has find correspondent node's MAG address in terms of
   home network prefix of CN and MAG should extract correspondent node's
   MAG address from initial binding acknowledge message or routing
   optimization response message and store it in binding update list
   extension with correspondent node's home network prefix.

   Upon the intra-MAG Localrouting flag or intra-LMA Localrouting flag
   setup at the MAGs, one MAG may send the proxy binding update message
   to another MAG to establish corresponding binding cache associated
   with the MN and CN. Upon receiving Proxy Binding Update message, the
   MAG checks if the LocalRouting flag is set to one.  If the
   LocalRouting flag is not set to one, the MAG MUST reject the request
   and send a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message with the status
   field set to 129 (administratively prohibited).

    Upon accepting Proxy Binding Update request, the MAG MUST create a
    Binding Cache entry. The Source address of Proxy Binding Update is
    copied to Proxy CoA field of the binding cache entry. The Mobile
    node data (MN- Identifier, link-layer identifier, link-local address,
    home network prefixes, etc.) are copied from the corresponding
    fields of the proxy binding update.

   Upon accepting Proxy Binding Update request for the first time from
   another MAG, the MAG MUST establish a bi-directional tunnel between
   the two MAGs.  The tunnel endpoints are the Proxy-CoA of this mobile
   access gateway and the Proxy-CoA of the mobile access gateway that
   sent Proxy Binding Update as can be obtained from the source address
   of Proxy Binding Update.  This tunnel should be deleted when there
   are no mobile nodes sharing it or when mobile access gateway receives
   RORQ message from local mobility anchor with lifetime set to zero.

Internet-Draft  Proxy MIP Extension for local routing        July 2009


   When using IPv4 transport, the endpoints of the bi-directional tunnel
   are IPv4-Proxy-CoA of the mobile access gateway that sent Proxy
   Binding Update as can be obtained from the source address of Proxy
   Binding Update and IPv4-Proxy-CoA of this mobile access gateway with
   the encapsulation mode as specified in [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-
   support].

   For the data traffic between the MN and CN, on receiving a packet
   from a mobile node connected to its access link, to a destination
   that is directly connected or not directly connected, the MAG will
   lookup local routing flag and process traffic in terms of intra-MAG
   Localrouting flag or intra-LMA Localrouting flag. If the Intra-LMA
   LocalRouting flag is set to one and the destination address matches
   one of the home network prefixes in the binding cache, the packet
   must be forwarded to the Proxy CoA field in the binding cache entry
   as a tunneled packet. For the packet from a mobile node connected to
   its access link,to a destination that is also directly connected to
   the same access link, if the intra-MAG Localrouting flag is set to
   one, the packet must go directly via the MAG.

5.2. Local Mobility Anchor Consideration

   For the case where the MAG initiates local routing, upon receiving
   binding update message or routing optimization request message, the
   LMA will check LRI field in the routing optimization mobility option
   or routing optimization message. If LRI field is 1, the LMA will
   check whether there exists binding cache list for CN and whether MN's
   proxy CoA address is same as CN's proxy CoA address. If LRI field is
   0 and correspondent node's home network prefix included, the LMA will
   check whether there exists binding cache list for CN in terms of the
   correspondent node's home network prefix. If does, the LMA will
   respond to the MAG with LRI field set to value 2. Otherwise, the LMA
   will respond to the MAG with LRI field set to 0 in the routing
   optimization mobility option to indicate the MAG that the local
   routing optimization is not available. For the case where the LMA
   initiates local routing, upon perceiving intra-LMA routing, the LMA
   sends routing optimization request message with the LRI field set to
   value 2. And then the LMA receives routing optimization reply message
   from the corresponding MAG.


6. IPv4 support

    IPv4 support is needed in two cases:

      MN is IPv4 enabled and receives IPv4 home address and



Wu,et al.             Expires January 13, 2010               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft  Proxy MIP Extension for local routing        July 2009


      The transport network between the LMA and the MAG is an IPv4
      network.

    In both two cases, the encapsulation mode as described in [I-
    D.draft-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support] and NAT existing between the MAGs
    attached by the MN and CN respectively are transparent to the MAG
    concerned before setting up the localized routing path. This may
    result in data packets are dropped by the NAT between the concerned
    MAGs or the egress tunnel end point, i.e., the MAG.

    So local route optimization can be supported only if the
    encapsulated mode is aware and NAT Box is detected during setting up
    the localized routing path.

6.1. IPv4 HoA support

    In case MN is IPv4 enabled and receives IPv4 home address, both the
    MN and the CN configure global IPv4 home addresses by exchanging
    PBU/PBA as explained in [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support] with
    the LMA.

    The LMA MUST include IPv4 IPv4-MN-HoA in local routing optimization
    messages for both MN and CN. The LMA MAY include Home Network Prefix
    in PBA if the MN or CN is assigned Home Network Prefix. Both local
    routing optimization request and local routing optimization response
    messages are IPv6 messages and are transported over LMA-MAG tunnel
    as PBU and PBA are transported.

    The PBU and PBA exchanged between the MAGs are IPv6 messages and are
    transported as unencapsulated IPv6 messages between MAGs. Various
    encapsulation modes described in the [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-
    support] can be used in PBU and PBA and encapsulation mode
    negotiation between the MAGs is required If the MAGs in
    communication support different encapsulation mode. For
    simplification, we can assume the MAGs in communication are using
    the default encapsulation mode. Data traffic between the MAGs after
    local routing is established are transported in IPv6 inner packet as
    IPv4 payload.

6.2. IPv4 transport support

    In case IPv4 transport is used between the MAG and the LMA, LROREQ,
    LRORSP, PBU and PBA messages are transported as IPv6 messages using
    IPv4 or IPv4-UDP or IPv4-UDP-TLV encapsulation [I-D.ietf-netlmm-
    pmip6-ipv4-support].




Wu,et al.             Expires January 13, 2010               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft  Proxy MIP Extension for local routing        July 2009


    IPv4 data packets are transported in an IPv4 packet or encapsulated
    in IPv4-UDP/IPv4-UDP-TLV encapsulation. The NAT Detection option
    defined in [I-D.ietf-mext-nemo-v4traversal] can be used in the PBU
    and PBA between the MAGs to detect the on-path NAT device.



7. Inter-LMA Local routing Consideration

    In this section we concentrate on the local routing case where MN
    and CN are served by two different LMAs, in the same PMIPv6 domain
    which is not covered by the section 4 i.e.,Inter-LMA local routing.
   Two different cases is discussed below depending on who initiates
   Localrouting.

7.1. MAG Initiated Inter-LMA local routing

    The message exchange for the protocol is shown in Figure 6.

   Local routing case is triggered at one of the MAGs, e.g.  MAG1 when a
    datagram is received on its upstream interface whose destination
    address is a CN for which LMA2 has a binding cache entry. MAG1
    request LMA2 address from LMA1 by sending LROREQ message contain CN
    HNP or HoA to LMA1. LMA1 processes LROREQ message and lookup LMA2
    address based on CN HNP or HoA. There are one possible ways to
    achieve this goal.

    a. MAG1 can exchange with AAA server to retrieve LMA2 address.  MAG1
      sends CN address and asks the address of LMA2 which CN is anchored
      to.  The AAA server responds LMA2 address to MAG1.

   Upon retrieving LMA2 address, MAG1 then sends LROREQ message
    containing MN-CN pairs defined in the section 9.5 to LMA2. LMA2
    process LROREQ message and looks up MAG2 address based on CN HNP or
    HoA extracted from the corresponding message.
   In successful case, LMA2 responds to the MAG1 with MAG2 address
    corresponding to CN.

   MAG1 and MAG2 exchange PBU/PBA to establish binding cache list
    between each other and direct path between MAG1 and MAG2 is setup.

             Figure 6: MAG Initiated Inter-LMA Local routing


7.2. LMA Initiated Inter-LMA local routing

    The message exchange for the protocol is shown in Figure 7.

   Inter-LMA Local routing is triggered at one of the
   LMAs, e.g.  LMA1 when a datagram is received on its upstream
   interface whose destination address is a MN, e.g.  MN1 for which LMA1
   has a binding cache entry.  From the binding cache entry, LMA1
   determines the MAG address, e.g.  MAG1 (Proxy-CoA1).  LMA1 checks the
   source address to find out if the datagram is coming from a MN
   located in the same PMIPv6 domain and if yes, its MAG address, e.g.
   MAG2 (Proxy-CoA2).  There are several ways for doing this and the
   exact means is out of scope with the document.  Below we will mention
   two different ways.

   a. LMAs in the same PMIPv6 domain are configured with a table
    containing a list of /48, /32, etc. prefixes and the corresponding
    LMA address for all the LMAs in the domain.  LMA1 searches this
    table doing a longest prefix match based on the prefix part of the
    source address of MN2 and finds the corresponding LMA2 address.

   b. LMA1 can exchange with the AAA server to retrieve LMA2 address.
    LMA1 sends MN2 address and asks LMA address this MN is attached to.
    LMA1 receives LMA2 address and MAG address (Proxy-CoA2) from AAA
    server, e.g.DIAMETER server.

   LMA1 sends LMAROStartRequest message to LMA2.  LMAROStartRequest
   message contains MN1 and MN2 address and MAG1 address (Proxy-CoA1).
   MAG2 address is set to zero.  LMA2 searches its BCE for MN2 and

   determines MAG2 address (Proxy-CoA2).  LMA2 sends LMAROStartResponse
   message to LMA1.  LMAROStartResponse message contains MN1 and MN2
   address and MAG1 address (Proxy-CoA1) and MAG2 address (Proxy-CoA2).

   LMA1 sends LROREQ message to MAG1 at Proxy-CoA1.
   LROREQ message contains MN address and Proxy- CoA1 and CN
   address, e.g.  MN2 and Proxy-CoA2.  LMA2 sends LROREQ message
   to MAG2 at Proxy-CoA2.  LROREQ message contains CN address,
   e.g.  MN2 and Proxy-CoA2 and MN address, e.g.  MN1 and Proxy-CoA1.
   LROREQ messages enable both MAGs to modify their Binding
   Update Lists.  The two MAGs respond LROREQ with LRORSP
   messages.

   The two MAGs, MAG1 and MAG2 exchange PBU/PBAs as described in
   Section 4.

7.2.1. IPv4 Support Consideration

   IPv4 support presented in Section 8 also applies here. In addition,
   we discuss IPv4 support issues related to LMAROStartRequest and
   LMAStartResponse messages. LMAROStartRequest and LMAStartResponse
   messages are IPv6 messages.   These messages are transported in IPv6
   because LMAs support IPv6 and there is IPv6 transport established
   among LMAs in the same PMIPv6 domain.

8. Conceptual Data Structure Extension

8.1. Binding Update List Extension

   Every mobile access gateway maintains a Binding Update List. Each
   Entry in the Binding Update List represents a mobile node's mobility
   binding with its local mobility anchor, as described in Section 6.1
   of the PMIPv6 specification [RFC5213]. This specification extends the
   Binding Update List Entry data structure with the following
   additional fields:

       Intra-MAG LocalRouting Flag indicating whether the media delivery
   optimization is allowed by locally routing the packets within one MAG.
   The flag is set to value 1 for local media delivery optimization is
   allowed and vice versa.

       Intra-LMA LocalRouting Flag indicating whether the media delivery
   optimization is allowed by locally routing the packets from one MAG
   to another within one LMA. The flag is set to value 1 for local media
   delivery optimization is allowed and vice versa.

       Inter-LMA LocalRouting Flag indicating whether the media delivery
   optimization is allowed by locally routing the packets from one MAG
   served by one LMA to another MAG served by the different LMA. The
   flag is set to value 1 for local media delivery optimization is
   allowed and vice versa.

       Home network prefix assigned to Correspondent Node

       Proxy Care-of Address assigned to Correspondent Node

8.2. Binding Cache Entry Extension

    Every local mobility anchor MUST maintain a Binding Cache entry for
    each currently registered mobile node. For supporting this
    specification, the Binding Cache Entry data structure needs to be
    extended with the following additional field:

       Inra-LMA LocalRouting Flag indicating whether the media delivery
   optimization is allowed by locally routing the packets from one MAG
   to another within one LMA. The flag is set to value 1 for local media
   delivery optimization is allowed and vice versa.

       Inter-LMA LocalRouting Flag indicating whether the media delivery
   optimization is allowed by locally routing the packets from one MAG
   served by one LMA to another MAG served by the different LMA. The

    A new MH type should be assigned by IANA.

   Status
      An 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the disposition of
      LMAROStartReq message by the receiving LMA.  Values less than 128
      indicate that ROStartReq message was accepted by the LMA.  Values
      greater than 128 indicate that LMAROStartReq message was rejected
      by LMA.

   Sequence number and Lifetime fields are as defined above for
   LMAROStartReq message.

   Mobility Options contain pairs of MN-CN RO Option as defined in
   Section 6.4.  The LMA must copy this field from LMAROStartReq message
   when status field contains a value indicating success. The LMA MUST
   search its binding cache for the Home Network Prefix value of CN and
   find the corresponding MAG address, e.g.  Proxy-CoA2. Th LMA MUST
   replace MAG address field set to zero by the sending LMA with Proxy-
   CoA2.


10. Security Considerations

    The protocol specified in this document can use the security
    association between the LMA and the MAG to create security
    association between MAGs to which MN and CN attach in the intra-LMA
    local routing scenario. As regarding intra-MAG local routing
    scenario, integrity protection can be considered and confidentiality
    using IPsec is not necessary.

11. IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
