                  RO Extensions for PMIPv6-LR (ROEXT)

Abstract

   The communication path between two Hosts within a Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain is artificially long - it involves the LMA, even if straight
   paths exist (under same MAG, or MAG-to-MAG).  Localized Routing
   PMIPv6-LR concepts developped by NETEXT WG make use of LRI/LRA
   messages to achieve optimized MAG-to-MAG straight paths.  This may
   prove inconvenient for the network operator, in that it may loose
   ability to control traffic (LMA is skipped).

   In this draft we present a middle-ground solution.  It employs new
   Intermediary Anchors (IAs) in the paths between MAGs and offers
   points of control of traffic useful for QoS and lawful interception.

2.  Concentrated Description

   The work presented in this draft is developped in the context of
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] and uses LRI/LRA messages used by
   Localized Routing [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip-lr].

   The relevant scenarios are represented by communication between two
   Hosts typically situated each under a different MAG.

   In this figure, on the left side, the established tunnels T1 and T2
   for communication between Host1 and Host2 are shown, after the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 protocol has executed.  Each tunnel is established
   between LMA and the MAG under which a Host is attached.  This
   illustration is typically used to express a problem of too long
   communication paths.

   In the right part of the same figure, the Direct Tunnel between two
   MAGs is illustrated as a solution to the problem above.  This is
   achieved by using Localized Routing concepts of Proxy Mobile IPv6.
   The diagonal lines represent signalling (not wires).

   There may exist situations when MAG-LMA-MAG communication paths are
   too long and yet the straight MAG-MAG paths may prove disadvantageous
   in terms of loss of operator control on various aspects of the
   traffic.  A middle ground solution as for an bent arch path (not
   fully triangular, not fully straight) may be needed.

   In this figure a new entity is added between MAGs - the Intermediate
   Anchor (IA).  The tunnels T1 and T2 are established between the IA
   and the two MAGs respectively (instead of LMA).  The IA serves
   purposes such as ensuring a certain level of control over the route
   optimized traffic, such as providing a certain level of Quality-of-
   Service, or, potentially, enabling data traffic enforcement for
   lawful interception.  Several such IAs may be placed at strategic
   points within the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.
