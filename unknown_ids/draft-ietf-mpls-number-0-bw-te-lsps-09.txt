   Engineering (TE) in order to advertise some link characteristics such
   as the available bandwidth, traffic engineering metric,
   administrative group and so on.  By making statistical assumption
   about the aggregated traffic carried onto a set of TE Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) signalled with zero bandwith (referred to as
   unconstrained TE LSP in this document), and with the knowledge of the
   number of unconstrained TE LSPs signalled across a link, algorithms
   can be designed to load balance (existing or newly configured)
   unconstrained TE LSP across a set of equal cost paths.  This requires
   knowledge of the number of unconstrained TE LSPs signalled across a
   link.  This document specifies a new Link-type Traffic Engineering
   sub-TLV used to advertise the number of unconstrained TE LSP(s)
   signalled across a link.

   Terminology used in this document

   IGP : Interior Gateway Protocol

   LSA: Link State Advertisement

   LSP: Link State Packet

   MPLS: Multiprotocol Label Switching

   LSR: Label Switching Router

   SRLG: Shared Risk Link Group

2.  Introduction

   It is not uncommon to deploy MPLS Traffic Engineering for the sake of
   fast recovery relying on a local protection recovery mechanism such
   as MPLS TE Fast Reroute (see [RFC4090]).  In this case, a deployment
   model consists of deploying a full mesh of TE LSPs signalled with
   zero bandwidth (also referred to as unconstrained TE LSP in this
   document) between a set of LSRs (Label Switching Routers) and
   protecting these TE LSPs against link, SRLG (Shared Risk Link Group)
   and/or node failures with pre-established backup tunnels.  The
   traffic routed onto such unconstrained TE LSPs simply follows the IGP
   shortest path (since the TE LSP computed by the path computation
   algorithm (e.g.  CSPF) will be no different than the IGP (Interior
   Gateway Protocol) shortest path should the TE metric be equal to the
   IGP metric) but is protected with MPLS TE Fast Reroute.

   When a reoptimization process is triggered for an existing TE LSP,
   the decision on whether to reroute that TE LSP onto a different path
   is governed by the discovery of a lower cost path satisfying the
   constraints (other metric such that the percentage of reserved
   bandwidth or the number of hops can also be used).  Unfortunately,
   for instance in the presence of ECMPs (Equal Cost Multi-Paths) in
   symmetrical networks when unconstrained TE LSPs are used, such
   metrics (e.g. path cost, number of hops, ...) are usually ineffective
   and may lead to poorly load balanced traffic.

   By making statistical assumption about the aggregated traffic carried
   by a set of TE LSPs signalled with no bandwidth requirement (referred
   to as unconstrained TE LSPs in this document), algorithms can be
   designed to load balance (existing or newly configured) unconstrained
   TE Label Switched Path (LSP) across a set of equal cost paths.  This
   requires knowledge of the number of unconstrained Traffic Engineering
   Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) signalled across each link.

   Note that the specification of load balancing algorithms is outside
   the scope of this document and is referred to for the sake of
   illustration of the motivation for gathering such information.

   Furthermore, the knowledge of the number of unconstrained TE LSPs
   signalled across each link can be used for other purposes (for
   example to evaluate the number of affected unconstrained TE LSPs in
   case of a link failure).

   A set of Link-type sub-TLVs have been defined for OSPF and IS-IS (see
   [RFC3630] and [RFC3784]) in the context of MPLS Traffic Engineering
   in order to advertise various link characteristics such as the
   available bandwidth, traffic engineering metric, administrative group
   and so on.  As currently defined in [RFC3630] and [RFC3784] the
   information related to the number of unconstrained TE LSP(s) is not
   available.  This document specifies a new Link-type Traffic
   Engineering sub-TLV used to indicate the number of unconstrained TE
   LSPs signalled across a link.

   Unconstrained TE LSPs that are configured and provisioned through a
   management system MAY be omitted from the count that is reported.


3.  Protocol extensions

   The Unconstrained TE LSPs count sub-TLV is defined that specifies the
   number of TE LSPs signalled with zero bandwidth across a link.

3.1.  IS-IS

   The IS-IS Unconstrained TE LSP Count Sub-TLV is OPTIONAL and MUST NOT
   appear more than once within the extended IS reachability TLV (type
   22) specified in [RFC3784].  If a second instance of the
   Unconstrained TE LSP Count sub-TLV is present, the receiving system
   MUST only process the first instance of the sub-TLV.

   The IS-IS Unconstrained TE LSP Count Sub-TLV format is defined below:

   Type (1 octet): To be assigned by IANA (suggested value = 23)

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-mpls-number-0-bw-te-lsps-09    February 2008


   Length (1 octet): 2

   Value (2 octets): number of unconstrained TE LSP(s) signalled across
   the link.

3.2.  OSPF

   The OSPF Unconstrained TE LSP Count TLV is OPTIONAL and MUST NOT
   appear more than once within the Link TLV (Type 2) that is itself
   carried within the Traffic Engineering LSA specified in [RFC3630] or
   the OSPFv3 Intra-Area-TE LSA (function code 10) defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-traffic].  If a second instance of the
   Unconstrained TE LSP Count sub-TLV is present, the receiving system
   MUST only process the first instance of the sub-TLV.

   The OSPF Unconstrained TE LSP Count Sub-TLV format is defined below:

   Type (2 octets): To be assigned by IANA (suggested value = 23)

   Length (2 octets): 4

   Value (4 octets): number of unconstrained TE LSP(s) signalled across
   the link.


4.  Elements of procedure

   The absence of the Unconstrained TE LSP Count (sub-)TLV should be
   interpreted as an absence of information about the link.

   Similarly to other MPLS Traffic Engineering link characteristics,
   LSA/LSP origination trigger mechanisms are outside the scope of this
   document.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has defined a sub-registry for the sub-TLVs carried in the IS-IS
   TLV 22.  IANA is requested to assign a new TLV code-point for the
   Unconstrained TE LSP Count sub-TLV carried within the TLV 22.

   IANA has defined a sub-registry for the sub-TLVs carried in an OSPF
   TE Link TLV (type 2).  IANA is requested to assign a new sub-TLV
   code-point for the Unconstrained TE LSP Count sub-TLV carried within

6.  Security Considerations

   The function described in this document does not create any new
   security issues for the OSPF and the IS-IS protocols.  Security
   considerations are covered in [RFC2328] and [RFC2470] for the base
   OSPF protocol and in [RFC1195] for IS-IS.
