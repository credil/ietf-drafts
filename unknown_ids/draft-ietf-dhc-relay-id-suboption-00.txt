Abstract

   This memo defines a new Relay Agent Identifier suboption for the
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol's (DHCP) Relay Agent Information
   option.  The suboption carries a unique identifier configured or
   generated at the relay agent.  The suboption allows a DHCP relay
   agent to include the unique identifier in the DHCP messages it sends.

Internet-Draft        The Relay Agent Id Suboption             June 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) [RFC2131]
   provides IP addresses and configuration information for IPv4 clients.
   It includes a relay agent capability, in which network elements
   receive broadcast messages from clients and forward them to DHCP
   servers as unicast messages.  In many network environments, relay
   agents add information to the DHCP messages before forwarding them,
   using the Relay Agent Information option [RFC3046].  Servers that
   recognize the relay information option echo it back in their replies.

   DHCP typically identifies clients based on information in their DHCP
   messages - such as the Client-Identifier option, or the value of the
   chaddr field.  In some networks, however, the location of a client,
   its point of attachment to the network, is a more useful identifier.
   In factory-floor networks (commonly called 'Industrial' networks),
   for example, the role a device plays is often fixed and based on its
   location.  Using manual address configuration is possible (and is
   common), but it would be beneficial if DHCP configuration could be
   applied to these networks.

   One way to provide connection-based identifiers for industrial
   networks is to have the network elements acting as DHCP relay agents
   supply information that the DHCP server can use as a client
   identifier.  A straightforward way to form identifier information is
   to combine something that is unique within the scope of the network
   element with something that uniquely identifies that network element.
   There are several possibilities, but to improve interoperability we
   describe a dedicated identifier that can be associated with the
   network element and conveyed in a consistent way.

   This specification introduces a Relay Agent Identifier suboption for
   the Relay Information option.  The Relay-Id suboption carries an
   sequence of octets that is intended to identify the relay agent
   uniquely within the administrative domain.  The identifier may be
   administratively configured: in some networks it may be adequate to
   assign strings such as "switch1" and "switch2".  Alternatively, the
   identifier may be generated by the relay agent itself, and we specify
   an algorithm from [RFC3315] for this purpose.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   DHCPv4 terminology is defined in [RFC2131], and the DHCPv4 Relay

   Agent Information Option in [RFC3046].  DUID terminology is in
   [RFC3315].


3.  Suboption Format

   Format of the Relay Agent Identifier suboption:


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |SUBOPT_RELAY_ID|   length      |                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+     id (variable)             |
       .                                                               .
       .                                                               .
       .                                                               .
       +---------------------------------------------------------------+

       Where:

       SUBOPT_RELAY_ID   [TBD]
       length            the number of octets in the identifier; the
                         minimum length is one.
       id                'length' octets of identifier



4.  Generating a Relay Identifier

   As described in Section 1, in some situations it may be useful for
   network devices to generate identifiers themselves.  Relay agents who
   send the Relay Agent Identifier suboption using identifiers that are
   not administratively-configured MUST be generated following the
   procedures in the DUID section of [RFC3315].  Relay agents who use
   generated identifiers should make the generated value available to
   their administrators via their user-interface, through a log entry,
   or through some other mechanism.


5.  Security Considerations

   Security issues with the Relay Agent Information option and its use
   by servers in address assignment are discussed in [RFC3046] and
   [RFC4030].  Relay agents who send the Relay Agent Identifier
   suboption SHOULD use the Relay Agent Authentication suboption
   [RFC4030] to provide integrity protection.

6.  IANA Considerations

   We request that IANA assign a new suboption code from the registry of
   DHCP Agent Sub-Option Codes maintained in
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/bootp-dhcp-parameters.
