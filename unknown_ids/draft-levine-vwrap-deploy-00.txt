   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   This draft is an extension and follow on draft to OGPX layering and
   architectural patterns, draft-levine-ogp-layering-00

   This note focuses on design patterns and architectural choices which
   will permit the VWRAP specifications to adapt to a wide range of
   deployment patterns, within the basic VWRAP remit, and support the
   use of policy to permit the architecture to enable virtual spaces
   with very different policies toward security, intellectual property,
   identity, and economics to share common infrastructure and to
   interoperate in a principled fashion.

   This draft includes patterns for assembling VWRAP services into
   usable systems and patterns for alternative implmentations of various
   VWRAP services to allow varying approaches to service and content
   delivery.  This draft is intended to focus attention on the service
   design choices which will allow a single specification to support a
   range of deployed services.


3.  Mechanisms, Services, Domains, Policy

   When completed, the VWRAP specifications will define:

   o  a set of underlying service delivery mechanisms

   o  a set of services delivered over these mechanisms

   o  clusters of related services, called domains

   o  mechanisms to apply policy to specific services

   The model of "domain" is not fully defined in the current
   specifications.Several possible approaches to defining "domains" or
   "clusters" are described here, in hope of stimulating agreement on a
   concise definition.

   The most commonly mentioned partition of services into domains is the
   split between "agent" and "region" domains proposed by Linden Lab.
   This partition separates services associated with the user's identity

   and information, the "agent domain," from services associated with
   virtual space, the "region domain"

   In order to discuss patterns of clustering and service delivery, it
   is necessary to discuss what is mean by "domain" and also look more
   deeply into both the notions of a cluster of services, and also
   discuss possible deployment patterns


4.  Servers, Services and Named entities

   In order to avoid confusion, in this note, we will define a number of
   terms very precisely:

   o  Service: a named set of REST style resources which accepts a
      series of messages to perform a task.  We explicitly do not mean a
      deployed service such as the Second Life(tm) service.

   o  Server: A computer offering up one or more named services

   o  Region: A named portion of virtual space.  A Region is the
      addressable focus

   o  Agent: The state and services representing a user within the
      virtual world

   o  Policy: A described behavior of a service within the VWRAP
      specications.

   o  Avatar: A visual representation of an Agent within the virtual
      world.

   o  Asset: A set of digitial content with a visual and logical
      component which can be added to a region (and implicitly its
      simulatoin creating a simulated artifact.  Assets include
      textures, Primtive objects, landscapes and related artifacts.

   o  Primitive Objects: A data structure describing a visual component
      in a simulatoin.  Historically these have been constructive
      geometric objects in Second Life like worlds, but the VWRAP
      specifications assume that the set of defined primtive objects
      will grow to include meshes and other forms of geometric markup.

   o  Simulation: The process of modeling the elements of a virtual
      region.  The computatinal processing which creates a series of
      sucessive scenes containing the Avatars, and Assets within a
      region.

5.  Deployment patterns

   To motivate the discussion, we will describe several deployment
   patterns for VWRAP based systems.  Each of these deployment patterns
   should be viewed as a use case for the VWRAP specifications.  The
   specifications should provide sufficient expresivity of service
   endpoints, and trust boundaries to support all of the described
   patterns.

5.1.  Second Life Agent Domain / Region Domain Split

   This deployment pattern represents the pattern Linden Lab proposed in
   its initial discussions on second generation architecture in 2007.
   It offloads any services which are not germane to managing a virtual
   space to an "agent" domain, focused, on the services which are
   specific, not to the virtual space, but the user's agent.

   In this pattern, the viewer is typically connected to one or more
   regions, and one agent domain.  The agent domain acts as a unitary
   focus for all services associated with the agent.  When accessing
   other services hosted by a deployer other than the hoster of the
   agent domain, the agent domain acts as the trust source, managing the
   agent (and user's) access to other regions.

   In this deployment pattern, back end services, such as assets and
   inventory are accessed via the agent domain, do not, inhenrently have
   thier own event queue or trust domain.

5.2.  Standalone OpenSim Region model

   In the Standalone OpenSim deployment model, all of the services
   comprising a Region, an Agent Domain, and the supporting services
   used by these services are hosted on a single server.  A single event
   queue may manage connectivity to the services, or several event
   queues, with the services being hosted as seperate processes within
   the server.

   Historically, a standalone OpenSim represents a single fully trusted
   domain, where there are no seperate trust components or policies.

5.3.  OpenSim VWRAP + Asset reflector + Agent Service

   In this deployment pattern, one or more OpenSim regions are hosted,
   each as a seperate server.  An seperate agent domain acts as the
   trust authority, and login component for the deployment.  Inventory
   and Asset requests are reflected from individual regions to asset and
   inventory services, hosted either in a standalone fashion, or as part
   of an OpenSim region.

Internet-Draft              VWRAP Deployment               February 2010


5.4.  OpenSim UGAIM grid model

   This is the current (Soon to be deprecated) OpenSim Grid model.  In
   this model, a seperate login service (not an agent domain) is hosted
   on one server ans a collection of backend services are shared by one
   or more Region Simulators.  The entire grid forms a single trust
   model.

5.5.  Hypergrid

   In this model, each Region is hosted in either Standalone, or UGAIM
   style Grid mode.  Specific links between regions are created, which
   define a two way mapping, permitting users to move thier avatars
   between the regions.  Service requests related to the back end
   servcies for these avatars are directed back to the originating
   service.  Trust, if any is established in the process of creating the
   explicit link between the regions.

5.6.  Hypergrid and Cable Beach

   Hypergrid can be combined with cable beach, so that assets are
   fetched directly from a shared asset server, and trust between the
   asset server, and between the regions and the user is managed by the
   client directly.

5.7.  Multi-hosted asset deployment

   This is a case in which there are multiple back ends supporting
   multiple sets of assets.  Trust is established either per the Agent
   Domain model, between services, and the agent's agent domain, or
   between regions, in hpyergrid fashion, or directly between the client
   and the asset services, per the cable beach model.

5.8.  Factored Service Models

   There is nothing inherent in the requirements of a virtual world
   deployment that specific back end services be clustered into two
   domains, nor that a single server or logical endpoint host all of the
   services which comprise a deployment.  Cloud deployed servics may be
   used to host part or all of a VWRAP deployment.  In such a deployment
   model, services deployed within a cloud may deploy one or more event
   queue endpoints or service and trust endopints to connect to clients.

   Factoring of services is not exclusive to back end services, the
   agent domain, or regions.  Deployment models in which regions share
   services, or in which the services comprising a region are deployed
   on a distributed computuing fabric should be supported.

6.  Possible Domain definitions

   Given the above set of deployment patterns several possible ways of
   usefully defining "domain" seem possible.

   One could conclude that the specification should ignore domain as a
   structuring concept and instead focus on descbing the services needed
   to deliver the desired results, and allow domain patterns to be
   entirely deployment artifacts.

   One could focus on shared infrastructural elements.  In such a model
   domains might be defined by sharing a common set of seed caps, or a
   common event queue.

   Security and adminsitration form another possible way of deliniating
   domains.  It is ucnlear if this differs in a meaningful way from the
   first choice, as adminsitrative domains tend to be purely artifacts
   of deployers.


7.  Trust and policy issues

7.1.  Policy Requirements

   Policy decisions may be made by services on the basis of:

   o  End user identity token

   o  Requesting Service identity token

   o  Service specific token (Proof of license, proof of TOS signature,
      etc.)

   In order to permit policy decisions to be made by services, a number
   of token may presented to the service.  These tokens will likely be
   supported as optional additions to the protocols, inserted in slots
   in the protocol messages defined by the services.  This permits
   services to optionally require additional inputs in order to satisfy
   thier policy requirments in a predictcable and princpled fashion.

7.2.  Grid Access authentication

   One policy choice grid deployers may make, is to require a login or
   authentications to be made to the grid's authentication service or
   agent domain.  Several emerging internet approaches, such as openId
   or OAuth are possible mechanisms which may be used to satisfy this
   need.

7.3.  Content Management

   One of the challanges facing a virtual worlds envrionment is
   determiing how digital content should be shared.  The VWRAP
   specifications split this problem into mechansisms and policies.  The
   following sections focus on describing several approachs and the
   places they impinge on the mechanisms being defined in VWRAP.

   Content Management includes, but is not limited to:

   o  Labeling content with meta data to facilitate its management

   o  Identifying policy enforcement points for content management

   o  other XXX

7.3.1.  content flows through VWs



        +-------+              +----------+                    +-------+
Insertion->| Asset Store |--"rez" --->|  Region  |--Present--->| client|
        --------+              +----------+                    +-------+


   This diagram describes some of the key moments as a dgital item flows
   through a virtual world.  The item is inserted into and stored within
   the virtual world's services.  It is then added to a virtual world's
   region (rezzed), which makes it available for simulation and, finally
   presented to client(s) for viewing.

   Notice that this is notional.  How the various services are deployed
   and where trust boundaries might be placed is not described.
   Temporally the insertion, "rez" and presentation are seperable by
   arbitrary amounts of time (including none).  Insertion may be from an
   external library, a tool chain, or other services.  It is the moment
   when the content in question enters into the purview of the virtual
   world.

   The process of adding an item to a virtual region, copies some or all
   of its content.  This may be as little as a reference to the actual
   item and an extremly simplified representatoin for physical
   simulation, or it may be a complete copy of the item in all of its
   particulars.  The most common implementatoin has the entire item
   copied to the regoin for simulation, and delivery to the client.

7.3.1.1.  Content delivery models

   A range of possible represenations can be passed to a regoin for
   simulation.  Full content can be passed to regions, or a subset of
   content, or only references to most content.  The VWRAP
   specifications should permit as broad a range of content delivery
   models as possible.

   One end of the spectrum involved passing the full content, including
   the full geometric description, and all the information necessary for
   a client to render the content, the information necessary to simulate
   the object at a physical level, and any scripted attachments which
   automate the behavior of the item.

   The other end of the delivery spectrum involves passing only a URI or
   capability used to access the rendering information and a collision
   mesh,and related data for physical simulation.  In such a model, the
   client is responsible for fetching the additional informatoin needed
   to render the item's visual presence from a seperate service.  This
   fetch can be done under the credentials of the end user viewing the
   material, and divorces the simulation from the trust chain needed to
   manage content.  Any automation is done on a seperate host which the
   content creator or owner trusts, interacting with the object through
   remoted interfaces.

7.3.1.2.  multiple representations

   A second mechanism for managing content delivery is to provide
   multiple versions of an item, and pass different versions, depending
   on the trust level which exists between two services.  Such a model
   can be applied at all the steps in the VWRAP protocols.  An asset
   server may host multiple versions of an object and pass appropriate
   versions to requestors.  A regoin coudl be sent multiple
   representations of an item, and pass the appropriate one down to
   clients based on the relationship between the client and the region.
   Alternative content can be used to account for degrees of trust as
   well as richness of a given client.  Multiple representations can be
   combined with redirection to permit a low fidelity version to be
   distributed widely, with a reference to a higher quality version
   which can be fetched directly should the end user be authorized.

7.4.  Content Metadata

   Content meta data for content management allows the content creator

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


9.  Security Considerations

   This draft primarily defines requirements and use cases, as well as a
   description of policy management approaches.  Policy management
   includes control of choices which affect security.  To the extent
   that requirements and use cases permit poor security choices to be
   made when deploying services security of a deployed system could be
   compromised by those considerations.
