         <t>The IETF emergency services architecture assumes that the calling device has acquired
            rights to use the access network or that no authentication is required for the access
            network, such as for public wireless access points. Subsequent protocol interactions,
            such as obtaining location information, learning the address of the Public Safety
            Answering Point (PSAP) and the emergency call itself are largely decoupled from the
            underlying network access procedures.</t>
         <t>In some cases, however, the device does not have these credentials for network access, 
            does not have a VoIP service provider, or the credentials have become
            invalid, e.g., because the user has exhausted their prepaid balance or the account has
            expired.</t>
         <t>This document provides a problem statement, introduces terminology and describes an
            extension for the base IETF emergency services architecture to address these scenarios.

      <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
         <t> Summoning police, the fire department or an ambulance in emergencies is one of the
            fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone. As telephone functionality moves
            from circuit-switched telephony to Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that
            this core functionality will continue to work at least as well as it has for the older
            technology. New devices and services are being made available that could be used to make
            a request for help, which are not traditional telephones, and users are increasingly
            expecting them to be used to place emergency calls.</t>
         <t> Roughly speaking, the IETF emergency services architecture (see <xref
               target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework"/>)
            divides responsibility for handling emergency calls between the access network (ISP),
            the application service provider (ASP) that may be a VoIP service provider and the
            provider of emergency signaling services, the emergency service network (ESN). The
            access network may provide location information to end systems, but does not have to
            provide any ASP signaling functionality. The emergency caller can reach the ESN either
            directly or through the ASP's outbound proxy. Any of the three parties can provide the
            mapping from location to PSAP URI by offering LoST <xref target="RFC5222"/> services.</t>
         <t> In general, a set of automated configuration mechanisms allows a device to function in
            a variety of architectures, without the user being aware of the details on who provides
            location, mapping services or call routing services. However, if emergency calling is to
            be supported when the calling device lacks access network authorization or does not have
            an ASP, one or more of the providers may need to provide additional services and
            functions. </t>
         <t> In all cases, the end device has to be able to perform a LoST lookup and otherwise
            conduct the emergency call in the same manner as when the three exceptional conditions
            discussed below do not apply.</t>
         <t> We distinguish between three conditions: </t>
         <t>
            <list style="hanging">
               <t hangText="No Access Authentication (NAA):">                      
              In the NAA case, the emergency caller does not posses valid credentials for the 
              access network. This includes the case where the access network allows pay-per-use, 
              as is common for wireless hotspots, but there is insufficient time to enter credit 
              card details and other registration information required for access. It also covers
			  all cases where either no credentials are available at all, or the available
			  credentials do not work for the given IAP/ISP. As a result, the NAA case basically
			  combines the below NASP and ZBP cases, but at the IAP/ISP level. Support for 
              emergency call handling in the NAA case is subject to the local policy of the ISP. 
              Such policy may vary substantially between ISPs and typically depends on external 
              factors that are not under the ISP control.<vspace blankLines="1"/>
               </t>
               <t hangText="No ASP (NASP):"> The caller does not have an
              ASP at the time of the call. This can occur either in case the caller does not
              possess any valid subscription for a reachable ASP, or in case none of the ASPs
              where the caller owns a valid subscription is reachable through the ISP. 
                  <vspace blankLines="1"/>
              Note: The interoperability need is increased with this scenario since the client 
              software used by the emergency caller must be compatible with the  
              protocols and extensions deployed by the ESN.<vspace blankLines="1"/>
               </t>
               <t hangText="Zero-balance ASP (ZBP):"> 
               In the case of zero-balance ASP, the ASP can authenticate the
               caller, but the caller is not authorized to use ASP services, e.g., because
               the contract has expired or the prepaid account for the customer has been depleted.
                  <vspace blankLines="1"/>
               </t>
            </list>
         </t>
         
         <t>These three cases are not mutually exclusive. A caller in need for help may find himself/herself 
            in, for example, a NAA and NASP situation, as explained in more details in 
            <xref target="flow"/>. Depending on local
            policy and regulations, it may not be possible to place emergency calls in the NAA case.
            Unless local regulations require user identification, it should always be possible to
            place calls in the NASP case, with minimal impact on the ISP. Unless the ESN requires
            that all calls traverse a known set of VSPs, it is technically possible to let a caller place an
            emergency call in the ZBP case. We discuss each case in more details in 
            <xref target="categories"/>. </t>

         <t>Note: At the time of writing there is no regulation in place that demands the functionality
            described in this memo. SDOs have started their work on this subject in a proactive
            fashion in the anticipation that national regulation will demand it for a subset of
            network environments.</t>
         <t>There are also indications that the functionality of unauthenticated emergency calls
            (called SIM-less calls) in today's cellular system in certain countries leads to a fair
            amount of hoax or test calls. This causes overload situations at PSAPs which is
            considered harmful to the overall availability and reliability of emergency services.</t>
         <t>
         <t>As an example, Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM, Switzerland) provided
            statistics about emergency (112) calls in Switzerland from Jan. 1997 to Nov. 2001.
            Switzerland did not offer SIM-less emergency calls except for almost a month in 
            July 2000 where a significant increase in hoax and test calls was reported. As a
            consequence, the functionality was disabled again. More details can be found in
            the panel presentations of the 3rd SDO Emergency Services Workshop <xref target="esw07"/>.</t>

 <t> On a very high-level, the steps to
            be performed by an end host not being attached to
            the network and the user starting to make an emergency call are the following: </t>
         <t>
            <list style="hanging">
               <t hangText="Link Layer Attachment:">Some radio networks have added support for 
                  unauthenticated emergency access, some
                  other type of networks advertise these capabilities using layer beacons. The end
                  host learns about these unauthenticated emergency services capabilities either
                  from the link layer type or from advertisement.
                  <vspace blankLines="1"/> 
                  The end host uses the link layer specific network attachment procedures defined
                  for unauthenticated network access in order to get access to the network. 
                  <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
               <t hangText="Pre-Emergency Service Configuration:">
                  When the link layer network attachment procedure is completed the end host learns
                  basic configuration information using DHCP from the ISP, including the address of
                  the LoST server.
                  The end host uses a Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) to retrieve location 
                  information. Subsequently, the LoST protocol <xref target="RFC5222"/> is used to 
                  learn the relevant emergency numbers, and to obtain the 
                  PSAP URI applicable for that location.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
               <t hangText="Emergency Call:"> 
                  In case of need for help, a user dials an emergency number and the SIP UA initiates 
                  the emergency call procedures by communicating with the PSAP.</t>

      <section anchor="zbp-considerations" title="ZBP Considerations">
         <t>Although subject to local regulatory mandates, it is expected that for most
		 ASPs even with a lack of authorization for regular service an otherwise
		 authenticated and known subscriber must be granted access to emergency services. 
		 Naturally, without an obligation to support emergency services in ZBP cases an
		 ASP can simply disallow access by such customers. As a result, all such 
		 subscribers may fall back into a NASP situation as described above. <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
		 <t>If ASPs desire or are required by regulation to provide emergency services
		 to subscribers with valid credentials that only fail authorization, the 
		 emergency services nature of a call can easily be determined by inspecting 
		 the call setup procedure for the presence of the emergency service URNs. This
		 example shows that in the context of this document no specific considerations
		 apply to the ZBP case due to the fact that the ASP will be able to relate the
		 service request to an existing subscription or user and will be in control of
		 adjusting any authorization decision based on its deployemnt specific policy.
		 It is, however, noted that specific security considerations apply due to the 
		 fact that emergency service access will likely be granted with limited
		 authorization only, see <xref target="secconsiderations"/>.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
         <t>ZBP cases in the context of this document cover all cases where an otherwise
		 valid subscription lacks authorization to access or regular ASP services, i.e.,
		 a lack of authorization that would block the subscriber from using the service
		 for emergency purpose. Example ZBP cases include empty prepaid accounts, barred
		 accounts, or certain roaming or mobility restrictions. The exact list of cases
		 where emergency services need to be supported by the ASP is local to the ASP 
		 policy and deployment, and is therefore beyond the scope of this document.</t>

                  This step is outside the scope of this section.</t>
               <t>When the link layer network attachment procedure is completed the end host learns
                  basic configuration information using DHCP from the ISP, including the address of
                  the ESRP, as shown in step (2).</t>
               <t>When the IP address configuration is completed then the SIP UA initiates a SIP

                  determined using a protocol interaction shown in (4).</t>
               <t>Potentially, an interaction between the LCS of the ISP and the LCS of the IAP may
                  be necessary, see (5).</t>
               <t>Finally, the correct PSAP for the location of the end host has to be evaluated,
                  see (6).</t>
               <t>The ESRP routes the call to the PSAP, as shown in (7).</t>
               <t>The PSAP evaluates the initial INVITE and aims to complete the call setup. </t>
               <t>Finally, when the call setup is completed media traffic can be exchanged between

            </list>
         </t>
         <t>For editorial reasons the end-to-end SIP and media exchange between the PSAP and SIP UA
            are not shown in <xref target="arch-fig"/>.</t>

         <t>Two important aspects are worth to highlight: </t>
         <t>
            <list style="symbols">
               <t>The IAP/ISP needs to understand the concept of emergency calls or other emergency
                  applicationsand the SIP profile described in this document. No other VoIP protocol
                  profile, such as XMPP, Skype, etc., are supported for emergency calls in this
                  particular architecture. Other profiles may be added in the future, but the
                  deployment effort is enormous since they have to be universally deployed. </t>
               <t>The end host has no obligation to determine location information. It may attach
                  location information if it has location available (e.g., from a GPS receiver).</t>
            </list>

         </t>
         <t><xref target="arch-fig"/> shows that the ISP needs to deploy SIP-based emergency
            services functionality. It is important to note that the ISP itself may outsource the
            functionality by simply providing access to them (e.g., it puts the IP address of an
            ESRP or a LoST server into an allow-list). For editorial reasons this outsourcing is not
            shown.</t>

              policy decisions typically happen at a different layers of the protocol stack and in
              different entities than those terminating the link-layer signaling. As a result, link
              layer indications need to be distributed and translated between the different involved
              protocol layers and entities. Appropriate methods are specific to the actual
              architecture of the IAP/ISP network.</t>

          </t>
         </section>

         <section title="Higher-Layer Emergency Indication">
         <t>This section focuses on emergency indications based on authentication and authorization
            in EAP-based network access.</t>
         <t>An advantage of combining emergency indications with the actual network attachment
            procedure performing authentication and authorization is the fact that the emergency
            indication can directly be taken into account in the authentication and authorization
            server that owns the policy for granting access to the network resources. As a result,
            there is no direct dependency on the access network architecture that otherwise would
            need to take care of merging link-layer indications into the AA and policy decision
            process.</t>
         <t>EAP signaling happens at a relatively early stage of network attachment, so it is likely
            to match most requirements for prioritization of emergency signaling. However, it does
            not cover early stages of link layer activity in the network attachment process.
            Possible conflicts may arise e.g. in case of MAC-based filtering in entities terminating
            the link-layer signaling in the network (like a base station). In normal operation, EAP
            related information will only be recognized in the NAS. Any entity residing between end
            host and NAS should not be expected to understand/parse EAP messages.</t>
         <t>The following potential methods to provide emergency indications in combination with
            EAP-based network attachment, are recognized:</t>

         <t><list style="numbers"> 
         
         <t>NAI-based emergency indication: <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            An emergency indication can be given by forming a specific NAI that is used as the
            identity in EAP based authentication for network entry. Methods include:
         </t>
         <t>
            <list style="hanging"> 
            <t hangText="1.a) NAI Decoration:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
            NAI decoration is commonly used in routing EAP responses within
            the IAP/ISP AAA infrastructure. Additional decoration can be used to add an indication
            that the network attachment attempt is meant for accessing emergency services.
            Potential advantages of such approach include that it requires only minimal realization
            effort compared to link-layer indications with good integration into the authentication
            and authorization procedures. The same procedure can be used for all NAA cases (both
            unauthenticated and unauthorized) as well as for normal attachment with a valid 
            subscription.
            A potential disadvantage is that such EAP decoration is not globally defined across all
            different access technologies.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
         <t hangText="1.b) Emergency NAI:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            The NAI comes with a realm or username part indicating emergency
            (e.g. 'emergency@emergency.com'). 
            An advantage of this method for NAA cases is that no new requirements are put on the
            involved signaling procedures. Only the identity used for network entry is impacted. 
            Potential disadvantages include that different methods to indicate emergency for NAA
            cases and standard emergency network attachments may be required. Also, modifying the
            NAI itself (the username@realm part) may conflict with network selection and network
            entry procedures, depending on the actual access network.</t>
         </list> 
         </t>
         
         <t>Emergency EAP method<vspace blankLines="1"/>
         An emergency indication can be given by using a dedicated EAP method that is reserved
            for emergency network attachment only.
         <list style="hanging"> 
            <t hangText="2.a) Existing EAP method with New Method Type:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
            An existing EAP method may be used. EAP methods
            themselves typically do not support emergency indication. One option would be to pick a
            common EAP method like EAP-TLS and allocate a new method type for the same method that
            is exclusively reserved to emergency use. Such EAP method should be chosen in a way that
            the same method can support NAA cases as well as standard emergency network attachment.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
         <t hangText="2.b) Existing EAP Method:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Same as 2a), but without assigning a new EAP method type for
            emergency. In this case some implicit indication must be used. For example, in cases
            where EAP-TLS is used in network attachment in combination with client certificates,
            the absence of a client certificate could be interpreted by the network as a request
            for emergency network attachment.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
         <t hangText="2.c) Emergency EAP Method:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
            A new EAP method could be defined that is specifically
            designed for emergency network entry in NAA cases. Most likely, such EAP method would
            not be usable for standard emergency network attachment with an existing subscription.
            Such dedicated emergency EAP method should be key-generating in compliance with RFC3748
            to enable the regular air interface security methods even in unauthenticated operation.</t>

         </section>
         <section title="Securing Network Attachment in NAA Cases">
         <t>For network attachment in NAA cases, it may make sense to secure the link-layer
            connection between the device and the IAP/ISP. This especially holds for wireless access
            with examples being <sm> IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.16 </sm> based access. The latter even mandates secured
            communication across the wireless link for all IAP/ISP networks based on <xref target="nwgstg3"/>.</t>
         <t>Therefore, for network attachment that is by default based on EAP authentication it is
            desirable <sm> [Not mandatory for IEEE 802.11, so perhaps we could remove these next couple of words] or even mandatory </sm>
            also for NAA network attachment to use a key-generating EAP
            method (that provides an MSK key to the authenticator to bootstrap further key
            derivation for protecting the wireless link).</t>

         <t>The following approaches to match the above can be identified:</t>
         <t>
         <list style="hanging">
         <t hangText="1) Server-only Authentication:">
         <vspace blankLines="1"/> The device of the emergency service requester performs
            an EAP method with the IAP/ISP EAP server that performs server authentication only.
            An example for this is EAP-TLS. This provides a certain level of assurance about the
            IAP/ISP to the device user. It requires the device to be provisioned with appropriate
            trusted root certificates to be able to verify the server certificate of the EAP server
            (unless this step is explicitly skipped in the device in case of an emergency service
            request).<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

         <t hangText="2) Null Authentication:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
         <sm>In one case (e.g. WiMAX) </sm>an EAP method is 
            performed. However, no credentials specific to
            either the server or the device or subscription are used as part of the authentication
            exchange. An example for this would be an EAP-TLS exchange with using the TLS_DH_anon
            (anonymous) ciphersuite. Alternatively, a publicly available static key for emergency
            access could be used. In the latter case, the device would need to be provisioned with
            the appropriate emergency key for the IAP/ISP in advance.
            
            <sm> In another case (e.g. IEEE 802.11), no EAP method is used, so that empty frames are 
            transported during the over the air IEEE 802.1X exchange. In this case the
            authentication state machine completes with no cryptographic keys being exchanged.</sm>
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            </t>

         <t hangText="3) Device Authentication:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
            This case extends the server-only authentication case. If the
            device is configured with a device certificate and the IAP/ISP EAP server can rely on a
            trusted root allowing the EAP server to verify the device certificate, at least the
            device identity (e.g., the MAC address) can be authenticated by the IAP/ISP in NAA cases.
            An example for this are WiMAX devices that are shipped with device certificates issued
            under the global WiMAX device public-key infrastructure. To perform unauthenticated
            emergency calls, if allowed by the IAP/ISP, such devices perform EAP-TLS based network
            attachment with client authentication based on the device certificate.</t>

      <section anchor="secconsiderations" title="Security Considerations">
         <t>The security threats discussed in <xref target="RFC5069"/> are applicable to this
            document.</t>
         <t>There are a couple of new vulnerabilities raised with unauthenticated emergency services
            in NASP/NAA cases since the PSAP operator will typically not possess any identity 
			information about the emergency call via the signaling path itself. In countries where
			this functionality is used for GSM networks today this has lead to a significant
			amount of misuse. </t>
         <t>In the context of NAA, the IAP and the ISP will probably want to make sure that the
		    claimed emergency caller
            indeed performs an emergency call rather than using the network for other purposes, and
            thereby acting fraudulent by skipping any authentication, authorization and accounting
            procedures. By restricting access of the unauthenticated emergency caller to the LoST
            server and the PSAP URI, traffic can be restricted only to emergency calls.
            This can be accomplished with traffic separation. The details, however, e.g. for using 
            filtering, depend on the deployed ISP architecture and are beyond the scope of this 
            document.</t>
         <t>We only illustrate a possible
            model. If the ISP runs its own LoST server, it would maintain an access control list
            including all IP addresses contained in responses returned by the LoST server, as
            well as the LoST server itself. (It may need to translate the domain names returned
            to IP addresses and hope that the resolution captures all possible DNS responses.)
            Since the media destination addresses are not predictable, the ISP also has to
            provide a SIP outbound proxy so that it can determine the media addresses and add
            those to the filter list.
         </t>
         <t>For the ZBP case the additional aspect of fraud has to be considered. 
            Unless the emergency call traverses a PSTN gateway or the ASP charges for IP-to-IP
            calls, there is little potential for fraud. If the ASP also operates the LoST server,
            the outbound proxy MAY restrict outbound calls to the SIP URIs returned by the LoST
            server. It is NOT RECOMMENDED to rely on a fixed list of SIP URIs, as that list may
            change. </t>
         <t>Finally, a number of security vulnerabilities discussed in <xref
               target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-arch"/> around faked location information are less
            problematic in the context of unauthenticated emergency since location information
			does not need to be provided by the
            end host itself or it can be verified to fall within a specific geographical area. </t>
