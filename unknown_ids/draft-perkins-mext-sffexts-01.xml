<t>
	A mobile node with multiple radio interfaces running in
	single-radio mode will typically need IP address continuity
	as it migrates from one 4G wireless network to another; Mobile
	IPv6 is very well suited for that purpose.  For such mobile nodes
	using Mobile IP, mobility management by the home agent can be
	extended to provide necessary information about the Signal
	Forwarding Functions (SFFs) that have been defined for WiMAX and
	for eHRPD/CDMA networks.  In this document, we explain the
	operations required to support single-radio mobile nodes and
	specify new extensions to Mobile IPv6 Binding Update and
	Binding Acknowledgement for supporting ease of access between
	mobile nodes and SFFs.

<section anchor='intro' title='Introduction'>

<t>
	There is growing interest to enable efficient handovers between
	heterogeneous radio access technologies (RATs) for networks owned
	by the same network operator, or network operators who have entered
	into roaming agreements.  Since authentication is indispensible
	for enabling the attachment of a mobile node, a mutually accessible
	authentication authority is indispensible for enabling efficient
	handovers between such operator networks.  Based on this authentication
	authority, we can develop trust relationships between agents in each
	network that are charged with responsibilities for aiding handovers.
</t>

<t>

	Wireless devices that are designed to attach to networks using
	heterogeneous RATs must include radio interfaces enabling connectivity
	to each desired RAT.  But each radio interface requires substantial
	power -- in fact, the radio interfaces for mobile wireless devices
	are quite often the biggest consumer of scarce battery power.  For
	this reason, today, and into the foreseeable future, most mobile
	wireless devices that have multiple radio interfaces will nevertheless
	only keep one of them powered on at any particular time.  Such devices
	are known as "single-radio" mobile nodes (MNs), notwithstanding the
	presence of multiple radio interfaces in each MN's hardware.
</t>

<t>

	Single-radio nodes present design challenges, because if only
	a single radio interface is powered on at any particular time,
	it is not possible for the device to be simultaneously connected
	to two different networks.  In such cases, handover protocols must
	try to compensate for the time during which the wireless device
	will be retuning its hardware to establish a link with the target
	network.  This "break-before-make" mode of operation is susceptible
	to dropping packets during the time when the target radio access
	link is not yet established, but the link to the source network has
	already been released.
</t>

<t>

	For smooth handovers, it is imperative to reduce the time between
	release of one radio link and establishment of the new radio link
	at the target network.  Before the new link can be established in
	the target network, some or all of the following procedures must
	typically be followed:

<list style="hanging">

<t>
	- Scheduling the radio link
</t>

<t>
	- Authenticating the mobile node
</t>

<t>
	- Creating proper context for the mobile node
</t>

<t>
	- Allocating data paths for traffic to/from the mobile node
</t>
</list>

</t>

<t>
	The specific details for each step vary quite a bit depending
	on the particular RAT used in the target network.  But, regardless
	of the particular target RAT, completing the listed procedures
	is too time consuming to enable smooth handovers when faced
	with the "break-before-make" nature of a single-radio MN.  For
	this reason, it is very important that the MN try to accomplish
	as many of the attachment procedures as possible before releasing
	its current radio link.  So, for instance, while MN is still
	attached to network N1, it may try to transfer context to a target
	base station in a target network N2.  In fact, almost all of the
	above procedures can be accomplished ahead of the actual radio
	link break, with operator agreement and mutual access to core
	network functions.   For ease of discussion, in this document
	all such handover optimizations will collectively be termed as
	"pre-registration".
</t>

<t>

	There has been considerable effort invested into protocol support 
	for preregistration.  To do the signaling from the current network
	into the target network, the mobile node needs the following
	information about the target network:
<list style="hanging">

<t>
	- Scheduling the radio link
</t>

<t>
	- location of basestation or access point
</t>

<t>
	- IP addresses of signaling endpoints for preregistration
	  functional modules
</t>

<t>
	- Security association parameters for those signaling endpoints
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
	The latter requirement results from the possibility that
	preregistration signaling between the MN's current network and
	the target network may traverse the Internet, even though the
	networks are owned by the same operators or operators who
	have made roaming agreements.  It may be impracticable for
	such information to be preconfigured into each of the millions
	of subscriber devices roaming around today's wireless networks,
	and the number of devices continues to increase rapidly from
	year to year.  Given that, any preconfiguration strategy is
	likely to fail soon.
</t>

<t>
	Therefore, the MN must not only follow the require preregistration
	procedures for the target network, but it must also discover
	the necessary IP addresses for the target functional modules, and
	it must also establish a security relationship with each such
	target module.  The discovery mechanisms for these handover agents
	typically involve DHCP or resolution of purpose-built DNS name.
	The former approach could be integrated with other DHCP access
	procedures; using DNS affords a speed advantage to the latter
	approach.  One can reasonably ask how the MN might get access
	to the proper DHCP server or DNS server, especially given the
	emphasis on private addressing in today's networks.  Many
	restrictions and assumptions are required in order for the
	necessary information to be supplied to the MN.
</t>

<t>
	These discovery and security procedures are to be undertaken
	after the MN determines that it would be beneficial to move to
	a new network.  The benefit is typically for improved coverage,
	but in many cases also results from reduced cost or improved
	security or access to needed resources unavailable in the current
	network.  For whatever reason, after the determination is made,
	the MN cannot yet start to carry out its preregistration tasks.
	The discovery and security tasks cannot be started until the
	target network can be identified, and the target network is
	closely associated with the current location of the MN.
</t>

<t>
	In summary, once the MN starts to move to a new network, the
	following are required:

<list style="hanging">
<t>
	- Discovery of handover agent(s) in the target network
</t>

<t>
	- Security establishment with target agents
</t>

<t>
	- Pre-authentication using the security services trusted by
	  the foreign network
</t>

<t>
	- Possibly other pre-registration tasks.
</t>
</list>

</t>

<t>
	Each of these procedures may require lengthy signaling
	transactions with the MN.  It is the goal of this document
	to specify a way to reduce the time delay associated with the
	first two tasks.  By doing so, it is expected that handover
	performance can be substantially improved.  Moreover, given
	reasonable assumptions about operator roaming agreements, it
	is likely that this proposal will be simpler to deploy and
	simpler for ongoing network management.

	Recent documents describing handovers between cooperating networks
	supporting different radio technologies have specified a new
	functional module called a Signal Forwarding Function (SFF).
	The SFF is the agent in the target network which assists the
	MN to carry out preregistration tasks while the MN still has
	radio access in its current network.  The details of the signaling
	between the MN and the SFF fundamentally depend on the requirements
	of the target network; it is out of scope for this document to
	specify any preregistration protocol exchange that the SFF would
	handle in the target network on behalf of the MN.  See Figure 1.

<t hangText='   Figure 1: MN at current PoA signaling via SFF in target network'>
<vspace blankLines='1' />
	Here, Network A is the current point of attachment for the MN,
	and Network B is the target network.  MN signals to SFF in
	Network B to prepare for the handover from Network A into
	Network B.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>	
	The SFF in the target network relays the MN signals to the
	network elements in the Radio Access Network (RAN) which will
	offer radio access to the MN.
</t>

<t>	
	SFF behavior has been specified in detail for eHRPD/CDMA networks
	as well as for WiMAX networks.  For a variety of reasons, seemingly
	not all technical, 3GPP has chosen to recommend instead a more
	integrated approach for interworking between LTE networks and other
	target networks.  Notably, LTE handovers are specified under the
	assumption that the MN's address belongs to the LTE operator.
	WiMAX and HRPD network technologies are more friendly to assisting
	MN's that are addressable from via domains supporting other
	RATs.
</t>

<t>	
	Signaling between single-radio MNs and the SFF in a target network
	may follow protocol under development in the 802.21(c) task group
	under the auspices of IEEE 802.  This document can be viewed as
	a companion document to the SFF-based handover assistance being
	defined within 802.21(c).
</t>

<t>	
	As the MN moves from one network to another, the SFF that was
	the target SFF becomes the SFF in the MN's current network.
	We observe that for operators offering SFF modules for handovers
	between heterogeneous network types, the SFF in the MN's current
	network (which can be called the "originating network") can
	manage security associations with SFFs in neighboring
	networks belonging to roaming partners.  Such security associations
	facilitate a simplified approach for the necessary discovery and
	security establishment between a MN and a target SFF, as follows.
</t>

<t>	
	When the MN completes its handover to a target network, it will
	have a security association with the SFF in that target network.
	If the MN maintains this security association, then it can make
	use of the SFF in that network to assist in discovery and
	secure communication with a future SFF in a future target network.
	The abbreviation TSFF will be used for the target SFF, and the
	SFF in the MN's current network will be called the "Originating SFF",
	abbreviated OSFF.  With that terminology, the handover between
	the originating network and the target network can be made faster
	using the services of the OSFF and the TSFF.  See Figure 2.

<vspace blankLines='1' />
	Again, Network A is the current point of attachment for the MN,
	and Network B is the target network.  MN initially relays signals
	to TSFF (in Network B) by way of OSFF (in Network A) to prepare
	for the handover from Network A into Network B.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>	
	Specifically, when the MN has determined that a handover
	is beneficial, the following services should be offered by the OSFF:
<list style='hanging'>
<t>
	- The OSFF should be able to identify the proper TSFF to
	  help the MN with handover to the target network.
</t>
<t>
	- The OSFF should be able to provide a shared key to establish
	  a security association between the MN and the TSFF.
</t>
</list>
	In other words, the OSFF enables optimized discovery and
	security establishment for the TSFF and thus substantially
	simplifies and shortens the handover preparation time
	needed by the MN.  When the MN arrives at the target network,
	the TSFF becomes the OSFF and the MN has a security
	association with the OSFF useful for future handover
	services.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="Colocate"
	title="Co-locating SFF in the home network with the Home Agent">

<t>
	The foregoing overview does not explain how a MN might best
	get information about the SFF in the network providing the MN's
	initial point of attachment (PoA).
</t>

<t>
	Up until this point in the current document, there has been no attention
	paid for the need of the MN to maintain IP address continuity as it
	moves from the originating network to a target network.  For this
	purpose, the MN can use Mobile IPv6<xref target="RFC3775" />
	(or Mobile IP for IPv4 devices<xref target="RFC3344" />).  The
	Binding Update (BU) from the MN is, more often than not, transmitted
	as soon as the MN has established a radio link at the target
	network; alternatively, the BU could be sent just as the radio
	link between the MN and the originating network were to be
	broken.  This latter approach as the advantage of reducing
	the amount of time during which the home agent would be routing
	packets to the wrong network, but would not work as well if the
	target network required a long time to establish a new radio
	link.
</t>

<t>
	When the mobile node (MN) is making its initial point of
	attachment, it does not yet need the services of any SFF.  
	The MN could get the required address of the SFF and establish
	a security association at any time after its initial attachment
	procedures have completed.  In this document, it is proposed
	that this information be delivered by the home agent as part
	of the Mobile IPv6 registration procedure.  Furthermore, it is
	proposed that the SFF function in the home domain should be
	co-located with the home agent in that domain.  Doing so has
	several advantages, as follows:

<list style='hanging'>
<t>
	- The home agent is a natural repository for mobility management
	  functions such as SFF.  If the home agent is co-located with
	  the SFF in the MN's home domain, it can readily assist the MN
	  with handovers from any visited network back to the home
	  network.  This is expected to be a very frequent case.
</t>
<t>

	- The MN naturally already has a security association with
	  the home agent.  When the home agent is co-located with
	  home SFF (i.e., HSFF), then the all of the necessary procedures
	  for finding and securing communications with SFFs in all visited
	  networks of roaming partners can be accomplished without any
	  additional need for DHCP or IKEv2.
</t>
<t>

	- The MN is already required to securely transmit a BU to
	  its home agent.  Adding a new extension to the BU, requesting
	  the IP address and shared key for the local SFF is economical
	  and introduces fewer error conditions.
</t>
<t>

	- In the typical case where the MN begins its initial network
	  attachment in its home network, the MN can rely on its home
	  agent as an OSFF for future handovers to target networks.
</t>
<t>
	- For handovers from WiFi into any network of roaming partner,
	  the MN can utilize its home agent/HSFF as an OSFF to establish
	  preregistration signaling with any desired target network
	  enabled for roaming.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
	Given the appropriate security model between roaming partners,
	co-locating the SFF function with the home agent in the home
	network enables also reduces the number of mobility agents
	requiring configuration and management.
</t>

<t>
	In this document, only signaling elements for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)
	are specified.  Similar extensions to Registration Request and
	Registration Reply for Mobile IPv4 can readily be specified.
</t>

<t>
	The following extension to the Binding Update of MIPv6 is needed
	so that the MN can request information about the SFF in the
	network providing its care-of address
<list style='hanging'>
<t>
	- SFF address Request (SFF-REQ)
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
	The following extension to the Binding Acknowledgement is needed
	so that the HA can request information about the SFF to the
	requesting MN
<list style='hanging'>
<t>
	- SFF address Reply (SFF-REP)
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
	The SFF in the MN's current network (i.e., OSFF) will be
	tasked with enabling security associations between the MN
	and a future target SFF.  Therefore the MN will require a
	security association with OSFF, and there does not appear
	to be a need for providing an "SFF address Request" extension
	that does not also imply a simulataneous request for key
	material to establish the security association with OSFF.
</t>

<t>
	The Home Agent MAY supply an SFF-REP extension to the MN in
	its BAck even when the MN has not requested it, if the
	MN is known by preconfiguration or other means to support
	the ability to utilize OSFF for handover assistance.
</t>

<t>
	It is presumed in this initial version of the SFF-REQ and
	SFF-REP specification that the MN's care-of address is
	sufficient for the home agent to determine the proper
	and roaming network to which the OSFF belongs, and thus
	be able to determine the IP address for the OSFF.  Future
	versions of this specification may specify additional
	location information to be included with the Binding Update.

	The SFF SPI (32 bits) is used by the MN as needed for any

<t>
	The home agent first picks a random number to be used
	for K_sff, the desired shared key between MN and SFF. 
	Then, the home agent computes the Encrypted Key as follows,
	using the parameters it supplies in the SFF-REP:

<list style='hanging'>
<t>
	Encrypted SFF key = [K_sff (+) HMAC_SHA1 (SFFaddr, SFF_SPI)]
</t>

<t>
	Encrypted SFF key hides K_sff for transmission to the MN
</t>
<t>

</t>
<t>
	HMAC_SHA1<xref target="RFC2401" /> is the algorithm
	to be used by the Home Agent to encrypt the K_sff for delivery

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>
	This document uses techniques from RFC 2104 (and RFC 3957) for key
	distribution.  Up until now, no security weaknesses have been reported
	for those techniques, as long as the basic encryption algorithms are
	themselves secure.  HMAC_SHA1 is recommended for encryption.
</t>
<t>
	In future revisions of this specification, SHA-256 or AES
	may be instead specified, since SHA-1 has been shown to
	have some potential vulnerabilities.  However, for low volume
	(comtrol plane) signaling, such vulnerabilities are unlikely
	to have any significant effect.
</t>
<t>
	This specification should be considered as an initial
	draft.  The exact nature of the algorithm used to compute the
	Encrypted Key field of the SFF-REP is subject to discussion
	and changes are likely.
</t>
<t>
	The home SFF (HSFF) colocated with home agent is also charged
	with the responsibility for supplying K_sff to the SFF in the
	network supporting the mobile node's Care-of Address (i.e., OSFF).
	Messages currently undergoing specification within IEEE 802.21(c)
	and 802.21(a) are likely to be used between HSFF and OSFF.
	The nature of the algorithm used to provide confidentiality for
	the IEEE 802.21(c) messages between HSFF and OSFF may well be
	different than the algorithm used for SFF-REP computation.
