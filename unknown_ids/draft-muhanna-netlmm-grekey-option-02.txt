Abstract

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 base specification defined in [PMIP6-ID] allows
   the mobile node's IPv4 and IPv6 traffic between the local mobility
   anchor and the mobile access gateway to be tunneled using IPv6, IPv4
   or IPv4-UDP encapsulation headers.  These encapsulation modes do not
   offer semantics for the tunnel end-points to expose a service

   identifier that can be used to identify traffic for a certain
   classification, such as for supporting mobile nodes that are using
   overlapping private IPv4 addressing.  The extensions defined in this
   document allow the mobile access gateway and the local mobility
   anchor to negotiate GRE encapsulation mode and along with the GRE
   symmetric key or asymmetric keys for marking the flows, so that
   differential processing can be applied by the tunnel peers over those
   flows.

Internet-Draft    GRE Key Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6        April 2008


1.  Introduction

   The base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification allows the use of IPv6, IPv4
   or IPv4-UDP encapsulation modes for the tunneled traffic between the
   local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway.  There are
   scenarios where these encapsulation modes are not sufficient and
   there is a need for an encapsulation mode with richer semantics.  The
   Generic Routing Encapsulation [RFC-2784] and coupled with the Key and
   Sequence Number extension [RFC-2890], has the required semantics for
   use in Proxy Mobile IPv6.

   This document defines extensions to the base Proxy Mobile IPv6
   specification, for allowing the mobile access gateway and the local
   mobility anchor to negotiate GRE encapsulation mode and for
   exchanging the GRE symmetric or asymmetric key(s) that can be used
   for marking the forward and reverse traffics.

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

   All the general mobility related terminology and abbreviations are to
   be interpreted as defined in Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC-3775] and
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [PMIP6-SPEC].

   Forward Direction Traffic

      The traffic in the tunnel between the local mobility anchor and
      the mobile access gateway, heading towards the mobile access
      gateway and tunneled at the local mobility anchor.

   Reverse Direction Traffic

      The traffic in the tunnel between the mobile access gateway and
      the local mobility anchor, heading towards the local mobility
      anchor and tunneled at the mobile access gateway.



3.  Protocol Overview

   Using the extension defined in this specification, the mobile access
   gateway and the local mobility anchor can negotiate GRE encapsulation
   mode along with the GRE keys for marking the forward and reverse

   traffics.

   Once the GRE keys have been negotiated between the mobile access
   gateway and the local mobility anchor, the mobile access gateway will
   use the reverse direction GRE key that is assigned by the local
   mobility anchor in the GRE encapsulation header of the reverse
   direction payload packet.  Similarly, the local mobility anchor will
   use the forward GRE key as negotiated with the mobile access gateway
   in the GRE encapsulation header of the forward direction payload
   packet.

   The following illustration explains the use of GRE encapsulation mode
   and the use of GRE keys for supporting the scenario where overlapping
   IPv4 private address allocation is in use.

   Figure-1 illustrates a local mobility anchor providing mobility
   service to mobile nodes that are from different operators and are
   assigned IPv4 addresses from overlapping private address space.  In
   this scenario, the mobile access gateway and the local mobility
   anchor must be able distinguish the flows belonging to a given
   operator from the flows belonging to some other operator.

   The mobile nodes, MN-1 and MN-2 are visiting from Operator-A, and
   mobile nodes, MN-3 and MN-4 are visiting from Operator-B.  The mobile
   access gateway and the local mobility anchor agree upon a key(s) for
   identifying the flows belonging to each mobile node.

   The local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway will be able
   to distinguish these flows based on the key present in the GRE header
   of the tunneled packet, and can route them accordingly.



4.  Local Mobility Anchor Considerations

4.1.  GRE Tunneling and Encapsulation Procedures

   As per the base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification, the tunnel transport
   between the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor can
   be IPv6, IPv4 or IPv4-UDP.  When GRE tunneling is negotiated as per
   this specification, the semantics related to the tunnel transport is
   not impacted, but an additional GRE header is added above the payload
   packet as indicated below.

                        Figure 2: GRE Encapsulation



4.2.  Operational Summary

   o  Upon receiving a Proxy Binding Update message with the GRE Key
      Identifier Option, the local mobility anchor, if it does not
      support GRE encapsulation mode, MUST send the Proxy Binding
      Acknowledgement message to the mobile access gateway with the
      status code 148, (GRE Encapsulation not supported).

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Update message does not contain the
      GRE Key Identifier Option, and if the local mobility anchor
      determines that overlapping IPv4 private addressing is in use, the
      local mobility anchor MUST reject the request, and MUST send the
      Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message to the mobile access gateway
      with the status code 149, indicating that GRE encapsulation is
      required.

   o  Upon receiving a Proxy Binding Update message with the GRE Key
      Identifier Option, the local mobility anchor, if it determines
      that overlapping private IPv4 addressing is not in use, MUST send
      the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message to the mobile access
      gateway with the status code success without including the GRE Key
      Identifier option.

   o  If the GRE tunneling is negotiated between the local mobility
      anchor and the mobile access gateway, every packet that is
      originating from the mobile node's home gateway, MUST be
      encapsulated with a GRE header, and MUST use the negotiated
      forward direction GRE key and with the chosen transport header
      such as IPv4, IPv4-UDP or IPv6, just as per the base Proxy Mobile
      IPv6 specification.

   o  On receiving a packet from the tunnel with the GRE encapsulation
      header, the local mobility anchor MUST use the GRE Key present in
      the GRE extension header to lookup the mobile node's home gateway
      address for forwarding the packet after removing the encapsulation
      headers.



5.  Mobility Access Gateway Considerations

   For requesting the GRE Tunneling support, the mobile access gateway
   MUST include the GRE Key Identifier Option in the Proxy Binding
   Update message sent to the local mobility anchor.  In case the mobile

   access gateway local policy requires the MAG to generate the forward
   direction GRE key, the MAG must include the forward key in the GRE
   key Identifier Option.  Optionally, the MAG may set the GRE key
   Identifier field in the GRE key Identifier Option to zero to indicate
   that the MAG will accept either symmetric or asymmetric GRE keys as
   specified by the LMA.  In the case the MAG requires the LMA to
   specify two asymmetric keys, the MAG will set the GRE Key Identifier
   field in the GRE Key Identifier option to all-ones.  In the case of
   symmetric keys, the LMA must return one single key in the GRE Key
   Identifier option.  However, in the case of asymmetric GRE keys, the
   LMA must send two GRE keys in the GRE Key Identifier option, with the
   first key being the forward direction key and the second is the
   reverse direction key.  In the latter case, the GRE Key Identifier
   option length MUST be set to 10.

5.1.  Extensions to the Conceptual Data Structure

   Every mobile access gateway maintains a Binding Update List for each
   currently attached mobile node, as explained in Section 6.2 of the
   base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [PMIP6-SPEC].  The Binding
   Update List is a conceptual data structure, described in Section 11.1
   of the Mobile IPv6 base specification [RFC-3775].  For supporting
   this specification, the conceptual Binding Update List data structure
   must be extended with the following two new additional fields related
   to bi-directional GRE Key identifiers used for tagging the mobile
   node's tunneled traffic.

   o  A flag indicating whether GRE encapsulation is enabled for the
      mobile node's traffic flows.

   o  The Reverse GRE Key Identifier used in the GRE encapsulation
      header of the tunneled packet from the mobile access gateway to
      the local mobility anchor and that is originating from the mobile
      node.  This GRE Key identifier is obtained from the GRE Key
      Identifier Option present in the received Proxy Binding
      Acknowledgement message sent by the local mobility anchor as
      specified in this document.

   o  The Forward GRE Key Identifier used in the GRE encapsulation
      header of the tunneled packet from the local mobility anchor to
      the mobile access gateway and that is destined to the mobile node.
      This GRE Key identifier may be a locally configured key or as
      specified by the LMA as per this specification.  This key
      identifier may be the same as the reverse direction key used for
      the outgoing flows from the mobile access gateway to the local
      mobility anchor.

Internet-Draft    GRE Key Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6        April 2008


5.2.  Operational Summary

   o  If IPv4 Home Address support is enabled for the mobile node and if
      the IPv4 Home Address Option is included in the Proxy Binding
      Update message that is sent by the mobile access gateway to the
      mobile node's local mobility anchor, the GRE Key Identifier Option
      SHOULD be included in the Proxy Binding Update message.  If the
      MAG includes the forward key in the GRE Key Identifier Option, the
      local mobility anchor must use this key to identify the mobile
      node's traffic encapsulated in a GRE header as specified in the
      GRE specification [RFC-2784] and using the GRE Key and Sequence
      Number extension [RFC-2890] with the assigned GRE key.

   o  After receiving a Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message with the
      status code indicating the acceptance of the Proxy Binding Update
      message and with the GRE Key Identifier Option, the mobile access
      gateway MUST use GRE encapsulation and the assigned Reverse GRE
      Key for tunneling all the traffic originating from the mobile
      node.

   o  For a given mobile nodes, if the local mobility anchor rejects the
      Proxy Binding Update by sending the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
      with the status code 148 (GRE Encapsulation not supported), the
      mobile access gateway MUST NOT include the GRE Key Identifier
      Option in the subsequent Proxy Binding Update messages that are
      sent to that Local Mobility Anchor.

   o  If the mobile access gateway has sent a Proxy Binding Update
      message with out the GRE Key Identifier Option, but the received
      Proxy Binding Acknowledgement has the Status Code 149, indicating
      that the GRE encapsulation is required, the mobile access gateway
      SHOULD resend the Proxy Binding Update message with the GRE Key
      Identifier Option.

   o  If the mobile access gateway has sent a Proxy Binding Update
      message with the GRE Key Identifier Option, but the received Proxy
      Binding Acknowledgement has the Status Code success without the
      GRE Key Identifier option, indicating that the GRE encapsulation
      is not required for this mobile node, the mobile access gateway
      must not use GRE encapsulation for this Mobile node.

   o  If the GRE tunneling is negotiated between the local mobility
      anchor and the mobile access gateway, every packet originating
      from the mobile node MUST be encapsulated with a GRE header using
      the Reverse GRE key and the chosen transport header such as IPv4,
      IPv4-UDP or IPv6, just as per the base Proxy Mobile IPv6
      specification.

Internet-Draft    GRE Key Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6        April 2008


   o  One receiving a packet from the tunnel with the GRE encapsulation
      header, the mobile access gateway MUST use the GRE Key to lookup
      the mobile node's layer-2 address and use it for forwarding the
      packet after removing the encapsulation headers.



6.  Message Formats

   This section defines extensions to the Mobile IPv6 [RFC-3775]
   protocol messages for supporting this specification.

6.1.  GRE Key Identifier Option

   A new option, the GRE Key Identifier Option, is defined for use in
   the Proxy Binding Update and Acknowledgment messages exchanged
   between the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor.
   This option can be used for exchanging the GRE key to be applied by

       Length

           Eight-bit unsigned integer indicating the length in octets of
           the option, excluding the type and length fields.  This is
           set to a value of 6 or 10.

       Reserved

           This field is reserved for future use. The value MUST be
           initialized to 0 by the sender and MUST be ignored by the
           receiver.

       GRE Key Identifier
           four-byte field  containing the Reverse GRE Key Identifier.
           or eight-byte containing the Forward and Reverse GRE keys
           respectively. The values of zero and all-ones are reserved.

6.2.  Status Codes

   Proxy Binding Acknowledgment Status Values

   The following status code values are defined for using them in the
   Binding Acknowledgment message when using Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol.
   The value allocation for this usage needs to be approved by the IANA
   and must be updated in the IANA registry.

   148: GRE Encapsulation not required.

   149: GRE Encapsulation is required.  GRE Key Identifier option

   required.

   Status values less than 128 indicate that the Binding Update was
   processed successfully by the receiving nodes.  Values greater than
   128 indicate that the Binding Update was rejected by the Home Agent.




7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new Option, the GRE Key Option, described in
   Section 3.  This option is carried in the Mobility Header.  The type
   value for this option needs to be assigned from the same numbering
   space as allocated for the other mobility options defined in the
   Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC-3775].



8.  Security Considerations

   The GRE Key Option, defined in this document, that can be carried in
   Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages,
   reveals the group affiliation of a mobile node identified by its NAI
   or an IP address.  It may help an attacker in targeting flows
   belonging to a specific group.  This vulnerability can be prevented,
   by enabling confidentiality protection on the Proxy Binding Update
   and Acknowledgement messages where the presence of the NAI and GRE
   Key Options establish a mobile node's relation to a specific group.
   This vulnerability can also be avoided by enabling confidentiality
   protection on all the tunneled data packets between the mobile access
   gateway and the local mobility anchor, for hiding all the markings.



9.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Allesio Casati, Barney Barownsky,
   Mark Grayson and Parviz Yegnani for their input on the need for this
   option.  The authors would like to thank Curtis Provost for his
   detailed review and comments.
