1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Dual-Stack Lite [I-D.softwire-ds-lite] is a solution to offer both
   IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity to customers which are addressed only with
   an IPv6 prefix (no IPv4 address is assigned to the attachment
   device).  One of its key components is an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel,
   commonly referred to as a Softwire.  DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand
   (B4) will not know if the network it is attached to offers Dual-Stack
   Lite support, and if it did would not know the remote end of the
   tunnel to establish a connection.

   To inform the B4 of the Address Family Transition Router's (AFTR)
   location, an option containing a single IPv6 address may be used.
   Once this information is conveyed, the presence of the configuration
   indicating the AFTR's location also informs a host to initiate Dual-
   Stack Lite (DS-Lite) service and become a Softwire Initiator.

   To provide the conveyance of the configuration information, a single
   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] option is used.

   The details of how the B4 establishes an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel to the
   AFTR are out of scope for this document.


3.  The Dual-Stack Lite Address DHCPv6 Option

   The Dual-Stack Lite Address option consists of option-code and
   option-len fields (common for all DHCPv6 options), and a 128 bit
   tunnel-endpoint-addr field, containing one IPv6 address.  The tunnel-
   endpoint-addr specifies the location of the remote tunnel endpoint,
   expected to be located at an AFTR.

   The DS-Lite Address option MAY appear in the root scope of a DHCPv6
   packet.  It MUST NOT appear inside any IA_NA, IA_TA, IA_PD, IAADDR,
   or similar.  Any DS-Lite Address option received inside any other
   option MUST be ignored.

   The DS-Lite Address option MUST NOT appear more than once in a
   message.

   The format of the Dual-Stack Lite Address option is shown in the

       +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                option-code: OPTION_DS_LITE_ADDR (TBD)

                 option-len: Length of the tunnel-endpoint-addr field,
                             which is precisely 16 octets.

       tunnel-endpoint-addr: A single IPv6 address in binary
                             representation of the remote tunnel
                             endpoint, located at the DS-Lite AFTR.

            Figure 1: DS-Lite IPv6 Address DHCPv6 Option Format

   The client validates the DS-Lite Address option by confirming the
   option length is exactly 16 octets.  The client MUST ignore any DS-
   Lite Address option that has length other than 16 octets.

   Because this option conveys the tunnel-endpoint-addr value, no
   further processing is required of the client.

   This option conveys a single IPv6 address, as the Dual-Stack Lite
   specification [I-D.softwire-ds-lite] defines only one Softwire
   connection between a B4 and any AFTR.  Multiple connections or
   endpoints are undefined.  It is expected that Service Provider (SP)
   will deal with load balancing and high availability, not the client.
   For more information, see Section 12.3 "High Availability" of
   [I-D.softwire-ds-lite].


4.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   Following requirements are result of applying behaviors defined in
   RFC 3315 Section 17.2.2 [RFC3315] to the DS-Lite Address option.
   They do not change default DHCPv6 operation, but rather are
   enumerated here as a convenience for the reader.

   If configured to offer DS-Lite Address information, DHCPv6 server

Internet-Draft            DS-Lite DHCPv6 Option           September 2010


   will include the DS-Lite Address option if such option appears on the
   client's Option Request Option (OPTION_ORO).  RFC 3315 Section 17.2.2
   [RFC3315] describes how a DHCPv6 client and server negotiate
   configuration values using the ORO.

   A DHCPv6 server MUST NOT send DS-Lite Address option if it has not
   been explicitly requested by the client.

   A DHCPv6 server MUST NOT send more than one DS-Lite Address option.

   A DHCPv6 server MUST NOT send DS-Lite Address as suboption in other
   options.


5.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   A client that supports B4 functionality of DS-Lite (defined in
   [I-D.softwire-ds-lite]) and conforms to this specification MUST
   include OPTION_DS_LITE_ADDR on its OPTION_ORO.

   If the client receives DS-Lite Address option, it MUST verify the
   option contents as described in Section 3.  The client (B4) is
   expected to establish a softwire tunnel to the tunnel-endpoint-addr
   IPv6 address it determines from DS-Lite Address option.

   Client that receives more than one DS-Lite Address option MUST
   discard all instances of that option.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not present any new security issues, but as with
   all DHCPv6-derived configuration state, it is completely possible
   that the configuration is being delivered by a third party (Man In
   The Middle).  As such, there is no basis to trust that the access the
   DS-Lite Softwire connection represents can be trusted, and it should
   not therefore bypass any security mechanisms such as IP firewalls.

   RFC 3315 [RFC3315] discusses DHCPv6-related security issues.

   [I-D.softwire-ds-lite] discusses DS-Lite related security issues.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate single DHCPv6 option code referencing
   this document, delineating OPTION_DS_LITE_ADDR name.
