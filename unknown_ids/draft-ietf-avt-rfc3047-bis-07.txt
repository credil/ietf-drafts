1.  Introduction

   ITU-T G.722.1 [ITU.G7221] is a low complexity coder, it compresses 50
   Hz - 14 kHz audio signals into one of the following bit rates, 24
   kbit/s, 32 kbit/s or 48 kbit/s.

   The coder may be used for speech, music and other types of audio.

   Some of the applications for which this coder is suitable are:

   o  Real-time communications such as videoconferencing and telephony.

   o  Streaming audio

   o  Archival and messaging

   ITU-T G.722.1 [ITU.G7221] uses 20 ms frames and a sampling rate clock
   of 16 kHz or 32kHz.  The encoding and decoding algorithm can change
   the bit rate at any 20ms frame boundary, but no bit rate change
   notification is provided in-band with the bit stream.

   For any given bit rate the number of bits in a frame is a constant.
   Within this fixed frame, G.722.1 uses variable length coding (e.g.
   Huffman coding) to represent most of the encoded parameters.  All
   variable length codes are transmitted in order from the left most
   (most significant - MSB) bit to the right most (least significant -
   LSB) bit, see [ITU.G7221] for more details.

   The ITU-T standardized bit rates for G.722.1 are 24 kbit/s or
   32kbit/s at 16 Khz sample rate, and 24 kbit/s, 32 kbit/s or 48 kbit/s
   at 32 Khz sample rate.  However, the coding algorithm itself has the
   capability to run at any user specified bit rate (not just 24, 32 and
   48 kbit/s) while maintaining an audio bandwidth of 50 Hz to 14 kHz.
   This rate change is accomplished by a linear scaling of the codec
   operation, resulting in frames with size in bits equal to 1/50 of the
   corresponding bit rate.

3.  RTP usage for G.722.1

3.1.  RTP G.722.1 Header Fields

   The RTP header is defined in the RTP specification [RFC3550].  This
   section defines how fields in the RTP header are used.

      Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this
      packet format is outside the scope of this document; it is
      specified by the RTP profile under which this payload format is
      used, or signaled dynamically out-of-band (e.g., using SDP).

      Marker (M) bit: The M bit is set to zero.

      Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used.

      Timestamp: A 32-bit word that corresponds to the sampling instant
      for the first frame in the RTP packet.  The sampling frequency can
      be 16 Khz or 32 Khz. The RTP timestamp clock frequency of 32 Khz
      SHOULD be used unless only an RTP stream sampled at 16 Khz is
      going to be sent.

3.2.  RTP payload format for G.722.1

   The RTP payload for G.722.1 has the format shown in Figure 1.  No
   additional header fields specific to this payload format are
   required.

   Because bit rate is not signaled in-band, a separate out-of-band
   method is REQUIRED to indicate the bit rate (see section 5 for an
   example of signaling bit rate information using SDP).  For the
   payload format specified here, the bit rate MUST remain constant for
   a particular payload type value.  An application MAY switch bit rates
   and clock rates from packet to packet by defining different payload
   type value and switching between them.

   The use of Huffman coding means that it is not possible to identify
   the various encoded parameters/fields contained within the bit stream
   without first completely decoding the entire frame.  For the purposes
   of packetizing the bit stream in RTP, it is only necessary to
   consider the sequence of bits as output by the G.722.1 encoder, and
   present the same sequence to the decoder.  The payload format
   described here maintains this sequence.

   When operating at 24 kbit/s, 480 bits (60 octets) are produced per
   frame.  When operating at 32 kbit/s, 640 bits (80 octets) are
   produced per frame.  When operating at 48 kbit/s, 960 bits (120
   octets) are produced per frame.  Thus, all three bit rates allow for
   octet alignment without the need for padding bits.

   Figure 2 illustrates how the G.722.1 bit stream MUST be mapped into
   an octet aligned RTP payload.

           Figure 2:  The G.722.1 encoder bit stream is split into
                      a sequence of octets (60, 80 or 120 depending on
                      the bit rate), and each octet is in turn
                      mapped into an RTP octet.

   When operating at non-standard rates the payload format MUST follow
   the guidelines illustrated in Figure 2.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   values in the range 16000 to 48000 be used.  Non standard rates MUST
   have a value that is a multiple of 400 (this maintains octet

   alignment and does not then require (undefined) padding bits for each
   frame if not octet aligned).  For example, a bit rate of 16.4 kbit/s
   will result in a frame of size 328 bits or 41 octets which are mapped
   into RTP per Figure 2.

3.3.  Multiple G.722.1 frames in a RTP packet

   A sender may include more than one consecutive G.722.1 frame in a
   single RTP packet.

   Senders have the following additional restrictions:

   o  Sender SHOULD NOT include more G.722.1 frames in a single RTP
      packet than will fit in the MTU of the RTP transport protocol.

   o  All frames contained in a single RTP packet MUST be of the same
      length and sampled at the same clock rate.  They MUST have the
      same bit rate (octets per frame).

   o  Frames MUST NOT be split between RTP packets.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the number of frames contained within an RTP
   packet be consistent with the application.  For example, in a
   telephony application where delay is important, then the fewer frames
   per packet the lower the delay, whereas for a delay insensitive
   streaming or messaging application, many frames per packet would be
   acceptable.

3.4.  Computing the number of G.722.1 frames

   Information describing the number of frames contained in an RTP
   packet is not transmitted as part of the RTP payload.  The only way
   to determine the number of G.722.1 frames is to count the total
   number of octets within the RTP packet, and divide the octet count by
   the number of expected octets per frame.  This expected octet per
   frame count is derived from the bit rate, and is therefore a function
   of the payload type.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the G7221 media type described in RFC3047.

4.1.  Media Type Registration

   This section describes the media types and names associated with this
   payload format.  The section registers the media types, as per
   RFC4288 [RFC4288]

4.1.1.  Registration of media type audio/G7221

   Media type name: audio

   Media subtype name: G7221

   Required parameters:

      bitrate: the data rate for the audio bit stream.  This parameter
      is mandatory because the bit rate is not signaled within the
      G.722.1 bit stream.  At the standard G.722.1 bit rates, the value
      MUST be either 24000 or 32000 at 16 Khz sample rate, and 24000,
      32000 or 48000 at 32 Khz sample rate.  If using the non-standard
      bit rates, then it is RECOMMENDED that values in the range 16000
      to 48000 be used.  Non standard rates MUST have a value that is a
      multiple of 400 (this maintains octet alignment and does not then
      require (undefined) padding bits for each frame if not octet
      aligned).

   Optional parameters:

      rate: RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the sampling
      rate.  If the parameter is not specified a clock rate of 16 Khz is
      assumed.

      ptime: see RFC 4566.  SHOULD be a multiple of 20 msec.

      maxptime: see RFC 4566.  SHOULD be a multiple of 20 msec.

   Encoding considerations:

      This media type is framed and binary, see section 4.8 in
      [RFC4288].

   Security considerations: See Section 6

   Interoperability considerations:

      Terminals SHOULD offer a media type at 16 Khz sample rate in order
      to interoperate with terminals that do not support the new 32 Khz
      sample rate.

   Published specification: RFC yyy [see RFCeditor notes].

   Applications which use this media type:

      Audio and Video streaming and conferencing applications.

      Roni Even: roni.even@polycom.co.il

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:

      This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only defined
      for transfer via RTP [RFC3550].  Transport within other framing
      protocols is not defined at this time.

5.  SDP Parameters

   The media types audio/G7221 are mapped to fields in the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] as follows:

   o  The media name in the "m=" line of SDP MUST be audio.

   o  The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be G7221 (the
      media subtype).

   o  The clock rate in the "a=rtpmap" line MUST be 16000 or 32000.  For
      backward compatibility if the optional rate parameter is not
      specified the RTP timestamp clock rate may be based on this
      parameter.

   o  Only one bitrate SHALL be defined (using the "bitrate=" parameter
      in the a=fmtp line) for each payload type.  The optional "rate "
      parameter may be added using a semicolon as a separator.

5.1.  Usage with the SDP Offer Answer Model

   When offering G.722.1 over RTP using SDP in an Offer/Answer model
   [RFC3264] the following considerations are necessary.

   The combination of the clock rate in the rtpmap and the bitrate
   parameter defines the configuration of each payload type.  Each
   configuration intended to be used, MUST be declared.

   There are two sampling clock rates defined for G.722.1 in this
   document.  RFC3047 [RFC3047] supported only the 16 Khz clock rate.
   Therefore a system that wants to use G.722.1 SHOULD offer a payload
   type with clock rate of 16000 for backward interoperability.

   An example of an offer that includes a 16000 and 32000 clock rate is:

             m=audio 49000 RTP/AVP 121 122
             a=rtpmap:121 G7221/16000
             a=fmtp:121 bitrate=24000
             a=rtpmap:122 G7221/32000 ; rate=32000

6.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550], and any appropriate RTP profile.  This
   implies that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by
   encryption.

   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encoding using
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end
   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams
   into the stream which are complex to decode and cause the receiver to
   be overloaded.  However, this encoding does not exhibit any
   significant non-uniformity.

7.  Changes from RFC 3047

   The new draft obsoletes RFC3047 adding the support for the
   Superwideband (14 Khz) audio support defined in annex C of the new
   revision of ITU-T G.722.1.

   Other changes

   Update the text to be in line with the current rules for RFC and with
   media type registration conforming to RFC 4288.
