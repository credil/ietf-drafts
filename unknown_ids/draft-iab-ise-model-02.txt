                         draft-iab-ise-model-02

Abstract

   This document describes the function and responsibilities of the RFC
   Independent Stream Editor (ISE).  The Independent Stream is one of
   the Stream Producers that create draft RFCs, with the ISE as its
   Stream Approver.  The ISE is overall responsible for activities
   within the Independent Stream, working with draft editors and
   reviewers, and interacts with the RFC Production Center and
   Publisher, and the RFC Series Editor.  The ISE is appointed by the
   IAB, and also interacts with the IETF Administrative Oversight
   Committee (IAOC).

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

Internet-Draft     Independent Submission Editor Model      October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The RFC Editor Model [I-D.iab-rfc-editor-model-v2] defines a set of
   Streams that produce draft RFCs, which are submitted for publication.
   This document defines the management function for the Independent
   Stream, specifically the role of Independent Stream Editor.  (This
   document derives from a section of [RFC5620].)

2.  Independent Submission Editor

   The Independent Submission Editor (ISE) is the head of the
   Independent Submission Stream of RFCs, as defined by [RFC4844].  The
   accountability of all RFC Streams Editors is to the body that
   appoints them - the Independent Stream and the Independent Submission
   Editor are not under the authority or direction of the RSE or the
   RSOC.  As noted below, the ISE is appointed by and is responsible
   directly to the IAB.

2.1.  Qualifications

   The Independent Submission Editor is a senior position for which the
   following qualifications are desired:

   1.  Technical competence, i.e., broad technical experience and
       perspective across a wide range of Internet technologies and
       applications, and also the ability to work effectively with
       portions of that spectrum in which they have no personal
       expertise.

   2.  Thorough familiarity with the RFC series.

   3.  An ability to define and constitute advisory and document review
       arrangements.  If those arrangements include an Editorial Board
       similar to the current one or some equivalent arrangement, the
       ability to assess the technical competence of potential Editorial
       Board members (see Section 3)

   4.  Good standing in the technical community, in and beyond the IETF.

   5.  Demonstrated editorial skills, good command of the English
       language, and demonstrated history of being able to work
       effectively with technical documents and materials created by
       others.

   6.  The ability to work effectively in a multi-actor environment with
       divided authority and responsibility similar to that described in
       [I-D.iab-rfc-editor-model-v2].

2.2.  Responsibilities

   The Independent Submission Editor is an individual who may have
   assistants and who is responsible for:

   1.  Maintaining technical quality of the Independent Submission
       stream.

   2.  Reviewing, approving, and processing Independent Submissions.

   3.  Forwarding draft RFCs in the Independent Submission stream to the
       RFC Production Center.

   4.  Defining and developing the scope of the Independent Submission
       stream.

   5.  Reviewing and approving Independent Submissions RFC errata.

   6.  Coordinating work and conforming to general RFC Series policies
       as specified by the IAB and RSE.

   7.  Providing statistics and documentation as requested by the RSE
       and/or IAOC.

   The Independent Submission Editor may create and seek support from an
   advisory board (see [RFC4846]).  Such a board would provide advice to
   the ISE on any aspect of the Independent Stream and itrs activities.

   The individual with the listed qualifications is selected by the IAB
   after input has been collected from the community.  An approach
   similar to the one used by the IAB to select an IAOC member every
   other year as described in [RFC4333] should be used.

   While the ISE itself is considered a volunteer function, the IAB
   considers maintaining the Independent Submission stream part of the
   IAB's supported activities, and that the IAOC should include these
   costs in the IASA budget.

3.  Independent Submission Stream Editorial Board

   The Independent Submission Editor is supported by an Editorial Board
   for the review of Independent Submission stream documents.  This
   board is known as the Independent Submission Stream Editorial Board.
   This volunteer Editorial Board exists at the pleasure of the ISE, and
   its members serve at the pleasure of the ISE.  The existence of this
   board is simply noted within this model, and additional discussion of
   such is considered out of scope of this document.

   This document has no specific security implications.
