1.  Introduction

   The SCHAC international activity was born inside the TF-EMC2
   middleware task force of the Trans European Research and Education
   Network Association.  The initial aim of SCHAC was to harmonise the
   disjoint person schemas of the participating countries in order to
   have a common way for expressing personal data exchanged between
   educational organizations.  Thus, the SCHAC schema was defined with
   input from all participants national person schemas.[3]

   SCHAC does not supplant other person schemas such as
   organizationalPerson [4], inetOrgPerson [5] or eduPerson [6], it
   extends those where needed for the pourposes of Higher Education
   outside the United States.  This characteristic has made SCHAC,
   originally an European effort, useful for groups outside Europe.

   Syntactic structure:

      The Namespace Specific Strings (NSS) of all URNs assigned by SCHAC
      will conform to the syntax defined in section 2.2 of RFC 2141,
      "URN Syntax"[7].  In addition, all SCHAC URN NSSs will consist of
      a left-to-right series of tokens delimited by colons.  The left-
      to-right sequence of colon-delimited tokens corresponds to
      descending nodes in a tree.  To the right of the lowest naming
      authority node, there may be zero, one, or more levels of
      hierarchical naming nodes terminating in a rightmost leaf node.

      See the section below entitled "Identifier assignment" for more on
      the semantics of NSSs.  This syntax convention is captured in the
      following normative ABNF rules for SCHAC NSSs (see RFC 5234[2]):



            SCHAC-NSS    =   1*(subStChar) 0*(":" 1*(subStChar))

            subStChar       =   trans / "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG

            trans                =   ALPHA / DIGIT / other / reserved

            other                =   "(" / ")" / "+" / "," / "-" / "." /
                                         "=" / "@" / ";" / "$" /
                                         "_" / "!" / "*" / "'"

            reserved           =   "%" / "/" / "?" / "#"

      The exclusion of the colon from the list of "other" characters
      means that the colon can only occur as a delimiter between string
      tokens.  Note that this ABNF rule set guarantees that any valid
      SCHAC NSS is also a valid RFC 2141 NSS.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      None.


   Identifier uniqueness:

      It is the responsibility of TERENA to guarantee uniqueness of the
      names of immediately subordinate naming authorities.  Each lower-
      level naming authority in turn inherits the responsibility of
      guaranteeing uniqueness of names in their branch of the naming
      tree.


   Identifier persistence:

      TERENA bears ultimate responsibility for maintaining the usability
      of SCHAC URNs over time.  This responsibility may be delegated to
      subordinate naming authorities per the discussion in the section
      below on identifier assignment.  That section provides a mechanism
      for the delegation to be revoked in the case a subordinate naming
      authority ceases to function.

Internet-Draft             SCHAC URN Namespace                March 2009


   Identifier assignment:

      TERENA will create an initial series of immediately subordinate
      naming authorities, and will define a process for adding to that
      list of authorities.  Each country with a representative in SCHAC
      will be invited to designate a naming authority.  Country specific
      namespaces based on the country Internet TLD [8] will be assigned
      then to the designated authority.  The subordinated namespaces int
      and eu will remain under TERENA authority, controlled by the SCHAC
      activity members, for entities of global international or European
      interest.  There is also the possibility of granting subordinate
      namespaces to multi-country organizations, in this case the
      organizational Internet DNS name will be used as prefix.

      URNs intended for values of SCHAC attributes will include the
      attribute name immediately after the NSS prefix, before any
      geographical namespace delegation, such as any string can convey
      information about the attribute for which it is a value.  For
      example, values for schacUserStatus, will be of the from:



                 urn:schac:UserStatus:int:
                 urn:schac:UserStatus:au: or
                 urn:schac:UserStatus:terena.org

      Automated registry publication mechanisms will be provided if at
      all possible, based on the work on distributed URN registries done
      by the TF-EMC2 task force members.

      Institutions and communities affiliated with SCHAC participants
      may request that they be granted subordinate naming authority
      status.  Uniqueness of this namespaces under each country
      authority will be based on the requestors Internet DNS domain
      name.  This subordination procedure SHOULD be carried along the
      delegation chain, i.e., all entities that receive a delegated
      namespace MUST have a valid DNS name and MUST publish an Internet
      accessible URN value registry, if at all possible based on the URN
      registry mechanisms designed by the TF-EMC2 task force members.

      On at least an annual basis, TERENA will contact the liaisons or
      directors of each immediately subordinate naming authority.  If
      there is no response, or if the respondent indicates that they
      wish to relinquish naming authority, the authority over that
      branch of the tree reverts to TERENA.  This process will be
      enforced recursively by each naming authority on its subordinates.
      This process guarantees that responsibility for each branch of the
      tree will lapse for less than one year, at worst, before being

      reclaimed by a superior authority.

      Lexical equivalence of two SCHAC namespace specific strings (NSSs)
      is defined below as an exact, case-sensitive string match.  TERENA
      will assign names of immediately subordinate naming authorities in
      lowercase only.  This forestalls the registration of two SCHAC-
      subordinate naming authorities whose names differ only in case.
      Attribute names will use the same mixed case format as in the
      schema definition.


   Identifier resolution:

      TERENA will maintain a registry of all SCHAC assigned URN values,
      both final and for delegation, on its Web site:
      https://www.terena.org/urn Delegation entries will have a pointer
      to the registry of the subordinate naming authority.  This SHOULD
      recurse down the delegation tree, but registries for several
      delegated namespaces MAY be maintained by a single naming
      authority.

      All registries MUST publish their URNs over an HTTPS link that
      presents a server certificate by a recognized CA, that does not
      produce an alert in the user's browser.


   Lexical equivalence:

      Lexical equivalence of two SCHAC Namespace Specific Strings (NSSs)
      is defined as an exact, case-sensitive string match.


   Conformance with URN syntax:

      All SCHAC NSSs fully conform to RFC 2141 syntax rules for NSSs.


   Validation mechanism:

      As specified in the "Identifier resolution" section above, TERENA
      will maintain an index of all SCHAC assigned URNs on its Web site
      https://www.terena.org/urn Presence in that registry or in any
      subordinate one implies that a given URN is valid.  Delegated
      naming authorities MUST guarantee that values are valid in their
      assigned spaces.

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations beyond those normally
   associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

   In order to guarantee the validity and origin of SCHAC-NSS URN
   values, they MUST be published over HTTPS links.

4.  Namespace Considerations

   Registration of an Namespace Identifier (NID) specific to SCHAC is
   reasonable given the following considerations:

      SCHAC would like to assign URNs to some very fine-grained objects.
      This does not seem to be the primary intended use of the XMLORG
      namespace (RFC 3120) [9], or the more tightly controlled OASIS
      namespace (RFC 3121) [10].

      SCHAC seeks naming autonomy.  SCHAC is not a member of OASIS, so
      becoming a subordinate naming authority under the OASIS URN space
      is not an option.  There is the MACE namespace but the SCHAC
      development is done outside MACE activity scope and thus the
      attributes and values do not belong into MACE namespace.  Using
      the MACE namespace requires the schac namespace to be placed under
      one of the SCHAC participants namespace, which hinders its global
      scope.

      SCHAC will want to assign URNs to non-XML objects as well.  That
      is another reason that XMLORG may not be an appropriate higher-
      level naming authority for SCHAC.

   Some of the already defined SCHAC attribute values have been assigned
   URNs under the urn:mace:terena.org namespace.  This values will enter
   a deprecation cycle, with clear indication of them being replaced by
   values under the new namespace once it is assigned.  Anyhow, RFC 3406
   [11] (which replaced RFC 2611) includes an explicit statement that
   two or more URNs may point to the same resource.

Internet-Draft             SCHAC URN Namespace                March 2009


5.  Community Considerations

   The assignment and use of identifiers within the namespace are open,
   and the related rule is established by the SCHAC activity members.
   Registration agencies (the next level naming authorities) will be the
   National Research and Education Networks and established
   organizational cross-border organizations that participate in SCHAC.

   It is expected that the majority of the European NRENs, their
   constituencies, participants in the Australian Access Federation and
   some other international activities make use of the SCHAC namespace.

   After the establishment of the SCHAC namespace, TERENA will, as soon
   as practical, establish a registry service (analogously to other
   distributed pan-European services, like EduROAM, PerfSONAR, etc.) for
   the namespace clients.
