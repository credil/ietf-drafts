Abstract

   Mobile IPv6 deployments may want to bootstrap their operations
   dynamically based on an interaction between the Home Agent and the
   Diameter server of the Mobile Service Provider.  This document
   specifies the interaction between a Mobile IP Home Agent and that
   Diameter server.

   Several different mechanisms for authenticating a Mobile Node are
   supported.  The usage of the Internet Key Exchange v2 protocol allows
   different mechanisms, such as the Extensible Authentication Protocol,
   certificates and pre-shared secrets to be used.  Furthermore, another
   method makes use of the Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol.  In
   addition to authentication and authorization, the configuration of
   Mobile IPv6 specific parameters and accounting is specified in this
   document.

Internet-Draft     Diameter MIPv6: HA-to-AAAH Support      December 2008


1.  Introduction

   Performing the Mobile IPv6 protocol [RFC3775], requires the Mobile
   Node (MN) to own a Home Address (HoA) and to have an assigned Home
   Agent (HA) to the MN.  The MN needs to register with the HA in order
   to enable its reachability and mobility, when away from its home
   link.  The registration process itself may require an establishment
   of IPsec security associations (SA) and cryptographic material
   between the MN and the HA.  Alternatively, the registration process
   may be secured using a mobility message authentication option, which
   enables IPv6 mobility in a MN without having to establish an IPsec SA
   with its HA.  Providing the collection of home address, HA address
   and keying material is generally referred to as the Mobile IPv6
   bootstrapping problem [RFC4640].  The purpose of this specification
   is to provide Diameter support for the interaction between the HA and
   the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server.  This
   specification satisfies the requirements defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mext-aaa-ha-goals] for the bootstrapping problem in the
   split scenario [RFC5026] and also specifies Diameter support for the
   Authentication Protocol for Mobile IPv6 [RFC4285].  The Diameter
   support defined in this specification also applies to Dual Stack
   Mobile IPv6 [I-D.ietf-mext-nemo-v4traversal].

   From a Mobility Service Provider (MSP) perspective, it is important
   to verify that the MN is authenticated and authorized to utilize
   Mobile IPv6 service, and is accounted for those.  Only when the MN is
   authenticated and authorized, the MSP allows the bootstrapping of
   Mobile IPv6 parameters.  Thus, prior to processing the Mobile IPv6
   registrations, the HA participates in the authentication of the MN to
   verify the MN's identity.  The HA also participates in the Mobile
   IPv6 authorization process involving the Diameter infrastructure.
   The HA, due to its role in traffic forwarding, may also perform
   accounting for the Mobile IPv6 service provided to the MN.

   This document enables the following functionality:

   Authentication:  Verifying the MN's identity.  As a Diameter client
      supporting the new Diameter Mobile IPv6 application, the HA may
      need to support more than one authentication type depending on the
      environment.  Although the authentication is performed by the AAA
      server there is an impact for the HA as different set of command
      codes are needed for the respective authentication procedures.


   Authorization:  The HA must verify that the user is authorized to the
      Mobile IPv6 service using the assistance of the MSP Diameter
      servers.  This is accomplished through the use of new Diameter
      applications specifically designed for performing Mobile IPv6

      authorization decisions.  This document defines required AAA
      procedures and requires the HA to support them and to participate
      in this authorization signaling.


   Accounting:  For accounting purposes and capacity planning, it is
      required that the HA provides accounting reports to the Diameter
      infrastructure and thus to support the related Diameter accounting
      procedures.


   Session Management:  The management of the mobility services may
      require the Diameter server or the HA to terminate the Mobile IPv6
      service before the binding expires.  This document defines
      procedures for the AAA based session management.

                      Figure 1: Architecture Overview

   Mobile IPv6 signaling between the MN and the HA can be protected
   using two different mechanisms, namely using IPsec or the
   Authentication Protocol for Mobile IPv6 [RFC4285].  For these two
   approaches several different authentication and key exchange
   solutions are available.  When IPsec is used to protect Mobile IPv6
   signaling messages, Internet Key Exchange v2 (IKEv2) is used
   [RFC4877] for the setup of the IPsec SAs.  IKEv2 supports Extensible
   Authentication Protocol (EAP) based initiator authentication,
   certificates and pre-shared secrets.  Alternatively, the
   Authentication Protocol for Mobile IPv6 uses a mechanism that is very
   similar to the one used for protecting Mobile IPv4 signaling
   messages.

   The ability to use different credentials and methods to authenticate
   the MN has an impact on the AAA interactions between the HA (acting
   as a Diameter client) and the Diameter Server.  This specification is
   only limited to the following MN authentication methods:

   o  IKEv2 usage with EAP

   o  Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol

   New authentication mechanisms may be added later by separate
   specifications.

   For accounting of Mobile IPv6 services provided to the MN, this
   specification uses the Diameter Base Protocol accounting defined in
   RFC 3588 [RFC3588].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping terminology is taken from [RFC4640].
   Additional terminology is defined below:

   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA):

      AAA protocol based on Diameter [RFC3588] with required EAP support
      [RFC4072].


   Home AAA (AAAH):

      An authentication, authorization and accounting server located in
      user's home network i.e., in the home realm.

3.  Application Identifiers

   This specification defines two new Diameter applications and their
   respective Application Identifiers:

      Diameter Mobile IPv6 IKE   (MIP6I)  TBD by IANA
      Diameter Mobile IPv6 Auth  (MIP6A)  TBD by IANA


   The MIP6I Application Identifier is used when the MN is authenticated
   and authorized using IKEv2.  The MIP6A Application Identifier is used
   when the MN is authenticated and authorized using the Mobile IPv6
   Authentication Protocol.

   Mobile IPv6 related accounting information generated by the HA uses
   either the MIP6I or the MIP6A Application Identifier in the case of
   coupled accounting model.  The Diameter Base Accounting Application
   Identifier (value of 3) is used in case of the split accounting
   model.  Refer to Section 4.4 for more information regarding the
   accounting models.

4.  Protocol Description

4.1.  Support for Mobile IPv6 with IKEv2 and EAP

   The use of IKEv2 with EAP between the MN and the HA allows the AAA to
   authenticate the MN.  When EAP is used with IKEv2, the Diameter EAP
   application logic and procedures, as defined in [RFC4072], are re-
   used.  EAP methods that do not establish a shared key SHOULD NOT be
   used, as they are subject to a number of man-in-the-middle attacks as
   stated in Section 2.16 and Section 5 of RFC 4306 [RFC4306].  AVPs
   specific to Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping are added to the EAP
   application commands.

   Figure 2 shows the message flow involved during the authentication
   phase when EAP is used.

Internet-Draft     Diameter MIPv6: HA-to-AAAH Support      December 2008


   In this phase cryptographic algorithms are negotiated, nonces and
   Diffie-Hellman parameters are exchanged.  Message (3) starts the
   IKE_AUTH phase.  This second phase authenticates the previous
   messages, exchanges identities and certificates and establishes the
   first CHILD_SA.  It is used to mutually authenticate the MN (acting
   as an IKEv2 Initiator) and the HA (acting as an IKEv2 Responder).
   The identity of the user/MN is provided in the IDi field.  The MN
   indicates its willingness to be authenticated via EAP by omitting the
   AUTH field in message (3) (see Section 2.16 of [RFC4306]).

   As part of the authentication process, the MN MAY request a Home-
   Address, a Home Prefix or suggests one, see [RFC4877], using a
   CFG_REQUEST payload in the message (3).

   The HA extracts the IDi field from the message (3) and sends a
   Diameter-EAP-Request (DER) message (4) towards the authenticating
   Diameter server.  The EAP-Payload AVP contains a EAP-Response/
   Identity with the identity extracted from the IDi field.

   This message is routed to the MN's Diameter server/EAP server.  The
   Diameter server selects the EAP method and replies with the Diameter-
   EAP-Answer (DEA) Message.  Depending on the type of EAP method
   chosen, a number of DER and DEA messages carry the method specific
   exchanges between the MN and the Diameter server/EAP server.

   At the end of the EAP authentication phase, the Diameter server
   indicates the result of the authentication in the Result-Code AVP and
   provides the corresponding EAP packet (EAP Success or EAP Failure).
   The last IKEv2 message sent by the HA contains the Home Address or
   the Home Prefix.  In the latter case, a CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange is
   necessary to setup IPsec SAs for Mobile IPv6 signaling.

   In some deployment scenarios, the HA may also acts as a IKEv2
   Responder for IPsec VPN access.  A challenge in this case is that the
   IKEv2 responder may not know if IKEv2 is used for Mobile IPv6 service
   or for IPsec VPN access service.  A network operator needs to be
   aware of this limitation.  The MN may provide a hint of the intended
   service, for example, by using different identities in the IKE_AUTH
   message for the IPsec VPN service and Mobile IPv6 service.  However,
   the use of different identities during the IKEv2 negotiation is
   deployment specific.  Another possibility is to make the distinction
   on the MN subscription basis.  In this case the Diameter server can
   inform the HA during the IKEv2 negotiation whether the MN is
   provisioned with an IPsec VPN access service or Mobile IPv6 service.

   Eventually, when the HA receives a Binding Update (BU), the HA
   authenticates and authorizes the MN.  It is RECOMMENDED that the HA
   sends an accounting request message every time it receives a BU.

4.2.  Support for the Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol

   Figure 3 shows the message sequence between the MN, the HA and the
   Diameter server during the registration when Mobile IPv6
   Authentication Protocol is used.  A BU and a Binding Acknowledgement
   (BA) messages are used in the binding registration process.

   Receiving a BU at the HA initiates a MIP6-Request to be sent to the
   Diameter server.  The Diameter server in turn responds with a MIP6-
   Answer.  The HA may assign a Home Address to the MN and provide it to
   the Diameter server in the MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP.

   According to [RFC4285] the MN uses the Mobile Node Identifier Option,
   specifically the MN-NAI mobility option (as defined in [RFC4283]) to
   identify itself.  The HA MUST copy the MN-NAI mobility option value
   to the User-Name AVP in the subsequent request messages.

   The procedure described in this specification for the Mobile IPv6
   Authentication Protocol is only needed for the initially received BU
   for which the HA does not have an existing security association.
   When the HA receives subsequent BUs, they are processed locally in
   the HA.  It is RECOMMENDED that the HA sends an accounting request
   message every time it receives a Binding Update.  However, the HA MAY
   re-authorize the MN with the Diameter server at any time depending on
   the deployment and the local policy.

   In some architectures and network deployments the MN-HA security
   associations may be established as a result of a successful network
   access authentication.  In such deployments, both the MN and the
   Diameter server share the keying material required for computation
   and validation of the MN-HA Authentication Option, and a Security
   Parameter Index (SPI) for indexing an appropriate security
   association.  Upon receiving a BU with a MN-HA Authentication Option,
   the HA retrieves the keying material required for the computation and
   validation of the MN-HA Authentication Option from the Diameter
   server.  The Diameter request message sent by the HA must contain
   enough information (such as SPI, MN-NAI, etc) so that the Diameter
   server is able to locate the matching MN-HA security association and
   return correct keying material back to the HA.

   This specification assumes that in the case Mobile IPv6
   Authentication Protocol is used, the MN-AAA option is included in the
   BU.  Other possible uses of Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol are
   out of scope of this specification and would require a new
   specification to describe the detailed behavior of the HA-AAAH
   interface.  However, the HA-AAAH interface has been designed in a way
   that the Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol may also be used without
   the MN-AAA option.

4.3.  Mobile IPv6 Session Management

   The Diameter server may maintain state or may be stateless.  This is
   indicated in the Auth-Session-State AVP (or its absence).  The HA
   MUST support the Authorization Session State Machine defined in
   [RFC3588].

   This specification makes an assumption that each SA created between
   the MN and the HA as a result of a successful IKEv2 negotiation or a
   Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol exchange correspond to one
   Diameter session.

4.3.1.  Session-Termination-Request

   The Session-Termination-Request (STR) message [RFC3588] is sent by
   the HA to inform the Diameter server that an authorized session is
   being terminated.  This means that the HA MUST terminate the
   corresponding Mobile IPv6 binding and also terminate the
   corresponding SA.

4.3.2.  Session-Termination-Answer

   The Session-Termination-Answer (STA) message [RFC3588] is sent by the
   Diameter server to acknowledge the notification that the session has
   been terminated.

4.3.3.  Abort-Session-Request

   The Abort-Session-Request (ASR) message [RFC3588] is sent by the
   Diameter server to the HA to terminate the authorized session.  This
   fulfills one of the requirement described in
   [I-D.ietf-mext-aaa-ha-goals].  When the HA receives the ASR message,
   it MUST terminate the corresponding SA.  Subsequently, the HA MUST
   take further actions to terminate the corresponding Mobile IPv6
   binding.

4.3.4.  Abort-Session-Answer

   The Abort-Session-Answer (ASA) message [RFC3588] is sent by the Home
   Agent in response to an ASR message.

4.4.  Accounting for Mobile IPv6 services

   The HA MUST be able act as a Diameter client collecting accounting
   records needed for service control and charging.  The HA MUST support
   the accounting procedures (specifically the command codes mentioned
   below) and the Accounting Session State Machine as defined in
   [RFC3588].  The command codes, exchanged between the HA and Diameter
   server for accounting purposes, are provided in the following
   subsections.

   The Diameter application design guideline
   [I-D.ietf-dime-app-design-guide] defines two separate models for
   accounting:

   Split accounting model:

      According to this model, the accounting messages use the Diameter
      Base Accounting Application Identifier (value of 3).  Since
      accounting is treated as an independent application, accounting
      commands may be routed separately from the rest of application
      messages and thus the accounting messages generally end up in a
      central accounting server.  Since Diameter Mobile IPv6 application
      does not define its own unique accounting commands, this is the
      preferred choice, since it permits use of centralized accounting
      for several applications.


   Coupled accounting model:

      In this model, the accounting messages will use either the MIP6I
      or the MIP6A Application Identifiers.  This means that accounting
      messages will be routed like any other Mobile IPv6 application
      messages.  This requires the Diameter server in charge of Mobile

      IPv6 application to handle the accounting records (e.g., sends
      them to a proper accounting server).

   As mentioned above, the preferred choice is to use the split
   accounting model and thus to choose Diameter Base Accounting
   Application Identifier (value of 3) for accounting messages.

4.4.1.  Accounting-Request

   The Accounting-Request command [RFC3588] is sent by the HA to the
   Diameter server to exchange accounting information regarding the MN
   with the Diameter server.

4.4.2.  Accounting-Answer

   The Accounting-Answer command [RFC3588] is sent by the Diameter
   server to the HA to acknowledge an Accounting-Request.

5.  Command Codes

5.1.  Command Code for Mobile IPv6 with IKEv2 and EAP

   For the use of Mobile IPv6 with IKEv2 and EAP this document reuses
   the Diameter EAP application [RFC4072] commands: Diameter-EAP-Request
   (DER) and Diameter-EAP-Answer (DEA).  This specification extends the
   existing DER and DEA command ABNFs with a number AVPs to support
   Mobile IPv6 split scenario bootstrapping.  Other than new additional
   AVPs and the corresponding additions to the command ABNFs, the
   Diameter EAP application command ABNFs remain unchanged.  The ABNF
   language is defined in [RFC3588].

   Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping AVPs are only included in the first DER
   message send by the HA.  The subsequent DER messages required by the
   EAP-method do not need to include any Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping AVPs.
   The MN is both authenticated and authorized for the mobility service
   during the EAP authentication.  Thus, the Auth-Request-Type AVP MUST
   be set to the value AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE.

   The Diameter-EAP-Answer (DEA) message, indicated by the Command-Code
   field set to 268 and 'R' bit cleared in the Command Flags field, is
   sent in response to the Diameter-EAP-Request message (DER).  The
   Application-Id field in the Diameter message header MUST be set to

   Mobile IPv6 authentication procedure was successful then the response
   MAY include any set of bootstrapping AVPs.

   EAP-method do not include any Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping AVPs.

5.2.  Command Codes for Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol Support

   This section defines the commands that are used for support with the
   Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol.

   There are multiple ways of deploying and utilizing Mobile IPv6
   Authentication Protocol, especially regarding the associated AAA
   interactions.  In order to support multiple deployment models this
   specification defines the MIP6-Auth-Mode AVP that in the request
   message tells the mode that the HA supports.  This specification
   defines a method that requires the use of the MN-AAA option with the
   Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol.

   To provide support for RFC 4285 [RFC4285] and for RFC 4877 [RFC4877]
   the AVPs in the following subsections are needed.  RFC 3588, RFC 4004
   and RFC 4005 [RFC4005] defined AVPs are reused whenever possible
   without changing the existing semantics of those AVPs.

                 AVPs for the Mobile IPv6 Auth Application

   Note 1: The MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP is defined in Section 4.7.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-integrated].

   Note 2: The QoS-Capability and the QoS-Resource AVPs are defined in
   Sections 4.1 and 4.3 of [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-attributes].

   Note 3: The MIP6-Agent-Info AVP is defined in Section 4.5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-integrated].

6.1.  User-Name AVP

   The User-Name AVP (AVP Code 1) is of type UTF8String and contains an
   NAI extracted from the MN-NAI mobility option included in the
   received BU message.  Alternatively, the NAI can be extracted from
   the IKEv2 IDi payload included in the IKE_AUTH message sent by the
   IKE initiator.

6.2.  Service-Selection AVP

   The Service-Selection AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type UTF8String and
   contains the name of the service or the external network that the
   mobility service should be associated with.  In the scope of this
   specification the value can extracted from the IKEv2 IDr payload, if
   available in the IKE_AUTH message sent by the IKE initiator.
   Alternatively, if the Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol is used,
   then the Service-Selection AVP contains the string extracted from the
   Service Selection Mobility Option [RFC5149], if available in the
   received BU.  Future specification may define additional ways to
   populate the Service-Selection AVP with the required information.

   The AVP is also available to be used in messages sent from the
   Diameter server to the Diameter client.  For example, if the request
   message did not contain the Service-Selection AVP but the MN was
   assigned with a default service, the Diameter server MAY return the

Internet-Draft     Diameter MIPv6: HA-to-AAAH Support      December 2008


   name of the assigned default service to the HA.

   If the Service-Selection AVP is present in both the request and the
   reply messages, it SHOULD contain the same service name.  If the
   services differ, the HA MAY treat that as authorization failure.

6.3.  MIP-MN-AAA-SPI AVP

   The MIP-MN-AAA-SPI AVP (AVP Code 341) is of type Unsigned32 and
   contains an SPI code extracted from the Mobility Message
   Authentication Option included in the received BU message.  The HA
   includes this AVP in the MIR message when the MN-AAA Mobility Message
   Authentication Option is available in the received BU (and the MIP6-
   Auth-Mode AVP is set to value MIP6_AUTH_MN_AAA).

   This AVP is re-used from [RFC4004].

6.4.  MIP-MN-HA-SPI AVP

   The MIP-MN-HA-SPI AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32 and
   contains an SPI value that can be used with other parameters for
   identifying the security association required for the validation of
   the Mobile IPv6 MN-HA Authentication Option.

   When included in the MIR message, the Diameter server needs to return
   a valid MIP-MN-HA-MSA AVP in the corresponding MIA message.  Either
   the MIP-MN-HA-SPI AVP or the MIP-MN-AAA-SPI AVP MUST be present in
   the MIR message, but not both.

6.5.  MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP

   The MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP (AVP Code 333) is of type Address and
   contains the HA assigned IPv6 or IPv4 Home Address of the Mobile
   Node.

   If the MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP contains the unspecified IPv6
   address (0::0) or the all zeroes IPv4 address (0.0.0.0) in a request
   message, then the HA expects the Diameter server to assign the Home
   Address in a subsequent answer message.  If the Diameter server
   assigns only an IPv6 Home Network Prefix to the Mobile Node the lower
   64 bits of the MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP provided address MUST be
   set to zero.

   This AVP is re-used from [RFC4004].

Internet-Draft     Diameter MIPv6: HA-to-AAAH Support      December 2008


6.6.  MIP6-Agent-Info AVP

   The MIP6-Agent-Info AVP is defined in Section 4.5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-integrated] and contains the IPv6 or the IPv4
   address information of the HA.  The HA address in a request message
   is the same as in the received BU message that triggered the
   authentication and authorization procedure towards the Diameter
   server.  One use case is e.g., to inform the Diameter server of the
   dynamically assigned HA.

   If the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP is present in an answer message and the
   Result-Code AVP is set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS_RELOCATE_HA, then the
   Diameter server is indicating to the HA that it MUST initiate a HA
   switch procedure towards the MN (e.g., using the procedure defined in
   [RFC5142]).  If the Result-Code AVP is set to any other value, then
   the HA SHOULD initiate the HA switch procedure towards the MN.  The
   address information of the assigned HA is defined in the MIP6-Agent-
   Info AVP.

6.7.  MIP-Careof-Address AVP

   The MIP-Careof-Address AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Address and
   contains the IPv6 Care-of Address of the Mobile Node.  The HA
   extracts this IP address from the received BU message.

6.8.  MIP-Authenticator AVP

   The MIP-Authenticator AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and
   contains the Authenticator Data from the received BU message.  The HA
   extracts this data from the MN-AAA Mobility Message Authentication
   Option included in the received BU message.  The HA includes this AVP
   in the MIR message and sets the Diameter server is expected to return
   the key material required for the calculation and validation of the
   Mobile IPv6 MN-HA Authentication Option (and the MIP6-Auth-Mode AVP
   is set to value MIP6_AUTH_MN_AAA).

6.9.  MIP-MAC-Mobility-Data AVP

   The MIP-MAC-Mobility-Data AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString
   and contains the calculated MAC_Mobility_Data, as defined in
   [RFC4285].  The HA includes this AVP in the MIR message when the MN-
   AAA Mobility Message Authentication Option is available in the
   received BU and the Diameter server is expected to return the key
   material required for the calculation and validation of the Mobile
   IPv6 MN-HA Authentication Option (and the MIP6-Auth-Mode AVP is set
   to value MIP6_AUTH_MN_AAA).

Internet-Draft     Diameter MIPv6: HA-to-AAAH Support      December 2008


6.10.  MIP-Session-Key AVP

   The MIP-Session-Key AVP (AVP Code 343) is of type OctetString and
   contains the MN-HA shared secret (i.e., the session key) for the
   associated Mobile IPv6 MH-HA authentication option.  When the
   Diameter server computes the session key it is placed in this AVP.

   This AVP is re-used from [RFC4004].

6.11.  MIP-MSA-Lifetime AVP

   The MIP-MSA-Lifetime AVP (AVP Code 367) is of type Unsigned32 and
   represents the period of time (in seconds) for which the session key
   (see Section 6.10) is valid.  The associated session key MUST NOT be
   used if the lifetime has expired.

   This AVP is re-used from [RFC4004].

6.12.  MIP-MN-HA-MSA AVP

   The MIP-MN-HA-MSA AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and contains
   the session related information for use with the Mobile IPv6
   Authentication Protocol.


   MIP-MN-HA-MSA ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                     { MIP-Session-Key }
                     { MIP-MSA-Lifetime }
                     [ MIP-MN-HA-SPI ]
                     [ MIP-Algorithm-Type ]
                     [ MIP-Replay-Mode ]
                   * [ AVP ]

   The MIP-MN-HA-SPI sub-AVP within the MIP-MN-HA-MSA grouped AVP
   identifies the security association required for the validation of
   the Mobile IPv6 MN-HA Authentication Option.

6.13.  MIP-Algorithm-Type AVP

   The MIP-Algorithm-Type AVP (AVP Code 345) is of type Enumerated and
   contains Algorithm identifier for the associated Mobile IPv6 MN-HA
   Authentication Option.  The Diameter server selects the algorithm
   type.  Existing algorithm types are defined in RFC 4004 that also
   fulfill current RFC 4285 requirements.

   This AVP is re-used from [RFC4004].

Internet-Draft     Diameter MIPv6: HA-to-AAAH Support      December 2008


6.14.  MIP-Replay-Mode AVP

   The MIP-Replay-Mode AVP (AVP Code 346) is of type Enumerated and
   contains the replay mode the HA for authenticating the mobile node.
   The replay modes, defined in RFC 4004 [RFC4004], are supported.

   This AVP is re-used from [RFC4004].

6.15.  MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP

   The MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned64 and
   defined in [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-integrated].  This document defines a
   new capability flag for signaling the support of Mobile IPv6 split
   scenario bootstrapping.

   MIP6_SPLIT (0x0000000100000000)

      When this flag is set by the NAS then it means that the Mobile
      IPv6 split scenario bootstrapping functionality is supported by
      the NAS.  When this flag is set by the Diameter server then the
      Mobile IPv6 split scenario bootstrapping is supported by the
      Diameter server.


6.16.  MIP-Timestamp AVP

   The MIP-Timestamp AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Time and may contain
   the timestamp value from the Mobility message replay protection
   option, defined in [RFC4285].  The HA extracts this value from the
   received BU message, if available.  The HA includes this AVP in the
   MIR message when the MN-AAA Mobility Message Authentication Option is
   available in the received BU and the Diameter server is expected to
   return the key material required for the calculation and validation
   of the Mobile IPv6 MN-HA Authentication Option (and the MIP6-Auth-
   Mode AVP is set to value MIP6_AUTH_MN_AAA).

6.17.  QoS-Capability AVP

   The QoS-Capability AVP is defined in [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-attributes]
   and contains a list of supported Quality of Service profiles.

6.18.  QoS-Resources AVP

   The QoS-Resources AVP is defined in [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-attributes]
   and provides QoS and packet filtering capabilities.

Internet-Draft     Diameter MIPv6: HA-to-AAAH Support      December 2008


6.19.  Chargeable-User-Identity AVP

   The Chargeable-User-Identity AVP (AVP code 89) is of type OctetString
   and contains an unique temporary handle of the user.  The Chargeable-
   User-Identity is defined in RFC 4372 [RFC4372].

6.20.  MIP6-Auth-Mode AVP

   The MIP6-Auth-Mode (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated and contains
   information of the used Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol mode.
   This specification defines only one value MIP6_AUTH_MN_AAA and the
   corresponding AAA interactions when MN-AAA security association is
   used to authenticate the Binding Update.  When the MIP6-Auth_Mode AVP
   is set to the value of MIP6_AUTH_MN_AAA, the Auth-Request-Type AVP
   MUST be set to the value of AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE.

   If the Diameter server does not support the Mobile IPv6
   Authentication Protocol usage mode proposed by the HA, then the
   Diameter server MUST fail the authentication/authorization and MUST
   set the Result-Code AVP to the value of DIAMETER_ERROR_AUTH_MODE.

6.21.  Accounting AVPs

   Diameter Mobile IPv6 applications, either MIP6I or MIP6A, are used in
   the case of the coupled account model.  Diameter Mobile IPv4
   application [RFC4004] accounting AVPs are reused in this document.
   The following AVPs SHOULD be included in the accounting request
   message:

   o  Accounting-Input-Octets: Number of octets in IP packets received
      from the mobile node.

   o  Accounting-Output-Octets: Number of octets in IP packets sent by
      the mobile node

   o  Accounting-Input-Packets: Number of IP packets received from the
      mobile node.

   o  Accounting-Output-Packets: Number of IP packets sent by the mobile
      node.

   o  Acct-Multi-Session-Id: Used to link together multiple related
      accounting sessions, where each session would have a unique
      Session-Id, but the same Acct-Multi-Session-Id AVP.

   o  Acct-Session-Time: Indicates the length of the current session in
      seconds.

   o  MIP6-Feature-Vector: The supported features for this mobility
      service session.

   o  MIP-Mobile-Node-Address: The Home Address of the mobile node.

   o  MIP-Agent-Info: The current home agent of the mobile node.

   o  Chargeable-User-Identity: The unique temporary identity of the
      user.  This AVP MUST be included if it is available in the home
      agent.

   o  Service-Selection: Currently selected mobility service.

   o  QoS-Resources: Assigned QoS resources for the mobile node.

   o  QoS-Capability: The QoS capability related to the assigned QoS-
      Resources.

   o  MIP-Careof-Address: The current Care-of Address of the mobile
      node.

7.  Result-Code AVP Values

   This section defines new Result-Code [RFC3588] values that MUST be
   supported by all Diameter implementations that conform to this
   specification.

7.1.  Success

   Errors that fall within the Success category are used to inform a
   peer that a request has been successfully completed.

   DIAMETER_SUCCESS_RELOCATE_HA (Status Code TBD)

      This result code is used by the Diameter server to inform the HA
      that the MN MUST be switched to another HA.

7.2.  Permanent Failures

   Errors that fall within the permanent failures category are used to
   inform the peer that the request failed and SHOULD NOT be attempted
   again.

   DIAMETER_ERROR_MIP6_AUTH_MODE (Status Code TBD)

      This error code is used by the Diameter server to inform the peer
      that the requested Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol usage mode
      is not supported.

10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the Diameter interaction required to
   accomplish the split scenario are described in in [RFC5026].
   Additionally, the security considerations of the Diameter Base
   protocol [RFC3588], Diameter EAP application [RFC4072] are applicable
   to this document.

   The Diameter messages may be transported between the HA and the
   Diameter server via one or more AAA brokers or Diameter agents.  In
   this case the HA to the Diameter server AAA communication rely on the
   security properties of the intermediate AAA brokers and Diameter
   agents (such as proxies).
