1.  Introduction

   Requirements for establishing Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic
   Engineering (MPLS-TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) that cross multiple
   Autonomous Systems (ASes) are described in [RFC4216].  As described
   in [RFC4216], a method SHOULD provide the ability to compute a path
   spanning multiple ASes.  So a path computation entity that may be the
   head-end Label Switching Router (LSR), an AS Border Router (ASBR), or
   a Path Computation Element [PCE] needs to know the TE information not
   only of the links within an AS, but also of the links that connect to
   other ASes.

   As described in [RFC5392], two new LSAs are defined to advertise
   inter-AS TE information for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 separately, and three
   new sub-TLVs are added to the existing Link TLV to carry the
   information about the neighboring AS and the remote ASBR.  [RFC5316]
   defines similar extensions for [ISIS].

   In order for bidirectional path computation, PCE needs to get
   bidirectional Inter-AS TE link information.  [RFC5392] introduces a
   "proxy" for the ASBR at the edge of the other AS and generate a
   bidirectional TE link.

   This document extends BRPC in order to support the bidirectional path
   computation within single procedure.  Based on the mechanism in this
   document, we don't need to introduce the 'proxy'.  It shows how the
   Backward-Recursive PCE-Based Computation (BRPC) - procedures for
   Inter-AS TE Links can be extended in order for deriving the optimum
   end-to-end bidirectional path.

   This document does not propose or define any mechanisms to advertise
   any other extra-AS TE information within IGP.

3.  Problem statement

3.1.  Inter-AS TE link

   As mentioned in [RFC5392] and [RFC5316], Hellos MUST NOT be exchanged
   over the Inter-AS TE link, and consequently, an IGP adjacency MUST
   NOT be formed.

   In the current operation of TE IGP, the LSRs at each end of a TE link
   emit LSAs describing the link.  The databases in the LSRs then have
   two entries (one locally generated, the other from the peer) that
   describe the different 'directions' of the link.  This enables
   Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) to do a two-way check on the
   link when performing path computation and eliminate it from
   consideration unless both directions of the link satisfy the required
   constraints.

   In the case we are considering here (i.e., of a TE link to another
   AS), there is, by definition, no IGP peering and hence no
   bidirectional TE link information.

   The information advertised comes from the ASBR's knowledge of the
   unidirectional TE capabilities of the link, the ASBR's knowledge of

   the unidirectional current status and usage of the link, and
   configuration at the ASBR of the remote AS number and remote ASBR TE
   Router ID.

   For other properties, e.g., bandwidth and metrics, an ASBR is
   difficult or impossible to get the latest value of these properties
   about reverse directional of Inter-AS TE links timely.  In order for
   the CSPF route computation entity to include the link as a candidate
   path, we have to find a way to solve this problem.

3.2.  Backward Recursive Path Computation

   The Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) [RFC5441] procedure
   involves cooperation and communication between PCEs in order to
   compute an optimal end-to-end path across multiple domains.  In
   particular, the PCC sends a PCReq to a PCE in its domain.  The
   request is forwarded between PCEs, domain-by-domain, until the PCE
   responsible for the domain containing the LSP destination is reached.
   The PCE in the destination domain creates a tree of potential paths
   to the destination (the Virtual Shortest Path Tree - VSPT) and passes
   this back to the previous PCE in a PCRep.  Each PCE in turn adds to
   the VSPT and passes it back until the PCE in the source domain uses
   the VSPT to select an end-to-end path that the PCE sends to the PCC.

   VSPT(i) defined in [RFC5441]:

   In each domain i:

   o  There is a set of X-en(i) entry BNs noted BN-en(k,i) where BN-
      en(k,i) is the kth entry BN of domain(i).

   o  There is a set of X-ex(i) exit BNs noted BN-ex(k,i) where BN-
      ex(k,i) is the kth exit BN of domain(i).

   VSPT(i): MP2P (multipoint-to-point) tree returned by PCE(i) to
   PCE(i-1):


                        Root (TE LSP destination)
                        /         |          \
                   BN-en(1,i)   BN-en(2,i) ... BN-en(j,i).

                   where [X-en(i)] is the number of
                   entry BNs in domain i and j<= [X-en(i)]

   Each link of tree VSPT(i) represents the shortest constrained path
   between BN-en(j,i) and the TE LSP destination that satisfies the set
   of required constraints for the TE LSP (bandwidth, affinities, etc.).

   Note that PCE(i) only considers the entry BNs of domain(i), i.e.,
   only the BNs that provide connectivity from domain(i-1).  In other
   words, the set BN-en(k,i) is only made of those BNs that provide
   connectivity from domain (i-1) to domain(i).  Furthermore, some BNs
   may be excluded according to policy constraints (either due to local
   policy or policies signaled in the path computation request).

   BRPC procedure defined in [RFC5441]:

   Step 1:  First, the PCC needs to determine the PCE capable of serving
      its path computation request (this can be done with local
      configuration or via IGP discovery (see [RFC5088] and [RFC5089])).
      The path computation request is then relayed until reaching a
      PCE(n) such that the TE LSP destination resides in the domain(n).

   Step 2:  PCE(n) computes VSPT(n), the tree made of the list of
      shortest constrained paths between every BN-en(j,n) and the TE LSP
      destination using a suitable path computation algorithm (e.g.,
      CSPF) and returns the computed VSPT(n) to PCE(n-1).

   Step i:  For i=n-1 to 2: PCE(i) computes VSPT(i), the tree made of
      the shortest constrained paths between each BN-en(j,i) and the TE
      LSP destination.  It does this by considering its own TED and the
      information in VSPT(i+1).

   Step n:  Finally, PCE(1) computes the end-to-end shortest constrained
      path

   In the case of inter-domain LSP computation, PCE(i)(i=n-1 to 2) also
   requires adding the inter-AS TE links that connect the domain(i) and
   the domain(i+1).  So the BRPC procedure requires the knowledge of the
   traffic engineering attributes of the bidirectional inter-domain TE
   links at step i.


4.  Solutions of Inter-AS bidirectional path computation

   When multiple PCEs cooperate each other to compute a bidirectional
   Inter-AS LSP by using BRPC, PCE(i+1) selects some proper Inter-AS TE
   links including traffic engineering capabilities, current status and
   usage whose direction is from AS(i+1) to AS(i).  These Inter-AS TE
   links satisfy the required set of unidirectional TE constraints, So
   PCE(i+1) sends PCRep message to PCE(i) including the selected
   unidirectional Inter-AS TE links.  The bidirectional Inter-AS TE

Internet-Draft      BRPC Ext. for Inter-AS Bidir. LSP           Jan 2011


   links that satisfy the constraints can then be derived by PCE(i).

4.1.  Extensions of Backward-Recursive PCE-Based Computation (BRPC)

   In order to solve the problem about Inter-AS TE links described in
   previous section, the extension of BRPC procedure for bidirectional
   Inter-AS TE LSP is described as follows:

   o  After computing the shortest constrained paths(i.e., VSPT) between
      every entry BN and the TE LSP destination, PCE(i+1) selects the
      Inter-AS TE links from AS(i+1) to AS(i) that satisfy the
      constraints and passes them back to the PCE(i) in a PCRep.

   o  Then, the PCE(i) should choose among the Inter-AS TE links carried
      in received PCRep message that satisfy the constraints in the
      reverse direction ,and compute the shortest constrained paths
      between every exit BN and the TE LSP destination.

   Following is the extended BRPC procedure:

   o  Step 1:

      First, the PCC needs to determine the PCE capable of serving its
      path computation request (this can be done with local
      configuration or via IGP discovery (see [RFC5088] and [RFC5089])).
      The path computation request is then relayed until reaching a
      PCE(n) such that the TE LSP destination resides in the domain(n).
      This step is the same as described in [RFC5441].

   o  Step 2:

      2.1.  PCE(n) computes the list of shortest constrained paths
      between every BN-en(j,n) and the TE LSP destination;

      2.2.  PCE(n) selects the Inter-AS TE links that satisfy the
      constraints from all of the Inter-AS TE links that provide
      connectivity from domain (n) to domain(n-1);

      2.3.  PCE(n) returns PCRep (including result of 2.1 and 2.2) to
      PCE(n-1).

      Note that for unidirectional LSP computation, step 2.2 may not be
      performed.

   o  Step i:

      For i=n-1 to 2: {

      i.1.  With the Inter-AS TE links returned from PCE(i+1), PCE(i)
      chooses the links that satisfy the constraints in the reverse
      direction(i.e., the selected Inter-AS TE links satisfy the
      required constraints in both of the directions.)

      i.2.  PCE(i) computes the shortest constrained paths between each
      BN-ex(j,i) and the TE LSP destination;

      i.3.  PCE(i) computes the shortest constrained paths between each
      BN-en(j,i) and the TE LSP destination;

      i.4.  PCE(i) selects the Inter-AS TE links that unidirectionally
      satisfy the constraints from all of the Inter-AS TE links that
      provide connectivity from domain (i) to domain(i-1);

      i.5.  PCE(i) returns PCRep (including result of i.3 and i.4) to
      PCE(i-1). }

      Note that for unidirectional LSP computation, step i.1, i.2 and
      i.4 may not be performed.

   o  Step n:

      n.1.  With the Inter-AS TE links returned from PCE(2), PCE(1)
      chooses the links that satisfy the constraints in the reverse
      direction (i.e., the selected Inter-AS TE links satisfy the
      required constraints in both of the directions.);

      n.2.  PCE(1) computes the shortest constrained paths between each
      BN-ex(j,1) and the TE LSP destination;

      n.3.  Finally, PCE(1) computes the end-to-end shortest constrained
      path.

      Note that for unidirectional LSP computation, step n.1.and n.2.
      may not be performed.

   Note that uni-direction represents the direction from entry BNs of
   local domain i to exit BNs of domain i-1, the reverse direction
   represents the direction from exit BNs of local domain i to entry BNs
   of domain i+1.

4.2.  Extensions of PCEP

4.2.1.  IVSPT flag

   PCEP needs to be introduced a new flag in RP object carried within
   the PCReq message (defined in [RFC5440]).  The PCE(i) set this flag

   in PCReq to indicates that the Inter-AS TE links from AS(i+1) to
   AS(i) satisfying the constraints must be return.  In other words, the
   PCE(i) requests the computation of an inter-domain TE LSP using the
   new BRPC procedure defined in this document.  The IVSPT Flag set in
   PCRep to indicates that requested PCE support the new enhanced BRPC
   procedure, and Inter-AS TE links from AS(i+1) to AS(i) satisfying the
   constraints have been included in PCRep.

   The following new flag of the RP object is defined:

   IVSPT Flag

            Bit Number    Name Flag
            -------       ------
            TBD           IVSPT

4.2.2.  BRPC Procedure Completion Failure

   If PCE(i) send IVSPT flag to PCE(i+1) who doesn't recognizes the
   IVSPT flag of RP object, PCE(i+1) MUST generate PCErr message with an
   Error-Type=4 (Not supported object), Error-value=4 (Unsupported
   parameter).  The PCE may include the parent object (RP object) up to
   and including (but no further than) the unknown or unsupported
   parameter.  In this case where the unknown or unsupported parameter
   is a bit flag (IVSPT flag), the included RP object should contain the
   whole bit flag field with all bits after the parameter at issue set
   to zero.  The corresponding path computation request is then
   cancelled by the PCE without further notification.

   If PCE(i) send IVSPT flag to PCE(i+1) who recognizes IVSPT flag of RP
   object but does not support the new BRPC procedure extended in this
   document, it MUST return a PCErr message to the upstream PCE with an
   Error-Type " Enhanced BRPC procedure unsupported".

   The PCErr message MUST be relayed to the requesting PCC.

   PCEP-ERROR objects are used to report a PCEP protocol error and are
   characterized by an Error-Type that specifies the type of error and
   an Error-value that provides additional information about the error
   type.  Both the Error-Type and the Error-value are managed by IANA.

   A new Error-Type is defined that relates to the BRPC procedure.

4.2.3.  Inter-AS TE links carried in PCEP message

   For the enhanced bidirectional Inter-AS TE LSP BRPC procedure
   referenced in this document, PCE(n) should select the unidirectional
   Inter-AS TE links that satisfy the constraints from all of the
   Inter-AS TE links that provide connectivity from domain (n) to
   domain(n-1),and then PCE(n) should return the selected Inter-AS TE
   links in PCRep message.

   Two methods of carrying Inter-AS TE links in PCRep are introduced in
   this document.  One is to introduce a new object (Inter-AS Virtual
   Shortest Path Tree -IVSPT) to carry Inter-AS TE links separately(see
   4.2.3.1.).  The other is to extend VSPT to include Inter-AS TE

   Each link of tree VSPT(i) represents the shortest constrained path
   between BN-en(j,i) and the TE LSP destination that satisfies the set
   of required constraints for the TE LSP (bandwidth, affinities,
   etc.).These are path segments to reach the TE LSP destination from
   BN-en(j,i).

   Note that PCE(i) only considers the entry BNs of domain(i), i.e.,
   only the BNs that provide connectivity from domain(i-1).

   Besides VSPT, this document defines Inter-AS Virtual Shortest Path
   Tree (IVSPT) used for describing unidirectional Inter-AS paths whose
   direction is from AS(i) to AS(i-1).

4.2.3.1.2.  Constrain Route Object(CRO)

   The CRO is used to encode the Inter-AS paths that satisfies the set
   of required constraints for the TE LSP.

   The CRO is carried within a PCRep message to provide the selected
   Inter-AS links if the path computation was successful.

   The contents of this object are identical to the contents of the
   RSVP-TE ERO defined in [RFC3209], [RFC3473], and [RFC3477].  That is,
   the object is constructed from a series of sub-objects.  Any RSVP-TE
   ERO sub-object already defined or that could be defined in the future
   for use in the RSVP-TE ERO is acceptable in this object.

4.2.3.1.3.  IVSPT Encoding

   The IVSPT is returned within a PCRep message.  The encoding consists
   of a non-ordered list of Constrain Route Objects (CROs) where each
   CRO represents an Inter-AS link that satisfy the required constraint
   from domain i to domain i+1.

           Example:

                   R1------R3----R5-----R7------R9-----R11---- R13
                           | \   | \     |     / |             /
                           |  \  |   \   |  ---- |  ----------
                           |   \ |     \ | /     | /
                   R2------R4----R6-----R8------R10----R12
                              :              :
                   <-- AS1 -->:<---- AS2 --->:<------- AS3 --------->

             Figure 5: An Example of Inter-AS path computation

   In the example shown in Figure 5, if we make the assumption that a
   constrained path exists between each ABR and the destination R13, the
   VSPT computed by a PCE(3) serving AS 3 consists of the following non-
   ordered set of EROs:

   o  ERO1: R9(TE Router ID)-R11(Interface IP address)-R13(TE Router ID)

   o  ERO2: R10(TE Router ID)-R13(TE Router ID)

   If we make the assumption that Inter-AS links R9-->R7 ,R9-->R8 and
   R10-->R8 satisfy the required constraints, the IVSPT selected by a
   PCE(3) serving AS 3 consists of the following non-ordered set of
   CROs:

   o  CRO1: R9(Interface IP address),R7(TE Router ID)

   o  CRO2: R9(Interface IP address),R8(TE Router ID)

   o  CRO3: R10(Interface IP address),R8(TE Router ID)

4.2.3.2.  Extend VSPT to include Inter-AS links

4.2.3.2.1.  New definition of VSPT(i)

   In each domain i:

   o  There is a set of X-en(i) entry BNs noted BN-en(k,i) where BN-
      en(k,i) is the kth entry BN of domain(i).

   o  There is a set of X-ex(i) exit BNs noted BN-ex(k,i) where BN-
      ex(k,i) is the kth exit BN of domain(i).

   For the bidirectional LSP computation, VSPT(i) may be extended as
   follows:

                 Root(TE LSP destination)
               /         |         |       \
              /          |   ...   |        \
      BN-en(1,i)...BN-en(1,i)... BN-en(j,i)...BN-en(j,i)
         |           |         |          |
    BN-ex(1,i-1)...BN-ex(k1,i-1) BN-ex(1,i-1)...BN-ex(kj,i-1)

    where:

    [X-en(i)] is the number of entry BNs in domain i and j<= [X-en(i)];

    [Y-ex(i-1)] is the number of exit BNs in domain i-1,
    kj is the number of exit BNs in domain i-1 that connect
    BN-en(j,i)(i.e., the jth entry BN in domain i),
    and k1,k2,...,kj <= [Y-ex(i-1)]

                              Figure 6: IVSPT

   IVSPT(i) includes links that represent the shortest constrained path
   between BN-en(j,i) and the TE LSP destination &#65292;and Inter-AS
   links that satisfie the set of required constraints for the TE LSP
   (bandwidth, affinities, etc.) from AS(i) to AS(i+1).  These are path
   segments to reach the TE LSP destination from BN-ex(j,i-1).

4.2.3.2.2.  VSPT Encoding

   In the example shown in Figure 5, if we make the assumption that a
   constrained path exists between each ABR and the destination
   R13(i.e.,R9-R11-R13 and R10-R13), and Inter-AS links R9-->R7 ,R9-->R8
   and R10-->R8 satisfy the required constraints, the VSPT computed for
   the bidirectional LSP by a PCE(3) serving AS 3 consists of the
   following non-ordered set of EROs:

   o  ERO1: R7(TE Router ID)-R9(Interface IP address)-R11(Interface IP
      address)-R13(TE Router ID)

   o  ERO2: R8(TE Router ID)-R9(Interface IP address)-R11(Interface IP
      address)-R13(TE Router ID)

   o  ERO3: R8(TE Router ID)-R10(Interface IP address)-R13(TE Router ID)

   For the unidirectional LSP computation , VSPT is the same as defined
