   Integrating ROHC with IPsec (ROHCoIPsec) offers the combined benefits
   of IP security services and efficient bandwidth utilization.  However, 
   extensions to the SPD and SAD are required in order to integrate ROHC 
   with IPsec.  This document describes the IPsec extensions required 
   to support ROHCoIPsec.
                        </t>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>
   Using IPsec ([IPSEC]) protection offers various security services for
   IP traffic.  However, these
   benefits come at the cost of additional packet headers, which
   increase packet overhead.  As described in [ROHCOIPSEC], Robust
   Header Compression (ROHC [ROHC]) can be used with IPsec to reduce the
   overhead associated with IPsec-protected packets.
                        </t>
			
			<t>
   IPsec-protected traffic is carried over Security
   Associations (SAs), whose parameters are negotiated on a case-by-case
   basis.  The Security Policy Database (SPD) specifies the services
   that are to be offered to IP datagrams, and the parameters associated
   with SAs that have been established are stored in the Security
   Association Database (SAD).  To integrate ROHC and IPsec,
   various extensions to the SPD and SAD that incorporate ROHC-relevant
   parameters are required.
                        </t>
			
			<t>
   In addition, three extensions to IPsec processing are
   required.  First, a mechanism for identifying ROHC packets must be
   defined.  Second, a mechanism is required to ensure the integrity of the 
   decompressed packet.  Finally, the order of the inbound and outbound 
   processing must be enumerated when nesting IP Compression (IPComp [IPCOMP]), ROHC, and IPsec processing. 
                        </t>
			
		</section>
		
		<section title="Extensions to IPsec Databases">
			<t>
   The following subsections specify extensions to the SPD and the SAD
   to support ROHCoIPsec.
			</t>
			<section title="Security Policy Database (SPD)">
			<t>
   In general, the SPD is responsible for specifying the security
   services that are offered to IP datagrams.  Entries in the SPD
   specify how to derive the corresponding values for SAD entries.  To
   support ROHC, the SPD must be extended to include per-channel ROHC
   parameters.  Together, the existing IPsec SPD parameters and the 
   ROHC parameters will dictate the services that are provided to 
   packets protected by IPsec.
			</t>
		
			<t>
   The fields contained within each SPD entry are defined in [IPSEC],
   Section 4.4.1.2.  To support ROHC, several processing info fields
   must be added to the SPD; these fields contain information regarding
   the ROHC profiles and channel parameters supported by the local ROHC
   instance.   
			</t>

			<t>
      The SPD specifies what services are to be offered to IP datagrams, 
      and in what fashion.  To offer IP datagrams compression services, 
      two per-channel configuration parameters are 
      added to the SPD. Specifically, the following two parameters must be 
      included if the processing info field in the SPD is set to PROTECT (suggested values for these parameters are consistent with [ROHCPPP]):
			</t>
			<t></t>
			<list style="empty">
				<t>
      MAX_CID: The highest context ID number to be used by the compressor.  
      MAX_CID must be at least 0 and at most 16383 (The value 0 implies having one context).  The suggested value for MAX_CID is 15.
				</t>
			</list>
			<t></t>
			<list style="empty">
				<t>
      PROFILES: This indicates the ROHC profiles supported by the
      decompressor.  The list of possible values this field may assume
      is defined in the [ROHCPROF] registry.
				</t>
			</list>
			<t></t>
                        <t>
   In addition to these ROHC channel parameters, a field within the SPD 
   is required to store a list of integrity algorithms supported 
   by the ROHCoIPsec instance:  
                        </t>
			<t></t>
			<list style="empty">
			<t>
	INTEGRITY ALGORITHM: a list of integrity algorithms supported
      by the ROHCoIPsec instance.  This will be used 
      by the ROHC process to ensure that packet headers are properly
      decompressed (see Section 3.2).
			</t>
			</list>
			<t>
Several other ROHC channel parameters are omitted from the SPD, 
because they are set implicitly.  The ROHC channel parameters are 
LARGE_CIDS, MRRU, and FEEDBACK_FOR.  
The LARGE_CIDS channel parameter is set implicitly, based on the 
value of MAX_CID (e.g. if MAX_CID is &lt;= 15, LARGE_CIDS is assumed to be 0).  
Furthermore, the MRRU parameter must be set to 0; 
since packets may be reordered across a ROHCoIPsec channel, a 
compression session must not use segmentation.  Finally, the ROHC FEEDBACK_FOR 
      channel parameter is set implicitly to the ROHC channel associated 
      with the SA in the reverse direction.  If an SA in the reverse 
      direction does not exist, ROHC must operate in the Unidirectional 
      Mode.  
 			</t>
			</section>
			
			<section title="Security Association Database (SAD)">
				<t>
   Each entry within the SAD defines the parameters associated with each
   established SA.  Unless if the "populate from packet" (PFP) flag is
   asserted for a particular field, SAD entries are determined by the
   corresponding SPD entries during the creation of the SA.
				</t>
			
				<t>
   The data items contained within the SAD are defined in [IPSEC],
   Section 4.4.2.1.  To support ROHC, this list of data items is
   augmented to include a "ROHC Data Item" field that defines the ROHC
   parameters.  These parameters (i.e., MAX_CID, PROFILES) are enumerated 
   above in Section 2.1.  In addition, the
   FEEDBACK_FOR parameter is also included, which is associated with the
   SA in the reverse direction (this data item does not need to be included
   in the SPD, since its value is implicitly derived).  Finally, two 
   additional parameters 
   are required to store the Integrity Algorithm and respective key that 
   is to be used to ensure that packets are properly decompressed 
   (see Section 3.2).  </t>

   <t>These "ROHC Data Item" values
   may be initialized manually (i.e., administratively configured for
   manual SAs), or initialized via a key exchange protocol (e.g.  IKEv2
   [IKEV2]) that has been extended to support the negotiation of ROHC
   parameters [IKEV2EXT].</t>
			</section>

		<section title="Extensions to IPsec Processing">
			<section title="Addition to the IANA Protocol Numbers Registry">
				<t>
   In order to demultiplex header-compressed from uncompressed traffic
   on a ROHC-enabled SA, a "ROHC" value must be reserved in the IANA
   Protocol Numbers registry.  If an outbound packet has a compressed
   header, the Next Header field of the security protocol header (e.g.,
   AH [AH], ESP [ESP]) must be set to the "ROHC" protocol identifier.  If
   the packet header has not been compressed, the Next Header field
   remains unaltered.  Conversely, for an inbound packet, the value of
   the security protocol Next Header field is checked to determine if
   the packet includes a ROHC header.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Verifying the Integrity of Decompressed Packet Headers">
				<t>
   Since ROHC is inherently a lossy algorithm, ROHCoIPsec may use an additional Integrity Algorithm (and respective
   key) to compute a second Integrity Check Value (ICV) for the
   uncompressed packet.  This ICV is computed over the uncompressed IP header, as well at the higher-layer headers and the packet payload, and is appended to the ROHC-compressed packet.  At the decompressor, the
   decompressed packet (including the uncompressed IP header, higher-layer headers, and packet payload; but not including the authentication data) will be used with the Integrity Algorithm (and
   its respective key) to compute a value that will be compared to the
   ICV.  If these values are not identical, the decompressed packet must
   be dropped by the decompressor.
				</t>

   <t>Figure 1 illustrates the composition of a ROHCoIPsec-processed IPv4 packet.  In the example, TCP/IP compression is applied, and the packet is processed with tunnel mode ESP.</t>

				<section title="ICV Computation and Integrity Verification">
					<t>
In order to correctly verify the integrity of the decompressed packets, the processing steps for ROHCoIPsec must be implemented in a specific order, as given below.
					</t>
					<t>For outbound packets that are to be processed by ROHC:
						<list style="symbols">
							<t>
An ICV is computed for the uncompressed packet via ROHCoIPsec's Integrity Algorithm (and respective key)
							</t>
							<t>
The packet header(s) is(are) compressed by the ROHC process
							</t>
							<t>
The ICV is appended to the end of the compressed packet
							</t>
							<t>
The security protocol is applied to the packet
							</t>
						</list>
					</t>
					<t>For inbound packets that are to be decompressed by ROHC:
						<list style="symbols">
							<t>
A packet received on a ROHC-enabled SA is IPsec-processed
							</t>
							<t>
The packet header(s) is(are) decompressed by the ROHC process
							</t>
							<t>
The decompressed packet is used with the Integrity Algorithm (and its respective key) to compute a value that is compared to the ICV (if these two values differ, the packet is dropped)
							</t>
						</list>
					</t>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section title="Nested IPComp and ROHCoIPsec Processing">
				<t>
   IPComp ([IPCOMP]) is another mechanism that can be implemented to
   reduce the size of an IP datagram.  If IPComp and ROHCoIPsec are
   implemented in a nested fashion, the order of the outbound and
   inbound processing steps must be carefully enumerated.
				</t>
				<t>
For outbound packets that are to be processed by IPcomp and ROHC:
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>
The ICV is computed for the uncompressed packet, and the appropriate ROHC compression profile is applied to the packet
						</t>
						<t>
IPComp is applied, and the packet is sent to the IPsec process
						</t>
						<t>
The security protocol is applied to the packet
						</t>
					</list>
				</t>
				<t>
Conversely, for inbound packets that are to be both ROHC- and IPcomp-decompressed:
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>
A packet received on a ROHC-enabled SA is IPsec-processed
						</t>
						<t>
The datagram is decompressed based on the appropriate IPComp algorithm
						</t>
						<t>
The packet is sent to the ROHC module for header decompression and integrity verification
						</t>
					</list>
				</t>
			</section>
		</section>
		
		<section title="Security Considerations">
			<t>
   A ROHCoIPsec implementer should consider the strength of protection 
   provided by the integrity check algorithm used to verify the valid 
   decompression of ROHC-compressed packets.  Failure to implement a 
   strong integrity check algorithm increases the probability of an 
   invalidly decompressed packet to be forwarded by a ROHCoIPsec device 
   into a protected domain.  In general, if an integrity check algorithm 
   is used with IPsec, it is recommended that the integrity check 
   algorithm used by ROHC is at least the same strength.
			</t>
			<t>
   The implementation of ROHCoIPsec may increase the susceptibility for traffic
   flow analysis, where an attacker can
   identify new traffic flows by monitoring the relative size of the
   encrypted packets (i.e. a group of "long" packets, followed by a long
   series of "short" packets may indicate a new flow for some ROHCoIPsec
   implementations).  To mitigate this concern, ROHC padding mechanisms
   may be used to arbitrarily add padding to transmitted packets to
   randomize packet sizes.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="IANA Considerations">
			<t>
   IANA is requested to allocate one value within the "Protocol Numbers"
   registry [PROTOCOL] for "ROHC".  This value will be used to indicate
   that the next level protocol header is a ROHC header.
