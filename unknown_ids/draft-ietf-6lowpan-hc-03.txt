Abstract

   This document specifies an IPv6 header compression format for IPv6
   packet delivery in 6LoWPAN networks.  The compression format relies
   on shared context to allow compression of arbitrary prefixes.  This
   document specifies compression of multicast addresses and a framework
   for compressing next headers.  This framework specifies UDP
   compression and is prepared for additional transports.

Internet-Draft    6LoWPAN Compression of IPv6 Datagrams    November 2008


1.  Introduction

   The [IEEE 802.15.4] standard specifies an MTU of 128 bytes, yielding
   about 80 octets of actual MAC payload once security is turned on, on
   a wireless link with a link throughput of 250 kbps or less.  The
   6LoWPAN adaptation format [RFC4944] was specified to carry IPv6
   datagrams over such constrained links, taking into account limited
   bandwidth, memory, or energy resources that are expected in
   applications such as wireless Sensor Networks.  [RFC4944] defines a
   Mesh Addressing header to support sub-IP forwarding, a Fragmentation
   header to support the IPv6 minimum MTU requirement [RFC2460], and
   stateless header compression for IPv6 datagrams (LOWPAN_HC1 and
   LOWPAN_HC2) to reduce the relatively large IPv6 and UDP headers down
   to (in the best case) several bytes.

   LOWPAN_HC1 and LOWPAN_HC2 are insufficient for most practical uses of
   6LoWPAN networks.  LOWPAN_HC1 is most effective for link-local
   unicast communication, where IPv6 addresses carry the link-local
   prefix and an Interface Identifier (IID) directly derived from IEEE
   802.15.4 addresses.  In this case, both addresses may be completely
   elided.  However, though link local addresses are commonly used for
   local protocol interactions such as IPv6 ND [RFC4861], DHCPv6
   [RFC3315] or routing protocols, they are usually not used for
   application layer data traffic, so the actual value of this
   compression mechanism is limited.

   Routable addresses must be used when communicating with devices
   external to the LoWPAN or in a route-over configuration where IP
   forwarding occurs within the LoWPAN.  For routable addresses,
   LOWPAN_HC1 requires both IPv6 source and destination addresses to
   carry the prefix in-line.  In cases where the Mesh Addressing header
   is not used, the IID of a routable address must be carried in-line.
   However, LOWPAN_HC1 requires 64-bits for the IID when carried in-line
   and cannot be shortened even when it is derived from the IEEE
   802.15.4 16-bit short address.

   When the destination is an IPv6 multicast address, LOWPAN_HC1
   requires the full 128-bit address to be carried in-line.  This
   specification provides an additional mechanism to compress Unique
   Local, Global and multicast IPv6 Addresses based on shared states
   within contexts.  It also introduces a number of additional
   improvements over [RFC4944].

   LOWPAN_HC1 cannot elide the IPv6 Hop Limit in the IPv6 header, even
   though a limited set of values are useful in many practical cases.
   For instance, if the LoWPAN is a mesh-under stub, a Hop Limit of 1
   for inbound and a default value such as 64 for outbound are usually
   enough for application layer data traffic.  Compressing that field

Internet-Draft    6LoWPAN Compression of IPv6 Datagrams    November 2008


   enables saving one octet per packet.

   LOWPAN_HC1 can be extended to include a LOWPAN_HC2 octet to support
   compression of UDP, TCP, or ICMPv6; that LOWPAN_HC2 octet is placed
   right after the LOWPAN_HC1 octet and before the uncompressed IP
   fields.  This specification moves the transport control octet after
   the uncompressed IP fields for a more properly layered structure.

   [RFC4944] defines a compression mechanism for UDP, but that mechanism
   does not enable checksum compression when rendered possible by
   additional upper layer mechanisms such as upper layer Message
   Integrity Check (MIC).  This specification adds the capability to
   compress the UDP checksum over the LoWPAN, which enables to save an
   additional pair of octets.

   Finally, LOWPAN_HC1 lacks the flexibility to support the compression
   of additional transport mechanisms that could be introduced in the
   future.

   This document specifies a header compression format for IPv6
   datagrams.  This format improves on the header compression format
   defined in [RFC4944] by generalizing it to support a broader range of
   communication paradigms, including both mesh-under and route-over
   configurations; communication to nodes internal and external to the
   6LoWPAN network; and multicast communication.  This document also
   defines a flexible framework for compressing arbitrary next headers
   and defines UDP header compression within this framework.  This
   compression format carries forward the design concepts in RFC 4944
   [RFC4944], minimizing any state and relying on shared context among
   all nodes in a 6LoWPAN network.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  IPv6 Header Compression

   In this section, we define the LOWPAN_IPHC encoding format for
   compressing the IPv6 header.  To enable effective compression
   LOWPAN_IPHC relies on information pertaining to the entire 6LoWPAN
   network.  LOWPAN_IPHC assumes the following will be the common case
   for 6LoWPAN communication: Version is 6; Traffic Class and Flow Label
   are both zero; Payload Length can be inferred from lower layers from
   either the 6LoWPAN Fragmentation header or the IEEE 802.15.4 header;
   Hop Limit will be set to a well-known value by the source; addresses

   assigned to 6LoWPAN interfaces will be formed using the link-local
   prefix or a single routable prefix assigned to the entire 6LoWPAN
   network; addresses assigned to 6LoWPAN interfaces are formed with an
   IID derived directly from either the 64-bit extended or 16-bit short
   IEEE 802.15.4 addresses.

      +-------------------------------------+------------------------


                       Figure 1: LOWPAN_IPHC Header

   The LOWPAN_IPHC encoding utilizes 11 bits, 3 of which are taken from
   the rightmost bit of the dispatch type.  The encoding may be extended
   by another octet to support additional contexts.  Uncompressed IPv6
   header fields follow the LOWPAN_IPHC encoding, as shown in Figure 1.
   With the above scenario, the LOWPAN_IPHC can compress the IPv6 header
   down to two octets (the dispatch octet and the LOWPAN_IPHC encoding)
   with link-local communication.  When routing over multiple IP hops,
   LOWPAN_IPHC can compress the IPv6 header down to 7 octets (1-octet
   dispatch, 1-octet LOWPAN_IPHC, 1-octet Hop Limit, 2-octet Source
   Address, and 2-octet Destination Address).

   contexts.  How the contexts are shared and maintained is out of
   scope.  Actions in response to unknown and/or invalid contexts are
   out of scope.

   If the CMF field is set to '01' in the LOWPAN_HC encoding, then an
   additional octet extends the LOWPAN_HC encoding following the DAM
   bits but before the IPv6 header fields that are carried in-line.  The
   additional octet identifies the prefix when the IPv6 source and/or
   destination address is compressed.  The context identifier is 4 bits
   for each address, supporting up to 16 contexts.  The encoding is
   shown in Figure 3.

   SAC: Source Address Context  Identifies the prefix that is used when
      the IPv6 source address is compressed.
   DAC: Destination Address Context  Identifies the prefix that is used
      when the IPv6 destination address is compressed.

2.2.  IPv6 Header Encoding

   Fields carried in-line (in part or in whole) appear in the same order
   as they do in the IPv6 header format [RFC2460].  The Version field is
   always elided.  Unicast IPv6 addresses may be compressed to 64 or 16
   bits or completely elided.  Multicast IPv6 addresses may be
   compressed to 8, 16, or 24 bits.  The IPv6 Payload Length field MUST
   always be elided and inferred from lower layers using the 6LoWPAN
   Fragmentation header or the IEEE 802.15.4 header.

2.2.1.  Traffic Class and Flow Label Compression

   The TF field in the LOWPAN_HC encoding indicate whether the Traffic
   Class and Flow Label are carried in-line in the compressed IPv6
   header.  When Flow Label is included while the Traffic Class is
   compressed, an additional 4 bits are included to maintain byte-
   alignment.  Two of the 4 bits contain the ECN bits from the Traffic
   Class field.

   To ensure that the ECN bits appear in the same location for all
   encodings that include them, the Traffic Class field is rotated right
   by 2 bits in the compressed IPv6 header.  The encodings are shown
   below:

2.2.2.  Stateless Multicast Addresses Compression

   LOWPAN_HC supports stateless compression of multicast address when M
   = 1 and SAC = 0.  An IPv6 multicast address may be compressed down to
   48, 32, 16, or 8 bits using stateless compression.  The format
   supports compression of the Solicited-Node Multicast Address (FF02::
   1:FFXX:XXXX) as well as any IPv6 multicast address where the upper
   bits of the multicast group identifier are zero.  The compressed
   forms only carry the least-significant bits of the multicast group
   identifier.  All compressed forms carry the multicast scope in-line
   and all (except DAM=10) carry the multicast flags as well.

2.2.3.  Stateful Multicast Addresses Compression

   LOWPAN_HC supports stateful compression of multicast addresses when M
   = 1 and SAC = 1.  This document currently defines SAM = 01: context-
   based compression of Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast Addresses
   [RFC3306][RFC3956].  In particular, the Prefix Length and Network
   Prefix can be taken from a context.  As a result, LOWPAN_HC can
   compress a Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast Address down to 6
   octets by only carrying the 4-bit Flags, 4-bit Scope, 8-bit RIID, and

     DAM = 01. Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast Address Compression

   Note that the Reserved field MUST carry the reserved bits from the
   multicast address format as described in [RFC3306].  When a
   Rendezvous Point is encoded in the multicast address as described in
   [RFC3956], the Reserved field carries the RIID bits in-line.


3.  IPv6 Next Header Compression

   LOWPAN_IPHC elides the IPv6 Next Header field when the NH bit is set
   to 1.  It also indicates the use of 6LoWPAN next header compression,
   LOWPAN_NHC.  The value of IPv6 Next Header is recovered from the
   first bits in the LOWPAN_NHC encoding.  The following bits are
   specific to the IPv6 Next Header value.  Figure 4 shows the structure
   of an IPv6 datagram compressed using LOWPAN_IPHC and LOWPAN_NHC.


   +-------------+-------------+-------------+-----------------+--------
   | LOWPAN_IPHC | In-line     | LOWPAN_NHC  | In-line Next    | Payload
   |   Encoding  |   IP Fields |   Encoding  |   Header Fields |
   +-------------+-------------+-------------+-----------------+--------


       Figure 4: Typical LOWPAN_IPHC/LOWPAN_NHC Header Configuration

3.1.  LOWPAN_NHC Format

   Compression formats for different next headers are identified by a
   variable length bit-pattern immediately following the LOWPAN_IPHC
   compressed header.  When defining a next header compression format,
   the number of bits used SHOULD be determined by the perceived
   frequency of using that format.  However, the number of bits and any
   remaining encoding bits SHOULD respect octet alignment.  The
   following bits are specific to the next header compression format.
   In this document, we define a compression format for UDP headers.

3.2.  UDP Header Compression

   This document defines a compression format for UDP headers using
   LOWPAN_NHC.  The UDP compression format is shown in Figure 6.  Bits 0
   through 4 represent the NHC ID and '11110' indicates the specific UDP
   header compression encoding defined in this section.

                       Figure 6: UDP Header Encoding

   C: Checksum:
      0: All 16 bits of Checksum are carried in-line.  The Checksum MUST
         be included if there are no other end-to-end integrity checks
         that are stronger than what is provided by the UDP checksum.
         Such an integrity check MUST be end-to-end and cover the IPv6
         pseudo-header, UDP header, and UDP payload.
      1: All 16 bits of Checksum are elided.  The Checksum is recovered
         by recomputing it.

   P: Ports:
      00:  All 16 bits for both Source Port and Destination Port are
         carried in-line.
      01:  All 16 bits for Source Port are carried in-line.  First 8
         bits of Destination Port is 0xF0 and elided.  The remaining 8
         bits of Destination Port are carried in-line.
      10:  First 8 bits of Source Port are 0xF0 and elided.  The
         remaining 8 bits of Source Port are carried in-line.  All 16
         bits for Destination Port are carried in-line.
      11:  First 12 bits of both Source Port and Destination Port are
         0xF0B and elided.  The remaining 4 bits for each are carried
         in-line.

   Fields carried in-line (in part or in whole) appear in the same order
   as they do in the IPv6 header format [RFC2460].  IPv6 addresses may
   be compressed to 64 or 16 bits or completely elided.  The UDP Length

   field MUST always be elided and is inferred from lower layers using
   the 6LoWPAN Fragmentation header or the IEEE 802.15.4 header.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new IPv6 header compression format for
   6LoWPAN networks.  The document allocates Dispatch type values of
   0x08-0x0F (TBD) for LOWPAN_IPHC.


5.  Security Considerations

   The definition of LOWPAN_IPHC permits the compression of header
   information on communication that could take place in its absence,
   albeit in a less efficient form.  It recognizes that a IEEE 802.15.4
   PAN may have associated with it a number of prefixes through shared
   context.  How the shared context is assigned and managed is beyond
   the scope of this document.

   Werb for useful feedback and discussion.


7.  Changes

   Draft 03:
      - Decoupled meaning of SAM bits from the destination address.
      - Have separate bit to indicate multicast address compression.
      - More extensive support for multicast address compression,
      including Unicast-Prefix-based Multicast Addresses.

   Draft 02:
      - Updated wording with compression mode to clarify that a
      compression mode does not enforce what kind of destination address
      is being used.  Specifically changed Destination Dependent Field
      to Compression Mode.
      - Specify that the configuration and management of contexts is out
      of scope of this document.

   Draft 01:

      - HC back to 1 byte by default by stealing a few bits from the
      dispatch field.
      - Added better support for multicast address compression.
      - Fixed alignment for UDP port compression.
      - Better support for Traffic Class and Flow Label compression.
      - Pascal joined as an author.
