1.  Introduction

   The canonical link relation specifies the preferred version of a URI
   from a set of identical or vastly similar content that may be
   accessible on multiple URIs.  This designation is a helpful hint to
   automated programs, such as search engines, for displaying the
   desired URI in search results as well as consolidating indexing
   properties, such as link popularity, from the duplicate URIs to the
   canonical version.

   The most common application of the canonical link relation includes
   specifying the preferred version of a URI from duplicate content
   pages created with the addition of parameters (e.g. session IDs,
   tracking IDs, category, or sort information).

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  The Canonical Link Relation

   The canonical (target URI) MUST contain content that duplicates, is
   extremely similar, or is a superset of the content in the context
   (referring) URI.  Presence of the canonical link relation indicates
   to applications, such as search engines, that they MAY:

   o  Index content only from the canonical target (i.e. content from
      the context URIs will be likely disregarded as duplicative).

   o  Consolidate URI properties, such as link popularity, to the
      canonical.

   o  Display the canonical target as the representative URI.

   A resource SHOULD NOT specify more than one canonical link relation.

   The value of the target/canonical URI MAY:

   o  Be self-referential (context URI identical to target URI)

   o  Specify a relative or absolute URI

   o  Exist on a different hostname or domain

   o  Exist on a different protocol: http to https, or vice versa

   o  Be a superset of the content of the context URI

      *  For example, "page1" of a multi-page article may specify the
         canonical target as the "view-all" URI because "view-all" is a
         superset of page1's content.  However, "page2" should not
         designate "page1" as the canonical as the content of page1 is
         not inclusive of page2.

   o  Be the source URI of a 302, 303, or 307 redirect (Sections 10.3.3,
      10.3.4, and 10.3.8, respectively, of [RFC2616]).

   The value of the target/canonical URI SHOULD NOT designate:

   o  The source URI of a "300 Multiple Choices" URI (Section 10.3.1 of
      [RFC2616]) or a permanent redirect (Section 10.3.2 of [RFC2616]).

   o  A URI that specifies a canonical link relation to a URI other than
      itself.

   o  A URI that serves a 4xx error code (Section 10.4 of [RFC2616]).

   o  The first page of a multi-page article or multi-page listing of
      items (since the first page is not a duplicate or a superset or
      the context URI).  For example, page2 and page3 of an article
      should not specify page1 as the canonical.

4.  Examples

   The following example illustrates:

   o  Three URIs that serve nearly the exact same content.

   o  One URI which is the canonical or "preferred version".

   o  Two URIs with additional query parameters, making them the non-
      preferred version of the content (duplicates).  The canonical link
      relation is therefore specified on these duplicates.

   If the preferred version of a URI and its content exists at:

     http://www.example.com/page.php?item=purse

   Then duplicate content URIs such as:

     http://www.example.com/page.php?item=purse&category=bags


     http://www.example.com/page.php?item=purse&category=bags&sid=1234

   may designate the canonical link relation in HTML as specified in
   [RFC5988]:

     <link rel="canonical"
           href="http://www.example.com/page.php?item=purse" />

   or alternatively, in the HTTP Header as specified in Section 5 of
   [RFC5988]:

     Link: <http://www.example.com/page.php?item=purse>; rel="canonical"

   This signals to automated programs, such as search engines, that
   these are duplicates of the canonical URI:
   http://www.example.com/page.php?item=purse.

   Automated programs may then select the canonical value as the display
   URI (such as in search results), and additional URI properties such
   as indexing and ranking signals, can be transferred as well.

5.  Recommendations

   Before implementing the canonical link relation, verification of the
   following is recommended:

   1.  The content of the context URI is identical, extremely similar,
       or a subset of the canonical.

   2.  Permanent HTTP redirects (Section 10.3.2 of [RFC2616]), the
       traditional strong indicator that a URI's content has been
       permanently moved, could not be implemented in place of the
       canonical link relation.

   3.  In the case where the canonical target is a superset of content
       from the context URI (e.g. page1 or page2 to view-all), that the
       user experience is strongly taken into consideration, both in
       regard to possible increased load time and potential complexity
       in navigation.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the Canonical Link Relation below as per
   [RFC5988].

   Relation Name:

      CANONICAL

   Description:

      Designates the preferred version of a resource (the URI and its
      contents).

   Reference:

      This specification.

   Notes:

      None.

   Application Data:

      None.

7.  Security Considerations

   When a site is compromised, the canonical link relation can be
   implemented with malicious intent to designate the hacker's URI as
   the preferred version of the content.  While this technique is
   largely unnoticeable to humans, automated programs may cluster the
   compromised resource as duplicative of the hacker's designated
   canonical, transferring properties such as link popularity away from
   the resource to the hacker's URI.

8.  Internationalisation Considerations

   In designating a canonical URI, please see [RFC3986] for information
   on URI encoding.
