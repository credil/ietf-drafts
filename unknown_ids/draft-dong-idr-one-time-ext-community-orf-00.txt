Abstract  

   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for 
   BGP, termed "One-time Extended Community Outbound Route Filter", 
   which would allow a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a route 
   refresh request with a set of extended-community-based filters to 
   make the peer re-advertise only the specific routes matching the 
   filters to the speaker. This ORF-type enables a BGP speaker to 
   refresh some specific routes without requiring its peer to re-
   advertise the whole Adj-RIB-Out, which makes the route refresh 
   operation more efficient and reduces the impact on network stability. 
   This filter does not change the outbound route filters on BGP peers 
   and should only be used for one-time filtering.

1. Introduction 

   The Outbound Route Filtering Capability defined in [RFC5291] 
   provides a mechanism for a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a set 
   of Outbound Route Filters (ORFs) that can be used by its peer to 
   filter its outbound routing updates to the speaker.

   During some network operations, BGP speaker only needs to retrieve 
   some routes with specific extended communities from its peer, but 
   sending plain ROUTE-REFRESH will lead to the peer re-advertising its 
   whole Adj-RIB-Out. Such large amounts of updates include a lot of 
   unnecessary routes which would result in waste of processing 
   resources and bandwidth. With the increase of IPv6 deployment, this 
   problem could be more significant. Even configured with ORF 
   mechanism as defined in [RFC5291], on receipt of a ROUTE-REFRESH 
   message, the peer will re-advertise all the routes matching current 
   outbound route filters, i.e., the whole Adj-Rib-Out for this BGP 
   speaker. Since in this case the BGP speaker does not want to change 
   the outbound route filters on its peer, this requirement cannot be 
   met by current ORF mechanism.  

   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for 
   BGP, termed "One-time Extended Community Outbound Route Filter", 
   which would allow a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a route 
   refresh request with a set of Extended Community based filters to 
   make the peer re-advertise only the specific routes matching the 
   filters to the speaker. This ORF-type enables a BGP speaker to 
   retrieve routes with specific Extended Communities without requiring 
   its peer to re-advertise the whole Adj-RIB-Out, which makes such 
   route refresh operation more efficient and also reduces the impact 
   on network stability. This filter does not change the outbound route 
   filters on BGP peers and should only be used for one-time filtering. 

   One use case of one-time Extended Community ORF would be to refresh 
   routes with specific Route Target (RT) Extended Community. For 
   example, on receipt of routes with specific RTs, according to local 
   policies some attributes of the routes may be changed, or some 
   routes may be discarded. When later such local policies are changed 
   or removed, the routes impacted by such policies need to be 
   refreshed and processed according to the new local policies. With 
   the whole Adj-RIB-Out route refresh it would result in a lot of 
   unnecessary routes being re-advertised, and this would be a waste of 
   the processing resource and bandwidth. In this case, one-time 
   Extended Community ORF would be quite useful to request only routes 
   matching specific RTs to be re-advertised. 

2. One-time Extended Community ORF-Type 

   This document defines a new ORF type: One-time Extended Community 
   ORF. Value of this ORF-Type is to be assigned by IANA. 

   In the following description, the sending speaker sends a one-time

   ORF request and the receiving speaker receives it and sends back the   
   routes to satisfy the request. 

   As specified in the [RFC5291], an ORF entry is a tuple of the form 
   <AFI/SAFI, ORF-Type, Action, Match, ORF-value> an ORF consists of 
   one or more ORF entries that have a common AFI/SAFI and ORF-Type. An 
   ORF is identified by <AFI/SAFI, ORF-Type>. 

   The type-specific part consists of a single Extended Community 
   encoded as an eight-octets field.  

   Since the semantics of this new ORF-Type is "one-time filtering" and 
   has no impact on existing ORFs, the Action field is irrelevant and 
   MUST be ignored on receipt. 

   The MATCH field of the One-time Extended Community ORF SHOULD be set 
   to PERMIT on the sender and SHOULD be ignored on the receiver. This 
   is the same as defined in Extended-Community ORF [EXT-COMM-ORF]. 

   The ORF entries of this type would only be used as one-time filters 
   that MUST not change any previously installed ORF entry on the 
   receiving speaker. 

3. Operation 

   The capability negotiation of <AFI/SAFI, One-time Extended Community 
   ORF> MUST NOT delay the advertisement of routes with this AFI/SAFI. 

   The received One-time Extended Community ORF entries SHOULD only be 
   used for one-time route filtering and MUST NOT be saved locally. The 
   received One-time Extended Community ORF entries MUST NOT modify the 
   outbound route filters on the receiving speaker (either locally 
   configured or received from the sending speaker through ORF). 

   On receipt of ROUTE-REFRESH message with One-time Extended Community 
   ORF entries, the receiving speaker SHOULD re-advertise to the 
   sending speaker the routes from the Adj-RIB-Out associated with the 
   sending speaker which pass the entries carried in the One-time 
   Extended Community ORF as well as the locally saved ORFs (if any) 
   received from the sending speaker. 

   Since different processing orders may lead to different results, the 
   One-time ORFs and the regular ORFs SHOULD not be encoded in one 
   route-refresh message.

Internet-Draft  One-time Extended Community Based ORF       March 2011 
    

   During the period when the receiving speaker is sending updates to 
   satisfy the One-time ORF request, it may experience other routing   
   activity that will require it to send updates unrelated to the One-
   time ORF request. It is permitted to send these updates before it 
   has completed sending the One-time ORF related updates. 

   Similarly, if a route that passes the One-time ORF has already   
   been sent and the receiving speaker experiences routing activity   
   that changes this route and the receiving speaker has not yet sent 
   all routes to satisfy the One-time ORF request, it is permitted to 
   send the changed route immediately. 

   Details about how to interoperate when both One-time ORF Capability 
   and the Enhanced Route Refresh Capability as described in [Enhanced-
   Refresh] are enabled will be discussed in the next version. 

4. Security Considerations 

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues 
   in [RFC4271]. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   This document specifies a new Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) type, 
   One-time Extended Community ORF. The value of the ORF-type needs to 
   be assigned by IANA.
