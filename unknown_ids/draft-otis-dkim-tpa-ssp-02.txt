Abstract

   TPA-SSP (DKIM Third-Party Authorization for Sender Signing Practices)
   is a DNS-based label prefix mechanism for authorizing Third-Party
   domains.  This mechanism allows a first-party domain to autonomously
   authorize a range of third-party domains in a scalable, individual
   DNS transaction.  This authorization can extend the scope of DKIM-SSP
   policy assertions and eliminate more difficult to administer
   mechanisms.  Alternatives for facilitating third-party authorizations
   currently necessitate coordination between two domains by setting up

   selector/key DNS records, DNS zone delegations, or the regular
   exchange of public/private keys.

   Checking Sender Signing Practices occurs when a From header email-
   address is not within the domain of a valid DKIM signature.  When a
   Third-Party signature is found, TPA-SSP offers an efficient means for
   the email address domain within the From header to specifically
   authorize other third-party signing domains.  The scope of the
   authorization may also assert identity authentication for Sender and
   Resent-* headers for email-addresses within the signing domain.
   Identity authentication within the From header domain may be asserted
   by the scope of the authorization, even when signed by a Third-Party
   domain.  In addition, the RFC2821.MailFrom domain can authorize
   domains for controlling DSNs.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes how any email-address domain publishing SSP
   records defined in [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] can also specifically
   autonomously authorize [RFC4871] signing by third-party domains.
   Recommended or suggested actions for a DKIM receiver are not
   included, and are considered "out-of-scope" for this document.  The
   receiver is assumed to better understand their environment's impact
   upon the performance of DKIM signatures and how results are utilized
   within their domain.

   TPA-SSP records permit signing domains that are not at or above the
   From header email-address domain to comply with Sender Signing
   Practices.  TPA-SSP authorized domains are to be considered
   equivalent to the authorizing domain for applying Sender Signing
   Practices.  This mechanism eliminates a complex coordination of
   selector/key DNS records, DNS delegation, or exchanges of public/
   private keys between two domains otherwise required to facilitate
   desired authorizations.

   Trust is an essential requisite before DKIM signature header field's
   'i=' semantics or the TPA-SSP "-i" suffix scope assertions provide
   valuable advisory information.  Advisory information regarding
   identity authentication enables safer message annotations that ensure
   trusted identities are recognized.  TPA-SSP assertions also convey
   which third-party domains are authoritative for asserting which
   identifiers are to be considered to have been authenticated.  This
   information is essential for the proper recognition of trusted
   identities, as well as noting when a message source may require added
   scrutiny.


2.  Envelope Authorizations

   DKIM is fully independent of the SMTP Client and the
   [RFC2821].MailFrom email-address.  Allowing the [RFC2821].MailFrom
   email-address to authorize signing domains and assert signing
   practices may prevent Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs) from being
   sent when the signing domain is not authorized and a "strict" TPA-SSP
   practice is being asserted.  Conversely, this may also ensure DSNs
   are not dropped when the signing domain does happen to be authorized
   or is not precluded.  The application of TPA-SSP at the MailFrom
   represents an entirely optional strategy which may or may not prove
   either effective or practical.  The MailFrom scope is offered only
   for experimentation.

3.  Evaluating Signing Domains

   Regulatory agencies are unable to control Internet abuse by
   curtailing access.  Unlike IPv4 addresses, there is virtually no
   limit on the number of domain-names available.  Registrar pricing of
   domain-names need to remain uniform.  Otherwise, fees based upon the
   intrinsic value of a name could cause name holders to become
   extortion targets.  High initial costs for domain-names are also
   unlikely to represent a deterrent, largely due to high levels of
   payment fraud.  Driven by market forces, registrars offer free
   sampling of domain names (domain tasting) to create some revenue from
   a few purchased domains.  However, this unfortunate practice also
   resulted in a daily churn of millions of domain names.  Distributing
   domain name reputation to curb abuse has been made more expensive,
   slower, and less effective as a result.

   In addition, DKIM can not directly identify the domain transmitting
   the message, and can not prevent abusive message replay.  Abusive
   message replay may prove indistinguishable from bulk mailings of
   various types.  Since abuse may not be controlled by the signing
   domain, message acceptance will likely remain largely dependent upon
   the reputation of the SMTP client's IP address.  Abuse reporting
   facilitated by DKIM signatures should therefore first select signing
   domains that correspond with domains administering the SMTP Client
   publicly transmitting the message.

   A domain evaluation process will confront many domains with unknown
   reputations.  New domains are constantly being introduced where
   registrars are unable to prevent bad actors from controlling either a
   new or previously held domain name.  When the receiver seeks to
   protect a DKIM verification process with a preliminary filter,
   acquiring SSP records or DKIM keys may inadvertently leak valuable
   information that benefits bad actors.  Processing all DKIM signatures
   may also inundate a receiver's limited resources.  As a result,
   validating DKIM signatures and obtaining TPA-SSP resource records may
   need to be limited to known trustworthy domains.  Signatures
   authorized by domains with good reputations provide a means to safely
   extend limited verification resources.


4.  Authorization Scope

   An Authorization effort without TPA-SSP will likely involve sharing
   details between the email provider, the domain owner, and the DNS
   provider.  Since there are many ways in which authorizations can be
   accomplished, it is unlikely there will be consistent or standardized
   formats for exchanging the necessary information.  In addition, in
   the case of security breaches, the wrong party might be held



Otis                      Expires May 21, 2008                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                   TPA-SSP                   November 2007


   accountable for content never seen nor logged by them.  The TPA-SSP
   authorization scheme clarifies who signed the message and on who's
   behalf, while permitting greater control by the authorizing domain.

   TPA-SSP records replace domain delegation, selector/key record
   mirroring, or key exchanges.  A significant amount of detail is
   associated with selector/key records.  These details include user
   limitations, suitable services, key resource record's Time-To-Live,
   revocation and update procedures, and whether the DKIM Signature
   header field's 'i=' semantics are applied to indicate authenticated
   email-addresses.  The TPA-SSP records allow authorizing domains the
   ability to limit the scope of the authorizations and authentications.

   When a signing domain differs from that of a domain within the From
   header email-address, TPA-SSP records can safely extend compliance
   with SSP where actions of only the email-address domain are required.
   In addition, just as a DKIM signature can assert an email-address has
   been authenticated via the "i" construct, a signing domain that only
   signs authenticated email-addresses can be denoted by the "-i" suffix
   on the scope assertion within the corresponding TPA-SSP record.  When
   obtained using the "tpa-label", a returned scope with an "-i" suffix
   indicates that the domain plays the role of assuring that email-
   addresses identities have been authenticated.  This assertion remains
   valid even when signing domains and the From email-address domains
   differ.

   Without the "-i" suffix on the scope assertion within the TPA-SSP
   record, the domain is designated as providing only acceptable
   signatures.  The same would be true for a DKIM signature lacking the
   "i" parameter.  While offering only valid signatures will not ensure
   all possible spoofing is prevented, messages signed in this manner
   should also not receive annotations indicating authenticated
   identities either.

   Choosing not to implement identity authentication may represent an
   economical means to administer domains employing DKIM signatures.
   Authorizing domains to play the role of only providing acceptable
   signatures may be suitable for non-critical messages, where the goal
   might be to improve delivery acceptance.


5.  TPA-SSP Assertions

   Syntax descriptions use the form described in Augmented BNF for
   Syntax Specifications [RFC4234].  The "base32" function is defined in
   [RFC4648] and the "sha-1" hash function is defined in
   [FIPS.180-2.2002].  The TPA-SSP records follow the tag-value syntax
   described in section 4.3 of [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] and section 3.2 of

   [RFC4871].  Unrecognized tags and tags with illegal values MUST be
   ignored.  In the ABNF below, the FWS token is inherited from
   [RFC2822] with the exclusion of obs-FWS.  The ALPHA and DIGIT tokens
   are imported from [RFC4234].  The function "lcase" converts upper-
   case ALPHA characters to lower-case.  The function "sha-1" returns a
   hash in base32 base-char set.  The terminating period is not included
   in domain-name conversions.  The tags used in TPA-SSP records are as
   follows:

     asterisk = %x2A ; "*"
     dash = %x2D ; "-"
     dot = %x2E ; "."
     underscore = %x5F ; "_"
     ANY = asterisk dot ; "*."
     dns-char = ALPHA / DIGIT / dash
     id-prefix = ALPHA / DIGIT
     label = id-prefix [*61dns-char id-prefix]
     sldn = label dot label
     base-char = (dns-char / underscore)
     domain = *(label dot) sldn
            ; not to exceed 238 characters
            ; excluding "_ssp._domainkey."
     tpa-label = base32( sha-1( lcase(signing-domain)))
               ; 32 base-char characters

   The receiver obtains the TPA-SSP email-address domain practices using
   a DNS query for an IN class TXT resource record.  The tpa-label is
   created by processing the domain found within the signature's "d="
   parameter (does not include the trailing period).  This tpa-label is
   then placed below the "._ssp.domainkey.<email-address domain>" and
   used to access the TPA-SSP TXT records.  Character-strings contained
   within the TXT resource record are concatenated into forming a single
   string.  A character-string is a single length octet followed by that
   number of characters treated as binary information.  A TPA-SSP record
   may be located at these domains:

      <tpa-label>._ssp._domainkey.<email-address domain>.



6.  Scope

   scope= Authorization Scope List (Optional).  This tag defines a list
   of scoping assertions for various email-address locations within the
   message.

      scope = "F" / "F-i" / "O" / "O-i" / "M" / "M-i" / "NO-TPA"
      as-list = "scope" [FWS] "=" [FWS] scope 0*([FWS] ":" [FWS] scope)

6.1.  From Originator Header Field

   The "F" or "F-i" scope asserts that messages carrying the email-
   address domain within the From header field are authorized to be
   signed by the tpa listed domain.  When the "-i" suffix is included,
   it can be assumed identities for the scoped header have been
   authenticated.


6.2.  MailFrom Parameter

   This "M" or "M-i" scope asserts that messages carrying the email-
   address domain within the MailFrom parameter are authorized to be
   signed by the authorized domain.  When the "-i" suffix is included,
   it can be assumed identities for the MailFrom have been
   authenticated.


6.3.  Other than From Originating Header Fields

   The "O" or "O-i" scope asserts that messages carrying the email-
   address domain within the Sender or Resent-* header fields are
   authorized to be signed by the authorized domain.  When the "-i"
   suffix is included, it can be assumed identities for the scoped

   header have been authenticated.


6.4.  NO-TPA

   The "NO-TPA" scope asserts that domain does not publish TPA-SSP
   records.



7.  Authorized Signing Domain

   tpa= Authorized Signing Domain list (Optional).  This tag repeats all
   or portions of the domain encoded within the tpa-label.  This option
   ensures proper handling of possible hash collisions.  When a domain
   is prefixed with the "*."  ANY label, then all subdomains of this
   domain are to be considered included within the list.

      ad = [ANY] domain
      ad-list = "tpa" [FWS] "=" [FWS] ad 0*([FWS] ":" [FWS] ad)




8.  Modification to Sender Signing Practices Check Procedures

   Section 4.4 step 9 is modified.  Step 9 becomes:

      When one or more valid Third-Party Signatures are present in the
      message, and a scope tag exists, and the scope tag does not
      contain "NO-TPA" within the SSP record, then:
      *  When the "dkim" tag is "strict" and a TPA-SSP record within the
         From header domain has a scope tag of "F" or "F-i", then the
         message is to be considered signed by an Originator Acceptable
         Third-Party Signature.  When the scope tag within the TPA-SSP
         record is "F-i", the From email-address is to be considered
         authenticated by the Third-Party Domain.
      *  When the "dkim" tag is "all" and a TPA-SSP record within the
         From header domain has a scope tag of "O" or "O-i" and the
         email-address domain within the Sender, or Resent-* headers are
         within the signing domain, then the message is considered
         signed with an Originator Acceptable Third-Party Signature.
         When the scope tag within the TPA-SSP record is "O-i", then
         email-addresses within the third-party signing domain are
         considered to have been authenticated when included within the
         signature.
      *  When the "dkim" tag is "all" and no TPA-SSP record is found or
         published, and a valid Third-party signature is acceptable to

         the verifier, then the message is considered signed by a
         Verifier Acceptable Third-Party Signature.
      If an acceptable valid Third-Party Signature has been determined,
      the message is not Suspicious and the algorithm terminates.


9.  IANA Considerations

   Unless a registry is established for SSP record tags, there are no
   IANA requirements in this draft.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC and no request is desired or registration is not considered
   practical.


10.  Security Considerations

   This draft extends signing policies related to [RFC4871].  Security
   considerations in the Sender Signing Practices are mostly related to
   attempts on the part of malicious senders to represent themselves as
   other senders, often in an attempt to defraud either the recipient or
   the Alleged Originator.  Additional security considerations regarding
   Sender Signing Practices may be found in the DKIM threat analysis
   [RFC4686].

   The use of the SHA-1 hash algorithm does not represent a security
   concern.  The hash simply ensures a deterministic domain-name size is
   achieved.  Unexpected collisions can be detected and handled by using
   the extended TPA-SSP "tpa=" option.
