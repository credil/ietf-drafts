                        SPPP Over SOAP and HTTP
                  draft-ietf-drinks-sppp-over-soap-05

Abstract

   The Session Peering Provisioning Protocol (SPPP) is an XML protocol
   that exists to enable the provisioning of session establishment data
   into Session Data Registries or SIP Service Provider data stores.
   Sending XML data structures over Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
   and HTTP(s) is a widely used, de-facto standard for messaging between
   elements of provisioning systems.  Therefore the combination of SOAP
   and HTTP(s) as a transport for SPPP is a natural fit.  The obvious
   benefits include leveraging existing industry expertise, leveraging
   existing standards, and a higher probability that existing
   provisioning systems can be more easily integrated with this
   protocol.  This document describes the specification for transporting
   SPPP XML structures over SOAP and HTTP(s).

1.  Introduction

   SPPP, defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-drinks-spprov], is best supported by
   a transport and messaging infrastructure that is connection oriented,
   request-response oriented, easily secured, supports propagation
   through firewalls in a standard fashion, and that is easily
   integrated into back-office systems.  This is due to the fact that
   the client side of SPPP is likely to be integrated with
   organizations' operational support systems that facilitate
   transactional provisioning of user addresses and their associated
   session establishment data.  While the server side of SPPP is likely
   to reside in a separate organization's network, resulting the SPPP
   provisioning transactions traversing the Internet as they are
   propagated from the SPPP client to the SPPP server.  Given the
   current state of industry practice and technologies, SOAP and HTTP(s)
   are well suited for this type of environment.  This document
   describes the specification for transporting SPPP XML structures over
   SOAP and HTTP(s).

   The specification in this document for transporting SPPP XML
   structures over SOAP and HTTP(s) is primarily comprised of five
   subjects: (1) a description of any applicable SOAP features, (2) any
   applicable HTTP features, (3) security considerations, and perhaps
   most importantly, (5) the Web Services Description Language (WSDL)
   definition for SPPP over SOAP.

3.  SOAP Features and SPPP

   The list of SOAP features that are explicitly used and required for
   SPPP are limited.  Most SOAP features are not necessary for SPPP.
   SPPP primarily uses SOAP simply as a standard message envelope
   technology.  The SOAP message envelope is comprised of the SOAP
   header and body.  As described in the SOAP specifications, the SOAP
   header can contain optional, application specific, information about
   the message.  The SOAP body contains the SPPP message itself, whose
   structure is defined by the combination of one of the WSDL operations
   defined in this document and the SPPP XML data structures defined in
   the SPPP protocol document.  SPPP does not rely on any data elements
   in the SOAP header.  All relevant data elements are defined in the
   SPPP XML schema described in [I-D.draft-ietf-drinks-spprov] and the
   SPPP WSDL specification described in this document.

   WSDL is a widely standardized and adopted technology for defining the
   top-level structures of the messages that are transported within the
   body of a SOAP message.  The WSDL definition for the SPPP SOAP
   messages is defined later in this document, which imports by
   reference the XML data types contained in the SPPP schema.  The IANA
   registry where the SPPP schema resides is described in The IETF XML
   Registry [RFC3688].

   There are multiple structural styles that SOAP WSDL allows.  But the
   best practice for this type of application is what is sometimes
   referred to as the Document Literal Wrapped style of designing SOAP
   WSDL.  This style is generally regarded as an optimal approach that
   enhances maintainability, comprehension, portability, and, to a
   certain extent, performance.  It is characterized by setting the
   soapAction binding style as _document_, the soapAction encoding style
   as _literal_, and then defining the SOAP messages to simply contain a
   single data element that _wraps_ that is a data structure containing
   all the required input or output data elements.  The figure below
   illustrates this high level technical structure.

          Figure 1: Technical Structure of the SPPP SOAP Messages

   The SOAP operations supported by SPPP are normatively defined later
   in this document.  Each SOAP operation defines a request/input
   message and a response/output message.  Each such request and
   response message then contains a single object that wraps the SPPP
   XML data types that comprise the inputs and the outputs,
   respectively, of the SOAP operation.

   SOAP faults are not used by the SPPP SOAP mapping.  All SPPP success
   and error responses are specified within the SPPP protocol
   specification [I-D.draft-ietf-drinks-spprov].  However, if a SOAP
   fault were to occur, perhaps due to failures in the SOAP message
   handling layer of a SOAP library, the client application should
   capture and handle the fault.  Specifics on how to handle such SOAP
   faults, if they should occur, will be specific to the chosen SOAP
   implementation.

   SOAP 1.2 [SOAPREF] or higher and WSDL 1.1 [WSDLREF] or higher SHOULD

4.  HTTP(s) Features and SPPP

   SOAP is not tied to HTTP(s), however, for reasons described in the
   introduction, HTTP(s) is a good choice as the transport mechanism for
   the SPPP SOAP messages.  HTTP 1.1 includes the "persistent
   connection" feature, which allows multiple HTTP request/response
   pairs to be transported across a single HTTP connection.  This is an
   important performance optimization feature, particularly when the
   connections is an HTTPS connection where the relatively time
   consuming SSL handshake has occurred.  Persistent connections SHOULD
   be used for the SPPP HTTP connections.

   HTTP 1.1 [RFC2616] or higher SHOULD be used.

5.  Authentication and Session Management

   To achieve integrity and privacy, conforming SPPP SOAP Clients and
   Servers MUST support SOAP over HTTP over TLS [RFC5246] as the secure
   transport mechanism.  This combination of HTTP and TLS is referred to
   as HTTPS.  And to accomplish authentication, conforming SOAP SPPP
   Clients and Servers MUST use HTTP Digest Authentication as defined in
   [RFC2617].  As a result, the communication session is established
   through the initial HTTP connection setup, the digest authentication,
   and the TLS handshake.  When the HTTP connection is broken down, the
   communication session ends.

6.  SPPP SOAP WSDL Definition

   The SPPP WSDL is defined below.  The WSDL design approach is commonly
   referred to as _Generic WSDL_.  It is generic in the sense that there
   is not a specific WSDL operation defined for each object type that is
   supported by the SPPP protocol.  There is a single WSDL update
   operation called submitUpdateRqst, and a single WSDL query operation
   called submitQueryRqst.  The submitUpdateRqst operation takes as
   input an spppUpdateRequestMsg object and returns as output an
   spppUpdateResponseMsg object.  These objects _wrap_ the
   spppUpdateRequest and spppUpdateResponse objects respectively.  These
   two object data structures are described in the SPPP protocol
   specification [I-D.draft-ietf-drinks-spprov].  And finally, the
   spppSOAPBinding in the WSDL defines the binding style as _document_
   and the encoding as _literal_.  It is this combination of _wrapped_
   input and output data structures, _document_ binding style, and
   _literal_ encoding that characterize the Document Literal Wrapped
   style of WSDL specifications.

   The advantage of generic WSDL is that the WSDL is more succinct, much
   simpler, and therfore more easily maintained.  As new types of
   protocol objects and actions are added into or removed from the SPPP
   protocol, the WSDL does not need to change.  This approach is made
   possible by the fact that the SPP XML data types and supported
   actions are defined in the SPPP XML schema, not in the WSDL.  As a
   result the supported actions do not need to be re-defined here inside
   the SPPP SOAP WSDL.

   Note: The following WSDL has been formatted (e.g., tabs, spaces) to
   meet I-D requirements.

7.  SPPP SOAP Examples

   This section provides a few examples of SPPP SOAP messages.  This
   section of course relies on the XML data structures defined in the
   SPPP protocol specification [I-D.draft-ietf-drinks-spprov].  So refer
   to that document to understand XML object types embedded in these
   example messages.

   Note: The following examples have been formatted (e.g., tabs, spaces)

8.  Security Considerations

   SPPP is used to query and update session peering data and addresses,
   so the ability to access this protocol should be limited to users and
   systems that are authorized to query and update this data.  Because
   this data is sent in both directions, it may not be sufficient for
   just the client or user to be authenticated with the server.  The
   identity of the server should also be authenticated by the client,
   which is often accomplished using the TLS certificate exchange and
   validation described in [RFC2818].  SPPP data may include sensitive
   information, routing data, lists of resolvable addresses, etc.  So
   when used in a production setting and across non-secure networks,
   SPPP should only be used over communications channels that provide
   strong encryption for data privacy.

8.1.  Integrity, Privacy, and Authentication

   The SPPP SOAP binding relies on an underlying secure transport for
   integrity and privacy.  Such transports are expected to include TLS/
   HTTPS.  In addition to the application level authentication imposed
   by an SPPP server, there are a number of options for authentication
   within the transport layer and the messaging envelope.  These include
   TLS client certificates, HTTP Digest Access Authentication, and
   digital signatures within SOAP headers.

   At a miniumum, all conforming SPPP over SOAP implementations MUST
   support HTTPS.

8.2.  Vulnerabilities

   The above protocols may have various vulnerabilities, and these may
   be inherited by SPPP over SOAP.  And SPPP itself may have
   vulnerabilities because an authorization model is not explicitly
   specified in the current specification.

   It is important that SPPP implementations implement an authorization
   model that considers the source of each SPPP query or update request
   and determines whether it is reasonable to authorize that source to
   perform that specific query or update.

8.3.  Deployment Environment Specifics

   Some deployments of SPPP over SOAP could choose to use transports
   without encryption.  This presents vulnerabilities but could be
   selected for deployments involving closed networks or debugging
   scenarios.  However, the vulnerabilities of such a deployment could
   be a lack of integrity and privacy of the data transported over SPPP
   messages in this type of deployment.
