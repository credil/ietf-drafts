Internet-Draft                   RTC-Web                     August 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document presents a few use-case of web applications that are
   executed in a browser and use real-time communication capabilities.
   Based on the use-cases, the document derives requirements related to
   the browser and the API used by web applications in the browser.

   The document focuses on requirements related to real-time media
   streams.  Requirements related to privacy, signalling between the
   browser and web server etc are currently not considered.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions

   TBD


4.  Use-cases

4.1.  Introduction

   This section describes web based real-time communication use-cases,
   from which requirements are later derived.

4.2.  Browser-to-browser use-cases

4.2.1.  Simple Video Communication Service

4.2.1.1.  Description

   In the service the users have loaded, and logged into, a video
   communication web application into their browsers, provided by the
   same service provider.  The web service publishes information about
   user login status, by pushing updates to the web application in the
   browsers.  By selecting an online peer user, a 1-1 video
   communication session between the browsers of the peers is initiated.
   The invited user might accept or reject the session.

   When the session has been established, a self-view, as well as the
   video sent from the remote peer, are displayed.  The users can change

   the sizes of the video displays during the session.  The users can
   also pause sending of media (audio, video, or both), and mute
   incoming media.

   Any session participant can end the session at any time.

   The users are using communication devices of different makes, with
   different Operating Systems and Browsers from different vendors.

   One user has an unreliable internet connection.  It sometimes has
   packet losses, and is sometimes goes down completely.

   One user is located behind a Network Address Translator (NAT).

4.2.1.2.  Derived Requirements

   F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F8, F9, F10, F22, F25

   A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13

4.2.2.  Simple Video Communication Service, NAT/FW that blocks UDP

4.2.2.1.  Description

   This use case is almost identical to the previos one.  The difference
   is that one of the users is behind a NAT that blocks UDP traffic.

4.2.2.2.  Derived Requirements

   F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F8, F9, F10, F22, F23, F25, F26

   A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13

4.2.3.  Simple Video Communication Service, access change

4.2.3.1.  Description

   This use case is almost identical to "4.2.1 Simple Video
   Communication Service".  The difference is that the user changes
   network access during the session:

   The communication device used byt one of the users have several
   network adapters (Ethernet, WiFi, Cellular).  The communication
   device is access the internet using Ethernet, but the user has to
   start a trip during the session.  The communication device
   automatically changes to use WiFi when the ethernet cable is removed
   and then moves to cellular access to the internet when moving out of
   WiFi coverage.  The session continues even though the access method

   A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13

4.2.4.  Simple Video Communication Service, QoS

4.2.4.1.  Description

   This use case is almost identical to the previos one.  The use of QoS
   capabilities is added:

   The user in the previous use case that starts a trip is behind a
   common residential router that supports prioritization of traffic.
   In addition, the user's provider of cellular access has QoS support
   enabled.  The user is able to take advantage of the QoS support both
   when accessing via the residential router and when using cellular.

4.2.4.2.  Derived Requirements

   F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F8, F9, F10, F21, F22, F23, F25

   A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13

4.2.5.  Simple video communication service with inter-operator calling

4.2.5.1.  Description

   Two users have logged into two different web applications, provided
   by different service providers.

   The service providers are interconnected by some means, but exchange
   no more information about the users than what can be carried using
   SIP.

   NOTE: More profiling of what this means may be needed.

   Each web service publishes information about user login status for
   users that have a relationship with the other user; how this is
   established is out of scope.

   The same functionality as in the "4.2.1 Simple Video Communication
   Service" is available.

   The same issues with connectivity apply.

4.2.6.  Hockey Game Viewer

4.2.6.1.  Description

   An ice-hockey club uses an application that enables talent scouts to,
   in real-time, show and discuss games and players with the club
   manager.  The talent scouts use a mobile phone with two cameras, one
   front-facing and one rear facing.

   The club manager uses a desktop for viewing the game and discussing
   with the talent scout.  The video stream captured by the front facing
   camera (that is capturing the game) of the mobile phone is shown in a
   big window on the desktop screen, while a thumbnail of the rear
   facing camera is overlaid.

   Most of the mobile phone screen is covered by a self view of the
   front facing camera.  A thumbnail of the rear facing cameras view is
   overlaid.

4.2.7.  Multiparty video communication

4.2.7.1.  Description

   In this use case the simple video communication service is extended
   by allowing multiparty sessions.  No central server is involved - the
   browser of each participant sends and receives streams to and from
   all other session participants.  The web application in the browser
   of each user is responsible for setting up streams to all receivers.

   The audio sent by each participant is a mono stream.  However, in
   order to enhance intelligibility, the web application pans the audio
   from different participants differently when rendering the audio.
   This is done automatically, but users can change how the different
   participants are placed in the (virtual) room.

   Each video stream received is by default displayed in a thumbnail

   frame within the browser, but users can change the display size.

   Note: What this uses case adds in terms of requirements is
   capabilities to send streams to and receive streams from several
   peers concurrently, as well as the capabilities to render the video
   from all recevied streams and be able to spatialize and mix the audio
   from all received streams locally in the browser.

4.2.8.  Multiparty on-line game with voice communication

4.2.8.1.  Description

   In this use-case, the voice part of the multiparty video
   communication application is used in the context of an on-line game.
   The received voice audio media is rendered together with game sound
   objects.  For example, the sound of a tank moving from left to right
   over the screen must be rendered and played to the user together with
   the voice media.

   Quick updates of the game state is required.

   Note: the difference regarding local audio processing compared to the
   "Multiparty video communication" use case is that other sound objects
   than the streams must be possible to be included in the
   spatialization and mixing.  "Other sound objects" could for example a
   file with the sound of the tank, that file could be stored locally or
   remotely.

4.2.9.  Distributed Music Band

4.2.9.1.  Description

   In this use-case, a music band is playing music while the members are
   at different physical locations.  No central server is used, instead
   all streams are set up in a mesh fashion.

   Discussion: This use case was briefly discussed at the Quebec webrtc
   meeting and it got support.  So far the only concrete requirement
   (A17) derived is that the application must be able to ask the browser
   to treat the audio signal as audio (in contrast to speech).  However,
   the use case should be further analysed to determine other
   requirements (could be e.g. on delay mic->speaker, level control of
   audio signals, etc.).

4.3.  Browser - GW/Server use cases

4.3.1.  Telephony terminal

4.3.1.1.  Description

   A mobile telephony operator allows its customers to use a web browser
   to access their services.  After a simple log in the user can place
   and receive calls in the same way as when using a normal mobile
   phone.  When a call is received or placed, the identity will be shown
   in the same manner as when a mobile phone used.

   Alice uses her web browser with a service something like Skype to be
   able to phone PSTN numbers.  Alice calls 1-800-gofedex.  Alice should
   be able to hear the initial prompts from the fedex IVR and when the
   IVR says press 1, there should be a way for Alice to navigate the
   IVR.

4.3.3.  Video conferencing system with central server

4.3.3.1.  Description

   An organization uses a video communication system that supports the
   establishment of multiparty video sessions using a central conference
   server.

   The browsers of all participants send an audio stream (mono or stereo
   depending on the equipment of a participant) to the central server.
   The central server mixes the audio streams and sends towards the
   participants a mixed stereo audio stream.

   Each participant sends two video streams in a simulcast fashion
   towards the server, one low resolution and one high resolution.  At
   each participant one high resolution video is displayed in a large
   window, while a number of low resolution videos are displayed in
   smaller windows.  The server selects what video streams to be
   forwarded as main- and thumbnail videos, based on speech activity.
   As the video streams to display can change quite frequently (as the
   conversation flows) it is important that the delay from when a video
   stream is selected for display until the video can be displayed is
   short.

   The organization has an internal network set up with an aggressive
   firewall handling access to the internet.  If users can not
   physically access the internal network, they can establish a Virtual
   Private Network (VPN).

   It is essential that the communication can not be eavesdropped.

   All participant are authenticated by the central server, and
   authorized to connect to the central server.  The participants are
   identified to each other by the central server, and the participants
   do not have access to each others' credentials such as e-mail
   addresses or login IDs.

   Note: This use case adds requirements on support for fast stream
   switches F7, on encryption of media and on ability to traverse very
   restrictive FWs.  It also introduces simulcast, but no concrete
   requirement is put for this.

5.  Requirements

5.1.  General

   This section contains requirements, derived from the use-cases in
   section 4.

   NOTE: It is assumed that the user applications are executed on a
   browser.  Whether the capabilities to implement specific browser
   requirements are implemented by the browser application, or are
   provided to the browser application by the underlying Operating
   System (OS), is outside the scope of this document.

5.2.  Browser requirements

   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F5              The browser MUST be able to render good quality
                   audio and video even in presence of reasonable
                   levels of jitter and packet losses.

                   TBD: What is a reasonable level?
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F6              The browser MUST be able to handle high loss and
                   jitter levels in a graceful way.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F7              The browser MUST support fast stream switches.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F8              The browser MUST detect when a stream from a
                   peer is not received any more
   ----------------------------------------------------------------

7.1.  Introduction

   A malicious web application might use the browser to perform Denial
   Of Service (DOS) attacks on NAT infrastructure, or on peer devices.
   Also, a malicious web application might silently establish outgoing,
   and accept incoming, streams on an already established connection.

   Based on the identified security risks, this section will describe
   security considerations for the browser and web application.

7.2.  Browser Considerations

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms for getting user
   consent to use device resources such as camera and microphone.

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms for informing the user
   that device resources such as camera and microphone are in use
   ("hot").

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms for users to revise
   consent to use device resources such as camera and microphone.

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms in order to assure that
   streams are the ones the recipient intended to receive.

   The browser is needs to ensure that media is not sent, and that
   received media is not rendered, until the associated stream
   establishment and handshake procedures with the remote peer have been
   successfully finished.

   The browser needs to ensure that the stream negotiation procedures
   are not seen as Denial Of Service (DOS) by other entities.

7.3.  Web Application Considerations

   The web application is expected to ensure user consent in sending and
   receiving media streams.


8.  Additional use cases

   Several additional use cases have been discusses.  At this point
   these use cases are not included as requirement deriving use cases
   for different reasons (lack of documentation, overlap with existing
   use cases, lack of consensus).  For completeness these additional use
   cases are listed below:
