Internet-Draft               Ogg Media Types                  April 2008


1.  Introduction

   This memo describes media types for Ogg, a data encapsulation format
   defined by the Xiph.Org Foundation.  Refer to "Introduction" in
   [RFC3533] and "Overview" in [Ogg] for background information on this
   container format.

   Binary data contained in Ogg, such as Vorbis and Theora, has
   historically been interchanged using the application/ogg media type
   as defined by [RFC3534].  This document obsoletes [RFC3534] and
   defines three media types for different types of content in Ogg to
   reflect this usage in the IANA media type registry, to foster
   interoperability by defining underspecified aspects, and to provide
   general security considerations.

   The Ogg container format is known to contain [Theora] or [Dirac]
   video, [Speex] (narrow-band and wide-band speech), [Vorbis] or [FLAC]
   audio, and [CMML] timed text/metadata.  As Ogg encapsulates binary
   data, it is possible to include any other type of video, audio,
   image, text or, generally speaking, any time-continuously sampled
   data.

   While raw packets from these data sources may be used directly by
   transport mechanisms that provide their own framing and packet-
   separation mechanisms (such as UDP datagrams or RTP), Ogg is a
   solution for stream based storage (such as files) and transport (such
   as TCP streams or pipes).  The media types defined in this document
   are needed to correctly identify such content when it is served over
   HTTP, included in multi-part documents, or used in other places where
   media types [RFC2045] are used.

2.  Conformance and Document Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.
   Requirements apply to all implementations unless otherwise stated.

   An implementation is a software module that supports one of the media
   types defined in this document.  Software modules may support
   multiple media types, but conformance is considered individually for
   each type.

   Implementations that fail to satisfy one or more "MUST" requirements
   are considered non-compliant.  Implementations that satisfy all
   "MUST" requirements, but fail to satisfy one or more "SHOULD"
   requirements, are said to be "conditionally compliant".  All other

Internet-Draft               Ogg Media Types                  April 2008


   implementations are "unconditionally compliant".

3.  Deployed Media Types and Compatibility

   The application/ogg media type has been used in an ad-hoc fashion to
   label and exchange multimedia content in Ogg containers.

   Use of the "application" top-level type for this kind of content is
   known to be problematic, in particular since it obfuscates video and
   audio content.  This document thus defines the media types,
   o  video/ogg
   o  audio/ogg

   which are intended for common use and SHOULD be used when dealing
   with video or audio content respectively.  This document also
   obsoletes the [RFC3534] definition of application/ogg and marks it
   for complex data (e.g. multitrack visual, audio, textual and other
   time-continuously sampled data), which is not clearly video or audio
   data and thus not suited for either the video/ogg or audio/ogg types.
   Refer to the following section for more details.

   An Ogg bitstream generally consists of one or more logical bitstreams
   that each consist of a series of header and data pages packetising
   time-continuous binary data [RFC3533].  The content types of the
   logical bitstreams may be identified without decoding the header
   pages of the logical bitstreams through use of a [Skeleton]
   bitstream.  Using Ogg Skeleton is REQUIRED for content served under
   the application/ogg type and RECOMMENDED for video/ogg and audio/ogg,
   as it is a type of identifier space used to describe the different
   encapsulated data.

   Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations that identify a
   logical bitstream which they cannot decode SHOULD ignore it, while
   continuing to decode the ones they can.  Such precaution ensures
   backward and forward compatibility with existing and future data.

   Ongoing work related to this registration may introduce optional
   parameters in future revisions of this document.  One example area of
   effort may introduce a parameter that would allow for data in use
   within the media type to be asserted and determined without
   examination of the bitstream.  Implementations MUST consider the
   impact of such an update.

4.  Relation Between the Media Types

   As stated in the previous section, this document describes three
   media types which are targeted at different data encapsulated in Ogg.
   Since Ogg is capable of encapsulate any kind of data, the multiple



Goncalves, et al.       Expires October 10, 2008                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               Ogg Media Types                  April 2008


   usage scenarios have revealed interoperability issues between
   implementations when dealing with content served solely under the
   application/ogg type.

   While this document does redefine the earlier definition of
   application/ogg, this media type will continue to embrace the widest
   net possible of content with the video/ogg and audio/ogg types being
   smaller subsets of it.  However, the video/ogg and audio/ogg types
   take precedence in a subset of the usages, specifically when serving
   multimedia content that is not complex enough to warrant the use of
   application/ogg.  Following this line of thought, the audio/ogg type
   is an even smaller subset within video/ogg, as it is not intended to
   refer to visual content.

   As such, the application/ogg type is the recommended choice to serve
   content aimed at scientific and other applications that require
   various multiplexed signals or streams of continuous data.  For
   bitstreams containing visual, timed text, or any other type of
   material that requires a visual interface, but which is not complex
   enough to warrant serving under application/ogg, the video/ogg type
   is recommended.  In situations where the Ogg bitstream predominantly
   contains audio data, it is recommended to use the audio/ogg type.

5.  Encoding Considerations

   Binary: The content consists of an unrestricted sequence of octets.

   Note:
   o  Ogg encapsulated content is binary data and should be transmitted
      in a suitable encoding without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit stripping,
      etc.; base64 [RFC4648] is generally preferred for binary-to-text
      encoding.
   o  Media types described in this document are used for stream based
      storage (such as files) and transport (such as TCP streams or
      pipes); separate types are used for real-time transfer, such as
      for the RTP payload formats of Theora [ThRTP] video, and Vorbis
      [VoRTP] or Speex [SpRTP] audio, as well as for identification of
      the encapsulated data within Ogg.

6.  Security Considerations

   Refer to [RFC3552] for a discussion of terminology used in this
   section.

   The Ogg encapsulation format is a container and only a carrier of
   content (such as audio, video, and displayable text data) with a very
   rigid definition.  This format in itself is not more vulnerable than
   any other content framing mechanism.



Goncalves, et al.       Expires October 10, 2008                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               Ogg Media Types                  April 2008


   Ogg does not provide for any generic encryption or signing of itself
   or its contained bitstreams.  However, it encapsulates any kind of
   binary content and is thus able to contain encrypted and signed
   content data.  It is also possible to add an external security
   mechanism that encrypts or signs an Ogg bitstream and thus provides
   content confidentiality and authenticity.

   As Ogg encapsulates binary data, it is possible to include executable
   content in an Ogg bitstream.  Implementations SHOULD NOT execute such
   content without prior validation of its origin by the end-user.  This
   may be an issue with applications that use Ogg for streaming or file
   transfer in a networking scenario.  An implementation decoding Ogg
   and its encapsulated data streams has to ensure correct handling of
   manipulated bitstreams, of buffer overflows, and similar issues.

   It is also possible to author malicious Ogg bitstreams, which attempt
   to call for an excessively large picture size, high sampling-rate
   audio, etc.  Implementations SHOULD protect themselves against this
   kind of attack.

   Ogg has an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically possible
   that metadata fields or media formats might be defined in the future
   which might be used to induce particular actions on the part of the
   recipient, thus presenting additional security risks.  However, this
   type of capability is currently not supported in the referenced
   specification.

   Implementations may fail to implement a specific security model or
   other means to prevent possibly dangerous operations.  Such failure
   might possibly be exploited to gain unauthorized access to a system
   or sensitive information; such failure constitutes an unknown factor
   and is thus considered out of the scope of this document.

7.  Interoperability Considerations

   The Ogg container format is device-, platform- and vendor-neutral and
   has proved to be widely implementable across different computing
   platforms through a wide range of encoders and decoders.  A broadly
   portable reference implementation [libogg] is available under the
   revised (3-clause) BSD license, which is a Free Software license.

   The Xiph.Org Foundation has defined the specification,
   interoperability, and conformance, and conducts regular
   interoperability testing.

8.  IANA Considerations

   In accordance with the procedures set forth in [RFC4288], this
   document registers two new media types and redefines the existing
   application/ogg as defined in the following section.

9.  Ogg Media Types

9.1.  application/ogg

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: ogg

   Restrictions on usage: The type application/ogg SHOULD only be used
   in situations where it is not appropriate to serve data under the
   video/ogg or audio/ogg types.  Data served under the application/ogg
   type SHOULD use the .ogx file extension and MUST contain an Ogg
   Skeleton logical bitstream to identify all other contained logical
   bitstreams.

   material that requires a visual interface.  It is intended for
   content not complex enough to warrant serving under "application/
   ogg"; for example, a combination of Theora video, Vorbis audio,
   Skeleton metadata, and CMML captioning.  Data served under the type
   "video/ogg" SHOULD contain an Ogg Skeleton logical bitstream.
   Implementations interacting with the type "video/ogg" SHOULD support
   multiplexed bitstreams.

   Ogg bitstream predominantly contains audio data.  Content served
   under the "audio/ogg" type SHOULD have an Ogg Skeleton logical
   bitstream if they use the .oga extension.  The .ogg and .spx file
   extensions are a specialization that require no Skeleton due to
   concerns of backwards-compatibility with existing implementations.
   Use of the .oga file extension is the preferred method of
   distributing audio data under the "audio/ogg" type.
