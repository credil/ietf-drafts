        <t> This document describes an extension to the OpenPGP Message Format   that allows a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) Media Type  (aka Intenet Media type) to be associated with the encoded content. By providing more information beyond the existing binary and text formats this extension and can enable the automated selection of an appropriate media viewer for the decoded content.  </t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>OpenPGP - This is a term for security software that uses PGP 5.x
as a basis, formalized in <xref target="RFC4880">RFC&nbsp;4880</xref>.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

</t>
</section>

   <section title="Literal Data packet">
<t>The OpenPGP <xref target="RFC4880">RFC&nbsp;4880</xref> currently specifies only a few formats for encoded content: text, binary and UTF-8. The format itself of the content is specified in section 5.9 as part of the Literal Data packet (Tag 11).  In addition to the body of the message being encoded, this packet also contains a one-octet field that describes how the data is formatted.</t>

<t>The current choices  are  'b' (0x62), in which case the Literal packet contains binary data and 't' (0x74) which describes text data and 'u' (0x75) for UTF-8 Data. </t>

<t>This field is followed by a file name as a string (one-octet length, followed by a file  name).  While not detailed in the RFC, most implementations of PGP also add a trailing null at the end of the file name but use the string length to skip to the next field. </t>

<t>We propose to add  a new  formatting type of 'm' (0x6d) to  describe that there is a <xref target="RFC2046">RFC&nbsp;2046</xref> MIME media type associated with the literal data.   In the case of a 'm' format type, the MIME media type is appended to the end of the null terminated file name,  while extending the  file name length byte to accommodate this additional information.</t>
</section> 

<section title="Example of literal packet taged with a MIME media type">
<t>The following is an  example of a Literal Data packet (Tag 11) that specifies the MIME media type format image/jpeg for a file named 'somedata.jpg'

  <section title="OpenPGP Implementation Considerations.">
<t>
OpenPGP implementations supporting the MIME literal data packet format SHOULD use the MIME media type string to select the appropriate viewer for the encoded content.  Implementations should consider the following possibilities:
<list style="symbols">
<t>As with the existing file name field, the string length can be zero bytes long, indicating that there is no file name or MIME media type specified. 
</t>
<t>There might be no null byte at the end of the file name, or no additional bytes specified in the file name string length, indicating that there is no MIME media type specified.
</t>
<t>
 The file string could have bytes specified but start with a null byte, this indicates that no file name is specified but that this is a MIME media type associated with the content.
</t>
<t>
The MIME media type MAY have an OPTIONAL null byte termination. Any data that follows such a null byte should be discarded and not considered part of the MIME media type. 
</t>
<t> 
 While the one-octet length of the file name field does limit the combined length of suggested file name and MIME media type, it does allow for some reasonable usage. In the case of combined length of suggested file name and MIME type string that exceeds 255 bytes, priority should be given to the MIME type string, and truncation of the filename is suggested. if such truncation should occur it is suggested that the file name extension be preserved.
</t>
 </list>
In the long run, a more correct method of associated MIME media type with content might employ one of the experimental tags mentioned in  <xref target="RFC4880">RFC&nbsp;4880</xref> section 13.10.

  <t>
The addition of a MIME type string increases the possibility of truncation of a large file name field in the Literal Packet.
</t>
<t>The addition of MIME type string after the file name string null termination does not  add any hidden channels that didn't potentially exist in the OpenPGP protocol.
</t>
<t>In order to prevent modification of the MIME type, encapsulating the Literal Data packet using the Symmetrically Encrypted Integrity Protected Data Packet (Tag 18) as specified in  OpenPGP <xref target="RFC4880">RFC&nbsp;4880</xref>   is highly recommended.
