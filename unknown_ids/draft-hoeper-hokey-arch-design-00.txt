1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) defined in [RFC3748] is
   an authentication framework that supports different types of
   authentication methods which are defined in EAP methods.  Originally
   designed for dial up connections, EAP is now commonly used for
   authentications in wireless access networks.  To allow faster re-
   authentications of previously authenticated peers, the EAP Re-
   authentication Protocol (ERP) was defined in [RFC5296].  ERP supports
   two forms of bootstrapping, i.e., "implicit bootstrapping" and
   "explicit bootstrapping".  Both forms of bootstrapping are used to
   derive EAP-based root keys for re-authentication and transport them
   to the local server that requested a root key for protecting re-
   authentication services to a peer.  Thus, ERP can be directly
   performed between a peer and the local server this peer is attached
   to without the need to communicate with the peer's home server in the
   home domain.

   [I-D.ietf-hokey-preauth-ps] defines EAP early authentication as the
   use of EAP by a mobile peer to establish authenticated keying
   material on a target attachment point prior to its arrival.  Here, a
   full EAP execution occurs before the handover of the peer takes
   place.  Hence, the goal of EAP early authentication is to complete
   complete all EAP related communication in prepartion for the Handover
   including AAA signaling before the mobile device moves.

   Both of these method-independent optimized authentication protocols
   enable fast inter-authenticator handovers.  However, currently it is
   unclear how the necessary handover infrastructure is deployed and can
   be integrated into existing EAP infrastructures.  In particular, it
   still needs to be defined where EAP re-authentication (ER) servers
   are placed in the network and how they can be integrated with the
   local as well as the home domain network to allow optmized
   communication overhead during handovers and better scalability.  This
   document focuses on providing deployment scenarios of HOKEY
   architecture and HOKEY architecture design in the wireless
   environment.  The design objectives for HOKEY architecture and main
   components of HOKEY architecture will be discussed, and examples of
   how ERP and early authentication can be integrated into HOKEY
   architecture will be taken into account.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Early Authentication Service

      Use of EAP by a mobile peer to establish authenticated keying
      material on a target attachment point prior to its arrival.

   Re-authentication Service

      Use of ERP by a mobile peer to make already existing keying
      material available to the target attachment point and use it for
      re-authentication during the handover.

   ER Server

      A logical entity that performs the server portion of ERP and may
      be co-located with an EAP or AAA server, see [RFC5296].

   HOKEY Service

      Re-authentication service provided by the ER server to the peer or
      early authentication service provided by the EAP server to the
      peer.

   HkSh Home HOKEY Service

      Re-authentication service provided by the home server with ERP
      support in the home domain to the peer.

   Hksv Visited HOKEY Service

      Re-authentication service provided by the local server with ERP
      support in the visited domain of the peer.


3.  Design Goals

   This section investigates the fundamental design goals for HOKEY
   architectures.  The general goals for HOKEY architecture design are
   to enhance the deployment scalability and lower the complexity of
   signaling overhead.

3.1.  Enhance deployment scalability

   Ideally, whenever a peer performs a handover, ERP can be executed
   between the peer and a local ER server, thus, reducing handover
   latency by avoiding a full EAP authentication with the peer's home
   EAP server.  In order for this to work, ERP bootstrapping must occur



Wu, et al.               Expires April 22, 2010                 [Page 4]

   before (implicit) or during (explicit) a handover.  Implicit
   bootstrapping requires the discovery of potential targets including,
   in case of inter-domain handovers, other local domain names.
   Explicit bootstrapping, on the other hand, requires the local ER
   server to contact the peer's home ER server.  Note that these
   discovery capabilities cannot be provided by EAP and typically depend
   on lower layer announcements.  Due to bootstrapping issues in inter-
   domain handovers, early authentication can be better suited for such
   handovers.  In order to enhance deployment scalability and
   flexibility, upon entering a new domain, early authentication or re-
   authentication via ERP should be coupled with implicit ERP
   bootstrapping to enable seamless transition from inter-domain
   handovers to intra-domain handovers.

3.2.  Lower communication overhead

   Full EAP exchanges or method specific re-authentication schemes (such
   as EAP-AKA's fast authentication) take at least two message round
   trips between a peer and its home EAP server.  In order to achieve
   low latency handovers, there is a need for a method-independent re-
   authentication protocol that completes in less than two round trips,
   e.g., ERP takes only one round trip to complete.  Ideally, no
   communication with the home EAP and ER servers should be necessary
   and instead a peer only communicates with a local servers.  The
   authentication and authorization needs interaction with a central
   authority (such as an AAA server) in a domain in most cases.  However
   the central authority may be placed far away from the mobile peer.
   In order to lower signaling exchange complexity, the communications
   with the central authority should be minimized as well.

                      Figure 1 System Overview


   The HOKEY architecture is structured as three main EAP-based
   components, i.e., EAP based handover key management, HOKEY
   authentication using handover key and HOKEY authorization.

   The EAP based handover key management is focused on EAP method
   independent key derivation and distribution and comprises the
   following functional elements:

   o  Handover key derivation

   o  Handover key distribution

   The HOKEY authentication is focused on the inter-authenticator
   handover or inter-technology handover and comprises the following
   functional elements:

   o  Full ERP authentication

   o  Local ERP authentication

   o  Early EAP Authentication

4.2.  EAP based handover Key Management

4.2.1.  Handover Key Derivation

   Keying material is derived from the EMSK for inter-authenticator
   handover usage.

4.2.2.  Handover Key Distribution

   The delivery of the EMSK child keys from the server holding the EMSK
   or a root key to another network server that requests a root key for
   providing protected services (such as re-authentication and other
   usage and domain-specific services) to EAP peers.  Handover key
   distributions support two forms of bootstrapping, implicit ERP
   bootstrapping and explicit ERP bootstrapping.  In both bootstrapping,
   the root key will be distributed from the home server to the local
   server.

4.3.  EAP Authentication

4.3.1.  Full ERP authentication

   It is full ERP exchange with the home ER server specified in the
   section 5.1 of [RFC5296].  The Local ER server should be present on
   the path of full ERP authentication and request DSRK from the home ER
   server.

4.3.2.  Local ERP authentication

   Local ERP authentication is specified in section 3.2.  It is ERP
   exchange with the local server without EAP method exchange.

4.3.3.  Early EAP authentication

   EAP Early authentication defined in the [I-D.ietf-hokey-preauth-ps].

4.4.  Local Domain Name Discovery

   Learn local domain name via the lower layer (e.g., L2 or L3
   announcement) or from the EAP-Initiate/ Re-auth-Start message.

5.  Deployment Scenarios

5.1.  Scenario 1: Home Network HOKEY Service

   In this scenario, the HOKEY peer and HOKEY Service are located in the
   home network.  We refer to this set of services provided by the HOKEY
   server as HkSh.  As shown in the figure 1, the HOKEY service can be
   located in the access network the HOKEY peer uses to connect to the
   home network, or it can be located elsewhere.

5.2.  Scenario 2: Visited network HOKEY Service

   In this scenario, the HOKEY peer is in the visited network and HOKEY
   services are provided by the visited network.  We refer to this as
   HkSv as shown in Figure 2.

   and all HOKEY services are provided by both the home network and the
   visited network, as shown in Figure 4.

   1.  Implicit bootstrapping occurs in the initial full EAP execution
       when a peer first attaches to one domain or enters into a new
       domain.  The bootstrapping is used to transport local root keys
       (e.g., DSRK) to the local ER server.

   2.  Suppose the serving NAS is aware of the local domain name of the
       target NAS, then local ERP can be used between the peer and the
       serving NAS to request this local domain name for the peer.  In
       this case, it is out of the scope of this document how the
       serving NAS knows the local domain names.

   3.  When the peer moves to the target NAS, the peer uses the local
       domain name received from the serving NAS to perform ERP with the
       local ER server without involvement of the home EAP server.

   1.  Explicit ERP bootstrapping occurs in the initial full
       authentication with the home ER server when the peer firstly
       attaches to one domain or enters into a new domain.  It is used
       to re-authenticate the peer in the home domain and transports the
       local root key to the local ER server.  Also it is used to
       request the local domain name for the peer.

   2.  When the peer associates with the target authenticator, ERP in
       the local domain is used to re-authenticate the peer in the local
       domain.

   1.  Implicit bootstrapping occurs in the initial full EAP execution
       when the peer first attaches to one domain or enters into a new
       domain and is used to transport local root key to the local ER
       server.

   2.  DHCP procedure is used to request local domain name for the peer
       and compute re-authentication root keys.

   3.  When the peer moves to the target NAS and knows the local domain
       name, the peer uses this information to perform ERP with the
       local ER server without involvement of the home EAP server.
