Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                 October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document describes how the existing in-network storage systems
   work and the related protocols in use, to evaluate their suitability
   for DECADE.

   The document is a work in progress, and will be updated to include
   technical details for the related work.


2.  Terminology and Concepts

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses terms defined in
   [I-D.song-decade-problem-statement].


3.  Existing In-network Storage Solutions

3.1.  P2P Cache

   P2P Caches are used to reduce the bandwidth problem of ISP.  For
   transparent cache, it has the following features:

   o  Allows P2P content to be cached and supplied locally such that
      network traffic is reduced.

   o  Cache is required to support P2P protocols.

   o  Use of Deep Packet Inspection means no discovery needed by
      application.

   Non-transparent P2P cache has the following features:

   o  Allows P2P content to be cached and supplied locally such that
      network traffic is reduced.

   o  Cache is required to support P2P protocols.

   o  Cache pretends to be normal peers.

   However, both transparent and non-transparent P2P caches have the
   following drawbacks that make it not suitable for DECADE:

   o  Doesn't provide resource control (bandwidth and connections).

   o  Does not provide a standard protocol for accessing storage.

3.2.  Web Cache

   Web cache is deployed between web servers and clients to save copies
   of server responses for future reuse to reduce latency and network
   traffic.  A related protocol for P2P applications to use web cache is
   HTPT.  It proposes to share chunks of P2P files/streams using HTTP
   protocol with cache-control headers.

   Web caches have the following drawbacks pertaining to usage in
   DECADE:

   o  Doesn't provide resource control (bandwidth and connections).

   o  Access control with many P2P peers is difficult.

3.3.  CDN

   CDNs (Akamai, Limelight, CloudFront, etc.) are widely used to
   delivery contents to the network edge.  It has the following
   features:

   o  Allows content to be distributed globally.

   o  Push contents to network edge.

   o  Lower latency, reduces upstream bandwidth requirement by content
      owner.

   However, the following drawbacks make it not suitable for DECADE:

   o  Doesn't provide resource control (bandwidth and connections).

   o  Access control with many P2P peers is difficult.

3.4.  NFS

   Network File System is designed to operate the file in the network.

   o  NFS allows a user on a client computer to access files over a
      network in a manner similar to how local storage is accessed.

   o  pNFS allows clients to access storage devices directly and in
      parallel.

   However, the following drawbacks make it not suitable for DECADE:

   o  Doesn't provide resource control (bandwidth and connections).

   o  Access control with many P2P peers is difficult.

3.5.  Others

   There are other systems providing in-network storage to end users.
   For example, Amazon S3 [reference] provides Online storage service.
   Users create buckets and buckets contain stored objects.  Users can
   send the buckets to the network storage or retrieve it.  It is
   popular backend storage for other services.  But it does not provide
   resource control (bandwidth and connections) as it is not designed
   for P2P use.

   OcenStore is another storage platform.  It provides:

   o  Globally distributed storage.

   o  Multiple storage providers pool resources together.

   o  Focus on resiliency.

   However, it doesn't provide resource control (bandwidth and
   connections).
