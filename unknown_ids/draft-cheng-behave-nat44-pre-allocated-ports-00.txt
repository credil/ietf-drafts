Abstract

   This document specifies a NAT44 operation model where external
   ports are pre-allocated per subscriber. The NAT44 function is
   deployed in carrier's networks also known as CGN. Two new RADIUS
   attributes are proposed to support that operation for
   configuration and billing purpose. Translation logging on a
   NAT44 device is significantly reduced with this operational model.

  1. Introduction

   There are currently several IPv4 address sharing mechanisms such as
   NAT444([I-D.shirasaki-nat444-isp-shared-addr]) and DS-Lite
   ([I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite]) because of shortage of IPv4
   addresses. When an IP flow is initiated from a user side and its
   source IPv4 address is replaced by a shared IPv4 address at a NAT44
   device, the source TCP/UDP port in the IPv4 packet is also replaced
   by one dynamically allocated by the NAT44 device, most likely from a
   single port pool, and as such, the IP flow can be uniquely

   identified end-to-end. A NAT44 device usually randomizes the port
   selection, and this practice helps enhance the security in the
   network.

   However, such practice increases the translation logging task on
   a NAT44 device. Note each NAT44 translation log entry corresponds
   to a unique IP flow and typically includes the destination address
   and port, translated source address (the shared IPv4 address),
   translated source port (the one allocated by the NAT44 device),
   original source address and port, etc. It requires large volume of
   storage and also processing capacity on a NAT44 device for such
   operation (see Section 11 of
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues]).

   This document proposes an operation model for NAT44, where a maximum
   number of TCP/UDP ports is configured on a RADIUS server for each
   subscriber as part of the user profile. This information is passed to
   the NAT44 device where a subscriber is attached. The NAT44
   dynamically pre-allocates a port range for a given subscriber, and
   the number of ports in that range must be less or equal to the
   maximum number of ports that has been assigned. When a new IP flow
   arrives from the subscriber, the NAT44 then allocates dynamically a
   port from the pre-allocated port range for the subscriber, also
   assigns a shared IPv4 address. The NAT44 would need to pass the
   pre-allocated port range along with the shared IPv4 address to the
   RADIUS server and the information may be used for billing purpose.
   The communication between the NAT44 and RADIUS server uses RADIUS
   protocol ([RFC2865]), requiring NAS co-locates with the NAT44 device.

   Note a NAT44 may pre-allocate more than one port ranges for any
   given subscriber, as long as the total number of ports is less or
   equal to the maximum number of ports configured on the RADIUS
   server for that subscriber. The actual pre-allocation is entirely
   based on necessity during the operation, but the actual algorithm
   behind this is out of the scope of this document.

   This NAT44 port pre-allocation model using RADIUS service could
   hopefully reduce substantially the intensity on a NAT44 when
   performing session based logging, while still able to conduct
   port allocation with randomization.

   To support this operation model, two new RADIUS attributes are
   defined in this document as follows:

     1) The Nat-Max-Port-Count attribute carries the maximum number of
        TCP/UDP ports that a NAT44 device can use for a given subscriber

        during the translation. The information is configured on a
        RADIUS server and passed to a NAT44 device.

     2) The Nat-Port-Range attribute carries a block of contiguous
        ports that a NAT44 device pre-allocates for a given subscriber
        along with a shared IPv4 address. This information is passed
        to a RADIUS server from the NAT44 device.

  2. Terminology

   This document introduces two terms as follows:

     . Max port count

        This is the maximum number of TCP/UDP ports for a given
        subscriber, which can be used at a NAT44 device.

     . Port range

        This specifies a contiguous TCP/UDP ports, indicated by the
        port with the smallest numerical number and the port with
        the largest numerical number.

  3. Operation

   The per-subscriber based maximum port count is configured on
   a RADIUS server, along with other user information such as
   credentials. The value of the port count is based on service
   agreement and its specification is out of the scope of this
   document.

   A Network Access Server (NAS), located on a NAT44 device,
   operates as a RADIUS client.

   A subscriber initiates a service request, which is sent to the
   NAT44 device that hosts a NAS, which in turn sends a RADIUS
   Access-Request message to a RADIUS server. If the server approves
   the request after validation, it replies with an Access-Accept
   message back to the NAS, where the message includes a list of
   parameters for the associated IP session but also the maximum
   number of ports as defined in this document. While some parameters
   are passed to the subscriber, the maximum port count for that
   subscriber is recorded on the NAT44 device.

   Upon obtaining the maximum port count for a subscriber, the NAT44
   device pre-allocates some ports for the subscriber that are used
   during NAT44 procedure when receiving IPv4 flows sent from that

   subscriber. The NAT44 may allocates one or more port ranges, where
   each range contains a contiguous ports, and the total number of
   ports must be less or equal to the maximum port count that it
   records for that subscriber. A NAT44 device may choose to allocate
   a small range of ports, and allocate more at a later time as
   needed; such practice is good due to its randomization.

   At the same time, the NAT44 device also needs to decide the shared
   IPv4 address for that subscriber. The shared IPv4 address and the
   pre-allocated port range are then passed to the RADIUS server.

   When a subscriber initiates an IPv4 flow, the NAT44 device
   randomly selects a port from the pre-allocated port range for that
   subscriber to replace the original source port, along with the
   replacement of the source IPv4 address by the shared IPv4 address.

   Figure-1 illustrates how RADIUS protocol is used to configure
   the maximum number of ports for a given subscriber on a NAT44
   device, and obtains the shared IPv4 address and pre-allocated
   port range determined by the NAT44 device for that subscriber.

Internet-Draft         NAT44 with Pre-allocated Ports      August 2010

   [Editor's notes - one issue was raised that a NAT44 may create too
   many fixed port ranges for a given maximum port count (perhaps due
   to a poor implementation), resulting too many RADIUS messages. It
   may be useful to define an additional parameter, called "maximum
   port range count", which defines the maximum number of port ranges
   a NAT44 may create for a given subscriber. This parameter is defined
   along side of the "maximum port count" and carried by the same
   RADIUS attribute. This issue and the need of the additional
   parameter will be discussed and added to the next revision if
   required.]

  3.1. An Example

   An ISP assigns 1000 ports for the subscriber A based on a
   service agreement. This number is the maximum number
   of ports that can be used during NAT44 on a NAT44 device for A,
   and is configured on a RADIUS server. When A registers with
   the ISP's Internet service after required AAA procedure, the
   RADIUS server passes the maximum port count (1000) to the NAT44
   device that is co-located with a BNG that connects A to
   the Internet.

   The NAT44 device decides to pre-allocate a small port pool that
   contains 40 contiguous ports, from 3500 to 3540, inclusively,
   and also assign a shared IPv4 address 192.27.30.15, for A.

   The NAT44 device passes this port range (3500-3540) and the
   shared IPv4 address 192.27.30.15 together to the RADIUS server.

   When A initiates a new IP flow that reaches the NAT44, the
   original source IP address is replaced by 192.27.30.15, and
   the source port is replaced by an available one that is
   randomly selected in the port range, say port 3521.

   If at a later time, the port pool (3500-3540) is close to
   exhaustion, the NAT44 device pre-allocates a second port range
   in a similar fashion, with the same or different number of
   ports as in the first one, say from 8500 to 8800, inclusively.
   The NAT44 then passes this port range (8500-8800) and IPv4
   address 192.27.30.15 together to the RADIUS server.

  4. RADIUS Attributes

  Two new RADIUS attributes are defined in this document in order to
  achieve the NAT44 operational model as described in Section 3.

  The Nat-Max-Port-Count attribute carries the maximum number of
  TCP/UDP ports that a NAT44 device can use during NAT44 procedure

Internet-Draft         NAT44 with Pre-allocated Ports      August 2010

  for a given subscriber. This maximum number of ports for a given
  subscriber is configured on a RADIUS server as part of the user's
  profile, and conveyed to the NAT44 device during the user
  registration.

  The Nat-Port-Range attribute carries a contiguous TCP/UDP ports that
  a NAT44 device has pre-allocated to be used during NAT44 procedure
  for a given subscriber, along with an IPv4 address, which may be
  shared with other subscribers. This information is sent by the NAT44
  device to a RADIUS server and may be used for billing purpose.

  4.1. Nat-Max-Port-Count Attribute

     Description

     This Attribute specifies the maximum number of TCP/UDP ports that
     is assigned to a NAT44 device corresponding to a specific
     subscriber for NAT44 operation.

     The Nat-Max-Port-Count MAY appear in an Access-Accept packet, and
     it MAY also appear in an Access-Request packet as a hint by the
     NAS to the server as a preference, although the RADIUS server is
     not required to honor the hint.

     The Nat-Max-Port-Count MAY appear in an Accounting-Request
     packet.

     The Nat-Max-Port-Count MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS packets.
