   Problem statement for distributed and dynamic mobility management
                 draft-chan-distributed-mobility-ps-00

Abstract

   Mobility solutions deployed with centralized mobility anchoring in
   existing hierarchical mobile networks are more prone to the following
   problems or limitations compared with distributed and dynamic
   mobility management: (1) Routing via a centralized anchor is often
   longer, so that those mobility protocol deployments that lack
   optimization extensions results in non-optimal routes, affecting
   performance; whereas routing optimization may be an integral part of
   a distributed design. (2) As mobile network becomes more flattened
   centralized mobility management can become more non-optimal,
   especially as the content servers in a content delivery network (CDN)
   are moving closer to the access network; in contrast, distributed
   mobility management can support both hierarchical network and more
   flattened network as it also supports CDN networks. (3) Centralized
   route maintenance and context maintenance for a large number of
   mobile hosts is more difficult to scale. (4) Scalability may worsen
   when lacking mechanism to distinguish whether there are real need for
   mobility support; dynamic mobility management, i.e., to selectively
   provide mobility support, is needed and may be better implemented
   with distributed mobility management. (5) Deployment is complicated
   with numerous variants and extensions of mobile IP; these variants
   and extensions may be better integrated in a distributed and dynamic
   design which can selectively adapt to the needs. (6) Excessive
   signaling overhead should be avoided when end nodes are able to
   communicate end-to-end; capability to selectively turn off signaling
   that are not needed by the end hosts will reduce the handover delay.
   (7) Centralized approach is generally more vulnerable to a single
   point of failure and attack often requiring duplication and backups,
   whereas a distributed approach intrinsically mitigates the problem to
   a local network so that the needed protection can be simpler.

1.  Introduction

   In the past decade a fair number of mobility protocols have been
   standardized.  Although the protocols differ in terms of functions
   and associated message format, we can identify a few key common
   features:
      presence of a centralized mobility anchor providing global
      reachability and an always-on experience;
      extensions to optimize handover performance while users roam
      across wireless cells;
      extensions to enable the use of heterogeneous wireless interfaces
      for multi-mode terminals (e.g. cellular phones).
   The presence of the centralized mobility anchor allows a mobile
   device to be reachable when it is not connected to its home domain.
   The anchor, among other tasks, ensures forwarding of packets destined
   to or sent from the mobile device.  As such, most of the deployed
   architectures today have a small number of centralized anchors
   managing the traffic of millions of mobile subscribers.  Coompared
   with a distributed approach, a centralized approach have several
   issues or limitations affecting performance and scalability, which
   require costly network dimensioning and engineering to fix them.

   To optimize handovers for mobile users, the base protocols have been
   extended to efficiently handle packet forwarding between the previous
   and new points of attachment.  These extensions are necessary when
   applications impose stringent requirements in terms of delay.
   Notions of localization and distribution of local agents have been
   introduced to reduce signalling overhead.  Unfortunately today we
   witness difficulties in getting such protocols deployed, often
   leading to sub-optimal choices.

   Moreover, all the availability of multi-mode devices and the
   possibility to use several network interfaces simultaneously have
   motivated the development of more new protocol extensions.
   Deployment will be further complicated with so many extensions.

   Mobile users are, more than ever, consuming Internet content, and
   impose new requirements on mobile core networks for data traffic
   delivery.  When this traffic demand exceeds available capacity,
   service providers need to implement new strategies such as selective
   traffic offload (e.g. 3GPP work items LIPA/SIPTO) through alternative
   access networks (e.g.  WLAN).  Moreover, the localization of content
   providers closer to the Mobile/Fixed Internet Service Providers
   network requires taking into account local Content Delivery Networks
   (CDNs) while providing mobility services.

   As long as demand exceeds capactity, both offloading and CDN
   techniques could benefit from the development of more flat mobile

   architectures (i.e., fewer levels of routing hierarchy introduced
   into the data path by the mobility management system).  This view is
   reinforced by the shift in users!_ traffic behavior, aimed at
   increasing direct communications among peers in the same geographical
   area.  The development of truly flat mobile architectures would
   result in anchoring the traffic closer to point of attachment of the
   user and overcoming the suboptimal routing issues of a centralized
   mobility scheme.

   While deploying [Paper-Locating.User] today!_s mobile networks,
   service providers face new challenges.  More often than not, mobile
   devices remain attached to the same point of attachment, in which
   case specific IP mobility management support is not required for
   applications that launch and complete while connected to the same
   point of attachment.  However, the mobility support has been designed
   to be always on and to maintain the context for each mobile
   subscriber as long as they are connected to the network.  This can
   result in a waste of resources and ever-increasing costs for the
   service provider.  Infrequent mobility and intelligence of many
   applications suggest that mobility can be provided dynamically, thus
   simplifying the context maintained in the different nodes of the
   mobile network.

   The proposed work will address two complementary aspects of mobility
   management procedures: the distribution of mobility anchors to
   achieve a more flat design and the dynamic activation/deactivation of
   mobility protocol support as an enabler to distributed mobility
   management.  The former has the goal of positioning mobility anchors
   (HA, LMA) closer to the user; ideally, these mobility agents could be
   collocated with the first hop router.  The latter, facilitated by the
   distribution of mobility anchors, aims at identifying when mobility
   must be activated and identifying sessions that do not impose
   mobility management -- thus reducing the amount of state information
   to be maintained in the various mobility agents of the mobile
   network.  The key idea is that dynamic mobility management relaxes
   some constraints while also repositioning mobility anchors; it avoids
   the establishment of non optimal tunnels between two anchors
   topologically distant.

   This document discusses the issues with centralized IP mobility
   management compared with distributed and dynamic mobility management.
   A companion document [dmm-senario] discusses the use case senarios.

   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Centralized versus distributed mobility management

   Mobility management functions may be implemented at different layers
   of the OSI stack.  At the IP layer, they may reside in the network or
   in the mobile node.  In particular, network-based solution resides in
   the network only.  It therefore enables mobility for hosts and
   network applications which lack mobility support in them but are
   already in deployment.

   At the IP layer, a mobility management protocol to achieve session
   continuity are typically based on the principle of distinguishing
   between session identifier and routing address and maintaining a
   mapping between them.  With Mobile IP, the home address takes the
   role of session identifier whereas the care-of-address takes the role
   of routing address, and the binding between them is maintained at the
   mobility anchor, i.e., the home agent.

   Mobility management functions in the network may be centralized or
   distributed, as is explained in the next two subsections.

3.1.  Centralized mobility management

   With centralized mobility management, the mapping information is kept
   at a centralized mobility anchor, and packets destined to the mobile
   node are routed via this anchor.  That is, such mobility management
   systems are centralized in both the data plane and the control plane.

   Existing mobility solutions leverage on centralized mobility
   anchoring in a hierarchical architecture.  Examples of such
   centralized mobility anchors are the home agent (HA) and local
   mobility anchor (LMA) in mobile IP [RFC3775] and proxy mobile IP
   [RFC5213] respectively.  Current mobile networks such as UMTS
   network, CDMA network, and 3GPP SAE network also use centralized
   mobility management.

3.2.  Distributed mobility management

   The mobility management functions may be distributed to multiple
   locations in different networks, so that a mobile node in any of
   these networks may be served by a close by mobility function (MF).

   Distributed mobility management may be partially distributed, i.e.,

   approaches are described in [I-D.dmm-scenario].


4.  Problem statement

   This section describes the problems or limitations in a centralized
   mobility approach and compares it against the distributed approach.

4.1.  Non-optimal routes

   Routing via a centralized anchor often results in a longer route.
   Figure 3 shows two cases of non-optimized routes.  In the first case,
   the mobile node and the correspondent node are close to each other

   but are both far from the mobility anchor.  In the second case, the
   mobile node is getting content from a local content delivery network
   (CDN).  In both cases, packets destined to the MN have to be routed
   via the mobility anchor, which is not in the shortest path.

   With the centralized mobility anchor design, route optimization

Internet-Draft                   DMM-PS                     October 2010


   extensions to mobility protocols are therefore needed, and those
   mobility protocol deployments that lack such optimization extensions
   will encounter non-optimal routes, which affect performance.  In
   contrast, route optimization may be an integral part of a distributed
   design.

4.2.  Network architecture evolution

   The centralized mobility management is currently deployed to support
   the existing hierarchical networks.  It leverages on the hierarchical
   architecture.  However, the volume of wireless data traffic continues
   to increase exponentially.  The data traffic increase would require
   too much costly capacity upgrade of centralized architectures.  It is
   thus predictable that the data traffic increase will soon overload
   the centralized data anchor point, e.g., P-GW in 3GPP/SAE.  In order
   to address this issue, a trend in the evolution of mobile networks is
   to distribute the network functions close to the access gateways.
   These network functions can be the content servers in a Content
   Delivery Network (CDN) but also the data anchor point.

   As mobile network becomes more flattened the centralized mobility
   management can become non-optimal.

   Mobility management deployment with distributed architecture is then
   needed to support the more flattened network and the CDN networks.
   In addition, such distributed design may likely be able to also
   support the hierarchical network.

4.3.  Centralized route and mobility context maintenance

   Routes are set up to enable session continuity when handover occurs.
   Mobility contexts are also maintained to route via a mobility anchor.

   Setting up such routes and maintaining the mobility context is more
   difficult to scale in a centralized design with a large number of
   mobile hosts.  Distributing the route maintenance function and the
   mobility context maintenance function among different networks can be
   more scalable.

4.4.  Need versus no need for mobility support

   The problem of centralized route and mobility context maintenance is
   aggravated when the via routes are set up for many more mobile nodes
   that are not going to physically move out of a radio cell.  For
   example, the user may be communicating at home, in one's office, or
   at a cafe.  Much more resources are also wasted to maintain the
   mobility context of these routes.  Similarly, intelligent
   applications that do not need network-layer mobility support coexist



Chan (Ed.)               Expires April 22, 2011                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                   DMM-PS                     October 2010


   with applications lacking such intelligence.

   Dynamic mobility management, i.e., to dynamically set up the via
   routes only for mobile nodes that actually undergoes handover and
   lacks higher-layer mobility support, is needed.  With distributed
   mobility anchors, the mechanism to support dynamic mobility may then
   also be distributed.  Therefore, dynamic mobility and distributed
   mobility may complement each other and may be integrated.

4.5.  Numerous variants and extensions of MIP

   Mobile IP (MIP) already has numerous variants and extensions
   including PMIP, FMIP, HMIP, and there may be more to come.
   Deployment can then become complicated, especially if
   interoperability with existing deployments is an issue.

   Because the distributed mobility management needs to work both with
   network architectures of hierarchical networks as well as flattened
   networks, our design needs to be flexible enough to support different
   networks.  In addition, one goal of dynamic mobility management is
   the capability to selectively turn on and off mobility support and
   certain different mobility signaling.  Such flexibility in the design
   provides a good foundation to integrate the different mobility
   variants.  Some additional extensions to the base protocols may then
   be needed to improve the integration.

4.6.  Peer-to-peer communication

   As MIPv6 Route Optimization (RO) mode enables a more efficient data
   packets exchange than the bidirectional tunneling (BT) mode, it is
   expected to be used whenever possible unless the mobile node is not
   interested in disclosing its topological location, i.e., care-of
   address, for the CN (e.g., for privacy reasons) or some other network
   constraints are put in place.

   However, MIPv6 RO mode requires exchanging a significant amount of
   signaling messages in order to establish, and periodically refresh a
   bidirectional security association (BSA) between the mobile node and
   the correspondent node (CN).  While the mobility signaling exchange
   impacts the overall handoff latency, the BSA is needed to
   authenticate the binding update and acknowledgment messages (note
   that the latter is not mandatory).  In addition, the amount of
   mobility signaling messages increases further when both endpoints are
   mobile.

   A dynamic mobility management capability to turn off these signaling
   when they are not needed will enable the RO mode between two mobile
   endpoints at minimum or no cost.  It will reduce the handoff latency

   owing to the removal of the extra signaling.  It will encourage its
   adoption and large scale deployment.

4.7.  Single point of failure and attack

   A centralized anchoring architecture is generally more vulnerable to
   a single point of failure or attack, requiring duplication and
   backups of the support functions.

   A distributed mobility management architecture has intrinsically
   mitigated the problem to a local network which is then of a smaller
   scope.  In addition, the availability of such functions in
   neighboring networks has already provided the needed architecture to
   support protection.
