Abstract

   This memo describes the behaviour of BitTorrent service in the
   context of IP shared addresses.  It provides an overview of the used
   testbed and main results of the tests that have been conducted in
   order to assess the limitations of an architecture based on shared IP
   addresses.

1.  Introduction

   Recently, several proposals have been disseminated within IETF to
   contribute to solve the IP exhaustion problem.  These solutions may
   be grouped into two categories:

      (1) Solutions which propose the introduction of a second level of
      NAT (Network Address Translator), denoted also as Carrier Grade
      NAT (CG-NAT).  This node is located in the Service Provider
      domain.  Private addresses are assigned to end-user CPEs, which
      still perform their own NAT.  The CG-NAT is responsible for
      translating IP packets issued with private addresses to ones with
      publicly routable IPv4 addresses (especially when exiting the
      domain of the Service Provider).
      [ID.durand-softwire-dual-stack-lite] is a variant of these
      solutions where there is only one NAT hosted in the Service
      Provider's network.

      (2) Solutions which avoid the introduction of a NAT in the Service
      Provider's network.  Examples of these solutions are
      [ID.ymbk-aplusp], [ID.boucadair-port-range], [ID.despres-sam] and
      [ID.bajko-v6ops-port-restricted-ipaddr-assign].  These solutions
      allocate the same IP public address to several customers at the
      same time.  They also allocate a restricted port range to each
      customer so that two customers with the same IP address have two
      different port ranges that do not overlap.

   Both the above listed categories are based on sharing an IP address
   between several machines.  In this context, the delivery of some
   services may be impacted, especially those enforcing a restriction
   based on the source IP address.

   This memo focuses on BitTorrent as an example of application which
   applies a restriction based on IP address.  This memo describes a
   testing campaign that has been carried out to assess the impact of IP
   shared address on BitTorrent.

   Testing activities are conducted using a testbed which is configured
   according to the solution described in [ID.boucadair-port-range].


2.  BitTorent Overview

2.1.  BitTorrent at a Glance

   BitTorrent is a distributed file sharing infrastructure.  It is based
   on P2P (Peer to Peer) techniques for exchanging files between
   connected users.  Three parties are involved in a BitTorrent

   architecture as detailed hereafter:

   1.  The Server: The server into which, has been uploaded the torrent
       file.

   2.  The Tracker: Maintains a list of clients which have the file or
       some portions of that file.

   3.  The Client: Entities which are downloading and/or uploading
       portions of the file.  Two categories of clients may be
       distinguished:

       A.  Leechers: Clients which are currently downloading the file
           but do not yet detain all the portions of the file.  As for
           the portions already obtained, the leechers upload them
           towards requesting clients;

       B.  Seeders: Clients which detain all the portions of the file
           and are uploading them to other requesting clients.

   A torrent file is a file which includes the meta-data information of
   the file to be shared: the file name, its length, a hash and the URL
   of the tracker.  In order to download a given file, a BitTorrent
   client needs to obtain the corresponding torrent file.  Afterwards,
   it connects to the tracker to retrieve a list of leechers and
   seeders.  Then, the client connects to those machines and downloads
   the available portions of the requested file.  It uploads also the
   portions already obtained towards requesting clients.

2.2.  Software Configuration

   This section provides an overview of installed tools.

2.2.1.  BitTorrent Client

   Various BitTorrent clients are available for public use.  The
   following one has been installed for the purposes of our testing
   activities:

   URL: www.bittorrent.com

   The installed version is 6.1.

2.2.2.  BitTorrent Server

   The BitTorrent server that has been used is the following:

   The BitTorrent tracker that has been used is the following:

   URL: www.metro-torrent.com/announce.php


3.  Testbed Overview

3.1.  Testbed Description

   The testbed used to conduct the testing activities, described in
   Section 5, is the same as the one described in Section 4 of
   [ID.boucadair-port-range].

   o  The PRR (Port Range Router) is responsible to implement a port-
      driven routing so as to be able to route incoming traffic to the
      appropriate machine among those having the same IP address.

   o  CPE-1 and CPE-2 are two CPEs to which the same IP address is
      assigned.  In order to discriminate these CPEs, distinct Port
      Masks [ID.boucadair-dhc-port-range] are assigned to each of these
      CPE.

   o  T1 (respectively T2) is a machine located in the LAN behind CPE-1
      (respectively CPE-2).

   o  RT1 and RT2 are remote machines reachable through Internet.

5.  Results

   BitTorrent client can be configured to accept multiple connections
   using the same IP address.  A dedicated parameter can therefore be
   positioned.  This parameter is called: bt.allow_same_ip.  Possible
   values that can be taken by this parameter are: FALSE (0) or TRUE
   (1).

   For the testing activities, two configurations have been tested:

   1.  First Configuration: bt.allow_same_ip == TRUE

   2.  Second Configuration: bt.allow_same_ip == FALSE

   The following sub-sections describe the obtained results for each
   configuration.

5.1.  First Configuration: Multiple Connections with the same IP address
      are enabled

   The following table summarises the results of the aforementioned
   tests as performed using the testbed described in Section 4.  Note
   that bt.allow_same_ip is positioned to TRUE.

                  Results: Multiple connections desiabled


6.  Conclusions

   This memo describes the main behaviour of BitTorrent service in an IP
   shared address environment.  Particularly, the tests have been
   carried out on a testbed implementing [ID.boucadair-port-range]
   solution.  The results are, however, valid for all IP shared address
   based solutions.

   Two limitations were experienced.  The first limitation occurs when
   two clients sharing the same IP address want to simultaneously
   retrieve the SAME file located in a SINGLE remote peer.  This
   limitation is due to the default BitTorrent configuration on the
   remote peer which does not permit sending the same file to multiple
   ports of the same IP address.  This limitation is mitigated by the
   fact that clients sharing the same IP address can exchange portions
   with each other, provided the clients can find each other through a
   common tracker, DHT, or Peer Exchange.  Even if they can not, we
   observed that the remote peer would begin serving portions of the
   file automatically as soon as the other client (sharing the same IP
   address) finished downloading.  This limitation is eliminated if the
   remote peer is configured with bt.allow_same_ip == TRUE, which is not
   unlikely.

   The second limitation occurs when a client tries to download a file
   located on several seeders, when those seeders share the same IP
   address.  This is because the clients are enforcing bt.allow_same_ip
   parameter to FALSE.  The client will only be able to connect to one
   seeder, among those having the same IP address, to download the file
   (note that the client can retrieve the file from other seeders having
   distinct IP addresses).  This limitation is eliminated if the local
   client is configured with bt.allow_same_ip == TRUE, which is somewhat
   likely as those clients will directly experience better throughput by
   changing their own configuration.

   Mutual file sharing between hosts having the same IP address has been
   checked.  Indeed, machines having the same IP address can share files
   with no alteration compared to current IP architectures.
