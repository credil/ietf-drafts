    Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) IP Neighbor Discovery
    (IPND), is a method for otherwise oblivious nodes to learn of the
    existence, availability, and addresses of other DTN participants.
    IPND both sends and listens for small IP UDP announcement
    "beacons."  Beacon messages are addressed to an IP unicast, multicast,
    or broadcast destination to discover specified remote
    neighbors, or unspecified local neighbors in the topology, e.g.
    within wireless range.  IPND beacons advertise neighbor
    availability by including the DTN node's canonical endpoint
    identifier.  IPND beacons optionally include service availability
    and parameters.  In this way, neighbor discovery and service
    discovery may be coupled or decoupled as required.  Once
    discovered, new neighbor pairs use advertised availabilities
    to connect, exchange routing information, etc.  This document
    describes DTN IPND.

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>
    Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs) <xref
    target="RFC4838"/> make no presumptions about network topology,
    routing, or availability.  DTNs therefore attempt to provide
    communication in challenged environments where, for instance,
    contemporaneous end-to-end paths do not exist.  Examples of such
    DTNs arise in a variety of contexts including mobile social
    networks, space communications, rural message delivery, military
    networks, etc.
    </t>
    <t>
    In many DTN scenarios, the identity and meeting
    schedule of participating nodes is not known in advance.
    Therefore, an important primitive is Neighbor Discovery (ND), or
    the ability to dynamically discover other DTN nodes.  This document
    specifies Internet Protocol Neighbor Discovery (IPND).  In
    contrast to link or physical layer discovery, IPND enables a
    general form of neighbor discovery across a heterogeneous range
    of links, as are often found in DTN networks.  IPND is particularly
    useful in mobile, ad-hoc DTN environments where meeting
    opportunities are not known a priori and connections may appear
    or disappear without warning.  For example, two mobile nodes
    might come into radio distance of each other, discover the new
    connection, and move data along that connection before physically
    disconnecting.
    </t>
    <t>
    In addition to discovering neighbors, it is often valuable to
    simultaneously discover services available from that neighbor.
    Examples of DTN services include a neighbor's available
    Convergence Layer Adapters (CLAs) and their parameters (e.g.
    <xref target="TCPCLA"/>), available routers (e.g. <xref
    target="PROPHET"/>), tunnels, etc.  Newly discovered nodes will
    then typically participate in bundle <xref target="RFC5050"/>
    routing and delivery.  
    </t>
    <t>
    In other situations it is useful to decouple service
    discovery from neighbor discovery for efficiency and generality.
    For example, upon discovering a neighbor, a DTN node might
    initiate a separate negotiation process to establish 1-hop
    connectivity via a particular convergence layer, perform routing
    setup, exchange availability information, etc.  
    </t>
    <t>
    IPND beacons thus optionally advertise a node's available
    services while maintaining the ability to decouple node and
    service discovery as necessary.  This flexibility is important to
    various DTN use scenarios where connection opportunities may be
    limited (thus necessitating an atomic message for all
    availability information), bandwidth might be scarce (thus
    implying that service discovery should be an independent
    negotiation to lower beacon overhead), or connections have very
    large round-trip-times (service negotiation is therefore too
    costly with respect to time).
    </t>
    <t>
    DTN IPND is designed to be simple, efficient, and general.
    </t>
    <t>
    Although this document describes a neighbor discovery protocol
    in terms of IP, the principles and basic mechanisms used in this
    protocol may also be expressed in terms of other datagram protocols.

  <section title="Protocol Description">
    <t>
    Nodes use DTN IPND beacons, small UDP messages in the IP
    underlay, to advertise presence.  Similarly, IPND beacons
    received from other nodes serve to detect the availability of DTN
    neighbors.  Nodes SHOULD both send and receive beacons.  These
    beacon messages, detailed in <xref target="beacons"/>, may be
    sent either as IP unicast, multicast, or broadcast UDP packets.
    The beacon message content is agnostic to the underlying
    transport mode.
    </t>
    <t>
    Broadcast beacons are designed to reach unknown neighbors in
    neighborhoods within the local network broadcast domain.
    Multicast <xref target="RFC1112"/> beacons extend the scope of
    beacon dissemination to potentially include multiple networks
    across routed boundaries.  On broadcast media such as Ethernet or
    wireless, multicast and broadcast beacons are sent as link-layer
    broadcast messages.  
    </t>
    <t>
    Broadcast and multicast discovery are described in <xref
    target="multicast"/>.  In contrast, unicast beacons are sent only
    to explicitly known and enumerated neighbors as described in
    <xref target="unicast"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
    Upon discovering a neighbor, IPND can establish a connection
    to the new neighbor via an IP-based Convergence Layer Adapter
    (CLA), for example the TCP <xref target="TCPCLA"/> or UDP <xref
    target="UDPCLA"/> CLA.  The CLA then negotiates the connection
    per its individual specification and installs the appropriate
    next-hop routing information in the local node.
    </t>

      <section title="Beacon Period" anchor="beacon_period">
      <t>
      An IPND implementation SHOULD send beacons periodically.  The
      time interval between beacons SHOULD be appropriate for the
      conditions of the network and MAY be configurable.
      </t>
      <t>
      A receiving node SHOULD know the expected beacon interval and
      use this parameter, along with the existence and time of
      received beacons to determine whether state of the sender's
      ability to transmit to the receiver, i.e., the up or down
      state of the sender to receiver link.  The exact algorithm for
      determining the link status based on received beacons is
      implementation-defined.
      </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Unknown Neighbors" anchor="multicast">
      <t>
      In the general case, the IP addresses of potential
      neighbors are not known in advance.  To discover unknown
      neighbors, IPND beacon messages are sent as IP packets with
      either multicast or broadcast destination addresses.  IPND MUST
      support multicast IP destination addresses <xref
      target="RFC1112"/> and multicast IGMP group membership <xref
      target="RFC3376"/>.  IPND MAY support IP broadcast destinations.
      IPND multicast addresses SHOULD be from the IANA assigned local
      network control block 224.0.0/24 <xref target="RFC3171"/>.  This
      block of multicast addresses is intentionally scoped to the local
      network to prevent dissemination to the wider Internet.
      </t>
 
      <t>
      IPND MAY also use other multicast addresses as required, such as
      multicast addresses from the IANA assigned Internetwork Control
      Block <xref target="RFC3171"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
      In all cases, IPND MUST support a configurable IP time-to-live
      value for all beacon messages.
      </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Enumerated Neighbors" anchor="unicast">
      <t>
      IPND MUST support multicast or broadcast beacons and SHOULD support
      both.
      IPND SHOULD support unicast beacons.  Since multicast or broadcast
      discovery is not feasible over internetworks, the IP addresses of
      potential neighbors reachable only across multiple underlay hops must be
      explicitly enumerated for discovery.  While the neighbor's address is therefore
      known, the availability of that neighbor is not known.  IPND thus
      permits DTN nodes to discover available remote neighbors across
      multiple IP underlay hops when provided with the addresses of those neighbors.
      In
      this way, IPND can be used to bridge IP-based DTNs while detecting
      disconnections among and between the DTNs.
      </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Allowing Data to Substitute for Beacons" anchor="suppress">
	<t>
	Sending data to an IP address matching a configured beacon destination
	SHOULD suppress the generation of beacon messages to that destination
	for a period of time up to but no longer than the beacon sending interval.
	This suppression SHOULD NOT occur if the
	parameters of a new beacon message would differ from the preceding
	beacon including the <xref target="services"> advertised services </xref>
	or <xref target="neighborhood_bloomfilter"> Neighborhood Bloom Filter (NBF)</xref>.
	</t>

	<t>
	Upon receiving a data packet from a neighbor where
	the packets do not represent a beacon, a node SHOULD behave as
	if a beacon had been received from that neighbor, as follows.

        If the data packet is addressed to this node via a unicast address,
        then the behavior SHOULD be as if the implied received beacon
        contains a Neighborhood Bloom Filter which indicates the membership
        of the receiving node in the sender's 1-hop neighborhood.
        Otherwise, if the destination address is multicast or broadcast,
        then the receiving node should presume that the link is
        bidirectional if and only if its state was bidirectional prior to
        receiving the data packet.  See <xref target="bidirectional"/>.

        The sender's advertised services are presumed to be unchanged
        since the sender's last received beacon.  If no beacons have
        previously been received from such a neighbor, then
	it is presumed that there are no services associated with the sender.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Discovering Bidirectional Links" anchor="bidirectional">
      <t>
      Many routing protocols work correctly only when links are bidirectional.
      In wired IP networks, link bidirectionality can often be presumed.
      For other types of networks, such as Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) this
      assumption often does not hold.  If a link to a neighbor is said to be
      "up" only because one or more beacon messages have been received from
      that neighbor over a wireless medium, it is not generally safe
      to assume that the link is bidirectional.  In practice, MANET networks
      often have links that are only unidirectional due to differences
      in antennae, transmit power, hardware variability, multi-path
      effects, etc.
      </t>

      <t>
      To discover the bidirectionality of links, an IPND
      <xref target="neighborhood_bloomfilter">Neighborhood
      Bloom Filter (NBF) </xref> facility MAY be employed in which each
      node advertises a Bloom filter representation of the set of
      neighbors from whom it has
      received enough recent beacons to be considered "up".  Upon receiving
      a beacon from an "up" neighbor that advertises an NBF which
      represents a set containing
      the receiving node's ID, then the link SHOULD be considered
      bidirectional.

        As described previously, beacon messages may optionally

        sufficiently general to accommodate unanticipated services 
        provided by the advertising node.
        </t>
        <t>
        For example, the source IP address of a received beacon
        suffices to identify the remote node at the IP level.  However,
        the IP address alone does not inform other processes via which
        transport mechanism (e.g. TCP or UDP) or via which transport port
        the remote node is offering a connection.  Similarly, nodes do
        not know which routers (e.g. <xref target="PROPHET"/>) are
        running on a remote node in order to inform bundle exchange.
        Therefore, beacons may contain service blocks.

          <t>
          In order to efficiently determine link bidirectionality, a node
          represents the set of its 1-hop neighbors using a Bloom filter
          referred to as the Neighborhood Bloom Filter (NBF).  Upon
          receiving a beacon from a neighbor that contains an NBF,
          a node can quickly determine whether it is in the neighbor's
          NBF set, and thereby determine whether the link is bidirectional.
          </t>

	  <t>
	  Every node that might operate in an environment where discovered
	  links may not be bidirectional SHOULD include a Bloom filter
	  in some of its beacons which describes the membership of its 1-hop
	  neighbor set.  The bits to set in the Bloom filter MUST
	  be computed by computing hash(es) on the canonical EID of each
	  1-hop neighbor considered to be "up".
	  </t>

	  <t>
	  Different networks naturally have distinct
	  requirements, tolerance for overhead, and node computing
	  resources, so the parameters of the Bloom filter such as
	  length, number and types of hash algorithms, etc., are
	  not mandated by IPND.  However, all nodes participating in
	  such a DTN MUST use the same Bloom filter representation and
	  parameters if they send Bloom filters.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	  Bloom filter data, if present, MAY be ignored by a node if its
	  implementation does not provide for it, or if the parameters
	  of the Bloom filter cannot be determined with certainty.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	  Nodes in DTNs with a likelihood of unidirectional links
	  SHOULD provide Bloom filter data in
	  some broadcast or multicast beacons if the routing protocol
	  in use presumes that links are bidirectional.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	  A neighborhood Bloom filter need not be included on every beacon,
	  but one SHOULD be present on at least one broadcast or multicast
	  beacon following a change in the 1-hop neighborhood of the node.
	  A neighborhood Bloom filter MAY be present on every broadcast or
	  multicast beacon beacon.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	  A Bloom filter, if included in a beacon message, MUST be represented
	  by an SDNV, and MUST follow Service Blocks
	  field, if present, or the Canonical EID field if the Service Blocks
	  field is not present.

      <section title="Parameters" anchor="params">
      <t>
      It is RECOMMENDED that implementations of IPND provide the
      following configurable parameters:
      </t>
      <t>Parameters:
        <list style="hanging" hangIndent="5">
        <t hangText="BeaconAddress:">IPv4 address string specifying the beacon
         address destination.  As described previously, the beacon address
         may be either IP unicast, multicast, or broadcast.
        </t>
        <t hangText="BeaconIPTTL:">Time-to-live specifying the beacon
         IPv4 TTL value.

	 <vspace blankLines="1" />

	 Unless beacon messages are intended to be disseminated beyond the local
	 link, the BeaconIPTTL should always be 1.
        </t>
        <t hangText="BeaconPeriod:">Integer wall clock time between 
         sending periodic beacon messages.  The inter-beacon delay granularity
         SHOULD be at least 1 millisecond.
        </t>
        <t hangText="NeighborRecvTimeout:">The neighbor receive
         timeout period.  A minimum integer wall clock time 
         that MAY pass without receiving a beacon before declaring an existing 
         neighbor unreachable.  The neighbor receive timeout SHOULD be at
         least millisecond granularity.
        </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
      The BeaconPeriod and NeighborRecvTimeout parameters should be
      chosen to reflect the expected properties of the network connection
      between two nodes that discover each other via this protocol and the
      requirements of the users of the network.  A typical BeaconPeriod for
      most purposes would be on the order of several seconds, and a typical
      NeighborRecvTimeout is a multiple of the BeaconPeriod.
      </t>
      </section>

      <section title="IPND and CLAs">
      <t>
      IP-based CLAs are generally expected to depend on an
      IPND implementation module for their discovery
      service.  A CLA MAY opt not to use IPND, either because
      that CLA does not require discovery or provides its own.
      </t>
      <t>
      Once IPND discovers a new neighbor it MUST inform all
      CLAs which depend on IPND of the
      neighbor's existence and the discovered parameters.  The exact means
      by which IPND communicates with the CLAs is implementation
      dependent.
      </t>
      <t>
      Similarly, once IPND determines that a link has gone down, it
      MUST inform all dependent CLAs of the link down event.
      </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Disconnection">
      <t>
      Note that IPND SHOULD maintain state over all existing neighbors
      in order to prevent CLAs from needlessly attempting to establish
      connections between nodes that are already connected.  To maintain
      the current neighbor set, IPND removes stale neighbors after the
      defined neighbor receive timeout period elapses without receiving
      any beacon messages from a particular neighbor.  
      </t>
      <t>
      Upon detecting a neighbor that is no longer available, IPND
      MAY provide hints to the CLA that the neighbor is gone.  Note
      that some CLAs themselves provide keepalive-type functionality
      and therefore IPND is not necessarily required to detect down
      neighbors.  However, placing both discovery and availability
      information in IPND provides a single, coherent point in the
      system design to maintain neighbor information.
      </t>
      </section>
  </section>

  <section title="Relation to Other Discovery Protocols">
    <t>
    A variety of discovery protocols exist in other contexts
    and domains.  These discovery protocols include the ability to
    discover available neighbors and services.  For example, the IETF
    zero configuration working group <xref target="RFC3927"/>, the
    bonjour protocol <xref target="BONJOUR"/>, and the OLSR discovery
    protocol <xref target="NHDP"/> all provide similar functionality.
    </t>
    <t>
    Other rendezvous mechanisms are possible that allow a node to
    find a neighbor of a particular type or with particular
    properties.  For example, the Domain Name System (DNS) or
    Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) could be used to find a neighbor
    that provides an inter-planetary gateway.  Such advanced
    rendezvous schemes are beyond the scope of this document.
    </t>
    <t>
    In contrast, DTN-IPND is designed to be DTN-specific,
    efficient, and extremely lightweight.  For instance, DTN-IPND is
    capable of supporting arbitrary length DTN EIDs, and includes CLA
    information in order to maximize the utility of each beacon
    message without requiring multiple round-trip times in order to
    perform complex protocol negotiation.  
    </t>
    <t>
    While DTN-IPND MAY be used in non-DTN environments, its use is
    RECOMMENDED only in DTNs.
    </t>
  </section>

    <section title="Implementation Experience">
    <t>
    BBN Technologies has implemented and deployed DTN IPND as part of 
    the SPINDLE <xref target="SPINDLE"/> project.
    </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t>
    Neighbor discovery may be perceived as an impediment to
    security because it advertises a potential target for attacks.
    Discovering the existence of a particular node is orthogonal to
    securing the services of that node.  Nodes that desire or require
    higher-levels of security SHOULD disable the broadcast IPND
    beacons and rely instead on static neighbor configuration.
    </t>
    <t>
    Further, neighbor discovery represents a potential source of
    network congestion and contention.  Therefore, careful
    consideration should be made to the frequency and TTL scope of
    beacons when setting implementation-specific parameters,
    particularly when a setting affects larger regions of the
    network.
