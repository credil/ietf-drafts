Internet-Draft         Diameter Key Transport AVPs              May 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Diameter EAP application [RFC4072] defines the EAP-Master-
   Session-Key and EAP-Key-Name AVPs for the purpose of transporting
   cryptographic keying material derived during the execution of certain
   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748] methods (for
   example, EAP-TLS [RFC5216]).  At most one instance of either of these
   AVPs is allowed in any Diameter message.

   However, recent work (see, for example, [RFC5295]) has specified
   methods to derive other keys from the keying material created during
   EAP method execution that may require transport in addition to the
   MSK.  In addition, the EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) [RFC5296]
   specifies new keys that may need to be transported between Diameter
   nodes.

   This note specifies a set of AVPs allowing the transport of multiple
   cryptographic keys in a single Diameter message.


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Technical Terms and Acronyms

   DSRK
      Domain-Specific Root Key [RFC5295].

   MSK
      Master Session Key [RFC3748].

   rMSK
      reauthentication MSK [RFC5296].  This is a per-authenticator key,
      derived from the rRK (below).

   rRK
      reauthentication Root Key, derived from the EMSK Extended Master
      Session Key [RFC3748] or DSRK [RFC5296].

3.  Attribute-Value Pair Definitions

   This section defines new AVPs for the transport of cryptographic keys
   in the Diameter EAP application [RFC4072], as well as other Diameter
   applications.

3.1.  Key AVP

   The Key AVP (AVP Code <AC1>) is of type Grouped [RFC3588].  It
   contains the type and keying material and, optionally, an indication
   of the usable lifetime of the key, the name of the key and a Security
   Parameter Index (SPI) with which the key is associated.

   Key ::= < AVP Header: AC1 >
             < Key-Type >
             { Keying-Material }
             [ Key-Lifetime ]
             [ Key-Name ]
             [ Key-SPI ]
           * [ AVP ]

3.1.1.  Key-Type AVP

   The Key-Type AVP (AVP Code <AC2>) is of type Enumerated and signifies
   the type of the key being sent.  The following decimal values are
   defined in this document:

   MSK (0)
      The EAP Master Session Key [RFC3748]

   DSRK (1)
      A Domain-Specific Root Key [RFC5295].

   rRK (2)
      A reauthentication Root Key [RFC5296].

   rMSK (3)
      A reauthentication Master Session Key [RFC5296].

   IKEv2-PSK (4)
      A pre-shared key for use in IKE-V2 key exchange
      [I-D.ietf-dime-ikev2-psk-diameter].

   If additional values are needed, they are to be assigned by IANA
   according to the policy stated in Section 5.2

Internet-Draft         Diameter Key Transport AVPs              May 2010


3.1.2.  Key-Name AVP

   The Key-Name AVP is of type OctetString.  It contains an opaque key
   identifier.  Exactly how this name is generated and used depends on
   the key type and usage in question, and is beyond the scope of this
   document (see [RFC5247] and [RFC5295] for discussions of key name
   generation in the context of EAP).

3.1.3.  Keying-Material AVP

   The Keying-Material AVP (AVP Code <AC3>) is of type OctetString.  The
   exact usage of this keying material depends upon several factors,
   including the link layer in use and the type of the key; it is beyond
   the scope of this document.

3.1.4.  Key-Lifetime AVP

   The Key-Lifetime AVP (AVP Code <AC4>) is of type Integer64 [RFC3588]
   and represents the period of time (in seconds) for which the contents
   of the Keying-Material AVP (Section 3.1.3) is valid.

   NOTE:
      Applications using this value SHOULD consider the beginning of the
      lifetime to be the point in time when the message containing the
      keying material is received.

3.1.5.  Key-SPI

   The Key-SPI AVP (AVP Code <AC5>) is of type Unsigned32 and contains a
   SPI value that can be used with other parameters for identifying
   associated keying material.


4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations applicable to the Diameter Base Protocol
   [RFC3588] are also applicable to this document, as are those in
   Section 8.4 of RFC 4072 [RFC4072].


5.  IANA Considerations

   Upon publication of this memo as an RFC, IANA is requested to assign
   values as described in the following sections.

Internet-Draft         Diameter Key Transport AVPs              May 2010


5.1.  AVP Codes

   Codes must be assigned for the following AVPs using the policy
   specified in RFC 3588, Section 11.1.1:

   o  Key (<AC1>, Section 3.1)

   o  Key-Type (<AC2>, Section 3.1.1)

   o  Keying-Material (<AC3>, Section 3.1.3)

   o  Key-Lifetime (<AC4>, Section 3.1.4)

   o  Key-SPI (<AC5>, Section 3.1.5)

5.2.  AVP Values

   IANA is requested to create a new registry for values assigned to the
   Key-Type AVP and populated with the decimal values defined in this
   document (Section 3.1.1).  New values may be assigned for the Key-
   Type AVP using the "Expert Review" policy [RFC5226]; once values have
   been assigned, they MUST NOT be deleted, replaced, modified or
   deprecated.
