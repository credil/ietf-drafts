Collections can be of arbitrary size and depth (i.e., collections within collections).        WebDAV clients that cache resource content need a way to synchronize that data with the server (i.e., detect what has changed        and update their cache). This can currently be done using a WebDAV PROPFIND request on a collection to list all members of a        collection along with their DAV:getetag property values, which allows the client to determine which were changed, added        or deleted. However, this does not scale well to large collections as the XML response to the PROPFIND request will grow with the        collection size.      </t>      <t>        This specification defines a new WebDAV report that results in the server returning to the client only information about those        member URIs that were added or deleted, or whose mapped resources were changed, since a previous execution of the report on the collection.      </t>      <t>        Additionally, a new property is added to collection resources that is used to convey a "synchronization token" that is guaranteed        to change when the collection's member URIs or their mapped resources have changed.      </t>    </section>    <section title='Conventions Used in This Document'>      <t>        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119' />.      </t>      <t>        This document uses XML DTD fragments (<xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20081126"/>, Section 3.2) as a purely notational convention.  WebDAV request and response bodies cannot be validated by a DTD due to the specific extensibility rules defined in Section 17 of [RFC4918] and due to the fact that all XML elements defined by this specification use the XML namespace name "DAV:".

The token defines          the state of the data being synchronized at a particular point in time. It can then be used to determine what has          changed since one point in time and another.        </t>        <t>          This specification defines a new WebDAV report that is used to enable client-server collection synchronization based on such a token.        </t>        <t>          In order to synchronize the contents of a collection between a server and client, the server provides the client with a synchronization          token each time the synchronization report is executed. That token represents the state of the data being synchronized at that point in time.          The client can then present that same token back to the server at some later time and the server will return only those items that are new,          have changed or were deleted since that token was generated. The server also returns a new token representing the new state at the time the report was run.        </t>        <t>          Typically, the first time a client connects to the server it will need to be informed of the entire state          of the collection (i.e., a full list of all member URIs that are currently in the collection).          That is done by the client sending an empty token value to the server. This indicates to the server that a full listing is required.        </t>        <t>          As an alternative, the client might choose to do its first synchronization using some other mechanism on the collection (e.g. some other          form of batch resource information retrieval such as PROPFIND, <xref target="RFC5323">SEARCH</xref> , or specialized REPORTs such as those defined in          <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV</xref> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-vcarddav-carddav">CardDAV</xref>) and ask for the DAV:sync-token property to be returned.          This property (defined in <xref target="sync_property" />) contains the same token that can          be used later on to issue a DAV:sync-collection report.        </t>        <t>          In some cases a server might only wish to maintain a limited amount of history about changes to a collection. In that situation          it will return an error to the client when the client presents a token that is "out of date". At that point the client has to fall          back to synchronizing the entire collection by re-running the report request using an empty token value.        </t>      </section>      <section title='DAV:sync-collection Report'>        <t>          If the DAV:sync-collection report is implemented by a WebDAV server, then the server MUST list the report in the "DAV:supported-report-set"          property on any collection supporting synchronization.        </t>        <t>          To implement the behavior for this report a server needs to keep track of changes to any member URIs and their mapped resources in a collection (as defined in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC4918"/>).          This includes noting the addition of new member URIs, changes to the mapped resources of existing member URIs, and removal of member URIs.          The server will track each change and provide a synchronization "token" to the client that describes the state of the server          at a specific point in time. This "token" is returned as part of the response to the "sync-collection" report. Clients include          the last token they got from the server in the next "sync-collection" report that they execute and the server provides the changes          from the previous state, represented by the token, to the current state, represented by the new token returned.        </t>        <t>          The synchronization token itself is an "opaque" string - i.e., the actual string data has no specific meaning or syntax. However, the token MUST be a valid URI to allow its use in an If pre-condition request header (see <xref target="if_header"/>).          For example, a simple implementation of such a token could be a numeric counter that counts each change as it occurs and relates that change to the specific object that changed. The numeric value could be appended to a "base" URI to form the valid sync-token.        </t>        <t>          Marshalling:          <list>            <t>              The request URI MUST identify a collection.

In the case where multiple member URIs of the request-URI are mapped to the same resource, if the resource is changed, each member URI MUST be returned in the response.            </t>            <t>              The content of each DAV:response element differs depending on how the member was altered:              <list>                <t>                  For members that have changed (i.e., are new or have had their mapped resource modified) the DAV:response MUST contain at least one                  DAV:propstat element and MUST NOT contain any DAV:status element.                </t>                <t>                  For members that have been removed, the DAV:response MUST contain one DAV:status with a value set to '404 Not Found'                  and MUST NOT contain any DAV:propstat element.                </t>                <t>                  For members that are collections and are unable to support the DAV:sync-collection report, the DAV:response MUST contain one DAV:status with a value set to '403 Forbidden', a DAV:error containing DAV:supported-report or DAV:sync-traversal-supported (see <xref target="depth"/> for which is appropriate), and MUST NOT contain any DAV:propstat element.                </t>              </list>            </t>            <t>                The conditions under which each type of change can occur is further described in <xref target="change-types" />.            </t>          </list>        </t>        <t>          Preconditions:          <list>            <t>              (DAV:valid-sync-token): The DAV:sync-token element value MUST be a valid token previously returned by the server. A token              can become invalid as the result of being "out of date" (out of the range of change history maintained by the server), or for              other reasons (e.g. collection deleted, then recreated, access control changes, etc...).            </t>          </list>        </t>        <t>          Postconditions:          <list>            <t>				(DAV:number-of-matches-within-limits): The number of changes reported in the response must fall within the client specified limit.

When this occurs, the server MUST include a DAV:response element for the child collection with status '403 Forbidden'. The 403 response MUST be sent once, when the collection is first reported to the client. In addition, the server MUST include a DAV:error element in the DAV:response element, indicating one of two possible causes for this:          	<list>          		<t>          			The DAV:sync-collection report is not supported at all on the child collection. The DAV:error element MUST contain the DAV:supported-report element.          		</t>          		<t>          			The server is unwilling to report results for the child collection when a Depth:infinity DAV:sync-collection report is executed on a parent resource. This might happen when, for example, the synchronization state of the collection resource is controlled by another sub-system. In such cases clients can perform the DAV:sync-collection report directly on the child collection instead. The DAV:error element MUST contain the DAV:sync-traversal-supported element.          		</t>          	</list>          </t>      </section>      <section title="Types of Changes Reported on Initial Synchronization">          <t>              When the DAV:sync-collection request contains an empty DAV:sync-token element, the server MUST return              all member URIs of the collection (taking account of Depth header requirements as per <xref target="depth"/>, and optional truncation of results set as per <xref target="limit"/>) and it MUST NOT return any removed member URIs.

It also clarifies the case where a member URI              might have undergone multiple changes between two synchronization report requests. In all cases, the Depth header requirements as per <xref target="depth"/>, and optional truncation of results set as per <xref target="limit"/>, are taken into account by the server.          </t>          <section title="Changed Member">              <t>                A member URI MUST be reported as changed if it has been mapped as a member of the target collection since the request sync-token was generated.                This includes member URIs that have been mapped as the result of a COPY, MOVE, <xref target="RFC5842">BIND</xref>, or <xref target="RFC5842">REBIND</xref> request.

There is no guarantee that changes to members of a collection will result in a change in any entity tag of that collection, so clients cannot rely on a series of Depth:1 reports at multiple levels to track all changes within a collection. Instead Depth:infinity has to be used.              </t>          </section>          <section title="Removed Member">              <t>                  A member MUST be reported as removed if its mapping under the target collection has been removed                  since the request sync-token was generated, and it has not been re-mapped since it was removed.  This                  includes members that have been unmapped as the result of a MOVE, <xref target="RFC5842">UNBIND</xref>, or <xref target="RFC5842">REBIND</xref> operation.                  This also includes collection members that have been removed, including ones that themselves do not support the DAV:sync-collection report.              </t>              <t>                  If a member was added (and its mapped resource possibly modified), then removed between two synchronization report requests,                  it MUST be reported as removed. This ensures that a client that adds a member is informed of the removal of the member, if the removal occurs before the client has had a chance to execute a synchronization report.              </t>              <t>                  A member MAY be reported as removed if the user issuing the request no longer has access to this member,                  due to access control changes.              </t>              <t>              	For a Depth:infinity report where a collection is removed, the server MUST NOT report the removal of any members of the removed collection. Clients MUST assume that if a collection is reported as being removed, then all members of that collection have also been removed.              </t>          </section>      </section>      <section title="Truncation of Results" anchor="limit">          <t>              A server MAY limit the number of member URIs in a response, for example, to limit the amount of work expended in processing a request, or as the result of an explicit limit set by the client. If the result set is truncated, the response MUST use status code 207, return a DAV:multistatus response body, and indicate a status of 507 (Insufficient Storage) for the request URI. That DAV:response element SHOULD include a DAV:error element with the DAV:number-of-matches-within-limits precondition, as defined in <xref target="RFC3744"/> (Section 9.2). DAV:response elements for all the changes being reported are also included.          </t>          <t>              When truncation occurs, the DAV:sync-token value returned in the response MUST represent the correct state for the partial set of changes returned. That allows the client to use the returned DAV:sync-token to fetch the next set of changes. In this way the client can effectively "page" through the entire set of changes in a consistent manner.          </t>          <t>              Clients MUST handle the 507 status on the request-URI in the response to the report.          </t>          <t>              For example, consider a server that records changes using a monotonically increasing integer to represent a "revision number" and uses that quantity as the DAV:sync-token value (appropriately encoded as a URI). Assume the last DAV:sync-token used by the client was "http://example.com/sync/10", and since then 15 additional changes have occurred. If the client executes a DAV:sync-collection request with a DAV:sync-token of "http://example.com/sync/10", without a limit the server would return 15 DAV:response elements and a DAV:sync-token with value "http://example.com/sync/25". But if the server choose to limit responses to at most 10 changes, then it would return only 10 DAV:response elements and a DAV:sync-token with value "http://example.com/sync/20", together with an additional DAV:response element for the request-URI with a status code of 507. Subsequently, the client can re-issue the request with the DAV:sync-token value returned from the server and fetch the remaining 5 changes.          </t>      </section>      <section title="Limiting Results" anchor="limits">          <t>              A client can limit the number of results returned by the server through use of the DAV:limit element (<xref target="RFC5323"/>, Section 5.17) in the request body. This is useful when clients have limited space or bandwidth for the results. If a server is unable to truncate the result at or below the requested number, then it MUST fail the request with a DAV:number-of-matches-within-limits post-condition error.

In this case the request fails as another change has occurred to the collection corresponding to the supplied DAV:sync-token.        </t>        <figure>          <preamble>            &gt;&gt; Request &lt;&lt;          </preamble>          <artwork><![CDATA[MKCOL /home/cyrusdaboo/collection/child/ HTTP/1.1Host: webdav.example.comIf: </home/cyrusdaboo/collection/>  (<http://example.com/ns/sync/12346>)]]>          </artwork>        </figure>        <figure>          <preamble>            &gt;&gt; Response &lt;&lt;          </preamble>          <artwork><![CDATA[HTTP/1.1 412 Pre-condition Failed]]>          </artwork>        </figure>      </section>    </section>    <section title="XML Element Definitions">      <section title="DAV:sync-collection XML Element" anchor="sync_collection_element">        <t>          <list style="hanging">            <t hangText="Name:">              sync-collection            </t>            <t hangText="Namespace:">              DAV:            </t>            <t hangText="Purpose:">              WebDAV report used to synchronize data between client and server.            </t>            <t hangText="Description:">              See <xref target="sync-collection" />.            </t>          </list>        </t>        <figure>          <artwork><![CDATA[<!ELEMENT sync-collection (sync-token, DAV:limit?, DAV:prop)><!-- DAV:limit defined in RFC 5323, Section 5.17 --><!-- DAV:prop defined in RFC 4918, Section 14.18 -->]]>          </artwork>        </figure>      </section>      <section title="DAV:sync-token XML Element" anchor="sync_token_element">          <t>            <list style="hanging">              <t hangText="Name:">                sync-token              </t>              <t hangText="Namespace:">                DAV:              </t>              <t hangText="Purpose:">                The synchronization token provided by the server and returned by the client.              </t>              <t hangText="Description:">                See <xref target="sync-collection" />.              </t>            </list>          </t>          <figure>            <artwork><![CDATA[<!ELEMENT sync-token CDATA><!-- Text MUST be a URI -->]]>            </artwork>          </figure>      </section>      <section title="DAV:multistatus XML Element" anchor="multistatus_element">          <t>            <list style="hanging">              <t hangText="Name:">                multistatus              </t>              <t hangText="Namespace:">                DAV:              </t>              <t hangText="Purpose:">                Extends the DAV:multistatus element to include synchronization details.              </t>              <t hangText="Description:">                See <xref target="sync-collection" />.              </t>            </list>          </t>          <figure>            <artwork><![CDATA[<!ELEMENT multistatus (DAV:response*, DAV:responsedescription?,                       sync-token?) ><!-- DAV:multistatus originally defined in RFC 4918, Section 14.16     but overridden here to add the DAV:sync-token element --><!-- DAV:response defined in RFC 4918, Section 14.24 --><!-- DAV:responsedescription defined in RFC 4918, Section 14.25 -->]]>            </artwork>          </figure>      </section>    </section>    <section title='Security Considerations'>      <t>      	Servers MUST take care to limit the scope of DAV:sync-collection requests so that clients cannot use excessive server resources by executing, for example, a Depth:infinity report on the root URI. For example, <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV</xref> servers might only support the DAV:sync-collection report on user calendar home collections, and prevent use of the report on the parent resource of all calendar homes (assuming there is one). That way each individual user's request is scoped to changes only within their own calendar home and not across the entire set of calendar users.      </t>      <t>        Beyond the above considerations, this extension does not introduce any new security concerns than those already described in HTTP and WebDAV.      </t>    </section>    <section title='IANA Considerations'>      <t>        This document does not require any actions on the part of IANA.      </t>    </section>    <section title='Acknowledgments'>      <t>        The following individuals contributed their ideas and support for writing this specification: Bernard Desruisseaux, Werner Donne, Mike Douglass, Ciny Joy, Andrew McMillan, Julian Reschke, and Wilfredo Sanchez.
