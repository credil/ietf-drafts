Internet-Draft            Request-URI delivery              January 2008


1.  Introduction

   draft-rosenberg-sip-ua-loose-route-01 [8] describes use-cases where
   the Request-URI is re-written by one or more entities in the
   signaling path towards the terminating UA, potential problems if the
   previous Request-URI is lost, and defines a new mechanism where the
   Request-URI is not re-written for translation/rerouting cases.
   Instead in these translation/rerouting cases the Request-URI is kept
   unchanged, and a new route is instead inserted into a Route header.
   In case of a retarget operation, still the Request URI is rewritten
   as this implies that the request is targeted at another identity.

   This draft describes issues with the mechanism proposed in [8] and
   describes an alternative solution, which do not have the same issues.
   The alternative is based on a new SIP header.  Key of the alternative
   solution is that it is backward compatible and do not change the
   existing routing logic.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].


3.  Issues with the mechanism proposed in
    draft-rosenberg-sip-ua-loose-route-01

   Some issues have been identified with the mechanism described in [8].

   The main issue with the mechanism proposed in [8] is that it requires
   that an entity using the solution knows whether the next physical hop
   also supports the solution.

   In addition, if previous entities in the signaling path have used the
   mechanism, and an entity realizes that the next hop does not support
   it, it must "fix" the message (putting the correct value back into
   the R-URI etc) in order for that next hop to be able to process and
   route the message correctly.

   Also, services which rely on receiving entities having knowledge
   about the "previous" R-URI will only work if entities (which have
   nothing to do with the service as such) in the message path support
   the mechanism, which makes the usage of such services very limited
   and unpredictable.

   The reason for being required to know whether the next hop supports

   the mechanismis that the mechanism makes a backward incompatible
   change to the core routing mechanism of SIP.

   Some examples of scenarios where the application of the mechanism
   proposed in [8] will make the SIP routing fail:
   1.  Intermediate proxy that does not support the mechanism:
       1.  Receives a Route header with one entry representing the
           proxy.d
       2.  It will remove the Route entry.d
       3.  It will try to route based on the Request URI, using RFC 3263
           [3] procedures.  It will find the first proxy that the target
           identity resolves to.d
       4.  We have a loop back to the first proxy that the target
           normally resolves to.d
       5.  Routing failed
   2.  Home proxy that does not support the mechanism:
       1.  Receives a Route header with one entry representing the
           proxy.
       2.  It will remove the Route entry.
       3.  It will look at the Request URI to see if it is a registered
           AOR, it is not.
       4.  It will try to route based on the Request URI, using RFC 3263
           [3] procedures.  It will find the first proxy that the target
           identity resolves to.
       5.  We have a loop back to the first proxy that the target
           normally resolves to.
       6.  Routing failed
   3.  An MGC that receives the request that is routed in such manner
       may find a URN in the Request URI, it can not interwork this so
       the call setup fails.


4.  Overview of operation

4.1.  General

   This chapter describes an alternative mechanism for solving the
   problem described in [8].

4.2.  Alternative: Target header

   The alternative is based on the usage of a new SIP header.  Within
   this document we call the header "Target", but a better name can be
   chosen should the group decide to adopt this alternative.

   If a SIP entity supporting this extension re-writes the Request URI
   value, then:




Holmberg & van Elburg     Expires July 14, 2008                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            Request-URI delivery              January 2008


   o  if the re-write is due to a retarget operation, then the proxy
      MUST remove any existing Target header; or
   o  if the re-write is due to a re-route or translation operation and
      the request does not contain a Target header field, then the proxy
      MUST insert a Target header field with the value of the Request
      URI before it was rewritten.

   If a SIP entity, which acts as registrar/home proxy for the
   terminating user, re-writes the Request-URI with the contact address
   of the registered UA it may additionally insert a P-Called-Party-ID
   header field with the previous value of the Request-URI , as
   described in RFC3455 [5].

   Note that the Target header field and P-Called-Party-ID header fields
   have different semantics, where the Target header field represents
   the initial target identity that was used to initiate a session to
   the target, the P-Called-Party-ID represents the last AOR used to
   reach the user before Request-URI value for cases where the last
   route taken presents significant information.

4.3.  Advantages of alternative mechanism

   The alternative mechanism in this document can be used towards any
   proxy/terminating UA.  There is no need for entities using the
   mechanism to have knowledge whether the next hop supports it, and
   there is no need for the terminating UA to inform its home proxy
   whether it supports the mechanism or not.

   In case one of the proxies that is traversed in the course of routing
   does not understand the mechanism, routing will still succeed as the
   routing mechanism of SIP itself is not changed.  The worst thing that
   can happen is that a terminating UA gets the wrong information about
   the intended target identity by which it has been reached.

   The mechanism in this document is fully backward compatible with MGCs
   that are using the Request-URI value for mapping and routing towards
   the PSTN network, according to the interworking procedures described
   in RFC3398 [4], 3GPP TS 29.163 [7] and ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5.

   The mechanism in this document is fully compatible with the
   mechanisms described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [6], which specifies the SIP
   signaling procedures for the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).

4.4.  Use-cases

4.4.1.  General

   This chapter describes how the alternative mechanism defined in this
   draft can be used to solve the use-cases listed in [8], using the
   proposed new Target header.  It is also indicated whether the
   P-Called-Party-ID header can be used to solve a specific use-case.

4.4.2.  Unknown Aliases

   P-Called-Party-ID [5] header field was introduced just to address
   this scenario.

   The new Target header field would also solve this use-case.

4.4.3.  Unknown GRUU

   As this is just a variant of the "Unknown Aliases" problem, P-Called-
   Party-ID [5] clearly addresses this.

   The new Target header field would also solve this use-case, for
   GRUU's used as initial target.  The new Target header might miss
   cases where a proxy equipped with some user policy may decide to
   route an incoming call to a specific GRUU of that same user.  This is
   clearly not a retargeting case.

4.4.4.  Limited Use Addresses

   As this is just a variant of the "Unknow Aliases" problem, P-Called-
   Party-ID [5] clearly addresses this.

   The new Target header field would also solve this use-case.

4.4.5.  Sub-Addressing

   As this is just a variant of the "Unknown Aliases" problem, P-Called-
   Party-ID [5] clearly addresses this.

   The new Target header field would also solve this use-case, for sub
   addresses used as initial target.  The new Target header might miss
   cases where a proxy equipped with some user policy may decide to
   route an incoming call to a specific sub address of that same user.
   Considering this a retargeting case would be justified if this case
   can be distinguished.

4.4.6.  Service Invocation

   The new Target header field would solve this use-case as it will
   retain the original URI containing all the service invocation

   information.

4.4.7.  Emergency Services

   The new Target header field would solve this use-case as it will
   retain the emergency URN.

4.4.8.  Freephone Numbers

   The new Target header field would solve this use-case as it will
   retain the Freephone Number.

4.4.9.  Conclusion

   Analysis of the use-cases in this section shows that the new Target
   header field can be used to solve the use-cases.  Some use-cases can
   also be solved using the P-Called-Party-ID header.

4.5.  Usage of P-Called-Party-ID

   Analysis in this document shows that a new Target header field can be
   used to solve the use cases in [8].  It is noted that due to the
   difference in semantics between the P-Called-Party-ID and the Target
   header, at least 3GPP IMS would also need to continue to use
   P-Called-Party-ID.  However both mechanisms can exist in parallel.

   It has been claimed that it would be difficult to specify a generic
   mechanism using an existing P- header, since it is not defined in a
   standards track RFC.  If needed, that can be fixed in IETF, and we
   consider this more an "administrative exercise" than a technical
   problem.


5.  Security Considerations

   The mechanism in this draft reveals to the UA the target address by
   which it was contacted.  Previously, this was hidden from the UA.  It
   may be possible that a UA is not permitted to know the address at
   which it was contacted.  In such cases, the home proxy SHOULD remove
   the header which contains the address.
