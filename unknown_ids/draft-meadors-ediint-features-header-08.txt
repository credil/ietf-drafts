                        EDI-INT Features Header
                draft-meadors-ediint-features-header-08

Abstract

   With the maturity of the EDI-INT standards of AS1, AS2 and AS3,
   applications and additional features are being built upon the basic
   secure transport functionality.  These features are not necessarily
   supported by all EDI-INT applications and could cause potential
   problems with implementations.  The EDIINT Features header provides a
   means to resolve these problems and support new functionality.

Internet-Draft           EDI-INT Features Header               June 2010


1.  Introduction

   EDI-INT applications provide for a secure means of payload document
   transport.  The original intent was for transport of a single EDI or
   XML document.  However, as AS1 [RFC3335], AS2 [RFC4130] and AS3
   [RFC4823] matured, other features and application logic were
   implemented upon EDI-INT standards.  Since these features go beyond
   but do not violate the basic premise of EDI-INT, a means is needed to
   communicate to trading partners features which are supported by the
   originating user agent.  The EDIINT Features header indicates the
   capability of the user agent to support the listed feature with its
   trading partner without out-of-band communication and agreement.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  EDIINT Features Header Syntax

   The EDIINT Features header can appear in the header section of an
   AS1, AS2 and AS3 message.  Its ABNF [RFC5234] syntax is listed below.

   Feature = "EDIINT-Features:" [WSP] Feature-Name *([WSP] "," [WSP]
   Feature-Name)

   Feature-Name = 1*Feature-Token

   Feature-Token= %d48-57 / ; 0-9
                  %d65-90 / ; A-Z
                  %d97-122 / ; a-z
                  "-" ; blank space " " is not allowed

   The Feature-Token allows for feature names to be specified and can
   only contain alphanumeric characters along with the hyphen.  Feature
   names are case-insensitive.


3.  Implementation and Processing

   The EDIINT Features header indicates the originating user agent is
   capable of supporting the features listed.  The EDIINT Features
   header MUST be present in all messages transmitted by the user agent
   and not just messages which utilize the feature.  Upon examination of
   the EDIINT Features header, the trading partner SHOULD assume the
   user agent is capable of receiving messages utilizing any of the

   features listed.

   The features listed MUST be supported by IETF RFC standards.  These
   standards MUST describe the feature name which is listed in the
   header and the means which it should be used.


4.  EDI-INT Applications

   AS2 and AS3 applications currently use a version header, AS2-Version
   and AS3-Version, respectively, to indicate functional support.  The
   EDIINT Features header tremendously improves the purpose and function
   of the old version header.  However, to provide a connection from the
   old version header and the EDIINT Features header, AS2 and AS3
   applications which implement the EDIINT Features header MUST use the
   version value of "1.2" to indicate the support of the EDIINT Features
   header.  Also, since version "1.1" indicates the implementation
   supports compression [RFC5402] and "1.2" builds upon "1.1", AS2-
   Version or AS3-Version of "1.2" MUST support compression regardless
   of whether it is mentioned as a feature in the EDIINT Features
   header.

   AS1 does not use a version header and one is not required for
   including the EDIINT-Features header.

   The EDIINT Features header is informational and AS1, AS2 or AS3
   trading partners who have not implemented it can safely ignore this
   header.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This is a request for a provisional header registration.

   Header field name: EDIINT-Features

   Applicable protocol: http and mail

   Status: provisional

   Author/Change controller: IETF

   Specification document(s): https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/
   draft-meadors-ediint-features-header/

   Related information: This header will be used in conjection with the
   EDIINT WG specifications RFC 4130 (AS2), RFC 3335 (AS1) and RFC 4823
   (AS3).

6.  Security Considerations

   Because headers are often un-encrypted, it may be possible for the
   EDIINT Features header to be altered.  Trading partners MAY consult
   out-of- band to confirm feature support.
