    <abstract>
      <t>According to RFC 3046, there is only one DHCP Option 82 allowed in a
      certain DHCP message. This document describes several cases that need
      more than one Relay Agent to add link information. Proposed method is to
      have different Relay Agents add multiple DHCP Option 82.</t>

    <section anchor="Intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>In a typical DSL access network, DHCP Relay Agent Option is used to
      carry the access loop identification, which identifies the access loop
      of the user and is useful for troubleshooting and policy management
      functions. In FTTC/FTTB scenarios of PON system, there are multiple
      subscribers behind an ONU and both OLT and ONU's slot/port information
      are needed to identify a use accurately. However, a DHCP Relay Agent
      does NOT add a "second" relay agent option, when it receives a DHCP
      packet with a Relay Agent Information option already present from a
      trusted circuit, according to chapter 2.1 of <xref
      target="RFC3046"></xref>.</t>

      <t>As described in<xref target="draft-huang-dhc-relay-ps-00"></xref>,
      when a layer 3 switch is installed for a 20 floor building and a layer 2
      switch is installed at each floor inside this building, there is a
      policy delivery problem if only one relay agent inserts access loop
      identification.</t>

      <t>If we define a new sub-option, DHCP Relay Agents appending access
      loop identification to existing DHCP Option 82 will have to identify the
      information inserted by other Relay Agents previously, which is
      complicated. Another reason not to do so, is that some options can't be
      changed because of the signature. Define a new option x is also a bad
      choice because of incompatibility with legacy device.</t>

      <t>What is proposed is to insert multiple DHCP Option 82 to a DHCP
      packet. Stacking DHCP Option 82 is much simpler and is able to void the
      problems mentioned above.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Design"
             title="Multi-level Access Loop Identification Scenarios">
      <t>There are at least two cases where multi-level access loop
      identification is needed to be carried in DHCP packets.</t>

      <t>A typical PON FTTB/FTTC network includes OLT, ONU and ODN, as
      depicted in figure 1. ONU can be Multi-Dwelling Unit (MDU) or
      Multi-Tenant Unit (MTU). In this case, ONU provides network access for
      multiple residential users or multiple business users via DSL or
      Ethernet typically. In order to locate a user precisely from a DHCP
      message via Option 82, ONU need add a user's access loop identification
      on which port the user is attached, while OLT need add PON port where
      the ONU is attached. Therefore, two DHCP Relay Agents reside in ONU and
      OLT respectively.</t>

      <t>Another case is cascaded LAN system, which port information of
      multi-level LAN switches is needed to locate a user. There is more
      information of this case in<xref
      target="draft-huang-dhc-relay-ps-00"></xref>. Figure 2 depicts an
      example of this case. Both curb switch and floor switch need add access
      loop identifier to DHCP Option 82. That means there are two levels of
      DHCP Relay Agents.</t>

    <section anchor="specification" title="Stacking DHCP Option 82 Syntax">
      <t>There is no change to the syntax specified in <xref
      target="RFC3046"></xref>(DHCP Relay Agent Information Option) in a
      Type-Length-Value format.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Agent Operation">
      <t>A trusted circuit of a DHCP Relay Agent is attached by a trusted
      downstream (closer to client) network element, which is between the
      current DHCP Relay Agent and the client. The current DHCP Relay Agent
      MAY add a DHCP relay agent option but not set the giaddr field. In the
      case of multi-level DHCP Relay Agent, the current DHCP Relay Agent can
      add a "second" relay agent option to a DHCP packet that has a DHCP relay
      agent option which was added by a trusted DHCP Relay Agent attached to
      the trusted circuit. The DHCP packet will further be forwarded per
      normal DHCP relay agent operations, setting the giaddr field as it deems
      appropriate.</t>

      <t>A DHCP relay agent adding a Relay Agent Information field SHALL
      always add it as the last option (but before 'End Option' 255, if
      present) in the DHCP options field of any recognized BOOTP or DHCP
      packet. When there are multiple DHCP Option 82 in a packet, the options
      should be arranged in the order of time sequence.</t>

      <t>The Relay Agent Information option echoed by a server MUST be removed
      by either the relay agent or the trusted downstream network element
      which added it when forwarding a server-to-client response back to the
      client. If there are multiple DHCP Option 82 in a DHCP packet, Option 82
      added previously will become the last option (but before 'End Option'
      255, if present) in the DHCP options field after last option82 is
      striped.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Applicability">
      <t>Option 82 stacking is practicable in the scenario of multiple Relay
      Agents between DHCP client and DHCP server. Multiple Relay Agents are
      especially common in FTTB/FTTC with PON or multi-level switches based
      access network.</t>
