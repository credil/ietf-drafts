            Specifying Local Civic Address Fields in PIDF-LO
               draft-winterbottom-geopriv-local-civic-03

Abstract

   A backwardly-compatible mechanism for adding locally significant
   civic address elements to the Geopriv civic address format is
   described.  A formal mechanism for handling unsupported extensions
   when translating between XML and DHCP civic address forms is defined
   for entities that need to perform this translation.

Internet-Draft                 Local Civic                  October 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Geopriv civic location specifications ([RFC4776], [RFC5139])
   define an XML and binary representtations for civic addresses that
   allow for the expression of civic addresses in most countries.
   Guidance for the use of these formats for the civic addresses in
   different countries is included in [RFC5774].

   Subsequent to these specifications being produced, use cases for
   locally significant civic address elements have emerged.  These
   elements do not all readily fit existing elements, as recommended in
   [RFC5774].  These elements are also sufficiently domain-specific that
   they do not merit additions to the limited space available for
   globally recognized elements.

   The XML format for civic addresses [RFC5139] provides a mechanism
   that allows for the addition of standardized or privately understood
   elements.  A similar facility for private extension is not provided
   for the DHCP format [RFC4776], though new specifications are able to
   define new CAtypes (civic address types).

   A recipient of a civic address in either format currently has no
   option than to ignore elements that it does not understand.  Where a
   recipient performs a translation between the two formats, this
   results in the unsupported elements being discarded.  In order for a
   new extension to be useful to a recipient that performs translation,
   the recipient has to understand the extension and know how to
   correlate an XML element with a CAtype.

   This document defines a method that allows the specification of civic
   address elements with private or local significance.  How these are
   defined and used in both XML and DHCP formats is described.  This
   document also describes how a recipient can translate unsupported
   civic addresses between the two formats.

   The additions described in this document are backwardly compatible.
   Furthermore, they allow for a civic address to be translated without
   loss of information.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Specifying Local Civic Elements

   The civic schema in [RFC5139] defines an ordered structure of
   elements that can be combined to describe a civic address.  The XML
   extension point at the bottom of the schema is used to include
   address elements of local significance into the main civic body.

   New elements are defined in a new XML namespace [XMLNS].  This is
   true of address elements with significance within private or
   localized domains, as well as those that are intended for global
   applicability.

   For example, suppose the (fictitious) Central Devon Canals Authority
   wishes to introduce a new civic element called "bridge".  The
   authority defines an XML namespace that includes a "bridge" element.
   The namespace needs to be a unique URI, for example
   "http://devon.canals.org.uk/civic".

   A civic address that includes the new "bridge" element is shown in
   Figure 1.

      <civicAddress xml:lang="en-GB"
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr"
           xmlns:cdc="http://devon.canals.org.uk/civic">
        <country>UK</country>
        <A1>Devon</A1>
        <A3>Monkokehampton</A3>
        <RD>Deckport</RD>
        <STS>Cross</STS>

        <cdc:bridge>21451338</cdc:bridge>

      </civicAddress>

                   Figure 1: Local Civic Object Example

   An entity that receives this location information might not
   understand the locally specified address element.  As long as the
   added element is able to be safely ignored, the remainder of the
   civic address can be used.  The result is that the information is not
   as useful as it could be, but the added element does not prevent the
   use of the remainder of the address.

   The address can be passed to other applications, such as a LoST
   server [RFC5222], without modification.  If the application
   understands the added elements, it is able to make use of that
   information.  For example, if this civic address is acquired using
   HELD [RFC5985], it can be included in a LoST request directly.

4.  Translating Unsupported Elements

   Unsupported civic address elements can be carried without consequence
   only as long as the format of the address does not change.  When
   converting between the XML and DHCP formats, these unsupported
   elements are necessarily discarded: the entity performing the
   translation has no way to know the correct element to use in the
   target format.

4.1.  DHCP to XML Format Translation

   The registration of a new CAtype following the process in [RFC4776]
   means that a recipient is potentially unable to produce a complete
   XML representation of the DHCP civic address.

   To address this, a new "EXT" XML element is defined that allows the
   XML format to carry an unsupported CAtype without modification.  This
   type extends the base civic address element type by adding a "CAtype"
   attribute that identifies the CAtype.

   For example, if CAtype 199 is defined, but not understood, this is
   carried in the XML format as shown in Figure 2.

      <civicAddress xml:lang="en-GB"
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr"
        xmlns:ext="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr:ext">
        <country>UK</country>
        <A1>Devon</A1>
        <A3>Monkokehampton</A3>
        <RD>Deckport</RD>
        <STS>Cross</STS>

        <ext:EXT CAtype="199">21451338</ext:EXT>

      </civicAddress>

          Figure 2: XML Civic Address with Unsupported Extension

   No facility is provided for the conversion of private or local use
   CAtypes when translating from DHCP to XML.  Extensions for private or
   local use do not use new CAtypes.  Private or local use extensions
   MUST be defined using the XML extension mechanism.

4.2.  XML to DHCP Format Translation

   Extensions to the XML format are defined in a new XML namespace.
   Extensions that have global applicability might have a specific
   CAtype allocated.  Extensions that are only for private or local use

   have no corresponding CAtype and always use this translation
   mechanism.

   Unsupported extensions in the XML format can be added to a DHCP
   format civic address using two new elements: the Namespace CAtype and
   the Element CAtype.

4.2.1.  Namespace CAtype

   The "Namespace" CAtype (CAtype XX [IANA/RFC-Editor: please use
   assigned value]) provides the definition of an XML namespace and a
   corresponding namespace prefix.  This is analogous to attributes
   beginning with "xmlns" in [XMLNS].

   The Abstract Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] for this CAtype uses a
   Unicode character as the basic element and borrows BNF definitions
   from [XMLNS]:

      ns-CAtype      = Prefix "=" *UCHAR
      UCHAR          = <any Unicode character>

   The Namespace CAtype is sent multiple times if elements from multiple
   namespaces are required.

4.2.2.  Element CAtype

   The "Element" CAtype (CAtype YY [IANA/RFC-Editor: please use assigned
   value]) conveys a single element and its value.  The element name
   includes a namespace prefix, as bound by the "Namespace" CAtype, plus
   the local name from the corresponding XML element.  This is followed
   by the value of the element.  Prefix and local name are separated by
   a colon (":") as in [XMLNS]; element name and value are separated by
   an equals sign ("=").

   The Abstract Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] for this CAtype uses a
   Unicode character as the basic element and borrows BNF definitions
   for "Prefix" and "LocalPart" from [XMLNS]:

      element-CAtype = Prefix ":" LocalPart "=" *UCHAR

   An Element CAtype that includes a prefix that has not been bound in a
   Namespace CAtype is ignored.

4.2.3.  Conversion Constraints

   This conversion only works for elements that have textual content and
   an optional "xml:lang" attribute.  Elements with complex content or
   other attributes - aside from namespace bindings - MUST be ignored if

Internet-Draft                 Local Civic                  October 2010


   they are not understood.

   A Namespace CAtype MUST precede the Element CAtype that uses the
   binding it defines.  A Namespace CAtype MUST NOT reuse a prefix.  To
   aid in client parsing and reduce the likelihood of server
   configuration errors, all Namespace CAtypes SHOULD proceed any
   Element CAtypes.

4.2.4.  Conversion Example

   The following example civic address contains two private use
   extensions:

      <civicAddress xml:lang="en-US"
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr"
           xmlns:post="http://postsoftheworld.net/ns/posts"
           xmlns:ap="http://www.example.com/airport/5.0">
        <country>US</country>
        <A1>CA</A1>

        <post:lamp>2471</post:lamp>
        <post:pylon>AQ-374-4(c)</post:pylon>

        <ap:airport>LAX</ap:airport>
        <ap:terminal>Tom Bradley</ap:terminal>
        <ap:concourse>G</ap:concourse>
        <ap:gate>36B</ap:gate>
      </civicAddress>

              Figure 3: XML Example with Multiple Extensions

   Might be converted to the DHCP form as follows:

      country     = US
      CAtype[0]   = en-US
      CAtype[1]   = CA
      CAtype[XX]  = post=http://postsoftheworld.net/ns/posts
      CAtype[XX]  = ap=http://www.example.com/airport/5.0
      CAtype[YY]  = post:lamp=2471
      CAtype[YY]  = post:pylon=AQ-374-4(c)
      CAtype[YY]  = ap:airport=LAX
      CAtype[YY]  = ap:terminal=Tom Bradley
      CAtype[YY]  = ap:concourse=G
      CAtype[YY]  = ap:gate=36B

4.2.5.  Migration to Registered Elements

   An element that is initially added as a local extension might be
   recognized as being more widely applicable.  In this case, a CAtype
   might be allocated for this extension.  Depending on whether a client
   is aware of the CAtype allocation, they could convert the XML form
   differently.  A recipient that understands a CAtype MUST treat the
   extended form as being semantically equivalent.

   For example, if the bridge element from the examples in Figure 1 and
   Figure 2 is allocated a CAtype of 199, a recipient treats all of the
   four following forms as equivalent:

      <cdc:bridge
        xmlns:cdc="http://devon.canals.org.uk/civic">
        21451338
      </cdc:bridge>

      <ext:EXT CAtype="199"
        xmlns:ext="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr:ext">
        21451338
      </ext:EXT>

      CAtype[XX]  = canal=http://devon.canals.org.uk/civic
      CAtype[YY]  = canal:bridge=21451338

      CAtype[199] = 21451338


5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a formal way to extend the existing Geopriv
   civic schema.  No security threats are introduced by this document.

   Security threats applicable to the civic address formats are
   described in [RFC4776] (DHCP) and [RFC5139] (XML).


6.  IANA Considerations

   Two civic address types are registered for the DHCP format.  An XML
   namespace and schema are registered for the XML format in accordance
   with guidelines in [RFC3688].

6.1.  CAtype Registration

   This document registers two civic address types in the "CAtypes"
   registry established by [RFC4776].  The following CAtypes are added:

Appendix A.  Identifying EXT Elements in LoST Validation

   LoST [RFC5222] uses the name of civic address elements to identify
   them when validating the content of an address.  An "EXT" element can
   appear multiple times, each one with a different "CAtype" attribute
   to distinguish it.  In this case, a LoST response is unable to
   distinguish between one "EXT" element and another.  In order to
   identify a specific "EXT" element, the CAtype is also needed.

   To deal with this problem, a set of pseudo-elements are defined.
   These pseudo-elements exist in the
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr:ext" namespace, like
   the "EXT" element, but are not defined in the corresponding schema.
   The local name of each of these elements is formed from the string
   "CAtype" plus the decimal value of the "CAtype" attribute.  This
   pseudo-element name is included in addition to the "EXT" element
   name.

   For instance, a civic address might contain the following "EXT"
   elements:

      <ext:EXT CAtype="199">21451338</ext:EXT>
      <ext:EXT CAtype="231">Rubbish</ext:EXT>

   These can be identified in a LoST response as follows:

    <locationValidation xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lost1"
        xmlns:ext="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr:ext">
      <valid>ext:EXT ext:CAtype199</valid>
      <invalid>ext:EXT ext:CAtype231</invalid>
    </locationValidation>
