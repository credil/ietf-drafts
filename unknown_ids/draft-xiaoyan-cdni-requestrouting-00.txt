    1. Introduction

       CDNI request routing includes the following two scenarios:

       Scenario A: request routing for user initiated requests, where 
       once the upstream CDN receives the user request (DNS or HTTP),
       upstream CDN communicates with a downstream CDN to get the 
       address of a delivery node to serve the user.

       Scenario B: request routing for content acquisition, where the
       selected delivery node in downstream CDN receives the

       user's request and encounters a cache miss, and communicates with
       upstream CDN to select a delivery node to acquire the content.

       From procedure perspective, both iterative and recursive request
       routing are to be supported by CDNI solution as per requirement
       draft [I-D.draft-lefaucheur-cdni-requirements] (requirements R33
       and R34 in version -01).

       From protocol perspective, either DNS or HTTP[RFC2616] can be 
       used for request routing.

       Therefore, we can have four solution combinations for each
       scenario, see table below.

       Document [I-D.draft-peterson-cdni-strawman] gives a discussion on
       iterative routing using DNS. The present document discusses
       recursive request routing procedures using DNS or HTTP.

       Note: According to the proposed charter and current (individual)
       requirement document for CDNI, interfaces inside CDN are out of
       scope of CDNI, i.e. interactions

    Internet-Draft          CDNI Request Routing              June 2011


       between a delivery node and RR in the downstream CDN during 
       content acquisition should not be specified in CDNI; hence
       this document does not describe that interface in detail.

    2. Conventions used in this document

       The two terms "Iterative CDNI request routing" and "Recursive 
       CDNI request routing" in this document are to be interpreted 
       as defined in [I-D .draft-lefaucheur-cdni-requirements].

    3. Request routing

    3.1. Scope definition

         This document focuses on Recursive CDNI request routing. For
         convenience, definition for recursive CDNI request routing from
         [I-D .draft-lefaucheur-cdni-requirements] is copied as below.

            o Recursive CDNI request routing: When an Upstream CDN 
            elects to redirect a request towards a Downstream CDN, the
            Upstream CDN can query the Downstream CDN Request Routing 
            system via the CDNI Request Routing protocol (or use 
            information cached from earlier similar queries) to find out
            how the Downstream CDN wants the request to be redirected, 
            which allows the Upstream CDN to factor in the Downstream 
            CDN response when redirecting the user agent. 
            This approach is referred to as "recursive" CDNI request 
            routing. Note that the Downstream CDN may elect to
            have the request redirected directly to a Surrogate inside 
            the Downstream CDN, to the Request-Routing System of the 
            Downstream CDN, to another CDN, or to any other system that
            the Downstream CDN sees as fit for handling the redirected 
            request.

         Other "recursive" mechanisms also utilized in CDNI, but not for
         interactions of RRs during request routing procedures such as 
         the local DNS's role in DNS lookup, are not in the scope of 
         this document.

    3.2. Protocol considerations on routing procedure

         Two main protocols can be used for CDNI recursive request 
         routing, i.e. HTTP or DNS. The present document obeys a 
         principle that the protocol utilized between two RR systems
         keeps same as that utilized between the end user and the first
         touched RR to simplify the RR implementation.

    3.3. Domain Name examples

       There are several domain names involved in this document, below 
       are their examples and explanations.

       1. video.cp.example

       In this document, a content provider with domain name cp.example
       contracts with a CDN provider. Domain name video.cp.example
       represents the specific sub domain to be accelerated by the
       contracted CDN.

       Generally, the authoritative DNS server of domain 
       video.cp.example has a record pointing to a domain of the 
       contracted CDN,in order to direct the relevant DNS requests to 
       that CDN.

       A contractual CDN may ingest content from the contracted content
       provider in advance or dynamically. However, the ingestion
       procedures are out of scope of CDNI and therefore not described
       in this draft.

       2. cdn.op-x.example

       Operator X with domain name op-x.example provides CDN services
       using sub domain name cdn.op-x.example. This CDN-domain
       augmented with a prefix "peer" used to identify the request it
       received is from a peer CDN rather than from end users.

    3.4. Operation codes considerations

         In case of HTTP signaling used between RRs of connected CDNs, 
         as one CDN may act as a downstream peer and an upstream peer 
         for different CPs at the same time, it's possible that a CDN
         receives requests from other interconnected CDNs for different
         purposes. e.g.selecting a delivery node for an end user or 
         selecting a delivery node holding the content for a downstream
         peer. Therefore the CDN needs to distinguish these requests 
         to act correspondingly.

         Operation code "CDNIRoutereq" and "CDNIContentlocate" contained 
         in the URL of HTTP requests is used for this purpose in the 
         present document.

    Internet-Draft          CDNI Request Routing              June 2011


    3.5. Client location's availability

       To select the most appropriate delivery node ultimately to serve 
       for an end user, usually the user's location is taken into 
       account by the downstream CDN. Therefore, the user's IP address
       or FQDN should be conveyed to the downstream CDN from the 
       upstream peer during CDNI request routing.

       In case of HTTP redirection, the upstream CDN can get the 
       specific IP address of the end user. It is proposed the 
       upstream CDN convey this IP address or construct a FQDN to 
       the downstream CDN for optimal routing decision.

       In case of DNS redirection, the upstream CDN may obtain the end
       user's IP address through the DNS client subnet extension or by
       embedding the client IP address in the DNS name
       [I-D.vandergaast-edns-client-subnet]. It is
       proposed that the upstream CDN forwards this info to the 
       downstream CDN directly for optimal routing decision. If the UE
       does not support this DNS extension, the upstream CDN therefore
       will not convey sort of this extension to its down peer. It is 
       proposed that the downstream CDN returns the request router's 
       address. After that the specific HTTP request for content will be 
       sent to the request router,at this point, the request router can 
       elect a more accurate delivery node for the user based on its IP 
       address.

    4. Configuration summary

       Interconnection CDNs must exchange the following information to 
       peer with each other:

       o  The IP address of the entry point of the CDN or distinguished 
          CDN domain name; and

       o  Set of IP prefixes for which the CDN is prepared to deliver
          to end-users.

       o  Set of CP domain names for which the CDN is served.


       When a Request Router in an upstream sees an end-user IP address 
       best served by a downstream peer, upstream CDNs needs to forward 
       the request to the configured entry point of the downstream peer,
       or to result of DNS lookup for the configured downstream CDN's 
       domain name.

       When a delivery node in a downstream receives content requests 
       from end users and result in cache miss, it verifies that the
       CP domain

    Internet-Draft          CDNI Request Routing              June 2011


       contained in the URL is served by a known CDN peer based on
       configuration, and if so, issues a content acquisition request to
       that peer.

    5. Request routing approaches

    5.1. First approach

       This alternative utilizes HTTP redirection between the end user 
       and the upstream CDN. On reception of HTTP request, the upstream
       CDN communicates directly with selected downstream CDN to get a 
       delivery node.

                  Figure 1: Request routing for approach one

       1.  A Request Router of CDN A processes the DNS request for
           its customer and recognizes that the end-user is best
           served by another CDN. CDN A returns the IP address of
           its Request Router to get the HTTP request of the user.

    Internet-Draft          CDNI Request Routing              June 2011


       Note: The domain name in step1 of the CP e.g.video.cp.example
       should be changed to the CDN A's when the request is
       redirected to CDN A. For simplicity, this is not shown in
       the figure.

       2.  A Request Router of CDN A processes the HTTP request and
           again recognizes that the end-user is best served by
           another CDN, so based on the configuration and result of
           a potential DNS lookup, CDN A issues an HTTP POST to CDN
           B's Request Router, with the distinguished CDN b's
           domain name and a command code "CDNIRoutreq" contained
           in the URL. The command code is used to explicitly
           indicate this is a request from a peer for delivery node
           selection. Other parameters e.g.the end user's IP address
           and the CP's domain name shall be included in the body of
           the HTTP POST.

       3.  CDN B's Request Router recognizes the request is from a
           peer CDN, if the end user's IP is included, it selects
           and returns a suitable delivery node for the user based
           on its location. The address of this node is returned to
           the end user via CDN A.
           Based on local policy, CDN B may return the request
           router's address instead of that of a delivery node.

       4.  The end-user requests the content from CDN B's delivery
           node, potentially resulting in a cache miss.  From the
           URL CDN B verifies that this CP-domain served by a known
           peer. It then sends a HTTP POST with a command code
           "CDNILocatecontent" and CDN A's distinguished domain
           name contained in the URL to CDN A's Request Router.
           Other parameters such as playback URL of the content
           shall be included in the body of the HTTP POST.
           If the CDN B's Request Router address is returned
           in step 3, the content request will first arrive at CDN
           B's Request Router and a 302 response with the address
           of the selected delivery node will be sent back to the end
           user.

       5.  CDN A recognizes that the HTTP request is from a peer
           CDN rather than an end-user based on the command code and so
           returns address of a delivery node.

       6.  CDN A serves content for the requested CDN-domain.

    5.2. Second approach

       This approach utilizes DNS redirection between an end user and 
       the upstream CDN. On reception of DNS lookup request, the 
       upstream CDN communicates directly with the selected downstream

                  Figure 2: Request routing for approach two

       1.  A Request Router of CDN A processes the DNS request for
           its customer and recognizes that the end-user is best
           served by another CDN.  The client IP used in this
           determination is obtained either through the DNS client
           subnet extension or by embedding the client IP in the
           DNS name [I-D.vandergaast-edns-client-subnet]. Based on
           configuration, the Request Router changes the domain
           name to CDN B's distinguished name and forwards the DNS
           request to CDN B's Request Router.

       2.  CDN B's Request Router recognizes the request is from a
           peer CDN based on the distinguished domain name, it
           returns a suitable delivery node. The address of this
           node is returned to the end user via CDN A. Or based on
           local policy or CDN B did not get the address of the client
           in step 1, CDN B may return the address of the Request
           Router.

       3.  The end-user requests the content from CDN B's delivery
           node, potentially resulting in a cache miss.  From the
           URL CDN B verifies that this CP is served by a known peer.
           It then issues an HTTP POST with command code
           "CDNILocatecontent" and CDN A's distinguished domain
           name contained in the URL to CDN A's Request Router.
           Other parameters such as playback URL of the content
           shall be included in the body of the HTTP POST.
           If the CDN B's Request Router address is returned
           in step2, the content request will first arrive at CDN
           B's Request Router and a 302 response with the address
           of selected delivery node will be sent back to the end
           user.

       4.  CDN A recognizes that the HTTP request is from a peer
           CDN rather than an end-user from the command code and so
           returns the address of a delivery node.

       5.  CDN A serves content for the requested CDN-domain.

6. Conclusions

   Priorities for proposed approaches in present document will be 
   worked out later based on discussion on the email list.


7.  Security Considerations

    For the above recursive request routing approach two, the 
    user agent may determine to convey its IP address to the CDN 
    by including its IP address in the DNS client subnet extension
    or embedding the IP address in the DNS name 
    [I-D.vandergaast-edns-client-subnet] for optimizing the routing.
    
 
    In case of CDNI, if RFC1918 address space is utilized by the 
    end user, it should be avoided to pass this RFC1918 address 
    across the addressing boundary as the downstream CDN may also 
    use the overlapping RFC 1918 address space. 
 
    A possible approach for this is once the upstream CDN 
    aware the IP address of the end user contained in the 
    DNS extension is an RFC1918 address, it shall
    change this address to the global unique IP address of the 
    local DNS for the end user from the IP packet header and transfer
    this address to the downstream peer. The downstream CDN then may
    select a delivery node for the user based on the local DNS's 
    address or just return the RR's address to the upstream CDN.

8.  IANA Considerations

    If the approach described in this document is adopted, we would
    request that IANA allocate the command codes "CDNIRoutereq"
    and "CDNIContentlocate" in the HTTP Parameters registry.
