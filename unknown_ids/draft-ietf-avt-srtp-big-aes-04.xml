<section title="Introduction">
<t>
This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
<xref target="FIPS197"/> with 192 and 256 bit keys within the Secure
RTP protocol <xref target="RFC3711"/>.  Below those block ciphers are
referred to as AES-192 and AES-256, respectively, and the use of AES
with a 128 bit key is referred to as AES-128.  This document describes
Counter Mode encryption for SRTP and SRTCP and appropriate SRTP Key
Derivation Functions for AES-192 and AES-256.  It also defines new
cryptosuites that use these new functions.
</t>
<t>
While AES-128 is widely regarded as more than adequately secure, some
users may be motivated to adopt AES-192 or AES-256.  One motivation is
conformance to the Suite B profile (which requires AES-256 for the
protection of TOP SECRET information) <xref target="suiteB"/>.  Others
may be motivated by a perceived need to purse a highly conservative
security strategy; see <xref target="Security"/> for more discussion
of security issues.
</t>
<t>
The crypto functions described in this document are an addition to, and not
a replacement for, the crypto functions defined in <xref target="RFC3711"/>.

Section 4.1.1 of <xref target="RFC3711"/> defines AES counter mode
encryption, which it refers to as AES_CM.  
<!--
(Note that AES_CM conforms
to the NIST definition of counter mode <xref target="NISTmodes"/>,
which is designated as CTR; RFC 3711 was written prior to that
publication, though it was published afterwards.) 
--> This definition applies to all of the AES key sizes.  In this
note, AES-192 counter mode and AES-256 counter mode and are denoted as
AES_192_CM and AES_256_CM respectively.  In both of these ciphers, the
plaintext inputs to the block cipher are formed as in AES_CM, and the
block cipher outputs are processed as in AES_CM.  The only difference
in the processing is that AES_192_CM uses AES-192, and AES_256_CM uses
AES-256.  Both AES_192_CM and AES_256_CM use a 112-bit salt as an
input, as does AES_CM.
</t>
<t>
For the convenience of the reader, the structure of the counter blocks
in SRTP counter mode encryption is illustrated in <xref target="CMfig"/>,
using the terminology from Section 4.1.1 of <xref target="RFC3711"/>.
In this diagram, the symbol (+) denotes the bitwise exclusive-or operation, and
the AES encrypt operation uses AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256 for
AES_CM, AES_192_CM, and AES_256_CM, respectively.  The field labeled
b_c contains a block counter, the value of which increments once for
each invocation of the "AES Encrypt" function.
</t>
<!--
<t>
 A keystream segment SHALL be the concatenation of the 128-bit output
   blocks of the AES cipher in the encrypt direction, using key k = k_e,
   in which the block indices are in increasing order.  Symbolically,
   each keystream segment looks like

      E(k, IV) || E(k, IV + 1 mod 2^128) || E(k, IV + 2 mod 2^128) ...

   where the 128-bit integer value IV SHALL be defined by the SSRC, the
   SRTP packet index i, and the SRTP session salting key k_s, as below.

      IV = (k_s * 2^16) XOR (SSRC * 2^64) XOR (i * 2^16)

   Each of the three terms in the XOR-sum above is padded with as many
   leading zeros as needed to make the operation well-defined,
   considered as a 128-bit value.

<section anchor="KDF" title="The AES_192_CM_PRF and AES_256_CM_PRF Key Derivation Functions">
<t>
Section 4.3.3 of <xref target="RFC3711"/> defines an AES counter mode
key derivation function, which it refers to as AES_CM PRF (and
sometimes as AES-CM PRF).  (That specification uses the term PRF, or
pseudo-random function, interchangeably with the phrase "key
derivation function". )
<!--
(Note that AES_CM conforms
to the NIST definition of counter mode <xref target="NISTmodes"/>,
which is designated as CTR; RFC 3711 was written prior to that
publication, though it was published afterwards.) 
--> This key derivation function can be used with any AES key size.
In this note, the AES-192 counter mode PRF and AES-256 counter mode
PRF are and are denoted as AES_192_CM_PRF and AES_256_CM_PRF
respectively.  In both of these PRFs, the plaintext inputs to the
block cipher are formed as in the AES_CM PRF, and the block cipher
outputs are processed as in the AES_CM PRF.  The only difference in
the processing is that AES_192_CM_PRF uses AES-192, and AES_256_CM_PRF
uses AES-256.  Both AES_192_CM_PRF and AES_256_CM_PRF use a 112-bit
salt as an input, as does the AES_CM PRF.

For the convenience of the reader, the structure of the counter blocks
in SRTP counter mode key derivation is illustrated in
<xref target="KDFfig"/>, using the terminology from Section 4.3.3 of
<xref target="RFC3711"/>.  In this diagram, the symbol (+) denotes the

AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256 for the AES_CM PRF, AES_192_CM_PRF, and
AES_256_CM_PRF, respectively.  The field "LB" contains the 8-bit
constant "label" which is provided as an input to the key derivation
function (and which is distinct for each type of key generated by that
function).  The field labeled b_c contains a block counter, the value
of which increments once for each invocation of the "AES Encrypt"
function.

<section anchor="IV" title="Usage Requirements">
<t>
When AES_192_CM is used for encryption, AES_192_CM SHOULD be used as
the key derivation function, and AES_128_CM MUST NOT be 
used as the key derivation function.
</t>
<t>
When AES_256_CM is used for encryption, AES_256_CM SHOULD be used as
the key derivation function.  Both AES_128_CM and AES_192_CM MUST NOT
be used as the key derivation function.
</t>
<t>
<list>
<t>
Rationale: it is essential that the cryptographic strength of the key
derivation meets or exceeds that of the encryption method.  
It is natural to use the same function for both encryption and
key derivation.  However, it is not required to do so
because it is desirable to allow these ciphers to be used
with alternative key derivation functions that may
be defined in the future.

<section anchor="cryptosuites" title="Crypto Suites">
<t>
This section defines SRTP crypto suites that use the ciphers and key
derivation functions defined in this document.  These suites are
registered with IANA for use with the SDP Security Descriptions
attributes (Section 10.3.2.1 of
<xref target="RFC4568"/>).  Other SRTP key
management methods that use the crypto functions defined in this
document are encouraged to also use these crypto suite definitions.
<list>
<t>
Rationale: the crypto suites use the same authentication function that
is mandatory-to-implement in SRTP, HMAC-SHA1 with a 160 bit key.
HMAC-SHA1 would accept larger key sizes, but when it is used with keys
larger than 160 bits, it does not provide resistance to cryptanalysis
greater than that security level, because it has only 160 bits of
internal state.  By retaining 160-bit authentication keys, 
the crypto suites in this note have more compatibility with existing
crypto suites and implementations of them.

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>
AES-128 provides a level of security that is widely regarded as being
more than sufficient for providing confidentiality.  It is believed
that the economic cost of breaking AES-128 is significantly higher
than the cost of more direct approaches to violating system security,
e.g. theft, bribery, wiretapping, and other forms of malfeasance.
</t>
<t>
Future advances in the state of the art of cryptanalysis could
eliminate this confidence in AES-128, and motivate the use of AES-192
or AES-256.  AES-192 is regarded as being secure even against some
adversaries for which breaking AES-128 may be feasible.  Similarly,
AES-256 is regarded as being secure even against some adversaries for
which it may be feasible to break AES-192.  The availability
of the larger key size versions of AES provides a fallback plan
in case of unanticipated cryptanalytic results.
</t>
<t>
It is conjectured that AES-256 provides adequate security even against
adversaries that possess the ability to construct a quantum computer
that works on 256 or more quantum bits.  No such computer is known to
exist; its feasibility is an area of active speculation and research.
</t>
<t>
Despite the apparent sufficiency of AES-128, some users are interested
in the larger AES key sizes.  For some applications, the 40% increase
in computational cost for AES-256 over AES-128 is a worthwhile bargain
when traded for the security advantages outlined above.  These
applications include those with a perceived need for very high
security, e.g.  due to a desire for very long-term confidentiality.
</t>
<t>
As with any cipher, the conjectured security level of AES may change
over time.  The considerations in this section reflect the best
knowledge available at the time of publication of this document.
</t>
<t>
It is desirable that AES_192_CM and AES_192_CM_PRF be used with an
authentication function that uses a 192 bit key, and that AES_256_CM
and AES_256_CM_PRF be used with an authentication function that uses a
256 bit key.  However, this desire is not regarded as
security-critical.  Cryptographic authentication is resilient against
future advances in cryptanalysis, since the opportunity for a forgery
attack against a session closes when that session closes.  For this
reason, this note defines new ciphers, but not new authentication
functions.

<section title="AES_256_CM_PRF Test Cases">
<t>
   This section provides test data for the AES_256_CM_PRF key
   derivation function, which uses AES-256 in Counter Mode.  In the
   following, we walk through the initial key derivation for the
   AES-256 Counter Mode cipher, which requires a 32 octet session
   encryption key and a 14 octet session salt, and the HMAC-SHA1
   authentication function, which requires a 20-octet session
   authentication key.  These values are called the cipher key, the
   cipher salt, and the auth key in the following.  Since this is the
   initial key derivation and the key derivation rate is equal to
   zero, the value of (index DIV key_derivation_rate) is zero
   (actually, a six-octet string of zeros).  In the following, we
   shorten key_derivation_rate to kdr.
</t>
<t>
   The inputs to the key derivation function are the 32 octet master key
   and the 14 octet master salt:

      master key:  f0f04914b513f2763a1b1fa130f10e29

      master salt: 3b04803de51ee7c96423ab5b78d2
</artwork>
</figure>
   We first show how the cipher key is generated.  The input block for
   AES-256-CM is generated by exclusive-oring the master salt with the
   concatenation of the encryption key label 0x00 with (index DIV
   kdr), then padding on the right with two null octets (which
   implements the multiply-by-2^16 operation, see Section 4.3.3 of RFC
   3711).  The resulting value is then AES-256-CM- encrypted using the
   master key to get the cipher key.

   Next, we show how the cipher salt is generated.  The input block for
   AES-256-CM is generated by exclusive-oring the master salt with the
   concatenation of the encryption salt label.  That value is padded and
   encrypted as above.

   We now show how the auth key is generated.  The input block for
   AES-256-CM is generated as above, but using the authentication key
   label.

<t>
It may be desirable to eliminate AES-192 altogether, leaving users
with the simpler choice of using AES-128 or AES-256.  This option
preserves the possibility of Suite B conformance.  Given that the 
incremental computational cost of AES-256 over AES-192 is only
16%, and the additional key storage overhead is only 33%, 
this option imposes only a minimal burden on implementations.
</t>

<!--
<t>
It may be desirable to use AES in the Chained Message Authentication
Code (CMAC) mode of operation <xref target="CMAC"/> in conjunction
with the ciphers defined in this document, with the CMAC key size
matching the counter mode key size.  This mode of operation can be
used as a replacement for HMAC-SHA1, and that use would provide an
authentication function with security that is directly comparable to
AES-192 and AES-256.  This mode of operation has some additional
benefits and may be worth considering for secure RTP.
