                This document introduces four schemes that provide a per-packet authentication and 
		integrity service in the context of the ALC and NORM protocols.
		The first scheme is based on digital signatures.
		Because it relies on asymmetric cryptography, this scheme generates a high processing
		load at the sender and to a lesser extent at a receiver, as well as a significant
		transmission overhead.
		It is therefore well suited to low data rate sessions.
		The second scheme relies on the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
		If this approach also relies an asymmetric cryptography, the processing load
		and the transmission overhead are significantly reduced compared to traditional
		digital signature schemes.
		It is therefore well suited to medium data rate sessions.
		The third scheme relies on a group Message Authentication Code (MAC).
		Because this scheme relies on symmetric cryptography, MAC calculation and verification
		are fast operations, which makes it suited to high data rate sessions.
		However it only provides a group authentication and integrity service, which means
		that it only protects against attackers that are not group members.
		Finally, the fourth scheme merges the digital signature and group group schemes,
		and is useful to mitigate DoS attacks coming from attackers that are not group members.

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>
Many applications using multicast and broadcast communications
require that each receiver be able to authenticate the source of any
packet it receives to check check its integrity.
For instance, ALC <xref target="RMT-PI-ALC"/> and NORM <xref target="RMT-PI-NORM"/>
are two Content Delivery Protocols (CDP) designed to transfer reliably
objects (e.g. files) between a session's sender and several receivers.
</t>

<t>
The NORM protocol is based on bidirectional transmissions.
Each receiver acknowledges data received or, in case of packet erasures,
asks for retransmissions.
On the opposite, the ALC protocol defines unidirectional transmissions.
Reliability can be achieved by means of cyclic transmissions of the content
within a carousel, or by the use of proactive Forward Error Correction codes
(FEC), or by the joint use of these mechanisms.
Being purely unidirectional, ALC is massively scalable, while NORM is
intrinsically limited in terms of the number of receivers that can
be handled in a session.
Both protocols have in common the fact that they operate at application
level, on top of an erasure channel (e.g. the Internet) where packets
can be lost (erased) during the transmission.
</t>

<t>
With these CDP, an attacker might impersonate the ALC or NORM
session sender and inject forged packets to the receivers, thereby
corrupting the objects reconstructed by the receivers.
An attacker might also impersonate a NORM session receiver and
inject forged feedback packets to the NORM sender.
</t>

<t>
In case of group communications, several solutions exist to provide
the receiver some guaranties on the integrity of the packets it
receives and on the identity of the sender of these packets.
These solutions have different features that make them more or
less suited to a given use case:
<list style='symbols'> 
	<t>digital signatures <xref target="RFC4359"/>:
		this scheme is well suited to low data rate flows, when a
		true packet sender authentication and packet integrity service
		is needed.
		However, digital signatures based on RSA asymmetric cryptography
		is limited by high computational costs and high transmission overheads.
		The use of ECC ("Elliptic Curve Cryptography") significantly relaxes
		these constraints, especially when seeking for higher security levels.
		For instance, the following key sizes provide equivalent
		security: 1024 bit RSA key versus 160 bit ECC key, or
		2048 bit RSA key versus 224 bit ECC key.
<!--
		For instance, the following key size provide equivalent
		security:
		<texttable>
		<ttcol align="center">Symmetric Key Size</ttcol>
		<ttcol align="center">RSA Key Size</ttcol>
		<ttcol align="center">ECC Key Size</ttcol>

		<c>80 bits</c>
		<c>1024 bits</c>
		<c>160 bits</c>

		<c>112 bits</c>
		<c>2048 bits</c>
		<c>224 bits</c>
		</texttable>
-->
	</t>
	<t>group Message Authentication Codes (MAC):
		this scheme is well suited to high data rate flows, when
		transmission overheads must be minimized.
		However this scheme cannot protect against attacks coming from
		inside the group, where a group member impersonates the sender
		and sends forged messages to other receivers.
	</t>
	<t>TESLA (Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication)
		<xref target="RFC4082"/><xref target="MSEC-TESLA"/>:
		this scheme is well suited to high data rate flows, when
		transmission overheads must be minimized, and when a
		true packet sender authentication and packet integrity service
		is needed.
		The price to pay is an increased complexity, in particular the
		need to loosely synchronize the receivers and the sender, as
		well as the need to wait for the key to be disclosed before
		being able to authenticate a packet.
	</t>
</list>

<t>
Several authentication schemes MAY be used in the same ALC or NORM session,
even on the same communication path.
Since all the above schemes make use of the same authentication header extension mechanism
(<xref target="sec:signature_auth_he_format"/>, <xref target="sec:group_mac_auth_he_format"/>,
<xref target="sec:combined_auth_he_format"/>) and <xref target="MSEC-TESLA"/>, section 5.1),
the same 4-bit "ASID" (Authentication Scheme IDentifier) has been reserved
in all the specifications.
The association between the "ASID" value and the actual authentication
scheme is defined at session startup and communicated to all the group members
by an out-of-band mechanism.
</t>


<section title="Scope of this Document">
<!-- ------------------------------------ -->

<t>
<xref target="MSEC-TESLA"/> explains how to
use TESLA in the context of ALC and NORM protocols.
</t>

<t>
The current document specifies the use of 
the Digital Signature based on RSA asymmetric cryptography, the Elliptic
Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)  and Group MAC schemes.
The current document also specifies the joint use of Digital Signature
and Group MAC schemes which is useful to mitigate DoS attacks coming
from attackers that are not group members.
</t>

<t>
Unlike the TESLA scheme, this specification considers the authentication/integrity
of the packets generated by the session's sender as well as those generated
by the receivers (NORM).
</t>

<t>
All the applications build on top of ALC and NORM
directly benefit from the source authentication and packet
integrity services defined in this document.
For instance this is the case of  the FLUTE application
<xref target="RMT-FLUTE"/> built on top of ALC.
</t>

<t>
The current specification assumes that several parameters
(like keying material) are communicated out-of-band, sometimes
securely, between the sender and the receivers.
This is detailed in <xref target="signature_params"/> and
<xref target="group_mac_params"/>.

<section title="RSA Digital Signature Scheme">
<!-- ==================================== -->

<section title="Principles" anchor="sec:signature_principles">
<!-- ------------------------------------ -->

<t>
The computation of the digital signature, using K_priv, MUST include the ALC or NORM header (with the
various header extensions) and the payload when applicable.
The UDP/IP/MAC headers MUST NOT be included.
During this computation, the "Signature" field MUST be set to 0.
</t>
<t>
Upon receiving this packet, the receiver recomputes the Group MAC, using K_pub, and compares
it to the value carried in the packet.
During this computation, the Weak Group MAC field MUST also be set to 0.
If the check fails, the packet MUST be immediately dropped.
</t>

<t>
Several "Signature Encoding Algorithms" can be used, including
RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 and RSASSA-PSS.
With these encodings, several "Signature Cryptographic Function"
can be used, like SHA-256.
</t>

<t>
First, let us consider a packet sender.
More specifically, from <xref target="RFC4359"/>:
digital signature generation is performed as described in
<xref target="RFC3447"/>, Section 8.2.1 for RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 and
Section 8.1.1 for RSASSA-PSS.
The authenticated portion of the packet is used as the message M,
which is passed to the signature generation function.
The signer's RSA private key is passed as K.
In summary (when SHA-256 is used), the signature generation process computes
a SHA-256 hash of the authenticated packet bytes, signs the SHA-256 hash using
the private key, and encodes the result with the specified RSA encoding type.
This process results in a value S, which is the digital signature to
be included in the packet.
</t>

<t>
With RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 and RSASSA-PSS signatures,
the size of the signature is equal to the "RSA modulus", unless the "RSA modulus"
is not a multiple of 8 bits. In that case, the signature MUST be prepended with
between 1 and 7 bits set to zero such that the signature is a multiple of 8 bits
<xref target="RFC4359"/>.
The key size, which in practice is also equal to the "RSA modulus", has major security
implications.
<xref target="RFC4359"/> explains how to choose this value depending on the maximum
expected lifetime of the session.
This choice is out of the scope of this document.
</t>


<t>
Now let us consider a receiver.
From <xref target="RFC4359"/>:
Digital signature verification is performed as described in
<xref target="RFC3447"/>, Section 8.2.2 (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5) and
<xref target="RFC3447"/>, Section 8.1.2 (RSASSA-PSS).
Upon receipt, the digital signature is passed to the
verification function as S.
The authenticated portion of the packet is used as the message M,
and the RSA public key is passed as (n, e).
In summary (when SHA-256 is used), the verification function computes a SHA-256
hash of the authenticated packet bytes, decrypts the SHA-256 hash in
the packet using the sender's public key, and validates that the appropriate
encoding was applied.
The two SHA-256 hashes are compared and if they are identical the
validation is successful.
</t>


</section>


<section title="Parameters" anchor="signature_params">
<!-- ------------------------------------ -->

<t>
Several parameters MUST be initialized by an out-of-band mechanism.
The sender or group controller:
<list style='symbols'>
<t>	MUST communicate his public key, for each receiver to
	be able to verify the signature of the packets received.
	As a side effect, the receivers also know the key length, n_k,
	and the signature length, the two parameters being equal;</t>
<t>	MAY communicate a certificate (which also means
	that a PKI has been setup), for each receiver to be able to
	check the sender's public key;</t>
<t>	MUST communicate the Signature Encoding Algorithm.
	For instance, <xref target="RFC3447"/> defines the
	RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 and RSASSA-PSS algorithms that are usually
	used to that purpose;</t>
<t>	MUST communicate the Signature Cryptographic Function,
	for instance SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512.
	Because of security threats on SHA-1, the use of SHA-256
	is RECOMMENDED;</t>
<t>	MUST associate a value to the "ASID" field
	(Authentication Scheme Identifier) of the EXT_AUTH header extension
	(<xref target="sec:signature_auth_he_format"/>);</t>
</list>
These parameters MUST be communicated to all receivers before they can
authenticate the incoming packets. For instance it can be communicated in
the session description, or initialized in a static way on the receivers,
or communicated by means of an appropriate protocol.
The details of this out-of-band mechanism are out of the scope of this
document.
</t>

</section>


<section title="Authentication Header Extension Format" anchor="sec:signature_auth_he_format">
<!-- ------------------------------------ -->

<t>
The integration of Digital Signatures is similar in ALC and NORM and relies on the 
header extension mechanism defined in both protocols.
More precisely this document details the EXT_AUTH==1 header extension defined
in <xref target="RFC5651"/>.
</t>

<!--
<t>
<list><t>----- Editor's note:
	All authentication schemes using the EXT_AUTH header extension MUST
	reserve the same 4 bit "ASID" field after the HET/HEL fields.
	This way, several authentication schemes can be used in the same ALC
	or NORM session, even on the same communication path.

EXT_AUTH header extension when using 128 byte (1024 bit) key digital signatures

<section title="Principles" anchor="sec:group_mac_principles">
<!-- ------------------------------------ -->

<t>
The computation of the Group MAC, using K_g, includes the ALC or NORM header (with the various header
extensions) and the payload when applicable.
The UDP/IP/MAC headers are not included.
During this computation, the Weak Group MAC field MUST be set to 0.
Then the sender truncates the MAC output to keep the n_m most significant bits
and stores the result in the Group MAC Authentication header. 
</t>
<t>
Upon receiving this packet, the receiver recomputes the Group MAC, using K_g, and compares
it to the value carried in the packet.
During this computation, the Group MAC field MUST also be set to 0.
If the check fails, the packet MUST be immediately dropped.
</t>

<t>
<xref target="RFC2104"/> explains that it is current practice to truncate the MAC
output, on condition that the truncated output length, n_m be not less than half
the length of the hash and not less than 80 bits.
However, this choice is out of the scope of this document.

<section title="Combined Use of the RSA/ECC Digital Signatures and Group MAC Schemes">
<!-- ==================================== -->

<section title="Principles" anchor="sec:combined_use_principles">
<!-- ------------------------------------ -->


<t>
In some situations, it can be interesting to use both authentication
schemes.
The goal of the Group MAC is to mitigate DoS attacks coming from attackers
that are not group members <xref target="RFC4082"/> by adding a light authentication
scheme as a front-end.
</t>

<t>
More specifically, before sending a message, the sender sets the
Signature field and Group MAC field to zero.
Then the sender computes the Signature as detailed in <xref target="sec:signature_principles"/>
or in <xref target="sec:ecc_signature_principles"/> and stores the value in the Signature field.
Then the sender computes the Group MAC as detailed in <xref target="sec:group_mac_principles"/>
and stores the value in the Group MAC field.
The (RSA or ECC) digital signature value is therefore protected by the Group MAC, which
avoids DoS attacks where the attacker corrupts the digital signature itself.
</t>

<t>
Upon receiving the packet, the receiver first checks the Group MAC, as
detailed in <xref target="sec:group_mac_principles"/>.
If the check fails, the packet MUST be immediately dropped.
Otherwise the receiver checks the Digital Signature, as detailed
in <xref target="sec:signature_principles"/>.
If the check fails, the packet MUST be immediately dropped.
</t>

<t>
This scheme features a few limits:
<list style='symbols'>
<t>the Group MAC is of no help if a group member (who knows K_g) impersonates
	the sender and sends forged messages to other receivers. DoS attacks are
	still feasible;</t>
<t>it requires an additional MAC computing for each packet,
	both at the sender and receiver sides;</t>
<t>it increases the size of the authentication headers.
	In order to limit this problem, the length of the truncated output of the
	MAC, n_m, SHOULD be kept small (see <xref target="RFC3711"/> section 9.5).
	In the current specification, n_m MUST be a multiple of 32 bits, and
	default value is 32 bits.
	As a side effect, with $n_m = 32$ bits, the authentication service is
	significantly weakened since the probability that any packet be successfully
	forged is one in 2^32.
	Since the Group MAC check is only a pre-check that is followed
	by the standard signature authentication check, this is not
	considered to be an issue.</t>
</list>
For a given use-case, the benefits brought by the Group MAC must be balanced
against these limitations.

For instance <xref target="fig:combined_auth_he_with_1024b_sig"/> shows the combined
Digital Signature/Group MAC
EXT_AUTH header extension when using 128 byte (1024 bit) key RSA digital signatures
(which also means that the signature field is 128 byte long).
The EXT_AUTH header extension is then 136 byte long.

<section title="Security Considerations">
<!-- ==================================== -->

<section title="Dealing With DoS Attacks">
<!-- =================================== -->

<t>
Digital signatures introduces new opportunities for an attacker to mount DoS attacks.
For instance an attacker can try to saturate the processing
capabilities of the receiver (faked packets are easy to create but checking
them requires to compute a costly digital signature).
</t>

<t>
In order to mitigate these attacks, it is RECOMMENDED to use the combined
Digital Signature/Group MAC scheme (<xref target="sec:combined_use_principles"/>).
However, no mitigation is possible if a group member acts as an attacker.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Dealing With Replay Attacks">
<!-- =================================== -->

<t>
Replay attacks consist for an attacker to store a valid message and to replay
it later on.
</t>


<section title="Impacts of Replay Attacks on the Simple Authentication Schemes">
<!-- =================================== -->

<t>
Since all the above authentication schemes are memoryless, replay attacks
have no impact on these schemes.
</t>

</section>


<section title="Impacts of Replay Attacks on NORM">
<!-- =================================== -->

<t>
We review here the potential impacts of a replay attack on the NORM component.
Note that we do not consider here the protocols that could be used along with
NORM, for instance the congestion control protocols.
</t>

<t>
First, let us consider replay attacks within a given NORM session.
NORM defines a "sequence" field that can be used to protect against replay
attacks <xref target="RMT-PI-NORM"/> within a given NORM session.
This "sequence" field is a 16-bit value that is set by the message
originator (sender or receiver) as a monotonically increasing number
incremented with each NORM message transmitted.
It is RECOMMENDED that a receiver check this sequence field and drop messages considered
as replayed.
Similarly, it is RECOMMENDED that a sender check this sequence, for each known receiver,
and drop messages considered as replayed.
In both cases, checking this sequence field SHOULD be done before
authenticating the packet: if the sequence field has not been
corrupted, the replay attack will immediately be identified, and
otherwise the packet will fail the authentication test.
This analysis shows that NORM itself is robust in front of replay attacks
within the same session.
</t>

<t>
Now let us consider replay attacks across several NORM sessions.
A host participation in a NORM session is uniquely identified by
the {"source_id"; "instance_id"} tuple.
Therefore, when a given host participates in several NORM sessions, it is
RECOMMENDED that the "instance_id" be changed for each NORM instance.
It is also RECOMMENDED, when the Group MAC authentication/integrity check
scheme is used, that the shared group key, K_g, be changed across sessions.
Therefore, NORM can be made robust in front of replay attacks across different
sessions.
</t>


</section>


<section title="Impacts of Replay Attacks on ALC">
<!-- =================================== -->

<t>
We review here the potential impacts of a replay attack on the ALC component.
Note that we do not consider here the protocols that could be used along with
ALC, for instance the layered or wave based congestion control protocols.
</t>
<t>
First, let us consider replay attacks within a given ALC session:
<list style='symbols'> 
	<t>Regular packets containing an authentication tag: a replayed message
	containing an encoding symbol will be detected once authenticated, thanks to
	the object/block/symbol identifiers, and will be silently discarded.
	This kind of replay attack is only penalizing in terms of memory and
	processing load, but does not compromise the ALC behavior.
	</t>
	<t>Control packets containing an authentication tag:
	ALC control packets, by definition, do not include any encoding symbol
	and therefore do not include any object/block/symbol identifier that would
	enable a receiver to identify duplicates.
	However, a sender has a very limited number of reasons to send control packets.
	More precisely:
	<list style='symbols'> 
		<t>At the end of the session, a "close session" (A flag) packet is sent.
		Replaying this packet has no impact since the receivers already left.</t>
		<t>Similarly, replaying a packet containing a "close object" (B flag)
		has no impact since this object is probably already marked as closed
		by the receiver.</t>
	</list>
	</t>
</list>
This analysis shows that ALC itself is robust in front of replay attacks
within the same session.
</t>

<t>
Now let us consider replay attacks across several ALC sessions.
An ALC session is uniquely identified by the {sender's IP address; 
Transport Session Identifier (TSI)} <xref target="RFC5651"/>.
Therefore, when a given sender creates several sessions, it is
RECOMMENDED that the TSI be changed for each ALC instance.
It is also RECOMMENDED, when the Group MAC authentication/integrity check
scheme is used, that the shared group key, K_g, be changed across sessions.
Therefore, ALC can be made robust in front of replay attacks across different
sessions.
