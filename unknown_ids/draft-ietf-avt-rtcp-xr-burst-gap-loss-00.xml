   This document defines an RTCP XR Report Block that allows the
   reporting of Burst and Gap Loss metrics for use in a range of RTP applications.

<section anchor='intro' title="Introduction">
<section anchor='intro1' title="Burst and Gap Loss Report Block">
<t>
   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined
   in <xref target='RFC3611'/> for use in a range of RTP applications.
   The new block type supports the reporting of the proportion of packets lost by the network. The 
losses during loss bursts are reported, together with the number of bursts and additional data allowing 
the calculation of statistical parameters (mean and variance) of the distribution of burst lengths. Some uses of these metrics
depend on the availability of the metric "cumulative number of packets lost" from RTCP <xref target='RFC3550'/>.
</t>
<t>
   This block provides information on transient IP problems.
   Burst/Gap metrics are typically used in Cumulative reports however
   MAY be used in Interval reports.
The burstiness of packet loss affects user
experience, may influence any sender strategies to mitigate the problem, and may also have diagnostic value.
</t>
<t>
The metric belongs to the class of transport-related terminal metrics defined in [MONARCH] (work in progress).
</t>
<t>
   The definitions of Burst, Gap, Loss and Discard are consistent with definitions in
   <xref target='RFC3611'/>, with the clarification that Loss
   and Discard are defined in terms of frames.  To accomodate the range of jitter buffer
   algorithms and packet discard logic that may be used by implementors,
   the method used to distinguish between bursts and gaps may be an
   equivalent method to that defined in <xref target='RFC3611'/>.  The method used SHOULD
   produce the same result as that defined in <xref target='RFC3611'/> for conditions of
   burst packet loss, but MAY produce different results for conditions
   of time varying jitter.
</t>
<t>
Instances of this Metrics Block refer by tag to the separate auxiliary Measurement Identity block 
<xref target='MEASIDENT'/> which contains information 
such as the SSRC of the measured stream, and RTP sequence numbers and time intervals indicating the span of the report.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor='intro2' title="RTCP and RTCP XR Reports">
<t>
   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in <xref target='RFC3550'/>. 
   <xref target='RFC3611'/> defined an extensible structure for reporting using
   an RTCP Extended Report (XR).  This draft defines
   a new Extended Report block that MUST be used as defined in
   <xref target='RFC3550'/> and <xref target='RFC3611'/>.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor='intro3' title="Performance Metrics Framework">
<t>
   The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target='PMOLFRAME'/> provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  Metrics
   described in this draft either reference external definitions
   or define metrics generally in accordance with the guidelines
   in <xref target='PMOLFRAME'/>.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor='intro4' title="Applicability">
<t>
This metric is believed to be applicable to the large class of RTP applications which contain jitter buffers.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor='definitions' title='Definitions'>

<t>Received, Lost and Discarded</t>
<t><list style='empty'><t>
   A packet shall be regarded as lost if it fails to arrive within an
   implementation-specific time window.  A packet that arrives within
   this time window but is too early or late to be played out shall be
   regarded as discarded.  A packet shall be classified as one of
   received (or OK), discarded or lost.
</t><t>
   If Voice Activity Detection is used the Burst and Gap Duration shall
   be determined as if silence frames had been sent, i.e. a period of
   silence in excess of Gmin frames MUST terminate a burst condition.
</t></list></t>
<t>Bursts and Gaps</t>
<t><list style='empty'><t>
   The terms Burst and Gap are used in a manner consistent with that of
   RTCP XR <xref target='RFC3611'/>.  RTCP XR views a call as being divided into
   bursts, which are periods during which the 
   loss rate is high enough to cause noticeable call quality
   degradation (generally over 5 percent loss rate), and gaps,
   which are periods during which lost packets are
   infrequent and hence call quality is generally acceptable.
</t><t>
   The recommended value for the threshold Gmin in <xref target='RFC3611'/> results in a Burst being
   a period of time during which the call quality is degraded to a
   similar extent to a typical PCM Severely Errored Second.

<section anchor='blockdef2' title="Definition of Fields in Burst/Gap Loss Report Block">
<t>
   block type (BT): 8 bits
</t>
<t>
<list style='empty'>
<t>
         A Burst/Gap Loss Report Block is identified by the constant 
         NBGL. 
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
[Note to RFC Editor: please replace NBGL with the
         IANA provided RTCP XR block type for this block.]
</t>
<t>
   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit
</t>
<t>
<list style='empty'>
<t>
This field is used to indicate whether the Burst/Gap Loss metric is an Interval or a Cumulative metric, 
that is, whether the reported value applies to the most 
recent measurement interval duration between successive metrics reports (I=1) (the Interval Duration) or to the accumulation period 
characteristic of cumulative 
measurements (I=0) (the Cumulative Duration). Numerical values for both these intervals are provided in the Measurement Identifier block 
referenced by the tag field below.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
   Measurement Identifier association (tag): 3 bits
</t>
<t>
<list style='empty'>
<t>
This field is used to identify the Measurement Identifier block <xref target='MEASIDENT'/> which describes this measurement. The relevant 
Measurement Identifier block has the same tag value as the Burst/Gap Loss block. Note that there may be 
more than one Measurement Identifier block per RTCP packet.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
   Reserved (resv): 4 bits
</t>
<t>
<list style='empty'>
<t>
These bits are reserved. They SHOULD be set to zero by senders and MUST be ignored by receivers.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
   block length: 16 bits

is equal to 4.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Threshold: 8 bits
</t>
<t>
<list style='empty'>
<t>
   The Threshold is equivalent to Gmin in <xref target='RFC3611'/>, i.e. the number of
   successive frames that must be received prior to
   and following a lost frame in order for this lost frame to be regarded as part of a gap.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Sum of Burst Durations (ms): 24 bits
</t>
<t>
<list style='empty'>
<t>
   The total duration of bursts of lost frames in the period of the report (Interval or Cumulative).
</t><t>
   If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE SHOULD be
   reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the measurement
   is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFF SHOULD be reported.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Packets lost in bursts: 24 bits
</t>
<t>
<list style='empty'>
<t>
   The total number of packets lost during loss bursts.
</t>
<t>
   If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE SHOULD
   be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
   measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFF SHOULD be reported.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Total packets expected in bursts: 24 bits
</t>
<t>
<list style='empty'>
<t>
   The total number of packets expected during loss bursts (that is, the sum of received packets and lost packets).
</t>
<t>
   If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE SHOULD
   be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
   measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFF SHOULD be reported.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Number of bursts: 16 bits
</t>
<t>
<list style='empty'>
<t>
The number of bursts in the period of the report (Interval or Cumulative).
</t>
<t>
   If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
   reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the measurement
   is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Sum of Squares of Burst Durations (ms-squared): 36 bits
</t>
<t>
<list style='empty'>
<t>
The sum of the squares of burst durations (where individual burst durations are expressed in ms) over in the period of the 
report (Interval or Cumulative). The units for this quantity are milliseconds-squared.
</t>
<t>
   If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFFE SHOULD be
   reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the measurement
   is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFFF SHOULD be reported.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>
<section anchor='calcs' title="Derived metrics based on reported metrics">
<t>
The metrics described here are intended to be used as described in this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement 
Identity block 
(which MUST be present in the same RTCP packet as the Burst/Gap Loss block) and also with the metric 
"cumulative number of packets lost" provided in standard RTCP <xref target='RFC3550'/>.
</t>
<t>
The fraction of packets lost during bursts is the quotient:
Packets Lost in Bursts / Total Packets expected in Bursts
</t><t>
The fraction of packets lost during gaps is the quotient:
(number of packets lost - Packets Lost in Bursts) / (Packets Expected - Total Packets expected in Bursts)
</t><t>
where "number of packets lost" is obtained from standard RTCP <xref target='RFC3550'/> and Packets Expected 
is calculated as the difference between "extended last sequence number" and "extended first sequence number" (Interval or 
Cumulative) provided in the Measurement Identity block <xref target='MEASIDENT'/> associated with this Burst/Gap Loss block. 
</t>
<t>
Note that if the metric is to be calculated on an Interval basis, a difference must be taken between the current and 
preceding values of "cumulative number of packets lost" in RTCP, to obtain the "number of packets lost" for the reporting 
interval.
</t>
<t>
The mean burst duration is obtained as the quotient:
</t><t>
mean = Sum of Burst Durations / Number of Bursts
</t><t>
The variance of the burst duration is obtained using the standard result:
</t><t>
var = ( Sum of Squares of Burst Durations - Number of Bursts * mean^2 ) / (Number of Bursts - 1)
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor='sdp' title="SDP Signaling">
<t>
   <xref target='RFC3611'/> defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol) 
   <xref target='RFC4566'/> for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used without
   prior signaling.
</t>
<t>
   This section augments the SDP <xref target='RFC4566'/> attribute "rtcp-xr" defined in 
   <xref target='RFC3611'/> by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to signal the use of the report
   block defined in this document. 
</t><t>
     rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF
</t><t>
     (defined in <xref target='RFC3611'/>)
</t><t>
     xr-format = xr-format / 
                xr-bgl-block
</t><t>
     xr-bgl-block   = "xr-bgl"
</t>
</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>   
   This document creates a new block type within the IANA "RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry" called the Burst/Gap Loss Block, and a new
   parameter xr-bgl within the "RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry".
</t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in <xref target='RFC3611'/>.  This block does not provide 
   per-packet statistics so the risk
   to confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of <xref target='RFC3611'/> does
   not apply.
