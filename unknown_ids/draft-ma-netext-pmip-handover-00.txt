   Network-based Inter-domain handover Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6
                  draft-ma-netext-pmip-handover-00.txt

Abstract

   [RFC5380] prompts the Inner-domain handover of the MN in Proxy Mobile
   IPv6(PMIPv6).This document describes network-based Inter-domain
   handover functionality and corresponding mobility options for
   PMIPv6.This document strictly abides by the two principle describes
   in PMIPv6:

   (a)The movement of MN is transparent to CN.

   (b)MN doesn't participate in any mobility-related signaling.LMA and
   MAG are responsible for managing IP mobility on behalf of the host.

   The points of this document are as follows:

   (1) Concepts: The MN's Home Agent(HA) ,Home Address (HoA) and Care-of
   address(CoA) is not only for user but also for the specific
   session.MN initiating a session uses the address assigned by the LMA
   which the MN is registered at the moment as the HoA for the
   session.The user initiating a session uses the address assigned by
   the LMA which the MN moves to as the CoA for the session.

   (2) Binding Cache:Every local mobility anchor must maintain two
   Binding Cache entries for each currently registered mobile node.  One
   is Inner-domain BCE,the other is Inter-domain BCE.  Inner-domain BCE
   maintains the binding between MN's Proxy-CoA and MN's HoA.  Inter-
   domain BCE maintains the bingding between CN's HoA and CN's CoA.

   (3)Communication:For the user initiating a session or accepting a
   session,no matter how it moves,the HoA for the session is
   unchanged,the source address of the data packets is the user's own
   HoA,and the destination address of the the data packets is the HoA of
   CN.All the reverse tunneled packets that the local mobility anchor
   received from the mobile access gateway, after removing the tunnel
   header MUST be routed to the destination specified in the inner
   packet header.  According to looking up the Inter-domain BCE,LMA gets
   the CoA of CN.  Then ,LMA encapsulates the packets to route to CN.On
   receiving a packet from a correspondent node with the destination

   address matching a mobile node's home network prefix(es), the local
   mobility anchor MUST first remove the outer header before forwarding
   the packet.  Then,LMA looks up the Inner-domain BCE to forward the
   packets to the right MAG.

   (4)Updates:When MN moves to visited LMA(MN-vLMA),MN-vLMA will do
   three things.

   Firstly MN-vLMA will assign a MN-CoA for MN and build up the Inner-
   domain BCE for MN.  Secondly,MN-vLMA will sends message to MN-hLMA to
   get the HoA of CN .Then,MN-vLMA builds up the binding between CN-HoA
   and CN-HoA in the Inter-domain BCE.Thirdly, MN-vLMA sends message to
   CN-LMA wiht the MN-CoA and MN-HoA included in the message to help CN-
   LMA updating the Inter-domain BCE for MN.

1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] is network based mobility
   management protocol which allows IP mobility session continuity for a
   Mobile Node (MN) without its involvement in mobility management
   signaling.  In RFC5213 the inter-domain handover is not involved.This
   document describes the network-based Inter-domain handover options,
   and the corresponding functionality for Inter-domain handover for
   PMIPv6.  The Inter-domain handover takes place during MN moves from
   home LMA(hLMA) to visited LMA(vLMA).

   The network-based Inter-domain handover functionality described in
   this specification does not depend on information provisioned to
   external entities, such as the Domain Name System (DNS) or the
   Authentication,Authorization and Accounting (AAA) infrastructure.
   The trust relationship and coordination management between LMAs
   within a PMIPv6 domain is deployment specific and will be described
   in this specification.


2.  Requirements and Terminology

2.1.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   In addition to the terminology defined in [RFC5213], the following
   terminology is also used:

   hLMA

   Home Local Mobility Anchor is the first LMA the MN registered and is
   the home agent for the mobile node in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  It
   is the topological anchor point for the mobile node's home network
   prefix(es) and is the entity that manages the mobile node's binding
   state.  The local mobility anchor has the functional capabilities of
   a home agent as defined in Mobile IPv6 base specification [RFC3775]
   with the additional capabilities required for supporting Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 protocol as defined in this specification.

   vLMA

   The vLMA is the LMA the MN visited.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title               October 2011


   rPBU

   A request message sent by a mobile access gateway to a mobile node's
   local mobility anchor for establishing a binding between the mobile
   node's home network prefix(es) assigned to a given interface of a
   mobile node and its current care-of address (Proxy-CoA).

   rPBA

   A reply message sent by a local mobility anchor in response to a
   Proxy Binding Update message that it received from a mobile access
   gateway.

   pPBU

   A request message sent from a LMA to another LMA.  There are two
   kinds of message formats:a message sent from vLMA to hLMA and a
   message sent from vLMA to CN's LMA.

   pPBA

   A reply message sent from a LMA to another LMA.  There are two kinds
   of message formats:a message sent from hLMA to vLMA and a message
   sent from CN's LMA to vLMA.

   Home AAA (hAAA):

   An Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server located
   in MN's home network.  In scope of this document the hAAA corresponds
   to a RADIUS server that includes the role of the PMIPv6 Policy Store.

   Visited AAA (vAAA):

   An Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server located
   in MN's visited network.  In this document the vAAA is the AAA server
   that acts as a RADIUS Proxy when the MN moves or attaches through the
   Visited network.  The VAAA receives an authentication (or accounting)
   request from an AAA client such as a NAS, forwards the request to the
   hAAA server, receives the reply from the hAAA, and sends that reply
   back to the AAA client potentially adding changes to reflect local
   administrative policy.


3.  The assumptions on the PMIPv6 domain

   They are discussed here as they have an impact on PMIPv6 deployment.

   Home AAA server records the user's static and dynamic information,and

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title               October 2011


   the dynamic information includes the information of LMA which the MN
   is registered right now.

   The MN's Home Address (HoA) and Care-of address(CoA) is not only for
   user but also for the specific session.

   MN initiating a session uses the address assigned by the LMA which
   the MN is registered as the HoA for the session.The user initiating a
   session uses the address assigned by the LMA which the MN moves to as
   the CoA for the session.

   CN accepting a session uses the address assigned by the LMA which the
   CN is registered as the HoA for the session.CN accepting a session
   uses the address assigned by the LMA which the CN moves to as the CoA
   for the session.

   For the user initiating a session or accepting a session,no matter
   how it moves,the HoA for the session is unchanged,while the CoA for
   the session is changing.Then, the source address of the data packets
   sent by a user initiating a session or accepting a session is the
   user's own HoA,and the destination address of the the data packets is
   the HoA of the other end of the session.

   The network-based Inter-domain handover Management not only ensures
   the continuity in the session but also ensures that the MN will not
   detect any change with respect to CN.

   This specification diverses the PBU/PBA message into two kinds of
   message formate: pPBU/pPBA message between LMAs ,rPBU/rPBA message
   between LMA and MAG.


4.  Local Mobility Anchor Operation

   The local mobility anchor MUST support the home agent function as
   defined in [RFC3775] and the extensions defined in this
   specification.  A home agent with these modifications and enhanced
   capabilities for supporting the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol is
   referred to as a local mobility anchor.This section describes the
   operational details of the local mobility anchor.

4.1.  Home address configuration

   LMA not only assignes the network prefix of the home address for the
   new users , but also configures the home address for the new users.So
   that LMA can performs mobility management on behalf of a mobile node.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title               October 2011


4.2.  Binding Cache Entry Data in LMA

   Every local mobility anchor MUST maintain two Binding Cache entries
   for each currently registered mobile node.  One is Inner-domain
   BCE,the other is Inter-domain BCE.  Inner-domain BCE maintains the
   binding between MN's Proxy-CoA and MN's HoA.  Inter-domain BCE
   maintains the bingding between CN's HoA and CN's CoA.

4.3.   Forwarding Considerations

   LMA should intercepts the packets sent to the Mobile Node's Home
   Network:When the local mobility anchor is serving a mobile node, it
   MUST be able to receive packets that are sent to the mobile node's
   home network.  In order for it to receive those packets, it MUST
   advertise a connected route in to the Routing Infrastructure for the
   mobile node's home network prefix(es) or for an aggregated prefix
   with a larger scope.  This essentially enables IPv6 routers in that
   network to detect the local mobility anchor as the last-hop router
   for the mobile node's home network prefix(es).

4.3.1.   Forwarding Packets Sent by the Mobile Node

   All the reverse tunneled packets that the local mobility anchor
   received from the mobile access gateway, after removing the tunnel
   header MUST be routed to the destination specified in the inner
   packet header.  According to looking up the Inter-domain BCE,LMA gets
   the CoA of CN.  Then ,LMA encapsulates the packets to route to CN.
   The format of the tunneled packet is shown below:

   IPv6 header (src= LMAA, dst= CN's CoA) /* Tunnel Header */

   IPv6 header (src= MN's HoA, dst= CN's HoA ) /* Packet Header */

   Upper layer protocols /* Packet Content*/

4.3.2.   Forwarding Packets to the Mobile Node:

   On receiving a packet from a correspondent node with the destination
   address matching a mobile node's home network prefix(es), the local
   mobility anchor MUST first remove the outer header before forwarding
   the packet.  Then,LMA looks up the Inner-domain BCE to forward the
   packets to the right MAG.The format of the tunneled packet is shown
   below:

   IPv6 header (src= LMAA, dst= MN's Proxy CoA) /* Tunnel Header */

   IPv6 header (src= CN's HoA, dst= MN's HoA ) /* Packet Header */

5.   Mobile Access Gateway Operation

   RFC5213 introduces a new functional entity, the mobile access gateway
   (MAG).The mobile access gateway is the entity that is responsible for
   detecting the mobile node's movements to and from the access link and
   sending the Proxy Binding Update messages to the local mobility
   anchor.  In essence, the mobile access gateway performs mobility
   management on behalf of a mobile node.

   Every mobile access gateway MUST maintain a Binding Update List.Each
   entry in the Binding Update List represents a mobile node's mobility
   binding with its local mobility anchor.  The Binding Update List is a
   conceptual data structure.

   For supporting this specification, the conceptual Binding Update List
   entry data structure needs be extended as follows:

   (a)After detecting a new mobile node on its access link, the mobile
   access gateway MUST identify the mobile node and acquire its MN-
   Identifier.  If it determines that the network-based mobility
   management service needs to be offered to the mobile node, it MUST
   send a Proxy Binding Update message to the local mobility anchor.

   (b)If the MAG detectes the MN's registration is initial binding
   registration , the MAG will maintain a binding between MN's HoA and
   hLMA when it recieves the rPBA message.

   (c)If the MAG detectes the MN is performing a inter-domain handover ,
   the MAG will maintain a binding between MN's HoA ,vLMA and CoA when
   it recieves the rPBA message from vLMA.  The CoA which is included in
   rPBA message is the address vLMA assigns for MN.


6.   Protocol Operation

   In order to improve the performance during inter-handover (when
   operations such as attachment to a new LMA and signaling between LMAs
   are involved), the PFMIPv6 protocol in this document specifies new
   message forms between the MN's hLMA and MN's vLMA and new message
   forms between the MN's vLMA and CN's LMA.  In this specification take
   the communication between MN and CN as a example.  Both MN and CN are
   in PMIPv6 domain.

6.1.   Initial Binding Registration and Forwarding Considerations

   Both MN and CN are in PMIPv6 domain.The related signaling of Initial
   Binding Registration is described in RFC5213.  Both MN and CN has
   registered in its hLMA ,and both gets its home address (MN-HoA and
   CN-HoA).The reference network is illustrated in Figure 1.

                         Forwarding Considerations

   Forwarding Considerations:

   (a) Packets from MN to CN:

   (1).The source address is MN-HoA, and the destination address is CN-
   HoA.

   (2).The packets are forwarded from MN to MN-MAG through Link-layer.

   (3).The packets are forwarded form MN-MAG to MN-hLMA through tunnel,
   the source address of the tunnel is MN-MAG's IP address (MN-Proxy-
   CoA), and the destination address of the tunnel is MN-hLMA's address
   (MN-hLMAA).

   (4).MN-hLMA encapsulates the packets to route to CN.  The format of
   the tunneled packet is shown below:

   IPv6 header (src= MN-hLMAA, dst= CN's HoA) /* Tunnel Header */

   IPv6 header (src= MN's HoA, dst= CN's HoA ) /* Packet Header */

   (5)The packets are intercepted by CN-hLMA.CN-hLMA encapsulates the
   packets and forwards them to CN-MAG through tunnel, the source
   address of the tunnel is CN-hLMA's address (CN-hLMAA), and the
   destination address of the tunnel is CN-MAG's address (CN-Proxy-CoA).

   (6)CN-MAG encapsulates the packets and forwards them to CN through
   Link-layer.

   (b) Packets from CN to MN:

   (1).The source address is CN-HoA , and the destination address is MN-
   HoA .

   (2).The packets are forwarded from CN to CN-MAG through Link-layer.

   (3).The packets are forwarded form CN-MAG to CN-hLMA through tunnel,
   the source address of the tunnel is CN-Proxy-CoA and the destination
   address of the tunnel is CN-hLMAA.

   (4).CN-hLMA encapsulates the packets to route to MN.  The format of
   the tunneled packet is shown below:

   IPv6 header (src= CN-hLMAA, dst= MN's HoA) /* Tunnel Header */

   IPv6 header (src= CN's HoA, dst= MN's HoA ) /* Packet Header */

   Upper layer protocols /* Packet Content*/

   (5).  The packets are intercepted by MN-hLMA.MN-hLMA encapsulates the
   packets and forwards them to MN-MAG through tunnel, the source
   address of the tunnel is MN-hLMAA, and the destination address of the
   tunnel is MN-Proxy-CoA.

   (6).MN-MAG encapsulates the packets and forwards them to MN through
   Link-layer.

6.2.   MN Performs Inter-domain handover

   On the basis of situation described in 6.1,MN roams to MN-vLMA domain
   and CN is still in its home domain.The reference network is
   illustrated in Figure 2.

6.2.1.   Inter-domain handover operation

   In RFC5213 the inter-domain handover is not involved.This document
   describes the network-based Inter-domain handover options, and the
   corresponding functionality for Inter-domain handover for
   PMIPv6.Since the MN is not involved in IP mobility signaling in
   PMIPv6, the sequence of events illustrating the MN inter-domain
   handover are shown in Figure 3.

                  Figure 3:signaling of MN inter-handover

   (a)MN-MAG detects that a handover is imminent and sends the DeReg PBU
   message to the MN-hLMA asking MN-hLMA to remove the binding between
   MN-MAG and MN.

   (b)The MN-hLMA sends back the rPBA message to MN-MAG.

   (c) MN roams to MN-vLMA, and sends Router Solicit(RS) message to MN-
   MAG2.  The MN-HoA and CN-HoA are included in RS message.

   (d) Upon receiving RS message ,MN-MAG2 sends request to download the
   per MN Policy Profile from the MN-vAAA.

   (e)MN-vAAA assigns a MN-vLMA to MN -MAG2 ,and sends request to MN-
   hAAA to download the per MN Policy Profile .  MN-vLMA's address is
   included in the request message.

   (f)MN-hAAA receives the request message and sends the MN Policy
   Profile to MN-vAAA ,then MN-hAAA uses MN-vLMAA to take place of MN-
   hLMAA.

   (g)MN-vAAA sends the Accept Message which includes both MN-hLMAA and
   MN-vLMAA to MN-MAG2.

   (h) MN-MAG2 sends the rPBU message to MN-vLMA.  MN-HoA,CN-HoA and MN-
   hLMAA are included in rPBU message .

   (i) Upon receiving rPBU message, MN-vLMA firstly assigns a MN-CoA for
   MN ,builds up the inner-domain BCE for MN and sends rPBA message back
   to MN-MAG2 .The MN-CoA is included in rPBA message.In the Inner-
   domain BCE there is a binding between MN's Proxy-CoA2 and MN's CoA.

   Secondly,MN-vLMA sends pPBU message to MN-hLMA,the source address of
   the pPBU message is MN-vLMAA and the destination address of the pPBU
   message is MN-hLMAA.  CN-HoA is included in pPBU message.  Upon
   receiving the pPBU message,MN-hLMA sends back pPBA message to MN-
   vLMA with CN-HoA included .MN-vLMA builds up the binding between CN-
   HoA and CN-HoA in the Inter-domain BCE.

   Thirdly,MN-vLMA sends pPBU message to CN-hLMA, the source address of
   the pPBU message is MN-CoA and the destination address of the pPBU
   message is CN-HoA.The pPBU message includes the MN-CoA and MN-HoA.
   This pPBU message is packaged in UDP format,and by judging the format
   of the message CN-hLMA intercepts the pPBU message ,encapsulates the
   message and updates the Inter-domain BCE for MN.  That means in the
   Inter-domain BCE there is a binding between MN-CoA and MN-HoA.

   (j) After receiving rPBA message from MN-vLMA, MN-MAG2 builds up the
   binding among MN-HoA ,MN-CoA and MN-vLMA.  Then MN-MAG2 sends Router
   Advertise (RA) message to MN.  The inter-domain handover operation is
   over.

6.2.2.   Forwarding Consideratons

   Forwarding Considerations:

   (a) Packets from MN to CN:

   (1).The source address is MN-HoA, and the destination address is CN-
   HoA.

   (2).The packets are forwarded from MN to MN-MAG2 through Link-layer.

   (3).The packets are forwarded form MN-MAG2 to MN-hLMA through tunnel,
   the source address of the tunnel is MN-MAG2's IP address, and the
   destination address of the tunnel is MN-vLMAA.

   (4).MN-vLMA encapsulates the packets to route to CN.  The format of
   the tunneled packet is shown below:

   IPv6 header (src= MN-vLMAA, dst= CN's HoA) /* Tunnel Header */

   IPv6 header (src= MN's HoA, dst= CN's HoA ) /* Packet Header */

   Upper layer protocols /* Packet Content*/

   (5).The packets are intercepted by CN-hLMA.CN-hLMA encapsulates the
   packets and forwards them to CN-MAG through tunnel, the source
   address of the tunnel is CN-hLMAA, and the destination address of the
   tunnel is CN-Proxy-CoA .

   (6).CN-MAG encapsulates the packets and forwards them to CN through
   Link-layer.

   (b) Packets from CN to MN:

   (1).The source address is CN-HoA , and the destination address is MN-
   HoA .

   (2).The packets are forwarded from CN to CN-MAG through Link-layer.

   (3).The packets are forwarded form CN-MAG to CN-hLMA through tunnel,
   the source address of the tunnel is CN-Proxy-CoA and the destination
   address of the tunnel is CN-hLMAA.

   (4).CN-hLMA encapsulates the packets to route to MN.  The format of
   the tunneled packet is shown below:

   Upper layer protocols /* Packet Content*/

   (5).  The packets are intercepted by MN-vLMA.MN-vLMA encapsulates the
   packets and forwards them to MN-MAG2 through tunnel, the source
   address of the tunnel is MN-vLMAA, and the destination address of the
   tunnel is MN-Proxy-CoA2.

8.  Security Considerations

   The potential security threats against any network-based mobility
   management protocol are described in [RFC4832].  This section
   explains how Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol defends itself against those
   threats.

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol recommends the signaling messages, Proxy
   Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement, exchanged between
   the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor or between a
   local mobility anchor and a local mobility anchorto be protected
   using IPsec using the established security associationbetween them.
   This essentially eliminates the threats related to the impersonation
   of the mobile access gateway or the local mobility anchor.

   This specification allows a mobile access gateway to send binding
   registration messages on behalf of a mobile node.  If proper
   authorization checks are not in place, a malicious node may be able
   to hijack a mobile node's mobility session or may carry out a denial-
   of-service attack.  To prevent this attack, this specification
   requires the local mobility anchor to allow only authorized mobile
   access gateways that are part of that Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to
   send Proxy Binding Update messages on behalf of a mobile node.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title               October 2011


   To eliminate the threats on the interface between the mobile access
   gateway and the mobile node, this specification requires an
   established trust between the mobile access gateway and the mobile
   node and to authenticate and authorize the mobile node before it is
   allowed to access the network.  Further, the established
   authentication mechanisms enabled on that access link will ensure
   that there is a secure binding between the mobile node's identity and
   its link-layer address.  The mobile access gateway will definitively
   identify the mobile node from the packets that it receives on that
   access link.

   To address the threat related to a compromised mobile access gateway,
   the local mobility anchor, before accepting a Proxy Binding Update
   message for a given mobile node, may ensure that the mobile node is
   attached to the mobile access gateway that sent the Proxy Binding
   Update message.  This may be accomplished by contacting a trusted
   entity, which is able to track the mobile node!_s current point of
   attachment.  However, the specific details of the actual mechanisms
   for achieving this is outside the scope of this document.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines six new Mobility Header options, the
   HomeNetwork Prefix Option, Handoff Indicator Option, Access
   Technology Type Option, Mobile Node Link-layer Identifier Option,
   Link-local Address Option, and Timestamp Option.  The Type value for
   these options has been assigned from the same numbering space as
   allocated for the other mobility options,as defined in [RFC3775].

   The Handoff Indicator Option introduces a new Handoff Indicator (HI)
   numbering space, where the values from 0 to 5 have been reserved by
   this document.  Approval of new Handoff Indicator type values are to
   be made through IANA Expert Review.

   The Access Technology Type Option introduces a new Access Technology
   type (ATT) numbering space, where the values from 0 to 5 have been
   reserved by this document.  Approval of new Access Technology type
   values are to be made through IANA Expert Review.

   This document also defines new Binding Acknowledgement status values.
   The status values MUST be assigned from the same number space used
   for Binding Acknowledgement status values,as defined in [RFC3775].
   The allocated values for each of thesestatus values must be greater
   than 128.

   The rest of the values in the 16-bit field are reserved.  New values
   can be assigned by Standards Action or IESG approval.

   This document also creates a new registry for the flags in the
   Binding Acknowledgment message called the "Distinguish Flag".  The
   following values are reserved.
