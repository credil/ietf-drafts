Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base for use with network management protocols in the
   Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for
   modeling of the Path Computation Element communication Protocol
   (PCEP)for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC)and a
   Path Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs when path-key-
   based inter-domain path computation is requested.

Internet-Draft         PCE-PCEP-PATHKEY-DRAFT-MIB           October 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph, and applying computational constraints.  A Path
   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
   computed.

   The PCE communication protocol (PCEP) is designed as a communication
   protocol between PCCs and PCEs for point-to-point (P2P) path
   computations and is defined in [RFC5440].

   If confidentiality is required between domains, Path-Key-Based
   mechanism is described in [RFC 5520].  For preserving the
   confidentiality of the "Confidential Path Segment (CPS)";the PCE
   returns a path containing a loose hop in place of the segment that
   must be kept confidential.

   [PCE-PCEP-DRAFT-MIB] defines a portion of the Management Information
   Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community for P2P path computations.

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base for use with network management protocols in the
   Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for
   modeling of Path Computation Element communication Protocol
   (PCEP)[RFC5440] for communications between a Path Computation Client
   (PCC)and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs in
   path-key-based inter-domain path computations.

   Some objects maybe moved to [PCE-PCEP-DRAFT-MIB] after consensus with
   the authors and working group, these are defined in section 6.2.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   CPS:  Confidential Path Segment.  A segment of a path that contains
      nodes and links that the AS policy requires to not be disclosed
      outside the AS.

   Domain:  Any collection of network elements within a common sphere of
      address management or path computational responsibility.  Examples
      of domains include Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas and
      Autonomous Systems (ASs).

Internet-Draft         PCE-PCEP-PATHKEY-DRAFT-MIB           October 2010


   IGP:  Interior Gateway Protocol.  Either of the two routing
      protocols, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Intermediate System
      to Intermediate System (IS-IS).

   PCC:  Path Computation Client: any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   P2P:  Point-to-Point

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD
   58,RFC 2578 [RFC2578] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

4.  PCEP Pathkey MIB Module Architecture

   The PCEP Pathkey MIB will contain the following information:

   o  PCEP Pathkey counters, timers and configurations

   o  PCEP Pathkey table of CPS related information.

5.  Example of the PCEP PathKey MIB module usage

   In this section we provide an example (pcePcepPathKeyTable 1) of
   using the MIB objects described in Section 6 (Object definitions) to
   monitor.  While this example is not meant to illustrate every
   permutation of the MIB, it is intended as an aid to understanding
   some of the key concepts.  It is meant to be read after going through
   the MIB itself.

7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module can be used for configuration of certain objects, and
   anything that can be configured can be incorrectly configured, with
   potentially disastrous results.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negatie effect on network operations.  These
   are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  pcePcepPathKeyDiscardTimer: Setting this value incorrectly may
      cause the expiration of Pathkey before attempt to retrieve the
      CPS.

   o  pcePcepPathKeyReUseTimer: Setting this value incorrectly may cause
      the re-use of pathkey which may not guarantee the uniqueness of
      path-key values.

   The user of the PCE-PCEP-PATHKEY-DRAFT-MIB module must therefore be
   aware that support for SET operations in a non-secure environment
   without proper protection can have a negative effect on network

   operations.

   The readable objects in the PCE-PCEP-PATHKEY-DRAFT-MIB module (i.e.,
   those with MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
   sensitive in some environments since, collectively, they provide
   information about the amount and frequency of path computation
   requests and responses within the network and can reveal some aspects
   of their configuration.

   In such environments it is important to control also GET and NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
