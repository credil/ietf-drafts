Internet-Draft                RTP keepalive                    June 2007


1.  Introduction

   Documents [2] and [3] describe NAT behaviors and point out that two
   key aspects of NAT are mappings (a.k.a. bindings) and their
   refreshment.  This introduces a derived requirement for applications
   engaged in a multimedia session involving NAT traversal: they need to
   generate a minimum of flow activity in order to create NAT mappings
   and maintain them alive.

   When applied to applications using RTP [4], the RTP media stream
   packets themselves normally fulfill this requirement.  However there
   exist some cases where RTP do not generate a minimum flow activity.

   The examples are:
   o  In some RTP usages, such as SIP, agents can negotiate a
      unidirectional media stream by using the SDP "recvonly" attribute
      on one agent and "sendonly" on the peer, as defined in RFC 3264
      [6].  RFC 3264 directs implementations not to transmit media on
      the receiving agent.  In case the agent receiving the media is
      located in the private side of a NAT, it will never receive RTP
      packets from the public peer if the NAT mapping has not been
      created.
   o  Similarly, a bidirectional media stream can be "put on hold".
      This is accomplished by using the SDP "sendonly" or "inactive"
      attributes.  Again RFC 3264 directs implementations to cease
      transmission of media in these cases.  However, doing so may cause
      NAT bindings to timeout, and media won't be able to come off hold.
   o  In case of audio media, if silence suppression is in use, long
      periods of silence may cause media transmission to cease
      sufficiently long for NAT bindings to time out.
   o  Some RTP payload formats, such as the payload format for text
      conversation [12], may send packets so infrequently that the
      interval exceeds the NAT binding timeouts.

   To solve these problems, an agent therefore needs to periodically
   send keepalive data within the outgoing RTP session of an RTP media
   stream regardless of whether the media stream is currently inactive,
   sendonly, recvonly or sendrecv, and regardless of the presence or
   value of the bandwidth attribute.

   It is also important to note that the above examples also require the
   agents to use symmetric RTP [13] in addition to RTP keepalive.

   This document first states the requirements that must be supported to
   perform RTP keepalives (Section 3).  In a second step, several
   mechanisms are laid-out to overcome this problem (Section 4).

   The scope of the draft is limited to RTP flows.  In particular, this

Internet-Draft                RTP keepalive                    June 2007


   document does not address keepalive activity related to:
   o  Session signaling flows, such as the Session Initiation Protocol
      (SIP).
   o  RTCP flows.
      *  Recall that [4] recommends a minimum interval of 5 seconds and
         that "on hold" procedures of [6] do not impact RTCP
         transmissions.  Therefore, when in use, there is always some
         RTCP flow activity.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


3.  Requirements

   This section outlines the key requirements that need to be satisfied
   in order to provide RTP media keepalive.

   REQ-1  Some data is sent periodically within the outgoing RTP session
          for the whole duration of the RTP media stream.

   REQ-2  Any type of transport (e.g.  UDP, TCP) MUST be supported.

   REQ-3  Any media type (e.g. audio, video, text) MUST be supported.

   REQ-4  Any media format (e.g.  G.711, H.263) MUST be supported.

   REQ-5  Session signaling protocols SHOULD not be impacted.

   REQ-6  Session description protocols SHOULD not be impacted.

   REQ-7  Impacts on existing software SHOULD be minimized.

   REQ-8  Remote peer SHOULD not be impacted.

   REQ-9  More than one mechanism MAY exist.


4.  List of Alternatives for Performing RTP Keepalive

   This section lists some alternatives that can be used in order to
   perform a keepalive message within RTP media streams.

Internet-Draft                RTP keepalive                    June 2007


4.1.  UDP Packet of 0-byte

   The application sends an empty UDP packet.

   Cons:
   o  This alternative is specific to UDP.

4.2.  RTCP Packets Multiplexed with RTP Packets

   The application sends RTCP packets in the RTP media stream itself
   (i.e. same tuples for both RTP and RTCP packets) [7].  RTCP packets
   therefore maintain the NAT mappings open.

   Cons:
   o  Multiplexing RTP and RTCP must be supported by the remote peer.
   o  Multiplexing RTP and RTCP must be signalled in SDP offer/answer.
   o  Some RTCP monitoring tools expect that RTCP are not multiplexed.
      [[OPEN-POINT: is this argument strong enough to keep it?]]

4.3.  STUN Indication Packet

   The application sends a STUN [8] Binding Indication packet as
   specified in ICE [5].

   Thanks to the RTP validy check, STUN packets will be ignored by the
   RTP stack.

   Cons:
   o  The agent needs to support STUN.

4.4.  RTP Packet with Incorrect Version Number

   The application sends an RTP packet with an incorrect version number,
   which value is zero.

   Based on RTP specification [4], the peer should perform a header
   validity check, and therefore ignore these types of packet.

   Cons:
   o  Only four version numbers are possible.  Using one of them for RTP
      keepalive would be wasteful.
   o  RFC4566 [9] and RFC3264 [6] mandate not to send media with
      inactive and recvonly attributes.

4.5.  RTP Packet with Comfort Noise Payload

   The application sends an RTP packet with a comfort-noise payload
   [10].

Internet-Draft                RTP keepalive                    June 2007


   Cons:
   o  This alternative is limited to audio formats only.
   o  Comfort Noise needs to be supported by the remote peer.
   o  Comfort Noise needs to be signalled in SDP offer/answer.
   o  The peer is likely to render comfort noise at the other side, so
      the content of the payload (the noise level) needs to be carefully
      chosen.

4.6.  RTP Packet with No-Op Payload

   The application sends an RTP No-OP payload [11] .

   Cons:
   o  This payload type needs to be supported by the remote peer.
   o  This payload type needs to be signalled in the SDP offer/answer.
   o  RFC4566 [9] and RFC3264 [6] mandate not to send media with
      inactive and recvonly attributes.

4.7.  RTP Packet with Unknown Payload Type

   The application sends an RTP packet with a dynamic payload type that
   has not been negotiated by the peers (e.g. not negotiated within the
   SDP offer/answer, and thus not mapped to any media format).

   Normally the peer will ignore it, as RTP [4] states that "a receiver
   MUST ignore packets with payload types that it does not understand".

   Cons:
   o  RFC4566 [9] and RFC3264 [6] mandate not to send media with
      inactive and recvonly attributes.
   o  [[OPEN-POINT: should we say something about the content of the
      payload?]]


5.  Additional considerations

   An application supporting this specification must transmit keepalive
   packets during the whole duration of the media session.

   The application can send keepalive packets under the form of any of
   the above mechanisms.

   Keepalives packets within a particular RTP session MUST use the tuple
   (source IP address, source TCP/UDP ports, target IP address, target
   TCP/UDP Port) of the regular RTP packets.

   Keepalive packets MUST be sent every Tr seconds.  Tr SHOULD be
   configurable, and otherwise MUST default to 15 seconds.  [Note: same

   value as in [5].]

   The agent SHOULD only send RTP keepalive when it does not send
   regular RTP paquets.
