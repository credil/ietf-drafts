INTERNET DRAFT             RDP Ports Registry          December 31, 2010


1.  Introduction

   Reliable Data Protocol (RDP) was firstly defined in RFC 908 [RFC908],
   that defined the usage of RDP ports and set the RDP port range as 0
   to 255. RFC 1151 [RFC1151], that defined version 2 of RDP, increased
   the number of RDP ports to 65535. In spite of this, no appropriate
   IANA registry has been created so far. This document establishes such
   registry.

2.  Registry Description 

2.1. The Name of the Registry

   The name of created registry is 'RDP Port Numbers'.

2.2. The Format of the Registry

   The 'RDP Port Numbers' registry consists of 3 values: Port Number,
   Description and Reference. They are described below:

     Port Number - an integer; refers to the value used in RDP header.
     Values form 0 to 65535 are assigned. Ports from 0 to 1023 are well-
     known. Ports from 1024 to 65535 are user-registered.

     Description - a brief decryption of port usage, up to 20
     characters.

     Reference or Registrant Information - the reference document, that
     defines the port usage or information about the registrant of the
     port number.

2.3. Registration Procedures

   New assignments to 'RDP Port Numbers' registry for well-known ports
   are to be made following the 'IESG Approval' policies; for user-
   registered ones - via Expert Review. [RFC5226] The registrant must
   provide information about the service that will use the registered
   port, such as the name, short description, reference to the
   specification document (if present), etc. 

2.4. The Initial Contents of the Registry

   This section contains the initial contents of the 'RDP Port Numbers'
   registry.

3.  Security Considerations

   The creation of this registry is not believed to add any new security
   issues to that discussed in RFC 908 [RFC908] or RFC 1151 [RFC1151].


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created the 'RDP Port Numbers' registry following the
   guidelines of Section 2 of this document.
