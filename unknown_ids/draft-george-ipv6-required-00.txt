             IPv6 Support Required for all IP-capable nodes
                     draft-george-ipv6-required-00

Abstract

   Given the global lack of available IPv4 space, and limitations in
   IPv4 extension and transition technologies, this document deprecates
   the concept that an IP-capable node MAY support IPv4 _only_, and
   redefines an IP-capable node as one which supports either IPv6 _only_
   or IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack.  This document updates RFC1812 and 1122 to
   reflect the change in requirements.

Internet-Draft                IPv6-required                 January 2011


1.  Introduction

   IP version 4 (IPv4) has served to connect public and private hosts
   all over the world for over 30 years.  However, due to the success of
   the Internet in finding new and innovative uses for IP networking,
   billions of hosts are now connected via the Internet and requiring
   unique addressing.  This demand has led to the exhaustion of the IANA
   [IANA-exhaust] global pool of unique IPv4 addresses.  While
   transition technologies and other means to extend the lifespan of
   IPv4 do exist, nearly all of them come with tradeoffs that prevent
   them from being optimal long-term solutions when compared with
   deployment of IP version 6 (IPv6) as a means to allow continued
   growth on the Internet.  See I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-
   issues [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues]and I-D.donley-
   nat444-impacts [I-D.donley-nat444-impacts] for some discussion on
   this topic. [add'l informative citations needed]

   IPv6 was proposed in 1995 [RFC 1883 [RFC1883]] as, among other
   things, a solution to the limitations on globally unique addressing
   that IPv4's 32-bit addressing space represented, and has been under
   continuous refinement and deployment ever since.  [RFC 2460
   [RFC2460]].  The exhaustion of IPv4 and the continued growth of the
   internet worldwide has created the driver for widespread IPv6
   deployment.

   However, the IPv6 deployment necessary to reduce reliance on IPv4 has
   been hampered by a lack of ubiquitous hardware and software support
   throughout the industry.  Many of those who are deploying IPv6 have
   been forced to fund the initial IPv6 implementations for their
   vendors, because the vendor continued to view IPv6 support as
   optional.  This added burden on the early adopters, plus the high
   cost of replacing installed-base that does not currently support IPv6
   has been a significant barrier to wider deployment of IPv6.  Even
   today, many vendors, especially in the consumer space are still
   selling "IP capable" devices which are not IPv6-capable, and are
   choosing not to update existing software to enable IPv6 support on
   software-updatable devices.  It is not realistic to expect that the
   hardware refresh cycle will single-handedly purge IPv4-only devices
   from the active network in a reasonable amount of time, especially in
   the consumer space, where the operator often has no control over the
   hardware the consumer chooses to use.

   This lack of support is making the eventual IPv6 transition
   considerably more difficult, and drives the need for expensive and
   complicated transition technologies to extend the life of IPv4-only
   devices as well as eventually to interwork IPv4-only and IPv6-only
   hosts.  While IPv4 is expected to coexist on the Internet with IPv6
   for many years, a transition from IPv4 as the dominant Internet

   Protocol towards IPv6 as the dominant Internet Protocol will need to
   occur.  The sooner the majority of devices support IPv6, the less
   protracted this transition period will be.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Requirements and Recommendation

   This draft updates RFC 1812 [RFC1812] to note that IP nodes SHOULD no
   longer support IPv4 only.  This is to ensure that those using it as a
   guideline for IP implementations use the other informative references
   in this document as a guideline for proper IPv6 implementations.
   This draft also updates RFC 1122 [RFC1122] to redefine generic "IP"
   support to include and require IPv6 for IP-capable nodes and routers.

   From a practical perspective, the requirements proposed by this draft
   mean that:

      New IP implementations MUST support IPv6, and current IP
      implementations SHOULD support IPv6.

      Helpful informative references can be found in RFC 4294 [RFC4294],
      and I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router
      [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router]

      Current and new IP Networking implementations SHOULD support IPv4
      and IPv6 coexistence (dual-stack), but MUST NOT require IPv4 for
      proper and complete function.

      It is expected that many existing devices and implementations will
      not be able to support IPv6 for one or more valid technical
      reasons, but for maximum flexibility and compatibility, a best
      effort SHOULD be made to update existing hardware and software to
      enable IPv6 support.

   Within the IETF, further protocol development on applications
   _exclusive_ to IPv4 SHOULD cease in order to concentrate on
   additional refinements and enhancements to IP version 6, with the
   goal of bringing IPv6 to complete parity with IPv4.  This does not
   mean that further work SHOULD NOT have support for IPv4, merely that
   it MUST happen as a part of an IP version-agnostic implementation, or
   as an implementation that explicitly supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
   New features and protocols SHOULD NOT be introduced for use as IPv4-

   only unless they are specifically in support of IPv6 transition or
   IPv4-IPv6 interworking.  A comprehensive list of these parity items
   and enhancements is outside the scope of this document, but this
   document recommends that the charters and work items of currently
   active IETF Working Groups (WGs) be evaluated to ensure that they are
   supporting the goal of full parity for IPv6.
