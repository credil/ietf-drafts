                  draft-kucherawy-authres-header-b-00

Abstract

   This memo updates the registry of allowed properties in
   Authentication-Results: message header fields to allow a multiple-
   result report to distinguish among one or more cryptographic
   signatures on a message, thus associating specific results with the
   signatures they represent.

Internet-Draft     Auth-Results header.b Registration         March 2010


1.  Introduction

   [AUTHRES] defined a new header field for electronic mail messages
   that presents the results of a message authentication effort in a
   machine-readable format.  Absent from that specification was the
   means by which the results of two cryptographic signatures, such as
   those provided by [DKIM] or [DOMAINKEYS], can both have results
   reported in an unambiguous manner.

   Fortunately, [AUTHRES] created IANA registries of reporting
   properties, enabling an easy remedy for this problem.  This memo thus
   registers an additional reporting property allowing a result to be
   associated with a specific digital signature.

2.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3.  Discussion

   A message can contain multiple signatures of a common sender
   authentication mechanism, such as [DKIM] or [DOMAINKEYS].  By
   registering supported "property.ptype" combinations, a result can be
   associated with a given signature provided the signatures are unique
   within one of the registered values (e.g. all of them had unique
   "header.d" or "header.i" values).  This is not guaranteed, however; a
   single signing agent might have practical reasons for affixing
   multiple signatures with the same "d=" values while varying other
   signature parameters.  This means one could get a "dkim=pass" and
   "dkim=fail" result simultaneously on verification which is clearly
   ambiguous.

   It is thus necessary to either create or identify a signature
   attribute guaranteed to be unique such that unambiguous association
   of a result with the signature to which it refers is possible.

   It is known that SHA1 and SHA256 hash spaces are resilient to
   collisions, and further that RSA KEY signing mechanisms are similarly
   resilient to common substrings.  Thus, the actual digital signature
   for a cryptographic signing of the message is an ideal property for
   such a unique identification.  It is not however necessary to include
   the entire digital signature in an [AUTHRES] header field just to
   identify which result goes with signature; since the signatures will
   almost always be substantially different, it is anticipated that only
   the first several bytes of a signature will be needed for
   disambiguating results.

4.  Definition

   This memo adds to the "Email Authentication Method Name Registry",
   created by IANA upon publication of [AUTHRES], the "header.b"
   reporting item.  The value associated with this item in the header
   field MUST be at least the first eight characters of the digital
   signature for which a result is being relayed, and MUST be long
   enough to be unique among the results being reported.  Where the
   signature of a future method is fewer than eight characters, the
   entire signature MUST be included.  Matching of the value of this
   item against the signature itself MUST be case-sensitive.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Per [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS], the following item is added to the "Email
   Authentication Method Name Registry":

+------------+----------+--------+----------------+--------------------+
|   Method   | Defined  | ptype  | property       | value              |
+------------+----------+--------+----------------+--------------------+
| domainkeys | RFC4870  | header | b              | full or partial    |
|            |          |        |                | value of signature |
|            |          |        |                | "b" tag            |
+------------+----------+--------+----------------+--------------------+
|    dkim    | RFC4871  | header | b              | full or partial    |
|            |          |        |                | value of signature |
|            |          |        |                | "b" tag            |
+------------+----------+--------+----------------+--------------------+

6.  Security Considerations

   [AUTHRES] discussed general security considerations regarding the use
   of this header field.  The following new security considerations
   apply when adding or processing this new ptype/property combination:

6.1.  Improvement

   Rather than introducing a new security issue, this can be seen to fix
   a security weakness of the original specification in that useful
   information can now be obtained from results that could previously
   have been ambiguous and thus obscured or, worse, misinterpreted.

6.2.  Forged Header Fields

   Even considering the forgery issues discussed in the original
   document, an attempt could be made to counfound a consumer of this
   header field by indicating more than one result for the same
   signature from the same evaluating agent (i.e. bearing the same

   "authserv-id").  In this case the consumer of this header field is
   best advised to ignore the header field entirely.

   Example 6: Headers reporting results from multiple MTAs in different
   ADMDs

   In this example we see multi-tiered authentication with an extended
   trust boundary.

   The message was sent from someone at example.com's New York office
   (newyork.example.com) to a mailing list managed at an intermediary.

Internet-Draft     Auth-Results header.b Registration         March 2010


   The message was signed at the origin using [DKIM].

   The message was sent to a mailing list service provider called
   example.net, which is used by example.com.  There,
   meetings@example.net is expanded to a long list of recipients, one of
   that is at the Chicago office.  In this example, we will assume that
   the trust boundary for chicago.example.com includes the mailing list
   server at example.net.

   The mailing list server there first authenticated the message and
   affixed an Authentication-Results header field indicating such using
   its DNS domain name for the authserv-id.  It then altered the message
   by affixing some footer text to the body, including some
   administrivia such as unsubscription instructions.  Finally, the
   mailing list server affixes a second [DKIM] signature and begins
   distribution of the message.

   The border MTA for chicago.example.com explicitly trusts results from
   mail-router.example.net so that header field is not removed.  It
   performs evaluation of both signatures and determines that the first
   (most recent) is a "pass" but, because of the aforementioned
   modifications, the second is a "fail".  However, the first signature
   included the Authentication-Results header added at mail-
   router.example.net that validated the second signature.  Thus,
   indirectly, it can be determined that the authentications claimed by
   both signatures are indeed valid.

   The presence of "header.b" tags on the Authentication-Results header
   fields shown positively associate the results with the signatures
   that generated them.  Without these, such determination would not be
   possible without some out-of-band communication between the signature
   evaluating code and downstream agents.
