      <t>Current location configuration protocols are capable of provisioning an Internet host with a location URI that refers to the host's location.  However, these protocols lack a mechnism for the htarget host to inspect or set the privacy rules that are applied to the URIs they distribute.  This document extends the current location configuration protocols to provide hosts with a reference to the rules that are applied to a URI, so that the host can view or set these rules.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro-sec" title="Introduction">
      <t>A critical step in enabling Internet hosts to access location-based services is to provision those hosts with information about their own location.  This is accomplished via a Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps"></xref>, which allow a location provider (e.g., a local access network) to inform a host about its location.</t>
      <t>There are two basic patterns for location configuration, namely configuration "by value" and "by reference" <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements"></xref>.  Configuration by value provisions a host directly with its location, by providing it location information that is directly usable (e.g., coordinates or a civic address).  Configuration by reference provides a host with a URI that references the host's location, i.e., one that can be dereferenced to obtain the location (by value) of the host.</t>
      <t>In some cases, location by reference offers a few benefits over location by value.  From a privacy perspective, the required dereference transaction provides a policy enforcement point, so that the opaque URI itself can be safely conveyed over untrusted media (e.g., SIP through untrusted proxies <xref target="RFC5606"></xref>).  If the target host is mobile, an application provider can use a single reference to obtain the location of the host multiple times, saving bandwidth to the host.  For some configuration protocols, the location object referenced by a location URI provides a much more expressive syntax for location values than the configuration protocol itself (e.g., DHCP geodetic location <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-rfc3825bis"></xref> versus GML in a PIDF-LO <xref target="RFC4119"></xref>). </t>
      <t>From a privacy perspective, however, current LCPs are limited in their flexibility, in that they do not provide the Target (the client in an LCP) with a way to inform the Location Server with policy for how his location information should be handled.  This document addresses this gap by defining a simple mechanism for referring to and manipulating policy, and by extending current LCPs to carry policy references.  Using the mechanisms defined in this document, a Location Server (acting as an LCP server) can inform a client as to which policy document controls a given location resource, and the LCP client (a Target and Rule Maker) can inspect this document and modify it as necessary.</t>
      <t>The remainder of this document is structured as follows: After introducing a few relevant terms, we define policy URIs as a channel for referencing, inspecting, and updating policy documents.  We then define extensions to HELD protocol and the DHCP option for location by reference to allow these protocols to cary policy URIs.  Examples are given that demonstrate how policy URIs are carried in these protocols and how they can be used by clients.</t>

    <section anchor="policy-uri-sec" title="Policy URIs">
      <t>A policy URI is an HTTP or HTTPS URI that a Rule Holder can use to inspect and install policy documents that tell a location server how it should protect a given location resource.  A policy URI is always a reference to a common-policy document <xref target="RFC4745"></xref> (possibly including some extensions, e.g., for geolocation policy <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy"></xref>).</t>
      <t>A server that is the authority for policy URIs MUST support GET, PUT, and DELETE requests to these URIs, in order to allow clients to inspect, replace, and delete policy documents.  While the server MAY deny any particular request according to local policy, it SHOULD allow all requests (with any of the three methods) from the Target of the protected location resource.  Clients MUST likewise support the three required request types.</t>
      <t>A GET request to a policy URI is a request for the referenced policy information.  In response to a GET request, the server MUST validate that the requestor is an authorized Rule Maker or Rule Holder according to local policy.  If the request is valid, then the server MUST send an HTTP 200 response containing the full policy document referenced by the URI, in the common-policy format; these responses MUST have content-type 'application/auth-policy+xml'.</t>
      <t>A PUT request to a policy URI is a request to replace the current policy.  The entity-body of a PUT requests MUST be a common-policy document; it must have content-type 'application/auth-policy+xml'.  When a server receives a PUT request, it MUST validate the policy document included in the body of the request, and it MUST validate that the requestor is an authorized Rule Maker or Rule Holder according to local policy.  If the request is valid, then the server MUST replace the current policy document referenced by the URI with the policy document provided in the request.</t>
      <t>A DELETE request to a policy URI is a request to delete the referenced policy document and terminate access to the protected resource.  In response to a DELETE request, the server MUST validate that the requestor is an authorized Rule Maker or Rule Holder according to local policy.  If the request is valid, then the server MUST delete the policy document referenced by the URI and disallow any further access to the location resource it governs.</t>
      <t>It should be noted that this usage of HTTP is generally compatible with the use of XCAP or WebDAV to manage policy documents, but this document does not define or require the use of these protocols.</t>

    <section anchor="extn-sec" title="Location Configuration Extensions">
      <t>Location configuration protocols can provision hosts with location URIs that refer to the host's location.  If the target host is to control policy on these URIs, it needs a way to access the policy that the server will use to guide its interactions.  This section defines extensions to LCPs to carry policy URIs that the target can use to control access to location resources.</t>

      <t>There are two main classes of risks associated with access control policy management: The risk of unauthorized disclosure of the protected resource via manipulation of the policy management process, and the risk of disclosure of policy information itself.</t>
      <t>Protecting the policy management process from manipulation entails two primary requirements: First, the policy URI has to be faithfully transmitted to the client, and second, the policy document has to be faithfully transmitted to the location server.  The first requirement is met by the integrity properties of the underlying LCP.  To meet the second requirement, the LCP server SHOULD provide HTTPS policy URIs and the policy server SHOULD support cipher suites that provide integrity protection.</t>
      <t>Authorization policy at the policy server also plays a central role in the protection of both location information and user policy information.  In order to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of location information and policyinformation, the policy server MUST authenticate all requests to policy URIs and verify that the requestor is an authorized Rule Maker for the protected location resource.  In the particular case where the target itself is an authorized Rule Maker and the target is identified to the LS by its IP address, the server MAY use IP return routability as an authentication mechanism.</t>
      <t>Finally, policy information must be protected from observation by unauthorized entities en route between the client and the policy server.  This protection is provided by the use of HTTPS with appropriate cipher suites.</t>
