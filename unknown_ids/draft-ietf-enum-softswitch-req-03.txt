Abstract

   This document describes experiences of operational requirements and
   several considerations for ENUM-based softswitches concerning call
   routing between two Korean VoIP carriers, gained during the ENUM pre-
   commercial trial hosted by National Internet Development Agency of
   Korea (NIDA) in 2006.

   These experiences show that an interim solution can maintain the
   stability of on-going commercial softswitch system operations during
   the initial stage of ENUM service, where the DNS does not have
   sufficient data for the majority of calls.

Internet-Draft             Softswitch ENUM Use                 June 2008


1.  Introduction

   ENUM[RFC3761] is a mapping system based on DNS[RFC1034] [RFC1035]
   that converts from an E.164[E164] number to a domain name using the
   Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) [RFC3403] resource record type.
   ENUM is able to store different service types (such as fax, email,
   homepage, SIP, H.323 and so on), for every E.164 number.  It
   originally focused on how end-users could gain access to other end-
   user's communications contact information through the Internet.

   Recently, discussion on the need to update RFC 3761 has begun, to
   ensure that the standard also works in the "Infrastructure ENUM"
   scenario, where ENUM provides routing information between carriers.
   This has resulted in two documents, the updated ENUM specification
   [draft-rfc3761bis] and an Enumservice guide
   [draft-enumservice-guide].

   When providing VoIP service, a VoIP carrier that wants to integrate
   various protocols typically uses a softswitch.  However, such a
   system is still inefficient for interconnection, number portability,
   and sharing protocol support information among carriers, because each
   softswitch does not have complete end-to-end routing information for
   all carriers.  This information can be stored in DNS, using ENUM.
   Therefore, carriers can expect to gain many advantages if they use
   ENUM within the call routing functions of their softswitches.

   To confirm these benefits and to verify the performance of ENUM-
   enabled softswitches, NIDA cooperated with two Korean VoIP service
   providers for an Infrastructure ENUM trial in 2006.  NIDA is a non-
   profit organization with a mandate to manage 2.8.e164.arpa.
   (representing the +82 country code of Korea).  NIDA promotes and
   facilitates technical cooperation on a national scale between
   partners, and this includes ENUM.  During the trial, NIDA provided a
   centralized ENUM DNS to each VoIP service provider for call routing.
   The data used in this Infrastructure trial was also accessible to the
   public (i.e. it was an Internet-based system, rather than a closed
   scheme).

2.  Call Routing on Softswitch

   In the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), hardware-based
   switches predominate in the network.  A softswitch provides similar
   functionality, but is implemented on a computer system by software.
   It typically has to support various signalling protocols (such as
   SIP[RFC3261], H.323[H323], MGCP[RFC3435], and others), to make call
   connections for VoIP service, often on the boundary point between the
   circuit and packet network.

   To make a call, first of all a softswitch must discover routing
   information.  It has to process the E.164 number that comes from a
   caller through its own routing table.  The goal is to determine how
   the call can be routed towards the callee, so that either the call
   can be processed through the softswitch or the caller can connect to
   the callee directly.

   Today, call routing is often based on a prefix of the dialled number.
   This is used very widely not only for legacy PSTN switches, but also
   for softswitches.  So, if a softswitch exclusively uses ENUM DNS for
   call routing, then in the beginning most of the calls queried to ENUM
   DNS would fail if there are only a small group of carriers
   provisioning data into ENUM.  However a softswitch will have a higher
   success rate with ENUM DNS as the number of carriers grows, and so
   the overall percentage of numbers provisioned in ENUM increases.  In
   short, ENUM as a long term solution has obvious benefits, but the
   problem lies in migrating from today's prefix based routing towards
   that long term ENUM-based solution.

3.  Infrastructure ENUM trial in Korea

   As described in Section 1, NIDA and two VoIP Service Providers built
   ENUM-processing modules into their softswitches, interconnected these
   via the IP network, and provisioned their trial users' numbers into a
   centralized ENUM DNS system operated by NIDA.  The carriers
   provisioned their E.164 numbers using EPP [RFC4114] to a centralized
   Registration Server (also operated by NIDA).  Changes to the ENUM
   data were implemented and updated to the ENUM DNS instantly, using
   DNS Dynamic Update [RFC2136].

   In the trial, the EPP-based provisioning sub-system was developed and
   operated separately from the carriers' main customer provisioning
   systems and protocols.  It was not integrated as the carriers already
   operated their own customer provisioning systems that were totally
   different from the EPP-based model, and (as mission-critical
   components) those were not open to modification.

4.  Requirement for ENUM-based Softswitches

4.1.  Call routing cases for DNS response codes

   To use ENUM DNS, each softswitch needs to have an ENUM module that
   converts from an E.164 number to the ENUM domain name (as defined in
   RFC 3761) and processes a query to ENUM DNS.  This ENUM module uses
   the algorithm specified in RFC 3761.

   However, in the initial stage of ENUM DNS roll-out, ENUM shares call
   routing information from a limited number of carriers.  There is the
   problem that a softswitch can't find all of the call routing
   information it needs just using ENUM.  To solve this problem, ENUM-
   based softswitches have to follow a consistent set of rules.  In the
   Korean trial, the rules were:

   1.  The ENUM module of the softswitch converts an E.164 number coming
       from the VoIP subscriber to an ENUM domain name (as defined in
       RFC 3761).

   2.  The ENUM module, acting as a DNS stub resolver, sends a query to
       a recursive name server.

   3.  if the ENUM module receives a DNS answer, the call routing
       process may branch off in several ways, depending on the Rcode
       value in the DNS response message, as shown below.

       A.  Rcode=0 (No error condition)
           There is, potentially, an answer to the corresponding query.
           The normal call routing process needs to differentiate
           between the following conditions:

           +  The response includes no URI (such as SIP or H.323) that
              can be used to initiate a call -
              The call fails immediately.
              Note: In the trial, the condition in which a telephone
              number is valid, can only be reached via the Internet, but
              is not currently in service is indicated by an ENUM domain
              that DOES exist but DOES NOT include any supported
              (routable) NAPTRs.  A softswitch receiving this response
              interprets it as indicating that the call can be dropped
              immediately - it would fail if passed to the PSTN.

           +  There is at least one usable URI (such as SIP and/or H.323
              URIs) -
              The softswitch picks one based on the preference and order
              values in the NAPTR Resource Record Set, and routes the
              call using the method described in Section 4.2.

Internet-Draft             Softswitch ENUM Use                 June 2008


       B.  Rcode=3 (Name error), 1 (Format Error), 2 (Server Failure), 4
           (Not Implemented) or 5 (Refused)
           There is no valid answer for the query.
           The softswitch has no choice but to route the call using the
           E.164 number with its vendor-specific method (such as a
           prefix-based method).  In this case, it means that the call
           has to be delivered through the PSTN for onward call routing.

           It is also important to stress that the ENUM DNS servers MUST
           respond to all queries they receive from the softswitches.
           If the ENUM module in a softswitch does not receive a
           response, it will eventually time out, and the ENUM module
           will treat this as a DNS error.  However, the delay involved
           is long in terms of the normal call setup time, and should be
           avoided.

4.2.  Call routing cases for domainparts

   If the DNS response has a valid URI such as SIP or H.323, the
   softswitch can resolve the domain name part of that URI to route a
   call by searching two different sources.  One is a recursive
   nameserver, and the other is a fixed routing table held in the
   softswitch, mapping from the domain name to the corresponding
   gateway's host name and IP address.

   If there are many points of interconnection, using a recursive
   nameserver is useful for resolving a domain name, but if there are
   just a few known carriers and they do not change this interconnection
   information frequently, a fixed (internal) routing table mapping from
   domain name to the corresponding gateway hostname and IP address is
   more efficient (rather than querying the recursive nameserver every
   time).  In addition, carriers would like to charge an interconnection
   fee for all received calls, so they tend to make interconnection only
   with trusted carriers based on some sort of bilateral agreement
   between these carriers.  They may agree on a specific gateway for
   this purpose, so the interconnection information is often private to
   the parties of this particular agreement.

   These two types of domain routing are also affected by the Rcode=0
   case described in Section 4.1.

   There are two choices for routing.  These are described and compared
   here:

   1.  Case when using a fixed routing table:

       A.  If the domain name part of the URI is found in the internal
           fixed routing table, the softswitch can use it.

Internet-Draft             Softswitch ENUM Use                 June 2008


       B.  If the domain name part of URI does not exist in the fixed
           routing table, the call is forwarded to the PSTN.

   2.  Case when using a recursive nameserver:

       A.  If the domain name part of the URI can be resolved via the
           recursive nameserver, the softswitch can use it.

       B.  If the domain name part of the URI cannot be resolved on the
           recursive nameserver for any reason (such as a response with
           no usable resource records according to [RFC3263] and
           [RFC3261], or with Rcode=1, 2, 3, 4, or 5), the call must be
           forwarded to the PSTN.

   Case (1) seems inefficient because the administrator maintains two
   management points for numbers; the ENUM DNS and the softswitch
   itself.  However this configuration can minimize the call routing
   failure ratio during the transition period of ENUM (when there are
   relatively few provisioned ENUM entries and so few IP-based Points Of
   Interconnection).  Thus case (1) could reasonably be implemented on
   the softswitches during the trial phase, and hereafter as ENUM
   entries are populated, case (2) would be a reasonable choice.

   With these choices, the two carriers could use ENUM DNS for call
   routing without any impact on their on-going commercial VoIP service.

5.  Trial Results

   To provide a stable commercial service, an ENUM-based softswitch must
   have a defined performance, in the same way as must any non-ENUM-
   based softswitch.  The only difference between these two types of
   softswitch is the searching mechanism for call routing information,
   which can be stored in the softswitch itself or in the DNS.
   Therefore a similar delay time for call routing is important to
   guarantee quality of service.  During the trial, each carrier
   measured this delay time when using the SIP protocol.  This was based
   on the "Answer Delay time", defined as the elapsed time between
   requesting a call ('INVITE' message) and receiving a response ('200
   OK' message) [RFC3261].

               +------------------------+------+----------+
               |        Call Type       | ENUM | Non-ENUM |
               +------------------------+------+----------+
               |      Carrier A->A      | 2.33 |   2.28   |
               |                        |      |          |
               |      Carrier A->B      | 2.23 |   2.25   |
               |                        |      |          |
               | Carrier A->other(PSTN) | 4.11 |   3.79   |
               |                        |      |          |
               |      Carrier B->B      | 2.18 |   2.05   |
               |                        |      |          |
               |      Carrier B->A      | 2.19 |   2.19   |
               |                        |      |          |
               | Carrier B->other(PSTN) | 3.95 |   3.41   |
               +------------------------+------+----------+

                 Table 1: Average Answer Delay time (sec)

   As shown in Table 1, there is little difference in time (under a
   second) between the ENUM and non-ENUM cases.  Therefore it is
   difficult for a caller with either carrier to detect the choice (ENUM
   or non-ENUM) as an aspect of quality when a call initiates.  This
   means that ENUM definitely works well with softswitches on a
   commercial basis.

   To make the trial more realistic, the resolver that was used by these
   ENUM-based softswitches was a recursive nameserver that could be
   accessed publicly.  This was done as it was felt that a tough
   condition would be better to verify the fact that an ENUM-based

6.  'e164.arpa' considerations

   During the trial, the Infrastructure ENUM deployed in the
   2.8.e164.arpa zone could be accessed via the (public) Internet.  In
   this situation, each carrier questioned whether the centralized
   number management under the ENUM DNS was realistic or not.

   Another issue concerned responsibility for routing errors.  All
   carriers can use the shared ENUM data to route their calls.  However,
   if there are routing errors (due to the data being provisioned
   incorrectly), it is not always clear who has responsibility for these
   errors and who can correct the data.  The errors occur in the
   networks of the carriers placing the calls.  Unless the identity of
   the carrier responsible for delivering service to this telephone
   number is known, it is not obvious (to the carrier handling the
   error) who should be informed of these problems.  This is a
   particular issue when number portability is introduced.

   In addition, the carriers also question whether or not Infrastructure
   ENUM needs to be accessible publicly.  To prevent disclosure of
   telephone numbers, they would prefer to access the ENUM DNS
   privately.  Therefore any ENUM module embedded in a softswitch needs
   to be flexible, to adopt these considerations during the interim
   period of ENUM, before common policies and agreements have been
   forged.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document inherits the security considerations described in RFC
   3761 and 'draft-ietf-enum-infrastructure-05.txt'
   [draft-enum-infrastructure], as the ENUM DNS used with softswitches
   in this trial could be accessed publicly.

   In addition, if the recursive resolvers handling ENUM queries coming
   from a softswitch were to be compromised by an attacker, that
   attacker would be able to force calls to fail or cause delay to
   calls.  Therefore, the DNS resolvers used should allow access from
   the local network to which the softswitch is connected, whilst
   restricting access from outside, using a proper access-list policy.
