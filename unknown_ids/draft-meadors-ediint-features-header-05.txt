Draft                  EDI-INT Features Header            October 2008 
 
 
   With the maturity of the EDI-INT standard of AS1, AS2 and AS3, 
   applications and additional features are being built upon the basic 
   secure transport functionality. These features are not necessarily 
   supported by all EDI-INT applications and could cause potential 
   problems with implementations.

1. 
   Introduction 
    
   EDI-INT applications provide for a secure means of payload document 
   transport. The original intent was for transport of a single EDI or

   XML document. However, as AS1 [AS1], AS2 [AS2] and AS3 [AS3] matured, 
   other features and application logic were implemented upon EDI-INT 
   standards. Since these features go beyond but do not violate the 
   basic premise of EDI-INT, a means is needed to communicate to trading 
   partners features which are supported by the originating user agent. 
   The EDIINT Features header indicates the capability of the user agent 
   to support the listed feature with its trading partner without out-
   of-band communication and agreement. 
    
2. 
  EDIINT Features Header Syntax 
    
   The EDIINT Features header can appear in the header section of an 
   AS1, AS2 and AS3 message. Its BNF syntax is listed below. 
    
   Feature = "EDIINT-Features: " Feature-Name *("," Feature-Name) 
    
   Feature-Name = Feature-Token 
    
   Feature-Token = %d48-57 /  ; 0-9 
                  %d65-90 /  ; A-Z 
                  %d97-122 / ; a-z 
                  "-"        ; blank space " " is not allowed 
    
   The Feature-Token allows for feature names to be specified and can 
   only contain alphanumeric characters along with the hyphen. Feature 
   names are case-insensitive. 
    
3. 
  Implementation and Processing 
    
   The EDIINT Features header indicates the originating user agent is 
   capable of supporting the features listed. The feature header MUST be 
   present in all messages transmitted by the user agent and not just 
   messages which utilize the feature. Upon examination of the feature 
   header, the trading partner SHOULD assume the user agent is capable 
   of receiving messages utilizing any of the features listed. 
    
   The features listed MUST be supported by existing IETF RFC or RFC-
   track Internet-draft standards. These standards MUST describe the 
   feature name which is listed in the header and the means which it 
   should be used. 
    
4. 
  EDI-INT Applications 
    
   Since AS1 uses email and the EDIINT Features header is not a 
   registered header with IANA, the header MUST be preceded by a "X-" to 
   be used. If the receiving trading partner does not support EDIINT 
   Features, it can choose to ignore the header because of the "X-". 
   Because AS2 and AS3 utilize transports of HTTP and FTP, respectively, 
   which allow the application to ignore headers which it does not

   recognize, the addition of the EDIINT Features header in AS2 and AS3 
   can be done without affecting trading partners who have not 
   implemented the header. 
    
   AS2 and AS3 applications currently use a version header, AS2-Version 
   and AS3-Version, respectively, to indicate functional support. The 
   EDIINT Features header tremendously improves the purpose and function 
   of the old version header. However, to provide a connection from the 
   old version header and the EDIINT Features header, AS2 and AS3 
   applications which implement the EDIINT Features header MUST use the 
   version value of "1.2" to indicate the support of the Feature header. 
   Also, since version "1.1" indicates the implementation supports 
   compression [COMPRESS] and "1.2" builds upon "1.1", AS2-Version or 
   AS3-Version of "1.2" MUST support compression regardless of whether 
   it is mentioned as a feature in the EDIINT Features header. 
     
5. 
  Security Considerations 
    
   Because headers are often un-encrypted, it may be possible for the 
   feature header to be altered. Trading partners MAY consult out-of-
   band to confirm feature support.
