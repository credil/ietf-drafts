Internet-Draft              vCard KIND:thing                    May 2011


1.  Introduction

   Version 4 of the vCard specification [VCARD] defines a new KIND
   property for the type of entity that a vCard represents.  The "thing"
   value of the KIND property was removed from that specification, with
   the expectation it might be defined in a vCard extension.  This
   document defines such an extension so that vCards can be used to
   represent things like physical objects and software applications.


2.  Meaning

   When the KIND property has a value of "thing", the vCard represents a
   physical object (e.g., a building, a vehicle, or a machine) or a
   software application (e.g., an application server, client, or bot).
   As one example of the "thing" KIND, vCards are currently used in the
   Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol [XMPP] to represent
   instant messaging servers that are deployed on the network.

   Although it might be desirable to define a more fine-grained taxonomy
   of things (e.g., a KIND of "thing" with a subtype of "vehicle"), such
   a taxonomy is out of scope for this document.

   The following base properties make sense for vCards that represent
   things (this list is not exhaustive, and other properties might be
   applicable as well):

   o  ADR
   o  EMAIL
   o  FN
   o  GEO
   o  IMPP
   o  KEY
   o  KIND
   o  LANG
   o  LOGO
   o  NOTE
   o  ORG
   o  PHOTO
   o  REV
   o  SOURCE
   o  TEL
   o  TZ
   o  URL

   Because things do not have work places and personal lives, it makes
   no sense to use the "work" and "home" values of the TYPE parameter in
   a thing's vCard (see Section 5.6 of [VCARD]).

Internet-Draft              vCard KIND:thing                    May 2011


   The properties in a thing's vCard apply to one of the following:

   o  The thing itself (e.g., the FN property might represent the
      friendly name of an application service, the URL property might
      represent a website that contains further information about the
      service, and the ADR, GEO, and TZ properties might represent the
      physical address, geographical location, and timezone of the
      machine where the service is hosted).

   o  An organization or person that owns the thing (e.g., the LOGO
      property might represent the corporate logo of a service
      provider).

   o  A person or role that controls the thing (e.g., the TEL, EMAIL,
      and IMPP properties might represent ways to contact a server
      administrator).


3.  Example

   The following example of an XMPP server is borrowed from [XMPP-VCARD]
   and uses the XML representation of vCard described in [VCARDXML].

   <vcard xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:vcard-4.0">
     <fn><text>jabber.org IM service</text></fn>
     <url><uri>http://www.jabber.org/</uri></url>
     <lang>
       <parameters><pref>1</pref></parameters>
       <language-tag>en</language-tag>
     </lang>
     <email><text>xmpp@jabber.org</text></email>
     <impp><uri>xmpp:jabber.org</uri></impp>
     <logo><uri>http://www.jabber.org/images/logo.png</uri></logo>
     <geo><uri>geo:42.25,-91.05</uri></geo>
     <tz><text>America/Chicago</text></tz>
     <source><uri>xmpp:jabber.org?vcard</uri></source>
     <rev><timestamp>19990104T122100Z</timestamp></rev>
     <kind><text>thing</text></kind>
   </vcard>


4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add "thing" to the registry of property
   values for vCard4.  In conformance with Section 10.2.6 of [VCARD],
   the registration is as follows, where the reference is to RFCXXXX.

Internet-Draft              vCard KIND:thing                    May 2011


   Value:  thing
   Purpose:  The entity represented by the vCard is a physical object
      (e.g., a building, a vehicle, or a machine) or a software
      application (e.g., an application server, client, or bot).
   Conformance:  This value can be used with the "KIND" property.
   Example:  See Section 3 of RFCXXXX.


5.  Security Considerations

   Use of vCards to represent physical objects and software applications
   is not envisioned to introduce security considerations beyond those
   specified for vCards in [VCARD].
