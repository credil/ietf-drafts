Internet-Draft    LDAP schema for storing SCRAM secrets     October 2008


1.  Overview

   ( [[OID TBD by IANA]]
           NAME 'saslSecretScram'
           DESC 'SCRAM mechanism secret'
           EQUALITY octetStringMatch
           SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 )

   The saslSecretScram attribute is a dollar ("$") separated octet
   string that contains information relevant for SCRAM [SCRAM]
   authentication.  The syntax of the string is as follows:

      Hashing mechanism name, currently always "hmac-sha1". [[anchor2:
      Add a reference to the IANA registry.]]

      Iteration count.

      base-64 [[anchor3: Add reference]] encoded salt.

      base-64 [[anchor4: Add reference]] encoded StoredKey [SCRAM].

      base-64 [[anchor5: Add reference]] encoded ServerKey [SCRAM].

   Syntax of the attribute can be expressed using ABNF [RFC5234]:

       scram-secret = hash-mech "$" iter-count "$" salt "$"
                      stored-key "$" server-key

       hash-mech    = "hmac-sha1"

       iter-count   = %x30-39 *DIGIT
                      ; a positive number without leading zeros

       salt         = <<base-64 encoded value>>

       stored-key   = <<base-64 encoded value>>

       server-key   = <<base-64 encoded value>>

   [[anchor6: Add an example.]]

   This attribute is multivalued.  For example, it may contain multiple
   SCRAM hashes for different hashing algorithms.


2.  Security Considerations

   Servers MUST validate format of the saslSecretScram attribute before

   using it for performing a SCRAM authentication exchange.  It is
   possible that an attacker compromised the LDAP server or got access
   to the entry containing the attribute in order to exploit a
   vulnerability in the subsystem performing SCRAM authentication
   exchange.  Big iteration counts and invalid base-64 encoding are two
   possible (but not the only) exploits in the format specified in the
   document.

   [[anchor7: TBD.]]


3.  IANA Considerations

   [[anchor8: TBD - assign OID for the new LDAP attribute.]]
