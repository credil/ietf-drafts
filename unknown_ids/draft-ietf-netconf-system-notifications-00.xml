	The NETCONF protocol provides mechanisms to manipulate configuration
        datastores.  However, client applications often need to be aware
        of common system events such as a change in system capabilities, 
        which may impact management applications.
        Standard mechanisms are needed to support the monitoring of
        the system events within the NETCONF server.
