 Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile p2mp Shared Protection
              draft-liu-mpls-tp-p2mp-shared-protection-01

Abstract

   This document will describle two protection solutions to support
   protection of failures in p2mp path in MPLS-TP.  According to the
   protection Requirements in RFC 5654, there are requirements for
   MPLS-TP to support sharing of protection resources such that
   protection paths that are known not to be required concurrently can
   share the same resources.  In addition, there is a requirement for
   MPLS-TP to support unidirectional 1:n protection for p2mp paths.
   These requirements are further addressed in
   draft-ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk . so this draft will present proposed
   solutions .


   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
   Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
   Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include
   an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
   to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
   network as defined by the ITU-T.

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP p2mp shared protection           March 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document describes protection solutions for MPLS-TP p2mp paths.
   The first solution is based on extending 1:1 protection solution to
   implement 1:n protection by using a shared protection p2mp path when
   there may have defect in the working p2mp path.  A second solution
   uses a shared p2p bidirectional protection tunnel to protect the
   branch path of a p2mp working path when detecting defects in a branch
   path of some p2mp working paths to implement (1:1)^n protection.
   Both protection solutions satisfy and fulfill requirement 69 and 67B
   in [RFC 5654].  These solutions can't exclude 1+1 and 1:1 protection
   solutions for p2mp path in draft-ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk and
   draft-ietf-mpls-tp-linear-protection. it will be used to perfect the
   requirement of recovery for p2mp path.  If only 1+1 protection is
   used for p2mp path, there need to set up a disjoint protection path
   for each working path, This will increase the cost of maintaining and
   monitoring each of these paths (i.e. both the working and protection
   paths).  In addition, since the p2mp service must be transported on
   both the working and protection paths, more bandwidth resource will
   be consumed for the p2mp service .  Due to these limitations, it is
   neccesary to consider using shared protection resources for many
   working paths.

3.  p2mp shared protection solution

   This section describes two types of p2mp shared protection solutions.
   The first proposed solution utilizes one p2mp protection path to
   protect n p2mp working paths .  When a protected p2mp working path
   detects a defect, the leaf node of the p2mp working path will notify
   its own root node of defective message by RDI packet through out-of-
   band return path.  If there is no other higher priority protected
   p2mp working path or control command that requires the use of the
   protection path, then the defective p2mp service packet will switch
   to p2mp protection path to be transported.  All leaf nodes of the
   defective p2mp path will select protection path to receive p2mp
   service packets.

   The second proposed solution uses a p2p bidirectional protection
   tunnel to protect defective branch paths of many protected p2mp
   working paths.  When a defect is detected on a protected branch path
   of one p2mp working path, the leaf node which has already detected
   the defect will notify peer node of its own p2p protection path of
   defective message by extensive APS or PSC packet as the following
   figure 1.  As a result, the service will switch to the protection
   path to be transported ,so it will bridge both working path and
   protection path to be transported.  But the leaf node of the
   defective branch path in the p2mp working path will select the
   protection p2p path to receive the service packet.  But other leaf
   nodes will still receive the service packet from original p2mp
   working path.

   The two p2mp shared protection solutions separately implement 1:n and
   (1:1)^n protection for p2mp path, The following sub-section describes
   the protection switching methods in detail.

3.1.  1:n protection

   The 1:n protection solution should be similar to 1:1 protection
   solution described in [survivability-framework] to use one protection
   path to protect many p2mp service traffics.  However, in this
   mechanism since the protected traffics are transported by different
   working path.  Its implication regarding the p2mp protection path
   will be configured between the protection domain root node and all
   leaf nodes of protected p2mp working paths.  The operation of this
   solution is based on the root node of each working p2mp path SHOULD
   send CC-V OAM packet to all its own leaf nodes periodically.  When a
   leaf node of a p2mp working path fails to receive the CC-V OAM packet
   for a fixed period, The leaf node should generate RDI packet to
   notify its own root node of the defective message .  When the root
   node of the p2mp working path receives the RDI packet and knows some
   failure in one or more one branch path of the p2mp working path, it
   may send protection switch requirement control packet to the root
   node of its own protection path and access node of the p2mp service.
   When the root node of the protection path receives the protection
   switch requirement control packet from any root node of the protected
   defective p2mp working path The root node of the protection path MUST
   choose one defective path to be protected based on the priority of
   these protected defective p2mp working paths.  Then the root node of
   protection path SHALL generate extensive APS or PSC packet that
   includes the selected p2mp defective path identifier in a TLV field
   of the message packet .The following figure 1 is the format of
   extensive APS or PSC packet .Then it will send the extensive APS or
   PSC message to all leaf nodes of the p2mp protection path .

   NOTE:

   P2MP LSP ID TLV: a standard TLV frame structure. including Type ,
   Length,and Value, and the value field may be identifier of p2mp LSP
   which have defect and should need to be protected. this p2mp LSP ID
   TLV format is as the following figure 2

   At the same time, the root node of protection path generates notify
   message control packet and send it to the root node of each defective
   p2mp working path by control channel ,so the root node of each
   defective p2mp working path can know whether it may be selected to be
   protected based on the notify message control packet.  If it has
   already been selected to be protected, it will stop sending service
   packet in the p2mp working path Then the protected service will
   switch to the p2mp protection path to be transported.

   On the other hand, all leaf nodes of the protection path receive the
   extension APS or PSC message from the protection path.  Then they
   will know whether to accept and process the service packet from the
   protection path based on p2mp LSP ID TLV field in the extensive APS
   or PSC packet.  If the leaf node is one sink node of the protected
   service, it will accept and process the service packet from the
   protection path.  Or else, it will drop the service packet.

   the implement in detail as the following figure is 1:2(n=2)
   protection instance.

   For the above p2mp network topology , there are two different p2mp
   services which need to be transported separately by p2mp working path

   2(r2- p2mp path 2-L2,L3)identified by ($) . under normal situation.
   the p2mp service from root node r1 will be sent and transported to
   leaf nodes L1,L2 by p2mp working path 1, and another p2mp service
   from the root node r2 will be sent and transported to leaf nodes
   L2,L3. in addition, only one p2mp protection path ( P-protection
   path-L1,L2,L3)identified by (@) is used to protect the p2mp working
   path 1 and the p2mp working path 2. supposing the protection priority
   of p2mp working path 1 is higher than p2mp working path 2. if there

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP p2mp shared protection           March 2011


   is a defect in separately branch path(r1-p2mp path 1-L1) of p2mp
   working path 1 and branch path(r2-p2mp path 2-L2) of p2mp working
   path 2, Leaf node L1 and leaf node L3 will separately send RDI packet
   to root node r1 and root node r2 by out-of-band return path. when
   root node r1 and r2 received the RDI packet and processed it. then
   the control packet of protection switch requirement will be sent to
   the root node P of protection path by control channel .  Then the
   root node P will choose one working path to be protected.  As the
   priority of p2mp working path 1 is higher than p2mp working path 2.
   so the root node P of protection path will select p2mp working path 1
   to be protected, and send extensive APS or PSC packet including p2mp
   LSP ID TLV to all Leaf nodes(L1,L2,L3) of the protection path.  At
   the same time, It will generate response control packet for the
   protection switch requirement of the root node r1 and r2. the service
   of the working path 1 will be selected to be protected.  So the root
   node r1 of working path 1 will stop sending its p2mp service in the
   working path 1, Then the service of the working path 1 will switch to
   the protection path to be transported. on the other hand, for leaf
   nodes( L1,L2,L3), when they received the extensive APS or PSC packet
   from the root node P, They will decide whether to accept and process
   the service packet from the protection path.  As leaf nodes(L1,L2)
   are the leaf nodes of p2mp working path 1, they will both accept and
   process the service packet from the p2mp protection path. but for
   leaf node L3, as it is not the leaf node of p2mp working path 1. it
   will drop the service packet from the p2mp protection path.  While
   the service of p2mp working path 2 can't be selected to be protected,
   so the root node r2 will continue to send their own service packet by
   p2mp working path 2.


3.2.  (1:1)^n protection

   This protection solution can use p2p bidirectional protection tunnel
   to protect some branch paths of many p2mp working paths which have
   the same leaf node .  Under normal situation, the root node of each
   p2mp working path will periodically send CC-V OAM packet to its own
   leaf nodes by the p2mp working path to detect defect .In order to
   protect each branch path of the p2mp working path, Firstly a
   bidirectional protection p2p path will be pre-configured between
   source protection node and the leaf node of the protected p2mp
   working path . in addtion, using an unique adress identifier
   including IP multicast address,mpls label etc can identify which
   service is tranported in the protection p2p tunnel. when some leaf
   nodes detect defect on some branch path of the p2mp working path, it
   would generate extensive APS or PSC packet Just as the above figure 1
   and send it to source protection node . the source protection node
   received the the packet , it will compare the priority of these
   defective working path.  Then it selects the highest priority service

   to be protected and encapsulate the protected service PDU by an
   unique adress identifier , then it will be sent to the leaf node of
   the defective branch path.

   for example, there is a (1:1)^2(n=2) protection instance as the
   following figure 4:

   there are two p2mp working paths : p2mp working path 1(r1-p2mp Path
   1-L1,L2) identified by ($) and p2mp working path 2(r2-p2mp Path
   2-L2,L3) identified by (#).in order to protect the service, a
   bidirectional p2p protection tunnel will be pre-configured between
   each leaf node(L1,L2,L3) and its own source protection node(P). so it
   need to configure three p2p protection tunnels identified by (@) in
   the figure

   extensive APS or PSC packet including p2mp LSP identifier and send it
   to source protection node(P). while the source protection node(P)
   received the extensive APS or PSC packet from the Leaf node L2, it
   will select higher priority service to be protected and encapsulate

   the protected service packet by an unique address identifier(IP
   Multicast address, mpls label etc) and be trasnported through the p2p
   protection tunnel(P-L2).  As the priority of the p2mp working path 1
   is higher than the p2mp working path 2.  The source protection node
   (P) will select the service of the p2mp working path 1 to be
   protected and encapsulate it by the its own unique address identifier
   . then the protected service of the p2mp working path 1 will be sent
   by the p2p protection tunnel. at the same time, the leaf node L2 will
   select the protection tunnel to receive service packet and be based
   on the unique address identifier to judge which service is
   transported by p2p protection tunnel now. so that the leaf node L2
   can process truely the service packet .

3.3.   Conclusion

   The two types of p2mp protection solution will individually implement
   1:n and (1:1)^n protection for p2mp service.  They can fulfill the
   requirement of unidirectional p2mp protection and sharing protection
   resource. in addition, the first solution need a special out-of-band
   return path to send failure message to the root node of p2mp working
   path. while for the second protection solution, as its protection
   path is bidirectional , it is unnecessary to set up out-of-band
   return path for sending failure message. .




4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the authentication TLV need further
   study.


5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
