                    MPLS-TP Control Plane Framework

              draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework-05.txt

Abstract

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) supports static provisioning
   of transport paths via a Network Management System (NMS), and
   dynamic provisioning of transport paths via a control plane. This
   document provides the framework for MPLS-TP dynamic provisioning,
   and covers control plane addressing, routing, path computation,
   signaling, traffic engineering, and path recovery.  MPLS-TP uses
   GMPLS as the control plane for MPLS-TP LSPs.  MPLS-TP also uses
   the Pseudowire (PW) control plane for Pseudowires (PWs).
   Management plane functions are out of scope of this document.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge
   (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
   of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.

   This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF
   Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an IETF
   Last Call.

   [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and
   insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published
   RFC has IETF consensus.]

1. Introduction

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is being defined in a joint
   effort between the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and
   the IETF.  The requirements for MPLS-TP are defined in the
   requirements document, see [RFC5654].  These requirements state that
   "A solution MUST be provided to support dynamic provisioning of MPLS-
   TP transport paths via a control plane."  This document provides the
   framework for such dynamic provisioning.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications

   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functions of a packet transport network as defined
   by the ITU-T.


1.1. Scope

   This document covers the control plane functions involved in
   establishing MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and Pseudowires
   (PWs).  The control plane requirements for MPLS-TP are defined in the
   MPLS-TP requirements document [RFC5654]. These requirements define
   the role of the control plane in MPLS-TP.  In particular, Section 2.4
   of [RFC5654] and portions of the remainder of Section 2 of [RFC5654]
   provide specific control plane requirements.

   The LSPs provided by MPLS-TP are used as a server layer for IP, MPLS
   and PWs, as well as other tunneled MPLS-TP LSPs. The PWs are used to
   carry client signals other than IP or MPLS. The relationship between
   PWs and MPLS-TP LSPs is exactly the same as between PWs and MPLS LSPs
   in an MPLS Packet Switched Network (PSN). The PW encapsulation over
   MPLS-TP LSPs used in MPLS-TP networks is also the same as for PWs
   over MPLS in an MPLS network. MPLS-TP also defines protection and
   restoration (or, collectively, recovery) functions, see [RFC5654] and
   [RFC4427]. The MPLS-TP control plane provides methods to establish,
   remove and control MPLS-TP LSPs and PWs.  This includes control of
   data plane, OAM and recovery functions.

   A general framework for MPLS-TP has been defined in [RFC5921], and a
   survivability framework for MPLS-TP has been defined in [TP-SURVIVE].
   These documents scope the approaches and protocols that are the
   foundation of MPLS-TP.  Notably, Section 3.5 of [RFC5921] scopes the
   IETF protocols that serve as the foundation of the MPLS-TP control
   plane.  The PW control plane is based on the existing PW control
   plane, see [RFC4447], and the PW end-to-end (PWE3) architecture, see
   [RFC3985].  The LSP control plane is based on Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS), see [RFC3945], which is built on MPLS Traffic Engineering
   (TE) and its numerous extensions. [TP-SURVIVE] focuses on the
   recovery functions that must be supported within MPLS-TP. It does not
   specify which control plane mechanisms are to be used.

   The remainder of this document discusses the impact of the MPLS-TP
   requirements on the GMPLS signaling and routing protocols that are
   used to control MPLS-TP LSPs, and on the control of PWs as specified
   in [RFC4447], [SEGMENTED-PW], and [MS-PW-DYNAMIC].

1.2. Basic Approach

   The basic approach taken in defining the MPLS-TP Control Plane
   framework is:

      1) MPLS technology as defined by the IETF is the foundation for
         the MPLS Transport Profile.
      2) The data plane for MPLS-TP is a standard MPLS data plane
         [RFC3031] as profiled in [RFC5960].
      3) MPLS PWs are used by MPLS-TP including the use of targeted LDP
         as the foundation for PW signaling [RFC4447]; and OSPF-TE,
         ISIS-TE or MP-BGP as they apply for Multi-Segment(MS)-PW
         routing. However, the PW can be encapsulated over an MPLS-TP
         LSP (established using methods and procedures for MPLS-TP LSP
         establishment) in addition to the presently defined methods of
         carrying PWs over LSP based packet switched networks (PSNs).
         That is, the MPLS-TP domain is a packet switched network from a
         PWE3 architecture perspective [RFC3985].
      4) The MPLS-TP LSP control plane builds on the GMPLS control plane
         as defined by the IETF for transport LSPs.  The protocols
         within scope are RSVP-TE [RFC3473], OSPF-TE [RFC4203][RFC5392],
         and ISIS-TE [RFC5307][RFC5316].  ASON signaling and routing
         requirements in the context of GMPLS can be found in [RFC4139]
         and [RFC4258].
      5) Existing IETF MPLS and GMPLS RFCs and evolving Working Group
         Internet-Drafts should be reused wherever possible.
      6) If needed, extensions for the MPLS-TP control plane should
         first be based on the existing and evolving IETF work, secondly
         based on work by other standard bodies only when IETF decides
         that the work is out of the IETF's scope. New extensions may be
         defined otherwise.
      7) Extensions to the control plane may be required in order to
         fully automate MPLS-TP LSP and PW related functions.
      8) Control plane software upgrades to existing equipment is
         acceptable and expected.
      9) It is permissible for functions present in the GMPLS and PW
         control planes to not be used in MPLS-TP networks.
     10) One possible use of the control plane is to configure, enable
         and generally control OAM functionality.  This will require
         extensions to existing control plane specifications which will
         be usable in MPLS-TP as well as MPLS networks.
     11) The foundation for MPLS-TP control plane requirements is
         primarily found in Section 2.4 of [RFC5654] and relevant
         portions of the remainder Section 2 of [RFC5654].

1.3. Reference Model

   The control plane reference model is based on the general MPLS-TP
   reference model as defined in the MPLS-TP framework [RFC5921]. Per
   the MPLS-TP framework [RFC5921], the MPLS-TP control plane is based
   on GMPLS with RSVP-TE for LSP signaling and targeted LDP for PW
   signaling.  In both cases, OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE with GMPLS extensions
   is used for dynamic routing within an MPLS-TP domain.

   Note that in this context, "targeted LDP" (or T-LDP) means LDP as
   defined in RFC 5036, using Targeted Hello messages.  See Section
   2.4.2 ("Extended Discovery Mechanism") of [RFC5036]. Use of the
   extended discovery mechanism is specified in [RFC4447] Section 5
   ("LDP").

   From a service perspective, MPLS-TP client services may be supported
   via both PWs and LSPs.  PW client interfaces, or adaptations, are
   defined on an interface technology basis, e.g., Ethernet over PW
   [RFC4448]. In the context of MPLS-TP LSP, the client interface is
   provided at the network layer and may be controlled via a GMPLS based
   UNI, see [RFC4208], or statically provisioned.  As discussed in
   [RFC5921], MPLS-TP also presumes an LSP NNI reference point.

   The MPLS-TP end-to-end control plane reference model is shown in
   Figure 1.  The Figure shows the control plane protocols used by MPLS-
   TP, as well as the UNI and NNI reference points, in the case of a
   single segment PW supported by an end-to-end LSP without any
   hierarchical LSPs.  (The MS-PW case is not shown.)  Each service
   provider node's participation in routing and signaling (both GMPLS
   RSVP-TE and PW LDP) is represented.  Note that only the service end
   points participate in PW LDP signaling, while all service provider
   nodes participate in GMPLS TE LSP routing and signaling.

   Figure 2 adds three hierarchical LSP segments, labeled as "H-LSPs".
   These segments are present to support scaling, OAM and Maintenance
   End Points (MEPs), see [TP-OAM], within each provider domain and
   across the inter-provider NNI.  (H-LSPs are used to implement Sub-
   Path Maintenance Elements (SPMEs) as defined in [RFC5921].)  The MEPs
   are used to collect performance information, support diagnostic and
   fault management functions, and support OAM triggered survivability
   schemes as discussed in [TP-SURVIVE]. Each H-LSP may be protected or
   restored using any of the schemes discussed in [TP-SURVIVE]. End-to-
   end monitoring is supported via MEPs at the End-to-End LSP and PW end
   points.  Note that segment MEPs may be collocated with MIPs of the
   next higher-layer (e.g., end-to-end) LSPs.  (The MS-PW case is not
   shown.)

   is already included in GMPLS. Such separation is also already
   included in LDP as LDP session end point addresses are never
   automatically associated with forwarding.


2. Control Plane Requirements

   The requirements for the MPLS-TP control plane are derived from the
   MPLS-TP requirements and framework documents, specifically [RFC5654],
   [RFC5921], [RFC5860], [TP-OAM], and [TP-SURVIVE].  The requirements
   are summarized in this section, but do not replace those documents.
   If there are differences between this section and those documents,
   those documents shall be considered authoritative.


2.1. Primary Requirements

   These requirements are based on Section 2 of [RFC5654]:
      1. Any new functionality that is defined to fulfill the
         requirements for MPLS-TP must be agreed within the IETF through
         the IETF consensus process as per [RFC4929] [RFC5654, Section
         1, Paragraph 15].

      2. The MPLS-TP control plane design should as far as reasonably
         possible reuse existing MPLS standards [RFC5654, requirement
         2].

      3. The MPLS-TP control plane must be able to interoperate with
         existing IETF MPLS and PWE3 control planes where appropriate
         [RFC5654, requirement 3].

      4. The MPLS-TP control plane must be sufficiently well-defined to

      5. The MPLS-TP control plane must support a connection-oriented

      6. The MPLS-TP control plane must support traffic-engineered
         point-to-point (P2P) and point-to-multipoint (P2MP) transport
         paths [RFC5654, requirement 6].

      7. The MPLS-TP control plane must support unidirectional,
         associated bidirectional and co-routed bidirectional point-to-
         point transport paths [RFC5654, requirement 7].

     12. The MPLS-TP control plane must support bidirectional transport
         paths with symmetric bandwidth requirements, i.e. the amount of

     14. The MPLS-TP control plane must support the logical separation
         of the control plane from the management and data plane
         [RFC5654, requirement 15]. Note that this implies that the
         addresses used in the control plane are independent from the
         addresses used in the management and data planes.

     15. The MPLS-TP control plane must support the physical separation
         of the control plane from the management and data plane, and no
         assumptions should be made about the state of the data plane
         channels from information about the control or management plane
         channels when they are running out-of-band [RFC5654,
         requirement 16].

     16. A control plane must be defined to support dynamic provisioning

         provisioning of MPLS-TP transport paths. [RFC5654, requirement

     25. The MPLS-TP control plane must scale gracefully to support a
         large number of transport paths, nodes and links.  That is it
         must be able to scale at least as well as control planes in
         existing transport technologies with growing and increasingly
         complex network topologies as well as with increasing bandwidth
         demands, number of customers, and number of services [RFC 5654,
         requirements 53 and 28].

     26. The MPLS-TP control plane should not provision transport paths
         which contain forwarding loops [RFC5654, requirement 29].

         management within a server layer network are outside the scope
         of this document [RFC5654, requirement 31].

     29. In an environment where an MPLS-TP layer network is supporting
         a client layer network, and the MPLS-TP layer network is
         supported by a server layer network then the control plane
         operation of the MPLS-TP layer network must be possible without

         summarized information (such as SRLGs or reachability) between
         layers [RFC5654, requirement 35].

     33. The MPLS-TP control plane must allow for the identification of
         a transport path on each link within and at the destination
         (egress) of the transport network. [RFC5654, requirement 38 and

     35. The MPLS-TP control plane must be extensible in order to
         accommodate new types of client layer networks and services
         [RFC5654, requirement 41].

         associated with a transport path to be increased without
         impacting the existing traffic on that transport path provided
         enough resources are available [RFC5654, requirement 42].

     37. The MPLS-TP control plane should support the reserved bandwidth
         of a transport path to be decreased without impacting the
         existing traffic on that transport path, provided that the
         level of existing traffic is smaller than the reserved
         bandwidth following the decrease [RFC5654, requirement 43].

     38. Requirement removed.

         integrated control plane encompassing MPLS-TP together with its
         server and client layer networks when these layer networks
         belong to the same administrative domain [RFC5654, requirement
         49].

     44. The MPLS-TP control plane must support configuration of
         protection functions and any associated maintenance (OAM)
         functions [RFC5654, requirement 50 and 7].

     45. The MPLS-TP control plane must support the configuration and
         modification of OAM maintenance points as well as the
         activation/deactivation of OAM when the transport path or
         transport service is established or modified [RFC5654,
         requirement 51].

     46. The MPLS-TP control plane must be capable of restarting and

         be minimized (preferably no data plane reconfiguration will be
         required) [RFC5654, requirement 55]. Note, such transfers cover
         all transport path control functions including control of
         recovery and OAM.

         SURVIVE], provides additional useful information related to
         recovery.

     49. The MPLS-TP control plane mechanisms should be identical (or as
         similar as possible) to those already used in existing
         transport networks to simplify implementation and operations.
         However, this must not override any other requirement [RFC5654,
         requirement 56 A].

         mechanisms present in any client or server transport networks
         (for example, Ethernet, SDH, OTN, WDM) to avoid race conditions
         between the layers [RFC5654, requirement 61].

   P2MP-FWK] and [RFC5960]:

     94. Per-packet equal cost multi-path (ECMP) load balancing is
         currently outside the scope of MPLS-TP [TP-DATA-PLANE , section
         3.1.1., paragraph 6].

     95. Penultimate hop popping (PHP) is disabled on MPLS-TP LSPs by
         default. [TP-DATA-PLANE , section 3.1.1., paragraph 7].

         [RFC5659], shall be supported by the MPLS-TP control plane.
         MPLS-TP shall use the definition of multi-segment PWs as
         defined by the IETF [RFC5921, section 3.4.4].

     98. The MPLS-TP control plane must support the control of PWs and
         their associated labels [RFC5921, section 3.4.4].

         i.e., clients whose traffic is transported over an MPLS-TP
         network without the use of PWs [RFC5921, section 3.4.5].

            a. The MPLS-TP control plane must support the use of network
               layer protocol-specific LSPs and labels. [RFC5921,

         TE [RFC5392] and ISIS-TE [RFC5316] are used for routing
         [RFC5921, section 3.9].

         enable/disable OAM functions as part of service establishment
         [RFC5860, section 2.1.6., paragraph 1]. Note that OAM functions

         of the existing IP/MPLS and PW OAM protocols (e.g., LSP-Ping
         [RFC4379], MPLS-BFD [RFC5884], VCCV [RFC5085], and VCCV-BFD
         [RFC5885]) [RFC5860, section 2.1.4., paragraph 2].

    108. The MPLS-TP control plane must allow for the ability to support

         by default [RFC5860, section 2.2., paragraph 2].

    109. The MPLS-TP control plane must support the choice of which (if
         any) OAM function(s) to use and to which PW, LSP or Section it
         applies [RFC5860, section 2.2., paragraph 3].

   There are no specific MPLS-TP control plane security requirements.

2.5. Identifier Requirements

   The following are requirements based on [TP-IDENTIFIERS]:

    137. The MPLS-TP control plane must support MPLS-TP point to point
         tunnel identifiers of the forms defined in [TP-IDENTIFIERS,
         Section 5.1].

    138. The MPLS-TP control plane must support MPLS-TP LSP identifiers
         of the forms defined in [TP-IDENTIFIERS, Section 5.2], and the
         mappings to GMPLS as defined in [TP-IDENTIFIERS, Section 5.3].

    139. The MPLS-TP control plane must support Pseudowire path
         identifiers of the form defined in [TP-IDENTIFIERS, Section
         6.].




Andersson, et al              Informational                    [Page 24]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework-05.txt  January 7, 2011


    140. The MPLS-TP control plane must support MEG_IDs for LSPs and PWs
         as defined in [TP-IDENTIFIERS, Section 7.1.1].

    141. The MPLS-TP control plane must support IP compatible MEG_IDs
         for LSPs and PWs as defined [TP-IDENTIFIERS, Section 7.1.2].

    142. The MPLS-TP control plane must support MEP_IDs for LSPs and PWs
         of the forms defined in [TP-IDENTIFIERS, Section 7.2.1].

    143. The MPLS-TP control plane must support IP based MEP_IDs for
         MPLS-TP LSP of the forms defined in [TP-IDENTIFIERS, Section
         7.2.2.1].

    144. The MPLS-TP control plane must support IP based MEP_IDs for
         Pseudowires of the form defined in [TP-IDENTIFIERS, Section
         7.2.2.2].


3. Relationship of PWs and TE LSPs

   The data plane relationship between PWs and LSPs is inherited from
   standard MPLS and is reviewed in the MPLS-TP Framework [RFC5921].
   Likewise, the control plane relationship between PWs and LSPs is
   inherited from standard MPLS.  This relationship is reviewed in this
   document. The relationship between the PW and LSP control planes in
   MPLS-TP is the same as the relationship found in the PWE3 Maintenance
   Reference Model as presented in the PWE3 Architecture, see Figure 6
   of [RFC3985].  The PWE3 Architecture [RFC3985] states: "the PWE3
   protocol-layering model is intended to minimize the differences
   between PWs operating over different PSN types."  Additionally, PW
   control (maintenance) takes place separately from LSP signaling.
   [RFC4447] and [MS-PW-DYNAMIC] provide such extensions for the use of
   LDP as the control plane for PWs.  This control can provide PW
   control without providing LSP control.

   In the context of MPLS-TP, LSP tunnel signaling is provided via GMPLS
   RSVP-TE.  While RSVP-TE could be extended to support PW control much
   as LDP was extended in [RFC4447], such extensions are out of scope of
   this document.  This means that the control of PWs and LSPs will
   operate largely independently.  The main coordination between LSP and
   PW control will occur within the nodes that terminate PWs, or PW
   segments.  See Section 5.3.2 for an additional discussion on such
   coordination.

   It is worth noting that the control planes for PWs and LSPs may be
   used independently, and that one may be employed without the other.
   This translates into the four possible scenarios: (1) no control
   plane is employed; (2) a control plane is used for both LSPs and PWs;
   (3) a control plane is used for LSPs, but not PWs; (4) a control
   plane is used for PWs, but not LSPs.

   The PW and LSP control planes, collectively, must satisfy the MPLS-TP
   control plane requirements reviewed in this document.  When client
   services are provided directly via LSPs, all requirements must be
   satisfied by the LSP control plane.  When client services are
   provided via PWs, the PW and LSP control planes can operate in
   combination and some functions may be satisfied via the PW control
   plane while others are provided to PWs by the LSP control plane. For
   example, to support the recovery functions described in [TP-SURVIVE]
   this document focuses on the control of the recovery functions at the
   LSP layer.  PW based recovery is under development at this time and
   may be used once defined.


4. TE LSPs

   MPLS-TP uses Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) signaling and routing, see
   [RFC3945], as the control plane for LSPs.  The GMPLS control plane is
   based on the MPLS control plane.  GMPLS includes support for MPLS
   labeled data and transport data planes.  GMPLS includes most of the
   transport centric features required to support MPLS-TP LSPs.  This
   section will first review the features of GMPLS relevant to MPLS-TP
   LSPs, then identify how specific requirements can be met using
   existing GMPLS functions, and will conclude with extensions that are
   anticipated to support the remaining MPLS-TP control plane
   requirements.


4.1. GMPLS Functions and MPLS-TP LSPs

   This section reviews how existing GMPLS functions can be applied to
   MPLS-TP.


4.1.1. In-Band and Out-Of-Band Control

   GMPLS supports both in-band and out-of-band control.  The terms in-
   band and out-of-band, in the context of this document, refer to the
   relationship of the control plane relative to the management and data
   planes.  The terms may be used to refer to the control plane
   independent of the management plane, or to both of them in concert.
   The remainder of this section describes the relationship of the
   control plane to the management and data planes.

   There are multiple uses of both terms in-band and out-of-band.  The
   terms may relate to a channel, a path or a network.  Each of these
   can be used independently or in combination.  Briefly, some typical
   usage of the terms are as follows:







Andersson, et al              Informational                    [Page 26]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework-05.txt  January 7, 2011


     o In-band
       This term is used to refer to cases where control plane traffic
       is sent in the same communication channel used to transport
       associated user data or management traffic.  IP, MPLS, and
       Ethernet networks are all examples where control traffic is
       typically sent in-band with the data traffic.  An example of this
       case in the context of MPLS-TP is where control plane traffic is
       sent via the MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh), see
       [RFC5586], using the same LSP as controlled user traffic.

     o Out-of-band, in-fiber
       This term is used to refer to cases where control plane traffic
       is sent using a different communication channel from the
       associated data or management traffic, and the control
       communication channel resides in the same fiber as either the
       management or data traffic.  An example of this case in the
       context of MPLS-TP is where control plane traffic is sent via the
       G-ACh using a dedicated LSP on the same link (interface) which
       carries controlled user traffic.

     o Out-of-band, aligned topology
       This term is used to refer to the cases where control plane
       traffic is sent using a different communication channel from the
       associated data or management traffic, and the control traffic
       follows the same node-to-node path as either the data or
       management traffic.

       Such topologies are usually supported using a parallel fiber or
       other configurations where multiple data channels are available
       and one is (dynamically) selected as the control channel.  An
       example of this case in the context of MPLS-TP is where control
       plane traffic is sent along the same nodal path, but not
       necessarily the same links (interfaces), as the corresponding
       controlled user traffic.

     o Out-of-band, independent topology
       This term is used to refer to the cases where control plane
       traffic is sent using a different communication channel from the
       associated data or management traffic, and the control traffic
       may follow a path that is completely independent of the data
       traffic.

       Such configurations are a superset of the other cases and do not
       preclude the use of in-fiber or aligned topology links, but
       alignment is not required.  An example of this case in the
       context of MPLS-TP is where control plane traffic is sent between
       controlling nodes using any available path and links, completely
       without regard for the path(s) taken by corresponding management
       or user traffic.

   In the context of MPLS-TP requirements, requirement 14 (see Section 2



Andersson, et al              Informational                    [Page 27]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework-05.txt  January 7, 2011


   above) can be met using out-of-band in-fiber or aligned topology
   types of control.  Requirement 15 can only be met by using Out-of-
   band, independent topology.  Some expect the G-ACh to be used
   extensively in MPLS-TP networks to support the MPLS-TP control (and
   management) planes.


4.1.2. Addressing

   MPLS-TP reuses and supports the addressing mechanisms supported by
   MPLS.  The MPLS-TP Identifiers document, see [TP-IDENTIFIERS],
   provides additional context on how IP addresses are used within MPLS-
   TP.  MPLS, and consequently, MPLS-TP uses the IPv4 and IPv6 address
   families to identify MPLS-TP nodes by default for network management
   and signaling purposes.  The address spaces and neighbor adjacencies
   in the control, management and data planes used in an MPLS-TP network
   may be completely separated or combined at the discretion of an MPLS-
   TP operator and based on the equipment capabilities of a vendor.  The
   separation of the control and management planes from the data plane
   allows each plane to be independently addressable.  Each plane may
   use addresses that are not mutually reachable, e.g., it is likely
   that the data plane will not be able to reach an address from the
   management or control planes and vice versa.  Each plane may also use
   a different address family.  It is even possible to reuse addresses
   in each plane, but this is not recommended as it may lead to
   operational confusion. As previously mentioned, the G-ACh mechanism
   defined in [RFC5586] is expected to be used extensively in MPLS-TP
   networks to support the MPLS-TP control (and management) planes.


4.1.3. Routing

   Routing support for MPLS-TP LSPs is based on GMPLS routing.  GMPLS
   routing builds on TE routing and has been extended to support
   multiple switching technologies per [RFC3945] and [RFC4202] as well
   as multiple levels of packet switching (PSC) within a single network.
   IS-IS extensions for GMPLS are defined in [RFC5307] and [RFC5316],
   which build on the TE extensions to IS-IS defined in [RFC5305].  OSPF
   extensions for GMPLS are defined in [RFC4203] and [RFC5392], which
   build on the TE extensions to OSPF defined in [RFC3630].  The listed
   RFCs should be viewed as a starting point rather than an
   comprehensive list as there are other IS-IS and OSPF extensions, as
   defined in IETF RFCs, that can be used within an MPLS-TP network.


4.1.4. TE LSPs and Constraint-Based Path Computation

   Both MPLS and GMPLS allow for traffic engineering and constraint-
   based path computation.  MPLS path computation provides paths for
   MPLS-TE unidirectional P2P and P2MP LSPs.  GMPLS path computation
   adds bidirectional LSPs, explicit recovery path computation as well



Andersson, et al              Informational                    [Page 28]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework-05.txt  January 7, 2011


   as support for the other functions discussed in this section.

   Both MPLS and GMPLS path computation allow for the restriction of
   path selection based on the use of Explicit Route Objects (EROs) and
   other LSP attributes, see [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].  In all cases, no
   specific algorithm is standardized by the IETF.  This is anticipated
   to continue to be the case for MPLS-TP LSPs.


4.1.4.1. Relation to PCE

   Path Computation Element (PCE) Based approaches, see [RFC4655], may
   be used for path computation of a GMPLS LSP, and consequently an
   MPLS-TP LSP, across domains and in a single domain. In cases where
   PCE is used, the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP), see [RFC5440],
   will be used to communicate PCE requests and responses.  MPLS-TP
   specific extensions to PCEP are currently out of scope of the MPLS-TP
   project and this document.


4.1.5. Signaling

   GMPLS signaling is defined in [RFC3471] and [RFC3473], and is based
   on RSVP-TE [RFC3209].  CR-LDP based GMPLS, [RFC3472] is no longer
   under active development within the IETF, i.e., it is deprecated, and
   must not be used for MPLS-TP.  In general, all RSVP-TE extensions
   that apply to MPLS may also be used for GMPLS and consequently MPLS-
   TP.  Most notably this includes support for P2MP signaling as defined
   in [RFC4875].

   GMPLS signaling includes a number of MPLS-TP required functions.
   Notably support for out-of-band control, bidirectional LSPs, and
   independent control and data plane fault management.  There are also
   numerous other GMPLS and MPLS extensions that can be used to provide
   specific functions in MPLS-TP networks.  Specific references are
   provided below.


4.1.6. Unnumbered Links

   Support for unnumbered links (i.e., links that do not have IP
   addresses) is permitted in MPLS-TP and its usage is at the discretion
   of the network operator.  Support for unnumbered links is included
   for routing in [RFC4203] for OSPF and [RFC5307] for IS-IS, and for
   signaling in [RFC3477].









Andersson, et al              Informational                    [Page 29]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework-05.txt  January 7, 2011


4.1.7. Link Bundling

   Link bundling provides a local construct that can be used to improve
   scaling of TE routing when multiple data links are shared between
   node pairs.  Link bundling for MPLS and GMPLS networks is defined in
   [RFC4201].  Link bundling may be used in MPLS-TP networks and its use
   is at the discretion of the network operator.


4.1.8. Hierarchical LSPs

   This section reuses text from [HIERARCHY-BIS].

   [RFC3031] describes how MPLS labels may be stacked so that LSPs may
   be nested with one LSP running through another. This concept of
   Hierarchical LSPs (H-LSPs) is formalized in [RFC4206] with a set of
   protocol mechanisms for the establishment of a hierarchical LSP that
   can carry one or more other LSPs.

   [RFC4206] goes on to explain that a hierarchical LSP may carry other
   LSPs only according to their switching types. This is a function of
   the way labels are carried. In a packet switch capable (PSC) network,
   the hierarchical LSP can carry other PSC LSPs using the MPLS label
   stack.

   Signaling mechanisms defined in [RFC4206] allow a hierarchical LSP to
   be treated as a single hop in the path of another LSP.  This
   mechanism is also sometimes known as "non-adjacent signaling", see
   [RFC4208].

   A Forwarding Adjacency (FA) is defined in [RFC4206] as a data link
   created from an LSP and advertised in the same instance of the
   control plane that advertises the TE links from which the LSP is
   constructed. The LSP itself is called an FA-LSP. FA LSPs are
   analogous to MPLS-TP Sections as discussed in [RFC5960].

   Thus, a hierarchical LSP may form an FA such that it is advertised as
   a TE link in the same instance of the routing protocol as was used to
   advertise the TE links that the LSP traverses.

   As observed in [RFC4206] the nodes at the ends of an FA would not
   usually have a routing adjacency.

   LSP hierarchy is expected to play an important role in MPLS-TP
   networks, particularly in the context of scaling and recovery as well
   as supporting SPMEs.

4.1.9. LSP Recovery

   GMPLS defines RSVP-TE extensions in support for end-to-end GMPLS LSPs
   recovery in [RFC4872], and segment recovery in [RFC4873] .  GMPLS
   segment recovery provides a superset of the function in end-to-end
   recovery.  End-to-end recovery can be viewed as a special case of
   segment recovery where there is a single recovery domain whose
   borders coincide with the ingress and egress of the LSP, although
   specific procedures are defined.

   The five defined types of recovery defined in GMPLS are:
     - 1+1 bidirectional protection for P2P LSPs
     - 1+1 unidirectional protection for P2MP LSPs
     - 1:n (including 1:1) protection with or without extra traffic
     - Rerouting without extra traffic (sometimes known as soft
       rerouting), including shared mesh restoration
     - Full LSP rerouting

   Recovery for MPLS-TP LSPs as discussed in [TP-SURVIVE], is signaled
   using the mechanism defined in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873].  Note that
   when MEPs are required for the OAM CC function and the MEPs exist at
   LSP transit nodes, each MEP is instantiated at a hierarchical LSP end
   point, and protection is provided end-to-end for the hierarchical
   LSP.  (Protection can be signaled using either [RFC4872] or [RFC4873]
   defined procedures.) The use of Notify messages to trigger protection
   switching and recovery is not required in MPLS-TP as this function is
   expected to be supported via OAM.  However, its use is not precluded.


4.1.10. Control Plane Reference Points (E-NNI, I-NNI, UNI)

   The majority of GMPLS control plane related RFCs define the control
   plane from the context of an internal network-to-network interface
   (I-NNI).  In the MPLS-TP context, some operators may choose to deploy
   signaled interfaces across user-to-network (UNI) interfaces and
   across inter-provider, external network-to-network (E-NNI),
   interfaces.  Such support is embodied in [RFC4208] for UNIs and
   [RFC5787] for routing areas in support of E-NNIs.  This work may
   require extensions in order to meet the specific needs of an MPLS-TP
   UNI and E-NNI.


4.2. OAM, MEP (Hierarchy), MIP Configuration and Control

   MPLS-TP is being defined to support a comprehensive set of MPLS-TP
   OAM functions. The MPLS-TP control plane will not itself provide OAM
   functions, but it will be used to instantiate and otherwise control
   MPLS-TP OAM functions.

   Specific OAM requirements for MPLS-TP are documented in [RFC5860].
   This document also states that it is also required that the control



Andersson, et al              Informational                    [Page 31]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework-05.txt  January 7, 2011


   plane be able to configure and control OAM entities.  This
   requirement is not yet addressed by the existing RFCs, but such work
   is now underway, e.g., [CCAMP-OAM-FWK] and [CCAMP-OAM-EXT].

   Many OAM functions occur on a per-LSP basis, are typically in-band,
   and are initiated immediately after LSP establishment.  Hence, it is
   desirable that such functions be established and activated via the
   same control plane signaling used to set up the LSP, as this
   effectively synchronizes OAM with the LSP lifetime and avoids the
   extra overhead and potential errors associated with separate OAM
   configuration mechanisms.


4.2.1. Management Plane Support

   There is no MPLS-TP requirement for a standardized management
   interface to the MPLS-TP control plane.  That said, MPLS and GMPLS
   support a number of standardized management functions.  These include
   the MPLS-TE/GMPLS TE Database Management Information Base (MIB), [TE-
   MIB]; the MPLS-TE MIB, [RFC3812]; the MPLS LSR MIB, [RFC3813]; the
   GMPLS TE MIB [RFC4802]; and the GMPLS LSR MIB, [RFC4803].  These MIBs
   may be used in MPLS-TP networks.


4.2.1.1. Recovery Triggers

   The GMPLS control plane allows for management plane recovery triggers
   and directly supports control plane recovery triggers.  Support for
   control plane recovery triggers is defined in [RFC4872] which refers
   to the triggers as "Recovery Commands".  These commands can be used
   with both end-to-end and segment recovery, but are always controlled
   on an end-to-end basis.  The recovery triggers/commands defined in
   [RFC4872] are:
      a. Lockout of recovery LSP
      b. Lockout of normal traffic
      c. Forced switch for normal traffic
      d. Requested switch for normal traffic
      e. Requested switch for recovery LSP

   Note that control plane triggers are typically invoked in response to
   a management plane request at the ingress.


4.2.1.2. Management Plane / Control Plane Ownership Transfer

   In networks where both control plane and management plane are
   provided, LSP provisioning can be bone either by control plane or
   management plane.  As mentioned in the requirements section above, it
   must be possible to transfer, or handover, a management plane created
   LSP to the control plane domain and vice versa. [RFC5493] defines the
   specific requirements for an LSP ownership handover procedure.  It



Andersson, et al              Informational                    [Page 32]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework-05.txt  January 7, 2011


   must be possible for the control plane to provide the management
   plane, in a reliable manner, with the status or result of an
   operation performed by the management plane.  This notification may
   be either synchronous or asynchronous with respect to the operation.
   Moreover, it must be possible for the management plane to monitor the
   status of the control plane, for example the status of a TE Link, its
   available resources, etc.  This monitoring may be based on queries
   initiated by the management plane or on notifications generated by
   the control plane.  A mechanism must be made available by the control
   plane to the management plane to log control plane LSP related
   operation, that is, it must be possible from the NMS to have a clear
   view of the life, (traffic hit, action performed, signaling etc.) of
   a given LSP. The LSP handover procedure for MPLS-TP LSPs is supported
   via [RFC5852].


4.3. GMPLS and MPLS-TP Requirements Table

   The following table shows how the MPLS-TP control plane requirements
   can be met using the existing GMPLS control plane (which builds on
   the MPLS control plane).  Areas where additional specifications are
   required are also identified.  The table lists references based on
   the control plane requirements as identified and numbered above in
   section 2.

4.4. Anticipated MPLS-TP Related Extensions and Definitions

   This section identifies the extensions and other documents that have
   been identified as likely to be needed to support the full set of
   MPLS-TP control plane requirements.


4.4.1. MPLS-TE to MPLS-TP LSP Control Plane Interworking

   While no interworking function is expected in the data-plane to
   support the interconnection of MPLS-TE and MPLS-TP networking, this
   is not the case for the control plane.  MPLS-TE networks typically
   use LSP signaling based on [RFC3209] while MPLS-TP LSPs will be
   signaled using GMPLS RSVP-TE, i.e., [RFC3473].  The data plane of

   [RFC5145] identifies a set of solutions that are aimed to aid in the
   interworking of MPLS-TE and GMPLS control planes.  This work will
   serve as the foundation for a formal definition of MPLS to MPLS-TP
   control plane interworking.


4.4.2. Associated Bidirectional LSPs

   GMPLS signaling, [RFC3473], supports unidirectional, and co-routed
   bidirectional point-to-point LSPs.  MPLS-TP also requires support for
   associated bidirectional point-to-point LSPs.  Such support will
   require an extension or a formal definition of how the LSP endpoints
   supporting an associated bidirectional service will coordinate the
   two LSPs used to provide such a service.  Per requirement 11, transit
   nodes that support an associated bidirectional service should be
   aware of the association of the LSPs used to support the service when
   both LSPs are supported on that transit node.  There are several
   existing protocol mechanisms on which to base such support,



Andersson, et al              Informational                    [Page 36]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework-05.txt  January 7, 2011


   including, but not limited to:

     o GMPLS calls, [RFC4974].

     o The ASSOCIATION object, [RFC4872].

     o The LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object, [HIERARCHY-BIS].


4.4.3. Asymmetric Bandwidth LSPs

   [RFC5467] defines support for bidirectional LSPs which have different
   (asymmetric) bandwidth requirements for each direction.  This RFC can
   be used to meet the related MPLS-TP technical requirement, but this
   RFC is currently an Experimental RFC.  To fully satisfy the MPLS-TP
   requirement this document will need to become a Standards Track RFC.


4.4.4. Recovery for P2MP LSPs

   The definitions of P2MP, [RFC4875], and GMPLS recovery, [RFC4872] and
   [RFC4873], do not explicitly cover their interactions.  MPLS-TP
   requires a formal definition of recovery techniques for P2MP LSPs.
   Such a formal definition will be based on existing RFCs and may not
   require any new protocol mechanisms, but nonetheless, must be
   documented.


4.4.5. Test Traffic Control and other OAM functions

   [CCAMP-OAM-FWK] and [CCAMP-OAM-EXT] are works in progress that extend
   the OAM related control capabilities of GMPLS.  These extensions
   cover a portion, but not all OAM related control functions that have
   been identified in the context of MPLS-TP.  As discussed above, the
   MPLS-TP control plane must support the selection of which (if any)
   OAM function(s) to use (including support to select experimental OAM
   functions) and what OAM functionality to run, including, continuity
   check (CC), connectivity verification (CV), packet loss and delay
   quantification, and diagnostic testing of a service. As OAM
   configuration is directly linked to data plane OAM, it is expected
   that [CCAMP-OAM-EXT] will evolve in parallel with the specification
   of data plane OAM functions.  These documents do not yet cover the
   implications of SPMEs, including both dynamic creation and dynamic
   OAM function control.

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework-05.txt  January 7, 2011


4.4.6. DiffServ Object usage in GMPLS

   [RFC3270] and [RFC4124] define support for DiffServ enabled MPLS
   LSPs.  While [RFC4124] references GMPLS signaling, there is no
   explicit discussion on the use of the DiffServ related objects in
   GMPLS signaling.  A (possibly Informational) document on how GMPLS
   supports DiffServ LSPs is likely to prove useful in the context of
   MPLS-TP.


4.4.7. Support for MPLS-TP LSP Identifiers

   MPLS-TP uses two forms of LSP identifiers, see [TP-IDENTIFIERS].  One
   form is based on existing GMPLS fields.  The other form is based on
   either the globally unique Attachment Interface Identifier (AII)
   defined in [RFC5003], or the M.1400 defined the ITU Carrier Code
   (ICC).  Neither form is currently supported in GMPLS and such
   extensions will need to be documented.


4.4.8. Support for MPLS-TP Maintenance Identifiers

   MPLS-TP defines several forms of maintenance entity related
   identifiers.  Both node unique and global forms are defined.
   Extensions will be required to GMPLS to support these identifiers.
   These extensions may be added to existing works in progress, such as
   [CCAMP-OAM-FWK] and [CCAMP-OAM-EXT], or may be defined in independent
   documents.


5. Pseudowires

5.1. LDP Functions and Pseudowires

   MPLS PWs are defined in [RFC3985] and [RFC5659], and provide for
   emulated services over an MPLS Packet Switched Network (PSN).
   Several types of PWs have been defined: (1) Ethernet PWs providing
   for Ethernet port or Ethernet VLAN transport over MPLS [RFC4448], (2)
   HDLC/PPP PW providing for HDLC/PPP leased line transport over
   MPLS[RFC4618], (3) ATM PWs [RFC4816], (4) Frame Relay PWs [RFC4619],
   and (5) circuit Emulation PWs [RFC4553].

   Today's transport networks based on PDH, WDM, or SONET/SDH provide
   transport for PDH or SONET (e.g., ATM over SONET or Packet PPP over
   SONET) client signals with no payload awareness.  Implementing PW
   capability allows for the use of an existing technology to substitute
   the TDM transport with packet based transport, using well-defined PW
   encapsulation methods for carrying various packet services over MPLS,
   and providing for potentially better bandwidth utilization.

   There are two general classes of PWs: (1) Single-Segment Pseudowires



Andersson, et al              Informational                    [Page 38]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework-05.txt  January 7, 2011


   (SS-PW) [RFC3985], and (2) Multi-segment Pseudowires (MS-PW)
   [RFC5659].  An MPLS-TP network domain may transparently transport a
   PW whose endpoints are within a client network.  Alternatively, an
   MPLS-TP edge node may be the Terminating PE (T-PE) for a PW,
   performing adaptation from the native attachment circuit technology
   (e.g.  Ethernet 802.1Q) to an MPLS PW which is then transported in an
   LSP over an MPLS-TP network.  In this way, the PW is analogous to a
   transport channel in a TDM network and the LSP is equivalent to a
   container of multiple non-concatenated channels, albeit they are
   packet containers. An MPLS-TP network may also contain Switching PEs
   (S-PEs) for a multi-segment PW whereby the T-PEs may be at the edge
   of an MPLS-TP network or in a client network.  In this latter case, a
   T-PE in a client network is a T-PE performing the adaptation of the
   native service to MPLS and an MPLS-TP network performs pseudowire
   switching.

   The SS-PW signaling control plane is based on targeted LDP (T-LDP)
   with specific procedures defined in [RFC4447]. The MS-PW signaling
   control plane is also based on T-LDP as allowed for in [RFC5659],
   [SEGMENTED-PW] and [MS-PW-DYNAMIC].  An MPLS-TP network shall use the
   same PW signaling protocols and procedures for placing SS-PWs and MS-
   PWs. This will leverage existing technology as well as facilitate
   interoperability with client networks with native attachment circuits
   or PW segments that are switched across an MPLS-TP network.


5.2. PW Control (LDP) and MPLS-TP Requirements Table

   The following table shows how the MPLS-TP control plane requirements
   can be met using the existing LDP control plane for Pseudowires
   (targeted LDP).  Areas where additional specifications are required
   are also identified.  The table lists references based on the control
   plane requirements as identified and numbered above in section 2.

   In the table below, several of the requirements shown are addressed -
   in part or in full - by the use of MPLS-TP LSPs to carry pseudowires.
   This is reflected by including "TP-LSPs" as a reference for those
   requirements.  Section 5.3.2 provides additional context for the
   binding of PWs to TP-LSPs.

5.3. Anticipated MPLS-TP Related Extensions

   The same control protocol and procedures will be reused as much as
   possible. However, when using PWs in MPLS-TP, a set of new
   requirements are defined which may require extensions of the existing
   control mechanisms. This section clarifies the areas where extensions
   are needed based on the PW Control Plane related requirements
   documented in [RFC5654].



Andersson, et al              Informational                    [Page 41]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework-05.txt  January 7, 2011


   See the table in the section above for a list of how requirements
   defined in [RFC5654] are expected to be addressed.

   The baseline requirement for extensions to support transport
   applications is that any new mechanisms and capabilities must be able
   to interoperate with existing IETF MPLS [RFC3031] and IETF PWE3
   [RFC3985] control and data planes where appropriate. Hence,
   extensions of the PW Control Plane must be in-line with the
   procedures defined in [RFC4447], [SEGMENTED-PW] and [MS-PW-DYNAMIC].


5.3.1. Extensions to Support Out-of-Band PW Control

   For MPLS-TP, it is required that the data and control planes can be
   both logically and physically separated. That is, the PW Control
   Plane must be able to operate out-of-band (OOB). This separation
   ensures, among other things, that in the case of control plane
   failures the data plane is not affected and can continue to operate
   normally. This was not a design requirement for the current PW
   Control Plane. However, due to the PW concept, i.e., PWs are
   connecting logical entities ('forwarders'), and the operation of the
   PW control protocol, i.e., only edge PE nodes (T-PE, S-PE) take part
   in the signaling exchanges: moving T-LDP out-of-band seems to be,
   theoretically, a straightforward exercise.

   In fact, as a strictly local matter, ensuring that targeted LDP (T-
   LDP) uses out-of-band signaling requires only that the local
   implementation is configured in such a way that reachability for a
   target LSR address is via the out-of-band channel.

   More precisely, if IP addressing is used in the MPLS-TP control plane
   then T-LDP addressing can be maintained, although all addresses will
   refer to control plane entities. Both, the PWid FEC and Generalized
   PWid FEC Elements can possibly be used in an OOB case as well.
   (Detailed evaluation is outside the scope of this document). The PW
   Label allocation and exchange mechanisms should be reused without
   change.


5.3.2. Support for Explicit Control of PW-to-LSP Binding

   Binding a PW to an LSP, or PW segments to LSPs is left to nodes
   acting as T-PEs and S-PEs or a control plane entity that may be the
   same one signaling the PW.  However, an extension of the PW signaling
   protocol is required to allow the LSR at signal initiation end to
   inform the targeted LSR (at the signal termination end) which LSP the
   resulting PW is to be bound to, in the event that more than one such
   LSP exists and the choice of LSPs is important to the service being
   setup (for example, if the service requires co-routed bidirectional
   paths). This is also particularly important to support transport path
   (symmetric and asymmetric) bandwidth requirements.



Andersson, et al              Informational                    [Page 42]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework-05.txt  January 7, 2011


   If the control plane is physically separated from the forwarder, the
   control plane must be able to program the forwarders with necessary
   information.

   For transport services, it may be required that bidirectional traffic
   follows congruent paths. Currently, each direction of a PW or a PW
   segment is bound to a unidirectional LSP that extends between two T-
   PEs, S-PEs, or a T-PE and an S-PE. The unidirectional LSPs in both
   directions are not required to follow congruent paths, and therefore
   both directions of a PW may not follow congruent paths, i.e., they
   are associated bidirectional paths. The only requirement in [RFC5659]
   is that a PW or a PW segment shares the same T-PEs in both
   directions, and same S-PEs in both directions.

   MPLS-TP imposes new requirements on the PW Control Plane, in
   requiring that both end points map the PW or PW segment to the same
   transport path for the case where this is an objective of the
   service.  When a bidirectional LSP is selected on one end to
   transport the PW, a mechanism is needed that signals to the remote
   end which LSP has been selected locally to transport the PW. This
   would be accomplished by adding a new TLV to PW signaling.

   Note that this coincides with the gap identified for OOB support: a
   new mechanism is needed to allow explicit binding of a PW to the
   supporting transport LSP.

   The case of unidirectional transport paths may also require
   additional protocol mechanisms as today's PWs are always
   bidirectional.  One potential approach for providing a unidirectional
   PW based transport path is for the PW to associate different
   (asymmetric) bandwidths in each direction, with a zero or minimal
   bandwidth for the return path.  This approach is consistent with
   Section 3.8.2 of [RFC5921] but does not address P2MP paths.


5.3.3. Support for Dynamic Transfer of PW Control/Ownership

   In order to satisfy requirement 47 (as defined in section 2) it will
   be necessary to specify methods for transfer of PW ownership from the
   management to the control plane (and vice versa).


5.3.4. Interoperable Support for PW/LSP Resource Allocation

   Transport applications may require resource guarantees.  For such
   transport LSPs, resource reservation mechanisms are provided via
   RSVP-TE and the use of DiffServ. If multiple PWs are multiplexed into
   the same transport LSP resources, contention may occur. However,
   local policy at PEs should ensure proper resource sharing among PWs
   mapped into a resource guaranteed LSP. In the case of MS-PWs,
   signaling carries the PW traffic parameters [MS-PW-DYNAMIC] to enable

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework-05.txt  January 7, 2011


   admission control of a PW segment over a resource-guaranteed LSP.

   In conjunction with explicit PW-to-LSP binding, existing mechanisms
   may be sufficient, however this needs to be verified in detailed
   evaluation.


5.3.5. Support for PW Protection and PW OAM Configuration

   Many of the requirements listed in section 2 are intended to support
   connectivity and performance monitoring (grouped together as OAM) and
   protection conformant with the transport services model.

   In general, protection of MPLS-TP transported services is provided by
   way of protection of transport LSPs.  PW protection requires that
   mechanisms be defined to support redundant Pseudowires, including a
   mechanism already described above for associating such Pseudowires
   with specific protected ("working" and "protection") LSPs.  Also
   required are definitions of local protection control functions, to
   include test/verification operations, and protection status signals
   needed to ensure that PW termination points are in agreement as to
   which of a set of redundant Pseudowires are in use for which
   transport services at any given point in time.

   Much of this work is currently being done in drafts [PW-RED] and [PW-
   REDB] that define - respectively - how to establish redundant
   Pseudowires and how to indicate which is in use.  Additional work may
   be required.

   Protection switching may be triggered manually by the operator, or as
   a result of loss of connectivity (detected using the mechanisms of
   [RFC5085] and [RFC5586]), or service degradation (detected using
   mechanisms yet to be defined).

   Automated protection switching is just one of the functions for which
   a transport service require OAM.  OAM is generally referred to as
   either "proactive" or "on-demand", where the distinction is whether a
   specific OAM tool is being used continuously over time (for the
   purpose of detecting a need for protection switching, for example) or
   is only used - either a limited number of times, or over a short
   period of time - when explicitly enabled (for diagnostics, for
   example).

   PW OAM currently consists of connectivity verification defined by
   [RFC5085].  Work is currently in progress to extend PW OAM to include
   bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) in [RFC5885], and work has
   begun on extending BFD to include performance related monitor
   functions.

5.3.6. Client Layer and Cross-Provider Interfaces to PW Control

   Additional work is likely to be required to define consistent access
   by a client layer network, as well as between provider networks, to
   control information available to each type of network, for example,
   about the topology of an MS-PW.  This information may be required by
   the client layer network in order to provide hints that may help to
   avoid establishment of fate-sharing alternate paths. Such work will
   need to fit within the ASON architecture, see requirement 39 above.


5.4. ASON Architecture Considerations

   MPLS-TP PWs are always transported using LSPs, and these LSP will
   either have been statically provisioned or signaled using GMPLS.

   For LSPs signaled using the MPLS-TP LSP control plane (GMPLS),
   conformance with the ASON architecture is as described in Section 1.2
   ("Basic Approach"), bullet 4, of this framework document.

   As discussed above in Section 5.3, there are anticipated extensions
   in the following areas that may be related to ASON architecture:

      - PW-to-LSP binding (Section 5.3.2)
      - PW/LSP resource allocation (Section 5.3.4)
      - PW protection and OAM configuration (Section 5.3.5)
      - Client layer Interfaces for PW control (Section 5.3.6)

   This work is expected to be consistent with ASON architecture and may
   require additional specification in order to achieve this goal.

6. Security Considerations

   This document primarily describes how existing mechanisms can be used
   to meet the MPLS-TP control plane requirements.  The documents that
   describe each mechanism contain their own security considerations
   sections.  For a general discussion on MPLS and GMPLS related
   security issues, see the MPLS/GMPLS security framework [RFC5920].

   This document also identifies a number of needed control plane
   extensions.  It is expected that the documents that define such
   extensions will also include any appropriate security considerations.
