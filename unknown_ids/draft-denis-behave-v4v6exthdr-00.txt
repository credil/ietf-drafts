Internet-Draft            IPv6v4 mapping option             October 2008


1.  Introduction

   To overcome the shortage of IPv4 addresses within the Internet,
   Network Address and Port Translators (NATs) have been widely
   deployed, such that multiple IPv4 nodes can share a single IPv4
   address.  However, that method is known to break certain application
   protocols, which need to know their own assigned external IP address
   and/or port number (i.e. the transport address).  New solutions are
   now under consideration which would extend NAT mechanisms such that
   IPv6 nodes could access the IPv4 Internet.

   This memo proposes an in-band method for such a IPv6-IPv4 NAT to
   notify affected IPv6 applications of the IPv4 transport address
   associated with any of their active communication flows.  A new
   option for the IPv6 Destination extension header, the Translated Flow
   Mapping option is hereby defined to carry this information.

3.  IPv4-IPv6 Translation

   An IPv4-IPv6 NAT performs two separate functions:

   o  It receives IPv4 packets on its IPv4 interface, translates them to
      IPv6.  To that end, for each IPv4 packet, it crafts a new IPv6
      header to replace the IPv4 header, may modify the inner transport
      protocol header.  Then, it sends the resulting translated IPv6
      packets through its IPv6 interface.

   o  Reciprocally, it translates IPv6 packets into IPv4 packets.

   The details of IPv4-IPv6 translation are beyond the scope of this
   document, please refer to [whatever IETF ends up specifying for this]
   instead.

3.1.  Inserting the flow mapping option

   When a translator receives an IPv4 packet, following certain
   conditions, it inserts an IPv6 Destination extension header
   containing a Translated Flow Mapping option (as defined in the next
   section).

   As a general rule, this option MUST NOT be inserted, if the resulting
   packet would exceed the known MTU to the IPv6 destination, or 1280
   bytes if there is no known MTU.

3.1.1.  Usage with connection-oriented protocols

   For connection-oriented transport protocols, this option SHOULD be
   inserted is part of the protocol handshake, and SHOULD NOT be
   inserted otherwise.

3.1.1.1.  Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)

   This option SHOULD be inserted within DCCP Sync, DCCP Sync/Ack and
   DCCP Listen packets.  See [RFC4340] and [I-D.ietf-dccp-simul-open].

3.1.1.2.  Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)

   TBD.

3.1.1.3.  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

   This option SHOULD be inserted within TCP SYN and TCP SYN/ACK
   packets.  See [RFC0793].

3.2.  Receiving the flow mapping option

   Processing of the flow mapping option is optional.  In fact, an IPv6
   implementation that does not support the flow mapping option MUST
   ignore it, according to [RFC2460] (this is not a new requirement for
   IPv6 implementation).

   The content of the flow mapping option is merely informational.
   Hence, there are no particular requirements as regards its
   processing.  An IPv6 stack that implements the flow mapping option
   MAY store and or forward the flow mapping informations, as it sees
   fit.  For instance, it might forward the informations to the
   application (see below for an example API) if it requests them.

                      Translated Flow Mapping option

   The Translated Flow Mapping option format is defined as follow:

   Option Type:  XXX (TBD: IANA)

   Option Length:  12 (12 bytes)

   Mapped Port:  If the type of the first header that is not an IPv6
      extension header is DCCP, SCTP, TCP, UDP or UDP-Lite, the
      transport protocol mapped port number.  This is the destination
      port number found in the original IPv4 packet that was translated
      into the IPv6 packet containing this option.  Otherwise, this must
      be set to zero by sender, and ignored by receivers.

   Mapped IPv4 Address:  Destination IPv4 address, as found in the
      origin IPv4 packet before translation.

   Remote IPv4 Address:  Source IPv4 address, as found in the origin
      IPv4 packet before translation.

   The Translated Flow Mapping option requires a 4n alignment (as
   defined per [RFC2460] section 4.2).

6.  IANA Considerations

   The Translated Flow Mapping option requires an IPv6 Option number.

   IPv6 Option Number [RFC2460]:

   HEX         act  chg  rest
   ---         ---  ---  -----
    XX          00   0   XXXXX     Translated Flow Mapping

   The first two bits indicate that the IPv6 node may skip over this
   option and continue processing the header if it doesn't recognize the
   option type, and the third bit indicates that the Option Data may not
   change en-route.

   This document should be listed as the reference document.

Appendix A.  API Considerations

   This section is non-normative.  It defines a potential API to
   retrieve the flow mapping information as an extension to the Advanced
   IPv6 socket API [RFC3542].

   The flow mapping informations shall be passed to applications using a
   structure defined in <netinet/in.h>, and containing at least the
   following fields:

   struct in6_ipv4flowmapping {
     struct uint16_t i4fm6_mapped_port;
     struct in_addr  i4fm6_mapped_addr;
     struct in_addr  i4fm6_remote_addr;
   };

                          Flow mapping structure

   For datagram (type SOCK_DGRAM) and raw (type SOCK_RAW) sockets, a
   socket option can configure receiving the flow information as
   ancilliary data on a per-packet basis, using recvmsg.  This socket
   option shall be set to 0 (off) by default.  Setting it to 1 (on)
   shall enabled flow mapping infos reception.  Setting it to -1
   (default) shall disable it.  When enabled, an ancilliary data with
   level IPPROTO_IPV6, type IPV6_IPV4FLOWMAPPING shall be returned to
   the application, if a Flow Mapping option was found in the received
   packet.

   int on = 1;

   setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_IPV6, IPV6_RECVIPV4FLOWMAPPING,
              &yes, sizeof(yes));

                         Per-packet socket option

   For a connected socket, a read-only socket option may be used to
   fetch the flow mapping information if known (i.e. if at least one
   packet with a Flow Mapping Option was received).  If unknown, the
   returned structure shall contain all zeroes.

   struct in6_ipv4flowmapping val;

   getsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_IPV6, IPV6_IPV4FLOWMAPPING,
              &val, sizeof(val));

                          Connected socket option
