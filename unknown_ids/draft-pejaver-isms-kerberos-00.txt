                  Keroberos Security Model for SNMPv3
                     draft-pejaver-isms-kerberos-00

Abstract

   This memo describes the use of Kerberos [RFC4120] service with Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to authenticate users, authorize
   them to access specific MIB objects and to encrypt data for
   confidentiality.  User authorization information is securely
   encapsulated inside the AuthorizationData field in a Kerberos ticket.
   The recommendations of this memo may be eventually extended to
   applications other than SNMP.

Internet-Draft     Keroberos Security Model for SNMPv3      October 2010


1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

2.1.  General

   This memo defines a Kerberos [RFC4120] based security model that
   supports centralized administration of user authentication and
   authorization, and data confidentiality via encryption for SNMPv3.

   SNMPv3 allows the definition of new security models.  The first
   security models [I-D.ietf-isms-radius-vacm] defined, USM and VACM,
   did not support centralized security administration.  Recent work
   based on session based approaches are not suitable for large networks
   containing untrusted managed devices.  A Kerberos based model was
   proposed earlier but did not go beyond the internet draft stage.
   This memo builds on the earlier proposal [draft-hornstein-snmpv3-ksm]
   and adds support for centralized authorization.

   Kerberos is a "trusted third party" security system.  It uses
   symmetric key cryptography (as opposed to PKI) and is simple enough
   to be implemented on small managed devices.  Once deployed in an
   enterprise network, it can provide a security foundation for many
   different applications.  However, deploying Kerberos in a large
   network is a significant undertaking and hence the model proposed
   herein may not be suitable for all organizations.

   This memo addresses security for SNMP GETs and SETs.  SNMP TRAPs can
   be secured in a similar way but are considered out of scope of this
   memo.  Lastly, this memo does not address details of the Kerberos
   server and the Authorization Database.

2.2.  Security Model Objectives

   The SNMP Architecture [RFC3411] lists the following well understood
   requirements:

   o  Modification of Information

   o  Masquerade

   o  Message Stream Modification




Pejaver & Lee             Expires April 7, 2011                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     Keroberos Security Model for SNMPv3      October 2010


   o  Disclosure

   The above requirements can be restated as the need for user
   authentication, message encryption and message integrity protection.

   In addition, there often are the following operational requirements:

   o  Granular Authorization: Some administrators may be authorized to
      modify MIB values, while others may be limited to only viewing
      them.  Further, some administrators may modify sensitive MIB
      values, while others may not.  Administrators' privileges may be
      reflected by the roles assigned to them, or by other authorization
      models such as permissions bits, privilege levels, etc.

   o  Centralized security administration: User credentials for both
      authentication and authorization need to be administered from a
      central point.

   o  Efficiency: Low end managed devices often have constraints such
      as, inability to save state between SNMP commands, and the lack of
      computational capability that is required to support PKI based
      protocols.  Also, SNMP messages are optimally exchanged using UDP
      as the transport.

2.3.  Kerberos Service Operational Model

   Kerberos uses the concept of shared secrets to allow principals to
   securely communicate with each other.  Principals may be human users
   (administrators) or hosts (managed devices.)  Each principal shares a
   secret key with the Kerberos server.  For human users, the key is
   derived from a password that is entered by the user.  For hosts, the
   key has to be securely stored on the host so that it cannot be copied
   or modified by potential attackers.  The key must be installed on
   each managed device.

   The managed device must be "Kerberized" and contains software that
   implements the Kerberos protocol and decrypts Kerberos tickets.  The
   workstation that runs the Network Management Application must be
   Kerberized to support Kerberos login and to save TGTs.  The Network
   Management Application itself must be Kerberized to get service
   tickets for each managed device before it sends a SNMP request.
   Kerberizing hosts and applications mostly involves inserting calls to
   the Kerberos library into existing code.

   The Network Management Application requests a service ticket from the
   Kerberos server by sending it a TGS_REQ.  It gets a TGS_REP in
   response.  It then constructs and sends the managed device an AP_REQ
   and gets back a AP_REP in response.

                                 Figure 1

   Figure 1 depicts the relationship between the major components of the
   proposed solution.  The dashed lines indicate message exchanges while
   dotted lines indicate a shared secret.  The administrator on a
   workstation should first login to the Kerberos server and obtain a
   TGT.  The TGT is cached on the workstation.  Subsequently, the
   Network Management Application uses the TGT to obtain service tickets
   for each Managed Network Device that it accesses.  It sends SNMPv3
   requests over UDP to the Managed Device.  The Managed Device uses its
   Kerberos secret to decrypt the ticket and extract information from it
   to securely complete the request.  The Authorization Database
   contains a mapping of acess privileges for each device for each user
   and is accessed securely by the Kerberos server.


3.  Proposal

3.1.  Outline

   The proposal is virtually identical to that made earlier in
   [draft-hornstein-snmpv3-ksm].  In the SNMPv3 packet header, the

Internet-Draft     Keroberos Security Model for SNMPv3      October 2010


   msgSecurityModel field will contain a new value indicating the use of
   the Kerberos Security Model.  The SNMPv3 msgSecurityParameters field
   will contain Kerberos AP_REQ in a SNMP request and will contain
   Kerberos AP_REP in a SNMP response.

3.2.  PAC

   The Kerberos ticket in the AP_REQ is expected to contain user
   authorization information, referred to here as a PAC (Privilege
   Attribute Certificate.)  The PAC is inserted into the encrypted
   ticket by the Kerberos server and cannot be modified by others.  It
   is an indication of the privileges assigned to the requesting user.

   A PAC will be the permissions for the specific user on the identified
   device.  Its structure and semantics may vary depending on the
   authorization model of the managed device.  Examples are:

   o  Privilege bits: { Read, Read-Sensitive, Write, Write-Sensitive,
      Reboot, ... }

   o  Privilege level: { 0 .. 7 }

   o  Role: { enum Admin, BackupOperator, OperationsManager, Auditor }

   o  Combination: Bits & Role

   A PAC can also define encryption requirements (encrypt payload or
   not) and whether "reverse authentication" and "reverse encryption" is
   required, though the securityLevel field may be preferred.

   The method used by the Kerberos Server to include the PAC is outside
   the scope of this note.

3.3.  SNMP Requests

   The Network Management Application will use the Kerberos library
   functions and previously obtained TGT to construct a AP_REQ.  This
   PDU is BER serialized and copied into the SNMPv3 securityParameters
   field.

   As described earlier in [draft-hornstein-snmpv3-ksm]:

   1.  If any securityStateReference is passed (Response message), then
       information concerning the state of the Kerberos protocol is
       extracted from the cachedSecurityData.  This typically includes a
       session key and client principal name.  This data is used to
       construct an appropriate KRB_AP_REP message.




Pejaver & Lee             Expires April 7, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Keroberos Security Model for SNMPv3      October 2010


   2.  Otherwise, the current Kerberos credentials available to the
       client, the Kerberos service name of "host", and the Kerberos
       localization information (which consist of a DNS domain name and
       optionally an IP address when using the IP suite) of the
       destination SNMP engine are used to construct an KRB_AP_REQ
       message.  This may involve contacting a Kerberos KDC if
       credentials for this service have not already been cached.

   3.  The resulting BER serialized KRB_AP_REQ or KRB_AP_REP is placed
       into the securityParameters field.

   4.  If the securityLevel specificies that the message is to be
       protected from disclosure, then the SNMP payload (the scopedPDU)
       is used as the payload of a KRB_PRIV message.

   5.  Otherwise, If the securityLevel just specifies that the message
       is to be authenticated, the SNMP payload (the scopedPDU) is used
       as the payload of a KRB_SAFE message.

   6.  The resulting BER serialized KRB_PRIV or KRB_SAFE message is
       placed as the msgData field.

   7.  The completed message with its length is returned to the calling
       module with the statusInformation set to success.

3.4.  SNMP Responses

   The Managed Device will use the Kerberos library functions and its
   stored secret to decrypt the AP_REQ message and extract the following
   values:

   o  Principal name of requestor: This value is the securityName and
      may be used for log messages.

   o  Session Encryption Key: Which is used by the library functions to
      decrypt the SNMP payload.

   o  PAC: which is used in the authorization decision.  VACM may be
      used as described in [I-D.ietf-isms-radius-vacm]

   The Session Encryption Key will be used if the response payload is to
   be encrypted.

   Lastly, if Reverse Authentication is requested, then the managed
   Device constructs a AP_REP PDU and inserts it into the
   securityParameters field.

3.5.  Integrating RADIUS & Two factor authentication

   Ideally, RADIUS and Two factor authentication should be invoked only
   once when the administrator is "logging in".  These services should
   not be invoked each time a different managed device is selected.  If
   RADIUS is the source of authorization information, then this
   information should be cached somewhere.  Alternatively, it can be
   inserted into the AuthorizationData field in the TGT.  Thereafter,
   this data can be copied from the TGT into each service ticket.


4.  Comparative Analysis

4.1.  Advantages of this Security Model

   o  Small Number of UDP Packet Exchanges.

   o  Managed Device can make an authorization decision without
      communicating with any other service.

   o  Managed Device does not need to retain any state information
      between SNMP requests.

   o  Compatible with VACM

4.2.  Disadvantages of this Security Model

   o  Does not support token based two factor authentication.  Kerberos
      does not currently support this capability.

4.3.  Issues with security models based on transport sessions

   One of the approaches to SNMP security is to set up a secure
   "transport" connection using SSH between the Management Application
   and the Managed Device.  Some of the issues with this approach are:

   1.  Setup overhead for ssh (and TLS) precludes short SNMP exchanges
       (like status polls.)

   2.  User authentication hits the RADIUS server for each device
       accessed.  Ideally, RADIUS should be invoked only once during
       user "login".

   3.  Every Managed Device needs to be configured as a RADIUS client.

   4.  Every Managed Device needs to be trusted since it sees user
       passwords.  It would be tempting for a hacker to spoof a Managed
       Device and steal the administrators' passwords.

Internet-Draft     Keroberos Security Model for SNMPv3      October 2010


   5.  Managed Device code is more complicated.  It has to retain much
       more state.

   6.  SSH (or TLS) uses public key cryptography during session setup,
       which is somewhat compute intensive.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The following IDs should be allocated:

   1.  SNMPv3 SecurityModel ID for Kerberos Security Model

   2.  Kerberos AuthorizationData type ID indicating that the content is
       a PAC.

   3.  Kerberos PreAuthentication data type indicating that the content
       is a PAC request.


6.  Security Considerations

   This model depends on Kerberos and inherits its security attributes.
   Major considerations are:

   1.  The secret keys stored on managed devices are often hard to
       protect and manage.  This is especially true when the devices are
       physically located in untrusted zones.  However, an attacker that
       copies the secret key is limited to impersonating the device and
       cannot affect other devices in the network.

   2.  The model depends on the Kerberos server being available online
       to generate service tickets.  If the server becomes unavailable
       then SNMP operations will be affected.  However, the Kerberos
       server can be replicated, and service tickets that have already
       been issued will continue to work until they expire.
