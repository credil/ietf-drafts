Abstract

   A method for obscuring location information is described.  Both
   static and changing location information can be obscured.  A single
   distance measure is input to the process; this parameter controls the
   precision of location information that can be extracted by a
   recipient.

Internet-Draft             Obscuring Location              November 2010


1.  Introduction

   A method for obscuring location information is described.  This
   method obscures location information such that it can be provided to
   recipients without revealing the location of the subject to within
   the desired distance.

   Obscuring location has applications for protecting privacy, as
   described in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy].

   This method uses a single configuration parameter as input: an
   _obscuring distance_.

   A location recipient (or recipient) is the entity that is given
   location about a target entity.  The goal is to ensure that the
   recipient is unable to recover location information with better
   accuracy than is desired.  Despite this obscuring the recipient
   should still be able to use the reported locations.

   The obscuring process takes a series of _known locations_, which
   might have greater accuracy than the recipient is permitted to
   receive.  The obscuring process produces a series of _reported
   locations_.


2.  Method Characteristics and Applicability

   The method described here is intended to provide limited protection
   for location information by constrained degradation.  The method has
   the following characteristics:

   Simple Configuration:  It might be possible to define a more complete
      solution for obscuring location information that is more
      configurable.  However, a more configurable option would also
      demand greater involvement from users so that they would be able
      to specify a configuration that meets their goals.  This method is
      designed to be easy to understand, which increases the chances
      that a user is able to successfully choose an appropriate
      configuration.  The method has just one input parameter: the
      obscuring distance.  A separate parameter for grid size is set by
      recommendation.

   Irreversible:  Obscuring is intended to be irreversible.  Information
      is lost by applying the process.  Multiple applications of this
      process to the same input location is could reduce information
      more than a single application of the process with the largest
      obscuring distance.

   Increases Uncertainty:  A recipient does not need to treat obscured
      location information any differently to location information that
      contains uncertainty.  The uncertainty of the reported location is
      increased so that the reported location includes the known
      location.  Thus, the information that is reported is correct,
      though the accuracy might be reduced.  This document relies on a
      definition of uncertainty for location described in more detail in
      [I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty].

   Two Dimensions:  The method described in this document operates in
      two dimensions only.  Many of the principles might be applicable
      in a higher number of dimensions, though no effort has been made
      to validate their integrity.  A three-dimensional location can be
      reduced to a two-dimensional form for use in this algorithm.  This
      is not contrary to the goal of reducing the amount of information
      provided.

   Time Invariant:  The method described in this document does not use
      time.  An entity performing obscuring does not need to consider
      time in applying this method.  Only the location is protected, not
      the time that the location was determined.  The time from the
      known location is included in the reported location.

   Obscuring Distance Not Secret:  No attempt is made to protect the
      obscuring distance as a secret.  It is assumed that a recipient is
      able to learn this value.

   Minimal State:  An entity that performs obscuring of locations often
      performs this service for the combination of many targets and
      recipients.  This process requires only that the obscuring entity
      hold maintain a trigger location for each recipient.  The
      additional state that an obscuring entity retains in order to
      apply this obscuring method is a small increment over what is
      typically required.  The current known location does not need to
      be retained; it need only be reacted to when it changes.  [TBD:
      determine an algorithm that removes the need for retaining the
      trigger location; this might be possible.]


3.  Obscuring Static Locations

   A static location doesn't change.  That is, different locations are
   not attributed to a single target at different times.

   The basic location obscuring case involves a single, isolated
   instance of location information.

   It might be appropriate to apply just this section in protecting the

   privacy of a single location.  A recipient must be unable to acquire
   multiple location instances for the same entity if this is the only
   form of obscuring used.

3.1.  Known Point Locations

   A known point location can be obscured by adding a randomized offset
   vector to the location.  The size of the offset vector is randomly
   selected so that the reported location could be anywhere within the
   obscuring distance of the known location, see Section 3.3.

   The uncertainty of the reported location is set to the obscuring
   distance.  This ensures that the reported uncertainty region encloses
   the known location.

   Note:  It's not sufficient to increase the uncertainty region so that
      it minimally includes the known location.  Doing this reveals that
      the known location is at the boundary of the reported uncertainty
      region.

3.2.  Known Locations with Uncertainty

   A known location with uncertainty is reduced to a circular
   uncertainty region (see [I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty], Section
   4.2).  An irregularly shaped uncertainty region is difficult to
   evaluate against the scalar obscuring distance, and it might
   inadvertently reveal more information than intended.

   A known location with uncertainty greater than the obscuring radius
   does not require additional obscuring.  The radius of the circular
   uncertainty region is compared to the obscuring distance to determine
   if further obscuring is necessary.  A location with sufficient
   uncertainty can be directly reported.

   Randomization is needed if the known location contains insufficient
   uncertainty.  As for a point location, an offset vector is added and
   the uncertainty increased to the obscuring distance.  A smaller
   offset vector is necessary where the known location has uncertainty -
   this vector need only be of a size up to the obscuring distance, less
   the existing uncertainty.

   The reported uncertainty is increased so that the reported location
   contains an uncertainty radius of at least the obscuring distance.
   An uncertainty in a known location cannot be recovered by a recipient
   of an obscured location unless it is larger than the obscuring
   distance.

      Paradoxically, more accurate location determination methods are
      better suited to obscuring.

      A location that is reported with uncertainty does not always have
      a uniform probability distribution.  A non-uniform distribution is
      not conducive to obscuring, since a location with an unevently
      distributed probability distribution reveals that the location of
      the target is more likely to be in specific parts of the
      uncertainty region.

      Information on the likely probability distribution cannot be
      conveyed in many systems, including presence (see [RFC4119],
      [RFC5491]).  The location determination method can be reported,
      which can reveal characteristics of the probability distribution.
      Specific measures to counteract this effect are therefore not
      feasible.

      Removing or replacing the location determination method parameter
      denies a recipient any information about probability distribution.

3.3.  Selecting a Offset Vector

   To select a random offset vector of up to a given size, select two
   uniformly distributed random numbers.  The first is used to select a
   random angle, the second to select a random distance.

   Assuming a "random()" function produces a number distributed between
   0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) - that is, the range [0, 1) - the
   angle and distance can be produced by the following:

         angle =  random() * 2 * pi
         distance =  sqrt(random()) * size
      or
         distance =  (1 - |random() - random()|) * size

   ...where "sqrt(x)" takes the square root of "x" and "|" takes the
   absolute value of the enclosed. "size" is the desired size of the
   random vector, which could be the obscuring distance less any
   existing uncertainty.

   A recipient that is able to learn the state of the random number
   generator could use this to determine the known location from a
   reported location.  A secure random number generator [RFC4086]
   provides an assurance that recovering the state of the random number
   generator is made more difficult.

Internet-Draft             Obscuring Location              November 2010


3.4.  Multiple Reported Locations

   Multiple applications of this algorithm produce different results.
   The intersection of multiple reported locations can be used to
   recover a better estimate of the known location.  This recovered
   estimate has less uncertainty than the obscuring distance, which is
   not desirable.

   Multiple reported locations for the same known location MUST NOT be
   produced.  An entity that is responsible for obscuring location might
   achieve this by storing the reported location with the obscured
   location.

   It is possible to implement obscuring for a static location without
   retaining state.  Seeding a pseudo-random number generator with data
   that is not available to the recipient can ensure that the same
   result is produced from the same input.  Taking a hash of the known
   location combined with a secret key ensures that this seed cannot be
   easily determined by a recipient.  A hash function that includes the
   values shown in Section 4.3.4 is sufficient for this task.


4.  Obscuring Changing Locations

   Applications that use the location of a target over time, such as
   presence [RFC4079] require additional steps to ensure that the
   location a recipient acquires does not reveal more information than
   desired.

   The first consideration is the frequency of updates.  As the target
   moves, the known location changes.  A continuous stream of reported
   locations could give a recipient sufficient information to determine
   the known location with low uncertainty in a fashion close to that
   described in Section 3.4.

   Note:  It is not necessary to ensure that a recipient always has
      accurate location information.  Early proposed algorithms wrongly
      assumed that the reported location was required to cover the known
      location at all times.  Even in the absence of obscuring, changes
      in location result in a recipient having outdated information.
      The only necessary constraint is that the location be accurate at
      the time that it is reported (or the time associated with that
      report).

4.1.  Update Conditions

   To limit the amount of information provided to a recipient, new
   reported locations are not generated in response to all changes in
   the known location.  The trigger for creating a new reported location
   can be defined.

   Any trigger condition needs to be constructed in a way that does not
   reveal information.  At the point that a new reported location is
   provided to a recipient, the fact that the trigger conditions are met
   at that point in time provides the recipient with significant
   information that could - if the trigger conditions were poorly
   defined - reveal significant information.

   The goal is to provide a new reported location when the known
   location moves by approximately the obscuring distance.  This limits
   the information that a recipient has available with similar accuracy
   to each individual location.

4.1.1.  Bad Triggers

   One potential trigger is the movement of the target outside of the
   reported uncertainty region.  At the point that a new reported
   location is generated, a recipient knows that the target is a) at the
   boundary of the last uncertainty region, and b) somewhere in the new
   uncertainty region.  The intersection of these two regions produces
   an area that is significantly smaller than desired.

   Similarly, information is revealed if the trigger is movement based
   on the known location.  A new reported location might be produced
   when the known location moves more than the obscuring distance from
   the known location from the last report.

      That is, when a new location is reported, the corresponding known
      location is saved.  A new reported location is determined when the
      current known location is more than the obscuring distance from
      the saved location.

   If the recipient is able to assume that the target is moving in a
   straight line, the speed of the target is revealed.

4.1.2.  Hidden Trigger

   To limit the information that is revealed at the point that a new
   reported location is provided, the trigger conditions can be based on
   information that is not available to the recipient.

   Applying randomization to the trigger reduces the ability of a
   recipient to make assertions about the significance of a new reported
   location.

   A hidden trigger is established using the following process:

   o  When a new reported location is generated:

      1.  The centroid of the known location is determined.

      2.  A random offset vector (Section 3.3) of a maximum size of half
          the obscuring distance is determined.

      3.  The offset vector is added to the centroid and this value is
          saved as a trigger point.

   o  When the known location changes:

      1.  The centroid of the (new) known location is determined.

      2.  If this centroid is further than the obscuring distance from
          the saved trigger point, a new reported location is generated.

   Each new reported location is randomized using the process described
   in Section 3.

   This algorithm ensures that the centroid of the known location moves
   between 0.5 and 1.5 times the obscuring distance before a new
   reported location is produced.  As a consequence, the uncertainty in

Internet-Draft             Obscuring Location              November 2010


   the distance moved is equal to the obscuring distance.

4.2.  Consecutive Reported Locations

   The obscuring method has a weakness that is as a direct consequence
   of the triggering conditions.  These conditions grant a recipient
   this information:

      For any two consecutive reported locations there is a pair of
      points that are less than 1.5 times the obscuring distance apart,
      with one point in the area described by each reported location.
      The first point is the known location at the time of the first
      reported location; the second point is the known location at the
      time of the second reported location.

   At the time that a location is reported, the recipient can use this
   knowledge to determine that the current location of the target is at
   the intersection of the new reported location and a circle with a
   radius of 2.5 times the obscuring distance, centered on the last
   reported location, as shown in Figure 2

   recipient can recover the location of the target almost perfectly.

   This relies on the recipient being able to determine the obscuring
   distance.  As identified, the obscuring distance is not protected.

4.2.1.  Reducing Variation between Offset Vectors

   This shortcoming can be addressed by reducing the difference between
   the random offset vector added to consecutive reported locations.
   The extreme case shown in Figure 2 only arises because the absolute
   difference between the randomization vector used for in consecutive
   reported locations is twice the obscuring distance.  The problem
   occurs when the difference between consecutive know locations
   approachs 1.5 times the obscuring distance in combination with this
   large difference between randomization vectors.

   Reducing the amount that a offset vector can change between
   consecutive reported locations reduces.  If the difference between
   offset vectors is constrained then the effect of this problem is
   reduced.

   Using the same offset vector for all reported locations removes the
   problem entirely.  However, using the same offset vector increases
   the chances of that vector being discovered.  For instance, if the
   target is following a road, reported locations that have a fixed
   offset from the known location will reveal the shape of the road.
   From this it is trivial to learn the offset vector and hence all
   presence and past locations can be recovered.

   Each time a location is randomized, the offset vector used can be the
   combination of a new random offset vector and the offset vector that
   was last used.  The proportion of old and new vectors determines the
   trade-off between the probability that a recipient is able to learn a
   more accurate location with the probability that a recipient is able
   to learn the offset.

4.2.2.  Trade-off in Reducing Variation

   A small amount of randomness at each stage makes it difficult to
   learn the offset vector.  A number reported locations are required to
   learn the offset vector.  Therefore, as long as the offset vector is
   able to change significantly over a number of reported locations, the
   goal is achieved, Thus, the offset vector need only change a small
   amount for each consecutive reported location.  This need only make
   it difficult to learn the vector and to make learning the vector less
   useful if it is revealed.

   In turn a smaller change in the offset vector maximizes the worst

   case area.  If the absolute difference in offset vectors is half the
   obscuring distance, then there is no gap between consecutive reported
   locations and in the worst case the recipient is able to determine
   the known location to be within 77 percent of the desired area.  This
   varies based on "r(diff)", as follows:

     a(diff) = ((1.5 + diff)^2 - 5.25) / (2*(1.5 + diff))
     r(diff) = acos(a(diff)) + 6.25 * acos((1.5 + diff - a(diff)) / 2.5)
               - (1.5 + diff) * sqrt(1 - a(diff)^2)

   ...where "acos(x)" returns the inverse cosine of "x".  This only
   produces a result where "diff" is less than 2.

   It might be useful in this case to create a offset vector that is no
   more than "diff" times the oscuring distance different to the
   previous vector.  This might be done by taking a weighted average of
   the previous vector with a new random offset vector as follows:

      o[new] =  (o[prev] * (2 - diff) + o[random] * diff) / 2

   ...where "o[new]" is the new ofset vector, "o[prev]" is the new
   previous vector, and "o[random]" is a completely random vector of the
   same magnitude.

4.3.  Returning to the Same Location

   A moving target might return to the same location several times.  The
   method described thus far produces a different reported location each
   time.  With some inferences, a recipient that is able to observe
   location over time could intersect reported locations to recover

   Furthermore, if known locations are not available before and after
   leaving the location that is frequently visited, only that location
   is obscured.  The known location could be readily extracted.

4.3.1.  Positional Stability

   The key to addressing this flaw is to have the randomization of
   offset vectors based on the known location.  If the same known
   location produced a reported location that was equal or very close to
   it each time that the location was obscured, this would address the
   problem.

   It might be possible to take the coordinates of the known location
   and pass them through a cryptographic hash function along with a
   secret key.  The result bits would be sufficiently random to produce
   an offset vector.  This would ensure that the exact same location
   would produce the same random vector.

Internet-Draft             Obscuring Location              November 2010


   The drawback of this sort of method is that the location is obscured
   inconsistently when even the slightest difference occurs in the known
   location.  Imprecision in the location determination method used
   frequently produces variations in the known location, making this
   approach not viable.

   The goal is to ensure that two known locations in close proximity
   produce a constant (or almost constant) random vector.  It is also
   desirable that the random vector change as the locations change.
   This has the consequence of reducing the difference in randomness
   between consecutive reported locations, provided that the random
   values do not vary significantly over a distance of 1.5 times the
   obscuring distance.

   It might be desirable if the random vectors changed over a longer
   distance, as Section 4.2.1 demonstrates.  If the offset vector
   changed over a period of approximately 4 times the randomization
   distance, the vector would change by no more than about 3/4 of the
   offset distance.

   An approach similar to that described in [PERLIN] is used to achieve
   a continuously varying random field.  In this, randomness is
   constrained to a grid of points with interpolation used to determine
   values for intervening points.

4.3.2.  Triggering with Positional Stability

   No specific changes are required for the triggering process, though
   this does require that some state be maintained by the entity that
   performs obscuring.  For a SIP entity that is maintaining a
   subscription, this is not expected to be onerous.

   The advantage of having a specific trigger for providing a new
   reported location is that it reduces the information provided to a
   recipient.  Providing updates at a higher rate provide a recipient
   with additional information that could be used to recover the offset.

4.3.3.  Selecting a Grid

   In selecting an appropriate grid with two dimensions, the curvature
   of the surface of the Earth presents a challenge.  The simplest
   approach might be to select an origin at latitude 0, longitude 0.
   Grid points could be placed at increments based on a constant ratio
   between latitude and longitude and distance; for example, 9e-6
   degrees per meter assumes a spherical planet of 6366197 meter radius,
   which is slightly smaller than the semi-major axis of the ellipsoid
   used in most Earth models.

Internet-Draft             Obscuring Location              November 2010


   Grid intervals can be set to a multiple of the obscuring distance
   that ensures that consecutive reported locations have continuously
   varying offset vectors.  Assuming that linear interpolation is used
   in "n" dimensions, a multiple of "m" produces a proportional change
   in the offset vector of:

      change = (1 - (m - 1.5 * 2^((3 - n)/2)) / m)^n

   For a two-dimensional grid with a multiple of "m", the following
   equations identify the latitude and longitude of the four nearest
   grid points to a given location:

      grid =  m * obscuring distance * 9e-6

      latitude[low] =  floor(latitude / grid) * grid
      latitude[high] =  latitude[low] + grid

      longitude[low] =  floor(longitude / grid) * grid
      longitude[high] =  longitude[low] + grid

   ...where "floor(x)" produces the nearest whole integer that is more
   negative than "x".

   The shortcoming of a grid of this nature is that changes in longitude
   are more rapid as locations get closer to the poles.  At
   approximately 60 degrees of latitude (North or South), grid intervals
   on the East-West direction are twice as frequent as desired.  For
   this reason, larger intervals between grid points might be chosen for
   longitudes.

   A solution for this problem is described in Section 4.3.6.  An
   alternative problem might select a local tangent plane removes the
   effect of the curvature of the Earth, though this introduces the
   problem of selecting an appropriate tangent plane as locations
   change.

      In three dimensions, conversion to Earth-centered, Earth-fixed
      Cartesian coordinates renders this problem moot.

4.3.4.  Random Grid

   At each of the points on the grid, a random offset vector is produced
   using the method described in Section 3.3.  The resulting offset
   vectors are interpolated as shown in Figure 3.

   Rather than use a random number generator, the random number should
   be produced using a cryptographic hash function.  The input to this
   hash should include:

   o  a random sequence [RFC4086] with the desired entropy that is only
      known by the entity that performs the obscuring,

   o  the identity of the target,

   o  each individual coordinate of the grid point, and

   o  as necessary, an identifier for the purposes of the random number:
      angle, distance, and (optionally) a second distance, depending on
      the method used to generate the random offset vector.

   The inclusion of a secret ensures that a recipient is unable to
   construct the offset vector.  This secret is persistent so that later
   applications of the obscuring formula do not produce a different
   offset vector for the same location.

   Section 3.3 requires that two or three random numbers are produced.
   The additional identifier produces additional randomness where
   multiple random (or pseudo-random) numbers are required.

   Using a hash in this fashion ensures that each target gets a
   different set of random offset vectors and that the same grid point
   coordinates produce the same result.

   Though ordering need only be consistent between consequent
   applications of the obscuring algorithm, the following might be used
   to produce random bits:

      random = H(secret key | target identity | identifier
                 | grid coordinate | grid coordinate | ...)

   ...where "|" represents concatenation, including a delimiter as
   necessary (that is, to delineate variable length values).

   Alternatively, the same sequence could be used to seed a secure
   random number generator [RFC4086].  Extracting values in the same
   order makes the "identifier" unnecessary.

   One consequence of this approach is that changes to the obscuring
   distance result in the noise pattern being completely changed.  This
   can result in the same known location producing a significantly
   different reported location before and after the change.

4.3.5.  Linear Interpolation of Random Offsets

   Once a grid of random offset vectors is established, an offset vector
   is calculated based on the centroid of the known location.  Figure 3
   shows a point at "(x,y)" and the values that are used in the

                       Figure 3: Grid Interpolation

   The offset vector at the identified point is produced by taking the
   weighted average of the offset vectors.  Two weighted averages are
   taken between pairs of adjacent grid points along the same axis, then
   the weighted average of the two resulting vectors is taken along the
   other axis.

   The following equations produce an linearly interpolated offset
   vector for any point in this grid cell:

      tx = (x - x1) / (x2 - x1)
      ty = (y - y1) / (y2 - y1)
      w1 = o[x1,y1] * (1 - tx) + o[x2,y1] * tx
      w2 = o[x1,y1] * (1 - tx) + o[x2,y1] * tx
      offset = w1 * (1 - ty) + w2 * ty

   ...where "o[x1,y1]" is the random offset vector at the grid point
   "(x1,y1)".

4.3.5.1.  Uniformly Distributed Interpolation

   A consequence of performing a weighted average is that the resulting
   value is not uniformly distributed.  Depending on the weighting
   factor (the value "tx" or "ty" in Section 4.3.5), the resulting
   probability distribution has a higher probability of producing values
   in the middle of the range of possible values.

   For example, the probability distribution for a weighted average of
   two uniformly distributed random numbers between 0 and 1 is shown in
   Figure 4.  The figure shows the case where "t" is less than 0.5,

   though the same distribution is produced for "t" and "(1-t)".

                                 Figure 4

   In order to correct for this skewing of results toward the middle of
   the range, a smoothed interpolation is used.

   Over the range from 0 to 1, the following produces a uniformly
   distributed interpolation between "a" and "b":

      r = a * (1 - t) + b * t
      IF r < t AND r < (1 - t) THEN:
         r = r * r / 2 / t / (1 - t)
      ELSE IF r > t AND r > (1 - t) THEN:
         r = 1 - (1 - r) * (1 - r) / t / (1 - t)
      ELSE IF t < 0.5 THEN:
         r = (2 * r - t) / 2 / (1 - t)
      ELSE:
         r = (2 * r - 1 + t) / 2 / t

   This maps a linearly interpolated value to a smoothed value, using
   the cumulative distribution function for the weighted sum of "a" and
   "b".  This mapping produces a value between 0 and 1 for inputs
   between 0 and 1.  The mapping is continuous.  The mapping is not
   monotonically increasing for some values of "a" and "b"; the intent
   is to have a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, not between "a"
   and "b".  Toward the middle of the range, a maximum gradient of 2 is
   possible.

   For convenience, this interpolation function is represented in
   shorthand throughout the remainder of the document:
   "uniformDistInterp(a, b, t)".

   This has similar characteristics to the smoothing function used in
   [PERLIN], except that the goal is not smoothing, but ensuring a
   uniform distribution of values in the output.  Values are continuous,
   but their first derivative is not.

4.3.5.2.  Applying Uniformly Distributed Interpolation

   The method for producing a random vector in Section 3.3 produces a
   result that is uniformly distributed in a circular area.  As a
   result, the cartesian coordinates produced are not evenly distributed
   on each axis.  Similarly, the polar coordinates have a non-uniformly
   distributed magnitude.  Rather than interpolate on the output of this
   process, the uniformly distributed interpolation is applied to the
   random inputs.

   Interpolation is performed on a set of random numbers that are
   produced at each grid vertex.  This is used to produce a single set
   of random numbers that are used as input to the algorithm that
   produces a random vector.

   One consequence of this process is that the angle of the random
   vector does not cross 360 degrees (2 times pi) when being
   interpolated.  In the worst case, interpolation between two points
   requires rotation through almost 360 degrees.

      The alternative method of interpolating angles - linear
      interpolation using the shortest path - does produce an uniformly
      distributed output, but it also produces a discontinuity that
      could be exploited by a recipient when interpolation is applied in
      more than one dimension.  It is possible to produce a change in
      the offset vector of up to twice the obscuring distance in size as
      the known location moves only a short distance.

4.3.5.3.  Selecting an Appropriate Grid Size

   Assuming the worst case, the maximum rate of change produced by the
   uniformly distributed interpolation doubles the rate of rotation.  If
   the magnitude of the offset vector was the maximum value at each end
   of the interpolation, the maximum absolute change in offset vector as
   a result of movement is:

      diff(m, d) = 4 * sin(d * pi / m)

   ...where "d" is the distance moved as a proportion of the obscuring
   distance, "m" is the number of multiples of the obscuring distance in
   each grid interval, and "2 * d < m".

   The maximum distance between consecutive updates based on the
   triggerring scheme is 1.5 times the obscuring distance.  With "d" set
   to 1.5, "m" must be set to a value greater than 9 to ensure that the
   consecutive offset vectors have an absolute difference of less than
   twice the obscuring distance.  This protects against the problem
   described in Section 4.2.

Internet-Draft             Obscuring Location              November 2010


   Setting "m" to 20 ensures that this difference is less than one
   multiple of the obscuring distance (0.93378 times).  This means that
   a substantial change in offset vector occurs after linear movement of
   20 times the obscuring distance in the aggregate.

4.3.6.  The Wonky Grid

   To address the concerns caused by the curvature of the Earth, a
   modified grid-like structure can be used.  It is not strictly
   necessary that the grid be absolutely grid-like in structure.
   Therefore, it's possible that different grid intervals could be
   selected.

   This structure uses a different interval for points at different
   latitudes, at the selected low latitude:

      grid[llat] =  grid / cos(latitude[low])
      longitude[low,llat] =  floor(longitude / grid[llat]) * grid[llat]
      longitude[high,llat] =  longitude[low,llat] + grid[llat]

   ...and at the high latitude:

      grid[hlat] = grid / cos(latitude[high])
      longitude[low,hlat] = floor(longitude / grid[hlat]) * grid[hlat]
      longitude[high,hlat] = longitude[low,hlat] + grid[hlat]

   ...where "cos(x)" produces the cosine of "x".

   This produces fewer grid points for latitudes that are further from
   the Equator.  At the poles (and above), a single offset vector is
   sufficient.

   Interpolation of these points uses four distinct points, as shown in
   Figure 5.

      w1 = uniformDistInterp(r[x1_1,y1], r[x2_1,y1], tx_1)
      tx_2 = (x - x1_2) / (x2_2 - x1_2)
      w2 = uniformDistInterp(r[x1_2,y2], r[x2_2,y2], tx_2)

   Note that this uses the uniformly distributed random values selected
   at each grid point, rather than the offset vectors.  Each random
   value is a uniformly distributed random value in the range [0, 1).

4.3.6.1.  Wonky Grid Points at the Poles

   At 90 degrees North and South, the cosine used to determine the wonky
   grid produces a zero.  This produces an undefined grid spacing.

   To avoid this problem, produce a single value at each pole: (90, 0)
   and (-90, 0).  This value replaces "w1" or "w2" in the interpolation
   equations.  Retaining the same weighting for determining the final
   offset is desirable, so that the rate of change is not artificially
   increased.

4.3.6.2.  Interpolation About the 180th Meridian

   At 180 degrees East (or West), longitude values cross from positive
   to negative values.  This produces a discontinuity in the values
   used.  This could be exploited to learn when the known location cross
   the 180th meridian.

                 Figure 6: Interpolation About 180 Degrees

   This problem might only manifest for one of the two interpolations
   performed across changing longitude values in a wonky grid.  To
   address this, the values produced by the negative and positive
   aspects are independently generated, then these values are
   interpolated over a span of one grid interval.

   For any point within half of one grid interval from the 180th
   meridian, this algorithm is used.  Perform interpolation using the
   selected grid points, then add or subtract 360 degrees from the
   original value to get a value that is either more than 180 degrees or
   less than -180 degrees.  Perform interpolation on this second point.

   The two interpolated values are then interpolated using a different
   proportion.  This interpolation is taken on the overlap interval that
   crosses the 180th meridian, as shown in the Figure 6.  This
   proportion is produced by taking the positive input value (that is,
   the longitude value, with 360 degrees added if it is negative) and
   applying the following:

      grid = m * obscuring distance * 9e-6 / cos(latitude)
      IF longitide + grid / 2 > 180 OR longitude - grid / 2 < -180 THEN:
         t = ((longitude + 360) % 360 - 180 - grid / 2) / grid
         random[o] = uniformDistInterp(random[+ve], random[-ve], t)
      ENDIF

   ...where "%" represents the modulo operation.  The final interpolated
   value is determined using the uniformly distributed weighted average
   method described in Section 4.3.5.1.

4.3.7.  Temporal Interpolation

   Providing different values over time is difficult to balance against
   the need to obscure the same location in the same way.  It is
   possible to add additional dimensions upon which to interpolate the
   offset vector.  Adding time as one such dimension would allow the
   offset vector to change gradually over time as well as with respect

   to space.

   Although a form of temporal interpolation might allow the obscuring
   entity to change the secret key that it maintains, it does not
   provide positional stability unless the interpolation is performed
   over a significant period.  Changing the offset vector applied to the
   same location would negate much of the benefit derived from the
   algorithm.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a method for obscuring location.  An effort
   has been made to ensure that reported locations do not reveal any
   more information than the input dictates.  However, obscuring
   location is not a substitute for withholding location information if
   the goal is to ensure that a recipient remains ignorant of the known
   location.  Alternatively, a recipient might be provided with
   completely falsified location information.

   There is little point in obscuring location when other location-
   related information is included in a composite document, like a
   presence document [RFC3863].  Removing other information, such as
   dynamic location information [RFC5965] is necessary to ensure that
   this cannot be used to recover the known location.

   A reported location can inadvertently reveal far more information
   than intended to a recipient in possession of additional information.

   A recipient might be able to apply this additional information to
   determine the location of the target with less uncertainty than
   desired.  For instance, a recipient with a map might be able to
   identify areas on that map that a target is more likely to be found.
   A recipient can combine any additional information with the knowledge
   that the reported location is correct at the time it is reported to
   recover a better estimate of the known location.  Aside from map-
   based data, other information that could be used to acquire a more
   accurate estimate of the location of a target might include knowledge
   of the target's past behavior, personality traits, or aggregated
   demographic data.  Increasing the obscuring distance might increase
   the uncertainty in the location the recipient ultimately recovers.
   The complexity involved and the large volume of additional data
   involved makes more specific measures difficult.
