1. Introduction

   The Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3), which is defined in RFC
   1939 [RFC1939], is an application-layer protocol used by local e-mail
   clients to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a simple TCP/IP
   connection.  It supports simple download-and-delete requirements for
   access to remote mailboxes (also called a maildrop).

   Initially, POP3 was intended to be used "in the clear".  But since it
   is often employed to transfer sensitive information, there is a need
   to secure POP3 transaction; actually, the only protocol used for this
   purpose is Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (and its
   deprecated predecessor Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) [RFC6101]).  

   Historically, two ways of securing the POP3 connection have been
   deployed (like 2 ways of securing HTTP [RFC2616]; see below).  The
   first includes establishing TLS layer connection during the POP3
   transaction (also known as upgrading to TLS).  It is discussed in
   details in RFC 2595 [RFC2595].  The other one involves establishing
   TLS connection directly before establishing POP3 transaction.  Unlike
   the first one, this way (called "POP3S" throughout this document) has
   never been given an official specification.  (In the case with HTTP
   the first way is specified in RFC 2817 [RFC2817]; the second one - in
   RFC 2818 [RFC2818].)

   This memo is to remove this uncertainty; it specifies the POP3S
   protocol in details.  This document updates RFC 1939 [RFC1939].  RFC

   2595 [RFC2595] is also updated by it (see Section 2.5 for
   justification).  This memo also updates the registration of the TCP
   well-known port 995, used with POP3S.

   RFC 6186 [RFC6186] specifies the way to use DNS SRV records [RFC2782]
   for locating information about email access services.  Among other,
   it defined the way of mentioning that a particular server supports
   POP3S.  For more information, refer to Section 3.3 of RFC 6186.

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
   Terminology from RFC 1939 [RFC1939] is used in this document.

   The "POP3S transaction" refers to the POP3 transaction established as
   described in Section 2.1.

2. POP3 over TLS Protocol

   This section contains the technical definition of POP3 over TLS
   protocol (POP3S).

2.1. Connection Establishment and User Authentication

   This section describes how to establish POP3S transaction.

   First, the client first establishes the TCP connection [RFC0793] to
   the server on the 995 port, or other, if explicitly mentioned.  As
   soon as successful connection is established, the TLS negotiation
   [RFC5246] SHALL be preformed.  RFC nnnn [I-D.melnikov-email-tls-
   certs] describes the procedure which MUST be followed by the clients
   to verify server's certificate.  Upon successful negotiation all data
   SHALL be sent under TLS layer, as defined in Section 2.2. 
   Unsuccessful TLS negotiation SHALL lead to termination of TCP
   connection.

   As soon as successful TLS layer connection is established, the server
   sends the greeting line, as defined by RFC 1939.  Both the server and
   the client MUST enter AUTHORIZATION state then.

   Next, the client should authorize itself to the server.  If there is
   a convention between the parties regarding authorization using X.509
   certificate, the client SHOULD first try to authorize itself using
   SASL EXTERNAL mechanism, which is defined in Appendix A of RFC 4422
   [RFC4422].  For this purpose, the AUTH command [RFC5034] SHALL be
   used.  (Correspondingly, those servers and clients which support

INTERNET DRAFT               POP3 over TLS               August 12, 2011


   authentication using X.509 certificate MUST support SASL EXTERNAl
   mechanism.)

   However, if SASL EXTERNAL authentication fails, or there is no
   convention on using X.509 certificate for authentication, the client
   SHALL use some other way to identify itself, e.g. USER and PASS
   commands.

   Anyway, as soon as the client authenticates itself, and the server
   verifies its credentials, they both enter TRANSACTION state and begin
   exchanging POP commands and replies.

   Please note that per RFC 6176 [RFC6176], neither clients nor servers
   must perform attempts to negotiate use of SSL 2.0.

2.2. Data Exchange

   All the data (explicitly, POP3 commands and responses), upon
   successful TLS negotiation, SHALL be sent as TLS "application data".

2.3. Connection Closure

   TLS provides the possibility for secure connection closure. 
   Therefore, upon POP3S transaction closure, the client SHALL initiate
   the exchange of TLS close alerts, which should happen before TCP
   connection termination.  When the server receives the TLS close
   alert, it may be sure that no other data will be sent in this
   connection.  The POP3 client MAY, after sending TLS close alert,
   terminate its part of connection without waiting a response from the
   server.

2.4. Default Port

   Historically, the separate TCP port has been used for POP3S - 995. 
   Therefore if there is no explicit specification of port, the client
   SHALL connect the server on it.  Section 4 of this document updates
   IANA registration of this port number with reference to this document
   in the corresponding registry.

2.5. Disadvantages of POP3S

   Section 7 of RFC 2595 [RFC2595] contains a few words about the POP3S
   protocol.  It discourages its usage in favor of STLS command,
   described in it, mainly claiming that POP3S, if implemented, would
   cause many misunderstandings regarding the need of new URI scheme,
   separate port numbers, etc.  These issues are fully considered;
   however the usefulness of POP3S certainly overweighs these flaws. 
   This specification updates RFC 2595; however, upon approval of this

   document, it does not ban the usage of STLS command described there -
   it and POP3S may be continued to be used simultaneously.

3. Security Considerations

   The POP3S protocol is primarily aimed to secure POP3 connection. 
   This is achieved by sending data under TLS layer [RFC5246], that
   provides protection from eavesdropping, tampering, or message
   forgery.  Moreover, one of the POP3S scenarios assumes that TLS
   negotiation also serves to authenticate the user agent, which
   increases the security level of such authentication.

   Other authentication schemes, such as Kerberos [RFC4752] (see Section
   2 of this document), are also allowed.  Please refer to Security
   consideration sections of such authentication schemes' specifications
   for discussion of security issues for such certain authentication
   schemes.

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to update the registration of the TCP well-known port
   995 using the following template (see RFC 6335 [RFC6335]):

     Service Name: pop3s

     Transport Protocol: TCP
