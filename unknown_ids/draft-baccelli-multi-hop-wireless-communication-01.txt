Internet-Draft   Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless Communication   February 2009


1.  Introduction

   The goal of this document is to describe some important aspects of
   multi-hop ad hoc wireless communication between routers, observed
   over the years.  Experience gathered with multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   communication [RFC2501] [RFC3626] [RFC3561] [RFC3684] [RFC4728]
   [DoD01] shows that this type of communication presents specific
   challenges.  This document briefly describes some of these
   challenges.

2.  Communication on Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless Networks

   In this document, we consider a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network to
   be a collection of devices that all have radio transceivers using the
   same physical and medium access protocols.  All are configured to
   provide store-and-forward functionality on top of these protocols, as
   needed to enable communications; consequently, they can be classified
   as routers in the resulting wireless network.  In the following, we
   will refer to these devices equivalently as nodes, or routers.

   Let A and B be two nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network N.
   Suppose that, when node A transmits a packet through its interface on
   network N, that packet is detectable by node B without requiring
   storage and/or forwarding by any other router.  In this circumstance,
   we will say that B can receive packets directly from A.
   Alternatively, we may also say that B "hears" packets from A. Note
   that therefore, when B can hear IP packets from A, the TTL of the IP
   packet heard by B will be precisely the same as it was when A
   transmitted that packet.

   Let S be the set of nodes that can hear packets transmitted by node A
   through its interface on network N. We will now describe some
   fundamental characteristics of multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   communication.  Because of these characteristics, some assumptions
   about packet transmission that are typically made in wired networks,
   are often untrue in multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks.

3.  Asymmetry, Time-Variation, and Non-Transitivity

   First, there is no guarantee that a router C within S can,
   symmetrically, send IP packets directly to router A. In other words,
   even though C can "hear" packets from node A (since it is a member of
   set S), there is no guarantee that A can "hear" packets from node C.
   Thus, multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications may be "asymmetric".
   Such asymmetry is often experienced on multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   networks, due to well-known properties of wireless communication.

   Second, there is no guarantee that, as a set, S is at all stable.

Internet-Draft   Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless Communication   February 2009


   The membership of set S may in fact change at any rate, any time.
   Thus, multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications may be "time-variant".
   Such variations are often experienced on multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   networks due to variability of the wireless medium, and to router
   mobility.

   Now, conversely, let V be the set of routers from which node A can
   directly receive packets -- in other words, A can "hear" packets from
   any node in set V. Suppose that router A is communicating at time t0
   through its interface on network N. As a consequence of time
   variation and assymetry, we observe that A:

   1.  cannot assume that S = V,

   2.  cannot assume that S and/or V are unchanged at time t1 later than
       t0.

   Furthermore, transitivity is not guaranteed over multi-hop ad hoc
   wireless networks.  Indeed, let's assume that, through their
   respective interfaces within network N:

   1.  node B and node A can hear each other (i.e. node B is a member of
       sets S and V), and,

   2.  node A and node C can also hear each other (i.e. node C is a also
       a member of sets S and V).

   This neither implies that node B can hear node C, nor that node C can
   hear node B (through their interface on network N).  Such non-
   transitivity is often observed on multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks.

   In a nutshell: multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications often prove
   to be asymmetric, non-transitive, and time-varying in character.

4.  Radio Range, Exposed Nodes and Hidden Terminals

   Wireless communication links are often subject to significant
   limitations to the distance across which they may be established.  In
   the extreme cases, some radio links are measured in centimeters, not
   meters, although such short-range radio links are not typically
   considered to support multi-hop ad hoc networks.  More often, radio
   links are encountered with range limited to several tens or hundreds
   of meters.

   The range-limited characteristic of wireless communications creates
   new problems that are often observed in multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   networks.  One such problem is shown in Figure 1.  Observe that, even
   though the nodes are shown as all having equal communication ranges,

   they are not at all equally accessible to each other.  In the figure,
   two wireless communications are shown to be in progress; one from
   node D to node C, and the other one from node A to node B. As shown,
   this figure illustrates that while router D can hear router C without
   interference, router C is prevented from hearing router D because
   router A (in C's radio range), is already communicating with another
   node.  This case is known as the "exposed node" problem, and is often
   observed on multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks.


                    Radio Ranges for Routers A, B, C, D

   <~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~> <~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~>
                |<~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~>|<~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~>
             +--|-+        +--|-+        +--|-+        +--|-+
             |RtrD|=======>|RtrC|        |RtrA|------->|RtrB|
             +----+        +----+        +----+        +----+

                    Router C becomes an Exposed Node


        Figure 1: The exposed node problem. Router C is prevented
                  from hearing router D while router A is
                  communicating with router B.


   Another case which is caused by the range-limited characteristic of
   wireless communications and is often observed in multi-hop ad hoc
   wireless networks, is shown in Figure 2.  In this example routers B
   and C cannot hear each other.  On the other hand, routers A and B can
   hear each other and furthermore A and C can also hear each other.
   When routers B and C try to communicate with router A at the same
   time, their radio signals collide.  Router A will only be able to
   detect noisy interference, and may even be unable to determine the
   source of the issue.  This case is known as the "hidden terminal"
   problem, and is often observed on multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks.

                try to communicate with router A at the same time,

5.  Alternative Terminology

   Many terms have been used in the past to describe the relationship of
   nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network based on their ability
   to send or receive packets to/from each other.  The terms used in
   this document have been selected because the authors believe (or at
   least hope) they are relatively unambiguous, with respect to the goal
   of this document (see Section 1).

   Nevertheless, here are a few other phrasings, describing the same
   relationship between wireless nodes.  In the following, let network N
   be, again, a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network.  Let the set S be, as
   before, the set of routers that can directly receive packets
   transmitted by router A through its interface on network N. In other
   words, any router B belonging to S can "hear" packets transmitted by
   router A. Then, due to the asymmetry characteristic of wireless
   links:

      - We may say that router B is reachable from router A. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that router A is reachable from
      node B, even if router B is reachable from router A.

      - We may say that router A has a link to router B. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that router B has a link to
      router A, even if router A has a link to router B.

      - We may say that router B is adjacent to router A. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that router A is adjacent to
      router B, even if router B is adjacent to router A.

      - We may say that router B is a neighbor of router A. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that router A is a neighbor of
      router B, even if router B a neighbor of router A.

      - We may say that router B is downstream from router A. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that router A is downstream
      from router B, even if router B is downstream from router A.

   This list of alternative terminologies is given here for illustrative
   purposes only, and is not suggested to be complete or even
   representative of the breadth of terminologies that have been used in
   various ways to explain the properties mentioned in Section 2.
