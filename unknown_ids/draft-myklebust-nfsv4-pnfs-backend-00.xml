		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>
				The object of this proposal is to allow further
				scale out of NFS traffic by allowing NFS clients
				to share the contents of their file data caches
				with other NFS clients.
			</t>
			<t>
				The model assumes a server workload in which a number of
				read-only files are commonly accessed by more than
				one client at a time. A typical use case would be
				one in which the exported filesystem contains a set
				of libraries. e.g. a UNIX /lib partition, a set
				of CAD/CAM objects, or a collection of php modules
				and other static webserver data.
				On such systems, a common problem occurs when booting
				up the cluster when possibly all clients need to access
				the same library data at roughly the same time. The
				server bandwidth gets eaten up through serving up the
				same data over and over again.
			</t>
			<t>
				It is not obvious that use of the pNFS scale out mode is
				sufficient to avoid this kind of congestion. The
				fundamental problem is that NFS clients are all accessing
				the same data, which are striped over the same data servers.
				The effect may therefore simply be to move the bottleneck
				from the metadata server over onto the data servers.
			</t>
			<t>
				Current methods of reducing the impact of this congestion
				typically require the user to dedicate extra resources for
				the boot process. They include preloading the data on the
				client in local permanent caches (a.k.a. cachefs),
				replication of the shared data across several NFS servers
				and setting up NFS proxy servers.
			</t>
			<t>
				Another solution, which does not require the use of
				dedicated resources is the peer-to-peer model
				in which the first few clients to read the data from
				the server are allowed to share the contents of their
				cache with the next waves. This RFC attempts to enable
				such a model by allowing clients which have already
				cached data to act as pNFS data servers toward their
				peers. It does so by defining a control protocol
				in the sense defined in Section 12.2.6 of
				<xref target="draft-ietf-nfsv4-minorversion1-29"/>
				to enable the data server to enforce layouts, and
				negotiate authentication and authorization
				information with the server.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Description of the proposed data sharing model">
			<section title="NFS client acting as a pure pNFS client">
				<t>
					The proposal implies no protocol changes for NFSv4.1
					clients that wish only to act as pNFS clients, in
					order to access the cached data from other clients.
					These clients will request file layouts from the meta
					data server using the LAYOUTGET operation in the
					usual fashion. Should the server return
					NFS4ERR_LAYOUTUNAVAILABLE, then the client proceeds
					to read from the file through the metadata server
					in the usual manner. Otherwise, the client interprets
					the returned file layout in the manner specified by
					Section 13 of
					<xref target="draft-ietf-nfsv4-minorversion1-29"/>
					(NFSv4.1 as a Storage Protocol in pNFS: the File Layout
					Type).
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Meta data server responsibilities">
				<t>
					The metadata server has the usual responsibilities
					as dictated by Section 13 of
					<xref target="draft-ietf-nfsv4-minorversion1-29"/>.
					It maintains the list of available data servers for
					each file, and manages the layout requests from
					pNFS clients, responds to PROXY_OPEN requests from
					data servers, and ensures that PROXY_OPEN stateids
					are revoked when the corresponding layout is
					revoked.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="NFS client acting as a pNFS data server">
				<t>
					A client that wishes to act as a data server is required
					to notify the metadata server of that intention using the
					REGISTER_DS operation. Depending on the circumstances,
					the client may opt to register as a data server for all
					cached files, for just a single filesystem, for a collection
					of filesystems, for a collection of specific files, or for
					just a single file.
				</t>
				<t>
					As stated in the introduction, the design assumes that the
					sharing of cached data between NFS clients will reduce the
					amount of NFS traffic to the permanent storage medium.
					It therefore only makes sense to invoke this model in the
					case when the server knows that the client that is acting
					as a data server is caching the file data aggressively.
					In order to verify that this is the case, we require
					that the metadata server can only issue layouts for
					data servers that hold a read delegation for the file
					in question.
				</t>
				<t>
					Conversely, a client that is registered to act as a data
					server, and that receives a READ request for a file for
					which it does not hold a delegation, MUST reject that
					request with the error NFS4ERR_PNFS_NO_LAYOUT.
				</t>
				<t>
					When the data server receives a READ request from a client
					with a stateid or a data server filehandle that it does not
					recognise, it attempts to validate that request using the
					PROXY_OPEN call. This operation will convert the data server
					filehandle as provided by the layout into a real filehandle,
					that the data server can use to access the file on the
					metadata server. In order to make it easy for the data
					server to identify the file, the real filehandle SHOULD match
					the filehandle that was returned to the client when it
					received the read delegation.
				</t>
				<t>
					The PROXY_OPEN call also checks the access rights that were
					granted by the layout and the READ stateid for validity. If
					the pNFS client in question does not hold a layout for this
					file, the PROXY_OPEN request from the data server will return
					NFS4ERR_PNFS_NO_LAYOUT. In this case, the data server should
					not attempt to service the READ request, but should pass the
					error on to the pNFS client.
				</t>
				<t>
					If file access was verified by PROXY_OPEN, the data server
					can then attempt to service the READ request from its cache.
					Should it fail to find the data in its cache, the data server
					should attempt to retrieve it from the parent server.
				</t>
				<t>
					When layouts are returned to the metadata server, the data
					server is made responsible for fencing off any further READ
					requests. To do so, the metadata server sends a
					CB_PROXY_REVOKE callback to the data server (or servers) that
					are referenced by that layout.
					Upon receiving the CB_PROXY_REVOKE callback, the data server
					should match the filehandle and stateid arguments to the data
					filehandle that was previously used as an argument to the
					PROXY_OPEN request, and the stateid that was returned by
					that request. Should the client attempt to reuse the same
					data filehandle and stateid in a future READ request, then
					the data server SHOULD revalidate the client's access using
					another PROXY_OPEN rpc call to the metadata server.
				</t>
				<t>
					An NFS client can at all times revoke its offer to act
					as a data server by using the UNREGISTER_DS operation.
					This operation takes a single stateid, as returned by the
					original REGISTER_DS request. When the metadata server
					receives such a request, it must immediately revoke all
					layouts that reference that particular data server. It
					does not need to send a CB_PROXY_REVOKE notification to
					the data server that it unregistering, however it MUST
					any other data servers that are referenced by the same
					layout.
				</t>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section title="Security considerations">
			<t>
				As per Section 13.1 in
				<xref target="draft-ietf-nfsv4-minorversion1-29"/>, it is
				expected that metadata servers will need to encode server
				routing information in the data server filehandles. To enable
				this, the REGISTER_DS request includes a 64-bit cookie argument
				that the metadata server is required to store. It is then
				required to encode that 64-bit cookie in the first 64-bits of
				the data server filehandle.
			</t>
			<t>
				All operations from the data server to the metadata
				server, including any operations required to refill
				the file cache in order to satisfy a READ request by
				the pNFS client should be authenticated using a
				principal of the form "nfsd/hostname@REALM". It is,
				however expected that this requirement will be obsoleted,
				should the proposal for RPCSEC_GSSv3
				<xref target="draft-williams-rpcsecgssv3"/> be approved. In
				this case, the data server may instead choose to create a
				process credential that asserts the credentials of the pNFS
				client.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="State expiration and recovery considerations">
			<t>
				Should the pNFS client's session expire on the metadata
				server, then the latter is required to recall all layouts
				from the data servers using the CB_PROXY_REVOKE callback.
				Upon re-establishing the session, the pNFS client then
				proceeds to follow the usual state recovery routine,
				including layout recovery.
			</t>
			<t>
				Should the pNFS client's session expire on the data
				server then it is required to recover that session
				before it can issue a new READ request. In that case,
				the data server MUST assume that all existing layouts
				have been revoked. Should the pNFS client attempt
				to assert a layout then it MUST be validated using
				a PROXY_OPEN call.
			</t>
			<t>
				Should the data server's session expire on the metadata
				server, then the metadata server MUST revoke all layouts
				that reference that data server. It should also consider
				as invalid any REGISTER_DS requests that the data server
				had issued. After recovering its session, the data server
				MAY reissue the REGISTER_DS requests.
			</t>
			<t>
				Finally, if the metadata server crashes, then the data server
				SHOULD assert all REGISTER_DS requests as part of the
				recovery process. Once that is done, it must also assume
				that all layouts have been revoked, and that any attempt
				to reuse them MUST be revalidated using a PROXY_OPEN
				request.
				Otherwise, both it and the pNFS client perform the normal
				NFS client recovery process.

					<t>
						The REGISTER_DS operation allows an NFS client to
						signal to the metadata server its ability to act
						as a data server towards other NFS clients.
						Note that the MDS MUST not ever issue a layout
						for a file for which the client does not hold
						a read delegation.
					</t>
					<t>
						The client can register an intention to export
						all files for which it holds a read delegation,
						using the argument REGISTER_DS_ALL.
					</t>
					<t>
						It is also anticipated that some NFS setups may
						have the ability to set a caching and/or re-exporting
						policy. For such setups, it is possible to set more
						fine-grained data server policies:
						<list> <t>
								REGISTER_DS_FILESYSTEM allows the client to specify
								that it wants to be a data server for a specific
								filesystem only.
								</t> <t>
								REGISTER_DS_ADD_FILESYSTEM allows the client to
								specify that it wants to add a filesystem to
								the data server represented by the stateid
								'rea_dataserver_stateid'.
								</t> <t>
								REGISTER_DS_FILE allows the client to specify
								that it wants to serve a particular file only.
								</t> <t>
								REGISTER_DS_ADD_FILE allows the client to
								specify that it wants to add a file to the
								data server represented by the stateid
								'rea_dataserver_stateid'.
							</t>
						</list>
					</t>
					<t>
						The client should also supply a unique 64-bit identifier in the
						argument rea_mds_identifier. This identifier should be put as
						the first 8 bytes of any data server filehandle, and may be
						used by the data server to identify the MDS to which the
						filehandle belongs.
					</t>
					<t>
						On success, the server returns the stateid 'res_dataserver_stateid'
						which acts to identify the data server in future REGISTER_DS
						calls, and in UNREGISTER_DS calls.
					</t>
					<t>
						The client may in fact hold several data server
						stateids, and use them to manage the overall
						policy.
