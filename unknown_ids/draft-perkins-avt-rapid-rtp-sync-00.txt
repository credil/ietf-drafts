Abstract

   This memo outlines how RTP multimedia sessions are synchronised, and
   discusses how rapidly such synchronisation can occur.  It is shown
   that unicast sessions can be synchronised immediately in most cases.
   Multicast groups have longer synchronisation delay.  A modification
   to the RTCP timing rules is suggested to improve synchronisation time
   for SSM senders.  A new RTP/AVPF feedback packet is defined to
   improve general synchronisation times.

Internet-Draft             RTP Synchronisation              October 2008


1.  Introduction

   When using RTP to deliver multimedia content it's often necessary to
   synchronise playout of audio and video components of a presentation.
   This is achieved using information contained in RTP Control Protocol
   (RTCP) Sender Report (SR) packets [1].  These are sent periodically
   and the components of a multimedia session cannot be synchronised
   until an RTCP SR packet has been received for each flow.  Recently,
   concern has been expressed that this initial synchronisation delay is
   problematic for some applications, for example those using layered or
   multiple description video coding.  This memo reviews the operation
   of RTP synchronisation, describes the initial synchronisation delay
   that can be expected, and defines an enhancement to the Extended RTP
   Profile for RTCP-based Feedback (RTP/AVPF) [2] to provide faster
   synchronisation in some circumstances.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].


2.  Synchronisation of RTP Flows

   RTP flows are synchronised by receivers based on information that is
   contained in RTCP SR packets generated by senders (specifically, the
   NTP and RTP timestamps).  Each media type is sent in a separate RTP
   session, and the receiver associates RTP flows to be synchronised by
   means of the canonical end-point identifier (CNAME) item included in
   the RTCP Source Description (SDES) packets generated by the sender.
   To ensure synchronisation, an RTP sender MUST therefore send periodic
   compound RTCP packets following Section 6 of RFC 3550 [1].

   The timing of these periodic compound RTCP packets will depend on the
   number of members in each RTP session, the fraction of those that are
   sending data, the session bandwidth, the configured RTCP bandwidth
   fraction, and whether the session is multicast or unicast (see RFC
   3550 Section 6.2 for details).  In summary, RTCP control traffic is
   allocated a small fraction, generally 5%, of the session bandwidth.
   Of that RTCP bandwidth fraction, one quarter is allocated to active
   RTP senders, while receivers use the remaining three quarters (these
   fractions can be configured via SDP [4]).  Each member of an RTP
   session derives an RTCP reporting interval based on these fractions,
   whether the session is multicast or unicast, the number of members it
   has observed, and whether it is actively sending data or not.  It
   then sends a compound RTCP packet on average once per reporting
   interval (the actual transmission delay for each packet is randomised
   in the range [0.5 ... 1.5] times the reporting interval to avoid
   synchronisation of reports).

Internet-Draft             RTP Synchronisation              October 2008


   A minimum reporting interval of 5 seconds is RECOMMENDED, except that
   the delay before sending the initial report "MAY be set to half the
   minimum interval to allow quicker notification that the new
   participant is present" [1].  Also, for unicast sessions, "the delay
   before sending the initial compound RTCP packet MAY be zero" [1].  In
   addition, for unicast sessions, and for active senders in a multicast
   session, the fixed minimum reporting interval MAY be scaled to "360
   divided by the session bandwidth in kilobits/second.  This minimum is
   smaller than 5 seconds for bandwidths greater than 72 kb/s." [1]


3.  Initial Synchronisation Delay

   A multimedia session comprises a set of concurrent RTP sessions among
   a common group of participants, using one RTP session for each media
   type.  For example, a videoconference (which is a multimedia session)
   might contain an audio RTP session and a video RTP session.  To allow
   a receiver to synchronise the components of a multimedia session, a
   compound RTCP packet containing an RTCP SR packet and an RTCP SDES
   packet with a CNAME item MUST be sent to each of the RTP sessions in
   the multimedia session.  A receiver cannot synchronise playout across
   the multimedia session until such RTCP packets have been received on
   all of the component RTP sessions.  If there is no packet loss, this
   gives an expected initial synchronisation delay equal to the average
   time taken to receive the first RTCP packet in the RTP session with
   the longest RTCP reporting interval.  This will vary between unicast
   and multicast RTP sessions.

3.1.  Unicast Sessions

   For unicast multimedia sessions, senders SHOULD transmit an initial
   compound RTCP packet (containing an RTCP SR packet and an RTCP SDES
   packet with a CNAME item) immediately on joining each RTP session in
   the multimedia session.  The individual RTP sessions are considered
   to be joined once any in-band signalling for NAT traversal (e.g. [5])
   and/or security keying (e.g. [6],[7]) has concluded, and the media
   path is open.  This implies that the initial RTCP packet is sent in
   parallel with the first data packet following the guidance in RFC
   3550 that "the delay before sending the initial compound RTCP packet
   MAY be zero" and, in the absence of any packet loss, flows can be
   synchronised immediately.

   Note that NAT pinholes, firewall holes, quality-of-service, and media
   security keys should have been negotiated as part of the signalling,
   whether in-band or out-of-band, before the first RTCP packet is sent.
   This should ensure that any middleboxes are ready to accept traffic,
   and reduce the likelihood that the initial RTCP packet will be lost.

3.2.  Source Specific Multicast (SSM) Sessions

   For multicast sessions, the delay before sending the initial RTCP
   packet, and hence the synchronisation delay, varies with the session
   bandwidth and the number of members in the session.  For a multicast
   multimedia session, the average synchronisation delay will depend on
   the slowest of the component RTP sessions; this will generally be the
   session with the lowest bandwidth (assuming all the RTP sessions have
   the same number of members).

   When sending to a multicast group, the reduced minimum RTCP reporting
   interval of 360 seconds divided by the session bandwidth in kilobits
   per second [1] should be used when synchronisation latency is likely
   to be an issue.  Also, as usual, the reporting interval is halved for
   the first RTCP packet.  Depending on the session bandwidth and the
   number of members, this gives the following average synchronisation
   delays:


        Session| Number of receivers (single sender assumed):
      Bandwidth|  2     3     4     5     10   100   1000  10000

   Figure 1: Average RTCP Reporting Interval (seconds)

   These numbers assume a single-source multicast channal with a single
   active sender, which the rules in RFC 3550 section 6.3 give a fixed
   fraction of the RTCP bandwidth irrespective of the number of
   receivers.  It can be seen that they are sufficient for lip-
   synchronisation without excessive delay, but might be viewed as
   having too much latency for synchronising parts of a layered video
   stream.

   The RTCP interval is randomised in the usual manner, so the minimum
   synchronisation delay will be half these intervals, and the maximum
   delay will be 1.5 times these intervals.  Note also that these RTCP
   intervals are calculated assuming perfect knowledge of the number of
   members in the session.  In practice, an implementation will have

   only limited knowledge of the size of the session when joining, and
   will likely send its initial report early compared to these values,
   following the RTCP reconsideration rules.

3.3.  Any Source Multicast (ASM) Sessions

   (tbd)

   For ASM sessions, the fraction of members that are senders plays an
   important role, and imply more varation in average RTCP reporting
   interval.


4.  Discussion

   For unicast sessions, the existing RTCP SR-based mechanism allows for
   immediate synchronisation, provided the initial RTCP packet is not
   lost.

   For SSM sessions, the initial synchronisation delay is sufficient for
   lip-synchronisation, but may be larger than desired for some layered
   codecs.  The rationale for not sending immediate RTCP packets for
   multicast groups is to avoid implosion of requests when large numbers
   of members simultaneously join the group ("flash crowd").  This is
   not an issue for SSM senders, since there can be at most one sender,
   so it might be desirable to allow SSM senders to send an immediate
   RTCP SR on joining a session (as is currenly allowed for unicast
   sessions, which also don't suffer from the implosion problem).  SSM
   receivers using unicast feedback would not be allowed to send
   immediate RTCP.  This would be a change to RFC 3550, if accepted.

   For ASM session... (tbd)

   In all cases, it is possible that the initial RTCP SR packet is lost.
   In this case, the receiver will not be able to synchronise the media
   until the reporting interval has passed, and the next RTCP SR packet
   is sent.  This is undesirable.  The following section defines a new
   RTP/AVPF transport layer feedback message to request an RTCP SR be
   generated, allowing rapid resynchronisation.


5.  Rapid Resynchronisation

   The general format of an RTP/AVPF transport layer feedback message is
   shown below.

   A new feedback message type, RTCP-SR-REQ, is defined with FMT = XXX.
   (the next available FMT is 5?)  This MAY be sent to indicate that a
   receiver is unable to synchronise media streams, and desires that the
   media source send an RTCP SR packet as soon as possible (within the
   constraints of RTCP the early feedback rules).  On receipt of this,
   the media source SHOULD generate an RTCP SR packet as soon as
   possible within the RTCP early feedback rules.  That RTCP SR packet
   MAY be sent as a non-compound RTCP packet, if this has been
   negotiated.

   The Feedback Control Information (FCI) part of the packet is emtpy.
   The SSRC of packet sender indicates the member that is unable to
   synchronise media streams, while the SSRC of media source indicates
   the sender of the media it is unable to synchronise.  The lenght MUST
   equal 2.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the RTP specification [1] and RTP/AVPF
   profile [2] apply.  No addtional security considerations apply due to
   the RTP/AVPF rapid resynchronisation mechanism defined in Section 5.


7.  IANA Considerations

   (tbd - this needs to register the new RTP/AVPF transport layer
   feedback packet type)
