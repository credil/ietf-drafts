Abstract

   This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates for
   the purposes of supporting validation of assertions of "right-to-use"
   of an Internet Number Resource (IP Addresses and Autonomous System
   Numbers).  This profile is used to convey the issuer's authorization
   of the subject to be regarded as the current holder of a "right-of-
   use" of the IP addresses and AS numbers that are described in the
   issued certificate.

Internet-Draft        Resource Certificate Profile             July 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates for
   use in the context of certification of IP Addresses and AS Numbers.
   Such certificates are termed here "Resource Certificates."  Resource
   Certificates are X.509 certificates that conform to the PKIX profile
   [RFC3280], and also conform to the constraints specified in this
   profile.  Resource Certificates attest that the issuer has granted
   the subject a "right-to-use" for a listed set of IP addresses and
   Autonomous System numbers.

   A Resource Certificate describes an action by a certificate issuer
   that binds a list of IP Address blocks and AS Numbers to the subject
   of the issued certificate.  The binding is identified by the
   association of the subject's private key with the subject's public
   key contained in the Resource Certificate, as signed by the private
   key of the certificate's issuer.

   In the context of the public Internet, and the use of public number
   resources within this context, it is intended that Resource
   Certificates are used in a manner that is explicitly aligned to the
   public number resource distribution function.  Specifically, when a
   number resource is allocated or assigned by a number registry to an
   entity, this allocation is described by an associated Resource
   Certificate.  This certificate is issued by the number registry, and
   the subject's public key that is being certified by the issuer
   corresponds to the public key part of a public / private key pair
   that was generated by the same entity who is the recipient of the
   number assignment or allocation.  A critical extension to the
   certificate enumerates the IP Resources that were allocated or
   assigned by the issuer to the entity.  In the context of the public
   number distribution function, this corresponds to a hierarchical PKI
   structure, where Resource Certificates are only issued in one
   'direction' and there is a single unique path of certificates from a
   certificate authority operating at the apex of a resource
   distribution hierarchy to a valid certificate.

   Validation of a Resource Certificate in such a hierarchical PKI can
   be undertaken by establishing a valid issuer-subject certificate
   chain from a certificate issued by a trust anchor certificate
   authority to the certificate [RFC4158], with the additional
   constraint of ensuring that each subject's listed resources are fully
   encompassed by those of the issuer at each step in the issuer-subject
   certificate chain.

   Resource Certificates may be used in the context of the operation of
   secure inter-domain routing protocols to convey a right-to-use of an
   IP number resource that is being passed within the routing protocol,

   allowing relying parties to verify legitimacy and correctness of
   routing information.  Related use contexts include validation of
   Internet Routing Registry objects, validation of routing requests,
   and detection of potential unauthorised use of IP addresses.

   This profile defines those fields that are used in a Resource
   Certificate that MUST be present for the certificate to be valid.
   Relying Parties SHOULD check that a Resource Certificate conforms to
   this profile as a requisite for validation of a Resource Certificate.

1.1.  Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC3280], "X.509
   Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers" [RFC3779], "Internet
   Protocol" [RFC0791], "Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing
   Architecture" [RFC4291], "Internet Registry IP Allocation Guidelines"
   [RFC2050], and related regional Internet registry address management
   policy documents.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  Describing Resources in Certificates

   The framework for describing an association between the subject of a
   certificate and the resources currently under the subject's control
   is described in [RFC3779].

   There are three aspects of this resource extension that are noted in
   this profile:

   1.  RFC 3779 notes that a resource extension SHOULD be a CRITICAL
       extension to the X.509 Certificate.  This Resource Certificate
       profile further specifies that the use of this certificate
       extension MUST be used in all Resource Certificates and MUST be
       marked as CRITICAL.

   2.  RFC 3779 defines a sorted canonical form of describing a resource
       set, with maximal spanning ranges and maximal spanning prefix
       masks as appropriate.  All valid certificates in this profile
       MUST use this sorted canonical form of resource description in
       the resource extension field.

Internet-Draft        Resource Certificate Profile             July 2007


   3.  A test of the resource extension in the context of certificate
       validity includes the condition that the resources described in
       the immediate superior certificate in the PKI hierarchy (the
       certificate where this certificate's issuer is the subject) has a
       resource set (called here the "issuer's resource set") that must
       encompass the resource set of the issued certificate.  In this
       context "encompass" allows for the issuer's resource set to be
       the same as, or a strict superset of, any subject's resource set.

   A test of certificate validity entails the identification of a
   sequence of valid certificates in an issuer-subject chain (where the
   subject field of one certificate appears as the issuer in the next
   certificate in the sequence) from a trust anchor certificate
   authority to the certificate being validated, and that the resource
   extensions in this certificate sequence from the trust anchor's
   issued certificate to the certificate being validated form a sequence
   of encompassing relationships in terms of the resources described in
   the resource extension.


3.  Resource Certificate Fields

   A Resource Certificate is a valid X.509 v3 public key certificate,
   consistent with the PKIX profile [RFC3280], containing the fields
   listed in this section.  Unless specifically noted as being OPTIONAL,
   all the fields listed here MUST be present, and any other field MUST
   NOT appear in a conforming Resource Certificate.  Where a field value
   is specified here this value MUST be used in conforming Resource
   Certificates.

3.1.  Version

   Resource Certificates are X.509 Version 3 certificates.  This field
   MUST be present, and the Version MUST be 3 (i.e. the value of this
   field is 2).

3.2.  Serial number

   The serial number value is a positive integer that is unique per
   Issuer.

3.3.  Signature Algorithm

   This field describes the algorithm used to compute the signature on
   this certificate.  This profile specifies a minimum of SHA-256 with
   RSA (sha256WithRSAEncryption), and allows for the use of SHA-384 or
   SHA-512.  Accordingly, the value for this field MUST be one of the
   OID values { pkcs-1 11 }, { pkcs-1 12 } or { pkcs-1 13 } [RFC4055].



Huston, et al.          Expires January 29, 2008                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Resource Certificate Profile             July 2007


   It is noted that larger key sizes are computationally expensive for
   both the CA and relying parties, indicating that care should be taken
   when deciding to use larger than the minimum key size.

3.4.  Issuer

   This field identifies the entity that has signed and issued the
   certificate.  The value of this field is a valid X.501 name.

   If the certificate is a subordinate certificate issued by virtue of
   the "cA" bit set in the immediate superior certificate, then the
   issuer name MUST correspond to the subject name as contained in the
   immediate superior certificate.

   This field MUST be non-empty.

3.5.  Subject

   This field identifies the entity to whom the resource has been
   allocated / assigned.  The value of this field is a valid X.501 name.

   In this profile the subject name is determined by the issuer, and
   each distinct entity certified by the issuer MUST be identified using
   a subject name that is unique per issuer.

   This field MUST be non-empty.

3.6.  Valid From

   The starting time at which point the certificate is valid.  In this
   profile the "Valid From" time SHOULD be no earlier than the time of
   certificate generation.  As per Section 4.1.2.5 of [RFC3280],
   Certificate Authorities (CAs) conforming to this profile MUST always
   encode the certificate's "Valid From" date through the year 2049 as
   UTCTime, and dates in 2050 or later MUST be encoded as
   GeneralizedTime.  These two time formats are defined in [RFC3280].

   In this profile, it is valid for a certificate to have a value for
   this field that pre-dates the same field value in any superior
   certificate.  However, it is not valid to infer from this information
   that a certificate was, or will be, valid at any particular time
   other than the current time.

3.7.  Valid To

   The Valid To time is the date and time at which point in time the
   certificate's validity ends.  It represents the anticipated lifetime
   of the resource allocation / assignment arrangement between the

Internet-Draft        Resource Certificate Profile             July 2007


   issuer and the subject.  As per Section 4.1.2.5 of [RFC3280], CAs
   conforming to this profile MUST always encode the certificate's
   "Valid To" date through the year 2049 as UTCTime, and dates in 2050
   or later MUST be encoded as GeneralizedTime.  These two time formats
   are defined in [RFC3280].

   In this profile, it is valid for a certificate to have a value for
   this field that post-dates the same field value in any superior
   certificate.  However, it is not valid to infer from this information
   that a certificate was, or will be, valid at any particular time
   other than the current time.

   Certificate Authorities typically are advised against issuing a
   certificate with a validity interval that exceeds the validity
   interval of the CA certificate that will be used to validate the
   issued certificate.  However, in the context of this profile, it is
   anticipated that a CA may have valid grounds to issue a certificate
   with a validity interval that exceeds the validity interval of the
   CA's certificate.

3.8.  Subject Public Key Info

   This field specifies the subject's public key and the algorithm with
   which the key is used.  The public key algorithm MUST be RSA, and,
   accordingly, the OID for the public key algorithm is
   1.2.840.113549.1.1.1.  The key size MUST be a minimum size of 1024
   bits.  In the context of certifying resources it is recommended that
   the key size of keys that are intended to be used at the apex of a
   certificate issuance hierarchy, and their immediate subordinates,
   SHOULD use a minimum key size of 2048 bits.  Immediate subordinates
   of these certificates, when used in the context of continued levels
   of high trust, SHOULD use a minimum key size of 2048 bits.

   In the application of this profile to certification of public number
   resources, it would be consistent with this recommendation that the
   Regional Internet Registries use a key size of 2048 bits in their
   issued certificates, and that their immediate subordinate certificate
   authorities also use a key size of 2048 bits.  All other subordinate
   certificates MAY use a key size of 1024 bits.

   It is noted that larger key sizes are computationally expensive for
   both the CA and relying parties, indicating that care should be taken
   when deciding to use larger than the minimum key size.

3.9.  Resource Certificate Version 3 Extension Fields

   As noted in Section 4.2 of [RFC3280], each extension in a certificate
   is designated as either critical or non-critical.  A certificate-

Internet-Draft        Resource Certificate Profile             July 2007


   using system MUST reject the certificate if it encounters a critical
   extension it does not recognise; however, a non-critical extension
   MAY be ignored if it is not recognised [RFC3280].

   The following X.509 V3 extensions MUST be present in a conforming
   Resource Certificate, except where explicitly noted otherwise.

3.9.1.  Basic Constraints

   The basic constraints extension identifies whether the subject of the
   certificate is a CA and the maximum depth of valid certification
   paths that include this certificate.

   The issuer determines whether the "cA" boolean is set.  If this bit
   is set, then it indicates that the subject is allowed to issue
   resources certificates within this overall framework (i.e. the
   subject is permitted be a CA).

   The Path Length Constraint is not specified in this profile and MUST
   NOT be present.

   The Basic Constraints extension field is a critical extension in the
   Resource Certificate profile, and MUST be present when the subject is
   a CA, and MUST NOT be present otherwise.

3.9.2.  Subject Key Identifier

   The subject key identifier extension provides a means of identifying
   certificates that contain a particular public key.  To facilitate
   certification path construction, this extension MUST appear in all
   Resource Certificates.  This extension is non-critical.

   The value of the subject key identifier MUST be the value placed in
   the key identifier field of the Authority Key Identifier extension of
   immediate subordinate certificates (all certificates issued by the
   subject of this certificate).

   The Key Identifier used here is the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the value
   of the DER-encoded ASN.1 bit string of the subject public key, as
   described in Section 4.2.1.2 of [RFC3280].

3.9.3.  Authority Key Identifier

   The subject key identifier extension provides a means of identifying
   certificates that are signed by the issuer's private key, by
   providing a hash value of the issuer's public key.  To facilitate
   path construction, this extension MUST appear in all Resource
   Certificates.  The keyIdentifier sub field MUST be present in all

   Resource Certificates, with the exception of a CA who issues a "self-
   signed" certificate.  The authorityCertIssuer and
   authorityCertSerialNumber sub fields MUST NOT be present.  This
   extension is non-critical.

   The Key Identifier used here is the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the value
   of the DER-encoded ASN.1 bit string of the issuer's public key, as
   described in Section 4.2.1.1 of [RFC3280].

3.9.4.  Key Usage

   This describes the purpose of the certificate.  This is a critical
   extension, and it MUST be present.

   In certificates issued to CAs only the keyCertSign and CRLSign bits
   are set to TRUE and MUST be the only bits set to TRUE.

   In end-entity certificates the digitialSignature bit MUST be set and
   MUST be the only bit set to TRUE.

3.9.5.  CRL Distribution Points

   This field (CRLDP) identifies the location(s) of the CRL(s)
   associated with certificates issued by this Issuer.  This profile
   uses the URI form of object identification.  The preferred URI access
   mechanism is a single RSYNC URI ("rsync://") [rsync] that references
   a single inclusive CRL for each issuer.

   In this profile the certificate issuer is also the CRL issuer,
   implying at the CRLIssuer sub field MUST be omitted, and the
   distributionPoint sub-field MUST be present.  The Reasons sub-field
   MUST be omitted.

   The distributionPoint MUST contain general names, and MUST NOT
   contain a nameRelativeToCRLIssuer.  The type of the general name MUST
   be of type URI.

   In this profile, the scope of the CRL is specified to be all
   certificates issued by this CA issuer using a given key pair.

   The sequence of distributionPoint values MUST contain only a single
   DistributionPointName set.  The DistributionPointName set MAY contain
   more than one URI value.  An RSYNC URI MUST be present in the
   DistributionPointName set, and reference the most recent instance of
   this issuer's certificate revocation list.  Other access form URIs
   MAY be used in addition to the RSYNC URI.

   This extension MUST be present and it is non-critical.  There is one

   exception; where a CA distributes its public key in the form of a
   "self-signed" certificate, the CRLDP MUST be omitted.

3.9.6.  Authority Information Access

   This field (AIA) identifies the point of publication of the
   certificate that is issued by the issuer's immediate superior CA,
   where this certificate's issuer is the subject.  In this profile a
   single reference object to publication location of the immediate
   superior certificate MUST be used, except in the case where a CA
   distributes its public key in the form of a "self-signed"
   certificate, the authority key identifier SHOULD be omitted.

   This profile uses a URI form of object identification.  The preferred
   URI access mechanisms is "rsync", and an RSYNC URI MUST be specified
   with an accessMethod value of id-ad-caIssuers.  The URI MUST
   reference the point of publication of the certificate where this
   issuer is the subject (the issuer's immediate superior certificate).
   Other access method URIs referencing the same object MAY also be
   included in the value sequence of this extension.

   When an Issuer re-issues a CA certificate, the subordinate
   certificates need to reference this new certificate via the AIA
   field.  In order to avoid the situation where a certificate re-
   issuance necessarily implies a requirement to re-issue all
   subordinate certificates, CA Certificate issuers SHOULD use a
   persistent URL name scheme for issued certificates.  This implies
   that re-issued certificates overwrite previously issued certificates
   to the same subject in the publication repository, and use the same
   publication name as previously issued certificates.  In this way
   subordinate certificates can maintain a constant AIA field value and
   need not be re-issued due solely to a re-issue of the superior
   certificate.  The issuers' policy with respect to the persistence of
   name objects of issued certificates MUST be specified in the Issuer's
   Certificate Practice Statement.

   This extension is non-critical.

3.9.7.  Subject Information Access

   This field (SIA) identifies the location of information and services
   relating to the subject of the certificate in which the SIA extension
   appears.  Where the Subject is a CA in this profile, this information
   and service collection will include all current valid certificates
   that have been issued by this subject that are signed with the
   subject's corresponding private key.

   This profile uses a URI form of location identification.  The

   preferred URI access mechanism is "rsync", and an RSYNC URI MUST be
   specified, with an access method value of id-ad-caRepository when the
   subject of the certificate is a CA.  The RSYNC URI must reference an
   object collection rather than an individual object and MUST use a
   trailing '/' in the URI.

   Other access method URIs that reference the same location MAY also be
   included in the value sequence of this extension.  The ordering of
   URIs in this sequence reflect the subject's relative preferences for
   access methods, with the first method in the sequence being the most
   preferred.

   This field MUST be present when the subject is a CA, and is non-
   critical.

   For End Entity certificates, where the subject is not a CA, this
   field MAY be present, and is non-critical.  If present, it references
   the location where objects signed by the key pair associated with the
   End Entity certificate can be accessed.  The id-ad-
   signedObjectRepository OID is used when the subject is an End Entity
   and it publishes objects signed with the matching private key in a
   repository.

   id-ad OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 48 }

   id-ad-signedObjectRepository OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ad 9 }

3.9.8.  Certificate Policies

   This extension MUST reference the Resource Certificate Policy, using
   the OID Policy Identifier value of "1.3.6.1.5.5.7.14.2".  This field
   MUST be present and MUST contain only this value for Resource
   Certificates.

   PolicyQualifiers MUST NOT be used in this profile.

   This extension MUST be present and it is critical.

3.9.9.  IP Resources

   This field contains the list of IP address resources as per
   [RFC3779].  The value may specify the "inherit" element for a
   particular AFI value.  In the context of resource certificates
   describing public number resources for use in the public Internet,
   the SAFI value MUST NOT be used.  All Resource Certificates MUST
   include an IP Resources extension, an AS Resources extension, or both
   extensions.

   This extension, if present, MUST be marked critical.

3.9.10.  AS Resources

   This field contains the list of AS number resources as per [RFC3779],
   or may specify the "inherit" element.  RDI values are NOT supported
   in this profile and MUST NOT be used.  All Resource Certificates MUST
   include an IP Resources extension, an AS Resources extension, or both
   extensions.

   This extension, if present, MUST be marked critical.


4.  Resource Certificate Revocation List Profile

   Each CA MUST issue a version 2 Certificate Revocation List (CRL),
   consistent with [RFC3280].  The CRL issuer is the CA, and no indirect
   CRLs are supported in this profile.

   An entry MUST NOT be removed from the CRL until it appears on one
   regularly scheduled CRL issued beyond the revoked certificate's
   validity period.

   This profile does not allow issuance of Delta CRLs.

   The scope of the CRL MUST be "all certificates issued by this CA
   using a given key pair".  The contents of the CRL are a list of all
   non-expired certificates issued by the CA using a given key pair that
   have been revoked by the CA.

   The profile allows the issuance of multiple current CRLs with
   different scope by a single CA, with the scope being defined by the
   key pair used by the CA.

   No CRL fields other than those listed here are permitted in CRLs
   issued under this profile.  Unless otherwise indicated, these fields
   MUST be present in the CRL.  Where two or more CRLs issued by a
   single CA with the same scope, the CRL with the highest value of the
   "CRL Number" field supersedes all other CRLs issued by this CA.

4.1.  Version

   Resource Certificate Revocation Lists are Version 2 certificates (the
   integer value of this field is 1).

Internet-Draft        Resource Certificate Profile             July 2007


4.2.  Issuer Name

   The value of this field is the X.501 name of the issuing CA who is
   also the signer of the CRL, and is identical to the Issuer name in
   the Resource Certificates that are issued by this issuer.

4.3.  This Update

   This field contains the date and time that this CRL was issued.  The
   value of this field MUST be encoded as UTCTime for dates through the
   year 2049, and MUST be encoded as GeneralizedTime for dates in the
   year 2050 or later.

4.4.  Next Update

   This is the date and time by which the next CRL SHOULD be issued.
   The value of this field MUST be encoded as UTCTime for dates through
   the year 2049, and MUST be encoded as GeneralizedTime for dates in
   the year 2050 or later.

4.5.  Signature

   This field contains the algorithm used to sign this CRL.  This
   profile specifies a minimum of SHA-256 with RSA
   (sha256WithRSAEncryption), and allows for the use of SHA-384 or SHA-
   512.  This field MUST be present.

   It is noted that larger key sizes are computationally expensive for
   both the CRL Issuer and relying parties, indicating that care should
   be taken when deciding to use larger than the minimum key size.

4.6.  Revoked Certificate List

   When there are no revoked certificates, then the revoked certificate
   list MUST be absent.

   For each revoked resource certificate only the following fields MUST
   be present.  No CRL entry extensions are supported in this profile,
   and CRL entry extensions MUST NOT be present in a CRL.

4.6.1.  Serial Number

   The issuer's serial number of the revoked certificate.

4.6.2.  Revocation Date

   The time the certificate was revoked.  This time SHOULD NOT be a
   future date.  The value of this field MUST be encoded as UTCTime for

   dates through the year 2049, and MUST be encoded as GeneralizedTime
   for dates in the year 2050 or later.

4.7.  CRL Extensions

   The X.509 v2 CRL format allows extensions to be placed in a CRL.  The
   following extensions are supported in this profile, and MUST be
   present in a CRL.

4.7.1.  Authority Key Identifier

   The authority key identifier extension provides a means of
   identifying the public key corresponding to the private key used to
   sign a CRL.  Conforming CRL issuers MUST use the key identifier
   method.  The syntax for this CRL extension is defined in section
   4.2.1.1 of [RFC3280].

   This extension is non-critical.

4.7.2.  CRL Number

   The CRL Number extension conveys a monotonically increasing sequence
   number of positive integers for a given CA and scope.  This extension
   allows users to easily determine when a particular CRL supersedes
   another CRL.  The highest CRL Number value supersedes all other CRLs
   issued by the CA with the same scope.

   This extension is non-critical.


5.  Resource Certificate Request Profile

   A resource certificate request MAY use either of PKCS#10 or
   Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF).  A CA Issuer MUST support
   PKCS#10 and a CA Issuer may, with mutual consent of the subject,
   support CRMF.

5.1.  PCKS#10 Profile

   This profile refines the specification in [RFC2986], as it relates to
   Resource Certificates.  A Certificate Request Message object,
   formatted according to PKCS#10, is passed to a Certificate Authority
   as the initial step in issuing a certificate.

   This request may be conveyed to the CA via a Registration Authority
   (RA), acting under the direction of a Subject.

   With the exception of the public key related fields, the CA is

   permitted to alter any requested field when issuing a corresponding
   certificate.

5.1.1.  PKCS#10 Resource Certificate Request Template Fields

   This profile applies the following additional constraints to fields
   that may appear in a CertificationRequestInfo:

   Version
      This field is mandatory and MUST have the value 0.

   Subject
      This field is optional.  If present, the value of this field
      SHOULD be empty, in which case the issuer MUST generate a subject
      name that is unique in the context of certificates issued by this
      issuer.  If the value of this field is non-empty, then the CA MAY
      consider the value of this field as the subject's suggested
      subject name, but the CA is NOT bound to honour this suggestion,
      as the subject name MUST be unique per issuer in certificates
      issued by this issuer.

   SubjectPublicKeyInfo
      This field specifies the subject's public key and the algorithm
      with which the key is used.  The public key algorithm MUST be RSA,
      and the OID for the algorithm is 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1.  This field
      also includes a bit-string representation of the entity's public
      key.  For the RSA public-key algorithm the bit string contains the
      DER encoding of a value of PKCS #1 type RSAPublicKey.

   Attributes
      [RFC2986] defines the attributes field as key-value pairs where
      the key is an OID and the value's structure depends on the key.

      The only attribute used in this profile is the ExtensionRequest
      attribute as defined in [RFC2985].  This attribute contains X509v3
      Certificate Extensions.  The profile for extensions in certificate
      requests is specified in Section 5.3.

   This profile applies the following additional constraints to fields
   that MAY appear in a CertificationRequest Object:

   signatureAlgorithm
      This profile specifies a minimum of SHA-256 with RSA
      (sha256WithRSAEncryption), and allows for the use of SHA-384 or
      SHA-512.  Accordingly, the value for this field MUST be one of the
      OID values { pkcs-1 11 }, { pkcs-1 12 } or { pkcs-1 13 }
      [RFC4055].

      It is noted that larger key sizes are computationally expensive
      for both the CA and relying parties, indicating that care should
      be taken when deciding to use larger than the minimum key size.

5.2.  CRMF Profile

   This profile refines the Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)
   specification in [RFC4211], as it relates to Resource Certificates.
   A Certificate Request Message object, formatted according to the
   CRMF, is passed to a Certificate Authority as the initial step in
   issuing a certificate.

   This request MAY be conveyed to the CA via a Registration Authority
   (RA), acting under the direction of a subject.

   With the exception of the public key related fields, the CA is
   permitted to alter any requested field when issuing a corresponding
   certificate.

5.2.1.  CRMF Resource Certificate Request Template Fields

   This profile applies the following additional constraints to fields
   that may appear in a Certificate Request Template:

   Version
      This field MAY be absent, or MAY specify the request of a Version
      3 Certificate.  It SHOULD be omitted.

   SerialNumber
      As per [RFC4211], this field is assigned by the CA and MUST be
      omitted in this profile.

   SigningAlgorithm
      As per [RFC4211], this field is assigned by the CA and MUST be
      omitted in this profile.

   Issuer
      This field is assigned by the CA and MUST be omitted in this
      profile.

   Validity
      This field MAY be omitted.  If omitted, the CA will issue a
      Certificate with Validity dates as determined by the CA.  If
      specified, then the CA MAY override the requested values with
      dates as determined by the CA.

   Subject
      This field is optional.  If present, the value of this field
      SHOULD be empty, in which case the issuer MUST generate a subject
      name that is unique in the context of certificates issued by this
      issuer.  If the value of this field is non-empty, then the CA MAY
      consider the value of this field as the subject's suggested
      subject name, but the CA is NOT bound to honour this suggestion,
      as the subject name MUST be unique per issuer in certificates
      issued by this issuer.

   PublicKey
      This field MUST be present.

   extensions
      This attribute contains X509v3 Certificate Extensions.  The
      profile for extensions in certificate requests is specified in
      Section 5.3.

5.2.2.  Resource Certificate Request Control Fields

   The following control fields are supported in this profile:

   Authenticator Control
      It is noted that the intended model of authentication of the
      subject is a long term one, and the advice as offered in [RFC4211]
      is that the Authenticator Control field be used.


5.3.  Certificate Extension Attributes in Certificate Requests

   The following extensions MAY appear in a PKCS#10 or CRMF Certificate
   Request.  Any other extensions MUST NOT appear in a Certificate
   Request.  This profile places the following additional constraints on
   these extensions.:

   BasicConstraints
      If this is omitted then the CA will issue an end entity
      certificate with the BasicConstraints extension not present in the
      issued certificate.

      The Path Length Constraint is not supported in this Resource
      Certificate Profile, and this field MUST be omitted in this
      profile.

      The CA MAY honour the SubjectType CA bit set to on.  If this bit
      is set, then it indicates that the Subject is allowed to issue
      resource certificates within this overall framework.

      The CA MAY honour the SubjectType CA bit set to off (End Entity
      certificate request), in which case the corresponding end entity
      certificate will not contain a BasicConstraints extension.

   SubjectKeyIdentifier
      This field is assigned by the CA and MUST be omitted in this
      profile.

   AuthorityKeyIdentifier
      This field is assigned by the CA and MUST be omitted in this
      profile.

   KeyUsage
      The CA MAY honor KeyUsage extensions of CertificateSigning and
      CRLSigning if present, as long as this is consistent with the
      BasicConstraints SubjectType sub field, when specified.

    SubjectInformationAccess
      This field MAY be present when the subject is a CA, and the field
      value SHOULD be honoured by the CA.  If the CA is not able to
      honor the requested field value, then the CA MUST reject the
      Certificate Request.

      If the field is not present, then the CA shall interpret the
      request as a request by the subject entity to publish subordinate
      certificates via the CA, and the CA will place the publication
      point in the SIA field of the issued certificate.

      This field (SIA) identifies the location of information and
      services relating to the subject of the certificate in which the
      SIA extension appears.  Where the Subject is a CA in this profile,
      this information and service collection will include all current
      valid certificates that have been issued by this subject that are
      signed with the subject's corresponding private key.

      This profile uses a URI form of location identification.  An RSYNC
      URI MUST be specified, with an access method value of id-ad-
      caRepository when the subject of the certificate is a CA.  The
      RSYNC URI MUST reference an object collection rather than an
      individual object and MUST use a trailing '/' in the URI.  Other
      access method URIs that reference the same location MAY also be
      included in the value sequence of this extension.  The ordering of
      URIs in this sequence reflect the subject's relative preferences
      for access methods, with the first method in the sequence being

   With the exceptions of the publicKey field and the
   SubjectInformationAccess field, the CA is permitted to alter any
   requested field.


6.  Resource Certificate Validation

   This section describes the Resource Certificate validation procedure.
   This refines the generic procedure described in section 6 of
   [RFC3280]:

   To meet this goal, the path validation process verifies, among other
   things, that a prospective certification path (a sequence of n
   certificates) satisfies the following conditions:

   1.  for all x in {1, ..., n-1}, the subject of certificate x is the
       issuer of certificate x+1;

   2.  certificate 1 is issued by a trust anchor;

   3.  certificate n is the certificate to be validated; and

   4.  for all x in {1, ..., n}, the certificate is valid.

6.1.  Trust Anchors for Resource Certificates

   The trust model that may be used in the resource certificate
   framework in the context of validation of assertions of public number
   resources in public-use contexts is one that readily maps to a top-
   down delegated CA model that mirrors the delegation of resources from
   a registry distribution point to the entities that are the direct
   recipients of these resources.  Within this trust model these
   recipient entities may, in turn, operate a registry and perform



Huston, et al.          Expires January 29, 2008               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft        Resource Certificate Profile             July 2007


   further allocations or assignments.  This is a strict hierarchy, in
   that any number resource and a corresponding recipient entity has
   only one 'parent' issuing registry for that number resource (i.e.
   there is always a unique parent entity for any resource and
   corresponding entity), and that the issuing registry is not a direct
   or indirect subordinate recipient entity of the recipient entity in
   question (i.e. no loops in the model).

   The more general consideration is that selection of a trust anchor CA
   is a task undertaken by relying parties.  The structure of the
   resource certificate profile admits potentially the same variety of
   trust models as the PKIX profile.  There is only one additional
   caveat on the general applicability of trust models and PKIX
   frameworks, namely that in forming a validation path to a trust
   anchor CA, the sequence of certificates MUST preserve the resource
   extension validation property, as described in Section 6.2, and the
   validation of the first certificate in the validation path not only
   involves the verification that the certificate was issued by a trust
   anchor CA, but also that the resource set described in the
   certificate MUST be encompassed by the trust anchor CA's resource
   set, as described in Section 6.2.

   The trust anchor information, describing a CA that serves as a trust
   anchor, includes the following:
   1.  the trusted issuer name,
   2.  the trusted public key algorithm,
   3.  the trusted public key,
   4.  optionally, the trusted public key parameters associated with the
       public key, and
   5.  a resource set, consisting of a set of IPv4 resources, IPv6
       resources and AS number resources.

   The trust anchor information may be provided to the path processing
   procedure in the form of a self-signed certificate.

6.2.  Resource Extension Validation

   The IP resource extension definition [RFC3779] defines a critical
   extensions for Internet number resources.  These are ASN.1 encoded
   representations of the IPv4 and IPv6 address range (either as a
   prefix/length, or start-end pair) and the AS number set.

   Valid Resource Certificates MUST have a valid IP address and/or AS
   number resource extension.  In order to validate a Resource
   Certificate the resource extension must also be validated.  This
   validation process relies on definitions of comparison of resource
   sets:

Internet-Draft        Resource Certificate Profile             July 2007


   more specific:  Given two IP address or AS number contiguous ranges,
      A and B, A is "more specific" than B if range B includes all IP
      addresses or AS numbers described by range A, and if range B is
      larger than range A.

   equal:  Given two IP address or AS number contiguous ranges, A and B,
      A is "equal" to B if range A describes precisely the same
      collection of IP addresses or AS numbers as described by range B.
      The definition of "inheritance" in [RFC3779] is equivalent to this
      "equality" comparison.
   encompass:  Given two IP address and AS number sets X and Y, X
      "encompasses" Y if, for every contiguous range of IP addresses or
      AS numbers elements in set Y, the range element is either more
      specific than or equal to a contiguous range element within the
      set X.

   Validation of a certificate's resource extension in the context of an
   ordered certificate sequence of {1,2, ... , n} where '1'is issued by
   a trust anchor and 'n' is the target certificate, and where the
   subject of certificate 'x' is the issuer of certificate 'x' + 1,
   implies that the resources described in certificate 'x' "encompass"
   the resources described in certificate 'x' + 1, and the resources
   described in the trust anchor information "encompass" the resources
   described in certificate 1.

6.3.  Resource Certificate Path Validation

   Validation of signed resource data using a target resource
   certificate consists of assembling an ordered sequence (or
   'Certificate Path') of certificates ({1,2,...n} where '1' is a
   certificate that has been issued by a trust anchor, and 'n' is the
   target certificate) verifying that all of the following conditions
   hold:

   1.  The certificate can be verified using the Issuer's public key and
       the signature algorithm

   2.  The current time lies within the certificate's Validity From and
       To values.

   3.  The certificate contains all fields that MUST be present and
       contains field values as specified in this profile for all field
       values that MUST be present.

   4.  No field value that MUST NOT be present in this profile is
       present in the certificate.

Internet-Draft        Resource Certificate Profile             July 2007


   5.  The Issuer has not revoked the certificate by placing the
       certificate's serial number on the Issuer's current Certificate
       Revocation List, and the Certificate Revocation List is itself
       valid.

   6.  That the resource extension data is "encompassed" by the resource
       extension data contained in a valid certificate where this Issuer
       is the Subject (the previous certificate in the ordered sequence)

   7.  The Certificate Path originates with a certificate issued by a
       trust anchor, and there exists a signing chain across the
       Certificate Path where the Subject of Certificate x in the
       Certificate Path matches the Issuer in Certificate x+1 in the
       Certificate Path.

   A certificate validation algorithm may perform these tests in any
   chosen order.

   Certificates and CRLs used in this process may be found in a locally
   maintained cache, maintained by a regular top-down synchronization
   pass, seeded with the CAs who operate at the apex of the resource
   distribution hierarchy, via reference to Issued certificates and
   their SIA fields as forward pointers, plus the CRLDP.  Alternatively,
   validation may be performed using a bottom-up process with on-line
   certificate access using the AIA and CRLDP pointers to guide the
   certificate retrieval process.

   There exists the possibility of encountering certificate paths that
   are arbitrarily long, or attempting to generate paths with loops as
   means of creating a potential DOS attack on a certificate validator.
   Some further heuristics may be required to halt the certificate path
   validation process in order to avoid some of the issues associated
   with attempts to validate such structures.  It is suggested that
   implementations of Resource Certificate validation MAY halt with a
   validation failure if the certificate path length exceeds a pre-
   determined configuration parameter.


7.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of [RFC3280] and [RFC3779]apply to
   Resource Certificates as defined by this profile, and their use.

   A Resource Certificate PKI cannot in and of itself resolve any forms
   of ambiguity relating to uniqueness of assertions of rights of use in
   the event that two or more valid certificates encompass the same
   resource.  If the issuance of resource certificates is aligned to the
   status of resource allocations and assignments then the information

   conveyed in a certificate is no better than the information in the
   allocation and assignment databases.


8.  IANA Considerations
