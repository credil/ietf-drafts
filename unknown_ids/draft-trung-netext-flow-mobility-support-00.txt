Abstract

   To support flow mobility in PMIPv6, the Mobile Node's Home Network
   Prefix should be able to be shared across its attachments and the
   network should support flow-based routing.  This document specifies
   how to extend PMIPv6 to meet these requirements.

Internet-Draft       Flow mobility support in PMIPv6      September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [1] can support multihoming.  The
   Mobile Node (MN) can send simultaneously packets to the PMIPv6 domain
   over multiple interfaces.  However it cannot support flow mobility
   due to the following limitations:

   o  When a flow moves from an interface to a new interface, the HNP
      used by that flow will be assigned to the new interface.  This
      action can discontinue the ongoing sessions on both interfaces.

   o  Since a home network prefix (HNP) can be shared by multiple flows,
      when only some of these flows are moved to a new interface, the
      old interface and the new interface should be able to share the
      same HNP.  That is not supported by the current PMIPv6 standard
      since it supports only Per-MN-Prefix model.

   o  To move a flow to a new interface, the network should be able to
      perform flow-based routing function which is not supported by the
      current PMIPv6 standard.

   To support flow mobility in PMIPv6, we first utilize the advantage of
   the logical interface at the MN to hide the changing at physical
   interfaces from the IP layer and then extend the operations of PMIPv6
   to allow the HNP to be able to be shared across interfaces as well as
   to support flow-based routing functions.


2.  PMIPv6 Extensions

   This section introduces the necessary extensions of the PMIPv6 to
   support flow mobility.

2.1.  Shared-Prefix Model Support

   The first requirement for supporting flow mobility is that the PMIPv6
   should be extended to support shared-prefix model.  Since multiple
   flows can share the same HNP and each flow can be forwarded to
   different attachment, the HNP should be shared across attachments.
   This specification recommends the implementations to extend PMIPv6 in
   two ways, proactive and reactive signaling approach.

2.1.1.  Proactive Signaling

   With the proactive signaling approach, an HNP is shared across
   attachments immediately when it is assigned to the MN.

   When the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) assigns a new HNP to the MN, it

   will immediately signal this HNP to all of the Mobile Access Gateways
   (MAG) that the MN attaches to.  By doing this way, the HNPs assigned
   to the MN are always shared across its attachments in advanced.
   Therefore the LMA can move flows from an attachment to another freely
   and without any extra signaling messages.

           Figure 1: Call flow for proactive signaling approach

   Figure 1 shows signaling call flow the of proactive signaling
   approach.  First, the MN attaches to the MAG1 using the physical
   interface IF1.  The network assigns HNP1 to the IF1.  Next, the MN
   performs new attachment via the physical interface IF2.  The MAG
   sends a Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message with HI=1 to inform the
   LMA.  If the LMA recognizes that the MN can support flow mobility, it
   will assign both new HNP2 and the old HNP1 to the new attachment.
   Upon accepting this PBU message, the LMA sends a Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement (PBA) message including both of the HNP1 and the HNP2
   to the MAG2.  It also signals MAG1 to update with the new HNP2 by
   sending an Home Network Prefix Update Request (HUR) to the MAG1.  On
   receiving the HUR message, the MAG1 setups tunnel and routing path
   for the HNP2 and sends back an Home Network Prefix Update
   Acknowledgement Message (HUA) to inform the LMA that it is ready for
   forwarding the packets of the HNP2.

   After the above steps, both of the MAG1 and the MAG2 can forward the
   packets of the HNP1 as well as the HNP2.  Therefore the LMA can move
   flows between two attachments freely without any extra signaling
   messages.  For example the LMA can move the flow 1, which uses the
   HNP1, from the MAG1 to the MAG2 immediately because the MAG2 is
   already enabled for forwarding the packets of the HNP1.

   With this approach, the implementations need to do two extensions:

   o  Extend the PBA message to include both new HNPs assigned to the
      new attachment and the old HNPs assigned to the current MN's
      attachments.

   o  Extend the MAG and the LMA to enable them to exchange the HUR and
      the HUA message.

2.1.2.  Re-active Signaling

   With the re-active signaling approach, an HNP is shared only when a
   flow using that HNP is moved to an attachment that the HNP is not
   valid.

   When the LMA decides to move a flow and realizes that the HNP used by
   the flow is not valid on the destination MAG, it will signal the HNP
   to that MAG.  By doing this way, an HNP will be shared only when the
   flow using this HNP is moved to an attachment that the HNP is not
   valid currently.

   Figure 2 shows the signaling call flow of re-active signaling
   approach.  First, the MN attaches to the network using 2 interfaces,
   IF1 and IF2.  The network assigns HNP1 to the IF1 and HNP2 to the
   IF2.  The flow 1 is forwarded by the MAG1 and uses HNP1.  When the
   LMA decides to move flow 1 to the MAG2, it sends a HUR message
   including the HNP1 to the MAG2.  On receiving the HUR message, the
   MAG2 setups routing path for the HNP1 and sends back a HUA message to
   inform the LMA that it is ready for forwarding the packets of HNP1.
   After receiving HUA from the MAG2, the LMA can update flow binding
   table to move the flow 1 from MAG1 to MAG2.

   The key different between proactive and reactive approach is that in
   the case of the re-active approach, the HNPs assigned to the MN is
   not shared across attachments in advanced.  Each attachment will be
   assigned a unique HNP(s) as described in the standard RFC5213.  In
   this example, the HNP1 is shared on the MAG2 only when the flow1,
   which uses HNP1, is moved to the MAG2.

   With this approach, the implementations need only to extend the MAG
   and LMA to enable them to exchange HUR and HUA when necessary.

2.2.  Flow-Based Routing Support

   The second requirement for supporting flow mobility is that the
   PMIPv6 should be able to bind a particular flow to a Proxy-CoA
   without affecting other flow using the same HNP.  This specification
   allows the LMA to bind a HNP to multiple Proxy-CoAs (MAGs) and then
   allows it to bind a particular flow to a Proxy-CoA.  When the LMA
   want to move a flow, it just changes the binding of the flow to
   another Proxy-CoA (MAG).

2.2.1.  Extensions to Binding Cache Entry

   When the MN attaches to the network by using multiple interfaces
   simultaneously, the LMA should bind the MN to multiple care-of
   addresses.  As provided in [2], the MN is allowed to register
   multiple care-of address for a home address.  A new binding
   identification number is created by the LMA for each binding the MN
   wants to register.

   Table 1 shows two Binding Cache Entries of the MN1 when it attaches
   to the network using two different access technologies.  Both of the
   two attachments share HNP1 and are bounded to two different Proxy-
   CoAs.

2.2.2.  Flow Binding Cache Entry List

   Each LMA must maintain a flow binding table.  This table contains
   entry for each flow sent from the MN.  A flow binding entry includes
   the following fields:

   o  Flow Identifier - Priority (FID-PRI)

   o  Flow Identifier (FID)

   o  Traffic Selector (TS)

   o  Binding Identifier (BID)

   o  Action

   o  Active/Idle

            +---------+-----+-----+------+---------+----------+
            | FID-PRI | FID |  TS | BIDs |  Action |    AI    |
            +---------+-----+-----+------+---------+----------+
            |    10   |  2  | TCP |   1  | Forward |  Active  |
            |    20   |  4  | UDP |  1,2 | Forward | Inactive |
            +---------+-----+-----+------+---------+----------+

                Table 2: The Flow Binding Cache Entry list

   The BIDs field contains the identifier of the binding cache entry
   that all of the packets matching the flow information described in
   the TS field will be forwarded to.  When the flow mobility occurs,
   the BIDs will be updated with new binding cache entry identifier.

   The detail usage of each field and the description of the example in
   table 2 are provided in [3]

3.1.1.  Sending Home Network Prefix Update Request Message

   When a HNP needed to be shared on a MAG, the LMA will send an HUR
   message including the HNP to that MAG to request it to setup tunnel
   and update the routing path for the HNP.  Depending on the way that
   implementation selects, proactive or reactive signaling approach, the
   trigger for sending an HUR message is different.  With proactive
   signaling approach, the HUR will be initiated whenever a new HNP is
   assigned to the MN.  In contrast, with the reactive signaling
   approach, the HUR will be initiated only when the LMA decides to move
   a flow and the HNP used by that flow is not valid on the destination
   MAG.

3.1.2.  Receiving Home Network Prefix Update Acknowledgement Message

   After sending HUR, the LMA waits for the HUA sent back from MAG.  On
   receiving the HUA, the LMA update binding cache to bind the HNP to an
   extra Proxy-CoA.

   Table 3 and Table 4 show the Binding Cache Entries of the MN1 before
   and after the LMA receives HUA message from the MAG2

          +---------+-----+-------+------+--------+------------+
          | BID-PRI | BID | MN-ID |  ATT | HNP(s) |  Proxy-CoA |

          |    30   |  2  |  MN1  | 3GPP |  HNP2  | IP2 (MAG2) |
          +---------+-----+-------+------+--------+------------+

         +---------+-----+-------+------+-----------+------------+

     Table 4: The Binding Cache Entry list after the LMA receiving HUA

   In the Table 3 the HNP1 is bounded to the IP1 of MAG1 only.  After
   the LMA sends HUR to request the MAG2 update with the HNP1.  Then the
   HNP1 is now also bounded IP2 of the MAG2 as showed in the Table 4

3.1.3.  Moving a Flow

   When the LMA decides to move a flow, first it checks whether the HNP
   used by the flow is valid on the destination MAG or not by checking



Tran, et al.             Expires March 17, 2011                [Page 10]

   the existing binding cache entries of the MN.  If it is valid then
   the LMA just updates the flow binding cache entry list.  If it is not
   valid then the LMA sends HUR message to request the destination MAG
   to update with the HNP used by the flow.  After that if the MAG sends
   an HUA message to the LMA.  The LMA will update the binding cache
   entry to bind the HNP to new Proxy-CoA and then updates the flow
   binding entry list to forward the flow to the new updated binding
   cache entry.

   Table 5 and Table 6 show the flow binding list entry before and after
   it is updated.  In the Table 5, the flow 1 is associated with the
   binding cache entry 1.  It means that the flow 1 is forwarded via the
   Proxy-CoA of the MAG1.  After that the LMA updates the flow binding
   list entry with new binding cache entry 2.  The flow 1 is now
   associated with the Proxy-CoA 2 of the MAG2 as shown in the Table 6.

3.2.  Mobile Access Gateway Operation

3.2.1.  Receiving Home Network Prefix Update Request Message

   On receiving the HUR message, the MAG sets up its endpoint of the bi-
   directional tunnel to the LMA and also sets up the routing path for
   the traffic using HNP included in the HUR.

3.2.2.  Sending Home Network Prefix Update Acknowledgement Message

   After setting up the tunnel and routing path for new HNP
   successfully, the MAG sends HUA including the HNP to inform the LMA

   that the flows using HNP can be forwarded via the MAG.

3.3.  Mobile Node Operation

   For simplicity, we assume that the MN uses a single logical interface
   to hide all of its available physical interfaces.  The detail
   discussion about LGI is provided in [4].

   On receiving a downlink traffic flow, the MN selects the same path
   for sending the uplink traffic flow.  For example, if the mobile node
   attaches to the network using two physical interfaces, IF1 and IF2.
   If the downlink traffic of the flow 1 is received from the IF1 then
   the uplink traffic of the flow 1 will also be sent via the IF1.  When
   the flow 1 is moved to attachment of the IF2, then the path for
   sending uplink traffic of the flow 1 is also changed to the IF2.

   A new flag (F) is included in the Binding Update Massage to indicate
   to the LMA that the MN can support flow mobility.  This field is
   necessary only when the LMA cannot acquire information about flow
   mobility capacity of the MN from the MN's policy profile.  In this
   case, the MN will signal the MAG about its flow mobility capacity by
   using layer 2.5 signaling message.  The MAG then set the value of F
   flag to inform the LMA about the flow mobility capacity of the MN.
   The F flag MUST be set to 1 if the MN can support flow mobility and
   MUST be set to 0 if the MN cannot support flow mobility.
