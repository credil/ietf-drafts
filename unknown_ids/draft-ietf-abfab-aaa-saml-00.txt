                  An AAA Attribute for SAML Constructs
                      draft-ietf-abfab-aaa-saml-00

Abstract

   This document defines the SAML-Construct attribute for use with AAA
   protocols.  This attribute is used for encapsulating Security
   Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML) constructs.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines the SAML-Construct attribute for use with AAA
   protocols.  This attribute encapsulates Security Assertion Mark-up
   Language (SAML) constructs.

3.  SAML Construct Attribute

   This attribute contains a SAML construct.  This attribute MAY be used
   with any AAA protocol that can use RADIUS-formatted attributes, such
   as RADIUS [RFC2865] or DIAMETER [RFC3588].  Where multiple SAML-
   Construct attributes are included in an AAA protocol message (for
   example, a RADIUS packet), the Construct field of the attributes are
   to be concatenated to form a SAML construct.

   A summary of the SAML-Construct format is shown below.  The fields
   are transmitted from left to right.

   Length  >=4

   Construct Type (CT)  The Construct Type field is a one octet
      enumerated field.  It takes an integer value denoting the type of
      SAML construct in the Construct field.  TBD SAML Request protocol
      element TBD SAML Response protocol element All other values are
      reserved for IANA allocation subject to the provisions of section
      5.

   Construct  The Construct field is one or more octets containing a
      SAML construct.  If larger than a single attribute, the SAML
      construct data MUST be split on 253- octet boundaries over as many
      attributes as necessary.  On reception, the SAML construct is
      reconstructed by concatenating the contents of all SAML-Construct
      attributes.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The following numbers have been assigned in the RADIUS Attribute
   Types registry.  A new RADIUS Attribute Type: SAML-Construct (TDB)
   The enumerated values of the newly registered RADIUS Attribute Type
   as defined in this document were assigned at the same time as the new
   Attribute Type.  For the SAML-Construct Attribute:

   TBD  SAML Request protocol element

   TBD  SAML Response protocol element

   Assignments of additional enumerated values for the RADIUS attributes
   defined in this document are to be processed as described in
   [RFC3575], subject to the additional requirements of a published
   specification.
