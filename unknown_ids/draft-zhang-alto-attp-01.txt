1. Introduction 

   Currently P2P applications take a large share in total network 
   traffic. According to the recent record of China Telecom, one of the 
   biggest ISP in China, P2P applications account for more than 50% of 
   the Internet traffic in the daytime and 90% at night. Meanwhile the 
   ISP international outport is jammed seriously by P2P applications 
   almost all the time. The problem of cross-ISP traffic is serious 
   which will bring out great cross-ISP traffic billing as well as 
   network management and operation cost for ISPs.

Internet-Draft                   P2P Traffic Localization by Alias Tracker      July 2008 
    

   The purpose of this document is to specify a cooperative tracker   
   building mechanism aligned with tracker-based P2P application 
   providers to improve the seed selection mechanism for Tracker-based 
   P2P applications. This mechanism doesn't change current P2P software 
   and can make node selection consistent with physical topology, so 
   cross-ISP traffic can be effectively reduced and the cost of network 
   equipment and network operation is largely cut off. 

1.1. Terminology 

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",   
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT   
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as   
   described RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 

   This section defines some key concepts using in this document. 

   Tracker:  A server which assists in the communication between live       
     peers. It is a major critical point. Clients communicate with       
     the tracker to get peer list. After initiate downloads clients       
     communicate with the tracker periodically to negotiate with newer       
     peers. 

   Tracker-based application:  We denote P2P file sharing applications       
     like Bittorent and P2P streaming (both live and VOD) applications       
     like PPlive as tracker-based applications. In a P2P tracker-based       
     system, each end node requests seed/leecher list from the tracker.  

   Seed Node/Leecher node:  P2P clients that can provide data to other       
     clients, allowing other clients to download p2p data. They register       
     themselves at the tracker and refresh information periodically. The       
     difference in seed Node and leecher node is just how much it holds       
     the shared files. A seed holds the whole parts of the specific 
     files. 

   DNS Redirection:  A technique on the Internet for making a domain 
     name available under many IP address. Through this technique user 
     request to a domain name can be redirected to a new address. 

2. Overview 

   Currently P2P applications accounts for significant traffic on the    
   Internet, For example, in China some P2P applications including    
   Bittorent[4] PPlive[5] have take 75% share of total P2P traffic. 
   Such applications are all tracker-based. The tracker selects nodes 
   without any knowledge about the physical topology. That causes a 
   serious mismatch between physical topology and application topology

   and it contributes to most P2P cross-ISP traffic, which will bring 
   great network operation cost for ISPs. 

   These P2P applications are tracker-based and we mainly focus on this    
   type of P2P applications because its traffic dominance in the 
   Internet. In this document we will take Bittorent as an example to 
   describe the problem and the related solutions. Obviously it can be 
   used in other tracker-based P2P applications.   

   As showed in Figure 1 there are three components in Bittorent: 
   tracker, websites and end nodes. The website provides resource 
   information published by end nodes about which files others can 
   download. Other end nodes visit the website to search the target 
   files and then download related torrent files; the trackers is an 
   index server which maintains seed nodes/leecher nodes list that can 
   provide files data and it returns nodes list to end nodes after they 
   request. After receiving the corresponding nodes list, the requesting 
   end node then connects the seed nodes/leecher nodes to request the 
   file blocks and download file blocks from these nodes when these 
   nodes allow its request. 

   In current mechanism the cross-ISP traffic will be great. The most    
   important reason is that trackers select some seed nodes/leecher 
   nodes and return them to end nodes without knowledge of physical 
   topology. End nodes will contact these seed nodes/leecher nodes to 
   download P2P data. If two nodes don't belong to the same ISP, cross-
   network traffic will be unavoidable.

3. ISP's Considerations on ISP-P2P application provider align 

   In a word, node clustering and localization is very important for    
   reducing cross-ISP traffic. The basic idea is to let operators/ISPs 
   and service providers of P2P application cooperate with node 
   clustering and localization. On one hand, operators totally know 
   their own network topology. They can effectively manage and classify 
   inner nodes of operator's network. On the other hand if service 
   providers of P2P application want to make node localized they have to 
   have some knowledge of the network topology and other information. 

   There are several choices in the use of network topologys. One choice 
   is that the operator provides topology and/or bandwidth information 
   to P2P applications. The other choice is that P2P applications 
   provides live nodes information to the operator and the operator 
   makes the decision of node clustering and localization based on its 
   network knowledge.

   Because the topology and/or bandwidth information is are important 
   and private for the operator,it's difficult to make it public for 
   security consideration becuse: 

   1) Malicious nodes/parties may use such information to launch network 
   attack; 

   2) It may affect the fairness of network to applications if P2P       
   application is the basic users of such services; So it's a good 
   choice for operators to provide node localization decision themselves 
   with the help of P2P application providers. In this document we 
   propose one mechanism to reduce cross-ISP traffic for Tracker-based 
   P2P applications.  

   It has some advantages: 

   1) It can keep operator independence and privacy; 

   2) It can make full use of operator's knowledge to reduce cross-ISP       
   traffic; 

   3) it don't add more burdens for the P2P application providers to 
   make node and request localization decision and it make increase the       
   application performance(esp. decreasing latency and increasing       
   throughput by localization). So it's a double-will game. 

    

4. ATTP: One mechanism for Tracker-based P2P applications 

4.1. Architecture 

   ATTP (Alias Tracker for Tracker-based P2P applications)is proposed in    
   this document to reduce the cross-ISP traffic. Three kinds of new    
   components/mechanisms are introduced in ATTP. We create a mirror-P2P    
   environment in home network by the cooperation with original P2P    
   application. The first new component is called Alias tracker. It is    
   controlled by the operators and is a cooperative component with 
   original tracker in P2P applications.  

   The second new component is inner resource website. The Resource 
   websites is similar to the websites in Bittorent. The most popular 
   resource information and the related torrent files will be issued 
   here. The inner nodes will be redirected to resource websites when 
   they try to visit Bittorent websites residing in foreign networks.  


 
 
zhang & liao          Expires February 1, 2009                [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft                   P2P Traffic Localization by Alias Tracker      July 2008 
    

   The third part is a redirection mechanism in inner DNS server. When 
   inner nodes visit the original Bittorent website, ip address of this 
   website should be gotten from inner DNS server. When inner DNS server 
   receives the request, it will return the IP address of the mirror 
   resource website. So inner nodes will be automatically redirected to 
   resource website.  

   Alias Tracker is designed to provide peer index service for inner 
   nodes. It monitors live seed/leecher information in the Internet 
   scale and when inner nodes request peer list, it will first return 
   the inner nodes. One special case is that all the nodes return by 
   alias tracker are local nodes of operator's network. 

   Alias Tracker can reduce the cross-ISP traffic effectively between    
   different operator networks through returning inner nodes as more as 
   it can. If we just depend on the original BT websites and BT trackers 
   we can not achieve the goals because operators can not control the BT    
   trackers that may not in operator's network.  

   Alias Tracker is deployed in operator's network. In order to make 
   users automatically visit Alias tracker, some resource description 
   information (such as .torrent in Bittorent) should be changed to 
   amend the original tracker address to be Alias tracker address. 

   Through ATTP local nodes will be first recommended in the node list 
   to download file blocks thus the network traffic could be reduced 
   greatly for P2P application. 

   We take Bittorent as an example to describe the architecture as 
   Figure 2.

   Firstly alias tracker obtains a list of N files which are downloaded    
   most often at the most popular Bittorent websites. The parameter N    
   can be adjusted according to the service ability of Alias tracker   
   (Another way is to get the files information that are downloaded most    
   often from the Web Cache servers which are deployed widely .Then 
   Alias tracker obtains the resource description files of above files 
   from Bittorent websites (such as .torrent files for BT).It may 
   cooperate with the original BT websites or simply act as normal 
   Bittorent client to get the description files. We change the original 
   tracker address in the .torrent files to the address of the alias 
   tracker (it is easy to be changed because it is plain text). Then the 
   new resource description files are issued to the resource website in 
   inner operator's network. The operator use DNS redirection [RFC2234] 
   or other application layer redirection to change the user request 
   from Bittorent website to the resource website in operator's network. 
   When users want to visit the original BT website, actually they will 
   visit the resource website in inner operator network. Users will 
   contact alias tracker through analyzing the .torrent file form the 
   resource website in operator's network.

   Obviously by this means inner nodes will request the Alias tracker 
   for file downloading. Alias tracker functions similar to BT Tracker 
   server It maintains the seed/leecher nodes lists that can provide 
   files data which are listed in the resource website in the home 
   network. And it will return related nodes list when end users request. 

   To further improve the downloading performance, an enhanced tracker    
   communication procedure between original tracker and alias tracker is    
   defined in ATTP to increase the amount of available seed/leechers. 
   Alias tracker gets the outside seed/leecher node list of the files 
   from BT tracker. Again this can be achieved by the proactive report 
   from the original tracker or reactive request as a normal P2P client.  

   When Alias tracker return seed/leecher nodes list, it will follow the    
   following policies: 

   a) If the amount of inner nodes of the ISP's network is enough, all 
   of the nodes that are returned by alias tracker are inner nodes. 

   b) If the amount of inner nodes is not enough it should return all 
   the inner nodes and some foreign nodes. 

   At last the end nodes will download the files from the seed nodes    
   returned by alias tracker. 

4.3. Advantages of ATTP 

   ATTP just needs some alias trackers and website built up by the 
   operator and only need configure DNS re-direction mechanism to 
   achieve above goals. The cost is low and the deployment is simple. It 
   can make operators keep independence and privacy when making full use 
   of operator's advantages. And it don't add more burdens for the P2P    
   application providers to make node and request localization decision    
   and it make increase the application performance(esp. decreasing    
   latency and increasing throughput by localization). So it's a    
   double-will game.

7. Conclusions 

   This document describes a novel method to reduce cross-ISP traffic in    
   P2P tracker-based applications such as Bittorrent and PPlive. 

   Through cooperating ISP with P2P application providers, ATTP acts as 
   a mirror P2P application provider in its home network to lower    
   cross-network traffic.
