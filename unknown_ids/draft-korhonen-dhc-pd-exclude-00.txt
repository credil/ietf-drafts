Internet-Draft              PD Exclude Option                  July 2010


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines an optional mechanism and the related
   DHCPv6 option to allow exclusion of one or more specific prefixes
   from a delegated prefix set when using DHCPv6-based prefix
   delegation.

   The prefix excluding mechanism is targeted to deployments where
   DHCPv6-based prefix delegation is desired to be used but unnumbered
   router model is not available.  The mechanism defined in this
   specification allows requesting router to use a prefix out of
   delegated prefix set on its link through which it exchanges DHCPv6
   messages with the delegating router.  Furthermore, the specification
   allows the delegating router proactively to delegate prefix(es) with
   'holes' in the delegated prefix(es).


2.  Requirements and Terminology

2.1.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   Addition to the terminology defined in [RFC3315] and [RFC3633] is
   also used.


3.  Prefix Delegation with Excluded Prefixes

3.1.  Problem Background

   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) [RFC3633] has an explicit
   limitation described in Section 12.1 of [RFC3633] that the requesting
   router MUST NOT assign any delegated prefixes or subnets from the
   delegated prefix(es) to the link through which it received the DHCP
   message from the delegating router.  This approach applies well to
   unnumbered router model.  Also the same approach applies to the case
   where the prefix assigned to the requesting router link through which
   it received DHCP messages does not need to be in any way associated
   to the delegated prefixes.  However, in deployments where the prefix
   assigned to the requesting router's uplink and the delegated prefixes
   have to be tightly correlated, and actually the prefix assigned to
   the link to which the router is attached must be from the delegated
   prefixes, then the [RFC3633] as such is not enough.  This concerns

Internet-Draft              PD Exclude Option                  July 2010


   especially mobile wireless router deployments, where the link between
   the requesting router and the delegating router must always be
   assigned a valid prefix.

3.2.  Solution

   One solution to circumvent the limitations of [RFC3633] is defining a
   new DHCPv6 option that allows excluding one or more prefixes from the
   delegated prefix set.  This specification defines a new option,
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE (TBD1), that is used to exclude one or more
   prefixes from the delegated prefix defined in the OPTION_IAPREFIX.
   The OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE MUST only be included in the OPTION_IAPREFIX
   IAprefix-options field.  There can be zero or more OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE
   options in one OPTION_IAPREFIX option.  Effectively, the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option allows a prefix delegation where a mobile
   router in the requesting router role is delegated one prefix (e.g.
   /56) and the requesting router configures its link through which it
   exchanges DHCPv6 messages with the delegating router using a prefix
   out of the delegated prefix set.  Alternatively the delegating router
   can proactively delegate prefix(es) to the requesting router with
   'holes' in the delegated prefix set, for example in cases where the
   delegating router would not otherwise be able to satisfy requesting
   router's request at all.  Both delegating router and requesting
   router are aware of these 'certain' prefixes using the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option and act then accordingly.

   The requesting router places the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option in the
   corresponding OPTION_IAPREFIX option to inform the delegating router
   about the support or a desire to exclude specific prefix(es) from the
   delegated prefix set.  If the requesting router knows in advance the
   prefix(ex) that must be excluded or must not be part of any delegated
   prefix set, such as prefixes used in requesting router's uplink
   interface, then those prefixes MUST be included in the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE.  If the requesting router includes a prefix
   configured on its link in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option, the
   requesting router MUST have obtained the prefix using some means
   (e.g.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration, or DHCPv6) before
   requesting the delegating router for prefixes.  Otherwise, the
   requesting router just includes an undefined address (i.e. '::') as
   an indication to the delegating router that it understands a
   delegation where some specific prefix(es) MAY be excluded.  The
   requesting router must create sink routes for the delegated prefixes
   minus the excluded prefixes.  This may be done by creating sink
   routes for delegated prefixes and more specific routes for the
   excluded prefixes.

   The delegating router MAY include the undefined address in the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE as an indication that the option was understood but

Internet-Draft              PD Exclude Option                  July 2010


   there is no reason to exclude any prefix(es) from the delegated
   prefix set.  Otherwise, the delegating router includes the prefix(es)
   in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option that are excluded from the delegated
   prefix set and the requesting router MUST NOT assign to its own
   subscriber networks.

   The absence of the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE in the OPTION_IAPREFIX option in
   either direction (from a requesting router to a delegating router, or
   vice versa) implies that the feature defined in this specification is
   not supported.

   In order to use the mechanism defined in this specification, the
   delegating router and the address/prefix management entity assigning
   prefixes to the requesting router (e.g. a mobile router) MUST be
   tightly synchronized.  Otherwise, the delegating router cannot really
   delegate prefix(es) that would already contain the prefix(es) the
   requesting router included in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option.

      prefix MUST be zero padded to the next full octet boundary.
      Trailing zero octets of the prefix SHOULD NOT be encoded into the
      prefix field.  The unspecified address MUST NOT be encoded at all.

   OPTION_IAPREFIX IAprefix-options [RFC3633] field.  The

   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option(s) MUST be located before the possible
   Status Code option in the IAprefix-options field.

   Any prefix excluded from the delegated prefix MUST be contained in
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE options(s) within the corresponding
   OPTION_IAPREFIX.  Therefore, the excluded prefix(es) MUST be part of
   the prefix carried in the OPTION_IAPREFIX option, when the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE is anything else than the unspecified address '::'.

   Prefix(es) included in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option(s) share the same
   preferred-lifetime and valid-lifetime as the delegated prefix in the
   'parent' OPTION_IAPREFIX option.


5.  Delegating Router Solicitation

   The requesting router locates and selects a delegating router in the
   same way as described in Section 11 [RFC3633].  This specification
   only describes the additional steps required by the use of
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option.

5.1.  Requesting Router

   The requesting router may have prefixes in use that it wishes the
   delegating router to be aware of; such as the prefix(es) assigned to
   the link it uses to send and receive DHCPv6 messages with the
   delegating router.  In this case the requesting router MUST include
   the prefix(es) into the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option in the
   OPTION_IAPREFIX within the IA_PD option.  For example, the requesting
   would include the /64 prefix assigned to the link it uses to send and
   receive DHCPv6 messages (this applies to the deployment case when
   unnumbered router model is not used).

   Once receiving Advertisement message, the requesting router uses the
   prefix(es) received in OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE in addition to the
   advertised prefixes to choose the delegating router to respond to.
   If Advertisement message did not include OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option or
   the prefix in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option contains an undefined
   address (i.e. '::'), then the requesting router MUST fall back to
   normal [RFC3633] behavior.

5.2.  Delegating Router

   If the requesting router included the IA_PD Prefix option with the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option (within the OPTION_IAPREFIX IAprefix-
   options) in the Solicit message, the delegating router MAY use the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option provided information to assist the selection
   of the prefix(es) to be delegated to the requesting router.  For

Internet-Draft              PD Exclude Option                  July 2010


   example, if the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option in the Solicit message
   contains the prefix 2001:db8:abad:cafe::/64, then the delegating
   router could delegate 2001:db8:abad:ca00::/56 (included in the
   OPTION_IAPREFIX option) to the requesting router and state that 2001:
   db8:abad:cafe::/64 is excluded from the delegated prefix using the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option within the OPTION_IAPREFIX IAprefix-options.

   If the prefix in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE sent by the requesting router
   is not part of the prefix delegating router is delegating, the prefix
   in OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE shall be ignored as irrelevant.

   If the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option contains an undefined address (i.e.
   '::') that informs the delegating router that the requesting router
   implements the mechanism defined in this specification.  In this case
   the delegating router MAY choose to delegated prefix(es) with one or
   more prefixes excluded from the otherwise continuous prefix set.

   If the delegating router knows its address pool for delegation cannot
   possibly be in conflict with prefix(es) used in requesting router's
   uplink(s), it MAY choose to ignore all OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE options
   requesting routers send.

   If the delegating router chooses to delegate but not to exclude any
   prefix(es) it MUST include the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option containing an
   undefined address (i.e. '::') in the OPTION_IAPREFIX option within
   the IA_PD option.


6.  Requesting Router Initiated Prefix Delegation

   The procedures described in the following sections are aligned with
   Section 12 of [RFC3633].  In this specification we only describe the
   additional steps required by the use of OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option.

6.1.  Requesting Router

   The requesting router behavior regarding the use of the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option is more or less identical to step described
   in Section 5.1.  The only difference really is DHCPv6 messages used
   to carry the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option(s).

   The requesting router uses a Release message to return the delegated
   prefix(es) to a delegating router.  The prefix(es) to be released
   MUST be included in the IA_PDs along with the excluded prefix(es)
   included in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option.  The requesting router MUST
   NOT use the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option to introduce additional excluded
   prefix(es) in the Release message that it originally got a valid
   binding for.

   The requesting router must create sink routes for the delegated
   prefixes minus the excluded prefixes.  This may be done by creating
   sink routes for delegated prefixes and more specific routes for the
   excluded prefixes.

6.2.  Delegating Router

   The delegating router behavior regarding the use of the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option is more or less identical to step described
   in Section 5.2.  The only difference really is DHCPv6 messages used
   to carry the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option(s).

   The delegating router MAY choose, at any time, to delegate the
   requesting router with a prefix with one or more prefixes excluded
   from it.  For example, the delegating router may delegate 2001:db8:
   dead:ba00::/56 prefix to the requesting router but specifically
   exclude 2001:db8:dead:bab0::/60 prefix from it.  Effectively, the
   requesting router gets delegated 240 usable prefixes instead of 256.

   The delegating router may mark any prefix(es) in IA_PD Prefix options
   in a Release message from a requesting router as 'available'
   excluding prefix(es) included in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE options(s).
   If the Release message contains 'new' excluded prefix(es) in any
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option, the delegating router MUST send a Reply
   message with Status Code set to NoBinding for that IA_PD option.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations in DHCPv6 are described in Section 23 of
   [RFC3315], and for DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in Section 12 of
   [RFC3633].

   A malicious requesting router may unnecessarily fragment the
   delegating router prefix pools and cause additional load on the
   delegating router by defining excluded prefix(es).  The excluded
   prefix(es) may cause the delegating router to react to neighbor
   discovery messages other than just ignoring them.


8.  IANA Considerations

   A new DHCPv6 Option Code is reserved from DHCPv6 registry for DHCP
   Option Codes.

       OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE   is set to TBD1
