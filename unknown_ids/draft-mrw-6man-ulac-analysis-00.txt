Abstract

   There has been discussion within the IETF IPv6 community for some
   time regarding whether or not to define Centrally Assigned Unique
   Local Addresses (ULA-Cs).  Although many arguments both for and
   against the definition of ULA-Cs have been raised and repeated, our
   discussions have not resulted in consensus about whether or not to
   define this new address type.  This document will summarize the
   arguments for and against the allocation of ULA-Cs, in an attempt to
   help the IETF IPv6 community reach a decision on this issue.

Internet-Draft               ULA-C Analysis                November 2007


1.  Introduction

   Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) are defined in RFC 4193 [RFC4193],
   which defines a local assignment method to be used for half of the
   ULA address space.  RFC 4193 reserves the other half of the ULA space
   for ULAs that are assigned using another assignment method, without
   specifying what method that would be.

   ULAs are largely targeted at fulfilling the need for local, Internet
   Service Provider (ISP)-independent prefixes that can be used on
   isolated networks, internal networks and VPNs.  Enterprise
   administrators do not want to use Provider Assigned addresses for
   these purposes, because they want to avoid the need to renumber their
   internal, private networks when they change ISPs, or when their ISPs
   merge with other ISPs or restructure their address allocations.

   Locally Assigned ULAs are generated within the local enterprise,
   either by the network administrator or a piece of networking
   equipment, using a random number generator.  These addresses are
   probabilistically unique, in the sense that it is extremely unlikely
   that there will be an overlap within any reasonable small number of
   Centrally Assigned ULA prefixes.

   Locally Assigned ULAs meet most of the local addressing needs that
   have been expressed, and their probabilistic uniqueness represents a
   significant advantage over the overlapping private address space
   available in IPv4.  However, there have been some arguments that we
   should also define a centrally assigned set of ULAs, to meet some
   needs that are not fully handled by the locally allocated ones.

   The IETF IPv6 community (originally represented by the IPv6 WG, but
   now represented by the IPv6 Maintenance (6man) WG) has not been able
   to achieve consensus, over a period of several years, regarding
   whether or not to define Centrally Allocated ULAs to inhabit the
   other half of the ULA address space.  The document has been written
   in an attempt to clearly document the different sides of this issue,
   in the hope that we can achieve a consensus decision on how to
   proceed.


2.  The Benefits of ULA-Cs

   To understand the benefits of Centrally Assigned ULAs in a world that
   already has Locally Assigned ULAs available, we need to discuss what
   benefits Centrally Assigned ULAs will provide that are not already
   covered by Locally Assigned ULAs.  These benefits stem from the
   differences between Locally Assigned and Centrally Assigned ULAs: the
   greater certainty that ULA-Cs will be unique, the publicly

   accountable nature of the registration, and the ability for ULA-Cs to
   be registered in the reverse DNS.

2.1.  Greater Assurance of Uniqueness

   In some cases, local enterprise networks extend beyond the boundaries
   of a single enterprise, connecting a set of trading partners, or
   connecting a business and its customers, to a single private network.
   Many of these inter-enterprise private networks exist today, and they
   can be quite large in some cases.

   In cases where ULA prefixes will be used for these large, private,
   inter-enterprise networks, it may be important that the ULA prefix
   assigned to the private network does not conflict with any of the
   prefixes used internally by the participating enterprises, including
   the prefixes used by those enterprises on other private inter-
   enterprise networks with overlappign membership.  To ensure that this
   requirement is met, some network administrators would prefer to use
   prefixes, such as ULA-Cs, that have a greater probability of
   uniqueness than Locally Assigned ULAs.

2.2.  Accountability

   ULA-Cs are assigned by a central registry that keeps a record of the
   assignment.  This means that if a conflict does arise where two
   enterprises are using the same Centrally Allocated ULA prefix, it is
   possible for an enterprise administrator to prove that the prefix was
   assigned to his/her company, and that his/her enterprise has the
   right to use it.

   The use of Centrally Assigned ULAs also has some advantages for
   tracking the source of any local traffic that may leak into another
   enterprise network or onto the Internet.  Because the prefix has been
   centrally assigned, it should be possible to check who owns the
   prefix and contact them about the problem.

2.3.  Reverse DNS

   One of the major advantages of Centrally Assigned ULAs over Locally
   Assigned ULAs is that it is possible for the Centrally Assigned ULA
   prefixes to be populated in the global Reverse DNS.  Since these
   addresses may be routed across private networks between enterprises,
   it isn't reasonable to assume that all of the nodes on a private
   network will be configured to use a single DNS server that can run
   "two-faced" DNS to reflect the internal addresses.  In these cases,
   it may be valuable to have these addresses populated in the global
   Reverse DNS tree.  This would be possible with ULA-Cs, because of
   their centrally-allocated nature.

3.  The Costs of ULA-Cs

   This section attempts to summarize the costs associated with the
   definition of ULA-Cs.  Additional concerns regarding the definition
   of ULA-Cs are covered in the followign section.

3.1.  Address Space Consumption

   From an address space perspective, there is little or no cost to
   defining ULA-Cs.  RFC 4193 allocates the prefix FCOO::/7 to be used
   for Unique Local Addresses.  One half of that space (the prefix
   FD00::/8) is allocated for Locally Assigned ULAs, while the other
   half of the space (the prefix FC00::/8) is reserved for ULAs that use
   another assignment method.  The ULA-C draft proposes that remaining
   half of that space (the FC00::/8 prefix) should be used for Centrally
   Assigned ULAs.

3.2.  New Registration Method

   ULA-Cs would require an additional type of address registration,
   which would involve some costs to the larger Internet community.
   However, if there is any signficant demand for ULA-Cs, it is likely
   that these costs could be recouped from the ULA-C registration fees.


4.  Other Concerns about ULA-Cs

   In addition to the costs associated with defining ULA-Cs, a number of
   concerns have been raised regarding the value of ULA-C prefixes and
   how they might be used or abused.  This section attempts to summarize
   those concerns.

4.1.  Lack of Value

   Although there are some benefits of ULA-Cs listed in section
   Section 2, it has been argued that the benefits of ULA-Cs are not
   sufficient to warrant the corresponding complexity that will be added
   to the IPv6 standard or the effort of setting up a centralized
   registration mechanism.  The vast majority of the benefits that can
   be obtained using ULA-Cs can also be obtained using Locally Assigned
   ULAs, which are already defined and do not require any central
   registration process.  In most cases where enterprise administrators
   argue that they need a higher likelihood of uniqueness, it is not
   actually the case that their application will substantially benefit
   from the different between probabilistic uniqueness and more
   deterministic uniqueness.

4.2.  Use as Globally Routed Provider Independent Addresses

   There is a widely-held view in the Internet operations community that
   ULA-Cs will end-up being routed across the Internet and will,
   effectively, result in the unlimited allocation of globally routed
   Provider Independent (PI) addresses.  Since these addresses would not
   be allocated by ISPs in an aggregable fashion, it is expected that
   they would result in separate per-enterprise routes in the global
   routing table, as PI addresses from teh IPv4 "swamp space" do today.
   If ULA-Cs were widely used in this fashion, the global routing tables
   for IPv6 could become large enough to compromise the stability of the
   Internet.

4.3.  Enabling IPv6 NAT

   Some have argued that the definition of ULA-Cs will provide a
   suitable set of addresses for use behind an IPv6-to-IPv6 NAT box, and
   that we should not define these addresses to avoid that situation.
   However, ULA-Cs provide no significant benefits to NAT installations
   that cannot be achieved with Locally Assigned ULAs, so it is unlikely
   that defining ULA-Cs will have much effect, in either direction, on
   whether enterprises decide to use NAT for IPv6 networks.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document analyzes the tradeoffs involved in whether or not to
   define a new IPv6 local address type called Centrally Allocated ULAs
   (ULA-Cs).  Security considerations regarding ULAs, in general, can be
   found in RFC 4193 [RFC4193], and security considerations regarding
   Centrally Assigned ULAs, in particular, can be found in the ULA-C
   draft [I-D.ietf-ipv6-ula-central].
