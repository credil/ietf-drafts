		<abstract>
		<t>
		There have been many implementations and deployments of legacy syslog over TCP for many 
		years.  That protocol has evolved without being standardized and has proven to be quite 
		interoperable in practice.  The aim of this specification is to explain how TCP has been 
		used as a transport for syslog messages.
		</t>
		</abstract>

		<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t>
		Historically, the <xref target="RFC3164">syslog protocol</xref> has been run over UDP.
		This has been replaced with the <xref target="RFC5424">standardized syslog protocol</xref>
		in which the <xref target="RFC5425">TLS transport</xref> is required.  Even so, there are 
		many instances of syslog running atop TCP <xref target="RFC0793" />.  
		</t>
		<t>
		Two primary format options have been observed with legacy 
		syslog being transported over TCP.  These have been called non-transparent-framing and 
		octet-counting.  The non-transparent-framing mechanism has some inherent problems.
		</t>
		<t>
		Diagram 1 shows how all of these syslog transports relate to each other.
		In this diagram three originators are seen, labeled A, B, and C, along with one collector.
		Originator A is using the TCP transport which is described in this document.  Originator
		B is using the UDP transport which is described in <xref target="RFC5426" />.  Originator
		C is using the TLS transport which is described in <xref target="RFC5425" />.  The 
		collector is shown with the capability to accept all three transports.

		<section anchor="conventions" title="Conventions Used in This Document">
			<t>
			The terminology defined in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC5424" /> is
			used throughout this specification.  The reader should be familiar with
			that to follow this discussion.
			</t>
			<t>
			This document also references devices that use the syslog message format
			as described in <xref target="RFC3164" />.  Devices that continue to use that 
			message format (regardless of transport) will be described as &quot;legacy
			syslog devices&quot;.  Similarly, devices that use the 
			message format as described in <xref target="RFC5424" /> will be described
			as &quot;standardized syslog devices&quot;.
			</t>
		</section>
		
		<section anchor="using" title="Message Transmission">
			<t>
			Syslog is simplex in nature.  It has been observed that implementations of syslog over 
			TCP also do not use any backchannel mechanism to convey information to the transport 
			sender, and consequently do not use any application-level acknowledgement for syslog 
			receiver to sender signaling.  Message receipt acknowledgement, reliability, and flow 
			control are provided by the capabilities of TCP.
			</t>
		<section anchor="charset" title="Character Set">
			<t>
			For syslog over TCP messages no indication of the character set being used is given.
			In these messages, various character sets have been observed, with US-ASCII being 
			predominant.  
			</t><t>
			The message header is usually expected and provided in US-ASCII, only. This has been
			observed even in cases where a different encoding has been used for the MSG part. 
			However, non-US-ASCII characters may be present inside the header.  In that
			case, some syslog applications have been know to experience problems processing those 
			messages.
			</t><t>
			In some cases, it has been observed that characters outside of the range 
			of %d32 to %d126 (inclusive) are often being transformed by receivers in an effort 
			to "escape control characters".  Some receiver implementations simply drop those 
			characters.  This is considered to be a poor practice as it causes problems with 
			various character sets, most notably Unicode and Asian character sets.
			</t><t>
			It has also been observed that relays will forward messages using the character sets
			of messages they receive.  In the case where two different senders are using different
			character sets, the relay will forward each message to a collector in that character 
			set.  The collector of these messages will have to be prepared to receive messages 
			from the same transport sender with different encodings.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="session" title="Session">
			<t>
			A syslog over TCP session is a TCP connection between a syslog transport sender
			and a syslog transport receiver.  The syslog transport sender is the TCP host that
			initiates the TCP session.  After initiation, messages are sent from the transport
			sender to the transport receiver.  No application-level data is transmitted
			from the transport receiver to the transport sender.  The roles of transport
			sender and receiver seem to be fixed once the session is established.
			</t>
			<t>
			If an error occurs that cannot be corrected by TCP, the host detecting the error  
			gracefully closes the TCP session.  There have been no application level messages seen
			that were
			sent to notify the other host about the state of the host syslog application.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="sessionInit" title="Session Initiation">
			<t>
			The TCP host that intends to act as a syslog transport receiver listens to TCP port 
			&lt;TBD&gt;.  The TCP host that intends to act as the transport sender initiates a 
			TCP session to the syslog transport receiver as specified in <xref target="RFC0793" />.  
			</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="msgxfer" title="Message Transfer">
			<t>
			Syslog over TCP has been around for a number of years.  Just like legacy syslog over 
			UDP, different implementations exist.  The older method of non-transparent-framing has 
			problems.  The newer method of octet-counting is reliable and is usually preferred.
			</t>
			<t>
			In both of these methods, during the message transfer phase, the syslog transport 
			sender sends a stream of messages to the transport receiver.  These are sent in 
			sequence and one message is encapsulated inside each TCP frame.  Either of the TCP 
			hosts may initiate session closure at any time as specified in Section 3.5 
			of <xref target="RFC0793" />.  In practice, this is often seen
			after a prolonged period of inactivity.
			</t>
			<section anchor="octcount" title="Octet Counting">
				<t>
                This framing allows for the transmission of all characters inside a syslog message
                and is similar to the method used in <xref target="RFC5425" />. 
				A transport receiver uses the defined message length to
				delimit a syslog message.  As noted in <xref target="RFC3164" /> the upper 
				limit for a legacy syslog message length is 1024 octets.  That length has been
				expanded for standardized syslog.
				</t>
				<t>
				It can be assume that octet-counting framing is used
				if a syslog frame starts with a digit.
				</t>
				<t>
				All syslog messages can be considered to be TCP "data" as per 
				<xref target="RFC0793">Transmission Control Protocol</xref>.
				The syslog message stream has the following <xref target="RFC5234">ABNF</xref>
				definition:
				<figure>
				<artwork><![CDATA[
    TCP-DATA = *SYSLOG-FRAME

    SYSLOG-FRAME = MSG-LEN SP SYSLOG-MSG   ; Octet-counting 
                                           ; method

    MSG-LEN = NONZERO-DIGIT *DIGIT

    SP = %d32

    NONZERO-DIGIT = %d49-57

    DIGIT = %d48 / NONZERO-DIGIT

    SYSLOG-MSG is defined in the syslog protocol [RFC5424] and may
               also be considered to be the payload in [RFC3164]

				]]></artwork>
				</figure>
				</t>
				<t>
				MSG-LEN is the octet count of the SYSLOG-MSG in the SYSLOG-FRAME.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section anchor="octstuff" title="Non-Transparing-Framing">
			<t>
			The non-transparent-framing method inserts a syslog message into a frame and terminates it 
			with a TRAILER character.  The TRAILER has usually been a single
			character and most often is US-ASCII LF (%d10).  However, other characters have also 
			been seen, with US-ASCII NUL (%d00) being a prominent example.  Some devices have also
			been seen to emit a two-character TRAILER, which is usually CR and LF.  
			</t>
			<t>
			The problem with non-transparent-framing comes from the use of a TRAILER character.
			In that, the traditional trailer character
			is not escaped within the message, which causes problems for the receiver.  
			For example, a message in the style of <xref target="RFC3164" />
			containing one or more LF characters may
			be misinterpreted as multiple messages by the receiving syslog application.
			</t>

				<t>
				The ABNF for this is shown here:

    TRAILER = LF / APP-DEFINED

    LF = %d10

    APP-DEFINED = 1*2OCTET

    SYSLOG-MSG is defined in the syslog protocol [RFC5424] and may
               also be considered to be the payload in [RFC3164]

				</t>
				<t>
				A transport receiver can assume that non-transparent-framing is used if a syslog 
				frame starts with the US-ASCII character "&lt;" (%d60).
				</t>
			</section>
			<section anchor="change" title="Method Change">
				<t>
				It has been observed in legacy implementations that the framing may change on a 
				frame-by-frame basis.  This is probably not a good idea, but it's been seen.  
				</t>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section anchor="sessionClose" title="Session Closure">
			<t>
			The SYSLOG session is closed when one of the TCP hosts decides to do so.  It then 
			initiates a local TCP session closure.  Following <xref target="RFC0793">TCP</xref> 
			it doesn't need to notify the remote TCP host of its intention to close the session, 
			nor does it accept any messages that are still in transit.
			</t>
		</section>
		</section>
		<section anchor="appst" title="Applicability Statement">
			<t>
			As per the standards track documents in the syslog series, it is recommended to use 
			the <xref target="RFC5425">TLS transport</xref> to transport syslog messages.  This 
			document is provided to document what has been seen in hopes that interoperability 
			for transporting syslog over TCP may be achieved.
			</t>
			<t>
			There are several advantages to using TCP: flow control, error recovery, and 
			reliability, to name a few.  These reasons and the ease of programming have lead 
			people to use this transmission protocol to transmit syslog.
			</t>
			<t>
			One potential disadvantage is the buffering mechanism used by TCP.  Ordinarily, TCP 
			decides when enough data has been received from the application to form a segment for 
			transmission.  This may be adjusted through timers but still, some application data 
			may wait in a buffer for a relatively long time.  Syslog data is not normally 
			time-sensitive but if this delay is a concern, the syslog transport sender may utilize 
			the PUSH Flag as described in <xref target="RFC0793" /> to have the sending TCP 
			immediately send all buffered data.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
			<t>
			This protocol makes no meaningful provisions for security.
			It lacks authentication, integrity checking, and privacy.
			It makes no provision for flow control or end-to-end
			confirmation of receipt, relying instead on the underlying
			TCP implementations to approximate these functions.
			It should not be used when the alternative <xref target="RFC5425" />
			is available.
