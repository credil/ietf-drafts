1.  Introduction

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   This document defines an optional method for extensions to the DTN
   bundle protocol [2] to store references to endpoint addresses in the
   bundle dictionary.  EIDs and the reference format are described in
   [2] section 3.5.

   The primary block of each bundle contains a "dictionary" byte array.
   The text values of the endpoint identifiers in the primary block,
   such as source and destination, are stored in the dictionary and
   references to them are stored in specific places in the primary
   block.

   DTN protocol extensions may also add endpoint identifiers to the
   dictionary and store references within their extension blocks.

   The bundle protocol agent at each node may wish to remove any
   dictionary entries for which references no longer exist and, to do
   so, must be able to locate all existing EID references in a bundle.

2.  Storage Convention

   All extension blocks use the Canonical Bundle Block Format as defined
   in the Bundle Protocol Specification.  Each is comprised of the
   following elements:

      - Block type code

      - Block processing control flags

      - Block EID reference list (optional)

      - Block data length

      - Block-type-specific data fields

   The type, flags, list and length fields are common to all extension
   blocks and are known collectively as the "preamble".


   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |type       |      flags (SDNV)                 |
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |            length  (SDNV)                     |
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |  block body data                              |
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   =     (continues ... )                          =
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |  block body data                              |
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+

   EID references MUST be stored in the EID reference list

2.1.  EID Reference List

   The EID reference list is a composite field and may optionally be
   present in any extension block.  It consists of a count field
   followed by that number of references.  The count is an SDNV as
   described in [2] section 3.1.  Each reference is a ordered pair of
   SDNVs as described in [2] section 3.5, containing:

      - the offset, within the dictionary, of the first character of the
      referenced endpoint ID's scheme name

      - the offset, within the dictionary, of the first character of the
      referenced endpoint ID's SSP

   Presence of the field is indicated by the setting of bit 0x40 of the
   block processing control flags.

   If bit 0x40 is not set then there is no EID reference list field, and
   neither count nor references may appear.


   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |type       |      flags (SDNV)                 |
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |           EID reference count (SDNV)          |
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |  ref_scheme_1 (SDNV)  |    ref_ssp_1 (SDNV)   |
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |  ref_scheme_2 (SDNV)  |    ref_ssp_2 (SDNV)   |
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |            length  (SDNV)                     |
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |  block-type-specific data                     |
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   =    (continues ... )                           =
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |  block-type-specific data                     |
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+

                                 Figure 2

   Extension blocks may contain EID addresses as text within their
   block-type-specific data section.  There is no restriction on where
   or how these are stored.

   A block MUST NOT contain references in its block-type-specific data
   section

3.  Dictionary Revision

   Bundle nodes MUST support the EID reference scheme described above in
   Section 2.1.

4.  IANA Considerations

   None at this time.  If the bundle protocol becomes a standards track
   protocol, then we may want to consider having IANA establish a
   register of block types, and in particular for this specification a
   separate register of block formats.
