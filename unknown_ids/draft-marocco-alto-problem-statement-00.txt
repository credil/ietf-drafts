Abstract

   A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated by
   peer-to-peer applications used for file sharing, realtime
   communications and live media streaming.  Such applications often
   deal with large amounts of data in direct peer-to-peer connections,
   but they usually have little knowledge of the underlying topology,
   both at the overlay layer and the network layer.  As a result, they
   may choose their peers based on measurements and statistics which, in
   some specific situations, often lead to suboptimal choices.  This
   document describes problems related to optimizing traffic generated
   by peer-to-peer applications through the use of link and network
   layer information.

1.  Introduction

   A significant part of the Internet traffic is today generated by
   peer-to-peer (P2P) applications used for file sharing, realtime
   communications and live media streaming [WWW.cachelogic.picture]
   [WWW.wired.fuel].  Contrary to client/server architectures, P2P
   applications access resources (e.g. files or media relays)
   distributed across the Internet and exchange large amounts of data in
   connections that they establish directly with nodes hosting such
   resources.

   One of the advantages of P2P systems comes from the fact that the
   resources they offer are often made available through multiple
   instances.  Yet, applications generally ignore the topology of the
   latent overlay network and have to select among available instances
   based on information they deduce from empirical measurements which,
   in some particular situations, could lead to suboptimal choices.

      For example, popular metrics based on round trip time estimation
      perform quite badly for file sharing applications, as they tend to
      ignore bandwidth and reliability of underlying links, which have
      much more influence than delay on file transfers.

   Many of the existing overlay networks are built on top of connections
   between peers that are established regardless of the underlying
   network topology.  In addition to simply achieving suboptimal
   performance, such networks can lead to congestions and cause serious
   inefficiencies.  As shown in [ACM.fear], traffic generated by popular
   P2P applications often cross network boundaries multiple times,
   overloading links which are frequently subject to congestion
   [ACM.bottleneck].

   Recent studies [ACM.ispp2p] [WWW.p4p.overview] have shown that if
   Internet Service Providers (ISP) and network operators provide
   topology and/or bandwidth information to P2P applications, it would
   be possible to greatly increase aplication performance, reduce
   congestions and optimize the overall traffic across different
   networks.

   This document describes the problem of optimizing traffic generated
   by P2P applications using information provided by ISPs and network
   operators.  Section 2 introduces the problem and the main issues to
   keep in mind when designing a solution, while Section 3 describes
   some use cases where both P2P users and network operators would
   benefit from such a solution.

Internet-Draft           ALTO Problem Statement               April 2008


1.1.  Research or Engineering?

   At the time of writing, several solutions have been proposed to
   address the problem described in this document, both inside and
   outside the IETF [I-D.bonaventure-informed-path-selection]
   [ACM.ispp2p] [WWW.p4p.overview], all accompained by encouraging
   simulation and field test results.  Such solutions have been proposed
   independently, but all consists of two essential parts:
   o  a discovery mechanism which can be used by a P2P application to
      find a reliable information source;
   o  a protocol used by P2P applications to query such sources in order
      to retrieve the information needed to choose the best endpoint
      among those which host a desired resource.

   It is not easy to foresee how such solutions would perform in the
   Internet, but a more accurate evaluation would require representative
   data collected from real systems by a critical mass of users.

   However, wide adoption will probably never happen without an
   agreement on a common solution based on open standards; whether such
   a solution should be still studied as a research problem, published
   as a "Proposed Standard" or an "Experimental" RFC [RFC2026] is an
   open issue.


2.  The Problem

   Network engineers have been facing the problem of traffic
   optimization for a long time now and have already designed mechanisms
   like MPLS [RFC3031] and DiffServ [RFC3260] to deal with it.  The
   problem they address consists in finding (or setting) an optimal
   route for packets travelling between specific source and destination
   addresses and based on requirements such as low latency, high
   reliability, and priority.  Such solutions are usually implemented at
   the link and network layers, and tend to be almost transparent.
   Applications only need to "mark" the traffic they generate with the
   corresponding properties.

   However, P2P applications which are today posing serious challenges
   to Internet infrastructures, do not benefit much from the above
   techniques and "cooperating" with network operators could greatly
   optimize the traffic they generate.  In fact, when a P2P application
   needs to establish a connection, the logical target is not a host,
   but rather a resource (e.g. a file or a media relay) generally
   available in multiple instances on different hosts; selection of the
   closest one -- or, in general, the best from an overlay topological
   proximity -- has much more impact on the overall traffic than the
   route followed by its packets to reach the endpoint.

Internet-Draft           ALTO Problem Statement               April 2008


   Addressing the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) problem
   means, on the one hand, providing topology information regarding the
   underlying network and, on the other hand, enhancing P2P applications
   in order to use such information to select the best endpoints among
   those that are available for the connections they are going to
   establish.

2.1.  Issues

2.1.1.  Information Distribution

   As a direct consequence of the total distribution of the Internet, it
   seems almost impossible to centralize all information P2P
   applications may need to optimize traffic they generate.  It is quite
   likely that such information would be distributed at an ISP or domain
   level.  It is also reasonable to expect that these same network
   administrators will control provision of such information.

   However, as applications usually have no knowledge of the
   administrative entities running the network they are using, any
   solution will need to define a discovery mechanism (e.g. based on or
   similar to reverse DNS [RFC2317]) and perhaps an authority to certify
   information sources.

2.1.2.  Topology Hiding

   Operators generally consider topology of the networks they control to
   be confidential information; therefore, in order to succeed and
   achieve wide adoption, any solution will need to help P2P
   applications to always choose best peers without explicitly
   disclosing topology of the underlying network.


3.  Use Cases

3.1.  File sharing

   File sharing applications allow users to search for content shared by
   other users and download it.  Typically, search results consist of
   many istances of the same file available from multiple sources; the
   goal of an ALTO solution would be to help peers find the best ones
   according to the underlying networks.

   On the application side, integration of ALTO functionalities may
   happen at different levels.  For example, while in the completely
   decentralized Gnutella network selection of the best sources is
   totally up to the user, in systems like BitTorrent and eDonkey,
   central elements (i.e. trackers or servers) act as mediators.



Marocco & Gurbani       Expires October 17, 2008                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           ALTO Problem Statement               April 2008


   Therefore, in the former case, optimization would require
   modification in the applications, while in the latter it could just
   be implemented in some central elements.

3.2.  Live media streaming

   P2P applications for live streaming allow users to receive multimedia
   content produced by one source and targeted to multiple destinations,
   in a realtime or near-realtime way without recurring to multicast.
   Such applications tipically participate in the distribution of the
   content, acting as both receivers and senders; the goal of an ALTO
   sulution would be to help peers to find the best sources and the best
   destinations for media flows they receive and relay.

3.3.  Realtime communications

   P2P realtime communications allow users to establish direct media
   flows, usually to place audio and video calls, or to have text chats.
   In the basic case, media would flow directly between the two
   endpoints; however, in the general case, a significant portion of
   communications between users with limited access to the Internet
   (e.g. users behind NATs, firewalls or HTTP proxies) need to be
   relayed by other elements.  Such media relays are distributed over
   the Internet -- in some cases co-located with applications with a
   public address; the goal of an ALTO solution would be to help peers
   to find the best relays.

3.4.  Distributed Hash Tables

   Distributed hash tables (DHT) are a class of overlay algorithms used
   to implement lookup functionalities in popular P2P systems, without
   recurring to centralized elements.  In such systems, peers maintain
   addresses of other peers participating in the same DHT in a routing
   table, sorted according to specific criteria.  An ALTO solution would
   provide valuable information for DHT algorithms which, in order to
   reduce path latency of distributed queries, include round trip time
   estimations among such criteria [SIGCOMM.resprox].


4.  Security Considerations

   The approach proposed in this document requires P2P applications to
   delegate a portion of their routing capability to network operators,
   giving them a significant role in systems that they often view
   unfavorably.

   It is conceivable that the P2P network would consider operator
   intervention to be hostile because the operator could, for example:

Internet-Draft           ALTO Problem Statement               April 2008


   o  redirect applications to corrupted mediators providing malicious
      content;
   o  track connections to perform content inspection;
   o  apply policies based on criteria other than network efficiency
      (for example, to avoid peering points regulated by inconvenient
      economic agreements).

   However, ALTO is completely optional for P2P applications and its
   purpose is to help improve performance of such applications.  If, for
   some reason, it fails to achieve this purpose, it would simply fail
   to gain popularity and would not be used.

   Even in cases where providers would decide to maliciously alter
   results returned by ALTO queries only after the solution has gained
   popularity (i.e. they behave for a while until it becomes popular and
   then they start misbehaving), it would be fairly easy for P2P
   application maintainers and users to revert to solutions that are not
   using it.  After all, it would all come down to change some
   application settings in cases where the protocol is implemented
   inside the client and upgrading centralized elements for
   architectures like BitTorrent and eDonkey.
