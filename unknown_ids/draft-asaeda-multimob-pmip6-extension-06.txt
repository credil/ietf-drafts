Abstract

   This document describes Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) extensions to
   support IP multicast.  The Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and the Local
   Mobility Anchor (LMA) are the mobility entities defined in the PMIPv6
   protocol and act as PIM-SM routers.  The proposed protocol extension
   addresses the tunnel convergence problem and provides seamless
   handover.  This document defines the Proxy Binding Update and the
   Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages with multicast extension.

1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [2] enables network-based mobility for
   IPv6 mobile nodes (MNs) that do not implement any mobility protocols.
   The Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) is the topological anchor point to
   manages the mobile node's binding state.  The Mobile Access Gateway
   (MAG) is an access router or gateway that manages the mobility-
   related signaling for an MN.  An MN is attached to the Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 Domain (PMIPv6-Domain) that includes LMA and MAG(s), and is able
   to receive data coming from outside of the PMIPv6-Domain through LMA
   and MAG.

   Network-based mobility support for unicast is addressed in [2], while
   multicast support in PMIPv6 is not discussed in it.  Since LMA and
   MAG set up a bi-directional IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel for each mobile node
   and forwards all mobile node's traffic according to [2], it highly
   wastes network resources when a large number of mobile nodes join/
   subscribe the same multicast sessions/channels, because independent
   data copies of the same multicast packet are delivered to the
   subscriber nodes in a unicast manner through MAG.

   The base solution described in [12] provides options for deploying
   multicast listener functions in PMIPv6-Domains without modifying
   mobility and multicast protocol standards.  However, in this
   specification, MAG MUST act as an MLD proxy and hence MUST dedicate a
   tunnel link between LMA and MAG to an upstream interface for all
   multicast traffic.  This limitation does not allow to use PIM-SM
   native routing on MAG, and hence does not solve the tunnel
   convergence problem; MAG receives the same data from multiple LMAs
   when MAG attaches to them for mobile nodes and has subscribed the
   same multicast channel to them.  It does not enable local routing and
   does not support source mobility.  Furthermore, although it would be
   able to minimize the join latency for mobile nodes attached to a new
   network by tuning the Startup Query Interval value for the new MAG as
   proposed in [18], the base solution does not provide any seamless
   handover mechanism with a context transfer function.

   This document describes PMIPv6 extensions to support IP multicast
   communication for mobile nodes in PMIPv6-Domain.  The proposed
   protocol extension assumes that both LMA and MAG enable the Protocol-
   Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) multicast routing
   protocol [3].  The proposed extension uses a dedicated GRE [8] tunnel
   for multicast, called M-Tunnel, between LMA and MAG.  The proposed
   extension supports seamless handover.  It can cooperate with local
   routing to deliver IP multicast packets for mobile nodes and source
   mobility.  In this document, because multicast listener mobility is
   mainly focused on, the detail specification of source mobility is not
   described.

   The PMIPv6 extension proposed in this document does not require to
   change unicast communication methods or protocols defined in [2], and
   therefore both unicast and multicast communications for mobile nodes
   in PMIPv6-Domain are enabled if this extension is implemented.

3.  Overview

3.1.  Multicast Communication in PMIPv6

   Required components to enable IP multicast are multicast routing
   protocols and host-and-router communication protocols.  This document
   assumes PIM-SM [3] as the multicast routing protocol and MLDv2 [4] or
   LW-MLDv2 [5] as the host-and-router communication protocol.

   The architecture of a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain is shown in Figure 1.
   LMA and MAG are the core functional entities in PMIPv6-Domain.  The
   entire PMIPv6-Domain appears as a single link from the perspective of
   each mobile node.

   When a mobile node wants to subscribe/unsubscribe a multicast
   channel, it sends MLD Report messages specifying sender and multicast
   addresses to the access link.  The attached MAG detects this
   membership information and sends the PIM Join/Prune message to the
   corresponding LMA over a multicast tunnel (M-Tunnel described in
   Section 4) when the LMA is selected as the previous-hop router for
   the multicast channel, or sends the PIM Join/Prune message to the
   adjacent upstream multicast router for the multicast channel.  When
   the LMA or the adjacent router receives the PIM Join/Prune message,
   it coordinates the corresponding multicast routing tree if necessary
   and starts forwarding the data.

   When the MAG detects mobile node's handover, it can proceed the
   seamless handover procedures.  Since both PMIPv6 and multicast
   protocols (i.e., MLD and PIM-SM) do not have functions for multicast
   context transfer in their original protocol specifications, the
   external functions or protocols should be used for handover.  One of
   the possibile ways is the use of "mobile node's Policy Profile", as
   it could include "multicast channel information", which expresses
   mobile node's subscribing multicast channel list, as well as the
   mandatory fields of the Policy Profile specified in [2].  Mobile
   node's Policy Profile is provided by "policy store" whose definition
   is the same as of [2].  The Context Transfer Protocol (CXTP) [16]
   allows to minimize service disruption during handover.  "CXTP
   extension for multicast" described in [11] is therefore alternative
   way that facilitates transferring multicast state specified in
   "Multicast-Context Transfer Data (M-CTD)" from previously attached
   MAG (p-MAG) to newly attached MAG (n-MAG).

3.2.  Protocol Sequence for Multicast Channel Subscription

   A mobile node sends unsolicited MLD Report messages including source
   and multicast addresses when it subscribes a multicast channel.
   Although MLDv2 specification [4] permits to use the unspecified
   address (::) for a host whose interface has not acquired a valid
   link-local address yet, MAG SHOULD send MLDv2 Report messages with a
   valid IPv6 link-local source address as defined in [18].  As well,
   MLDv2 Report messages MAY be sent with an IP destination address of
   FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:16, to which all MLDv2-capable multicast routers
   listen, but the IP unicast address of the attached MAG SHALL be used
   for the destination of MLDv2 Report messages.

   When the MAG operating as a PIM-SM router receives MLD Report
   messages from attached mobile nodes, it joins the multicast delivery
   tree by sending PIM Join messages to its neighboring routers
   (Figure 2).  When the upstream router for the requested channel is
   LMA, the MAG sends the corresponding PIM Join messages over the
   M-Tunnel (described in Section 4), if the MAG has no multicast state



Asaeda, et al.          Expires January 13, 2012                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       PMIPv6 Extensions for Multicast           July 2011


   for the requested channel.  When the upstream router for the
   requested channel is an adjacent router that is not the LMA, the MAG
   sends the corresponding PIM Join messages to the adjacent upstream
   router natively, if the MAG has no multicast state for the requested
   channel.  The LMA or the adjacent upstream router then joins the
   multicast delivery tree and forwards the packets to the downstream
   MAG.

                Figure 2: MLD Report Messages Transmission

   The MAG selects only one upstream link for a multicast channel by the
   Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) algorithm even if the MAG has
   established multiple M-Tunnels to LMAs.  This does not cause the
   tunnel convergence problem, because duplicate packets are not
   forwarded to the MAG.

4.  Multicast Tunnel (M-Tunnel)

   M-Tunnel is a bi-directional GRE tunnel [8] dedicated for MLD message
   and IP multicast data transmissions between LMA and MAG as shown in
   Figure 3.

                   MC: Multicast packets, ==>: M-Tunnel

         Figure 3: Multicast channel subscription through M-Tunnel

   The format of the tunneled multicast packet forwarded from LMA is
   shown below.  "S" and "G" are the same notation used for (S,G)
   multicast channel.

     IPv6 header (src= LMAA, dst= Proxy-CoA) /* Outer Header */
        GRE header                           /* Encapsulation Header */
           IPv6 header (src= S, dst= G)      /* Inner Header */
              Upper layer protocols          /* Packet Content */

         Figure 4: Tunneled IPv6 multicast packet from LMA to MAG

   When an MLD message is sent from MAG to LMA, the src and dst
   addresses of tunnel header will be replaced to Proxy-CoA and LMAA,
   respectively.  To convey an MLD message, the src address of the
   packet header is changed to either LMA's or MAG's link-local address
   and the dst address of the packet header is assigned based on the
   MLD's condition.  (See Section 5.1.15 and 5.2.14 of [4].)

   M-Tunnel is established between PIM-SM capable LMA and MAG.  It is
   established in a bootstrap phase of MAG (without detecting a
   multicast channel subscription request from a mobile node) and kept
   while the MAG is running.  M-Tunnel is not per mobile node basis, but
   per MAG basis; it is shared with all mobile nodes attached to the
   MAG.

   In order to distinguish tunneled unicast traffic and multicast
   traffic, LMA and MAG need to negotiate GRE encapsulation and GRE keys
   for M-Tunnel.  The GRE Key option to be used for the negotiation of
   GRE tunnel encapsulation mode and exchange of the uplink and downlink
   GRE keys is defined in [9].  It is also possible to use the static
   fixed GRE keys for M-Tunnel.  There can be multiple LMAs in a PMIPv6-
   Domain each serving a different group of mobile nodes.  In that case,
   the MAG will connect to multiple LMAs with different M-Tunnels

5.  Local Mobility Anchor Operation

   The LMA is responsible for maintaining the mobile node's reachability
   state and is the topological anchor point for the mobile node's home
   network prefix(es).  This document assumes that the LMA is capable of
   forwarding multicast packets to the MAG by enabling the Protocol-
   Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) multicast routing
   protocol [3].  The LMA acting as a PIM-SM [3] multicast router may
   serve MAGs as downstream routers for some multicast channels when a
   mobile node is a multicast data receiver (or as upstream routers when
   a mobile node is a multicast data sender).  The downstream (or
   upstream) MAG is connected to the LMA through an M-Tunnel for
   multicast communication.

   When the LMA sets up the multicast state and joins the group as the
   MAG's upstream router, the multicast packets are tunneled to the MAG
   that requested to receive the corresponding multicast session.  The
   MAG then forwards the packets to the mobile node according to the
   multicast listener state maintained in the MAG. [2] supports only
   point-to-point access link types for MAG and mobile node connection;
   hence a mobile node and the MAG are the only two nodes on an access
   link, where the link is assumed to be multicast capable.

6.  Mobile Access Gateway Operation

   The MAG is the entity that performs the mobility management on behalf
   of a mobile node.  This document assumes that MAG is capable of
   forwarding multicast packets to the corresponding mobile nodes
   attached to MAG by enabling the PIM-SM multicast routing protocol.
   In addition, MAG must maintain multicast membership status for the
   attached mobile nodes at the edge and forwards the multicast data to
   the member mobile nodes.  This condition requires MAG to support
   MLDv2 [4] or LW-MLDv2 [5], as well.

   When mobile nodes subscribe multicast channel(s), they send MLD
   Report messages with their link-local address to the MAG, and the MAG
   sends the corresponding PIM Join messages to the upstream router if
   the MAG has no multicast state for the requested channel(s).  The
   upstream router is selected by the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF)
   lookup algorithm, and that is either LMA or an adjacent multicast
   router attached to the same link.  If the LMA is the upstream router
   for the channel(s) for the MAG, the MAG encapsulates PIM Join
   messages using M-Tunnel.

   The MAG also sends MLD Query messages to attached mobile nodes to
   maintain up-to-date membership states.  Since the MAG may deal with a
   large number of the downstream mobile nodes, the MLD protocol
   scalability should be taken into account as described in [18].

7.  Mobile Node Operation

   Mobile nodes attached to MAG can behave as regular receiver hosts.  A
   mobile node sends MLD messages to MAG when it wants to subscribe and
   unsubscribe IP multicast channels.

   In order to subscribe/unsubscribe multicast channel(s) by unsolicited
   report messages and inform current membersip state by solicited
   report messages, mobile nodes MUST support either MLDv1 [4], MLDv2
   [4], or LW-MLDv2 [5], and SHOULD support MLDv2 or LW-MLDv2.

8.  Smooth Handover

   MAG is responsible for detecting the mobile node's movements to and
   from the access link and for initiating binding registrations to the
   mobile node's LMA.  MAG tracks the mobile node's movements to and
   from the access link and for signaling the mobile node's LMA.  In
   PMIPv6, it SHOULD NOT require for mobile nodes to initiate to re-
   subscribe multicast channels, and MAG SHOULD keep multicast channel
   subscription status for mobile nodes even if they move to a different
   MAG (i.e., n-MAG) in PMIPv6-Domain.

   MAG needs to join the multicast delivery tree when an attached mobile
   node subscribes a multicast channel.  When the mobile node changes
   the network, it should seamlessly receive multicast data from the new
   MAG according to the multicast channel information stored in the
   "MN's Policy Profile" or by the "multicast context transfer
   mechanism".  Whether the MN's Policy Profile or the multicast context
   transfer mechanism mobile operators use depend on their policy or
   implementation.

8.1.  Handover with Policy Profile

   When the multicast channel information subscribed by mobile nodes is
   maintained in "MN's Policy Profile" stored in a policy store [2], MAG
   can use the channel information to provide seamless handover.  The
   procedures are described as follows and illustrated in Figure 5;

   1.   Figure 5 shows the examples that a mobile node has received
        multicast data from an upstream multicast router via p-MAG (*1)
        and from LMA via p-MAG (*2).

   2.   Whenever the mobile node moves a new network and attaches to
        n-MAG, the n-MAG obtains the MN-Identifier (MN-ID) and learns
        multicast channel information described in Mobile Node's Policy
        Profile associated to this MN-Identifier.  Describing the method
        how the n-MAG identifies the p-MAG is out of scope of this
        document, while using the same mechanism described in [17] would
        be one of the possible methods.

   3.   If there are multicast channels the mobile node has subscribed
        but the n-MAG has not yet subscribed, n-MAG joins the
        corresponding multicast channels by sending the PIM Join message
        to its upstream router.  If the upstream router is LMA, the PIM
        messages are encapsulated and transmitted over M-Tunnel (*4);
        otherwise the PIM messages are sent natively (*3).

   4.   The multicast data is forwarded from LMA through an M-Tunnel
        between the LMA and n-MAG (*4) or from the adjacent upstream
        router (*3).

                Figure 5: Handover with MN's Policy Profile

   After MN attaches to n-MAG, the multicast data will be delivered to
   the MN immediately.  MN's multicast membership state is maintained
   with MLD Query and Report messages exchanged by MN and n-MAG.  If
   p-MAG thinks that the moving mobile node is the last member of
   multicast channel(s), p-MAG confirms it by sending IGMP/MLD query.

   After the confirmation, p-MAG leaves the channel(s) by sending the
   PIM Prune message to its upstream router.

8.2.  Handover with Extended Proxy Binding Update and Acknowledgement

   This document provides the multicast extension for the PBU message,
   which is named "Proxy Binding Update with multicast extension
   (PBU-M)" (detailed in Section 9.1), and the PBA message, which is
   named "Proxy Binding Acknowledge with multicast extension (PBA-M)"
   (detailed in Section 9.2), to inform n-MAG to subscribe multicast
   channel(s) for moving mobile nodes.

   1.   Figure 6 shows the examples that a mobile node has received
        multicast data from an upstream multicast router via p-MAG (*1)
        and from LMA via p-MAG (*2).

   2.   Whenever the mobile node moves a new network, the p-MAG sends
        de-registration PBU-M message having the lifetime value of zero
        (see Section 9.1) to the LMA.  The LMA then transmits the PBA
        message and keeps the multicast channel information included in
        that message.

   3.   When the mobile node attaches to n-MAG, the n-MAG obtains the
        MN-Identifier (MN-ID) and transmits the regular PBU message.

   4.   Whenever the LMA receives the PBU message, it transmits the
        PBA-M message including multicast channel information that the
        mobile node has joined.

   5.   If there are multicast channels in the channel information the
        mobile node has subscribed but the n-MAG has not yet subscribed,
        the n-MAG joins the corresponding multicast channels by sending
        the PIM Join message to its upstream router.

   6.   Follow the procedures of step 3 and 4 in Section 8.1.

      Figure 7: Proxy Binding Update Message with Multicast Extension

   A Binding Update message that is sent by MAG to LMA is referred to as
   the "Proxy Binding Update" message.  A new flag (C) is included in
   the Proxy Binding Update message with Multicast extension (PBU-M).
   The rest of the Binding Update message format remains the same as
   defined in [13] and with the additional (R), (M), and (P) flags, as
   specified in [14], [15], and [2], respectively.

      Multicast Channel Subscription Flag

      A new flag (C) is included in the Binding Update message to
      indicate to LMA that the Binding Update message is a multicast
      channel subscription.

   The PBU-M message is transfered for binding de-registration from
   p-MAG to LMA as apecified in Section 8.2, the Lifetime value MUST be
   zero.

   When (C) flag is specified in PBU-M message, the mobility options
   field includes "multicast channel information", which is the same
   information of MLDv2 Report message, where the fields contain data
   with the same definitions in [4].

                  Figure 10: PBA with Multicast Extension

   A "Proxy Binding Acknowledgement" message is sent from LMA to MAG in
   response to a Proxy Binding Update message.  A new flag (C) is
   included in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message with Multicast
   extension (PBA-M).  The rest of the Binding Acknowledgement message
   format remains the same as defined in [13] and with the additional
   (R) flag, as specified in [14] and [2], respectively.

      Multicast Channel Subscription Flag

      A new flag (C) is included in the Binding Acknowledgement message
      to indicate to MAG that the Binding Acknowledgement message is a
      multicast channel subscription.

   When (C) flag is specified in PBA-M message, the mobility options
   field includes "multicast channel information", which is the same
   information of MLDv2 Report message [4] as described in Section 9.1.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates a new registry for the flags in the Binding
   Update message called the "Binding Update Flags".

   The following flags are reserved:

         (A) 0x8000 [RFC3775]

         (H) 0x4000 [RFC3775]

         (L) 0x2000 [RFC3775]

         (K) 0x1000 [RFC3775]

         (M) 0x0800 [RFC4140]

         (R) 0x0400 [RFC3963]

         (P) 0x0200 [RFC5213]

   This document reserves a new flag (C) for "Proxy Binding Update with
   Multicast Extension" as described in Section 9.1 as follows:

         (C) 0x0100

   The rest of the values in the 16-bit field are reserved.  New values
   can be assigned by Standards Action or IESG approval.

   This document also creates a new registry for the flags in the
   Binding Acknowledgment message called the "Binding Acknowledgment
   Flags".

   The following flags are reserved:

         (K) 0x80 [RFC3775]

         (R) 0x40 [RFC3963]

         (P) 0x20 [RFC5213]

   This document reserves a new flag (C) for "Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement with Multicast Extension" as described in Section 9.2
   as follows:

         (C) 0x010

   The rest of the values in the 8-bit field are reserved.  New values
