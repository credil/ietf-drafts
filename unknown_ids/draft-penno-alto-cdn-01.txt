                   ALTO and Content Delivery Networks
                        draft-penno-alto-cdn-01

Abstract

   Networking applications can request through the ALTO protocol
   information about the underlying network topology from the ISP or
   Content Provider (henceforth referred as Provider) point of view.  In
   other words, what a Provider prefers in terms of traffic optimization
   -- and a way to distribute it.  The ALTO Service provides information
   such as preferences of network resources with the goal of modifying
   network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving
   application performance.

   A main use case of the ALTO Service is its integration with of
   Content Delivery Networks (CDN).  In this document we describe the
   deployment scenarios and considerations for a ALTO Service in the
   case of CDNs.

1.  Introduction

   Content Delivery Networks are becoming increasingly important in the
   Internet [ARBOR] and many CDNs today already use some form of
   proximity through geolocation.  But in many cases the content
   provider/distributor and the Internet Service Provider are disjoint
   and even if content servers are co-located into the ISP's networks,
   there is no standardized way to share information.  Therefore a
   natural step forward would be to use ALTO to share information.

   Another key aspect of ALTO in the context of CDNs deployments is that
   it is desirable that no changes to the hosts are needed (or would be
   transparent to the user).  In other words, a traditional web browser
   is all there is needed to take advantage of ALTO information.  This
   is a significant difference from the P2P applications where a special
   client is typically needed and ALTO is normally used as a way to
   reduce operational expense.


2.  Scope

   This document discusses how Content Delivery Networks can benefit
   from ALTO through integration of the ALTO Service with the main
   request routing techniques.  Whenever a gap in protocol functionality
   is identified to achieve such integration, it will be enumerated with
   'GAP-<N>'.  Each gap is documented in a section of its own in order
   to foster parallel discussions and possible adoption.


3.  Terminology

      Content-aware Proximity Redirector: The Redirector knows about
      locations and presence of content & media objects in the network.
      Therefore the redirection to a CDN node is made based on
      availability of content or content-type in that CDN node and the
      proximity of the CDN node to the user.

      Service-aware Proximity Redirector: The Redirector knows about
      locations of CDN nodes in the network and redirects user to the
      closest CDN node.  A redirection is made irrespective of content
      presence in the CDN node; if content is not present, the node will
      be populated with the content before or when the content is served
      to the user.

      HTTP Redirector: a Content-aware or Service-aware Proximity
      Redirector for HTTP.  It embeds an HTTP Server that performs HTTP
      Redirects, an ALTO client that retrieves network mapping from the
      ALTO Server and a Location Database which stores network mappings

      received from the ALTO Client.  The HTTP Server consults the
      Location Database when making redirection decisions.


4.  Content Location Selection

   There are multiple mechanisms that ISPs and CDNs can use to select
   the location from which content is served to a particular host, where
   information from one or more ALTO Servers can be used to improve or
   optimize the selection.  In particular, two commonly used location
   selection mechanisms are HTTP Redirect and DNS name resolution.
   Thus, we focus on these two mechanisms.

4.1.  HTTP Redirect

   In this case an HTTP GET request from a host is received by an HTTP
   Redirector which sends back an HTTP responses with Status-Code 302
   (Redirect) informing the host of the most optimal location to fetch
   the content.  The HTTP Redirection method is already commonly used in
   production CDNs as described in RFC3568 [RFC3568].  ALTO integration
   provides localization services where the device that performs the
   redirection becomes an ALTO client.

   Usage of the ALTO Server with HTTP Redirects is shown in the
   following figure.  Either the Map Service or the Endpoint Cost
   Service can be used by the ALTO client embedded in the HTTP
   Redirector entity.

4.1.1.  The Map Service

   The ALTO client embedded in the HTTP Redirector fetches the Network
   and Cost Maps from the ALTO Server and provides that information to
   the HTTP Redirector.  As an illustrative example, a simple Redirector
   may be given (from an external source) the list of available CDN
   nodes.  The Redirector precomputes a redirection table indexed by
   source PID with values being the closest CDN nodes.  This redirection
   table can be built based on information from Network and Cost Maps.
   Then when it receives an HTTP GET request (1), it looks up the PID of
   the source IP address on the GET request, indexes the redirection
   table using the request PID to select a CDN node, and finally returns
   an HTTP redirect with the URL of the selected CDN node.  In practice,
   the redirection table may be indexed by both source and content to
   provide better redirection.

   The URL in 302 Redirect may contain the IP address of the selected
   CDN node or a domain name instead of IP address due to virtual
   hosting.  Therefore the IP addresses contained in the cost maps may
   need to be correlated to domain names a priori.

   The Network Maps generated by the ALTO server contain Host PIDs and
   CDN Node PIDs, i.e., Host PIDs contain host subnets; CDN PIDs contain
   IP addresses of available CDN nodes.  Cost Maps contain only cost
   from each host PID to each CDN PID and not the full matrix across all
   PIDs.  The reason is that the HTTP Redirector can only redirect a
   host to a CDN node, not to another host as in the P2P case.
   Moreover, there is no generic way to disambiguate PIDs containing
   only hosts from PIDs containing CDN nodes (GAP).

   The cost for CDN PID to CDN PID and between host PIDs are assumed to
   be infinity (GAP).  The HTTP Redirector looks up the source address
   on the HTTP GET request, and uses the cost map to select the best CDN
   PID and a CDN node from it.  The CDN node selection method can be
   random, round-robin, or the HTTP Redirector can use some level of
   content awareness (i.e. send requests for the same content (URL) to
   the same CDN node.

      GAP-1 (PID Attributes): In order to disambiguate between PIDs that
      contain endpoints of a specific class, a PID property is needed.
      A PID can be classified as containing "CDN nodes", "Mobile Hosts",
      "Wireline Hosts", etc.  Note that the Alto Server will have to be
      told which subnets belong to hosts and which subnets belong to CDN
      Nodes.

      GAP-2 (PID Attributes and Query): PID attributes can be used by
      the ALTO Client to select an appropriate CDN Node and also passed
      as a constraint in the map filtering service.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title                  July 2010


      GAP-3 (Default Cost): The issue of default cost is one of
      importance.  Without a default PID with endpoint '0.0.0.0/0', what
      should be the cost between two PIDs?  Moreover, is the default PID
      mandatory in the protocol?

4.1.2.  The Endpoint Cost Service

   Alternatively, ALTO client embedded in the HTTP Redirector, requests
   the endpoint cost service from the ALTO client.

   The Redirector knows the IP address of the user (content requester)
   and the different content locations.  It then requests the Endpoint
   Cost Service in order to rank/rate the content locations (i.e., IP
   addresses of CDN nodes) based on their distance/cost (by default the
   Endpoint Cost Service operates based on Routing Distance) from/to the
   user address.

   Note that the mechanisms through which the CDN acquires the IP
   addresses of the content locations (i.e.: how to locate the requested
   content) are part of the CDN implementation and their description is
   outside the scope of this document.

   Once the Redirector obtained from the ALTO server the ranked list of
   locations (for the specific user) it can incorporate this information
   into its selection mechanisms in order to point the user to the most
   appropriate location.

4.1.3.  CDN Node Discovery and Status

   The method of discovering available caches and their locations is
   outside the scope of this document.  We assume the CDN nodes are
   discovered in some way.  It is desirable that not only CDN node
   locations, but also real-time status (like health, load, cache
   utilization, CPU, etc.) is communicated either to the HTTP Redirector
   or to the ALTO Server.

   CDN node status can be retrieved from the existing Load Balancer
   infrastructure.  Most Load Balancers today have mechanisms to poll
   caches/servers via ping, HTTP Get, traceroute, etc.  Most LBs have
   SNMP trap capabilities to let other devices know about these
   thresholds.  The HTTP Redirector or the ALTO Server can implement an
   SNMP agent and get to know whatever is needed.  For greenfield
   installations, the ALTO Server could also provide an API (for
   example, a Web Service or XMPP-based API) that could be used by CDN
   nodes to communicate their status to the ALTO server directly.

   In addition to the CDN node status, network status can also be
   retrieved from TE/RP databases.

   In this use case the HTTP Redirector receives CDN Status updates.

4.1.3.2.  CDN Node Status Updates received by ALTO Server

   This model generally simplifies the HTTP Redirector.  It allows an
   easier distribution of the HTTP Redirector, and to keep real time CDN
   status data updates in a logically centralized ALTO Server or in an
   ALTO Server Cluster.  It allows for the HTTP Redirector and the ALTO
   Server to be in different administrative domains.  For example, the
   HTTP Redirector can be in a Content Provider's domain, the ALTO
   Server and CDN Nodes in a Network Service Provider's domain.

                  Figure 3: RT CDN Updates to ALTO Server

   In this model it is recommended that a given HTTP Redirector may be
   designated as being responsible for a fixed set of Host PIDs.  This
   information can be made available to the HTTP Redirector before it
   receives requests from hosts.  If the set of Host PIDs is not known
   ahead of time, the latency for serving requests will be impacted by
   the capabilities of the ALTO server.

   With such information ahead of time, an HTTP Redirector that uses the
   Network Maps Service may pre-download the network map for the
   interesting Host PIDs and the CDN PIDs.  It can also start
   periodically pulling cost maps for relevant PID 2-tuples.

   An HTTP Redirector that uses the Endpoint Cost Service may query the
   ALTO Server for rankings of CDN Node IP addresses for each
   interesting Host and cache the results for later usage.

   The HTTP Redirector can rely on the ALTO Server generated Cache-
   Control headers to decide how often to fetch CDN PID network map and
   Host PID network maps.  In order to better deal with outages of
   caches or changes to CDN PIDs, a push mechanism from ALTO server to
   ALTO client would be needed (GAP-4).  In the general P2P scenario
   this may not make sense, but with content delivery this may be
   important from a service continuity perspective.

   If the maps are large and change often a natural extension to the
   protocol is to allow incremental Map Updates (GAP-5).  This
   requirement becomes more emphasized when the ALTO Server is the

   changes are typically more frequent than topology changes in the
   network.

      GAP-4 (Push Mechanism): It is important for the ALTO Service
      through the ALTO protocol or a companion protocol to provide a
      push mechanism from server to client.  The push mechanism can be a
      notification that new data is available or the data itself.

      GAP-5 (Incremental Map Updates): A natural evolution to the
      protocol if maps are large and change often is to allow for
      incremental map updates.  In this sense the map contained in the
      reply would be considered the delta from the previous version.

4.2.  DNS Integration

   In the case of DNS request routing, the DNS server handling host
   requests is integrated with an ALTO client.  When the host performs a
   DNS query/lookup, the IP address contained in the response is already
   optimal for that query.  As in the previous example, no changes in
   the host are needed.

   DNS queries can be either iterative or recursive.  Iterative queries
   can be used with ALTO if the host itself queries the DNS Servers, or
   if the DNS Proxy used by the host is topologically close to the host.
   If the Host queries the DNS Servers, the authoritative DNS Server can
   see directly the host's IP address.  If the the DNS Proxy's is
   topologically close to the Host, its IP address is a good
   approximation for the host's location.  In recursive queries, the
   authoritative DNS Server sees the IP address of the previous DNS
   Server in the resolution chain, and the IP address of the host is
   unknown.  DNS-based request routing does not work with recursive DNS
   queries.

   In an iterative DNS lookup with DNS Proxy, as shown in examples in
   the next section, the host queries the Proxy, which in turn first
   queries one of the root servers to find the server authoritative for
   the top-level domain (com in our example).  The Proxy then queries
   the obtained top-level-domain DNS server for the address of the DNS
   server authoritative for the CDN domain.  Finally, the Proxy queries
   the DNS server that is authoritative for the cdn.com domain.  The
   authoritative DNS Server for the cdn.com will perform the request
   routing to the most appropriate CDN node, based on the source IP
   address of the requestor.  The host will then request the content
   directly from the CDN Node.

4.3.  ALTO Server Discovery


5.  Administrative domains and ALTO

   With DNS-based redirection, among others, there are two models that
   are worth further study - one, where the CDN nodes are in the
   administrative domain of the ISP and two, where CDN nodes are part of
   a separate domain from that of the ISP.  In the first use case, the
   Host, the CDN Nodes, the ALTO Server and the Authoritative DNS Server
   for the CDN domain are in the same administrative domain.  In the
   second use case, Hosts and CDN Nodes are in different administrative
   domains.

5.1.  CDN nodes in the ISP administrative domain

   When the CDN nodes are within the ISP's administrative domain, the
   DNS server with the ALTO client is under the ISP's management.  A
   best CDN nodes can be picked by performing ALTO query on the source
   IP address (and the target domain name) of the DNS request.

5.2.  CDN nodes in a separate administrative domain from that of ISP

   In many situations, the CDN nodes are in a separate network managed
   by an entity that is distinct from the ISP.  Consequently, the CDN
   nodes belong to a network with its own ALTO server that is distinct
   from the ALTO server of the ISP where the subscriber belongs.

           Figure 5: Map advertising between ISP and CDN domains

   The ALTO server in the CDN provider network is assumed to be
   initialized with information about the ISP networks it serves.  For
   every such ISP network, it consults the routing plane to find the set
   of Border routers.  The CDN network ALTO server computes the cost of
   reaching each Border router from every CDN node (say, C_cdn).

   Next, the CDN ALTO server contacts the ISP network's ALTO server and
   downloads the network map.  In order to help the CDN ALTO server
   compute the cost from a CDN node to a subscriber's PID, we break it
   down into two parts - the cost from the CDN node to the Border Router
   (C_cdn) and the cost from the Border Router to the subscriber's PID
   (say, C_isp).  Note that for any chosen exit point, C_cdn may be
   computed locally by the CDN ALTO Server.  However, the fundamental
   issue is that C_isp depends on the exit point (Border outer) chosen
   by the CDN.  There are multiple ways for the CDN ALTO Server to
   compute C_isp given the Network Map and Cost Map from the ISP's ALTO
   Server.

   One possibility is for the ISP ALTO Server to define a special Border
   Router PID (denoted by a PID attribute) which also indicates the
   corresponding Border Router PID in the CDN.  The attributes and
   values may be agreed-upon by the ISP and CDN when the ALTO Services
   are configured.  For example, in the example shown in Figure 5, the
   ISP ALTO Server indicates that its PID4 and PID5 are Border PIDs,
   with corresponding PIDs in the CDN as PID6, and PID7, respectively.
   Then, CDN ALTO Server can locally compute C_isp = cost(ISP Border
   Router PID, Subscriber PID).

   A second possibility for computing C_isp is to make use of Border
   Router IP addresses.  The CDN's Border Router can locally determine
   the IP address of the connected border router in the ISP.  In this
   approach, neither the CDN ALTO Server nor the ISP ALTO Server define
   PID attributes.  The ISP ALTO Server is not required to define
   special PIDs for Border Routers - it only needs to ensure that Border
   Router IP addresses are aggregated appropriately in its Network Map.

   Specifically, we identify two scenarios for the CDN ALTO Server to
   compute C_isp and C_cdn.

   In the first scenario, the CDN does not conduct CDN-level multi-path
   routing from the CDN nodes to the subscriber hosts.  Thus, the
   routing path from a CDN IP address to a subscriber host IP address is
   typically uniquely (if no ECMP) determined by the network routing
   system.  In this scenario, for a given CDN node IP address to a
   subscriber host IP address, the CDN ALTO Server uses the routing
   system to compute the Border Egress router inside the CDN, and the
   corresponding Border Ingress router inside the ISP.  Then the CDN
   ALTO Server has C_cdn(CDN node IP, Border Egress router IP inside the
   CDN), and C_isp(Border Ingress router IP inside the ISP, Subscriber
   IP).  The computation of C_cdn and C_isp can be done using ALTO in
   the traditional way through either the Network Map and Cost Map or
   the Endpoint Cost Service.

   In the second scenario, the CDN may support CDN-level multi-path

   routing from the CDN nodes to the subscriber hosts.  In particular,
   from each CDN node, the CDN has a capability (e.g., through
   tunneling) to send to a subscriber host IP through multiple Border
   Egress routers (e.g., through any Egress router that receives an
   announcement from the ISP of the subscriber host IP).  In this case,
   the cost of reaching a host PID from a given CDN node is then
   determined as the minimum cost among all possible intermediate Border
   Routers.

   If the network is homogeneous, then a good approximation of the cost
   between each host PID and a given CDN node can be given as: C_cdn(CDN
   Node, Border router) + C_isp(Border router, Subscriber PID).  In this
   computation, the Border Router is the one that is on the best path
   from the CDN node to the Subscriber PID.

   The CDN ALTO server now has a cost map that provides the cost from
   each CDN node to all known Subscriber PIDs.  The ALTO client in the
   CDN DNS server downloads this cost map in preparation for subscriber
   DNS requests.

   When a subscriber DNS request arrives at the CDN provider's DNS
   server, it looks up the network map and maps the source IP address to
   a Subscriber PID.  It then uses the cost map to pick the best CDN
   node for this Subscriber PID.

      GAP-6: Federation of ALTO servers: There is a need to define how
      ALTO servers may communicate with each other in a federated model.

      GAP-7: ALTO Border Router PID attribute: In order for
      administrative domains to collate costs across domain boundaries,
      the border routers may be placed in their own PIDs.  Such PIDs may
      be identified by a Border Router attribute.

5.3.  Integrating with managed DNS service

   Many organizations / content providers outsource DNS management to
   the external vendors for various reasons like reliability,
   performance improvement, DNS security etc.  Managed DNS service could
   be used either with caches owned by the organization itself (section
   6.3.1) OR with external CDNs (section 6.3.2)

5.3.1.  Managed DNS resolver used to redirect to local cache

   One of the common functions offered by managed DNS service vendor is
   DNS traffic management where DNS resolver can load balance traffic
   dynamically across content servers.

   Typically managed DNS service provider has DNS resolvers spread

   across geographical locations to improve performance.  This also
   makes easier for DNS resolver to redirect host to the nearest cache.
   Such a DNS resolver would be an ideal candidate to implement ALTO
   client where it can fetch network map and cost map from ALTO servers
   located in the same geographical area only.  Load balancing
   implemented with the knowledge of network and cost map would be more
   efficient than other mechanisms like round robin.

   In the figure above, there exists 2 possibilities:

   Case 1: Domain 1 and Domain 2 are connected to the same service
   provider network.  This case is similar to section 6.1

   Case 2: Domain 1 and Domain 2 are connected to different service
   provider network.  This case is similar to section 6.2

5.3.2.  Managed DNS resolver used with multiple CDN vendors

   In this Model, Managed DNS service can be used along with multiple
   CDN vendors where DNS resolver can redirect to different caches
   depending on the subdomain e.g.  DNS resolver could have below
   records

   subdomain1.xyz.com CNAME cdn1.com

   subdomain2.xyz.com CNAME cdn2.com

   In this case CDN DNS resolver needs to be an ALTO client.  This
   deployment will be similar to ones described in section 6.1 and
   section 6.2 earlier.


6.  Tracker Integration

   In the case of P2P CDNs, the application tracker takes the role of
   the ALTO Client, fetching the map from the ALTO Server and
   integrating it its peer database.  The result is a peer database
   taking into account current metrics such as peer availability,
   content availability and also localization.  This architecture in the
   context of file sharing was extensively studied and trialed by ISPs
   such as Comcast [RFC5632] under the P4P [P4P] protocol.

8.  Security Considerations

   When the ALTO Server and Client are operated by different entities
   the issue of trust and security comes forward.  The exchange of
   information could be done using the encryption methods already
   present in HTTP but preventing unauthorized redistribution comes into
   play.  A further issue is if the ALTO information information is
   transitive, which modifications are allowed.
