Abstract

   This document introduces a new way to return similar civic locations
   (i.e., address sets) when original input location is returned not
   valid within the findServiceResponse message.  This document defines
   a new extension to the findServiceResponse message within the LoST
   protocol [RFC5222], that enables the LoST protocol to return one or
   more suggested sets of civic location information.  This "similar"
   address information is included as compilation of ca type xml
   elements within the existing response message structure.

1.  Introduction

   The LoST protcol [RFC5222] supports the validation of civic location
   information as input, by providing a set of validation result status
   indicators.  The current usefullness of the supported xml elements,
   "valid", "invalid", and "unchecked", is limited, because while they
   each provide an indication of validity for any one element as a part
   of the whole address, the mechanism is insufficient in providing
   hints or alternate suggestions as to other close fits, or similar
   civic locations.

   As with the example below, a civic location that is input for
   validation using an incorrect street suffix will result in an invalid
   civic location.  This document provides a mechanism to provide
   additional clues, and suggestions for addresses that are very similar
   to the original.

   This enhancement to the validation within LoST is required to ensure
   a high level of address matching, to overcome user and system input
   errors, and to support the usefullness of location-based systems in
   general.

   The structure of this document includes terminology, Section 2,
   followed by a discussion of the basic elements involved in location
   validation.  These use of these elements, by way of example, is
   discussed in an overview section, Section 3, with accompanying
   rationale, and a brief discussion of the impacts to LoST, and its
   current schema.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119],
   with the important qualification that, unless otherwise stated, these
   terms apply to the design of the Location Configuration Protocol and
   the Location Dereferencing Protocol, not its implementation or
   application.

   The following terms are defined in this document:

   Address:  The term Address is used interchangeably with the concept
      of Civic Location.

   Invalid:  The result of the attempt to match an individual input data
      as part of a larger set of data that has already been successfully
      matched.

   Invalid Civic Element:  An unmatched result of an individual civic
      location element as part of a broader set of elements that make up
      a civic location.

   Invalid Civic Location:  An unmatched result of an input civic
      location, when taken as a whole, based on one or more individual
      unmatched civic address elements.

   Similar Address:  A suggested civic location that is comparitively
      close to the civic location which was input, but which had one or
      more invalid element.

3.  Overview of Location Transformation

   This section lays out an example of how similar addresses are shown
   to work.

   Suppose that someone submits this address to Lost: 6000 15th Ave
   Seattle, WA This address is deemed "invalid" because there is no
   plain "15th Ave" in the city of Seattle with a house number equal to
   6000.  However there are two addresses within the address dataset
   that are "similar", when all parts of the address are taken as a
   whole.  These similar addresses that could be suggested to the user
   are as follows: similar address #1: 6000 15th Ave NW Seattle, WA
   98107 similar address #2: 6000 15th Ave NE Seattle, WA 98105 This
   document proposes to include the above similar addresses as
   civicAddress elements in the response to locationValidation.  The
   next section shows the LoST request and response xml message fragment
   for the above example, returning the "similar" addresses:

4.  Similar Location Example in findServiceResponse

   The LoST server knows the data that is available internally, and can
   choose which type of similar addresses that it wants to return.

5.  Precedent for Similar Address Services

   There are many web-based applications that already use address
   matching to refine user input when the exact address is not known -
   or is represented in a way that is not commonly known or familiar.

   One example is a public transportation system that offers a trip
   planner application, but requires a start and end address to be able
   to determine a route.  In some cases, the seekers of the route
   information are the ones with the least familiarity with the region,
   so having the ability to obtain similar addresses would be beneficial
   to the user.

   Another example is Public Safety.  Next Generation emergency call
   architectures have founded on the IETF's ECRIT LoST protocol, which
   makes the need to assure that the call routing mechanism will work.
   LoST can take advantage of this proposal during location validation
   step, ahead of an emergency call, to assure the user (or LoST
   client), their emergency call witll route appropriately, and that
   they will have the correctly selected dispatch location used.

6.  Similar Address Input Parameters

   Additional input parameters that request the server to return a
   greater number of similar addresses, or specify the type(s) of data
   to substitute (i.e., a matching algorithm), is left as out-of-scope
   in this draft.

8.  Relax NG schema Impacts

   The above proposal is already compatible with RFC-5222 RELAX NG
   definition for the <locationValidation> element, based on the
   inclusion in the locationValidation definition of "extensionPoint",
   which allows for the inclusion of any non-LoST elements.

   The proposal does not, therefore, need to redefine the current RFC-
   5222 RELAX NG definitions, the proposal simply needs to say that when
   a LoST Server returns a <findServiceResponse> with a
   locationValidation that contains an invalid, it is recommended that
   the LoST server try to include one or more <civicAddress> in the
   <locationValidation>, where each is a fully valid address that is
   "similar" to the input address.  User-facing GUIs should present
   these "similar" addresses to help the user resolve the invalid
   address in their original request.

   The proposal does not try and define exactly how to compute "similar"
   addresses.  Lost server implementers are free to choose whatever
   technique to compute similar addresses -- any "similar" address is
   likely to be helpful for the user.
