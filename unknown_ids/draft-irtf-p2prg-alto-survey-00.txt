Abstract

   A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated by
   peer-to-peer (P2P) applications used traditionally for file-sharing,
   and more recently for real-time communications and live media
   streaming.  Such applications discover a route to each other through
   an overlay network with little knowledge of the underlying network
   topology.  As a result, they may choose peers based on information
   deduced from empirical measurements, which can lead to suboptimal
   choices.  We refer to this as the Application Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO) problem.  In this draft we present a survey of
   existing literature on discovering topology characteristics.

1.  Introduction

   A significant part of today's Internet traffic is generated by peer-
   to-peer (P2P) applications, used originally for file sharing, and
   more recently for realtime multimedia communications and live media
   streaming.  P2P applications are posing serious challenges to the
   Internet infrastructure; by some estimates, P2P systems are so
   popular that they make up anywhere between 40% to 85% of the entire
   Internet traffic [Meeker], [Karag], [Light], [Linux], [Parker],
   [Glasner].

   P2P systems ensure that popular content is replicated at multiple
   instances in the overlay.  But perhaps ironically, a peer searching
   for that content may ignore the topology of the latent overlay
   network and instead select among available instances based on
   information it deduces from empirical measurements, which, in some
   particular situations may lead to suboptimal choices.  For example, a
   shorter round-trip time estimation is not indicative of the bandwidth
   and reliability of the underlying links, which have more of an
   influence than delay for large file transfer P2P applications.

   Most distributed hash tables (DHT) -- the data structure that imposes
   a specific ordering for P2P overlays -- use greedy forwarding
   algorithms to reach their destination, making locally optimal
   decisions that may not turn to be globally optimized [Gummadi-1].
   This naturally leads to the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
   (ALTO) problem [I-D.ietf-alto-problem-statement]: how to best provide
   the topology of the underlying network while at the same time
   allowing the requesting node to use such information to effectively
   reach the node on which the content resides.  Thus, it would appear
   that P2P networks with their application layer routing strategies
   based on overlay topologies are in direct competition against the
   Internet routing and topology.

   One way to solve the ALTO problem is to build distributed
   application-level services for location and path selection
   [Francis-1], [Ng-1], [Dabek-1], [Costa-1], [Wong-1], [Madhyastha-1],
   in order to enable peers to estimate their position in the network
   and to efficiently select their neighbors.  Similar solutions have
   been embedded into P2P applications such as Azureus [Azureus].  A
   slightly different approach is to have the Internet service provider
   (ISP) take a pro-active role in the routing of P2P application
   traffic; the means by which this can be achieved have been proposed
   [Aggarwal-1], [Xie-1], [I-D.saucez-idips].  There is an intrinsic
   struggle between the layers -- P2P overlay and network underlay --
   when performing the same service (routing), however there are
   strategies to mitigate this dichotomy [Seetharaman-1].

2.  Survey of Existing Literature

   Gummadi et al.  [Gummadi-1] compare popular DHT algorithms and
   besides analyzing their resilience, provide an accurate evaluation of
   how well the logical overlay topology maps on the physical network
   layer.  In their paper, relying only on measurements independently
   performed by overlay nodes without the support of additional location
   information provided by external entities, they demonstrate that the
   most efficient algorithms in terms of resilience and proximity
   performance are those based on the simplest geometric concept (i.e.
   the ring geometry, rather than hypercubes, tree structures and
   butterfly networks).

   Regardless of the geometrical properties of the distributed data
   structures involved, interactions between application-layer overlays
   and the underlying networks are a rich area of investigation.  The
   available literature in this field can be taxonomixed in two
   categories (Figure 1): using application-level techniques to estimate
   topology and through some kind of layer cooperation.

2.1.  Application-Level Topology Estimation

   Estimating network topology information on the application layer has
   been an area of active research.  Early systems used triangulation
   techniques to bound the distance between two hosts using a common
   landmark host.  In such a technique, given a cost function C, a set
   of vertexes V and their corresponding edges, the triangle inequality
   holds if for any triple {a, b, c} in V, C(a, c) is always less than
   or equal to C(a, g) + C(b, c).  The cost function C could be
   expressed in terms of desirable metrics such as bandwidth or latency.

   We note that the techniques presented in this section are only
   representative of the sizable research in this area.  Rather than
   trying to enumerate an exhaustive list, we have chosen certain
   techniques because they represent and advance in the area that
   further led to derivative works.

   Francis et al. proposed IDMaps [Francis-1], a system where one or
   more special hosts called tracers are deployed near an autonomous
   system.  The distance between hosts A and B is estimated as the
   cumulative distance between A and its nearest tracer Ta, plus the
   distance between B and its nearest tracer Tb, plus the shortest
   distance from Ta to Tb.  To aid in scalability beyond that provided
   by the client-server design of IDMaps, Ng et al. proposed a P2P-based
   global network positioning (GNP) architecture [Ng-1].  GNP was a
   network coordinate system based on absolute coordinates computed from
   modeling the Internet as a geometric space.  It proposed a two-part
   architecture: in the first part, a small set of finite distributed
   hosts called landmarks compute their own coordinates in a fixed
   geometric space.  In the second part, a host wishing to participate
   computes its own coordinates relative to those of the landmark hosts.
   Thus, armed with the computed coordinates, hosts can then determine
   interhost distance as soon as they discover each other.

   Both IDMaps and GNP require fixed network infrastructure support in
   the form of tracers or landmark hosts; this often introduces a single
   point of failure and inhibits scalability.  To combat this, new
   techniques were developed that embedded the network topology in a
   low-dimensional coordinate space to enable network distance
   estimation through vector analysis.  Costa et al. introduced
   Practical Internet Coordinates (PIC) [Costa-1].  While PIC used the
   notion of landmark hosts, it did not require explicit network support
   to designate specific landmark hosts.  Any node whose coordinates
   have been computed could act as a landmark host.  When a node joined
   the system, it probed the network distance to some landmark hosts.
   Then, it obtained the coordinates of each landmark host and computed
   its own coordinates relative to the landmark host, subject to the
   constraint of minimizing the error in the predicted distance and
   computed distance.

   Like PIC, Vivaldi [Dabek-1] proposed a fully distributed network
   coordinate systems without any distinguished hosts.  Whenever a node
   A communicates with another node B, it measures the round trip time
   (RTT) to that node and learns that node's current coordinates.  A
   subsequently adjusts its coordinates such that it is closer to, or
   further from B by computing new coordinates that minimize the squared
   error.  A Vivaldi node is thus constantly adjusting it's position
   based on a simulation of interconnected mass springs.  Vivaldi is now
   being used in the popular P2P application Azureus and studies

   indicate that it scales well to very large networks [Ledlie-1].

   Network coordinate systems require the embedding of the Internet
   topology into a coordinate system.  This is not always possible
   without errors, which impacts the accuracy of distance estimations.
   In particular, it has proved to be difficult to embed the triangular
   inequalities found in Internet path distances [Ledlie-1].  Thus,
   Meridian [Wong-1] abandons the generality of network coordinate
   systems and provides specific distance evaluation services.  In
   Meridian, each node keeps track of small fixed number of neighbors
   and organizes them in concentric rings, ordered by distance from the
   node.  Meridian locates the closest node by performing a multi-hop
   search where each hop exponentially reduces the distance to the
   target.  Although less general than virtual coordinates, Meridian
   incurs significantly less error for closest node discovery.

   The Ono project [Ono] takes a different approach and uses network
   measurements from content-distribution network (CDN) like Akamai to
   find nearby peers.  Used as a plugin to the Azureus BitTorrent
   client, Ono provides 31% average download rate improvement [Su06].

   Most of the work on estimating topology information focuses on
   predicting network distance in terms of latency and does not provide
   estimates for other metrics such as throughput or packet loss rate.
   However, for many P2P applications latency is not the most important
   performance metric and these applications could benefit from a richer
   information plane.  Sophisticated methods of active network probing
   and passive traffic monitoring are generally very powerful and can
   generate network statistics indirectly related to performance
   measures of interest, such as delay and loss rate on link-level
   granularity.  Extraction of these hidden attributes can be achieved
   by applying statistical inference techniques developed in the field
   of inferential network monitoring or network tomography subsequent to
   sampling of the network state.  Thus, network tomography enables the
   extraction of a richer set of topology information, but at the same
   time inherently increasing complexity of a potential information
   plane and introducing estimation errors.  For both active and passive
   methods statistical models for the measurement, process need to be
   developed and the spatial and temporal dependence of the measurements
   should be assessed.  Moreover, measurement methodology and
   statistical inference strategy must be considered jointly.  For a
   deeper discussion of network tomography and recent developments in
   the field we refer the reader to [CHNY02].

   One system providing such a service is iPlane [Madhyastha-1], which
   aims at creating a annotated atlas of the Internet that contains
   information about latency, bandwidth, capacity and loss rate.  To
   determine features of the Internet topology, iPlane bridges and

   builds upon different ideas, such as active probing based on packet
   dispersion techniques to infer available bandwidth along path
   segments.  These ideas are drawn from different fields, including
   network measurement as described by Dovrolis et al. in [DRM01] and
   network tomography [CHNY02].

2.2.  Topology Estimation through Layer Cooperation

   Instead of estimating topology information on the application level
   through distributed measurements, this information could be provided
   by the entities running the physical networks -- usually ISPs or
   network operators.  In fact, they have full knowledge of the topology
   of the networks they administer and, in order to avoid congestion on
   critical links, are interested in helping applications to optimize
   the traffic they generate.  The remainder of this section briefly
   describes three recently proposed solutions that follow such an
   approach to address the ALTO problem.

2.2.1.  P4P Architecture

   The architecture proposed by Xie et al.  [Xie-1] have been adopted by
   the DCIA P4P working group [P4P-1], an open group established by
   ISPs, P2P software distributors and technology researchers with the
   dual goal of defining mechanisms to accelerate content distribution
   and optimize utilization of network resources.

   The main role in the P4P architecture is played by servers called
   ``iTrackers'', deployed by network providers and accessed by P2P
   applications (or, in general, by elements of the P2P system) in order
   to make optimal decisions when selecting a peer to connect.  An
   iTracker may offer three interfaces:

   1.  Info: Allows P2P elements (e.g. peers or trackers) to get opaque
       information associated to an IP address.  Such information is
       kept opaque to hide the actual network topology, but can be used
       to compute the network distance between IP addresses.
   2.  Policy: Allows P2P elements to obtain policies and guidelines of
       the network, which specify how a network provider would like its
       networks to be utilized at a high level, regardless of P2P
       applications.
   3.  Capability: Allows P2P elements to request network providers'
       capabilities.

   The P4P architecture is under evaluation with simulations,
   experiments on the PlanetLab distributed testbed and with field tests
   with real users.  Initial simulations and PlanetLab experiments
   results [P4P-1] indicate that improvements in BitTorrent download
   completion time and link utilization in the range of 50-70% are



Rimac, et al.           Expires February 21, 2010               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                 ALTO Survey                   August 2009


   possible.  Results observed in field tests conducted with a modified
   version of the software used by the Pando content delivery network
   [OpenP4P-1] show improvements in download rate by 23% and a
   significant drop in data delivery average hop count (from 5.5 to
   0.89) in certain scenarios.

2.2.2.  Oracle-based ISP-P2P Collaboration

   The mechanism is fairly simple: a P2P user sends the list of
   potential peers to the oracle hosted by its ISP, which ranks such a
   list based on its local policies.  For instance, the ISP can prefer
   peers within its network, to prevent traffic from leaving its
   network; further, it can pick higher bandwidth links, or peers that
   are geographically closer.  Once the application has obtained an
   ordered list, it is up to it to establish connections with a number
   of peers it can individually choose, but it has enough information to
   perform an optimal choice.

   Such a solution has been evaluated with simulations and experiments
   run on the PlanetLab testbed and the results show both improvements
   in content download time and a reduction of overall P2P traffic, even
   when only a subset of the applications actually query the oracle to
   make their decisions.

2.2.3.  ISP-Driven Informed Path Selection (IDIPS) Service

   The IDIPS solution [I-D.saucez-idips] was presented during the SHIM6
   session of the 71st IETF meeting.  It is essentially a modified
   version of the solution described in section Section 2.2.2, extended
   to accept lists of source addresses other than destinations in order
   to function also as a back end for protocols like SHIM6 and LISP
   (which aim at optimizing path selection at the network layer).  An
   evaluation performed on IDIPS shows that costs for both providing and
   accessing the service are negligible [Saucez-2].


3.  Application-Level Topology Estimation and the ALTO Problem

   The application-level techniques described in Section Section 2.1
   provide tools for peer-to-peer applications to estimate parameters of
   the underlying network topology.  Although these techniques can
   improve application performance, there are limitations of what can be
   achieved by operating only on the application level.

   Topology estimation techniques use abstractions of the network
   topology which often hide features that would be of interest to the
   application.  Network coordinate systems, for example, are unable to
   detect overlay paths shorter than the direct path in the Internet



Rimac, et al.           Expires February 21, 2010               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                 ALTO Survey                   August 2009


   topology.  However, these paths frequently exist in the Internet
   [Wang-07].  Similarly, application-level techniques may not
   accurately estimate topologies with multipath routing.

   When using network coordinates to estimate topology information the
   underlying assumption is that distance in terms of latency determines
   performance.  However, for file sharing and content distribution
   applications there is more to performance than just the network
   latency between nodes.  The utility of a long-lived data transfer is
   determined by the throughput of the underlying TCP protocol, which
   depends on the round-trip time as well as the loss rate experienced
   on the corresponding path [PFTK98].  Hence, these applications
   benefit from a richer set of topology information that goes beyond
   latency including loss rate, capacity, available bandwidth.

   Some of the topology estimation techniques used by P2P applications
   need time to converge to a result.  For example, current BitTorrent
   clients implement local, passive traffic measurements and a tit-for-
   tat bandwidth reciprocity mechanism to optimize peer selection at a
   local level.  Peers eventually settle on a set of neighbors that
   maximizes their download rate but because peers cannot reason about
   the value of neighbors without actively exchanging data with them and
   the number of concurrent data transfers is limited (typically to
   5-7), convergence is delayed and easily can be sub-optimal.

   Skype's P2P VoIP application chooses a relay node in cases where two
   peers are behind NATs and cannot connect directly.  Ren et al.
   [REN-06] measured that the relay selection mechanism of Skype is (1)
   not able to discover the best possible relay nodes in terms of
   minimum RTT (2) requires a long setup and stabilization time, which
   degrades the end user experience (3) is creating a non-negligible
   amount of overhead traffic due to probing a large number of nodes.
   They further showed that the quality of the relay paths could be
   improved when the underlying network AS topology is considered.

   Some features of the network topology are hard to infer through
   application-level techniques and it may not be possible to infer them
   at all.  An example for such a features are service provider policies
   and preferences such as the state and cost associated with
   interdomain peering and transit links.  Another example is the
   traffic engineering policy of a service provider, which may
   counteract the routing objective of the overlay network leading to a
   poor overall performance [Seetharaman-1].

   Finally, application-level techniques often require applications to
   perform measurements on the topology.  These measurements create
   traffic overhead, in particular, if measurements are performed
   individually by all applications interested in estimating topology.
