         Compressed Data within an Internet EDI Message   September 2008

 
   This document explains the rules and procedures for utilizing 
   compression (RFC 3274) within an Internet EDI (Electronic
   Data Interchange) 'AS' message, as defined in RFCs 3335, 4130,
   and 4823.
    
1. Introduction

   Historically, electronic messages produced by systems following the
   guidelines as outlined in the IETF EDIINT working group
   specifications AS1[AS1], AS2[AS2] and AS3[AS3], did not have a way
   to provide a standardized transport neutral mechanism for 
   compressing large payloads. However, with the development of 
   RFC 3274 - Compressed Data Content Type for Cryptographic Message
   Syntax (CMS), we now have a transport neutral mechanism for
   compressing large payloads. 
	     
   A typical EDIINT 'AS' message is a multi-layered MIME message, 
   consisting of one or more of the following, payload layer, signature
   layer and/or the encryption layer.  When an 'AS' message is received
   a Message Integrity Check(MIC) value must be computed based upon 
   defined rules within the EDIINT 'AS' RFCs and returned to the sender
   of the message via an Message Disposition Notification(MDN). 
   
   The addition of a new compression layer will require this document to
   outline new procedures for building/layering 'AS' messages and
   computing a MIC value that is returned in the MDN receipt.  
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].
 
2. Compressed Data MIME Layer
 
   The compressed-data CMS(Cryptographic Message Syntax) MIME entity
   as described in [COMPRESSED-DATA] may encapsulate a MIME entity
   which consists of either an unsigned or signed business document. 
   
   Implementers are to follow the appropriate specifications identified
   under "References" in [MIME-TYPES], for the type of object being
   packaged. For example, to package an XML object, the MIME media 
   type of "application/xml" is used in the Content-type MIME header 
   field and the specifications for enveloping the object are 
   contained in [XMLTYPES];
   
   MIME entity example:
 
        Content-type: application/xml; charset="utf-8"
        
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <!-- sample xml document -->

         Compressed Data within an Internet EDI Message   September 2008

 
   The MIME entity will be compressed using [ZLIB] and placed inside
   a CMS compressed-data object as outlined in [COMPRESSED-DATA]. The
   compressed data object will be MIME encapsulated according to details
   outlined in [S/MIME3.1], RFC 3851, Section 3.5. 
 
Example: 
 
   Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type=compressed-data; 
           name=smime.p7z
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
   Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=smime.p7z

   Note: Content-Transfer-Encoding would only be required if the 
   compressed-data MIME bodypart is transferred via a 7-bit protocol
   like SMTP and it is visible in the outer layer of the MIME 
   message. If the compressed-data MIME bodypart is placed inside of
   an encrypted MIME bodypart, content-transfer-encoding would not be
   required on the compressed-data MIME bodypart, but would be
   required on the encrypted MIME bodypart.
 
3.  Structure of an EDI MIME compressed message
 
   When compressing a document which will be signed, the application
   MAY compress the inner most MIME body before signing, see Section 
   3.2 and 3.5 or MAY compress the outer multipart/signed MIME 
   body, see Section 3.3 and 3.6 but MUST NOT do both within
   the same document. The receiving application MUST support both
   methods of compression when unpackaging an inbound document.
   
   Note: The following sections 3.1 - 3.6 show the individual
   layers of a properly formatted EDIINT MIME message with a compressed
   data layer. Please refer to the appropriate RFCs for the proper
   construction of the resulting MIME message.

4. MIC Calculations For Compressed Messages Requesting Signed Receipts
 
4.1 MIC Calculation For Signed Message

   For any signed message, the MIC to be returned is calculated over
   the same data that was signed in the original message as per [AS1].
 
4.2 MIC Calculation For Encrypted, Unsigned Message

   For encrypted, unsigned messages, the MIC to be returned is
   calculated over the uncompressed data content including all 
   MIME header fields and any applied Content-Transfer-Encoding.
 
4.3 MIC Calculation For Unencrypted, Unsigned Message

   For unsigned, unencrypted messages, the MIC is calculated
   over the uncompressed data content including all MIME header
   fields and any applied Content-Transfer-Encoding.
 
5. Error Disposition Modifier
 
   For a received message where a signed receipt has been requested
   and decompression fails, the following disposition modifier will be
   returned in the signed MDN.
 
   "Error: decompression-failed" - the receiver could not decompress
    
6. EDIINT Version Header Field
 
   Any application that supports the compression methods outlined within
   this document MUST use a version identifier value of "1.1" or greater
   within the AS2 or AS3 Version header field as describe in [AS2] and
   [AS3].
 
7. Compression Formats
 
   Implementations SHOULD support ZLIB [ZLIB] which utilizes
   DEFLATE[DEFLATE], and is free of any intellectual property

   restrictions and has a freely-available, portable and efficient
   reference implementation.
 
8. Security Considerations
 
   This document is not concerned with security, except for the fact
   that compressing data before encryption can enhance the security by
   reducing redundancy of the file. The lower the redundancy of the
   plaintext being encrypted, the more difficult the cryptanalysis, see
   reference[CRYPTANALYSIS].
 
9. IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
