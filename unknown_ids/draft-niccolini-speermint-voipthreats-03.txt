Abstract

   This memo presents the different security threats related to
   SPEERMINT classifying them into threats to the Location Function, to
   the Signaling Function and to the Media Function.  The different
   instances of the threats are briefly introduced inside the
   classification.  Finally the existing security solutions in SIP and
   RTP/RTCP are presented to describe the countermeasures currently
   available for such threats.  The objective of this document is to
   identify and enumerate the SPEERMINT-specific threat vectors in order
   to specify security-related requirements.  Once the requirements are
   identified, methods and solutions how to achieve such requirements
   can be selected.

1.  Introduction

   With VoIP, the need for security is compounded because there is the
   need to protect both the control plane and the data plane.  In a
   legacy telephone system, security is a more valid assumption.
   Intercepting conversations requires either physical access to
   telephone lines or to compromise the Public Switched Telephone
   Network (PSTN) nodes or the office Private Branch eXchanges (PBXs).
   Only particularly security-sensitive organizations bother to encrypt
   voice traffic over traditional telephone lines.  In contrast, the
   risk of sending unencrypted data across the Internet is more
   significant (e.g.  DTMF tones corresponding to the credit card
   number).  An additional security threat to Internet Telephony comes
   from the fact that the signaling is sent using the same network as
   the multimedia data; traditional telephone systems have the signaling
   network separated from the data network.  This is an increased
   security threat since a hacker could attack the signaling network and
   its servers with increased damage potential (call hijacking, call
   drop, DoS attacks, etc.).  Therefore there is the need of
   investigating the different security threats, to extract security-
   related requirements and to highlight the solutions how to protect
   from such threats.

2.  Security Threats relevant to SPEERMINT

   This section enumerates potential security threats relevant to
   SPEERMINT.  A taxonomy of VoIP security threats is defined in [1].
   Such a taxonomy is really comprehensive and takes into account also
   non-VoIP-specific threats (e.g. loss of power, etc.).  Threats
   relevant to the boundaries of layer-5 SIP networks are extracted from
   such a taxonomy and mapped to the classification relevant for the
   SPEERMINT architecture as defined in [2], moreover additional threats
   for the SPEERMINT architecture are listed and detailed under the same
   classification and according the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and
   Availability) triad:

   o  Look-Up Function (LUF);

   o  Location Function (LF);

   o  Signaling Function (SF);

   o  Media Function (MF).

2.1.  Threats Relevant to the Look-Up Function (LUF)

   This is one of the latest additions of the terminology draft [7].
   LUF is vulenrable to the same threats that affect database systems in
   general.

2.1.1.  Threats to LUF Confidentiality

   o  SIP URIs and peering domains harvesting - an attacker can exploit
      this weakness if the underlying database has a weak authentication
      system, and then use the gained knowledge to launch other kind of
      attacks.

2.1.2.  Threats to LUF Integrity

   The underlying database could be vulnerable to:

   o  Injection attack - an attacker could manipulate statements
      performed on the database by the end user.

2.1.3.  Threats to LUF Availability

   The underlying database could be vulnerable to:

   o  Denial of Service attacks - e.g. an attacker makes incomplete
      requests causing the server to create an idle state for each of
      them causing memory to be exhausted.

2.2.  Threats Relevant to the Location Function (LF)

2.2.1.  Threats to LF Confidentiality

   o  URI harvesting - the attacker harvests URIs and IP addresses of
      the existing User Endpoints (UEs) by issuing a multitude of
      location requests.  Direct intrusion against vulnerable UEs or
      telemarketing are possible attack scenarios that would use the
      gained knowledge.

   o  SIP device enumeration - the attacker discovers the IP address of
      each intermediate signaling device by looking at the Via and
      Record-Route headers of a SIP message.  Targeting the discovered
      devices with subsequent attacks is a possible attack scenario.

2.2.2.  Threats to LF Integrity

   Bogus information can be accepted by LF if specific flaws are
   exploited (e.g. if the LF involves a Location Server, LS, that does
   not correctly validate routing data such as NAPTR records, then the
   LS may develop incorrect Session Establishment Data, SED).  Dynamic
   call routing discovery and establishment, as in scope of SPEERMINT,
   introduces new opportunities for such an attack.  In the following
   two example variants of such an attack are listed.

   o  Man-in-the-Middle attack - the attacker has already or inserts an
      unauthorized node in the signaling path modifying the SED.  The
      results is that the attacker is then able to read, insert and
      modify the multimedia communications.

   o  Incorrect destinations - the attacker redirect the calls to a
      incorrect destination with the purpose of establishing fraud
      communications like voice phishing or DoS attacks.

2.2.3.  Threats to LF Availability

   The LF can be object of DoS attacks.  DoS attacks to the LF can be
   carried out by sending a large number of queries to the LS or Session
   Manager, SM, with the result of preventing an originating SSP from
   looking up call routing data of any URI outside its administrative
   domain.  As an alternative the attacker could target the DNS to
   disable resolution of SIP addresses.

2.3.  Threats to the Signaling Function (SF)

   Signaling function involves a great number of sensitive information.
   Through signaling function, user agents (UA) assert identities and
   VSP operators authorize billable resources.  Correct and trusted

   operations of signaling function is essential for service providers.
   This section discusses potential security threats to the signaling
   function to detail the possible attack vectors.

2.3.1.  Threats to SF Confidentiality

   SF traffic is vulnerable to eavesdropping, in particular when the
   data is moved across multiple SSPs having different levels of
   security policies.  Threats for the SF confidentiality are listed
   here:

   o  call pattern analysis - the attacker tracks the call patterns of
      the users violating his/her privacy (e.g. revealing the social
      network of various users, the daily phone usage, etc.), also rival
      SSPs may infer information about the customer base of other SSPs
      in this way;

   o  Password cracking - challenge-response authentication mechanism of
      SIP is not secure if the attacker is able to eavesdrop a
      sufficient number of SIP authentication messages exchanged between
      a SIP server and a SIP client.

2.3.2.  Threats to SF Integrity

   The integrity of the SF can be violated using SIP request spoofing,
   SIP reply spoofing and SIP message tampering.

2.3.2.1.  SIP Request Spoofing

   Most SIP request spoofing require first a SIP message eavesdropping
   but some of the them could be also performed by guessing or
   exploiting broken implementations.  Threats in this category are:

      session tear down - the attacker uses CANCEL/BYE messages in order
      to tear down an existing call at SIP layer, it is needed that the
      attacker replicates the proper SIP header for the hijacking to be
      successful (To, From, Call-ID, CSeq);

      REGISTER spoofing - the attacker forges a REGISTER request and
      register a bogus contact information with the objective of
      hijacking incoming calls.

      Billing fraud - the same attack as in the case of the REGISTEr
      spoofing may lead an attacker to be able to direct billing for
      calls to the victim UE and avoid paying for the phone calls;

      user ID spoofing - SSPs are responsible for asserting the
      legitimacy of user ID; if an SSP fails to achieve the level of

Internet-Draft           SPEERMINT Security BCPs           February 2008


      identity assertion that the federation it belongs expects, it may
      create an entry point for attackers to conduct user ID spoofing
      attacks.

2.3.2.2.  SIP Reply Spoofing

   Threats in this category are:

      Forget 200 Response - the attacker sends a forged CANCEL request
      to terminate a call in progress tricking the terminating UE to
      believe that the originating UE actually sent it, and successfully
      hijacks a call sending a forged 200 OK message to the originating
      UE communicating the address of the rogue UE under the attacker's
      control;

      Forget 302 Response - the attacker sends a forged "302 Moved
      Temporarily" reply instead of a 200 OK, this enables the attack to
      hijack the call and to redirect it to any destination UE of his
      choosing;

      Forget 404 Response - the attacker sends a forged "404 Not Found"
      reply instead of a 200 OK, this enables the attack to disrupt the
      call establishment;

2.3.2.3.  SIP Message Tampering

   This threat involves the alternation of important field values in a
   SIP message or in the SDP body.  Examples of this threat could be the
   dropping or modification of handshake packets in order to avoid the
   establishment of a secure RTP session (SRTP).  The same approach
   could be used to degrade the quality of media session by letting UE
   negotiate a poor quality codec.

2.3.3.  Threats to SF Availability

   o  Flooding attack - a SBE is susceptible to message flooding attack
      that may come from interconnected SSPs;

   o  Session Black Holing - the attacker (assumed to be able to make
      Man-in-the-Middle attacks) intentionally drops essential packets,
      e.g.  INVITEs, to prevent certain calls from being established;

   o  SIP Fuzzing attack - fuzzing tests and software can be used by
      attackersto discover and exploit vulnerabilities of a SIP entity,
      this attack may result in crashing SIP entity.

Internet-Draft           SPEERMINT Security BCPs           February 2008


2.4.  Threats to the Media Function (MF)

   The Media function (MF) is responsible for the actual delivery of
   multimedia comunication between the users and carries sensitive
   information.  Through media function, UE can establish secure
   communications and monitor quality of conversations.  Correct and
   trusted operations of MF is essential for privacy and service
   assurance issues.  This section discusses potential security threats
   to the MF to detail the possible attack vectors.

2.4.1.  Threats to MF Confidentiality

   The MF is vulnerable to eavesdropping in which the attacker may
   reconstruct the voice conversation or sensitive information (e.g.
   PIN numbers from DTMF tones).  SRTP and ZRTP are vulnerable to bid-
   down attacks, i.e. by selectively dropping key exchange protocol
   packets may result in the establishment of a non-secure
   communications.

2.4.2.  Threats to MF Integrity

   Both RTP and RTCP are vulnerable to integrity violation in many ways:

   o  Media Hijack - if an attacker can somehow detect an ongoing media
      session and eavesdrop a few RTP packets, he can start sending
      bogus RTP packets to one of the UEs involved using the same codec.
      As illustrated in Fig. 8, if the bogus RTP packets have
      consistently greater timestamps and sequence numbers (but within
      the acceptable range) than the legitimate RTP packets, the
      recipient UE may accept the bogus RTP packets and discard the
      legitimate ones.

   o  Media Session Tear Down - the attacker sends bogus RTCP BYE
      messages to a target UE signaling to tear down the media
      communication, please note tha tRTCP messages are normally not
      authenticated.

   o  QoS degradation - the attacker sends wrong RTCP reports
      advertising more packet loss or more jitter than actually
      experimented resulting in the usage of a poor quality codec
      degrading the overall quality of the call experience.

2.4.3.  Threats to MF Availability

   o  Malformed messages - the attacker tries to cause a crash or a
      reboot of the DBE/UE by sending RTP/RTCP malformed messages;

   o  Messages flooding - the attacker tries to exhaust the resources of
      the DBE/UE by sending many RTP/RTCP messages.

3.  Security Best Practices

   This section describes implementer-specific BCPs to supplement the
   security requirements described in [8].  The BCPs are first described
   and then mapped to threats indicating whic BCPs are recommended to be
   used in order to solve which threats.

3.1.  Database BCPs

   Adequate security measures must be applied to the LUF to prevent it
   from being target of attacks since it involves the use of common
   database systems.  Common security BCPs for database include system
   replication to prevent any database from being a single point of
   failure, and the use of parameterized statements to prevent SQL
   injections. [9] is one of many existing literatures that describe
   BCPs in this area.

3.2.  DNSSEC

   In the case DNS is used by the LF, it is recommended to deploy the
   recent version of Domain Name System Security Extensions (informally
   called "DNSSEC-bis") defined by [10] [11] [12], to permit
   authentication and data integrity checking of DNS data.  DNSSEC adds
   new records to the DNS data which permit the validation of data in
   the DNS using strong cryptography.

3.3.  DNS Replication

   DNS replication is a very important BCP to mitigate availability
   threats.  Attacking multiple DNS servers simultaneously with the
   purpose of bringing them all them is much more challenging than
   attacking a sole DNS server (single point of failure).

3.4.  Privacy Service

   Stripping Via and Record-Route headers, replacing the Contact header,
   and even changing Call-IDs are the mechanisms described in [13] to
   protect SIP privacy.  This practice allows an SSP to hide its SIP
   network topology, prevents intermediate signaling equipment from
   becoming the target of DoS attacks, as well as protects the privacy
   of UEs according to their preferences.

3.5.  Digest Authentication on all requests

   In todays current practice, Digest authentication [14] is used to
   challenge only REGISTER and INVITE requests.  However, as a BCP, the
   more messages it is applied to the more prevention from threats is
   assured.  It is recommended to apply digest authentication to all SIP



Niccolini, et al.        Expires August 24, 2008               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           SPEERMINT Security BCPs           February 2008


   requests, including BYE and CANCEL, to prevent attacks such as
   session tear-down.

3.6.  Use TCP instead of UDP to deliver SIP messages

   Most SIP clients stay connected with the server on a persistent basis
   (differently from HTTP clients).  Scalability requirements are
   therefore much more stringent for a SIP server than for a web server.
   This leads to the choice of UDP as protocol used between SSPs to
   carry SIP messages (especially for providers with a large user
   community).  New improvements in the Linux kernel [15] show a big
   increase of the scalability of TCP in handling large number of
   persistent (but idle) connections.  Therefore SSP operators still
   using UDP for their SIP network should consider switching to TCP.
   This would increase the difficulty of performing attacks such as
   session teardown or forged responses.

3.7.  Ingress Filtering

   Ingress filtering, i.e. block all traffic coming from a host that has
   a source address different than the addresses that have been assigned
   to that host (see [16]) can effectively prevent UEs from sending
   packets with a spoofed source IP address.

3.8.  Strong Identity Assertion

   "Caller ID spoofing" can be achieved thanks to a Weak identity
   assertion on the From URI of an INVITE request.  In a single SSP
   domain, strong identity assertion can be easily achieved by
   authenticating each INVITE request.  However, in the context of
   SPEERMINT, only the originating SSP is able to verify the identity
   directly.  In order to overcome this problem there are currently only
   two major approaches: transitive trust and cryptographic signature.
   The transitive trust approach builds a chain of trust among different
   SSP domains.  One example of this approach is a combined mechanism
   specified in [17] and [18].  Using this approach in a transit peering
   network scenario, the terminating SSP must establish a trust
   relationship with all SSP domains on the path, which can be seen as
   an underlying weakness.  The use of cryptographic signatures is an
   alternative approach.  "SIP Authenticated Identity Body (AIB)" is
   specified in [19]. [6] introduces two new header fields IDENTITY and
   IDENTITY-INFO that allow a SIP server in the originating SSP to
   digitally sign an INVITE request after authenticating the sending UE.
   The terminating SSP can verify if the INVITE request is signed by a
   trusted SSP domain.  Although this approach does not require the
   terminating SSP to establish a trust relationship with all transit
   SSPs on the path, a PKI infrastructure is assumed to be in place.

3.9.  Server Pooling

   Architecture and protocols for the management of server pools
   supporting mission-critical applications is addressed in the RSERPOOL
   WG.  Using this mechanisms (see [20] for requirements) an UE obtains
   support for server failover in case of availability problems.

3.10.  Rate limit

   Packet flooding attacks can be mitigated by limiting the rate of
   incoming traffic through policing or queuing.  In this way legitimate
   clients could be denied of the service since their traffic may be
   discarded.  Rate limiting can also be applied on a per-source-IP
   basis under the assumption that the source IP of each attack packet
   is not spoofed dynamically and will all the limitations related to
   NAT and mobility issues.

3.11.  Fuzz testing

   Fuzz testing is a common black box testing technique used in software
   engineering.  Fuzz tests can be carried out preventively to assure
   UE/SBE/DBE can handle unexpected data correctly without crashing.
   [22] and [21] are examples of torture test cases specific for SIP
   devices and freely available fuzzers, respectively.  These type of
   tests needs to be carried out before product release.

3.12.  SRTCP

   Secure RTCP (SRTCP) provides the same security-related features to
   RTCP as SRTP does for RTP.  SRTCP is described in [5] as optional.
   In order to prevent some of the RTCP threats previously described it
   is recommended to turn this feature on.

3.13.  Mapping BCPs to threats

   The following table shows how to mitigate threats with the above
   mentioned BCPs.

4.  Conclusions

   This memo presented the different SPEERMINT security threats
   classified in groups related to the LUF, LF, SF and MF respectively.
   The multiple instances of the threats are presented with a brief
   explanation.  Afterwards the security BCPs for SPEERMINT are outlined
   together with possible mitigation of the existing threats by means of
   them.
