                RADIUS Attributes for Dual Stack Access
                 draft-yeh-radext-dual-stack-access-01

Abstract

   This document specifies the RADIUS attributes for IPv4 and IPv6 dual
   stack access, which are intended to be used in the AAA processes for
   the transfer of user's configuration from AAA server to NAS and
   traffic statistics reporting from NAS to AAA server.  The new
   attributes cover a specified user type for NAS to allocate the proper
   resource and employ the right mechanism for the users; and a batch of
   IPv4 and IPv6 traffic statistics for the differentiated accounting
   policies on the AAA server.

Internet-Draft              RADIUS Dual Stack                 March 2011


1.  Introduction

   IP sessions got from PPPoE can be either dual-stack IPv4/IPv6
   session, IPv6-only, or the legacy IPv4-only session.  Alternatively,
   IP session can also be obtained from IPoE.  The user in the IP
   session could be a host or a customer router.  In the IPv6 relevant
   part of the session, the customer router (CE-Customer Equipment
   Router) usually employ DHCPv6-PD to get the delegated prefix for the
   customer network, while its WAN (NAS-facing) interface could be
   either numbered or unnumbered (Section 2.3, [BBF TR-177]).  The WAN
   interface of the numbered customer router can either employ SLAAC to
   get the prefix for the interface or employ DHCPv6 to get the 128bits
   IPv6 address for interface, which acts as the same as the user of
   IPv6 host.

   There are at least the following types of users that the NAS and the
   AAA server is serveed for:

      IPv4-only - Host
      IPv6-only - Host(Numbered by SLAAC)
      IPv6-only - Host(Numbered by DHCPv6)
      IPv6-only - Customer Router(Unnumbered)
      IPv6-only - Customer Router(Numbered by SLAAC)
      IPv6-only - Customer Router(Numbered by DHCPv6)
      Dual stack - IPv4 Host + IPv6 Host(Numbered by SLAAC)
      Dual stack - IPv4 Host + IPv6 Host(Numbered by DHCPv6)
      Dual stack - IPv4 Host + IPv6 Customer Router(Unnumbered)
      Dual stack - IPv4 Host + IPv6 Customer Router(Numbered by SLAAC)
      Dual stack - IPv4 Host + IPv6 Customer Router(Numbered by DHCPv6)

   The different type of users need the NAS (Network Access Server, PE-
   Provider Edge Router or BNG-Broadband Network Gateway) employ
   different mechanism and allocate different resource for the
   associated processes.  The addresses assigned and the prefixes
   delegated to the customer hosts or routers can not only get from the
   AAA server through attributes in the Access-Accept packets, but also
   can get dynamically from the local address pool or prefix pool on the
   NAS.  That means a new attribute is required here for the right
   indication of the configuration and proper reporting between the AAA
   server and the NAS, which acts as a RADIUS client.

   IP sessions got either from PPPoE or from IPoE can support dual-stack
   users.  It is desired to support either common or separate queues on
   NAS for the IPv4 or IPv6 traffic from the users, while the QoS
   policies for the IPv4 or IPv6 traffic can be differentiated .
   Meanwhile, the NAS is required to support octets counters and packets
   counters for the combined or the separated IPv4 or IPv6 traffic
   (section 9.4, [BBF TR-187]).  After these traffic statistics is

   reported to the accounting server through RADIUS, the accounting
   policies for the IPv4 or IPv6 traffic can be differentiated.  Per the
   section 9.4 of BBF TR-187, the attributes of Acct-Input-Octets, Acct-
   Output-Octets, Acct-Input-Packets, Acct-Output-Packets are
   recommended to use for the combination traffic.  A batch of new
   RADIUS accounting attributes is required here to report the separated
   IPv4 or IPv6 traffic statistics to the Accounting Server.


2.  Terminology and Language

   This document describes some new RADIUS attributes and the associated
   usage on NAS and AAA server.  This document should be read in
   conjunction with the relevant RADIUS specifications, including
   [RFC2865], [RFC2866], [RFC2869], [RFC3162] and [RFC4818] for a
   complete mechanism.  Definitions for terms and acronyms not
   specifically defined in this document are defined in RFC2865,
   RFC2866, RFC2869, RFC3162 and RFC4818.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].
