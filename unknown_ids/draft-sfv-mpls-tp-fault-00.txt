Abstract

   This draft specifies a fault management indications for MPLS
   Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  The
   notification mechanism employs a generic method for a fault to be
   communicated to a Maintenance End Point (MEP) to indicate a fault
   condition on an MPLS LSP.  A MPLS Operation, Administration, and
   Maintenance (OAM) channel is defined along with messages to
   communicate various types of fault conditions.

Internet-Draft               MPLS Fault OAM                 October 2009


1.  Introduction

   In traditional transport networks, circuits such as T1 lines are
   provisioned on multiple switches.  When a fault occurs on any link or
   node along the path of such a transport circuit, alarms are generated
   which may in turn suppress alarms and/or activate a backup circuit.
   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) provides mechanisms to emulate
   traditional transport circuits.  Therefore a Fault Management (FM)
   capability must be defined for MPLS.  This capability is being
   defined to meet the MPLS-TP requirements as defined in RFC 5654 [1],
   and the MPLS-TP Operations, Administration and Maintenance
   Requirements as defined in draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements [2].
   However, this mechanism is intended to be applicable to other aspects
   of MPLS as well.

   Three broad classes of faults are identified.

   1.  Transient faults, that is conditions that are not yet known to be
       fatal

   2.  Fatal faults, that is service disrupting conditions that are of
       longer duration that the expected recovery time

   3.  Administrative Locking, that is disruptions that due to
       administrative locking of a server layer link

   This document specifies an MPLS OAM channel called an "MPLS-OAM Fault
   Management (FM)" channel.  A single message format and a set of
   procedures are defined to communicate faults from the location where
   they occur to the endpoints of LSPs which are affected by those
   faults.  Multiple message types are used to indicate the particular
   class of fault.

   Corresponding to the three classes of faults listed above, three
   messages are defined to communicate the type of fault.  These are
   known as:

      Alarm Indication Signal (AIS)

      Link Down Indication (LDI)

      Locked Report (LKR)

2.  MPLS Fault Management Messages

   This document defines messages to indicate three types of fault,
   Alarm Indication Signal, Link Down Indication, and Locked Report.
   These semantics of the individual messages are described in
   subsections below.

   Fault management messages are carried inband by using the Associated
   Channel Header and Generalized Alert Label as defined in RFC5586 [4].

   To facilitate recognition and delivery of Fault Management messages,
   the Fault Management channel is identified by a unique codepoint.

   When a server MEP detects a fault, fault messages are generated by
   the convergence server-to-client adaptation function.  The messages
   are sent to the client MEPs by inserting them into the affected LSPs
   in the direction opposite to the detecting MEP's peer server MEP(s).
   The message is sent periodically until the fault is cleared.

2.1.  MPLS-TP Alarm Indication Signal

   The MPLS-TP Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) message is generated in
   response to detecting defects in the server layer.  The AIS message
   MAY be sent as soon is the condition is detected, that is before any
   determination has been made as to whether the condition is fatal.
   For example an AIS message may be sent during a protection switching
   event and would cease being sent if the protection switch was
   successful in restoring the link.

   Its primary purpose is to suppress alarms in the MPLS-TP layer
   network above the level at which the defect occurs.  The AIS message
   MAY be used to trigger fault recovery mechanisms.  It should be noted
   that such use would be subject to false positives, e.g. unnecessary
   protection switching events in the client layer.

2.2.  MPLS-TP Link Down Indication

   The LDI message is generated in response to detecting a fatal failure
   in the server layer.  The LDI message MUST NOT be sent until the
   defect has been determined to be fatal.  For example during a
   protection switching event LDI messages are not sent.  However if the
   protection switch was unsuccessful in restoring the link within the
   expected repair time, an LDI message MUST be sent.

   The receipt of an LDI message SHOULD be treated as the equivalent of
   loss of continuity at the client layer.  Like AIS it also is used to
   suppress alarms.

2.3.  MPLS-TP Locked Report

   The MPLS-TP Locked Report (LKR) message is generated when a server
   layer entity has been administratively locked to communicated that
   condition to inform the client layer entities of that condition.
   When an MPLS-TP LSP is administratively locked it is not available to
   carry client traffic.  Its purpose is to suppress alarms in the
   MPLS-TP layer network above the level at which the defect occurs and
   to allow the clients to differentiate the lock condition from a
   defect condition.

   The receipt of an LKR message SHOULD be treated as the equivalent of
   loss of continuity at the client layer.  Like AIS it also is used to
   suppress alarms.


3.  MPLS Fault Management Channel

   The MPLS Fault Management channel is identified by the ACH as defined
   in RFC 5586 [4] with the Channel Type set to the MPLS Fault
   Management (FM) code point = 0xHH.  [HH to be assigned by IANA from
   the PW Associated Channel Type registry.]  The FM Channel uses ACH
   TLVs and MUST include the ACH TLV header.  The FM ACH Channel and ACH
   TLVs are shown below.

   Version

      The Version Number is currently 1.

   Flags

      One flag, the R-Flag is defined.  The other flags in this field
      MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored on receipt.

      R-flag

         The R-flag is normally set to zero.  A setting of one indicates
         the removal of a previously sent FM condition.

   Message Type

      The Message Type indicates the type of fault as listed in the
      table below.

      Msg Type           Description
      --------           -----------------------------
        0x0              Reserved

        0x2              Link Down Indication (LDI)
        0x3              Locked Report (LKR)

   Refresh Timer

      The maximum time between successive FM messages specified in
      seconds.  The range is 1 to 65535.  The value 0 is not permitted.
      The default value is 60.

   Total TLV Length

      The total TLV length is the total of all included TLVs.  At this
      time no TLVs are defined.

5.  Sending and Receiving Fault Management Messages

5.1.  Sending a Fault Indication

   Faults are indicated by sending FM messages.  The message type is set
   to the value corresponding to the fault.  The refresh timer is set to
   the maximum time between successive FM messages.  This value SHOULD
   not be changed on successive FM messages.

   The message is then prepended with an ACH TLV header.  A Global-ID
   TLV or an ICC TLV MAY be included.  The IF-ID TLV SHOULD be included.
   If the R-Flag clearing procedures are to be used, the the IF-ID TLV
   MUST be included.

   The message is then sent.  The message MUST be refreshed twice at an
   interval of one second.  Further refreshes are sent according to the
   value of the refresh timer.  Refreshing continues until the fault is
   cleared.

5.2.  Clearing a Fault Indication

   Ceasing to send FM messages will clear the fault after 3.5 times the
   Refresh Timer.  To clear a fault more quickly, the following
   procedure is used.  The R-Flag of the FM message is set to one.
   Other fields of the FM message SHOULD NOT be modified.  The message
   is sent immediately and then refreshed twice at at an interval of one
   second.

5.3.  Receiving a Fault Indication

   When a FM message is received, a MEP examines it to ensure that that
   it is well formed.  If the message type is unknown, the message is
   ignored.  If the R-Flag is zero, the corresponding defect state is
   entered.  A timer is set to 3.5 times the refresh timer.  If the
   message is not refreshed within this period, the fault is cleared.  A
   message is considered a refresh if the message type and IF-ID match
   an existing fault and the R-Flag is set to zero.

   If the R-Flag is set to one, the MEP checks to see if a fault
   matching the op-code and IF_ID exists.  If it does, that fault is
   cleared.  Otherwise the message is ignored.


6.  Issues

   1.  Should we include a TLV like the security TLV in BFD?
