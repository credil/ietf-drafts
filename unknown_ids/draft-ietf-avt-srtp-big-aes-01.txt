Internet-Draft          SRTP AES-192 and AES-256               July 2009


1.  Introduction

   This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
   [FIPS197] with 192 and 256 bit keys within the Secure RTP protocol
   [RFC3711].  Below those block ciphers are referred to as AES-192 and
   AES-256, respectively, and the use of AES with a 128 bit key is
   referred to as AES-128.  This document defines Counter Mode
   encryption for SRTP and SRTCP and a new SRTP Key Derivation Function
   for AES-192 and AES-256.  It also defines new cryptosuites that use
   these new functions.

   While AES-128 is widely regarded as more than adequately secure, some
   users may be motivated to adopt AES-192 or AES-256.  One motivation
   is conformance to the Suite B profile (which requires AES-256 for the
   protection of TOP SECRET information) [suiteB].  Others may be
   motivated by a perceived need to purse a highly conservative security
   strategy; see Section 6 for more discussion of security issues.

   The crypto functions defined in this document are an addition to, and
   not a replacement for, the crypto functions defined in [RFC3711].

1.1.  Conventions Used In This Document

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  AES-192 and AES-256 Encryption

   Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] defines AES-128 counter mode encryption,
   which it refers to as AES_CM.  AES-192 counter mode and AES-256
   counter mode are defined in a similar manner, and are denoted as
   AES_192_CM and AES_256_CM respectively.  In both of these ciphers,
   the plaintext inputs to the block cipher are formed as in AES_CM, and
   the block cipher outputs are processed as in AES_CM.  The only
   difference in the processing is that AES_192_CM uses AES-192, and
   AES_256_CM uses AES-256.  Both AES_192_CM and AES_256_CM use a 112-
   bit salt as an input, as does AES_CM.

   For the convenience of the reader, the structure of the counter
   blocks in SRTP counter mode encryption is illustrated in Figure 1,
   using the terminology from Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] .  In this
   diagram, the symbol (+) denotes the bitwise exclusive-or operation,
   and the AES encrypt operation uses AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256 for
   AES_CM, AES_192_CM, and AES_256_CM, respectively.  The field labeled
   b_c contains a block counter, the value of which increments once for
   each invocation of the "AES Encrypt" function.

3.  The AES_192_CM_PRF and AES_256_CM_PRF Key Derivation Functions

   Section 4.3.3 of [RFC3711] defines AES-128 counter mode key
   derivation function, which it refers to as "AES-CM PRF".  (That
   specification uses the term PRF, or pseudo-random function,
   interchangeably with the term "key derivation function". ) The AES-
   192 counter mode PRF and AES-256 counter mode PRF are defined in a
   similar manner, and are denoted as AES_192_CM_PRF and AES_256_CM_PRF
   respectively.  In both of these PRFs, the plaintext inputs to the
   block cipher are formed as in the AES-CM PRF, and the block cipher
   outputs are processed as in the AES-CM PRF.  The only difference in
   the processing is that AES_192_CM_PRF uses AES-192, and
   AES_256_CM_PRF uses AES-256.  Both AES_192_CM_PRF and AES_256_CM_PRF
   use a 112-bit salt as an input, as does the AES-CM PRF.

   For the convenience of the reader, the structure of the counter
   blocks in SRTP counter mode key derivation is illustrated in
   Figure 2, using the terminology from Section 4.3.3 of [RFC3711].  In
   this diagram, the symbol (+) denotes the bitwise exclusive-or
   operation, and the "AES Encrypt" operation uses AES-128, AES-192, or
   AES-256 for the "AES-CM PRF", AES_192_CM_PRF, and AES_256_CM_PRF,
   respectively.  The field "LB" contains the 8-bit constant "label"
   which is provided as an input to the key derivation function (and
   which is distinct for each type of key generated by that function).
   The field labeled b_c contains a block counter, the value of which
   increments once for each invocation of the "AES Encrypt" function.

3.1.  Usage Requirements

   When AES_192_CM is used for encryption, AES_192_CM SHOULD be used as
   the key derivation function, and AES_128_CM MUST NOT be used as the
   key derivation function.

   When AES_256_CM is used for encryption, AES_256_CM SHOULD be used as
   the key derivation function.  Both AES_128_CM and AES_192_CM MUST NOT
   be used as the key derivation function.

      Rationale: it is essential that the cryptographic strength of the
      key derivation meets or exceeds that of the encryption method.  It
      is natural to use the same function for both encryption and key
      derivation.  However, it is not required to do so because it is
      desirable to allow these ciphers to be used with alternative key
      derivation functions that may be defined in the future.

4.  Crypto Suties

   This section defines SRTP crypto suites that use the ciphers and key
   derivation functions defined in this document.  These suites are
   registered with IANA for use with the SDP Security Descriptions
   attributes (Section 10.3.2.1 of [RFC4568]).  Other SRTP key
   management methods that use the crypto functions defined in this
   document are encouraged to also use these crypto suite definitions.

6.  Security Considerations

   AES-128 provides a level of security that is widely regarded as being
   more than sufficient for providing confidentiality.  It is believed
   that the economic cost of breaking AES-128 is significantly higher
   than the cost of more direct approaches to violating system security,
   e.g. theft, bribery, wiretapping, and other forms of malfeasance.

   Future advances in the state of the art of cryptanalysis could
   eliminate this confidence in AES-128, and motivate the use of AES-192
   or AES-256.  AES-192 is regarded as being secure even against some
   adversaries for which breaking AES-128 may be feasible.  Similarly,
   AES-256 is regarded as being secure even against some adversaries for
   which it may be feasible to break AES-192.  The availability of the
   larger key size versions of AES provides a fallback plan in case of
   unanticipated cryptanalytic results.

   It is conjectured that AES-256 provides adequate security even
   against adversaries that possess the ability to construct a quantum
   computer that works on 256 or more quantum bits.  No such computer is
   known to exist; its feasibility is an area of active speculation and
   research.

   Despite the apparent sufficiency of AES-128, some users are
   interested in the larger AES key sizes.  For some applications, the
   40% increase in computational cost for AES-256 over AES-128 is a
   worthwhile bargain when traded for the security advantages outlined
   above.  These applications include those with a perceived need for
   very high security, e.g. due to a desire for very long-term
   confidentiality.

   As with any cipher, the conjectured security level of AES may change
   over time.  The considerations in this section reflect the best
   knowledge available at the time of publication of this document.

   It is desirable that AES_192_CM and AES_192_CM_PRF be used with an
   authentication function that uses a 192 bit key, and that AES_256_CM
   and AES_256_CM_PRF be used with an authentication function that uses
   a 256 bit key.  However, this desire is not regarded as security-
   critical.  Cryptographic authentication is resilient against future
   advances in cryptanalysis, since the opportunity for a forgery attack
   against a session closes when that session closes.

7.2.  AES_256_CM_PRF Test Cases

   This section provides test data for the AES_256_CM_PRF key derivation
   function, which uses AES-256 in Counter Mode.  In the following, we
   walk through the initial key derivation for the AES-256 Counter Mode
   cipher, which requires a 32 octet session encryption key and a 14
   octet session salt, and the HMAC-SHA1 authentication function, which
   requires a 20-octet session authentication key.  These values are
   called the cipher key, the cipher salt, and the auth key in the
   following.  Since this is the initial key derivation and the key
   derivation rate is equal to zero, the value of (index DIV
   key_derivation_rate) is zero (actually, a six-octet string of zeros).
   In the following, we shorten key_derivation_rate to kdr.

   The inputs to the key derivation function are the 32 octet master key
   and the 14 octet master salt:

         master key:  f0f04914b513f2763a1b1fa130f10e29
                      98f6f6e43e4309d1e622a0e332b9f1b6
         master salt: 3b04803de51ee7c96423ab5b78d2

   We first show how the cipher key is generated.  The input block for

   AES-256-CM is generated by exclusive-oring the master salt with the
   concatenation of the encryption key label 0x00 with (index DIV kdr),
   then padding on the right with two null octets (which implements the
   multiply-by-2^16 operation, see Section 4.3.3 of RFC 3711).  The
   resulting value is then AES-256-CM- encrypted using the master key to
   get the cipher key.

      index DIV kdr:                 000000000000
      label:                       00

      xor:           3b04803de51ee7c96423ab5b78d2     (x, PRF input)

      x*2^16:        3b04803de51ee7c96423ab5b78d20000 (AES-256-CM input)
      x*2^16 + 1:    3b04803de51ee7c96423ab5b78d20001 (2nd AES input)

      cipher key:    5ba1064e30ec51613cad926c5a28ef73 (1st AES output)
                     1ec7fb397f70a960653caf06554cd8c4 (2nd AES output)

   Next, we show how the cipher salt is generated.  The input block for
   AES-256-CM is generated by exclusive-oring the master salt with the
   concatenation of the encryption salt label.  That value is padded and
   encrypted as above.

      index DIV kdr:                 000000000000
      label:                       02
      master salt:   3b04803de51ee7c96423ab5b78d2

      ----------------------------------------------
      xor:           3b04803de51ee7cb6423ab5b78d2     (x, PRF input)

      x*2^16:        3b04803de51ee7cb6423ab5b78d20000 (AES-256-CM input)

      cipher salt:   fa31791685ca444a9e07c6c64e93

   We now show how the auth key is generated.  The input block for AES-
   256-CM is generated as above, but using the authentication key label.

7.4.  AES_192_CM_PRF Test Cases

   This section provides test data for the AES_256_CM_PRF key derivation
   function, which uses AES-256 in Counter Mode.  In the following, we
   walk through the initial key derivation for the AES-256 Counter Mode
   cipher, which requires a 32 octet session encryption key and a 14

   octet session salt, and the HMAC-SHA1 authentication function, which
   requires a 20-octet session authentication key.  These values are
   called the cipher key, the cipher salt, and the auth key in the
   following.  Since this is the initial key derivation and the key
   derivation rate is equal to zero, the value of (index DIV
   key_derivation_rate) is zero (actually, a six-octet string of zeros).
   In the following, we shorten key_derivation_rate to kdr.

   The inputs to the key derivation function are the 32 octet master key
   and the 14 octet master salt:

         master key:  73edc66c4fa15776fb57f9505c171365
                      50ffda71f3e8e5f1
         master salt: c8522f3acd4ce86d5add78edbb11

   We first show how the cipher key is generated.  The input block for
   AES-256-CM is generated by exclusive-oring the master salt with the
   concatenation of the encryption key label 0x00 with (index DIV kdr),
   then padding on the right with two null octets (which implements the
   multiply-by-2^16 operation, see Section 4.3.3 of RFC 3711).  The
   resulting value is then AES-256-CM- encrypted using the master key to
   get the cipher key.

      index DIV kdr:                 000000000000
      label:                       00
      master salt:   c8522f3acd4ce86d5add78edbb11
      -----------------------------------------------
      xor:           c8522f3acd4ce86d5add78edbb11     (x, PRF input)

      x*2^16:        c8522f3acd4ce86d5add78edbb110000 (AES-256-CM input)
      x*2^16 + 1:    c8522f3acd4ce86d5add78edbb110001 (2nd AES input)

      cipher key:    6da8e1e082a06aa80e5cbb0661a5174a (1st AES output)
                     3b8636251d8e4c539e5923b5ddb30cd4 (2nd AES output)

   Next, we show how the cipher salt is generated.  The input block for
   AES-256-CM is generated by exclusive-oring the master salt with the
   concatenation of the encryption salt label.  That value is padded and
   encrypted as above.

   We now show how the auth key is generated.  The input block for AES-
   256-CM is generated as above, but using the authentication key label.

    on the left, while the corresponding AES-256 input blocks are shown
    on the right.  Note that the final AES-256 output is truncated to a
