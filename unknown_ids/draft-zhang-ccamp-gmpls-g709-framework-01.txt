1. Introduction 

   OTN has become a mainstream layer 1 technology for the transport 
   network. It is desirable for operators to be able to introduce 
   control plane capabilities based on  Generalized Multi-Protocol Label

   Switching (GMPLS) to OTN networks, so as to realize its associated 
   benefits (e.g., improved network resiliency, resource usage 
   efficiency, etc.). 

   GMPLS extends MPLS to encompass time division multiplexing (TDM) 
   networks (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, and G.709 sub-lambda), lambda 
   switching optical networks, and spatial switching (e.g., incoming 
   port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber). The GMPLS architecture is 
   provided in[RFC3945], signaling function and Resource ReserVation 
   Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions are described in 
   [RFC3471] and [RFC3473], routing and OSPF extensions are described in 
   [RFC4202] and [RFC4203], and the link management protocol is 
   described in [RFC4204].  

   The existing GMPLS protocol suite provides the mechanisms for basic 
   GMPLS control of OTN networks, using ITU-T G.709 interfaces as 
   specified in 2003 [ITU-T-G.709]. It should be noted that there are 
   some differences between SDH/SONET TDM networks and OTN networks 
   resulting from some new features recently introduced in ITU-T; for 
   example, various multiplexing structures, two types of Tributary 
   Slots (i.e., 1.25Gbps and 2.5Gbps), and extension of the ODUj 
   definition to include the ODUflex function.  

   This document reviews relevant aspects of OTN technology evolution 
   affecting GMPLS control plane protocols, including PCE implications, 
   and provides a framework for the control of OTN networks. 

   For the purposes of the control plane the OTN can be considered as 
   being comprised of sub-wavelength (ODU) and wavelength (OCh) layers. 
   This document focuses on the control of the sub-wavelength layer, 
   with control of the wavelength layer considered out of the scope. 
   Please refer to [WSON-Frame] for further information.

   10/2009), G.872 and G.8080 (planned for consent in 6/2010)]

3. G.709 Optical Transport Network (OTN) 

   This section provides an informative overview of those aspects of the 
   OTN impacting control plane protocols.  This overview is based on the 
   ITU-T Recommendations that contain the normative definition of the 
   OTN. Technical details regarding OTN architecture and interfaces are 
   provided in the relevant ITU-T Recommendations. 
    
   Specifically, [ITU-T-G.872] describes the functional architecture of 
   optical transport networks providing optical signal transmission, 
   multiplexing, routing, supervision, performance assessment, and 
   network survivability.  [ITU-T-G.709] defines the interfaces of the 
   optical transport network to be used within and between subnetworks 
   of the optical network.  With the evolution and deployment of OTN 
   technology many new features have been specified in ITU-T 
   recommendations, including for example, new ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 and 
   ODUflex containers as described in [G709-V3]. 
    
    
3.1. OTN Layer Network 

   The simplified structure of OTN is shown in Figure 1, which 
   illustrates the layers that are of interest to the control plane. 
   Other layers below OCh (e.g. OTS) are not included in this Figure. 
   The full signal structure is provided in G.709.

                    Figure 1 Basic OTN signal structure 
    
   Client signals are mapped into the appropriate ODUj containers.  
   These ODUj containers are multiplexed onto the OTU/OCh.  The 
   individual OTU/OCh signals are combined in the OMS (using WDM 
   multiplexing), and this aggregated signal provides the link between 
   the nodes.

   3.1.1 Client signal mapping 
    
   The client signals are mapped into a Low Order (LO) ODUj. Appendix A 
   gives more information about LO ODU. 
   The current values of j are: 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, 4, Flex.  The 
   approximate bit rates of these signals are defined in 2 [G709-V3] and 
   are reproduced in Tables 1 and 2.

                      Table 2 ODU types and tolerance 
    
   The ODUflex uses one of two mapping options depending on the client 
   signal type:  
   - Circuit clients: are proportionally wrapped, thus the bit rate and 
     tolerance are defined by the client signal. 

   - Packet clients are GFP mapped:  G.709 recommends that the bit rate 
     is set to an integer multiplier of HO OPUk TS rate, the tolerance is 
     +/- 20ppm and the bit rate is determined by the node that performs 
     the mapping. 
    
   3.1.1.1 ODUj types and parameters 
    
   Some information needs to be provided when ODUj connections are setup. 
   We have two types of information that should be conveyed in a 
   connection request:  
    
   (a)End to end: 
   Client payload type (e.g. STM64; Ethernet etc.) 
   Bit rate and tolerance:  Note for j = 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, 4 this 
   information may be carried as an enumerated type.  For the ODUflex 
   the actual bit rate and tolerance must be provided. 
    
   (b)Link by link:

   TS assignment and port number (carried by the MSI bytes) as described 
   in section 3.1.2. 
    
   3.1.2 Multiplexing ODUj onto Links 
    
   The links between the switching nodes are provided by one or more 
   wavelengths.  Each wavelength carries one OCh, which carries one OTU, 
   which carries one OPU.  Since all of these signals have a 1:1:1 
   relationship, we only refer to the OTU for clarity.  The ODUjs are 
   mapped into the Tributary Slots (TS) of the OTUk.  Note that in the 
   case where j=k the ODUj is mapped into the OTU/OCh without 
   multiplexing.   
    
   The initial versions of G.709 only provided a single TS granularity, 
   nominally 2.5Gb/s.  Amendment 3, approved in 2009, added an 
   additional TS granularity, nominally 1.25Gb/s. The number and type of 
   TSs provided by each of the currently identified OTUk is provided 
   below: 
    
        2.5Gb/s 1.25Gb/s Nominal Bit rate  
   OTU1    1       2         2.5Gb/s 
   OTU2    4       8          10Gb/s 
   OTU3   16      32          40Gb/s 
   OTU4   --      80         100Gb/s 
    
   To maintain backwards compatibility while providing the ability to 
   interconnect nodes that support 1.25Gb/s TS at one end of a link and 
   2.5Gb/s TS at the other, the ''new'' equipment will fall back to the 
   use of a 2.5Gb/s TS if connected to legacy equipment.  This 
   information is carried in band by the payload type. 
   [Note:  Automatic negotiation may be added in a future version of 
   G.798, otherwise the discovery extensions described below will be 
   required]. 
    
   The actual bit rate of the TS in an OTUk depends on the value of k.  
   Thus the number of TS occupied by an ODUj may vary depending on the 
   values of j and k.  For example an ODU2e uses 9TS in an OTU3 but only 
   8 in an OTU4. Examples of the number of TS used for various cases are 
   provided below:

   An ODUj must be carried by a single OTU.  The available capacity 
   between nodes is the sum of the available capacity on the OTUs that 
   interconnect the nodes.  This total capacity is represented as a link 
   bundle. Note that the available capacity will typically be 
   distributed across multiple OTUs, thus the maximum payload size (i.e. 
   the maximum number of TS on the bundled link which is determined by a 
   single OTU with the maximum number of TS) should also be provided. 
    
   A (local) Tributary Port Number (TPN) for the TS to be used to carry 
   an ODUj must be provided when an ODUj connection is set up. This

   information is mapped into the MSI bytes. The control plane must 
   convey the TPN information to the receiving end of the link.  The TPN 
   is used (by the hardware) at the receiving end of the link to verify 
   the configuration. 
    
   In general the mapping of an ODUj (including ODUflex) into the OTUk 
   TSs is determined locally, and it can also be explicitly allocated by 
   a specific entity (e.g., head end, NMS) through Explicit Label 
   Control [RFC3473].   
    
   The allocation of the fixed and variable stuff bytes is dependent on 
   the bit rate and bit rate tolerance of the payload being mapped and 
   the TS capacity of the (local) OTUk link that has been selected. 
    
   3.1.2.1 Link Parameters 
    
   The critical parameters that need to be provided (for the purposes of 
   routing) are: 
   - Number of TS 

   - Maximum number of TS available for a LSP (i.e., Maximum LSP 
     Bandwidth) 

   - Bit rate of the TS. (Note: This may be efficiently encoded as a 
     two integers representing the value of k and the granularity.)
    
4. Connection management in OTN 

   As [ITU-T-G.872] described, OTN-based transport network equipment is 
   concerned with control of connectivity of ODU paths and optical 
   channels and not with control of connectivity of the client layer. 
   This document focuses on the connection management of ODU paths.  The 
   management of OCh paths is described in [WSON-FRAME]. 

   [Note: Work is currently in progress in Q.12/15 to update G.872 to 
   describe the ODU layer as a single layer network with the bit rate as 
   a parameter.  This allows the links and nodes to be viewed in a 
   single topology as a common set of resources that are available to 
   provide ODUj connects (independent of the value of j). Optionally the 
   OCh layer may also be visible within this routing topology.

4.1. Connection management of OCh 

   An OCh connection request needs a light path from source to 
   destination. This path computation is known as the Routing and 
   Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem [HZang00]. In the case of full 
   wavelength converters at each node, OCh path computation is 
   equivalent to a circuit-switch TDM network with full time slot 
   interchange capability. The control of connectivity of optical 
   channels is within the scope of WSON (Wavelength Switched Optical 
   Networks) ongoing working in CCAMP Working Group in IETF.  

   OCh connections are managed as part of the ODU connection set up. OCh 
   connections do not exist outside the scope of a ODU in the OTN. 

4.2. Connection management of the ODU 

   LO ODUj can be either mapped into the OTUk signal (j = k), or 
   multiplexed with other LO ODUjs into an OTUk (j < k), and the OTUk is 
   mapped into an OCh. See Appendix A for more information. 

   From the perspective of routing for the case where j < k (i.e. ODUjs 
   are multiplexed onto an OTUk) the topology may be viewed as 
   illustrated below. In the case of LO ODUj mapping into OTUk (k = j), 
   Figure 2 give an example of this kind of LO ODU connection.

   If an ODUj connection is requested (for example) between Node C and Node 
   E routing/path computation must select a path that has the required 
   number of TS available and that offers the lowest cost.  Signaling is 
   then invoked to set up the path and to provide the information required 
   by each transit node to allow the configuration of the ODUj to OTUk

   bytes are selected using the ODUj parameters described above.   

   If the ODUj is an ODU1, ODU2, ODU3 or ODU4 it may be mapped directly on

   which case the topology would be as shown below in figure 4

   In Figure 4, the cloud of previous figure is substitute by the real 
   topology. The nodes f,g,h are nodes with OCH switching capability. LO 
   ODU j mapping over OTU k=J is represented by the alternative links 
   between nodes C, node g, node E, node f, node B and node h. 
   In this case the ODU routing/path selection process will request an OCh 
   connection between node C to node E from the RWA domain. The connection 
   will appear at ODU level as a Forwarding adjacency. The ODU routing/path 
   selection will compare the cost of this connection (FA) to the cost of 
   using the (visible) links used in case of j<K (multiplexing case). 
 
5. GMPLS/PCE Implications 

   The purpose of this section is to provide a framework for extensions of 
   the current GMPLS protocol suite and the PCE applications and protocols 
   to encompass OTN enhancements and connection management. 

5.1. Implications for LSP Hierarchy with GMPLS TE 

   The path computation for LO ODU connection request is based on the 
   topology of ODU layer, including OCh layer visibility.  

   The OTN path computation can be divided into two layers. One layer is 
   OCh/OTUk, the other is LO ODUj. [RFC4206] defines the mechanisms to 
   accomplish creating the hierarchy of LSPs. The LSP management of 
   multiple layers in OTN can follow the procedures defined in [RFC4206] 
   and related MLN drafts. 

   As discussed in section 4, the route path computation for OCh is in 
   the scope of WSON [WSON-Frame]. Therefore, this document only 
   considers ODU layer for LO ODU connection request since the OCh layer 
   is being discussed in the WSON scope [WSON-Frame]. 

5.2. Implications for GMPLS Signaling 

   The signaling function and Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic 
   Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions are described in [RFC3471] and [RFC 
   3473]. For OTN-specific control, [RFC4328] defines signaling 
   extensions to support G.709 Optical Transport Networks Control.  

   The evolution of OTN in ITU-T has introduced some new features, 
   including, for example, new ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 and ODUflex containers. 
   Support for relevant associated multiplexing capabilities has also 
   becomes essential with this technology evolution. 

   It is obvious that [RFC4328] cannot support such new OTN features and 
   networking flexibility from a control plane perspective.  Thus, a new

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-g709-framework-01.txt             December 2009 
    

   RFC is needed to define the extensions that are required to support 
   the evolution of OTN. 

   5.2.1. Identifying OTN signals 

   [RFC4328] defines the LSP Encoding Type, the Switching Type and the 
   Generalized Protocol Identifier (Generalized-PID) constituting the 
   common part of the Generalized Label Request. The G.709 Traffic 
   Parameters are also defined in [RFC4328].  The following new signal 
   types have been added since [RFC4328] was published: 

   (1)New signal types of sub-lambda layer 

      Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUj): 

           ODU0 

           ODU2e 

           ODU4 

           ODUflex 

   (2)A new Tributary Slot (TS) granularity (i.e., 1.25 Gbps) 

   (3)Signal type with variable bandwidth: 

      ODUflex has a variable bandwidth/bit rate BR and a bit rate 
      tolerance T. As described above the (node local) mapping process 
      must be aware of the bit rate and tolerance of the ODUj being 
      multiplexed in order to select the correct number of TS and the 
      fixed/variable stuffing bytes. Therefore, bit rate and bit rate 
      tolerance should be carried in the Traffic Parameter in the 
      signaling of connection setup request. 

   (4)Extended multiplexing hierarchy (For example, ODU0 into OTU2 
      multiplexing (with 1,25Gbps TS granularity).) 

   So the encoding provided in [RFC4328] needs to be extended to support 
   all the signal types and related mapping and multiplexing with all 
   kinds of tributary slots. Moreover, the extensions should consider 
   the extensibility to match future evolvement of OTN.  

   For item (1) and (3), new traffic parameters may need to be extended 
   in signaling message; 


 
 
zhang                    Expires June 2010                  [Page 13] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-g709-framework-01.txt             December 2009 
    

   For item (2) and (4), new label should be defined to carry the exact 
   TS allocation information related to the extended multiplexing 
   hierarchy. 

   5.2.2. Tributary Port Number 

   The tributary port number may be assigned locally by the node at the 
   (traffic) ingress end of the link and in this case as described above 
   must be conveyed to the far end of the link as a ''transparent'' 
   parameter i.e. the control plane does not need to understand this 
   information. The TPN may also be assigned by the control plane as a 
   part of path computation. 

5.3. Implications for GMPLS Routing 

   The path computation process should select a suitable route for a 
   ODUj connection request. In order to compute the lowest cost path it 
   must evaluate the number (and availability) of tributary slots on 
   each candidate link.  The routing protocol should be extended to 
   convey some information to represent ODU TE topology.  As described 
   above the number of tributary slots (on a link bundle), the bandwidth 
   of the TS and the maximum number that are available to convey a 
   single ODUj must be provided. 

   GMPLS Routing [RFC4202] defines Interface Switching Capability 
   Descriptor of TDM which can be used for ODU. However, some other 
   issues should also be considered which are discussed below. 

5.3.1. Requirement for conveying Interface Switching Capability specific 
   information 

   Interface Switching Capability Descriptors present a new constraint   
   for LSP path computation. [RFC4203] defines the switching capability 
   and related Maximum LSP Bandwidth and the Switching Capability 
   specific information. When the Switching Capability field is TDM the 
   Switching Capability specific information field includes Minimum LSP 
   Bandwidth, an indication whether the interface supports Standard or 
   Arbitrary SONET/SDH, and padding. So routing protocol should be 
   extended when TDM is ODU type to support representation of ODU 
   switching information. 

   As discussed in section 3.1.2, many different types of ODUj can be 
   multiplexed into the same OTUk. For example, both ODU0 and ODU1 may 
   be multiplexed into ODU2. An OTU link may support one or more types 
   of ODUj signals. The routing protocol should be extended to carry 
   this multiplexing capability. Furthermore, one type of ODUj can be 
   multiplexed to an OTUk using different tributary slot granularity. 
 
 
zhang                    Expires June 2010                  [Page 14] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-g709-framework-01.txt             December 2009 
    

   For example, ODU1 can be multiplexed into ODU2 with either 2.5Gbps TS 
   granularity or 1.25G TS granularity. The routing protocol should be 
   extended to carry which TS granularity supported by the ODU interface. 

   Moreover, the bit rate (i.e., bandwidth) of TS can be determined by 
   the TS granularity and link type of the TE link. For example, the 
   bandwidth of a 1.25G TS without NJO (Negative Justification 
   Opportunity) in an OTU2 is about 1.249409620 Gbps, while the 
   bandwidth of a 1.25G TS without NJO in an OTU3 is about 1.254703729 
   Gbps. So The routing protocol should be extended to carry the TE link 
   type (OTUk/HO ODUk). 

   In OTN networks, it is simpler to use the number of Tributary Slots 
   for the bandwidth accounting. For example, Total bandwidth of the TE 
   link, Unreserved Bandwidth of the TE link and the Maximum LSP 
   Bandwidth can be accounted through the number of Tributary Slots 
   (e.g., the total number of the Tributary Slots of the TE link, the 
   unreserved Tributary Slots of the TE link, Maximum Tributary Slots 
   for an LSP). Thus, the routing protocol should be extended to carry 
   the Tributary Slots information related to bandwidth of the TE link. 

5.4. Implications for Link Management Protocol (LMP) 

   As discussed in section 5.3, Path computation needs to know the 
   interface switching capability of links. The switching capability of 
   two ends of the link may be different, so the link capability of two 
   ends should be correlated.  

   5.4.1. Correlating the Granularity of the TS 

   As discussed in section 3.1.2, the two ends of a link may support 
   different TS granularity. In order to allow interconnection the node 
   with 1.25Gb/s granularity must fall back to 2.5Gb/s granularity. 

   Therefore, it is necessary for the two ends of a link to correlate 
   the granularity of the TS.  This ensures that both ends of the link 
   advertise consistent capabilities (for routing) and ensures that 
   viable connections are established. 

   [Note: Work in Q.9/15 on an auto negotiation mechanism may eliminate 
   the need for discovery by the control plane since both ends of the 
   link will be aware of the capability]. 

   5.4.2. Correlating the Supported LO ODU Signal Types 

   Many new ODU signal types have been introduced [G709-V3], such as 
   ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex. It is possible that equipment does not

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-g709-framework-01.txt             December 2009 
    

   support all the LO ODU signal types introduced by those new standards 
   or drafts. If one end of a link can not support a certain LO ODU 
   signal type, the link cannot be selected to carry such type of LO ODU 
   connection. 

   Therefore, it is necessary for the two ends of an HO ODU link to 
   correlate which types of LO ODU can be supported by the link. After 
   correlating, the capability information can be flooded by IGP, so 
   that the correct path for an ODU connection can be calculated. 

5.5. Implications for Path Computation Elements 

   [PCE-APS] describes the requirements for GMPLS applications of PCE in 
   order to establish GMPLS LSP. PCE needs to consider the GMPLS TE 
   attributes appropriately once a PCC or another PCE requests a path 
   computation. The TE attributes which can be contained in the path 
   calculation request message from the PCC or the PCE defined in [PCECP] 
   includes switching capability, encoding type, signal type, etc. 

   As described in section 5.2.1, new signal types and new signals with 
   variable bandwidth information need to be carried in the extended 
   signaling message of path setup. For the same consideration, PCECP 
   also has a desire to be extended to carry the new signal type and 
   related variable bandwidth information when a PCC requests a path 
   computation.

APPENDIX A: Description of LO ODU terminology and ODU connection 
            examples. 

   This appendix provides a description of LO ODU terminology and ODU 
   connection examples. This section is not normative which is just a 
   reference in order to facilitate quicker understanding of text. 

   In order to transmit client signal, the LO ODU connection must be 
   created first. From the perspective of [G709-V3], there are two types 
   of LO ODU:   

   (1) A LO ODUj mapped into an OTUk. In this case, the server layer of 
   this LO ODU is an OTUk. For example, if a STM-16 signal is 
   encapsulated into ODU1, and then ODU1 is mapped into OTU1, the ODU1   
   is a LO ODU.  

   (2) A LO ODUj multiplexed into a HO (Higher Order) ODUk (j < k)    
   occupying several TSs. In this case, the server layer of this LO ODU   
   is a HO ODUk. For example, if ODU1 is multiplexed into ODU2, and ODU2   
   is mapped into OTU2, the ODU1 is LO ODU and ODU2 is HO ODU.  

   The LO ODUj represents the container transporting a client of the OTN 
   that is either directly mapped into an OTUk (k = j) or multiplexed 
   into a server HO ODUk (k > j)container. Consequently, the HO ODUk 
   represents the entity transporting a multiplex of LO ODUj tributary 
   signals in its OPUk area. 

   In the case of LO ODUj mapped into an OTUk (k = j) directly, Figure 5 
   give an example of this kind of LO ODU connection. 

   In Figure 5, The LO ODUj is switched at the intermediate ODXC node. 
   OCh and OTUk are associated with each other. From the viewpoint of 
   connection management, the management of OTUk is similar with OCh. LO 
   ODUj and OCh/OTUk have client/server relationships.  

   For example, one LO ODU1 connection can be setup between Node A and 
   Node C. This LO ODU1 connection is to be supported by OCh/OTU1 
   connections, which are to be set up between Node A and Node B and 
   between Node B and Node C. LO ODU1 can be mapped into OTU1 at Node A,

                   Figure 5 Connection of LO ODUj (1) 

   In the case of LO ODUj multiplexing into HO ODUk, Figure 6 gives an 
   example of this kind of LO ODU connection. 

   In Figure 6, OCh, OTUk, HO ODUk are associated with each other. The 
   LO ODUj is multiplexed/de-multiplexed into/from the HO ODU at each 
   ODXC node and switched at each ODXC node (i.e. trib port to line port, 
   line card to line port, line port to trib port). From the viewpoint 
   of connection management, the management of these HO ODUk and OTUk 
   are similar to OCh. LO ODUj and OCh/OTUk/HO ODUk have client/server 
   relationships. when a LO ODU connection is setup, it will be using 
   the existing HO ODUk (/OTUk/OCh) connections which have been set up. 
   Those HO ODUk connections provide LO ODU links, of which the LO ODU 
   connection manager requests a link connection to support the LO ODU 
   connection.  

   For example, one HO ODU2 (/OTU2/OCh) connection can be setup between 
   Node A and Node B, another HO ODU3 (/OTU3/OCh) connection can be 
   setup between Node B and Node C. LO ODU1 can be generated at Node A, 
   switched to one of the 10G line ports and multiplexed into a HO ODU2 
   at Node A, demultiplexed from the HO ODU2 at Node B, switched at Node 
   B to one of the 40G line ports and multiplexed into HO ODU3 at Node B, 
   demultiplexed from HO ODU3 at Node C and switched to its LO ODU1 
   terminating port at Node C.
