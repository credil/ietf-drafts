Abstract

   A Path Computation Element (PCE) performing dependent path
   computations, for instance calculating a diverse working and
   protected path do not share common network points, would need to
   synchronize the computations in order to increase the probability of
   meeting the working and protected path disjoint objective and
   network resource optimization objective. When a PCE computes
   multiple sets of dependent path computation requests concurrently,
   it is required to use Synchronization VECtor (SVEC) list for
   association among the sets of dependent path computation requests.
   SVEC is also applicable to end-to-end diverse path computation
   across multiple domains. This document describes the usage of SVECs
   in the SVEC list and diverse path computation guideline, for the
   synchronized computation of dependent paths.

1. Terminology

   This document uses PCE terminology defined in [RFC4655],[RFC4875],
   and [RFC5440].

   GCO (Global Concurrent Optimization): A concurrent path computation
   application, defined in [RFC5557], where a set of TE paths is
   computed concurrently in order to efficiently utilize network
   resources.

   Associated SVECs: A group of multiple SVECs (Synchronization
   VECtors), defined in this document, to indicate a set of
   synchronized or concurrent path computations.

   VSPT: Virtual Shortest Path Tree defined in [RFC5441].

   Disjoint VSPT : A set of VSPTs, defined in this document, to
   indicate a set of virtual diverse path tree.



2. Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the specifications for PCEP (Path Computation
   Element communication Protocol). PCEP facilitates the communication
   between a Path Computation Client(PCC) and a Path Computation
   Element (PCE), or between two PCEs based on PCE architecture
   [RFC4655]. PCEP interactions include path computation requests and
   path computation replies.

   [RFC5557] specifies the Global Concurrent (GCO) path computation
   mechanism.  The GCO application provides the capability to re-
   optimize a set of service within the network, in order to maximize
   efficient use of network resources. A single or set of objective
   functions (OFs) can be applied to a GCO. To compute a set of such
   traffic-engineered paths for the GCO application, PCEP supports the
   synchronous and dependent path computation requests required in
   [RFC4657]. When a PCC or PCE sends such path computation requests to
   a PCE, Synchronization VECtor (SVEC) allows the PCC or PCE to
   specify a list of multiple path computation requests that must be

   synchronized along with a potential dependency. [RFC5440] defines
   two synchronous path computation modes using SVEC.

    o  Bundle of a set of independent and synchronized path computation
   requests,

    o  Bundle of a set of dependent and synchronized path computation
   requests.

   These are exclusive modes in a single SVEC. If one of the dependency
   flags (i.e. Node, Link or Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLG) diverse
   flags) in a SVEC is set, the SVEC indicates a set of synchronous
   path computation requests with a dependency. In order to be
   synchronized among multiple sets of path computation requests with a
   dependency, it is necessary to use other SVECs.

   It is important for the PCE, when performing path computations, to
   synchronize any path computation requests with a dependency. For
   example, consider a protected end-to-end service. Two diverse path
   computation requests are needed to compute the disjointed working
   and protected paths. If the diverse path requests are computed
   sequentially, fulfillment of the initial diverse path computation
   without consideration of the second diverse path computation and
   disjoint constraint may result in the PCE providing sub-optimal
   results for the second one, or may fail to meet the disjoint
   requirement altogether.

   Additionally, SVEC can be applied to end-to-end diverse path
   computation that traverses multiple domains. [RFC5441] describes two
   approaches, synchronous (i.e. simultaneous) and 2-step approaches,
   for the end-to-end diverse path computation across a chain of
   domains. The path computation procedure is specified for the 2-step
   approaches in [RFC5521], but no guidelines are provided for a
   synchronous approach.

   This document defines the handling of synchronous path computation
   for PCE and multiple set of path computation request with a
   dependency, based on the PCE architecture [RFC4655]. The following
   scenarios are specifically described:

     o  Single domain, single PCE, dependent and synchronized path
   computation request.

   o  Single domain, multiple-PCE, dependent and synchronized path
   computation request.

     o  Multi-domain, dependent and synchronized path computation
   request, including end-to-end diverse path computation.

   The association among multiple SVECs for multiple sets of
   synchronized dependent path computation and disjoint VSPT encoding
   rule for end-to-end diverse path computation across domains are also
   described in this document. Path computation algorithms for these
   path computation scenarios are out of scope in this document.

   The SVEC association and the disjoint VSPT described in this
   document do not require any extension to PCEP message and object
   formats, when computing a GCO for multiple or end-to-end diverse
   paths. In addition, the use of multiple SVECs is not restricted to
   only SRLG, Node and Link diversity currently defined in the SVEC
   object [RFC5440], but is also available for other dependent path
   computation requests.

   The SVEC association and disjoint VSPT are available to both
   multiple PCE path computations as well as a single PCE path
   computation.



3. SVEC association scenarios

   This section clarifies several path computation scenarios, in which
   SVEC association can be applied. Also, any combination of scenarios
   described in this section could be applicable.

3.1. Synchronized computation for diverse path requests

   When computing two or more point-to-point diverse paths, a PCE may
   compute these diverse paths concurrently, in order to increase the
   probability of meeting primary and secondary path disjoint objective
   and network resource optimization objective.

   Two scenarios can be considered for the SVEC association of point-
   to-point diverse paths.

   o Two or more end-to-end diverse paths

   When concurrent path computation of two or more end-to-end diverse
   paths is requested, SVEC association is needed among diverse path
   requests. Note here that each diverse path request consists of
   primary, secondary, and tertiary and beyond path requests, in which
   all path requests are grouped with one SVEC association.

Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-pce-pcep-svec-list-02         August 2009


   Example of this scenario: When there are two associated end-to-end
   diverse path requests with primary and secondary, all requests must
   be computed in a synchronized manner.

   o End-to-end primary path and its segmented secondary paths

   When concurrent path computation of an end-to-end primary path and
   several segmented secondary paths is requested, SVEC association is
   needed among primary/segmented secondary-1 request,
   primary/segmented secondary-2 request, and etc.

   In this scenario, we assume that the primary path may be pre-
   computed, which is used for specifying the segment for secondary
   paths. Otherwise, segment for secondary path requests are specified
   in advance, by using XRO and/or IOR constraints in the primary
   request.

3.2. Synchronized computation for point-to-multipoint path requests

   For point-to-multipoint path requests,SVEC association can be
   applied.

   o Two or more point-to-multipoint paths

   If a point-to-multipoint paths request is represented as a set of
   point-to-point paths [ID.pce-p2mp-ext], two or more point-to-
   multipoint path computation requests can be associated for
   concurrent path computation, in order to optimize network resources.

   o point-to-multipoint paths and its secondary paths

     When concurrent path computation of a point-to-multipoint path and
     its point-to-point secondary paths [RFC4875], or a point-to-
     multipoint path and its point-to-multipoint secondary paths is
     requested, SVEC association is needed among these requests. In
     this scenario, we use the same assumption as "end-to-end primary
     path and its segmented secondary paths scenario" in section 3.1



4. SVEC association

   This section describes the associations among SVECs in a SVEC list.

4.1. Associated SVECs

   Associated SVECs mean that there are relationships among multiple
   SVECs. Request-IDs in the SVEC objects are used to indicate the
   association among SVEC objects. If the same request-IDs exist in
   more than two SVECs, this indicates associated SVECs. When
   associating among SVECs, only one request-ID may in the SVEC object
   may be contained in the other SVEC object. This contributes to
   reducing the message size of PCEP request. Even in this case, all of
   the path computation requests are synchronized.

   Below is an example of associated SVECs. In this example, the first
   SVEC is associating the other SVECs, and path computation requests
   from Request-ID#1 to Request-ID#Z must be synchronized.

   <SVEC-list>

       <SVEC> without dependency flags

        Request-ID #1, Request-ID #3, ..., Request-ID #X

       <SVEC> with one or more dependency flags

        Request-ID #1, Request-ID #2

       <SVEC> with one or more dependency flags

        Request-ID #3, Request-ID #4

          ........

       <SVEC> without dependency flag

        Request-ID #X, Request-ID #Y, Request-ID #Z

4.2. Non-associated SVECs

   Non-associated SVECs mean that there are no relationships among
   SVECs. If SVEC objects in PECP request messages do not have the same
   request-ID, the relationship among these SVECs is not associated.
   Below is an example of non-associated SVECs that does not contain
   any same request-IDs.

   <SVEC-list>

      <SVEC> with one or more dependency flags

Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-pce-pcep-svec-list-02         August 2009


        Request-ID #1, Request-ID #2

      <SVEC> with one or more dependency flags

        Request-ID #3, Request-ID #4

          ........

      <SVEC> without dependency flags

        Request-ID #X, Request-ID #Y, Request-ID #Z

5. Processing of SVEC list

5.1. Single PCE, single domain environments

   When PCEP receives PCReq messages with more than two SVEC objects in
   the SVEC list, PCEP has to first check the request-IDs in all SVEC
   objects in order to identify any associations among them. The SVEC
   objects may be received in a single or multiple PCReq message(s). In
   the latter case, the PCE may start a SyncTimer as recommended in
   [RFC5440]. After receiving the whole path computation requests, the
   analysis for associated SVECs has to be started.

   If there are no matching request-IDs in the different SVEC objects,
   these SVEC objects are not associated, and then each set of path
   computation requests in the non-associated SVEC objects has to be
   computed separately.

   If there are matching request-IDs in the different SVEC objects,
   these SVEC objects are associated, and then all path computation
   requests in the associated SVEC objects are treated in a synchronous
   manner for GCO application.

   If the PCE does not have capability to handle the associated SVEC
   objects, it may send a PCErr message with Error-Type="Capability not
   supported".

5.2. Multi-PCE, single domain environments

   Currently no mechanisms exist to manage co-ordination of dependent
   SVEC requests between multiple PCE`s in the same domain. If a PCC
   sends a path computation request to a PCE and then sends a second
   service path computation request, which is required to be disjoint
   from the first service, and this request is sent to a different PCE
   in the domain, no SVEC object correlation function between the PCEs



Nishioka & King       Expires February 28, 2010                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-pce-pcep-svec-list-02         August 2009


   is currently available. Equally, associated SVECs are not sent to
   the different PCEs in the domain.

5.3. Single PCE, multi-domain environments

   When multiple PCEs located in separate domains are used to
   concurrently compute an end-to-end diverse path across multiple
   domains, additional processing may be required. The path computation
   process for the end-to-end diverse path is described in Section 6.

   Furthermore, if the PCReq message contains multiple associated SVEC
   objects and these SVEC objects contain path computation requests
   that will be sent to the next PCE along the path computation chain.
   Intermediate PCEs receiving such PCReq messages may re-construct
   associations among SVEC objects, and then send PCReq messages to
   corresponding PCEs located in neighboring domains. If the associated
   SVECs are re-constructed at the intermediate PCE, the PCE must not
   start path computation until all PCRep messages have been received
   from neighbor PCEs. In addition, it is not recommended that SVEC
   objects coming from different PCReq messages are re-constructed.
   This may contribute to resource optimization from network operator`s
   point of view, but it is unrealistic in the case of multiple PCE
   path computation scenarios.



6. End-to-end diverse path computation

   End-to-end diverse path is a set of primary path and secondary paths,
   which do not share common network resources across domains. To
   compute the end-to-end diverse path, the BRPC procedure can be used.
   [RFC5441] describes two approaches, synchronous (i.e. simultaneous)
   and 2-step approaches, for the end-to-end diverse path computation
   across a chain of domains. The 2-step approach is described in
   [RFC5521]. This section provides how to compute end-to-end diverse
   path in the synchronous approach.

6.1. Disjoint VSPT

   The BRPC procedure constructs a VSPT (virtual shortest path tree) to
   inform the enquiring PCE of potential paths to the destination node.

   In the end-to-end diverse path computation, disjoint information
   among the potential paths must be preserved in the VSPT to ensure
   end-to-end disjoint path. In order to preserve disjoint information,
   disjoint VSPTs are sent in the PCEP PCRep message.

Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-pce-pcep-svec-list-02         August 2009


   A definition of the disjoint VSPT is a collection of VSPTs, in which
   each VSPT contains a potential set of primary and secondary paths.

   Figure-1 shows an example network. Here, transit nodes in domains
   are not depicted, and PCE1 and PCE2 may be located in boarder nodes.
   In this network, there are three VSPTs for the potential set of
   diverse paths shown in Figure 2, when the primary path and secondary
   path are requested from S1 to D1. These VSPTs consist of a disjoint
   VSPT, which is replied to PCE1. When receiving the disjoint VSPT,
   PCE1 recognizes the disjoint request and disjoint VSPT information.
   PCE1 will then continue to process the request and compute the
   diverse path using the BRPC procedure [RFC5441]. The detail encoding
   for the disjoint VSPT is described in Section 6.2.

6.2. Disjoint VSPT encoding

   Encoding for disjoint VSPT follows the definition of PCEP message
   encoding in [RFC5440].

   PCEP PCRep message returns a disjoint VSPT as <path list> for each
   RP object. The order of <path> in <path list> among <responses>
   implies a set of primary EROs and secondary EROs.

   A PCE sending PCRep with a disjoint VSPT can reply with a partial
   disjoint VSPT based on its network operation policy, but the order
   of <path> in <path list> must be aligned correctly.

   If confidentiality is required between domains, path key mechanism
   defined in [RFC5520] is used for a disjoint VSPT.

   Detail disjoint VSPT encoding in Figure-2 is shown below, when a
   primary path and a secondary path are requested from S1 to D1.

   o Request ID #1 (Primary)

       - ERO1 BR4(TE route ID)- ...-D1(TE-Router ID)  [for VSPT1]

       - ERO2 BR4(TE route ID)- ...-D1(TE-Router ID)  [for VSPT2]

   - ERO3 BR5(TE route ID)- ...-D1(TE-Router ID)  [for VSPT3]

   O Request ID #2 (Secondary)

   - ERO4 BR5(TE route ID)- ...-D1(TE-Router ID)  [for VSPT1]

   - ERO5 BR6(TE route ID)- ...-D1(TE-Router ID)  [for VSPT2]

   - ERO6 BR6(TE route ID)- ...-D1(TE-Router ID)  [for VSPT2]



6.3. Path computation procedure

   For end-to-end diverse path computation, the same mode of operation
   as BRPC procedure can be applied (i.e. Step 1 to Step n in Section
   4.2 [RFC5441]). During this procedure, a question is how to
   recognize disjoint VSPTs.

   The recognition of disjoint VSPT is achieved by the PCE sending
   PCreq to its neighbor PCE which maintains the path computation

   request (PCReq) information. If PCreq has one or more SVEC object(s)
   with the appropriate diverse flags, the received PCrep will contain
   the disjoint VSPT. If not, the received VSTP is a normal VSPT based
   on the shortest path computation.

   Note that the PCE will apply a suitable algorithm for computing
   disjoint VSPT. The selection and application of the appropriate
   algorithm is out of scope in this draft.



7. Manageability considerations

   This section describes manageability considerations specified in
   [ID.pce-mngabl-reqs].

7.1. Control of Function and Policy

   In addition to [RFC5440], PCEP implementation should allow the
   configuration of association among SVECs on PCCs.

   o  the capability to configure SVEC association.

7.2. Information and Data Models, e.g. MIB modules

   There are no additional parameters for MIB modules.

7.3. Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   The associated SVEC in this document allows PCEs to compute optimal
   sets of diverse path. This type of path computation may require more
   time to obtain its results. Therefore, it is recommended for PCEP to
   support PCE monitoring mechanism specified in [ID.pce-monitor].

7.4. Verifying Correct Operation

   [RFC5440] provides the sufficient descriptions for this document. So,
   there are no additional considerations.

7.5. Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components

   This document does not require any other protocol and functional
   components.

7.6. Impact on Network Operation

   [RFC5440] provides the sufficient descriptions for this document. So,
   there are no additional considerations.



8. Security Considerations

   This document defines the usage of SVEC list, and does not have any
   extensions for PCEP protocol. Therefore the security of this
   document depends on that of PCEP protocol.



9. IANA Considerations

   This document has no specific extension for PCEP messages, objects
   and its parameters and does not require any registry assignment.
