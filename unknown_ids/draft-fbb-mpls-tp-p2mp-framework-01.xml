    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile

      general architecture of the Transport Profile, as well as those
      aspects specific to point-to-point transport paths.  The purpose of
      this document is to define the elements and functions of the MPLS-TP

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>The point-to-multipoint connectivity provided by an MPLS-TP
        network is based on the point-to-multipoint connectivity provided
        by MPLS networks.  MPLS TE-LSP support is discussed in <xref
        target="RFC4875" /> and <xref target="RFC5332" />, and PW support
        is being developed based on <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-requirements" /> and <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpms-frmwk-requirements" />.  MPLS-TP
        point-to-multipoint connectivity is analogous to that provided by
        traditional transport technologies such as Optical Transport
        Network (OTN) point-to-multipoint [ref?] and optical
        drop-and-continue [ref?], and thus supports the same class of
        traditional applications.</t>

    <section title="MPLS Transport Profile Point-to-Multipoint Requirements">
      <t>The requirements for MPLS-TP are specified in <xref
      target="RFC5654"></xref>, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements"></xref>, and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-req"></xref>. This section provides a
      brief summary of point-to-multipoint transport requirements as set
      out in those documents; the reader is referred to the documents
      themselves for the definitive and complete list of requirements.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>MPLS-TP must support unidirectional point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
        transport paths.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP must support traffic-engineered point-to-multipoint
        transport paths.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP must be capable of using P2MP server (sub)layer
        capabilities as well as P2P server (sub)layer capabilities when
        supporting P2MP MPLS-TP transport paths.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane must support establishing all the
        connectivity patterns defined for the MPLS-TP data plane (i.e.,
        unidirectional P2P, associated bidirectional P2P, co-routed
        bidirectional P2P, unidirectional P2MP) including configuration of
        protection functions and any associated maintenance functions.</t>

        <t>Recovery techniques used for P2P and P2MP should be identical
        to simplify implementation and operation.</t>

        <t>Unidirectional 1+1 and 1:n protection for P2MP connectivity
        must be supported.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP recovery in a ring must protect unidirectional P2MP
        transport paths.</t>
      </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="arch" title="Architecture">
      <t>The overall architecture of the MPLS Transport Profile is defined
      in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-framework" />.  The architecture
      for point-to-multipoint MPLS-TP comprises the following additional
      elements and functions:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Unidirectional point-to-multipoint Label Switched Paths
        (LSPs)</t>

        <t>Unidirectional point-to-multipoint pseudowires (PWs)</t>

        <t>Optional point-to-multipoint LSP and PW control planes</t>

        <t>Survivability, network management, and Operations,
        Administration and Maintenance (OAM) functions for
        point-to-multipoint PWs and LSPs</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>The following subsections summarise the encapsulation and
      forwarding of point-to-multipoint traffic within an MPLS-TP network,
      and the encapsulation options for delivery of traffic to and from
      MPLS-TP Customer Edge devices when the network is providing a packet
      transport service.</t>

      <section title="MPLS-TP Encapsulation and Forwarding">
        <t>Packet encapsulation and forwarding for MPLS-TP
        point-to-multipoint LSPs is identical to that for MPLS-TE
        point-to-multipoint LSPs.  MPLS-TE point-to-multipoint LSPs were
        introduced in <xref target="RFC4875" /> and the related data-plane
        behaviour was further clarified in <xref target="RFC5332" />.
        MPLS-TP allows for both upstream-assigned and downstream-assigned
        labels for use with point-to-multipoint LSPs.</t>

        <t>Packet encapsulation and forwarding for point-to-multipoint PWs
        is currently being defined by the PWE3 Working Group <xref
