  Proposal for an extension to RTCP Receiver Report for Feedback Storm
                              Suppression
             draft-wu-avt-retransmission-supression-rtp-02

Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to the RTCP messages defined in
   the Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF) designed to allow
   intermediate node of the network side to suppress the feedback
   implosion from the receivers.  An example of feedback implosion is
   NACK storm, i.e., a large number of RTCP NACK messages used to
   request retransmission of the missing packets going to the same media
   sender.  The Feedback Storm Suppression receiver report is used to
   carry the information regarding feedback suppression early indication
   events to the receiver before the receiver detects an original packet
   loss and all the packet loss repair methods are applied and filtering
   of unnecessary feedback messages when the receivers have already send
   out packet loss requests.  By using feedback Suppression message
   together with filter mechanism, the delay for the receiver to recover
   from the packet loss can be reduced and the risk of increasing
   network congestion can be mitigated.  This document also registers
   two new RTCP receiver reports for Feedback Storm Suppression.

Internet-Draft         Feedback Storm Suppression              June 2010


1.  Introduction

   RTP retransmission is an effective packet loss recovery technique for
   real-time applications with relaxed delay bounds [RFC4588],e.g.,
   streaming media.  The conventional RTCP feedback (NACK) message which
   conveys the RTP sequence number of the lost packets can be used to
   request the sender to compensate the missing RTP packets based on the
   RTP sequence number of these packets [RFC4585].

   However, in lots of multicast environments, packet loss occurs in the
   upstream link or downstream aggregate link of the intermediate
   network element (e.g., Retransmission server, Distribution Source)
   due to oversaturated network link, faulty networking hardware or
   corrupted packets rejected in-transit.  It may result in NACK
   implosion targeting at the same sender, i.e., massive NACK request to
   the same multicast sender for retransmission of the same RTP packets
   which is also known as "NACK storm" described in [DVB-IPTV]To
   increase the robustness to the loss of a NACK or of a retransmission
   packet, a receiver may also send multiple NACKs for the same packet
   which may aggravate the NACK implosion.

   A similar use case is video Fast Update request storm occurs in the
   conversational multimedia scenarios.  In this case, packet loss may
   happen in the upstream link of intermediate network element like
   Multipoint Control Unit(MCU) which results in massive fast update
   request (i.e., Full Intra Request(FIR) described in [RFC5104]) from
   receivers to the same media sender.

   As these feedback storms progress (e.g., NACK implosion or Fast
   update implosion), the network may be overwhelmed with constant
   feedback traffic, in the worsening case, RTCP feedback storm poses a
   risk of increasing network congestion, with excessive traffic and
   degrading network performance, this can eventually lead to a complete
   loss of network connectivity as such feedback packets proliferate,
   the network may become unusable.

   In order to solve this, the current text in [RFC5760] allows the
   distribution source to filter out the NACK messages while this
   document propose an option to let the receivers know that Feedback
   for packet loss is not needed in the specified cases. i.e.,
   generating one new generic RTCP receiver report message, which
   reflects the packet receipt/loss events and feedback suppression
   early indication events before the receiver detects an original
   packet loss and all the packet loss repair methods are applied.

   This new RTCP receiver report, which we refer to as Feedback Storm
   Suppression, indicates suppressing feedback request for the packet
   loss(e.g., request retransmission of lost packets or request decoder

   refresh point) before the receiver sends a request to the media
   sender for the missing packet.  In order to detect the original
   packet loss in the upstream direction before the receivers perceive
   it, the intermediate node of network side located between the media
   sender and receiver may monitor a certain packet loss by checking the
   sequence number consistency of the original multicast packets or
   configuring upstream RTP client or a small subset of RTP receivers to
   act as immediate reporters described in [DVB-IPTV].  Also this
   intermediate node should take into account such factors as the
   tolerable application delay, the network environment, and the media
   type.  When the packet loss is detected and initial latency is
   tolerable, in the upstream direction towards the sender, the
   intermediate node may ask for retransmission of the lost packet from
   the sender or ask for the correct decoder refresh point, meanwhile,
   in the downstream direction from the sender, the intermediate node
   may convey Feedback Suppression Indication to all the receivers
   concerned to indicate that the receiver should not to transmit
   feedback messages.  When the sender receives the request from the
   intermediate node, the sender resends the missing packets to the
   receiver via RTP using retransmission payload format [RFC4588]or a
   new refresh point for FIR Initiator [RFC5104]

   Similar to RTCP NACK, the Feedback Storm Suppression also conveys the
   packet receipt/loss events at the packet level and considers missing
   packets as unrepaired.  But different from RTCP NACK, the Feedback
   Storm Suppression can only be forwarded by the intermediate node to
   the receivers impacted by packet loss or generated directly at the
   intermediate node and sent to the corresponding receivers.

   Note that the feedback storm suppression should collectively work
   together with feedback to repair the lost source packets.  Thus, the
   delay for the receiver to recover from the packet loss can be reduced
   and the risk of increasing network congestion can be mitigated or
   diminished.  The receiver may send a Feedback message before
   receiving the indication but will not need to resend the Feedback
   message after receiving the indication.  Also the idea of Feedback
   Storm Suppression can be further extended when a distributed content
   distribution network (CDN) are considered.  That is to say several
   intermediate node and media senders may constitute hierarchical
   model.  In this distributed content distribution environment, the
   Feedback Storm Suppression not only can be used to suppress all the
   receivers behind itself not to send packet loss request but also
   suppress the neighboring node not to send packet loss request for the
   missing packets via unicast.  How the neighboring node is discovered
   is beyond scope of this document.

   This document registers two new RTCP receiver report messages for
   Feedback Storm Suppression.  Applications that are employing one or

   more loss-repair methods MAY use feedback Storm Suppression together
   with these loss-repair methods for every packet they receive or for a
   set of specific packets they have received.

   Note: The draft focus on the SSM case.  The video MCU has similar
   issue with packet loss since the MCU need to multi-unicast the stream
   from the source to all participants and may have the same problem
   when packets are lost between the source and the MCU.  If the
   consensus is that the only relevant use case is the NACK implosion we
   can look at adding semantics to NACK for this case.  Otherwise we can
   expand the text on the video packet loss case.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Upstream RTP Client:

      The RTP Client located in the upstream from the distribution
      source as described in [DVB-IPTV].  This Client is able to detect
      upstream packet loss impacting all the RTP receivers serviced by
      the distribution source and receiving SSM service.
   Immediate reporting RTP Client:

      The RTP Client located in the downstream aggregate link from the
      distribution source as described in [DVB-IPTV].  This Client is
      able to detect downstream packet loss in the aggregate link
      impacting all the RTP receivers serviced by the distribution
      source and receiving SSM service.
   Loss Reporter:

      The Loss Reporter is one logical function which is used to detect
      the packet loss at the RTP layer and report it to the distribution
      source.  The function of the loss reporter may be collocated or
      integrated in the same entity.  In this case, for a session
      defined as having a Distribution Source A, on ports n for the RTP
      channel and k for the RTCP channel, the unicast RTCP Feedback
      Target is identified by an IP address of Distribution Source A on
      port k.  The loss reporter MAY also be implemented in one or more
      entities different from the Distribution Source.  In this case,
      the loss reporter may be an upstream RTP client or immediate
      reporting RTP client located in the downstream aggregate link of
      distribution source.

3.  Basic Operation

   As described in [RFC5760], one or more Media Senders send RTP packets
   to the Distribution Source.  The Distribution Source relays the RTP
   packets to the receivers using a source-specific multicast
   arrangement.  In case of upstream packet loss or downstream aggregate
   link packet loss, the Loss reporter located in the upstream link or
   downstream aggregate link may send extended receiver report described
   in section 6 indicating the packet loss to the distribution source.
   And then the distribution source creates packet loss suppression
   report and transmits it to all the RTP receivers, using source-
   specific multicast.  The distribution source can ask for
   retransmission of the lost packets from the media sender on behalf of
   all the RTP receivers.  Upon receiving the lost packet, the
   distribution source forwards them to all the receivers which are
   impacted by packet loss.

   When the loss reporter(s) are collocated with distribution source,
   redistribution of packet loss report is trivial.  In such case, loss
   reporter should detect contiguous packet loss coming from upstream
   link by checking sequence number of RTP packets.  Also the loss
   reporter may detect contiguous packet loss occurring in the
   collocated distribution source using the similar method mentioned
   above.  When the loss reporter(s) are physically and(or)
   topologically distinct from distribution source, each loss reporter
   MUST create packet loss report at the RTP layer and send it to the
   distribution source.  The loss reporters may be upstream client or
   downstream immediate reporter who is dedicated to detect and report
   packet loss.

   The Distribution Source MUST be able to communicate with all group
   members in order for either mechanism to work.  The general
   architecture is displayed below in Figure 1

                Transport from the Loss Reporter to the Distribution
                Source is via unicast feedback if they are not
                co-located.

                       Figure 1: System Architecture

   In this figure, we assume the distribution source is separated from a
   particular media sender and the Feedback Target is collocated with
   Distribution source.  The communication between the Media sender and
   the distribution source is compliant with the ways described in
   [RFC5760].  Also besides following the configuration information
   described in [RFC5760], the additional configuration information
   should be supplied as follows:

   o  The Loss Reporters know the addresses of their respectively
      responsible Feedback Targets.

   As outlined in the [RFC5760], there are two Unicast Feedback models
   that are used for reporting, i.e., Simple Feedback model and
   Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model.  The RTCP receiver report
   extension specified in the section 6 of this document will work in
   both two Feedback models.

4.  Simple Feedback Model

   In the simple Feedback Model, the Loss reporter(s) are disjoint from
   distribution source.  In this case, the upstream client or immediate
   reporting receiver may be chosen as the loss reporter.  Also in this
   model, the distribution source will include the support for
   retransmission as part of the offered SDP and will expect such
   support from the Media Sender

   As one dedicated receiver for packet loss reporting, the Loss
   reporter MUST listen on the RTP channel for data.  When the Loss
   reporter observes RTP packets from a Media Sender are not consecutive
   by checking the sequence number of packets, the Loss reporter MUST
   use the same packet types as traditional RTCP feedback described in
   [RFC3550]and generate Receiver Feedback Report with information on
   the RTP sequence number of the lost packets and suppression early
   indication event.  When a receiver is eligible to transmit, it MUST
   send this Report packet to the distribution source via unicast
   feedback.

   The Distribution Source (unicast Feedback Target) MUST listen for
   unicast RTCP data sent to the RTCP port.  Upon receiving the unicast
   Receiver Feedback Report packet from the loss reporter, the
   Distribution Source MUST forward it to the group on the multicast
   RTCP channel.  Every RTCP packet from each Loss reporter MUST be
   reflected individually.  If the loss reporter is part of group, the
   Distribution source Must filter this packet out and not forward it
   back to this loss reporter.

   If there are a couple of loss reporters looking at the same RTP
   stream, then the loss may be identified by all and they will all send
   requests for the same packet loss.  In this case, the distribution
   source MUST filter the duplicated packet loss request out and only
   forward one copy of the receiver Feedback report packet from the
   first loss reporter to the group impacted by packet loss.

   Because this unicast Receiver Feedback Report is used to let the
   receivers/hosts know that Feedback for packet loss is not needed and
   should not be sent to the media sender(s).  If the Media Sender(s)
   are part of the SSM group for RTCP packet reflection, the
   Distribution Source MUST filter this packet out.  If the Media
   Sender(s) are not part of the SSM group for RTCP packet, the
   Distribution Source MUST not forward this RTCP packets received from
   the receivers to the Media Sender(s).

   When the host receives the RTCP packet, if the host understands this
   message it will not send packet loss request (e.g., NACK) for the
   missing packets reported in the message and will accept a

   retransmission stream transmitted from the Distribution Source.  If
   it did not understand this new message, the host may send packet loss
   request(e.g., NACK messages) to the specified media sender.  When the
   distribution source receives the packet loss request from the hosts,
   the distribution source MUST filter it out until the Retransmission
   stream is ready in the Distribution Source.


5.  Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model

   In the distribution source feedback summary model, the distribution
   source will include the support for retransmission as part of the
   offered SDP and will expect such support from the Media Sender, also
   the Loss reporter instance may be integrated in the distribution
   source or may be separated from the distribution source.  In some
   cases, several loss reporter instances for the same session can exist
   at the same time, e.g., one loss reporter instance (loss reporter A)
   is implemented in the upstream client A, one loss reporter instance
   (loss reporter B) is implemented in the upstream client B, another
   loss reporter instance for the same session (loss reporter C) is
   integrated in the distribution source.  In this section, we focus on
   this generic case to discuss the distribution Source Feedback Summary
   Model.

   The Loss reporter A and the Loss reporter B MUST listen on the RTP
   channel for data.  When the Loss reporter observes RTP packets from a
   Media Sender are not consecutive by checking the sequence number of
   packets, the loss reporter generates NACK message described in
   [RFC4585] or generates the new Receiver Feedback Report packet
   described in the section 6, and then send either of them to the
   distribution source via unicast feedback.

   The Distribution Source (unicast Feedback Target) MUST listen for
   unicast RTCP data sent to the RTCP port.  Upon receiving the unicast
   Receiver Feedback Report packet from the loss reporter, the
   distribution source needs to filter them out, i.e., identify these
   unicast RTCP packets coming from the Dedicated receivers (i.e.,Loss
   Reporter A and Loss Reporter B)based on the IP address of loss
   reporters or dedicated RTCP port for loss report, then summarize the
   information received from all the Receiver Feedback Reports generated
   by the Dedicated receivers together with the information generated by
   the loss reporter integrated in the distribution source and then
   create the summary report to include these information.  In order to
   reduce the processing load at the distribution source, the individual
   instance of Loss Reporter may provide preliminary summarization
   report.

   In some case, the distribution source may receive RTCP NACK messages



Wu, et al.              Expires December 12, 2010              [Page 10]

   from the receivers behind the Distribution Source before the
   distribution source detects the packet loss which may cause potential
   Feedback implosion.  In such case, the distribution source may filter
   them out if it already sent a packet loss request for the missing
   packet to the media sender.  When the distribution source confirms
   packet loss reported by the receiver, the distribution source
   generates the summary report to include the packet loss information
   from the corresponding receiver (e.g., upstream client or loss
   reporter).

   The distribution source may send this new RTCP summary report
   described in the section 6 to the group on the multicast RTCP channel
   and in the meanwhile sending a packet loss request to the media
   sender.

   If the loss reporter is part of group, the Distribution source MUST
   not send the summary report back to this loss reporter.

   If there are a couple of loss reporters looking at the same RTP
   stream, then the loss may be identified by all and they will all send
   requests for the same packet loss.  In this case, the distribution
   source MUST filter out the duplicated information from various loss
   reporters and only append one copy of such information to the summary
   report.

   When the host receives the RTCP packet, if the host understands this
   message it will not send packet loss request (e.g., NACK) for the
   missing packets reported in the message and will accept a
   retransmission stream transmitted from the Distribution Source.  If
   it did not understand this new message, the host may send packet loss
   request(e.g., NACK messages) to the specified media sender.  When the
   distribution source receives the packet loss request from the hosts,
   the distribution source MUST filter it out until the Retransmission
   stream is ready in the Distribution Source.

7.  SDP Signaling

   A new feedback value "fss" needs to be defined for the Feedback Storm
   Suppression message to be used with Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) [RFC4566] using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC4585].

   The "fss" feedback value SHOULD be used with parameters that indicate
   the feedback suppression supported.  In this document, we define two
   such parameters, namely:

   o  "fsei" denotes support of fir suppression early indication (fsei).

   o  "nsei" denotes support of NACK suppression early indication

   In the ABNF for rtcp-fb-val defined in [RFC4585], there is a
   placeholder called rtcp-fb-id to define new feedback types. "fss" is
   defined as a new feedback type in this document, and the ABNF for the
   parameters for fss is defined here (please refer to section 4.2 of
   [RFC4585] for complete ABNF syntax).

   Refer to Section 4.2 of [RFC4585] for a detailed description and the
   full syntax of the "rtcp-fb" attribute.


8.  IANA Consideration

   New feedback type and New parameters for RTCP FSS receiver feedback
   report are subject to IANA registration.  For general guidelines on
   IANA considerations for RTCP feedback, refer to [RFC4585].

   This document assigns one new feedback type value x in the RTCP
   receiver feedback report registry to "Feedback Storm Suppression"
   with the following registrations format:

                  Name:            FSS
                  Long Name:       Feedback Storm Suppression
                  Value:           TBD
                  Reference:       This document.

   This document also assigns the parameter value y in the RTCP FSS
   receiver feedback report Registry to "NACK Suppression Early
   Indication ", with the following registrations format:

                Name:           NSEI
                Long name:      NACK Suppression Early Indication
                Value:          TBD
                Reference:      this document.

   This document also assigns the parameter value z in the RTCP FSS
   receiver feedback report Registry to "FIR Suppression Early
   Indication ", with the following registrations format:

                Name:           FSEI
                Long name:      FIR Suppression Early Indication
                Value:          TBD

Appendix A.  Example scenarios for Retransmission Storm Suppression

A.1.  Scenario 1: One or more media sender,One distribution source

   The general architecture for scenario 1 is displayed below in
   Figure 4.  In this architecture, one or more Media Senders send RTP
   packets to the RTP Receivers through the same Distribution Source.
   The Distribution Source relays the RTP packets to the receivers using
   a source-specific multicast channel.  In the reverse direction, the
   receivers transmit RTCP packets via unicast to the distribution
   source.  The Distribution Source in turn relays RTCP packets to the
   media sender and then transmits the RTCP packets back to the
   receivers, using source-specific multicast.  When packet loss happens
   in the upstream link or downstream aggregate link of distribution
   source, it may result in massive retransmission request for the same
   RTP packets from all the receivers using RTCP NACK to the same
   multicast sender.  We refer to it as Retransmission Storm.

      Figure 5: One media sender, Two distribution sources in cascade

   The general architecture for scenario 2 is displayed below in
   Figure 5.  In this architecture, One media sender passes through two
   distribution source in cascading and sends RTP packets to all the RTP
   receivers.  When packet loss happens in the upstream link or
   downstream aggregate link of distribution source1, it may result in
   massive retransmission request for the same RTP packets from all the
   receivers using RTCP NACK to the same multicast sender.  We refer to
   it as Retransmission Storm.  In this case, the distribution source 2
   can be taken as one special RTP receiver located in the downstream
   direction of distribution source 1.

A.3.  Scenario 3:One media sender, Two distribution sources in parallel

   The general architecture for scenario 3 is displayed below in
   Figure 6.  In this architecture, one media sender and two
   Distribution source constitute one hierarchical tree model.  In this
   model, one Media Senders send RTP packets to all the RTP receivers
   through two different path respectively.  When packet loss happens in
   the upstream link or downstream aggregate link of distribution
   source, it may result in massive retransmission request for the same
   RTP packets from all the receivers using RTCP NACK to the same
   multicast sender.  We refer to it as Retransmission Storm.

Appendix B.  Applicability of Feedback Storm Suppression

   This document defines new RTCP Receiver feedback Report, which we
   refer to as Feedback Storm Suppression to deal with Retransmission
   Storm mentioned above.  Here we give two examples to show how this
   new RTCP receiver feedback report is applied into three scenarios
   described in Appendix A for Retransmission Storm Suppression.

   Applicability of Retransmission Storm Suppression in Scenario 1
   described in Figure 4 is shown in the Figure 7.  In this figure, the
   distribution source detect the packet loss before the receiver
   perceive it and ask for retransmission of the missing packets from
   the media sender, in the meanwhile, the distribution source transmits
   the RTCP Retransmission Storm Suppression Indication back to the
   receivers using source-specific multicast channel.  In this way, the
   delay for the receiver to recover from the packet loss can be reduced
   and the risk of increasing network congestion can be mitigated.

     Figure 7: Applicability of Feedback Suppression Early Indication

   Applicability of Feedback Storm Suppression in Scenario 2 or 3
   described in Figure 5 and Figure 6 is shown in the Figure 8.  The
   procedure in the Figure 8 is similar to the one in the figure
   Figure 7.  The only difference is distribution source should not only
   notify all the receiver behind itself not to send NACK but also
   propagate the retransmission suppression indication to the
   neighboring distribution sources.  In this way, all the receivers
   behind all the neighboring distribution source can avoid sending
   massive retransmission request to the media sender.
