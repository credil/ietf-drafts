Abstract

   This document describes a general and flexible TLV (type-length-value
   structure) for representing cryptographic signatures as well as
   timestamps, using the generalized MANET packet/message format
   [RFC5444].  It defines two Message TLVs and two Packet TLVs, for
   affixing a cryptographic signature and a timestamp to a packet and
   message, respectively.

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV         July 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document:

   o  specifies two TLVs for carrying cryptographic signatures and
      timestamps in packets and messages as defined by [RFC5444],

   o  requests IANA allocations for these Packet and Message TLVs from
      the 0-127 message TLV range and the 0-128 Packet TLV range from
      [RFC5444],

   o  describes how cryptographic signatures are calculated, taking into
      account the mutable message header fields (<msg-hop-limit> and
      <msg-hop-count>) for messages where these fields are present,

   o  requests creation of two IANA registries for recording code points
      for hash function and signature calculation, respectively.

   This document does not stipulate how to sign, validate, or encrypt
   messages.  A specification of a routing protocol, using the security
   representation of this document, MUST specify appropriate
   interpretation of the TLVs.  This document does also not promote a
   single algorithm for signature calculation or a single hash function,
   but rather establishes IANA registries for such.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC5444].
   Additionally, it defines the following terminology:

   o  Hash-Function

         A hash function is an algorithm that takes a message of any
         length as input and produces a fixed-length string as output.
         Hash functions are used in cryptography for authentication and
         message integrity.

   o  Signature:

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV         July 2009


         A secure hash of the entire message is encrypted using the
         signer's private key, so that any change to the document will
         invalidate the signature and in order to prove that the message
         originates from the claimed sender.

   o  Timestamp

         The timestamp indicates the time when a signature has been
         created.  This information can be useful to determine the
         "freshness" of the signed message.  "Old" messages can indicate
         replayed messages.


3.  Applicability Statement

   The packet and message format defined in [RFC5444] accords MANET
   routing protocols using this format the ability to carry additional
   information in control messages, through inclusion of TLVs.
   Information so included in a control message MAY be used by the
   routing protocol, or an extension of the routing protocol, according
   to its specification.

   This document specifies how to calculate a cryptographic signature
   for a packet or message, as specified in [RFC5444], specifically how
   to treat "mutable" fields (<msg-hop-count> and <msg-hop-limit>) in
   the message header such that the resulting signature can be correctly
   verified by any recipient, and how to include this signature, and
   other relevant information, by way of TLVs.  A MANET routing protocol
   specification, or an extension of a MANET routing protocol
   specification, MAY use such included cryptographic signatures for,
   for example, rejecting messages where signature verification fails.

   Basic MANET routing protocol specifications are often "oblivious to
   security", however have a clause allowing a control message to be
   rejected as "badly formed" prior to it being processed or forwarded.
   Protocols such as [NHDP] and [OLSRv2] both recognize external reasons
   (such as failure to verify a signature) as being reasons for
   rejecting a message as "badly formed".  This architecture is the
   result of the observation that with respect to security in MANETs,
   "one size rarely fits all" and that MANET routing protocol deployment
   domains have varying security requirements ranging from "unbreakable"
   to "virtually none".  The virtue of this approach is that MANET
   routing protocol specifications (and implementations) can remain
   "generic", with extensions providing proper deployment-domain
   specific security mechanisms.

   The MANET routing protocol "security architecture", in which this
   specification situates itself, can therefore be summarized as



Herberg & Clausen        Expires January 7, 2010                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV         July 2009


   follows:

   o  Security-oblivious MANET routing protocol specification, with a
      clause allowing an extension to reject a message (prior to
      processing/forwarding) as "badly formed".

   o  MANET routing protocol security extensions, rejecting messages as
      "badly formed", as appropriate for a given deployment-domain.

   o  Code-points and an exchange format for information necessary for
      specification of such security extensions.

   This document addresses the last of these issues, by specifying a
   common exchange format for cryptographic signatures.  This document
   also makes reservations from within the Message TLV and Packet TLV
   registries of [RFC5444], to be used (and shared) among MANET routing
   protocol security extensions.  Finally, this document establishes two
   shared IANA registries for code-points for hash functions and
   signature functions.


4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning

   This specification does not describe a protocol, nor does it mandate
   specific node or protocol behavior.  It represents a purely
   syntactical representation of security related information for use
   with [RFC5444] messages and packets, as well as sets up IANA
   registrations and registries.


5.  General SIGNATURE TLV Structure

   The following data structure allows the representation of a
   cryptographic signature, including specification of the appropriate
   hash function and cryptographic algorithm used for calculating the
   signature.  This <signature> data structure is specified, using the
   regular expression syntax of [RFC5444], by:

          <signature> = <hash-function>
                        <cryptographic-algorithm>
                        <signature-value>

   where:

   <hash-function>  is an 8-bit unsigned integer field specifying the
      hash-function according to Table 3.





Herberg & Clausen        Expires January 7, 2010                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV         July 2009


   <cryptographic-algorithm>  is an 8-bit unsigned integer field
      specifying the hash-function according to Table 4.

   <signature-value>  is an unsigned integer field, whose length is
      <tlv-length>-16, and which contains the cryptographic signature.

   The algorithm that is used for calculating the hash function MUST be
   selected from one of those listed in Table 3.  Furthermore, <hash-
   function> MUST correspond to the number in that table assigned by
   IANA.

   The algorithm that is used for calculating the cryptographic
   algorithm MUST be selected from one of those listed in Table 4.
   Furthermore, <cryptographic-algorithm> MUST correspond to the number
   in that table assigned by IANA.


6.  General TIMESTAMP TLV Structure

   The following data structure allows the representation of a
   timestamp.  This <timestamp> data structure is specified, using the
   regular expression syntax of [RFC5444], by:

          <timestamp> = <time-value>

   where:

   <time-value>  is an unsigned integer field, whose length is <tlv-
      length>, and which contains the timestamp.  The value of this
      variable is to be interpreted by the routing protocol as specified
      by the type extension of the TIMESTAMP TLV (refer to Table 2).


7.  Message TLVs

   Two Message TLVs are defined, for including the cryptographic
   signature of a message, and for including the timestamp indicating
   the time at which the cryptographic signature was calculated.

7.1.  Message SIGNATURE TLV

   A Message SIGNATURE TLV is an example of a SIGNATURE TLV as described
   in Section 5.  When determining the <signature-value> for a message,
   the signature is calculated over the entire message, including the
   message header and all Message TLVs (other than Message SIGNATURE
   TLVs), with the following consideration:

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV         July 2009


   o  the fields <msg-hop-limit> and <msg-hop-count> MUST be both
      assumed to have the value 0 (zero).

7.2.  Message TIMESTAMP TLV

   A Message TIMESTAMP TLV is an example of a TIMESTAMP TLV as described
   in Section 6.


8.  Packet TLVs

   Two Packet TLVs are defined, for including the cryptographic
   signature of a packet, and for including the timestamp indicating the
   time at which the cryptographic signature was calculated.

8.1.  Packet SIGNATURE TLV

   A Packet SIGNATURE TLV is an example of a SIGNATURE TLV as described
   in Section 5.  When calculating the <signature-value> for a Packet,
   the signature is calculated over the entire Packet, including the
   packet header, all Packet TLVs (other than Packet SIGNATURE TLVs) and
   all included Messages and their message headers.

8.1.1.  Packet TIMESTAMP TLV

   A Packet TIMESTAMP TLV is an example of a TIMESTAMP TLV as described
   in Section 6.


9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  TLV Registrations

   This specification defines two Message TLV types which must be
   allocated from the 0-127 range of the "Assigned Message TLV Types"
   repository of [RFC5444] as specified in Table 1 and two Packet TLV
   types which must be allocated from the 0-127 range of the "Assigned
   Packet TLV Types" repository of [RFC5444] as specified in Table 2.

   IANA is requested to assign the same numerical value to the Message
   TLV and Packet TLV types with the same name.

9.1.1.  Expert Review: Evaluation Guidelines

   For the registries for TLV type extensions where an Expert Review is
   required, the designated expert SHOULD take the same general
   recommendations into consideration as are specified by [RFC5444].

10.  Security Considerations

   This document does not provide a protocol itself.  However, it
   provides a syntactical component for cryptographic signatures of
   messages and packets as defined in [RFC5444].  It can be used to
   address security issues of a protocol or extension that uses the
   component specified in this document.  As such, it has the same
   security considerations as [RFC5444].

   In addition, a protocol that includes this component MUST specify the
   usage as well as the security that is attained by the cryptographic
   signatures of a message or a packet.

   As an example, a routing protocol that uses this component to reject
   "badly formed" messages if a control message does not contain a valid
   signature, should indicate the security assumption that iff the
   signature is valid, the message is considered valid.  It also should
   indicate the security issues that are counteracted by this measure
   (e.g. link or identity spoofing) as well as the issues that are not
   counteracted (e.g. compromised keys, replay attacks).

Appendix A.  Examples

A.1.  Example Signed Message

   The sample message depicted in Figure 1 is taken from the appendix of
   [RFC5444].  However, a SIGNATURE Message TLV has been added.  It is
   assumed that the SIGNATURE TLV type is lesser than the TLV type of

   the second message TLV (i.e. it comes first in the order of Message
   TLVs).  The TLV has the thasvalue flags set ('1').  The TLV value
   represents a 15 octet long signature of the whole message.
