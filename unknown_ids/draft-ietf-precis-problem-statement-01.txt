                 Stringprep Revision Problem Statement
               draft-ietf-precis-problem-statement-01.txt

Abstract

   Using Unicode codepoints in protocol strings that expect comparison
   with other strings requires preparation of the string that contains
   the Unicode codepoints.  Internationalizing Domain Names in
   Applications (IDNA2003) defined and used Stringprep and Nameprep.
   Other protocols subsequently defined Stringprep profiles.  A new
   approach different from Stringprep and Nameprep is used for a
   revision of IDNA2003 (called IDNA2008).  Other Stringprep profiles
   need to be similarly updated or a replacement of Stringprep needs to
   be designed.  This document outlines the issues to be faced by those
   designing a Stringprep replacement.

Internet-Draft    Stringprep Revision Problem Statement    December 2010


1.  Introduction

   Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA2003) [RFC3490],
   [RFC3491], [RFC3492], [RFC3454] described a mechanism for encoding
   Unicode labels making up Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) as
   standard DNS labels.  The labels were processed using a method called
   Nameprep [RFC3491] and Punycode [RFC3492].  That method was specific
   to IDNA2003, but is generalized as Stringprep [RFC3454].  The general
   mechanism can be used to help other protocols with similar needs, but
   with different constraints than IDNA2003.

   Stringprep defines a framework within which protocols define their
   Stringprep profiles.  Known IETF specifications using Stringprep are
   listed below:
   o  The Nameprep profile [RFC3490] for use in Internationalized Domain
      Names (IDNs);
   o  NFSv4 [RFC3530] and NFSv4.1 [RFC5661];
   o  The iSCSI profile [RFC3722] for use in Internet Small Computer
      Systems Interface (iSCSI) Names;
   o  EAP [RFC3748];
   o  The Nodeprep and Resourceprep profiles [RFC3920] for use in the
      Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), and the XMPP to
      CPIM mapping [RFC3922];
   o  The Policy MIB profile [RFC4011] for use in the Simple Network
      Management Protocol (SNMP);
   o  The SASLprep profile [RFC4013] for use in the Simple
      Authentication and Security Layer (SASL), and SASL itself
      [RFC4422];
   o  TLS [RFC4279];
   o  IMAP4 using SASLprep [RFC4314];
   o  The trace profile [RFC4505] for use with the SASL ANONYMOUS
      mechanism;
   o  The LDAP profile [RFC4518] for use with LDAP [RFC4511] and its
      authentication methods [RFC4513];
   o  Plain SASL using SASLprep [RFC4616];
   o  NNTP using SASLprep [RFC4643];
   o  PKIX subject identification using LDAPprep [RFC4683];
   o  Internet Application Protocol Collation Registry [RFC4790];
   o  SMTP Auth using SASLprep [RFC4954];
   o  POP3 Auth using SASLprep [RFC5034];
   o  TLS SRP using SASLprep [RFC5054];
   o  IRI and URI in XMPP [RFC5122];
   o  PKIX CRL using LDAPprep [RFC5280];
   o  IAX using Nameprep [RFC5456];
   o  SASL SCRAM using SASLprep [RFC5802];
   o  Remote management of Sieve using SASLprep [RFC5804];

   o  The i;unicode-casemap Unicode Collation [RFC5051].

   There turned out to be some difficulties with IDNA2003, documented in
   [RFC4690].  These difficulties led to a new IDN specification, called
   IDNA2008 [RFC5890], [RFC5891], [RFC5892], [RFC5893].  Additional
   background and explanations of the decisions embodied in IDNA2008 is
   presented in [RFC5894].  One of the effects of IDNA2008 is that
   Nameprep and Stringprep are not used at all.  Instead, an algorithm
   based on Unicode properties of codepoints is defined.  That algorithm
   generates a stable and complete table of the supported Unicode
   codepoints.  This algorithm is based on an inclusion-based approach,
   instead of the exclusion-based approach of Stringprep/Nameprep.

   This document lists the shortcomings and issues found by protocols
   listed above that defined Stringprep profiles.  It also lists some
   early conclusions and requirements for a potential replacement of
   Stringprep.


2.  Issues raised during newprep BOF

   During IETF 77, a BOF discussed the current state of the protocols
   that have defined Stringprep profiles [NEWPREP].  The main
   conclusions are:
   o  Stringprep is bound to a specific version of Unicode: 3.2.
      Stringprep has not been updated to new versions of Unicode.
      Therefore, the protocols using Stringprep are stuck to Unicode
      3.2.
   o  The protocols need to be updated to support new versions of
      Unicode.  The protocols would like to not be bound to a specific
      version of Unicode, but rather have better Unicode agility in the
      way of IDNA2008.  This is important partly because it is usually
      impossible for an application to require Unicode 3.2; the
      application gets whatever version of Unicode is available on the
      host.
   o  The protocols require better bidirectional support (bidi) than
      currently offered by Stringprep.
   o  If the protocols are updated to use a new version of Stringprep or
      another framework, then backward compatibility is an important
      requirement.  For example, Stringprep is based on and may use NFKC
      [UAX15], while IDNA2008 mostly uses NFC [UAX15].
   o  Protocols use each other; for example, a protocol can use user
      identifiers that are later passed to SASL, LDAP or another
      authentication mechanism.  Therefore, common set of rules or
      classes of strings are preferred over specific rules for each
      protocol.

   Protocols that use Stringprep profiles use strings for different

Internet-Draft    Stringprep Revision Problem Statement    December 2010


   purposes:
   o  XMPP uses a different Stringprep profile for each part of the XMPP
      address (JID): a localpart which is similar to a username and used
      for authentication, a domainpart which is a domain name and a
      resource part which is less restrictive than the localpart.
   o  iSCSI uses a Stringprep profile for the IQN, which is very similar
      to (often is) a DNS domain name.
   o  SASL and LDAP uses a Stringprep profile for usernames.
   o  LDAP uses a set of Stringprep profiles.

   During the newprep BOF, it was the consensus of the attendees that it
   would be highly desirable to have a replacement of Stringprep, with
   similar characteristics to IDNA2008.  That replacement should be
   defined so that the protocols could use internationalized strings
   without a lot of specialized internationalization work, since
   internationalization expertise is not available in the respective
   protocols or working groups.


3.  Major Topics for Consideration

   This section provides an overview of major topics that a Stringprep
   replacement needs to address.  The headings correspond roughly with
   categories under which known Stringprep-using protocol RFCs have been
   evaluated.  For the details of those evaluations, see Appendix A.

3.1.  Comparison

3.1.1.  Comparison methods

   Identifiers can be conveniently organized into three classes or
   "buckets":

   1.  Identifiers that must compare equally byte for byte. [[anchor4:
       In the Jabber discussion from Beijing, Ted Hardie asked that (1)
       actually be "codepoint for codepoint".  Is that what's intended?
       It seems to me that that is already a case of (2), because
       there's an algorithm to compare (say) my UTF-16 and your UCS-4.
       Discussion would be helpful, please. --ajs@crankycanuck.ca]]
   2.  Identifiers that do not compare equally byte for byte, but that
       can always be compared for equality based on an algorithm
       everyone can agree on.
   3.  Identifiers for which there is no single comparison algorithm on
       which everyone can agree.  (For instance, there may be locale-
       sensitive comparison rules for identifiers.)

   A subclass of case (3) is one in which, within some constrained
   population, the comparison rules are clear even though such rules are



Blanchet & Sullivan       Expires June 12, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    Stringprep Revision Problem Statement    December 2010


   not universally applicable.  So, for instance, users of US-ASCII may
   all agree on a comparison function, but the set of US-ASCII users and
   Turkish users may not all agree about the same comparison function.
   For the purposes of the precis work, it is not plain whether this
   subclass case is relevant, so categorization will include it.

   In the section treating the existing known cases, Appendix A, these
   "buckets" will be called Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, and Type 3a.

3.1.2.  Effect of comparison

   The comparisons outlined in Section 3.1.1 may have different effects
   when applied.  It is necessary to evaluate the effects if a
   comparison results in a false positive, and what the effects are if a
   comparison results in a false negative.  It is particularly important
   to evaluate the effects on security of these answers.

3.2.  Dealing with characters

3.2.1.  Case folding, case sensitivity, and case preservation

   In IDNA2003, labels are always mapped to lower case before the
   Punycode transformation.  In IDNA2003, there is no mapping at all:
   input is either a valid U-label or it is not.  At the same time,
   upper-case characters are by definition not valid U-labels, because
   they fall into the Unstable category (category B) of [RFC5892].

   If there are protocols that require upper and lower cases be
   preserved, then the analogy with IDNA2008 will break down.
   Accordingly, existing protocols are to be evaluated according to the
   following criteria:

   1.  Does the protocol use case folding?  For all blocks of code
       points, or just for certain subsets?
   2.  Is the system or protocol case sensitive?
   3.  Does the system or protocol preserve case?

3.2.2.  Stringprep and NFKC

   Stringprep profiles may use normalization.  If they do, they use NFKC
   [UAX15].  It is not clear that NFKC is the right normalization to use
   in all cases.  In [UAX15], there is the following observation
   regarding Normalization Forms KC and KD: "It is best to think of
   these Normalization Forms as being like uppercase or lowercase
   mappings: useful in certain contexts for identifying core meanings,
   but also performing modifications to the text that may not always be
   appropriate."  For things like the spelling of users' names, then,
   NFKC may not be the best form to use.  At the same time, one of the



Blanchet & Sullivan       Expires June 12, 2011                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    Stringprep Revision Problem Statement    December 2010


   nice things about NFKC is that it deals with the width of characters
   that are otherwise similar, by canonicalizing half-width to full-
   width.  This mapping step can be crucial in practice.  The WG will
   need to analyze the different use profiles and consider whether NFKC
   or NFC is a better normalization for each profile.

   For the purposes of evaluating an existing example of Stringprep use,
   it is helpful to know whether it uses no normalization, NFKC, or NFC.

3.2.3.  Character mapping

   Along with the case mapping issues raised in Section 3.2.1, there is
   the question of whether some characters are mapped either to other
   characters or to nothing during Stringprep.  [RFC3454], Section 3,
   outlines a number of characters that are mapped to nothing, and also
   permits Stringprep profiles to define their own mappings.

3.2.4.  Prohibited characters

   Along with case folding and other character mappings, many protocols
   have characters that are simply disallowed.  For example, control
   characters and special characters such as "@" or "/" may be
   prohibited in a protocol.

   One of the primary changes of IDNA2008 is in the way it approaches
   Unicode code points.  IDNA2003 created an explicit list of excluded
   or mapped-away characters; anything in Unicode 3.2 that was not so
   listed could be assumed to be allowed under the protocol.  IDNA2008
   begins instead from the assumption that code points are disallowed,
   and then relies on Unicode properties to derive whether a given code
   point actually is allowed in the protocol.

   Moreover, there is more than one class of "allowed in the protocol".
   While some code points are disallowed outright, some are allowed only
   in certain contexts.  The reasons for the context-dependent rules
   have to do with the way some characters are used.  For instance, the
   ZERO WIDTH JOINER and ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER (ZWJ, U+200D and ZWNJ,
   U+200C) are allowed with contextual rules because they are required
   in some circumstances, yet are considered punctuation by Unicode and
   would therefore be DISALLOWED under the usual IDNA2008 derivation
   rules.

3.2.5.  Internal structure, delimiters, and special characters

   IDNA2008 has a special problem with delimiters, because the delimiter
   "character" in the DNS wire format is not really part of the data.
   In DNS, the wire format indicates label length.  When the label is
   presented in presentation format as part of a fully qualified domain



Blanchet & Sullivan       Expires June 12, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    Stringprep Revision Problem Statement    December 2010


   name, the label separator FULL STOP, U+002E (.) is used.  But because
   that label separator does not travel with the wire format of the
   domain name, there is no way to encode a different,
   "internationalized" separator in IDNA2008.

   Other protocols may include characters with similar special meaning
   within the protocol.  Common characters for these purposes include
   FULL STOP, U+002E (.); COMMERCIAL AT, U+0040 (@); HYPHEN-MINUS,
   U+002D (-); SOLIDUS, U+002F (/); and LOW LINE, U+005F (_).  The mere
   inclusion of such a character in the protocol is not enough for it to
   be considered similar to another protocol using the same character;
   instead, handling of the character must be taken into consideration
   as well.

   An important issue to tackle here is whether it is valuable to map to
   or from these special characters as part of the Stringprep
   replacement.  In some locales, the analogue to FULL STOP, U+002E is
   some other character, and users may expect to be able to substitute
   their normal stop for FULL STOP.

3.3.  Where the data comes from and where it goes

3.3.1.  User input and the source of protocol elements

   Some protocol elements are provided by users, and others are not.
   Those that are not may presumably be subject to greater restrictions,
   whereas those that users provide likely need to permit the broadest
   range of code points.  The following questions are helpful:

   1.  Do users input the strings directly?
   2.  If so, how? (keyboard, stylus, voice, copy-paste, etc.)
   3.  Where do we place the dividing line between user interface and
       protocol? (see [RFC5895])

3.3.2.  User output

   Just as only some protocol elements are expected to be entered
   directly by users, only some protocol elements are intended to be
   consumed directly by users.  It is important to know how users are
   expected to be able to consume the protocol elements, because
   different environments present different challenges.  An element that
   is only ever delivered as part of a vCard remains in machine-readable
   format, so the problem of visual confusion is not a great one.  Is
   the protocol element published as part of a vCard, a web directory,
   on a business card, or on "the side of a bus"?  Do users use the
   protocol element as an identifier (which means that they might enter
   it again in some other context)?

Internet-Draft    Stringprep Revision Problem Statement    December 2010


3.3.3.  Operations

   Some strings are useful as part of the protocol but are not used as
   input to other operations (for instance, purely informative or
   descriptive text).  Other strings are used directly as input to other
   operations (such as cryptographic hash functions), or are used
   together with other strings to (such as concatenating a string with
   some others to form a unique identifier).

3.3.3.1.  String classes

   Strings often have a similar function in different protocols.  For
   instance, many different protocols contain user identifiers or
   passwords.  A single profile for all such uses might be desirable.

   Often, a string in a protocol is effectively a protocol element from
   another protocol.  For instance, different systems might use the same
   credentials database for authentication.

3.3.3.2.  Community considerations

   A Stringprep replacement that does anything more than just update
   Stringprep to the latest version of Unicode will probably entail some
   changes.  It is important to identify the willingness of the
   protocol-using community to accept backwards-incompatible changes.
   By the same token, it is important to evaluate the desire of the
   community for features not available under Stringprep.


4.  Considerations for Stringprep replacement

   The above suggests the following direction for the working group:
   o  A stringprep replacement should be defined.
   o  The replacement should take an approach similar to IDNA2008, in
      that it enables Unicode agility.
   o  Protocols share similar characteristics of strings.  Therefore,
      defining i18n preparation algorithms for a (small) set of string
      classes may be sufficient for most cases and provides the
      coherence among a set of protocol friends.
   o  The sets of string classes need to be evaluated according to the
      considerations that make up the headings in Section 3
   o  It is reasonable to limit scope to Unicode code points, and rule
      the mapping of data from other character encodings outside the
      scope of this effort.

   Existing deployments already depend on Stringprep profiles.
   Therefore, the working group will need to consider the effects of any
   new strategy on existing deployments.  By way of comparison, it is

   worth noting that some characters were acceptable in IDNA labels
   under IDNA2003, but are not protocol-valid under IDNA2008 (and
   conversely).  Different implementers may make different decisions
   about what to do in such cases; this could have interoperability
   effects.  The working group will need to trade better support for
   different linguistic environments against the potential side effects
   of backward incompatibility.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document merely states what problems are to be solved, and does
   not define a protocol.  There are undoubtedly security implications
   of the particular results that will come from the work to be
   completed.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


7.  Discussion home for this draft

   This document is intended to define the problem space discussed on
   the precis@ietf.org mailing list.
