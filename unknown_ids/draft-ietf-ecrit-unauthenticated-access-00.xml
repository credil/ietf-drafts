         <t>The IETF emergency services architecture assumes that the calling device has acquired
            rights to use the access network or that no authentication is required for the access
            network, such as for public wireless access points. Subsequent protocol interactions,
            such as obtaining location information, learning the address of the Public Safety
            Answering Point (PSAP) and the emergency call itself are largely decoupled from the
            underlying network access procedures.</t>
         <t>In some cases, the device does not have credentials for network access, does not have a
            VoIP provider or application service provider (ASP), or the credentials have become
            invalid, e.g., because the user has exhausted their prepaid balance or the account has
            expired. </t>
         <t>This document provides a problem statement, introduces terminology and describes an
            extension for the base IETF emergency services architecture to address these scenarios.

      <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
         <t> Summoning police, the fire department or an ambulance in emergencies is one of the
            fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone. As telephone functionality moves
            from circuit-switched telephony to Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that
            this core functionality will continue to work at least as well as it has for the older
            technology. New devices and services are being made available that could be used to make
            a request for help, which are not traditional telephones, and users are increasingly
            expecting them to be used to place emergency calls. </t>
         <t> Roughly speaking, the IETF emergency services architecture (see <xref
               target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework"/>)
            divides responsibility for handling emergency calls between the access network (ISP),
            the application service provider (ASP) that may be a VoIP service provider and the
            provider of emergency signaling services, the emergency service network (ESN). The
            access network may provide location information to end systems, but does not have to
            provide any ASP signaling functionality. The emergency caller can reach the ESN either
            directly or through the ASP's outbound proxy. Any of the three parties can provide the
            mapping from location to PSAP URI by offering LoST <xref target="RFC5222"/> services.</t>

         <t> In general, a set of automated configuration mechanisms allows a device to function in
            a variety of architectures, without the user being aware of the details on who provides
            location, mapping services or call routing services. However, if emergency calling is to
            be supported when the calling device lacks access network authorization or does not have
            an ASP, one or more of the providers may need to provide additional services and
            functions. </t>
         <t> In all cases, the end device MUST be able to perform a LoST lookup and otherwise
            conduct the emergency call in the same manner as when the three exceptional conditions
            discussed below do not apply.</t>
         <t> We distinguish between three conditions: </t>
         <t>
            <list style="hanging">
               <t hangText="No access authorization (NAA):"> The current access network requires
                  access authorization and the caller does not have valid user credentials. (This
                  includes the case where the access network allows pay-per-use, as is common for
                  wireless hotspots, but there is insufficient time to pay for access.) <vspace
                     blankLines="1"/></t>
               <t hangText="
               No ASP (NASP):"> The caller does not have an
                  ASP at the time of the call. <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
               <t hangText="Zero-balance ASP (ZBP):"> The caller has valid credentials
                  with an ASP, but is not allowed to access services like placing calls in case
                  of a VoIP service, e.g., because the user has a zero balance in a prepaid account.<vspace blankLines="1"/>
               </t>
            </list>
         </t>
         <t>A user may well suffer from both NAA and NASP or ZBP at the same time. Depending on local
            policy and regulations, it may not be possible to place emergency calls in the NAA case.
            Unless local regulations require user identification, it should always be possible to
            place calls in the NASP case, with minimal impact on the ISP. Unless the ESN requires
            that all calls traverse a known set of VSPs, a caller should be able to place an
            emergency call in the ZBP case. We discuss each case in separate sections below. </t>



         <section title="No Access Authorization (NAA)">
            <t> In the NAA (No Access Authorization) case, the emergency caller does not posses
               valid credentials for the access network. If local regulations or policy allows or
               requires support for emergency calls in NAA, the access network may or needs to 
               cooperate in providing emergency calling services.  Support for NAA emergency calls
               is subject to the local policy of the ISP. Such policy may vary substantially between
               ISPs and typically depends on external factors that are not under the ISP control.
               Hence, no global mandates for supporting emergency calls in relation to NAA can be made.
               However, it makes a lot of sense to offer appropriate building blocks that enable ISPs
               to flexibly react on the local environment.Generally, the ISP will want to ensure that
               devices do not pretend to place emergency calls, but then abuse the access for 
               obtaining more general services fraudulently. </t>
            <t> In particular, the ISP MUST allow emergency callers to acquire an IP address and to
               reach a LoST server, either provided by the ISP or some third party. It SHOULD also
               provide location information via one of the mechanisms specified in <xref
                  target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"/> without requiring authorization unless it can
               safely assume that all nodes in the access network can determine their own location,
               e.g., via GPS.</t>

            <t> The details of how filtering is performed depends on the details of the ISP
               architecture and are beyond the scope of this document. We illustrate a possible
               model. If the ISP runs its own LoST server, it would maintain an access control list
               including all IP addresses contained in responses returned by the LoST server, as
               well as the LoST server itself. (It may need to translate the domain names returned
               to IP addresses and hope that the resolution captures all possible DNS responses.)
               Since the media destination addresses are not predictable, the ISP also has to
               provide a SIP outbound proxy so that it can determine the media addresses and add
               those to the filter list. </t>
         </section>
         <section title="No ASP (NASP)">
            <t> In the second case, the emergency caller has no current ASP.
               This case poses no particular difficulties unless it is assumed that only ASPs
               provide LoST server or that ESNs only accept calls that reach it through a set of
               known ASPs. However, since the calling device cannot obtain configuration information
               from its ASP, the ISP MUST provide the address of a LoST server via DHCP <xref
                  target="RFC5223"/> if this model is to be supported. The LoST server may be
               operated either by the ISP or a third party. </t>
               Furthermore, ASPs may support emergency callers that cannot present
               valid credentials (e.g. because they do not have a subscription with the specific
               ASP). For this, a fundamental prerequisite is that the client used by
               the emergency caller is compatible with the ASP infrastructure.
         </section>

         <section title="Zero-Balance Application Service Provider (ZBP)">

            <t> In the case of zero-balance ASP, the ASP can authenticate the
               caller, but the caller is not authorized to use ASP services, e.g., because
               the contract has expired or the prepaid account for the customer has been depleted.
               Naturally, an ASP can simply disallow access by such customers, so that all such
               customers find themselves in the NASP situation described above. If ASPs desire or are
               required by regulation to provide emergency calling services to such customers, they
               need to provide LoST services to such customers and may need to provide outbound SIP
               proxy services. As usual, the calling device looks up the LoST server via SIP
               configuration. </t>
            <t> Unless the emergency call traverses a PSTN gateway or the ASP charges for IP-to-IP
               calls, there is little potential for fraud. If the ASP also operates the LoST server,
               the outbound proxy MAY restrict outbound calls to the SIP URIs returned by the LoST
               server. It is NOT RECOMMENDED to rely on a fixed list of SIP URIs, as that list may
               change. </t>
         </section>

      <section title="A Warning Note">
         <t>At the time of writing there is no regulation in place that demands the functionality
            described in this memo. SDOs have started their work on this subject in a proactive
            fashion in the anticipation that national regulation will demand it for a subset of
            network environments.</t>
         <t>There are also indications that the functionality of unauthenticated emergency calls
            (called SIM-less calls) in today's cellular system in certain countries leads to a fair
            amount of hoax or test calls. This causes overload situations at PSAPs which is
            considered harmful to the overall availability and reliability of emergency services.</t>
         <t>
            <list style="empty">
               <t>As an example, Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM, Switzerland) provided
                  statistics about emergency (112) calls in Switzerland from Jan. 1997 to Nov. 2001.
                  Switzerland did not offer SIM-less emergency calls except for almost a month in 
                  July 2000 where a significant increase in hoax and test calls was reported. As a
                  consequence, the functionality was disabled again. More details can be found in
                  the panel presentations of the 3rd SDO Emergency Services Workshop <xref

               <t hangText="Non-Service-Initialized Device:"><vspace blankLines="1"/> A device for

                  terms: "un-activated", "un-provisioned", or "unbranded" device. <vspace
                     blankLines="1"/></t>

               <t hangText="Unauthenticated Emergency Service:">
                  <vspace blankLines="1"/> The term "unauthenticated emergency services" refers to
                  the case where an emergency caller does not have credentials (e.g., no SIM card,
                  no username and password, no private key) to successfully complete network access
                  authentication procedures or to use a VoIP service or both. <vspace blankLines="1"
                  /> The case of no credentials for network access is likely case in enterprise
                  networks, home networks, or governmental networks. In other cases the user might
                  be able to obtain such credentials, for example in hotspots found in hotels, at
                  airports, and in many coffee shops. Unfortunately, users have to go through a
                  lengthy procedure (often involving captive portals) to obtain a temporary account
                  in exchange of money. In emergency situations it is certainly not desirable to let
                  the user find their way through a number of webpages and to type-in their credit
                  card details. <vspace blankLines="1"/> It is important to differentiate between
                  the unavailability of credentials for network access and for VoIP access as the
                  network provider and the VoIP provider are often distinct entities and therefore
                  the user might have different credentials with the two. <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

               <t hangText="Unauthorized Emergency Service:">
                  <vspace blankLines="1"/> The term "unauthorized emergency services" refers to the
                  case where a device aims to attach to the network or to use a VoIP service but the
                  authorization procedure fails. The authorization step may fail as a consequence of
                  triggering different procedures (such as network access authentication or
                  registration at the VoIP providers registrar). Still, the device is granted
                  (limited) access to perform emergency calling. It is important to differentiate
                  between network operator and VoIP provider as they often refer to different
                  parties and therefore the authorization decision might be executed by a different
                  backend infrastructure. <vspace blankLines="1"/> Lack of authorization might be
                  caused by a number of reasons, including credit exhaustion, expired accounts,
                  locked account, missing access rights (e.g., access to the competitors enterprise
                  network), etc. <vspace blankLines="1"/>

            services support without architecture extensions.</t>
         <t> On a very high-level, the steps to
            be performed by an end host not being attached to
            the network and the user starting to make an emergency call are the following: </t>
         <t>
            <list style="symbols">
               <t>Some radio networks have added support for unauthenticated emergency access, some
                  other type of networks advertise these capabilities using layer beacons. The end
                  host learns about these unauthenticated emergency services capabilities either
                  from the link layer type or from advertisement.</t>
               <t>The end host uses the link layer specific network attachment procedures defined
                  for unauthenticated network access in order to get access to emergency services.</t>
               <t>When the link layer network attachment procedure is completed the end host learns
                  basic configuration information using DHCP from the ISP, including the address of
                  the LoST server. </t>
               <t>The end host MUST use a Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) supported by the IAP
                  or ISP to learn its own location. </t>
               <t>The end host MUST use the LoST protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost"/> to
                  query the LoST server and asks for the PSAP URI responsible for that location.</t>
               <t>After the PSAP URI has been returned to the end host, the SIP UA in the end host
                  directly initiates a SIP INVITE towards the PSAP URI.</t>
            </list>
         </t>
         <t> The IAP and the ISP will probably want to make sure that the claimed emergency caller
            indeed performs an emergency call rather than using the network for other purposes, and
            thereby acting fraudulent by skipping any authentication, authorization and accounting
            procedures. By restricting access of the unauthenticated emergency caller to the LoST
            server and the PSAP URI, traffic can be restricted only to emergency calls (see also 
            section 1.1). </t>
         <t> Using the above procedures, the unauthenticated emergency caller will be successful
            only if: </t>
         <t>
            <list style="symbols">
               <t>the ISP (or the IAP) support an LCP that the end host can use to learn its
                  location. A list of mandatory-to-implement LCPs can be found in <xref
                     target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"/>). </t>
               <t>the ISP configures it's firewalls appropriately to allow emergency calls to
                  traverse the network towards the PSAP. </t>

         <t> Some IAPs/ISPs may not be able to fulfill the above requirements. If those IAPs/ISPs

         <t> This section provides a recommended configuration for unauthenticated emergency 
            services support without architecture extensions.</t>
         <t>For unauthenticated emergency services support it is insufficient to provide mechanisms
            only at the link layer in order to bypass authentication for the cases when:</t>
         <t>
            <list style="symbols">
               <t>the IAP/ISP does not support any Location Configuration Protocol</t>
               <t>the IAP/ISP cannot assume the end hosts to support a Location Configuration 
                  Protocol</t>
               <t>the IAP/ISP does not have knowledge of a LoST server (which would assist the
                  client to find the correct PSAP)</t>
            </list>
         </t>


         <t> A modification to the emergency services architecture is necessary since the IAP and
            the ISP need to make sure that the claimed emergency caller indeed performs an emergency
            call rather than using the network for other purposes, and thereby acting fraudulent by
            skipping any authentication, authorization and accounting procedures. Hence, without
            introducing some understanding of the specific application the ISP (and consequently the
            IAP) will not be able to detect and filter malicious activities. This leads to the
            architecture described in <xref target="arch-fig"/> where the IAP needs to implement
            extensions to link layer procedures for unauthenticated emergency service access and the
            ISP needs to deploy emergency services related entities used for call routing, such as
            the Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP), a Location Configuration Server (LCS) and a
            mapping database.</t>

                  basic configuration information using DHCP from the ISP, including the address of
                  the ESRP, as shown in (2).</t>
               <t>When the IP address configuration is completed then the SIP UA initiates a SIP

               <t>The ESRP receives the INVITE and processes it according to the description in
                     <xref target="esrp-sip"/>. The location of the end host may need to be
                  determined using a protocol interaction shown in (4).</t>
               <t>Potentially, an interaction between the LCS of the ISP and the LCS of the IAP may
                  be necessary, see (5).</t>
               <t>Finally, the correct PSAP for the location of the end host has to be evaluated,

         </t>
         <t>For editorial reasons the end-to-end SIP and media exchange between the PSAP and SIP UA
            are not shown in <xref target="arch-fig"/>.</t>

         <t>Two important aspects are worth to highlight: </t>
         <t>
            <list style="symbols">
               <t>The IAP/ISP needs to understand the concept of emergency calls or other emergency
                  applicationsand the SIP profile described in this document. No other VoIP protocol
                  profile, such as XMPP, Skype, etc., are supported for emergency calls in this
                  particular architecture. Other profiles may be added in the future, but the
                  deployment effort is enormous since they have to be universally deployed. </t>
               <t>The end host has no obligation to determine location information. It may attach
                  location information if it has location available (e.g., from a GPS receiver).</t>
            </list>

         </t>
         <t><xref target="arch-fig"/> shows that the ISP needs to deploy SIP-based emergency
            services functionality. It is important to note that the ISP itself may outsource the
            functionality by simply providing access to them (e.g., it puts the IP address of an
            ESRP or a LoST server into an allow-list). For editorial reasons this outsourcing is not
            shown.</t>

      <section title="NAA considerations for the network attachment procedure of IAPs/ISPs">
      <t>This section discusses different methods to indicate an emergency service request as part
         of network attachment. It provides some general considerations and recommendations that
         are not specific to the access technology.</t>
      <t>To perform network attachment and get access to the resources provided by an IAP/ISP, the
         end host uses access technology specific network attachment procedures, including for
         example network detection and selection, authentication, and authorization. For initial
         network attachment of an emergency service requester, the method of how the emergency
         indication is given to the IAP/ISP is specific to the access technology. However, a number
         of general approaches can be identified:</t>
      <t>- Link layer emergency indication: The end host provides an indication, e.g. an emergency
           parameter or flag, as part of the link layer signaling for initial network attachment.
           Examples include an emergency bit signalled in the IEEE 802.16-2009 wireless link.<sm> In IEEE 802.11 WLAN, an emergency indicator
           generates a change in the behaviour of the link layer authentication mechanism.</sm>
           signalling allows an IEEE 802.1X to occur without exchanging cryptogrpahic keys </t>
      <t>- Higher-layer emergency indication: Typically emergency indication in access
           authentication. The emergency caller's end host provides an indication as part of the
           access authentication exchanges. EAP based authentication is of particular relevance
           here. <sm>Examples are the EAP NAI decoration used in WiMAX networks and modification of the authentication exchange in IEEE 802.11</sm>
           <xref target="nwgstg3"/>.</t>

         <section title="Link layer emergency indication">
         <t>In general, link layer emergency indications provide good integration into the actual
            network access procedure regarding the enabling of means to recognize and prioritize an
            emergency service request from an end host at a very early stage of the network
            attachment procedure. However, support in end hosts for such methods cannot be
            considered to be commonly available.</t>
         <t>No general recommendations are given in the scope of this memo due to the following
            reasons:</t>
         <t>- Dependency on the specific access technology.</t>
         <t>- Dependency on the specific access network architecture. Access authorization and
              policy decisions typically happen at a different layers of the protocol stack and in
              different entities than those terminating the link-layer signaling. As a result, link
              layer indications need to be distributed and translated between the different involved
              protocol layers and entities. Appropriate methods are specific to the actual
              architecture of the IAP/ISP network.</t>
         </section>

         <section title="Higher-layer emergency indication">
         <t>This section focuses on emergency indications based on authentication and authorization
            in EAP-based network access.</t>
         <t>An advantage of combining emergency indications with the actual network attachment
            procedure performing authentication and authorization is the fact that the emergency
            indication can directly be taken into account in the authentication and authorization
            server that owns the policy for granting access to the network resources. As a result,
            there is no direct dependency on the access network architecture that otherwise would
            need to take care of merging link-layer indications into the AA and policy decision
            process.</t>
         <t>EAP signaling happens at a relatively early stage of network attachment, so it is likely
            to match most requirements for prioritization of emergency signaling. However, it does
            not cover early stages of link layer activity in the network attachment process.
            Possible conflicts may arise e.g. in case of MAC-based filtering in entities terminating
            the link-layer signaling in the network (like a base station). In normal operation, EAP
            related information will only be recognized in the NAS. Any entity residing between end
            host and NAS should not be expected to understand/parse EAP messages.</t>
         <t>The following potential methods to provide emergency indications in combination with
            EAP-based network attachment, are recognized:</t>

         <t>1) NAI-based emergency indication: </t>
         <t>An emergency indication can be given by forming a specific NAI that is used as the
            identity in EAP based authentication for network entry. Methods include:</t>
         <t>1.a) NAI Decoration: NAI decoration is commonly used in routing EAP responses within
            the IAP/ISP AAA infrastructure. Additional decoration can be used to add an indication
            that the network attachment attempt is meant for accessing emergency services.
            Potential advantages of such approach include that it requires only minimal realization
            effort compared to link-layer indications with good integration into the authentication
            and authorization procedures. The same procedure can be used for all NAA cases (both
            unauthenticated and unauthorized) as well as for normal attachment with a valid 
            subscription.
            A potential disadvantage is that such EAP decoration is not globally defined across all
            different access technologies.</t>
         <t>1.b) Emergency NAI: The NAI comes with a realm or username part indicating emergency
            (e.g. 'emergency@emergency.com'). 
            An advantage of this method for NAA cases is that no new requirements are put on the
            involved signaling procedures. Only the identity used for network entry is impacted. 
            Potential disadvantages include that different methods to indicate emergency for NAA
            cases and standard emergency network attachments may be required. Also, modifying the
            NAI itself (the username@realm part) may conflict with network selection and network
            entry procedures, depending on the actual access network.</t>

         <t>2) Emergency EAP method</t>
         <t>An emergency indication can be given by using a dedicated EAP method that is reserved
            for emergency network attachment only.</t>
         <t>2.a) Existing EAP method with new type: An existing EAP method may be used. EAP methods
            themselves typically do not support emergency indication. One option would be to pick a
            common EAP method like EAP-TLS and allocate a new method type for the same method that
            is exclusively reserved to emergency use. Such EAP method should be chosen in a way that
            the same method can support NAA cases as well as standard emergency network attachment.</t>
         <t>2.b) Existing EAP method: Same as 2a), but without assigning a new EAP method type for
            emergency. In this case some implicit indication must be used. For example, in cases
            where EAP-TLS is used in network attachment in combination with client certificates,
            the absence of a client certificate could be interpreted by the network as a request
            for emergency network attachment.</t>
         <t>2.c) Emergency EAP method: A new EAP method could be defined that is specifically
            designed for emergency network entry in NAA cases. Most likely, such EAP method would
            not be usable for standard emergency network attachment with an existing subscription.
            Such dedicated emergency EAP method should be key-generating in compliance with RFC3748
            to enable the regular air interface security methods even in unauthenticated operation.</t>
         </section>
         <section title="Securing network attachment in NAA cases">
         <t>For network attachment in NAA cases, it may make sense to secure the link-layer
            connection between the device and the IAP/ISP. This especially holds for wireless access
            with examples being <sm> IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.16 </sm> based access. The latter even mandates secured
            communication across the wireless link for all IAP/ISP networks based on <xref target="nwgstg3"/>.</t>
         <t>Therefore, for network attachment that is by default based on EAP authentication it is
            desirable <sm> [Not mandatory for IEEE 802.11, so perhaps we could remove these next couple of words] or even mandatory </sm>
            also for NAA network attachment to use a key-generating EAP
            method (that provides an MSK key to the authenticator to bootstrap further key
            derivation for protecting the wireless link).</t>

         <t>The following approaches to match the above can be identified:</t>

         <t>1) Server-only authentication: The device of the emergency service requester performs
            an EAP method with the IAP/ISP EAP server that performs server authentication only.
            An example for this is EAP-TLS. This provides a certain level of assurance about the
            IAP/ISP to the device user. It requires the device to be provisioned with appropriate
            trusted root certificates to be able to verify the server certificate of the EAP server
            (unless this step is explicitly skipped in the device in case of an emergency service
            request).</t>

         <t>2) Null authentication: <sm>In one case (e.g. WiMAX) </sm>an EAP method is performed. However, no credentials specific to
            either the server or the device or subscription are used as part of the authentication
            exchange. An example for this would be an EAP-TLS exchange with using the TLS_DH_anon
            (anonymous) ciphersuite. Alternatively, a publicly available static key for emergency
            access could be used. In the latter case, the device would need to be provisioned with
            the appropriate emergency key for the IAP/ISP in advance.
            
            <sm> In another case (e.g. IEEE 802.11), no EAP method is used, so that empty frames are transported during the over the air IEEE 802.1X exchange. In this case the
            authentication state machine completes with no cryptographic keys being exchanged.</sm></t>

         <t>3) Device authentication: This case extends the server-only authentication case. If the
            device is configured with a device certificate and the IAP/ISP EAP server can rely on a
            trusted root allowing the EAP server to verify the device certificate, at least the
            device identity (e.g. the MAC address) can be authenticated by the IAP/ISP in NAA cases.
            An example for this are WiMAX devices that are shipped with device certificates issued
            under the global WiMAX device public-key infrastructure. To perform unauthenticated
            emergency calls, if allowed by the IAP/ISP, such devices perform EAP-TLS based network
            attachment with client authentication based on the device certificate.</t>
