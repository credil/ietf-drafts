Abstract

   Where the payload carried over a pseudowire carries a number of
   identifiable flows it can in some circumstances be desirable to carry
   those flows over the equal cost multiple paths that exist in the
   packet switched network.  This draft describes two methods of
   achieving that, the one by including an additional label in the label
   stack, the other by using a block of alternative pseudowire labels.

1.  Introduction

   A pseudowire is defined as a mechanism that carries the essential
   elements of an emulated service from one provider edge (PE) to one or
   more other PEs over a packet switched network (PSN) [10].

   A pseudowire is normally transported over one single network path,
   even if multiple ECMP paths exit between the ingress and egress
   PEs[2] [3].  This is required to preserve the characteristics of the
   emulated service (e.g. avoid misordering for example for SAToP
   pseudowire's [4]).  Except in the extreme case described in Section
   6, the new capability proposed in this draft does not change this
   default property of pseudowires.

   Some pseudowire's are used to transport large volumes of IP traffic
   between routers at two locations.  One example of this is the use of
   an Ethernet pseudowire to create a virtual direct link between a pair
   of routers.  Such pseudowire's may carry from hundred's of Mbps to
   Gbps of traffic.  Such pseudowire's do not require ordering to be
   preserved between packets of the pseudowire.  They only require
   ordering to be preserved within the context of each individual
   transported IP flow.  Some operators have requested the ability to
   explicitly configure such a pseudowire to leverage the availability
   of multiple ECMP paths.  This allows for better capacity planning as
   the statistical multiplexing of a larger number of smaller flows is
   more efficient than with a smaller set of larger flows.  Although
   Ethernet is used as an example above, the mechanisms decsribed in
   this draft are general mechanisms that may be applied to any
   pseudowire type in which there are identifable flows, and in which
   the there is no requirement to preserve the order between flows.

1.1.  ECMP in Label Switched Routers

   Label switched routers commonly hash the label stack or some elements
   of the label stack as a method of discrminating between flows, in
   order to distribute those flows over the available equal cost
   multiple paths that exist in the network.  Since the label at the
   bottom of stack is usually the label most closely associated with the
   flow, this normally provides the greatest entropy and hence is
   normally included in the hash.  The describes two methods of setting
   bottom of stack label in order to facilitate the load balancing of
   the flows with a pseudowire over the available ECMPs.

   o  Use of a load balance label

   o  Allocation of multiple pseudowire labels

   The load balance label mechanism is the more general and more



Bryant, et al.           Expires August 22, 2008                [Page 3]

   powerful method.  The pseudowire label block is an OPTINAL method
   that may be negotiated by PEs unable to support the additional label
   needed by the load balance label method.

1.2.  Load Balance Label

   In this approach an additional label is interposed between the
   pseudowire label and the control word, or if the control word is not
   present, between the pseudowire label and the pseudowire payload.
   This additional label is called the pseudowire load balancing label
   (LB label).  Indivisible flows within the pseudowire MUST be mapped
   to the same pseudowire LB label by the ingress PE.  The pseudowire
   load balancing label stimulates the correct ECMP load balancing
   behaviour in the PSN.  On receipt of the pseudowire packet at the
   egress PE (which knows this additional label is present) the label is
   discarded without processing.

   Note that there is no protocol constraint on the value of a LB label.

1.3.  Pseudowire Label Block

   In this approach a contiguous block of pseudowire labels are
   allocated to each pseudowire by the egress PE.  Flows carried by the
   pseudowire labels are spread over the set of pseudowire labels, such
   that Indivisible flows within the pseudowire MUST be mapped to the
   same pseudowire label by the ingress PE.  The use of a multiplicity
   of alternate pseudowire labels stimulates the correct ECMP load
   balancing behaviour in the PSN.

   Note that the pseudowire labels MUST be allocated as a contiguous
   block.

   Support for this method is OPTIONAL.


2.  Native Service Processing Function

   The Native Service Processing (NSP) function is a component of a PE
   that has knowledge of the structure of the emulated service and is
   able to take action on the service outside the scope of the
   pseudowire.  In this case it is required that the NSP in the ingress
   PE identify flows, or groups of flows within the service, and
   indicate the flow (group) identity of each packet as it is passed to
   the pseudowire forwarder.  Since this is an NSP function, by
   definition, the method used to identify a flow is outside the scope
   of the pseudowire design.  Similarly, since the NSP is internal to
   the PE, the method of flow indication to the pseudowire forwarder is
   outside the scope of this document

Internet-Draft                  LB-fat-pw                  February 2008


3.  Pseudowire Forwarder

   The pseudowire forwarder must be provided with a method of mapping
   flows to load balanced paths.  Where the method chosen is the label
   block method, the forwarder uses the flow information provided by the
   NSP to allocate a flow to one of the VC labels in the load balancing
   label block.  In all other respects forwarder operation is identical
   to the normal single VC label case.

   When the load balance label method is used the forwarder must
   generate a label for the flow or group of flows.  How the load
   balance label values are determined is outside the scope of this
   document, however the load balance label allocated to a flow SHOULD
   remain constant.  It is recommended that the method chosen to
   generate the load balancing labels introduces a high degree of
   entropy in their values, to maximise the entropy presented to the
   ECMP path selection mechanism in the LSRs in the PSN, and hence
   distribute the flows as evenly as possible over the available PSN
   ECMP paths.  The forwarder at the ingress PE prepends the pseudowire
   control word (if applicable), then prepends either the pseudowire
   load balancing label, followed by the pseudowire label.
   Alternatively it prepends the pseudowire control word (if
   applicable), then selects and appends one of the allocated pseudowire
   labels.

   The forwarder at the egress PE uses the pseudowire label to identify
   the pseudowire.  If the label block approach is used operation is
   identical to the current non-load balanced case.  Alternatively, from
   the pseudowire context, the egress PE can determine whether a
   pseudowire load balancing label is present, and if one is present,
   the label is discarded.

   All other pseudowire forwarding operations are unmodified by the
   inclusion of the pseudowire load balancing label.

4.  Load Balance Signaling

   This section describes the signalling procedures when [5] is used.

4.1.  Signaling Load Balance Label

   When using the signalling procedures in [5], there is a Pseudowire
   Interface Parameter Sub-TLV type used to signal the desire to include
   the load balance label when advertising a VC label.

   The presence of this parameter indicates that the egress PE requests
   that the ingress PE place a load balance label between the pseudowire
   label and the control word (or is the control word is not present
   between the pseudowire label and the pseudowire payload).

   If the ingress PE recognises load balance label indicator parameter
   but does not wish to include the load balance label, it need only
   issue its own label mapping message for the opposite direction
   without including the load balance label Indicator.  This will
   prevent inclusion of the load balance label in either direction.

   If PWE3 signalling [5] is not in use for a pseudowire, then whether
   the load balance label is used MUST be identically provisioned in
   both PEs at the pseudowire endpoints.  If there is no provisioning
   support for this option, the default behaviour is not to include the
   load balance label.

   Note that what is signaled is the desire to include the load balance
   lable in the label stack.  The value of the label is a local matter
   for the ingress PE, and the label value itself is not signaled.

4.1.1.  Structure of Load Balance Label TLV

   The structure of the load balance label TLV is shown in Figure 3.

4.2.  Signalling Label Block

   When using the signalling procedures in [5], there is a Pseudowire
   Interface load balance sub-TLV type used to signal the desire load
   balance the pseudowire over a block of pseudowire VC labels.

   The presence of this TLV indicates that the egress PE requests that
   the ingress PE distribute the ingress flows present in the pseudowire
   over the block of VC labels sent in this TLV.

   This mechanism is fully backwards compatible.  If the ingress PE does
   not recognise the load balance TLV or does not wish to use it, it
   simply ignores this TLV.

4.2.1.  Structure of Multiple VC TLV

   The field structure is defined in Figure 4.

   |                            Last Label                         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                         Figure 4: Multiple VC TLV

   Where:

   o  MultipleVC is the TLV identifier assigned by IANA

   o  Length is 12

   o  First Label is a 20-bit label value as specified in [6]
      represented as a 20-bit number in a 4 octet field that indicates
      the start of the load balance label block

   o  Last Label is a 20-bit label value as specified in [6] represented
      as a 20-bit number in a 4 octet field that indicates the end of
      the load balance label block

   First Label SHOULD be the normal VC for this pseudowire.

5.  OAM

   The following OAM considerations apply to both methods of load
   balancing.

   Where the OAM is only to be used to perform a basic test that the
   pseudowires have been configured at the PEs, VCCV [11] messages may
   be sent using any load balance pseudowire path, i.e. over any of the
   multiple pseudowire labels, or using any pseudowire load balance
   label.

   Where it is required to verify that a pseudowire is fully functional
   for all flows, VCCV [11] connection verification message MUST be sent
   over each ECMP path to the pseudowire egress PE.  This problem is
   difficult to solve and scales poorly. .  We believe that this problem
   is addressed by the following two methods:

   1.  If a failure occurs within the PSN, this failure will normally be
       detected by the PSN's IGP (link/node failure, link or BFD or IGP
       hello detection), and the IGP convergence will naturally modify
       the ECMP set of network paths between the Ingress and Egress
       PE's.  Hence the PW is only impacted during the normal IGP
       convergence time.

   2.  If the failure is related to the individual corruption of an LFIB
       entry in a router, then only the network path using that specific
       entry is impacted.  If the PW is load balanced over multiple
       network paths, then this failure can only be detected if, by
       chance, the transported OAM flow is mapped onto the impacted
       network path, or all paths are tested.  This type of error may be
       better solved be solved by other means such as LSP self test
       [12].

   To troubleshoot the MPLS PSN, including multiple paths, the
   techniques described in [7] and [8] can be used.


6.  Applicability

   The requirement to load-balance over multiple PSN paths occurs when
   the ratio between the PW access speed and the PSN's core link
   bandwidth is large (e.g. >= 0.1).  ATM and FR are unlikely to meet
   this property.  Ethernet does and this is the reason why this
   document focuses on ethernet.  Applications for other high-access-
   bandwidth PW's (fiber-channel) may be defined in the future.

   This design applies to MPLS pseudowires where it is meaningful to
   deconstruct the packets presented to the ingress PE into flows.  The



Bryant, et al.           Expires August 22, 2008                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                  LB-fat-pw                  February 2008


   mechanism described in this document promotes the distribution of
   flows within the pseudowire over different network paths.  This in
   turn means that whilst packets within a flow are delivered in order
   (subject to normal IP delivery perturbations due to topology
   variation), order is not maintained amongst packets of different
   flows.  It is not proposed to associate a different sequence number
   with each flow.  If sequence number support is required this
   mechanism is not applicable.

   Where it is known that the traffic carried by the ethernet pseudowire
   is IP the method of identifying the flows are well known and can be
   applied.  Such methods typically include hashing on the source and
   destination addresses, the protocol ID and higher-layer flow-
   dependent fields such as TCP/UDP ports, L2TPv3 Session ID's etc.

   Where it is known that the traffic carried by the ethernet pseudowire
   is non-IP, techniques used for link bundling between Ethernet
   switches may be reused.  In this case however the latency
   distribution would be larger than is found in the link bundle case.
   The acceptability of the increased latency is for further study.  Of
   particular importance the Ethernet control frames SHOULD always be
   mapped to the same PSN path to ensure in-order delivery.

   If the payload of an Ethernet PW is made of a single inner flow (i.e.
   an encrypted connection between two routers), then the functionality
   described in this document does not give any benefits, though neither
   does it give any drawbacks.  This is unlikely to be a showstopper for
   two reasons:

   o  Firstly, the customer of a high-bandwidth PW service has incentive
      to get the best transport service because an inefficient use of
      the PSN leads to jitter and eventually to loss to the PW's
      payload.

   o  Secondly, the customer is usually able to tailor their
      applications to generate many flows in the PSN.  A well-known
      example is massive data transport between servers which use many
      parallel TCP sessions.  This same technique can be used by any
      transport protocol: multiple UDP ports, multiple L2TPv3 Session
      ID's, multiple GRE keys may be used to decompose a large flow into
      smaller components.  This approach may be applied to IPSEC where
      multiple SPI's may be allocated to the same security association.

   A node within the PSN is not able to perform deep-packet-inspection
   (DPI) of the PW as the PW technology is not self-describing: the
   structure of the PW payload is only known to the ingress and egress
   PE devices.  The two methods proposed in this document solve this
   limitation.

   The methods describe in this document are transparent to the PSN and
   as such do not require any new capability from the PSN.


7.  Comparision of the Approaches

   There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to each approach:

   o  The LB label method has a better statistical multiplexing
      capability.

   o  The LB label method has a better semantic than the PW Label block
      approach as this latter merges the pseudowire emultiplexor and the
      load balance semantics.

   o  The LB label preserves label space and hence the FIB table size.

   o  The PW Label Block preserves the data plane path of the egress PE

   o  The PW Label Block has better hardware backwards compatibility.

   o  The PW Label Block approach increases the use of LFIB space.  This
      appoach may particularly problematic in p2mp and mp2mp topologies,
      since the impact on LFIB space is felt by all PE nodes using the
      PW Labels Block approach.

   o  It is not clear how many labels need to be allocated for a
      particular PW, the more diverse input is provided to load-hashing
      algorithms within core LSR's the more evenly flows are distributed
      over component-links.  Some operators have expressed concerns at
      the level of tuning that they will need undertake to establish and
      maintain the desired level of load balance.

   o  Both approach anyway require data plane forwarding change for the
      ingress PE.

   o  The LB Label method requires a data plane forwarding change for
      the egress PE.

   It is desirable that based on an analysis of the two load balance
   mechanisms, one will chosen as the method to persue.  If consensus is
   reached that only one method is needed this document will be
   simplified by removing the dataplane and signaling test that
   describes the alternative solution.

8.  Security Considerations

   The pseudowire generic security considerations described in [10] and
   the security considerations applicable to a specific pseudowire type
   (for example, in the case of an Ethernet pseudowire [9] apply.

   There are no additional security risks introduced by this design.


9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate the next available values from the IETF
   Consensus range in the Pseudowire Interface Parameters Sub-TLV type
   Registry as a Load Balance Label indicator.

   Parameter  Length       Description

   TBD         4            Load Balancing Label
   TBD        12            Load Balance VC Block


10.  Congestion Considerations

   The congestion considerations applicable to pseudowires as described
   in [10] and any additional congestion considerations developed at the
   time of publication apply to this design.

   The ability to explicitly configure a PW to leverage the availability
   of multiple ECMP paths is beneficial to capacity planning as, all
   other parameters being constant, the statistical multiplexing of a
   larger number of smaller flows is more efficient than with a smaller
   number of larger flows.

   Note that if the classification into flows is only performed on IP
   packets the behaviour of those flows in the face of congestion will
   be as already defined by the IETF for packets of that type and no
   additional congestion processing is required.

   Where flows that are not IP are classified pseudowire congestion
   avoidance must be applied to each non-IP load balance group.
