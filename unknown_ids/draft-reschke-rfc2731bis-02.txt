1.  Introduction

   [RFC2731] defines "Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML".  Newer
   specifications published by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative [1]
   (DCMI), in particular "Expressing Dublin Core metadata using HTML/
   XHTML meta and link elements" (DC-HTML,
   <http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-html/>), have obsoleted this
   work.

      Note: Implementers of RFC 2731 should note that DC-HTML introduces
      a new requirement with respect to the use of the "head" element's
      "profile" attribute.


2.  Recommendation to Reclassify RFC 2731

   This document recommends that the IESG reclassify [RFC2731] as
   Historic.


3.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations related to this document.


4.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations related to this document.
