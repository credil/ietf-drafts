Abstract 

   The Link Management Protocol (LMP) is used to coordinate the 
   properties, use, and faults of data links in Generalized 
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. Various proposals 
   have been advanced to provide extensions to the base LMP 
   specification. This document defines an extension to negotiate 
   capabilities and support for those extensions, and provides a 
   generic procedure for LMP implementations that do not recognize or 
   do not support any one of these extensions.

1. Introduction 

   The Link Management Protocol (LMP) [RFC4204] has been successfully 
   deployed in Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS)-
   controlled networks. 

   New LMP behaviors and protocol extensions have been introduced in a 
   number of IETF documents as set out later in this section. It is 
   likely that future extensions will be made to support additional 
   functions.

   In the network, if one GMPLS Label Switch Router (LSR) supports a 
   new behavior or protocol extension, but its peer LSR does not, it is 
   necessary to have a protocol mechanism for resolving issues that may 
   arise. It is also beneficial to have a protocol mechanism to 
   discover the capabilities of peer LSRs so that the right protocol 
   extensions can be selected and the correct features enabled. There 
   are no such procedures defined in the base LMP specification 
   [RFC4204], so this document defines how to handle LMP extensions 
   both at legacy LSRs and at upgraded LSRs that would communicate with 
   legacy LSRs. 

   In [RFC4204], the basic behaviors have been defined around the use 
   of the standard LMP messages, which include Config, Hello, Verify, 
   Test, LinkSummary, and ChannelStatus. Per [RCF4204], these behaviors 
   MUST be supported when LMP is implemented, and the message types 
   from 1 to 20 have been assigned by IANA for these messages. 

   In [RFC4207], the SONET/SDH technology-specific behavior and 
   information for LMP is defined. The Trace behavior is added to LMP, 
   and the message types from 21 to 31 were assigned by IANA for the 
   messages that provide the TRACE function. The Trace function has 
   been extended for the support of OTNs (Optical Transport Networks) 
   in [LMP-TEST]. 

   In [RFC4209], extensions to LMP are defined to allow it to be used 
   between a peer node and an adjacent Optical Line System (OLS). The 
   LMP object class type and sub-object class name have been extended 
   to support DWDM behavior. 

   In [RFC5818], the data channel consistency check behavior is defined, 
   and the message types from 32 to 34 have been assigned by IANA for 
   messages that provide this behavior. 

   It is likely that future extensions to LMP for other functions or 
   technologies will require the definition of further LMP messages. 

   This document describes the behavior negotiation procedure to make 
   sure both LSRs at the ends of each link understand the LMP messages 
   that they exchange. 

    

2. LMP Behavior Negotiation Procedure 

   The Config message is used in the control channel negotiation phase 
   of LMP [RFC4204]. The LMP behavior negotiation procedure is defined 
   in this document as an addition to this phase.

draft-ietf-ccamp-lmp-behavior-negotiation-03.txt            April 2011 
    

   The Config message is defined in Section 12.3.1 of [RFC4204] and 
   carries the <CONFIG> object (class name 6) as defined in Section 
   13.6 of [RFC4204].  

   Two class types have been defined: 

   - C-Type = 1, HelloConfig, defined in [RFC4204] 

   - C-Type = 2, LMP_WDM_CONFIG, defined in [RFC4209] 

   This document defines a third C-Type with value 3 (TBD by IANA) to 
   report and negotiate currently defined LMP mechanisms and behaviors, 
   and to allow future LMP extensions to be reported and negotiated. 

   - C-Type = 3, BEHAVIOR_CONFIG 

   The format of the new type of CONFIG Class is defined as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3  
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |    Length     |B|S|D|C|            MUST_BE_ZERO               | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   Length: 8 bits 

      This field indicates the total length of the objects expressed in 
      multiples of 4 bytes. 

   Flags: 

     B: 1 bit 

      This bit indicates support for the basic behaviors defined in 
     [RFC4204]. 

     S: 1 bit 

      This bit indicates support for the Trace behavior of SONET/SDH 
     technology-specific defined in [RFC4207].  

     D: 1 bit 

      This bit indicates support for the DWDM behavior defined in 
     [RFC4209].

draft-ietf-ccamp-lmp-behavior-negotiation-03.txt            April 2011 
    

     C: 1 bit 

      This bit indicates support for the data channel consistency check 
      behavior defined in [RFC5818]. 

   Further bits may be defined in future documents. 

   The MUST_BE_ZERO field MUST be sent as zero and MUST NOT be ignored 
   on receipt. This allows the detection of unsupported or unknown LMP 
   behaviors when new bits are allocated to indicate further 
   capabilities and are sent as one. 

   Upon receiving a bit set related to an unsupported or unknown 
   behavior, a ConfigNack message MUST be sent with a <CONFIG> object, 
   the BEHAVIOR_CONFIG C-Type representing the supported LMP behaviors. 
   An LSR receiving such a ConfigNack SHOULD select a supported set of 
   capabilities and send a further Config message, or MAY raise an 
   alert to the management system (or log an error) and stop trying to 
   perform LMP communications with its neighbor. 

   Note that multiple <CONFIG> objects (each with a different Class 
   Type) MAY be present on a Config message in which case all of the 
   objects SHOULD be processed, but see the note on backward 
   compatibility in the next section. However, if more than one 
   <CONFIG> object with the same Class Type is present on a Config 
   message, the message SHOULD be rejected. 

    

3. Backward Compatibility 

   An LSR that receives a Config message containing a <CONFIG> object 
   with a C-Type that it does not recognize should respond with a 
   ConfigNack message as described in [RFC4204]. Thus, legacy LMP nodes 
   that do not support the BEHAVIOR_CONFIG C-Type defined in this 
   document will respond with a ConfigNack message. 

   Note that [RFC4204] does not describe how multiple <CONFIG> objects 
   with different C-Types should be processed. Thus it is possible that 
   a legacy node receiving a BEHAVIOR_CONFIG object on a Config message 
   that also includes a HelloConfig or LMP_WDM_CONFIG object might 
   react as follows: 

   - Reject the message because of the unknown BEHAVIOR_CONFIG object 
      as described above.

draft-ietf-ccamp-lmp-behavior-negotiation-03.txt            April 2011 
    

   - Reject the message because of multiple <CONFIG> objects. This 
      achieves the same effective result. 

   - Ignore the second <CONFIG> object. This would result in the 
      BEHAVIOR_CONFIG object being unprocessed and also not rejected. 

   An LSR that receives a ConfigNack message rejecting a Config message 
   that it sent containing the BEHAVIOR CONFIG C-Type because that 
   object variant is not supported by its peer MUST NOT draw any 
   conclusions about the level of support at the peer for LMP options 
   described by bits B, S, D, and C. Instead, the LSR MUST revert to 
   current practices of configuration or discovery through attempts to 
   exercise the options. 

   However, as future documents are published describing new LMP 
   features, and those documents require support of the BEHAVIOR CONFIG 
   C-Type, an LSR that receives a ConfigNack message rejecting a Config 
   message that it sent containing the BEHAVIOR CONFIG C-Type because 
   that object variant is not supported by its peer SHOULD conclude 
   that the additional options it wants to use are not supported by the 
   peer. 

    

4. Security Considerations 

   [RFC4204] describes how LMP messages between peers can be secured, 
   and these measures are equally applicable to messages carrying the 
   new <CONFIG> object defined in this document.  

   The operation of the procedures described in this document does not 
   of itself constitute a security risk since they do not cause any 
   change in network state. It would be possible, if the messages were 
   intercepted or spoofed to cause bogus alerts in the management plane, 
   or to cause LMP peers to consider that they could or could not 
   operate protocol extensions, and so the use of the LMP security 
   measures are RECOMMENDED. 

   Note, however, that [RFC4204] refers to [RFC2401], which has been 
   replaced by [RFC4301]. Also, the reference to IKEv2 in [RFC4301] is 
   out of date, and the current reference for IKEv2 is [RFC5996].

5. IANA Considerations 

5.1. New LMP Class Type 

   IANA maintains the "Link Management Protocol (LMP)" registry which 
   has a subregistry called "LMP Object Class name space and Class type 
   (C-Type)". 

   IANA is requested to make an assignment from this registry as 
   follows: 

      6   CONFIG                              [RFC4204] 

   CONFIG Object Class type name space: 

   C-Type   Description                    Reference  
   ------   ------------------------       ---------  
        3   BEHAVIOR_CONFIG                [This.I-D] 
    
5.2. New Capabilities Registry 

   IANA is requested to create a new subregistry of the "Link 
   Management Protocol (LMP)" registry to track the Behaviour 
   Configuration bits defined in Section 2 of this document. It is 
   suggested that this registry be called "LMP Behaviour Configuration 
   Flags". 

   Allocations from this registry are by Standards Action. 

   Bits in this registry are numbered from zero as the most significant 
   bit (transmitted first). The number of bits that can be present is 
   limited by the length field of the <CONFIG> object which gives rise 
   to (255 x 32)-8 = 8152. IANA is strongly recommended to allocate new 
   bits with the lowest available unused number. 

   The registry is initially populated as follows: 

   Bit    | Bit  | Meaning                                | Reference 
   Number | Name |                                        |  
   -------+------+----------------------------------------+---------- 
     0    |   B  | Basic LMP behavior support             | [This.ID] 
     1    |   S  | SONET/SDH Test support                 | [This.ID] 
     2    |   D  | DWDM support                           | [This.ID] 
     3    |   C  | Data Channel consistency check support | [This.ID]
