Abstract

   The NETCONF protocol defines the lock and unlock RPCs that lock
   entire configuration datastores.  In some situations, a way to lock
   only parts of a configuration datastore is required.  This document
   defines a capability-based extension to the NETCONF protocol for
   locking portions of a configuration datastore.

Internet-Draft        Partial Lock RPC for NETCONF         February 2008


1.  Introduction

   The NETCONF protocol [RFC4741] describes the lock and unlock RPCs
   that operate on entire configuration datastores.  Often, multiple
   management sessions need to be able to modify the configuration of a
   managed device in parallel.  In these cases, locking only parts of a
   configuration datastore is needed.  This document defines an
   extension to the NETCONF protocol to allow this.

   The mechanism for partial locking is based on the existing XPath
   filtering mechanisms.

   Partial locking is defined as a capability to NETCONF.

1.1.  Definition of Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, [RFC2119].


2.  Partial Locking Capability

2.1.  Overview

   The :partial-lock capability indicates that the device supports the
   locking of its configuration with a scope smaller then a complete
   configuration datastore.  The scope to be locked is specified by
   using restricted or full XPath expressions.  Partial locking covers
   configuration data, but not state data.

   The system ensures that configuration resources covered by the lock
   are not be modified by other NETCONF or non-NETCONF management
   operations such as SNMP and the CLI.

   The duration of the partial lock is defined as beginning when the
   partial lock is granted and lasting until either the corresponding
   <partial-unlock> operation succeeds or the NETCONF session
   terminates.

   A NETCONF session MAY have multiple parts of one or more datastores
   locked using partial lock operations.  The <partial-lock> operation
   returns a lock-id to identify each successfully acquired lock.

2.2.  Dependencies

   Partial locking uses only restricted XPath expressions to describe
   the lock's scope, as described in Section 2.4.1 for the select
   element.  However if optionally the :xpath capability is also
   supported, partial locking can utilize any Xpath 1.0 expression.

2.3.  Capability Identifier

   urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:partial-lock:1.0

2.4.  New Operations

2.4.1.  <partial-lock>

   The <partial-lock> operation allows the client to lock a portion of a
   data store.  The portion to lock is specified by using XPath
   expressions in the select elements of the <partial-lock> operation.
   Each XPath expression MUST return a node set.

   The select XPath expressions are evaluated only once at lock time,
   thereafter the scope of the lock is maintained as a set of nodes.  If
   the configuration data is later altered in a way that would make the
   original select XPath expressions evaluate to a different set of
   nodes, this does not affect the scope of the partial lock.

   XPath is only used for the creation of the partial lock.
   Conceptually the scope of the lock is defined by the returned nodeset
   and not by the XPath expression.

   A <partial-lock> operation MUST be handled atomically by the NETCONF
   server.  The server either locks all requested parts of the data
   store or none.

   If a node is locked by a session, only that same session is able to
   modify that node or any node in the subtree underneath it.

   If a top level node of a locked subtree is deleted, any other session
   can recreate it, as it is not covered by the lock anymore.

   A partial lock MUST fail if:

   o  Any NETCONF session (including the current session) owns the
      global lock on the datastore.

   o  Any part of the scope to be locked is already locked by another
      management session/protocol, including other NETCONF sessions
      using the <partial-lock> or any other non-NETCONF management

      method.

   o  The NETCONF server implements access control and the locking user
      does not have at least some basic access rights, e.g., read
      rights, to all of the datastore section to be locked.  The exact
      handling of access rights is outside the scope of this document,
      but it is assumed that there is an access control system that MAY
      deny or allow the partial lock operation.

   As with most locking systems, there is a possibility that two users
   trying to lock different parts of the configuration become dead-
   locked.  To avoid this situation, clients SHOULD lock everything they
   need in one operation.  If that operation still fails, the client
   SHOULD back down, release any already acquired locks, and retry the
   procedure after some time interval.  The length of the interval
   should preferably be random to avoid repeated dead-locks when both
   (or all) clients back down and then repeat locking.

   It is the intention to keep partial-locking simple, so when a partial
   lock is executed you get what you asked for: a set of nodes that are
   locked for writing.  There are some other issues that are
   intentionally not addressed for the sake of simplicity.

   o  Locking does not effect read operations.

   o  If a part of a datastore is locked, this has no effect on any
      unlocked parts of the datastore.  If this is a problem e.g. the
      operator's changes depend on data values in the unlocked part of
      the datastore, the operator should include these values in the
      scope of the lock.

   o  An operator is allowed to edit the configuration both inside and
      outside the scope of a lock.  It is the operator's responsibility
      to lock all parts of the datastore that are crucial for a specific
      management action.


   Note: The <partial-lock> operation does not modify the global <lock>
   operation defined in the base NETCONF Protocol [RFC4741].  If part of
   a datastore is already locked by <partial-lock>, then a global lock
   for that datastore fails even if the global lock is attempted by the
   same NETCONF session which owns the partial-lock.

   Parameters:

   target:  Name of the configuration datastore of which a part shall be
       locked.  URLs are not accepted.

   select:  One or more 'select' elements each containing an XPath
       expression.  The XPath expression is evaluated in a context where
       the context node is the root of the server's conceptual data
       model, and the set of namespace declarations are those in scope
       on the select element.

       The select expressions MUST return a node set.

       If the device supports the :xpath capability as well any valid
       XPath 1.0 expression can be used, if not, the XPath expression
       MUST be limited to an Instance Identifier expression [Editor's
       Note: add text or reference].  An Instance Identifier is an
       absolute path expression in abbreviated syntax, where predicates
       are used only to specify values for nodes defined as keys to
       distinguish multiple instances.]

   Example: Lock virtual router 1 and interface eth1


   <nc:rpc
     xmlns:nc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
     xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:partial-lock:1.0"

   If the device was able to satisfy the request, an <rpc-reply> is sent
   with a <lock-id> element (lock identifier) in the <data> element.

   Negative Response:

   If a lock is already held on any node within the subtrees to be
   locked, the <error-tag> element shall be 'lock-denied' and the
   <error-info> element shall include the <session-id> of the lock
   owner.  If the lock is held by a non-NETCONF entity, a <session-id>
   of 0 (zero) is included.

   If the select expressions return an empty node set, the <error-tag>
   shall be 'operation-failed', and the <error-app-tag> shall be 'no-
   matches'.

   If any select expression returns anything but a node set, the <error-
   tag> shall be 'invalid-value'.

   If the :xpath capability is not supported and the XPath expression is
   not an Instance Identifier, the <error-tag> shall be 'invalid-value'.

   If access control denies the partial lock, the <error-tag> shall be
   'access-denied'.


2.4.2.  <partial-unlock>

   The operation unlocks a part of a datastore that was previously
   locked using <partial-lock> during the same session.

   Parameters:

   lock-id:  Lock identifier to unlock; taken from a reply to a previous
       <partial-lock> operation.

   Example: Unlock


   <nc:rpc xmlns:nc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:partial-lock:1.0"
       nc:message-id="136">
       <partial-unlock>
           <lock-id>127</lock-id>
       </partial-unlock>
   </nc:rpc>

   Positive Response:

   If the device was able to satisfy the request, an <rpc-reply> is sent
   that contains an <ok> element.  A positive response MUST be sent even
   if all of the locked part of the datastore has already been deleted.

   Negative Response:

   If the <lock-id> parameter does not identify a lock which is owned by
   the session, an 'invalid-value' error is returned.

2.5.  Modifications to Existing Operations

   None.

2.6.  Interactions with Other Capabilities

2.6.1.  Writable-Running Capability

   Partial locking of the running datastore can only be done if the
   :writable-running capability is supported by the device.

2.6.2.  Candidate Configuration Capability

   Partial locking of the candidate datastore can only be done if the
   :candidate capability is supported by the device.  The partial
   locking of the candidate datastore does not depend on whether the
   datastore was modified or not.

2.6.3.  Distinct Startup Capability

   Partial locking of the startup datastore can only be done if the
   :startup capability is supported by the device.


3.  Security Considerations

   The same considerations as for the base NETCONF Protocol [RFC4741]
   are valid.  It is assumed that the <partial-lock> and <partial-
   unlock> RPCs are only allowed for an authenticated user after passing
   some access control mechanism.

5.  Appendix A  -  Change Log

5.1.  Open Issues

      Shall we allow the locking of non-existent nodes?  The operator
      might want to reserve an object or rather its key/name even if he
      will create the object later.

      Should we include more detailed information in error results to
      help debug lock conflicts, e.g. the userId of the conflicting
      session, the XPath expression of the conflicting session, the
      instanceId of the first object where the lock conflict was found?

      Should we allow users to lock parts of multiple datastores (e.g.
      /top/routing both in the candidate and the running datastore) in
      one operation?  This would decrease the probability of a dead-
      lock, but currently the (global) <lock> operation doesn't support
      this.

5.2.  -00

5.3.  00-01
