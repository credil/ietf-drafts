INTERNET DRAFT           The tn3270 URI scheme         November 25, 2010


1 Introduction

   The tn3270 URI scheme was firstly mentioned in RFC 1738 [RFC1738] in
   order to be registered as 'Provisional' URI scheme. However there are
   no acceptable and clear specifications so far.

   This document gives such specification of syntax, semantics and use
   of tn3270 URI scheme.

2 Scheme Definition 

   The tn3270 URI scheme is used to access services that are provided
   via TN3270 Telnet Service - Interactive 3270 emulation session. In
   fact this is Telnet service with special data transfer mode so the
   form of URI is similar to that of telnet one.

   The tn3270 URI takes the following form (given in ABNF, as described
   in RFC 5234 [RFC5234]):

   tn3270_uri = "tn3270:" "//" [user ":" password] host [":" port] [/]
         user = <user name for authorization>
     password = <password for authorization>
         host = <the host name that the request is being made to>
         port = 1*5DIGIT

   The final character "/" can be omitted. The "user:password" pair can
   be omitted as well as "port" (if it is omitted, defaults to 23 -
   default Telnet port).

3 Security Considerations

   There are many security consideration for tn3270 URI scheme defined
   in RFC 4248 [RFC4248] - the specification of telnet URI scheme, which
   concern tn3270 one as well. 

4 IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to move the tn3270 URI scheme registration from
   'Provisional' to 'Permanent'.
