        This document describes a format for distributing security policy
        statments.
      </t>
      <t>
        Individual security policy statements are expressed in a HTTP
        compatible header syntax. Lists of security policy statements
        are exchanged as signed CMS objects. Strong references to 
        static data objects are formed using Named Information (ni)
        URI specifiers.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Recent compromises of critical infrastructure have highlighted the weaknesses
        that result from the fact that on the Internet, security is an option, not
        the default.
      </t>
      <t>
        Security Policy provides a mechanism for advising parties of the minimum
        degree of security that they should accept for a communication and thus
        preventing downgrade attacks.
      </t>
      <section title="Requirements">
        <t>
          Security Policy statements provide a mechanism for advising parties of
          the risk of a downgrade attack and the enforcement actions that are
          appropriate based on the quality of the security policy information
          available.
        </t>
        <t>
          While the natural inclination of security specialists is to advise that
          a security policy violation always result in a hard failure with the
          corresponding transaction being aborted, this approach imposes a 
          high cost for false positives. Previous attempts to employ security
          policy data (e.g. in DKIM) have faced objections from those fearing
          that the false positive rate will be unacceptably high.
        </t>
        <t>
          Recent events have demonstrated that the value of reporting a security
          policy violation is considerably higher than than security policy
          enforcement on a limited scale. While security policy enforcement has the
          potential to protect the individual Internet user, reporting a
          violation to the appropriate parties has the potential to protect the
          entire community of Internet users.
        </t>
        <section title="Protocol Downgrade Attack">
          <t>
            In a protocol downgrade attack the attacker causes client software
            to communicate en-clair when TLS or some other security enhancement
            is offered.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="CA Downgrade Attack">
          <t>
            In a CA downgrade attack the attacker applies for a certificate from
            a different issuer to that authorized by the Domain name holder or
            for a category of certificate with lest strict validation requirements.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Use of Revoked Certificate">
          <t>
            Although PKIX specifies two mechanisms for certificate status checking,
            many clients will accept certificates when access to the certificate
            status checking infrastructure fails.
          </t>
          <section title="Use of Expired Certificate">
            <t>
              Although use of expired certificates is discouraged, the frequency
              with which use of expired certificates occurs from administrative
              oversight prevents strict enforcement.
            </t>
          </section>

        </section>
        <section title="Security Policy Origination">
          <t>
            Security policy statements may be obtained from explicit statements
            by domain name holders or obtained heuristically from observation
            of the network.
          </t>
          <section title="Explicit">
            <t>
              A domain name holder MAY specify security policy explicitly through
              publication mechanisms that include:
            </t>
            <t>
              <list>
                <t>
                  Publishing statements in Security Policy Distribution Format
                </t>
                <t>
                  Security Policy Statements in HTTP headers
                </t>
                <t>
                  Security Policy Statements in DNS records
                </t>
                <t>
                  Out of band contact with remediation parties.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Statements to a Certification Authority at certificate issue.
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>
              Even though a statement is explicit, an enforcement point may
              only learn of its existence through heuristic means. For example
              observing DNS traffic, use of Web crawlers and HTTPS inspection.
            </t>
            <t>
              Publication of an explicit Security policy Statement requires a
              considerable commitment of time and effort for a large site.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Heuristic">
            <t>
              Security policy data MAY also be determined heuristically by
              observation of network traffic. If a site has been using a particular
              CA for many years and a certificate is suddenly detected from an
              obscure issuer, questions may be asked.
            </t>
            <t>
              While the quality of heuristic data may fall short of that
              required to abort transactions by itself, it can still
              provide a useful basis for reporting potential violations and
              for enforcement when combined with data from other sources.
            </t>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section title="Security Policy Distribution">
          <t>
            Security policy can be distributed through multiple channels.
            The best choice of channel depends on the information in
            question and the application.
          </t>
          <section title="Embedded">
            <t>
              The Security Policy is embedded in client or operating system
              code. This approach has traditionally been limited to embedding
              revocation notices for certificates that have been known to be
              fraudulently issued.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="In-Band">
            <t>
              The security policy data is carried in the protocol to which
              the policy applies. E.G HTTP headers for a HTTP transaction.
              One drawback to this approach is that it only provides 'secure
              after first contact'.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="DNS">
            <t>
              The DNS has been used to distribute Security Policy Statements.
              The principle drawback being that deployment of DNSSEC is
              immature and likely to be blocked in the regions where
              security policy is most needed.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Data Driven Update">
            <t>
              The format described in this document is designed to support data
              driven update.
            </t>
            <t>
              The main limitation to this approach is that it does not scale.
              Thus the use of the distribution format should be limited to
              distributing policy for the domains that carry the highest risk.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Irregular">
            <t>
              Security Policy distribution is hard because the adversaries
              encountered to date include nation state actors with complete
              control of the local network infrastructure. It is thus not
              possible to address every possible need in a standard based
              approach since the adversary  can block deployment of the
              necessary standards.
            </t>
            <t>
              It follows that standards based techniques SHOULD be
              supplemented by resort to irregular methods where necessary.

          <section title="Unpin=&lt;uri&gt;">
            <t>
              A Named Information URI that specifies the digest of an unpinning
              value. Disclosure of the unpinning value has the effect of
              revoking the corresponding security policy statement to which
              it is attached.
            </t>
            <t>
              The unpinning value SHOULD be a randomly chosen nonce with sufficient
              ergodicity to make determination by brute force attack infeasible.

          </section>
        </section>
        <section title="Statement: Unpin: &lt;data&gt;">
          <t>
            An unpinning value for a previously distributed CA pinning statement
            encoded as Base64.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Statement: Revoke: &lt;uri&gt;">
          <t>
            The Revoke statement is used to declare that a certificate is invalid.
          </t>
          <t>
            While the functionality of the Revoke statement overlaps the
            capabilities and functionality of the existing PKIX revocation
            schemes (CRLs and OCSP), it is intended for a different field of
            use.
          </t>
          <t>
            In particular the Revoke statement SHOULD NOT be employed except  
            as a last resort mechanism for use in situations that are not 
            adequately addressed by the existing certificate status infrastructure
            and the risk of relying on the revoked certificate is unacceptably
            high.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Statement: Action: &lt;action&gt;">
          <t>
            Specifies the action that SHOULD be performed in the case that a security
            policy violation is detected. Valid actions are 'Ignore', 'Advise',
            'Fail' and 'Block':

            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="Ignore">
                The client SHOULD ignore policy violations. This option is intended
                for use in testing Security Policy configuration prior to requesting
                enforcement.
              </t>
              <t hangText="Advise">
                The client SHOULD advise the user when policy violations occur but not
                impede access to the corresponding network resource. 
              </t>
              <t hangText="Fail">
                The client SHOULD advise the user that a policy violation has occurred
                and discourage (but not prevent) access to the corresponding network resource.

              <t hangText="Block">
                The client SHOULD advise the user that a policy violation has occurred

            requests.

            Additional parameters MAY be specified to further control the mode
            of use of TLS. For example the minimum version of the protocol to
            be used. [[While this could be extended to include cipher suites it
            is believed that the existing protocol is sufficiently proofed
            against downgrade attack on cipher suites. If this should be found 
            not to be the case it would likely drive an urgent update of the 
            protocol version.]]
