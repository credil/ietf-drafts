		</section>
		<section title="Introduction">
			<t> Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an
   architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize
   information exchange between the control plane and the forwarding
   plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES NE).  <xref target="RFC3654"/> has defined
   the ForCES requirements, and <xref target="RFC3746"/>  has defined the ForCES
   framework.</t>
			<section title="ForCES Protocol">
				<t>The ForCES protocol works in a master-slave mode in which FEs are slaves and CEs
   are masters.  The protocol includes commands for transport of Logical Function Block (LFB) configuration information, association setup,
   status, and event notifications, etc. The reader is encouraged to read <xref target="I-D.ietf-forces-protocol">FE-protocol</xref> for further
   information.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="ForCES Model">
				<t>The <xref target="I-D.ietf-forces-model">FE-MODEL</xref> presents a formal way to define FE
   Logical Function Blocks (LFBs) using XML.  LFB configuration
   components, capabilities, and associated events are defined when the
   LFB is formally created.  The LFBs within the FE are accordingly
   controlled in a standardized way by the ForCES protocol.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Transport mapping layer">
				<t>The TML transports the PL messages.  The TML is where the issues of
   how to achieve transport level reliability, congestion control,
   multicast, ordering, etc. are handled.  It is expected that more than
   one TML will be standardized.  The various possible TMLs could vary
   their implementations based on the capabilities of underlying media
   and transport.  However, since each TML is standardized,
   interoperability is guaranteed as long as both endpoints support the
   same TML.  All ForCES Protocol Layer implementations MUST be portable
  across all TMLs.  Although more than one TML may be standardized
  for the ForCES Protocol, for the purposes of the interoperability test,
  the mandated MUST IMPLEMENT SCTP TML <xref target="RFC3654"/>
   will be used.</t>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section title="Definitions">
			<t> This document follows the terminology defined by the ForCES
   Requirements in <xref target="RFC3654"/> and by the ForCES framework in <xref target="RFC3746"/>.
   The definitions below are repeated below for clarity.</t>
			<t>
				<list style="hanging">
					<t>Control Element (CE) - A logical entity that implements the ForCES
   protocol and uses it to instruct one or more FEs on how to process
   packets.  CEs handle functionality such as the execution of control
   and signaling protocols.</t>
					<t>CE Manager (CEM) - A logical entity responsible for generic CE
   management tasks.  It is particularly used during the pre-association
   phase to determine with which FE(s) a CE should communicate.  This
   process is called FE discovery and may involve the CE manager
   learning the capabilities of available FEs.</t>
					<t>Forwarding Element (FE) - A logical entity that implements the ForCES
   protocol.  FEs use the underlying hardware to provide per-packet
   processing and handling as directed/controlled by one or more CEs via
   the ForCES protocol.</t>
					<t>FE Manager (FEM) - A logical entity responsible for generic FE
   management tasks.  It is used during pre-association phase to
   determine with which CE(s) an FE should communicate.  This process is
   called CE discovery and may involve the FE manager learning the
   capabilities of available CEs.  An FE manager may use anything from a
   static configuration to a pre-association phase protocol (see below)
   to determine which CE(s) to use.  Being a logical entity, an FE
   manager might be physically combined with any of the other logical
   entities such as FEs.</t>
					<t>ForCES Network Element (NE) - An entity composed of one or more CEs
   and one or more FEs.  To entities outside an NE, the NE represents a
   single point of management.  Similarly, an NE usually hides its
   internal organization from external entities.</t>
					<t>LFB (Logical Function Block) - The basic building block that is
   operated on by the ForCES protocol.  The LFB is a well defined,
   logically separable functional block that resides in an FE and is
   controlled by the CE via ForCES protocol.  The LFB may reside at the
   FE's datapath and process packets or may be purely an FE control or
   configuration entity that is operated on by the CE.  Note that the
   LFB is a functionally accurate abstraction of the FE's processing
   capabilities, but not a hardware-accurate representation of the FE
   implementation.</t>
					<t>FE Topology - A representation of how the multiple FEs within a
   single NE are interconnected.  Sometimes this is called inter-FE
   topology, to be distinguished from intra-FE topology (i.e., LFB
   topology).</t>
					<t>LFB Class and LFB Instance - LFBs are categorized by LFB Classes.  An
   LFB Instance represents an LFB Class (or Type) existence.  There may
   be multiple instances of the same LFB Class (or Type) in an FE.  An
   LFB Class is represented by an LFB Class ID, and an LFB Instance is
   represented by an LFB Instance ID.  As a result, an LFB Class ID
   associated with an LFB Instance ID uniquely specifies an LFB
   existence.</t>
					<t>LFB Metadata - Metadata is used to communicate per-packet state from
   one LFB to another, but is not sent across the network.  The FE model
   defines how such metadata is identified, produced and consumed by the
   LFBs.  It defines the functionality but not how metadata is encoded
   within an implementation.</t>
					<t>LFB Component - Operational parameters of the LFBs that must be
   visible to the CEs are conceptualized in the FE model as the LFB
   components.  The LFB components include, for example, flags, single
   parameter arguments, complex arguments, and tables that the CE can
   read and/or write via the ForCES protocol (see below).</t>
					<t>LFB Topology - Representation of how the LFB instances are logically
   interconnected and placed along the datapath within one FE. Sometimes
    it is also called intra-FE topology, to be distinguished from inter-FE topology.</t>
					<t>Pre-association Phase - The period of time during which an FE Manager
   and a CE Manager are determining which FE(s) and CE(s) should be part
   of the same network element.</t>
					<t>Post-association Phase - The period of time during which an FE knows
   which CE is to control it and vice versa.  This includes the time
   during which the CE and FE are establishing communication with one
   another.</t>
					<t>ForCES Protocol - While there may be multiple protocols used within
   the overall ForCES architecture, the term "ForCES protocol" and
   "protocol" refer to the Fp reference points in the ForCES Framework
   in [RFC3746].  This protocol does not apply to CE-to-CE
   communication, FE-to-FE communication, or to communication between FE
   and CE managers.  Basically, the ForCES protocol works in a master-
   slave mode in which FEs are slaves and CEs are masters.  This
   document defines the specifications for this ForCES protocol.</t>
					<t>ForCES Protocol Transport Mapping Layer (ForCES TML) - A layer in
   ForCES protocol architecture that uses the capabilities of existing
   transport protocols to specifically address protocol message
   transportation issues, such as how the protocol messages are mapped
   to different transport media (like TCP, IP, ATM, Ethernet, etc), and
   how to achieve and implement reliability, multicast, ordering, etc.
   The ForCES TML specifications are detailed in separate ForCES
   documents, one for each TML.</t>

					<list style="numbers">
						<t>Renting a car and driving to the University. It is a maximum 2:30 hours drive from the aiport.</t>
						<t>Via coach station. Get from the airport to the coach station via X93 bus towards the Kifissos Coach Station. At the Coach Station there are buses to Patras every 30 minutes. The Bus to Patras may take about 2:30 - 3:00 hours, and the ride of the X93 bus may take about 30 mins - 1hour depending on the traffic, so it's about 3:30 - 4:30 hours away with the wait at the Coach Station.</t>
						<t>Via Train. It is recommended you already have booked your ticket beforehand as there are not many trains going to Patras, and mostly are booked in advanced. It is not recommended that you take the train to Patras, as you have to change at least 2 trains. In order to reach Patras from the Athens International Airport you need to take the Suburban Rail to Neratziotissa. From there you must take ISAP to Pireaus. There you must change again to Suburban Rail to reach Kiato. From Kiato you can catch a train to Patras. It will take you at least 5 hours to reach Patras.</t>

					<t>In the Association Setup Phase, the messages, FEO OperEnable Event (FE to CE), Config FEO Adminup (CE to FE) and FEO Config-Resp (FE to CE) will be ignored. The CE will assume that the FE is enabled once the LFBSelectors has been queried.</t>

					<t>There will be no transaction operations.</t>
					<t>Each message shall have only one LFBSelector TLV, one Operation TLV and one PathDataTLV per message when these are used.</t>
				</list></t>
			<section title="Scenario 1 - Pre-association Setup">
				<t>While the Pre-association setup is not in the ForCES current scope it is an
      essential step before CEs and FEs communicate. As the first part in a successfull CE-FE connection
      the participating CEs and FEs should be able to be configured.</t>

      <t>In the Pre-association Phase the following configuration items MUST be setup regarding the CEs:</t>

					<list style="symbols">
						<t>The CE ID.</t>
						<t>The FE IDs that will be connected to this CE</t>
						<t>The IP of the FEs that will connect</t>

			<section title="Scenario 2 - TML priority channels connection">
				<t>For the current interoperability test, the SCTP will be used as TML.
			The TML connection with the associating element is needed for the scenario 2 to be successful.</t>
				<t>The <xref target="I-D.ietf-forces-sctptml">SCTP-TML draft</xref> defines 3 priority channels, with specific ports:</t>
				<t>

		In this stage the FE is continuously updated or queried. The CE should query the FE a specific value from the FE Object LFB and from the FE Protocol LFB.
		An example from the FE Protocol LFB is the HeartBeat Timer (FEHI) and from the FE Object LFB is the State of the LFB (FEState)</t>

				<t>The Heartbeat (HB) Message is used for one ForCES element (FE or CE)
	   to asynchronously notify one or more other ForCES elements in the same ForCES NE on its liveness.
	  The default configuration of the Heartbeat Policy of the FE is set to 0 which means, that the FE should not generate any Heartbeat messages.
	   the CE is responsible for checking FE liveness by setting the PL header ACK flag of the message it sends to AlwaysACK.
	   In this Scenario the CE should send a Heartbeat message with the ACK flag set to AlwaysACK and the FE should respond.</t>

			<section title="Scenario 6 - Simple Config Command">
				<t>A config message is sent by the CE to the FE to configure LFB components in the FE. A simple config command easily visible and metered would be to change the Heartbeat configuration. This will be done in two steps:</t>
				<t>
					<list style="numbers">
						<t>Change the FE Heartbeat Policy (FEHBPolicy) to value 1, to force the FE to send heartbeats.</t>
						<t>After some heartbeats from the FE, the FE Heartbeat Interval (FEHI) will be changed.</t>
					</list>
				</t>
				<t>The following ForCES protocol messages will be exchanged:</t>
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>Config Message</t>
						<t>Config Response Message</t>
					</list>
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Scenario 7 - Association Teardown">
				<t>In the end, the association must be terminated. There are two scenarios by which the association maybe terminated:</t>
				<t>
					<list style="numbers">
						<t>Normal tear down by exchanging Association Teardown Message</t>
						<t>Irregular tear down by stopping heartbeats from a FE or a CE.</t>
						<t>Irregular tear down by externally shutting down/rebooting a FE or a CE.</t>
					</list>
				</t>
				<t>All scenarios may be tested in the interoperability test.</t>
				<t>The following ForCES protocol messages will be exchanged:</t>
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>Association Teardown Message</t>
					</list>

		<!-- References split into informative and normative -->
		<!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
