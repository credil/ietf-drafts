Abstract

   This document provides GMPLS OSPF routing enhancements to support
   signal compatibility constraints associated with WSON network
   elements. These routing enhancements are required in common optical
   or hybrid electro-optical networks where not all of the optical
   signals in the network are compatible with all network elements
   participating in the network.

   This compatibility constraint model is applicable to common optical
   or hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO switches, regenerators,
   and wavelength converters since such systems can be limited to
   processing only certain types of WSON signals.

Internet-Draft OSPF Enhancement for WSON Signal Compatibility  September
2010


   Disclaimer of Validity............................................8

            1. Introduction

   The documents [WSON-Frame, WSON-Info, RWA-Encode] explain how to
   extend the wavelength switched optical network (WSON) control plane
   to allow both multiple WSON signal types and common hybrid electro
   optical systems as well hybrid systems containing optical switching
   and electro-optical resources. In WSON, not all of the optical
   signals in the network are compatible with all network elements
   participating in the network. Therefore, signal compatibility is an
   important constraint in path computation in a WSON.

   This document provides GMPLS OSPF routing enhancements to support
   signal compatibility constraints associated with general WSON network
   elements. These routing enhancements are required in common optical
   or hybrid electro-optical networks where not all of the optical
   signals in the network are compatible with all network elements
   participating in the network.

   This compatibility constraint model is applicable to common optical
   or hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO switches, regenerators,
   and wavelength converters since such systems can be limited to
   processing only certain types of WSON signals.

       1.1. Revision History

   From 00 to 01: The details of the encodings for compatibility moved
   from this document to [RWA_Encode].

   From 01 to 02: Editorial changes.

            2. Compatibility and Accessibility Sub-TLVs

   The encodings described in [RWA-Encode] involve node level
   properties, rather than link level, and hence belong in an
   appropriate node oriented top level TLV. The OSPF TE LSA node
   attribute TLV of [OSPF-Node] is used for this purpose.

   This document defines four OSPF TE LSA node attribute sub-TLVs based
   on the encodings in [RWA-Encode]:

   TBA            variable    Resource Block Accessibility
   TBA            variable    Resource Block Wavelength Constraints
   TBA            variable    Resource Block Pool State

   The detail encodings of these sub-TLVs are found in [RWA-Encode] as
   indicated in the table below.

   Name                          Section[RWA-Encode]
   Resource Block Information             5.1
   Resource Block Accessibility           4.1
   Resource Block Wavelength Constraints  4.2
   Resource Block Pool State              4.3


   Among the sub-TLVs defined above, the Resource Block Pool State sub-
   TLV is dynamic in nature while the rest are static. As such, it will
   be separated out from the rest and make use of multiple TE LSA
   instances per source, per RFC3630 multiple instance capability.

       2.1. Resource Block Information sub-TLV

   There are seven nested sub-TLVs defined in the Resource Block
   Information sub-TLV.

   The detail encodings of these sub-TLVs are found in [RWA-Encode] as
   indicated in the table below.

3. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any further security issues other
   than those discussed in [RFC 3630], [RFC 4203].

4. IANA Considerations

   According to [RFC3630], the OSPF TE LSA and Types for sub-TLVs for
   each top level Types must be assigned by Expert Review, and must be
   registered with IANA.

   IANA is requested to allocate new Types for the sub-TLVs as defined
   in Sections 2 and 2.1 as follows:

4.1. Node Information

   This document introduces the following sub-TLVs of Node Attribute TLV
   (Value TBD, see [OSPF-Node])
