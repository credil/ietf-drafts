    LDP extensions for Explicit Pseudowire to transport LSP mapping
            draft-cao-pwe3-mpls-tp-pw-over-bidir-lsp-03.txt

Abstract

   A bidirectional Pseudowire (PW) service currently uses two
   unidirectional PWs each carried over a unidirectional LSP.  Each end
   point of a PW or segment of multi-segment PW (MS-PW) independently
   selects the LSP to use to carry the PW for which it is the head end.

   Some transport services may require that bidirectional PW traffic
   follows the same paths through the network in both directions.
   Therefore, PWs may be required to use LSP with congruent paths.
   Bidirectional LSPs or co-routed associated unidirectional LSPs allow
   this service to be provided.

   This document specifies an optional extension to LDP that allows both
   ends of a PW (or segment of a MS-PW) to select and bind to the same
   bidirectional LSP (or co-routed unidirectional LSPs).

Internet-Draft      Explicit PW to PSN Tunnel Binding          June 2011


1.  Introduction

   Pseudo Wire (PW) Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) [RFC3985] is a
   mechanism to emulate a number of layer 2 services, such as
   Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame Relay or Ethernet.  Such
   services are emulated between two Attachment Circuits (ACs) and the
   PW encapsulated layer 2 service payload is carried through Packet
   Switching Network (PSN) tunnels between Provider Edges (PEs).  Today
   PWE3 generally uses two reverse unidirectional Label Distribution
   Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036] or Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic
   Engineering (RSVP-TE) [RFC3209] LSPs as PSN tunnels, and each of the
   PEs selects and binds PSN tunnel independently.  There is no
   protocol-based provision to explicitly associate a PW with a specific
   PSN tunnel.

   For transport applications it has been identified that many transport
   services may require bidirectional traffic that follows congruent
   paths.  When bidirectional LSPs [RFC3471][RFC3473] are used as PSN
   tunnels, this requirement can be fulfilled if both PEs of a specific/
   segment PW select and bind to the same bidirectional LSPs.  In the
   case of unidirectional LSPs, LSPs with congruent paths need to be
   selected to support the PW.  However, current mechanisms cannot
   guarantee appropriate mapping of PWs to underlying LSPs.

   The lack of the control over LSP-PW binding may introduce service
   issues in operation, as shown in Figure 1.

          Figure 1: Inconsistent SS-PW to LSP binding scenario


   There are two bidirectional LSPs: LSP1 and LSP2, along diverse paths.
   A bidirectional PW service is offered between PE1 and PE2.  Using the
   existing mechanisms, it's possible that PE1 may select LSP1 (PE1-P1-
   P2-PE2) as the PSN tunnel for the PE1->PE2 direction of the PW, while
   PE2 may select LSP2 (PE1-P3-PE2) as the PSN tunnel for the PE2->PE1
   direction of the PW.

   Consequently, the bidirectional PW service is delivered over two
   disjoint LSPs, which may have completely different service attributes
   in terms of bandwidth and latency.  If service offering requires

   consistent traffic behavior on forward and reverse direction, this
   may not acceptable.

   The similar problems may also exist in bidirectional multi-segment
   PWs (MS-PWs), where user traffic on a particular PW may hop over
   different networks on forward and reverse directions.

   One way to solve this problem is by introducing manual configuration
   at each PE to bind the PWs and the underlying PSN tunnels.  However,
   this is prone to configuration errors and does not scale.

   In this documentation, we will introduce an automatic solution by
   extending FEC 128/129 PW based on [RFC4447].


2.  LDP Extensions

   This document defines a new TLV, PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, to
   communicate tunnel/LSPs selection and binding requests between PEs at
   the bi-directional PW's setup time.  The TLV carries PW's binding
   profile and provides both explicit and inexplicit information on the
   underlying PSN tunnels.

   The binding TLV is optional, and MUST NOT affect the existing PW
   operation when not present in the messages.

   The binding operation applies in both single-segment (SS) and multi-
   segment (MS) scenarios.

   Presently, the extension supports two types of binding requests:

   1.  Congruent binding: the requesting PE will ask the underlying LSPs
       to be congruent.

   2.  Strict binding: the requesting PE will choose and explicitly
       indicate both forwarding and reverse LSP's in the requests.

   In this document, the terminology of "tunnel" is identical to the "TE
   Tunnel" defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC3209], which is uniquely
   identified by a SESSION object that includes Tunnel end point
   address, Tunnel ID and Extended Tunnel ID.  The terminology "LSP" is
   identical to the "LSP tunnel" defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC3209],
   which is uniquely identified by the SESSION object together with
   SENDER_TEMPLATE (or FILTER_SPEC) object that consists of LSP ID and
   Tunnel end point address.

2.1.  PSN Tunnel Binding TLV

   PSN Tunnel Binding TLV is an optional TLV and MUST be carried in the
   LDP Label Mapping message if explicit PW to PSN tunnel binding is
   required.  The format of this TLV is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                   Figure 2: PSN Tunnel Binding TLV


   The PSN Tunnel Binding TLV type is to be allocated by IANA.

   The Length field is 2 octets in length.  It defines the length in
   octets of the entire TLV.

   The Flag field describes the binding requests, and has following
   format:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     MUST be Zero        |C|S|T|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Three flags have been defined at the present time.

   C (Congruent path) bit: This informs the remote T-PE/S-PEs about the
   properties of the underlying PSN tunnels.  When set, the remote T-PE/
   S-PEs need to select tunnel/LSPs with congruent paths (e.g., co-
   routed bidirectional LSP).  If there is no satisfied tunnel, it may
   trigger the remote T-PE/S-PEs to establish a new tunnel.

   S (Strict) bit: This instructs the PEs with respect to the handling
   of the underlying PSN tunnels.  When set, the remote PE MUST use the
   tunnel/LSPs specified in the PSN Tunnel Sub-TLV as the PSN tunnel on
   the reverse direction of the PW, or the PW will fail to be
   established.

   T (Tunnel Representation) bit: This indicates the format of the PSN
   tunnels.  When the bit is set, the PSN tunnel uses the tunnel
   information to identify itself, and the LSP Number fields in the PSN

   Tunnel sub-TLV (Section 2.1.1) MUST be set to zero.  Otherwise, both
   tunnel and LSP information of the PSN tunnel are required.  The
   default is set.

   C-bit and S-bit are mutually exclusive from each other, and cannot be
   set in the same message.

2.1.1.  PSN Tunnel Sub-TLV

   PSN Tunnel Sub-TLVs are designed for inclusion in the PSN Tunnel
   Binding TLV to specify the tunnel/LSPs to which a PW is required to
   bind.

   In this document two sub-TLVs are defined: the IPv4/IPv6 Tunnel sub-
   TLVs.  The format of the PSN Tunnel sub-TLVs is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

                   Figure 4: IPv6 PSN Tunnel sub-TLV format
   The definition of Source and Destination Global/Node IDs and Tunnel/
   LSP Numbers are derived from [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers].  The
   notation is designed to describe co-routed or bi-directional LSPs,
   which is suitable in the context of the work here.

   As defined in Section 4.6.1.2 and Section 4.6.2.2 of [RFC3209], the
   "Tunnel end point address" is mapped to Destination Node ID, and
   "Extended Tunnel ID" is mapped to Source Node ID.  Both IDs can be
   IPv6 addresses.

   A PSN Tunnel sub-TLV could be used to either identify a tunnel or a
   specific LSP.  The T-bit in the Flag field determines whether it
   stands for tunnel or LSP.

   When the T-bit is set, it identifies a tunnel, and the Source/
   Destination LSP Number fields MUST be set to zero and ignored during
   processing.  Otherwise, both Source/Destination LSP Number fields
   MUST have the actual LSP IDs of specific LSPs.

   Each PSN Tunnel Binding TLV can only have one such sub-TLV.


3.  Theory of Operation

   During PW setup, the PEs may select desired forwarding tunnels/LSPs,
   and inform the remote T-PE/S-PEs about the desired reverse tunnels/
   LSPs.

   Specifically, to set up a PW (or PW Segment), a PE may select a
   candidate tunnel/LSP to act as the PSN tunnel.  If no one available

Internet-Draft      Explicit PW to PSN Tunnel Binding          June 2011


   or satisfies the constraints, the PE may trigger to establish a new
   tunnel/LSP.  The selected tunnel/LSP information is carried in the
   PSN Tunnel Binding TLV and sent with the Label Mapping message to the
   target PE.

   Upon the reception of the Label Mapping message, the receiving PE
   will process the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, determine whether it can
   accept the suggested tunnel/LSP or find the reverse tunnel/LSP that
   meets the request, and respond with a Label Mapping message, which
   contains the corresponding PSN Tunnel Binding TLV.

   It is possible that two PEs may request PSN binding to the same PW or
   PW segment over different co-routed or bidirectional tunnels/LSPs at
   the same time.  There may cause collisions of tunnel/LSPs selection
   as both PEs assume the active role.

   The PEs can be generally categorized into two types:

   1.  Active PE: the PE which initiates the selection of the tunnel/
       LSPs and informs the remote PE;

   2.  Passive PE: the PE which obeys the active PE's suggestion.

   Segmented PW has defined the active/passive role election (Section
   7.2.1, [RFC6073]).  This document will not define any new procedures.

   In the remaining of this document, it will elaborate the operation in
   two situations:

   1.  SS-PW: In this scenario, both PEs of a PW assume active roles

   2.  MS-PW: One PE is active, while the other is passive.  The PWs are
       setup using FEC 129


4.  PSN Binding Operation for SS-PW

   As illustrated in Figure-5, both PEs (say, PE1 and PE2) of a PW may
   independently initiate the setup.  To perform PSN binding, the Label
   Mapping messages MUST carry a PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, and the PSN
   Tunnel sub-TLV MUST contains the desired tunnel/LSPs of the sender.

          Figure 5: PSN binding operation in SS-PW environment

   As outlined previously, there are two types of binding request:
   congruent and strict.

   In strict binding, a PE (e.g., PE1) will mandate the other PE (e.g.,
   PE2) to use a specified tunnel/LSP (e.g.  LSP1) as the PSN tunnel on
   the reverse direction.  In the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, the S-bit MUST
   be set, the C-bit MUST be reset, and the Source and Destination IDs/
   Numbers MUST be filled.

   On receive, if the S-bit is set, other than following the processing
   procedure defined in Section 5.3.3 of [RFC4447], the receiving PE
   (i.e.  PE2) needs to determine whether to accept the indicated
   tunnel/LSP in PSN Tunnel Sub-TLV.

   If the receiving PE (PE2) is also an active PE, and may have
   initiated the PSN binding requests to the other PE (PE1), it MUST
   compare its own Node ID against the received Source Node ID.  If it
   is numerically lower, the PE (PE2) will reply a Label Mapping message
   to complete the PW setup and confirm the binding request.  The PSN
   Tunnel Binding TLV in the message MUST contain the same Source and
   Destination IDs/Numbers as in the received binding request, in the
   appropriate order.

   On the other hand, if the receiving PE (PE2) has a Node ID that is
   numerically higher than the Source Node ID carried in the PSN Tunnel
   Binding TLV, it MUST reply a Label Release message with status code
   set to "Reject to use the suggested tunnel/LSPs" and the received PSN
   Tunnel Binding TLV.

   To support congruent binding, the receiving PE can select the
   appropriated PSN tunnel/LSP for the reverse direction of the PW, so
   long as the forwarding and reverse PSNs are congruent.

   Initially, a PE (PE1) sends a Label Mapping message to the remote PE
   (PE2) with the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, with C-bit set, S-bit reset,
   and the appropriate Source and Destination IDs/Numbers.  In case of
   unidirectional LSPs, the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV may only contain the
   Source IDs/Numbers, the Destination IDs/Numbers are set to zero and
   left for PE2 to fill when responding the Label Mapping message.

   On receive, since PE2 is also an active PE, it needs to compare its
   own Node ID against the received Source Node ID.  If it's numerically
   lower, PE2 needs to find/establish a tunnel/LSP that meets the
   congruent constraint, and then reply a Label Mapping message with a
   PSN Binding TLV that contains the Source and Destination IDs/Numbers
   in the appropriate order.

   On the other hand, if the receiving PE (PE2) has a Node ID that is
   numerically higher than the Source Node ID carried in the PSN Tunnel
   Binding TLV, it MUST reply a Label Release message with status code
   set to "Reject to use the suggested tunnel/LSPs" and the received PSN
   Tunnel Binding TLV.

   In both strict and congruent bindings, if T-bit is set, the LSP
   Number field MUST be set to zero.  Otherwise, the field MUST contain
   the actual LSP number for the associated PSN LSP.

   After a PW established, the operators may choose to switch the PW
   from the current tunnel/LSPs.  Or, the underlying PSN is broken due
   to network failure.  In this scenario, a new Label Mapping message
   MUST be sent to update the changes.  Noting that when T-bit is set,
   the working LSP broken will not trigger to update the changes if
   there are protection LSPs.

   The message may carry a new PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, which contains
   the new Source and Destination Numbers/IDs.  The handling of the new
   message should be identical to what has been described in this
   section.

   However, if the new Label Binding message does not contain the PSN
   Tunnel Binding TLV, it declares the removal of any congruent
   constraints.  The PEs may not map the PW to the underlying PSN on
   purpose, the current independent PW to PSN binding will be used.

   Further, as an implementation option, the PEs should not remove the
   traffic from an operational PW, until the completion of the
   underlying PSN tunnel/LSP changes.

   MS-PW uses FEC 129 for PW setup.  We refer the operation to Figure-6.

         Figure 6: PSN binding operation in MS-PW environment

   When the active PE (T-PE1) starts to signal for a MS-PW, a PSN Tunnel
   Binding TLV MUST be carried in the Label Mapping message and sent to
   the adjacent S-PE (say S-PE1).  The PSN Tunnel Binding TLV includes
   the PSN Tunnel sub-TLV that carries the desired tunnel/LSP of
   T-PE1's.

   For strict binding, the initiating PE (T-PE1) MUST set the S-bit,
   reset the C-bit and indicates the binding tunnel/LSP to the next-hop
   S-PE (S-PE1).

   When S-PE1 receives the Label Mapping message, S-PE1 needs to
   determine if the signaling is for forward or reverse direction, as
   defined in Section 6.2.3 of [I-D.ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw].

   If the Label Mapping message is for forward direction, and S-PE1
   accepts the requested tunnel/LSPs from T-PE1, S-PE1 must save the
   tunnel/LSP information for reverse-direction processing later on.  If
   the PSN binding request is not acceptable, S-PE1 MUST reply a Label
   Release Message to the upstream PE (T-PE1) with Status Code set to
   "Reject to use the suggested tunnel/LSPs".

   Otherwise, S-PE1 relays the Label Mapping message to the next S-PE
   (S-PE2), with the PSN Tunnel sub-TLV carrying the information of the
   new PSN tunnel/LSPs selected by S-PE1 for the next PW segment.  S-PE2
   and subsequent S-PEs will repeat the same operation until the Label
   Mapping message reaches to the remote T-PE (T-PE2).

   If T-PE2 agrees with the requested tunnel/LSPs, it will reply a Label
   Mapping message to initiate to the binding process on the reverse
   direction.  The Label Mapping message contains the received PSN
   Tunnel Binding TLV for confirmation purposes.

   When its upstream S-PE (S-PE2) receives the Label Mapping message,
   the S-PE relays the Label Mapping message to its upstream adjacent
   S-PE (S-PE1), with the previously saved PSN tunnel/LSP information in
   the PSN Tunnel sub-TLV.  The same procedure will be applied on
   subsequent S-PEs, until the message reaches to T-PE1 to complete the
   PSN binding setup.

Internet-Draft      Explicit PW to PSN Tunnel Binding          June 2011


   During the binding process, if any PE does not agree to the requested
   tunnel/LSPs, it can send a Label Release Message to its upstream
   adjacent PE with Status Code set to "Reject to use the suggested
   tunnel/LSPs".

   For congruent binding, the initiating PE (T-PE1) MUST set the C-bit,
   reset the S-bit and indicates the suggested tunnel/LSP in PSN Tunnel
   sub-TLV to the next-hop S-PE (S-PE1).

   During the MS-PW setup, the PEs have the option to ignore the
   suggested tunnel/LSP, and select another tunnel/LSP for the segment
   PW between itself and its upstream PE on reverse direction only if
   the tunnel/LSP is congruent with the forwarding one.  Otherwise, the
   procedure is the same as the strict binding.

   The tunnel/LSPs may change after a MS-PW being established.  When a
   tunnel/LSP has changed, the PE that detects the change SHOULD select
   an alternative tunnel/LSP for temporary use while negotiating with
   other PEs following the procedure described in this section.


6.  Security Considerations

   The ability to control which LSP to carry traffic from a PW can be a
   potential security risk both for denial of service and traffic
   interception.  It is RECOMMENDED that PEs do not accept the use of
   LSPs identified in the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV unless the LSP end
   points match the PW or PW segment end points.  Furthermore, where
   security of the network is believed to be at risk, it is RECOMMENDED
   that PEs implement the LDP security mechanisms described in [RFC5036]
   and [RFC5920].


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  LDP TLV Types

   This document defines new TLV [Section 2.1 of this document] for
   inclusion in LDP Label Mapping message.  IANA is required to assign
   TLV type value to the new defined TLVs from LDP "TLV Type Name Space"
   registry.

7.1.1.  PSN Tunnel Sub-TLVs

   This document defines two sub-TLVs [Section 2.1.1 of this document]
   for PSN Tunnel Binding TLV.  IANA is required to create a new
   registry ("PSN Tunnel Sub-TLV Name Space") for PSN Tunnel sub-TLVs
   and to assign Sub-TLV type values to the following sub-TLVs.
