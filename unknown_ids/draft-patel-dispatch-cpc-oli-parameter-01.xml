    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines two new URI parameters to describe the calling
      party's category and toll class of service originating line information
      which are parameters also used in SS7 ISUP and other telephony
      signalling protocols. The intended use of these URI parameters is for
      the tel URI and SIP URI address schemes.</t>

    <!-- Introduction -->

    <section anchor="sec-intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>SS7 ISUP<xref target="ITU-ISUP" /> defines a Calling Party's Category
      (CPC) parameter that characterizes the station used to originate a call
      and carries other important state that can describe the originating
      party. One example of such information is the call may originate from a
      payphone; such information can be used by the network to handle the call
      in a specific way. When telephone numbers are contained in URIs, such as
      the tel URI <xref target="RFC3966" /> or equivalent SIP URI, it may be
      desirable to communicate any CPC associated with that telephone number
      or, in the context of a call, the party calling from it. This document
      proposes a method of carrying CPC data in SIP messages.</t>

      <t>In some networks (including North America), the Originating Line
      Information (OLI) parameter defined in ANSI ISUP <xref
      target="ANSI-ISUP"> </xref> is used to carry information related to the
      calling party and the class of service for a call. Legacy multifrequency
      (MF) signalling networks carry this information in the ANI II Digits
      <eref
      target="http://www.nanpa.com/number_resource_info/ani_ii_assignments.html" />.
      The call can originate from a multitude of devices or stations. For
      example, a coin operated phone or a phone located inside a prison can be
      used to originate a call. In such cases, it can be desirable to handle
      calls originating from such stations in a specific manner, or to
      restrict certain services to the calling party. This document proposes a
      method of carrying OLI data in SIP messages.<t>Other use cases may exist
      where is it useful to transfer information about the endpoint even when
      interworking with the PSTN does not occur. In such cases, the calling
      party's catagory or originating line identity can be added when the
      calling party is identified by either a tel URI or a SIP URI.</t></t>

    <!--Parameter Definition-->

    <section anchor="sec-def" title="Parameter Definitions">
      <t>The Calling Party's Category (CPC) and the Originating Line
      Information (OLI) are represented as URI parameters for the tel URI
      scheme and the SIP URI representation of telephone numbers. The ABNF
      <xref target="RFC5234" /> syntax is as follows. The 'par' production is
      defined in RFC 3966 <xref target="RFC3966" />. The "/=" syntax indicates
      an extension of the production on the left-hand side:<list
          style="hanging">
          <t>par /= cpc / oli</t>

          <t>cpc = cpc-tag "=" cpc-value</t>

          <t>oli = oli-tag "=" oli-value</t>

          <t>cpc-tag = "cpc"</t>

          <t>oli-tag = "isup-oli"</t>

          <t>cpc-value = 8*8BIT / "ordinary" / "test" / "operator" /
          "payphone" / "unknown" / genvalue</t>

          <t>oli-value = 8*8BIT / "hotel" / "prison" / "cellular" /
          "cellular-roaming" / genvalue</t>

          <t>genvalue = 1*(alphanum / "-" / "." )</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The semantics of these CPC and OLI values are described below:<list
          style="hanging">
          <t>ordinary: The caller has been identified, and has no special
          features.</t>

          <t>test: This is a test call that has been originated as part of a
          maintenance procedure.</t>

          <t>operator: The call was generated by an operator position.</t>

          <t>payphone: The calling station is a payphone.</t>

          <t>unknown: The CPC could not be ascertained.</t>

          <t>hotel: The calling station is in a hotel or motel.</t>

          <t>prison: The calling station is in a prison.</t>

          <t>cellular: The calling station is a radio-telephone operating in
          its home network.</t>

          <t>cellular-roaming: The calling station is a radio-telephone
          roaming in another network.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The 8 bit values are assigned by ITU-T/ANSI <xref
      target="ITU-ISUP" /><xref target="ANSI-ISUP" /> and for the OLI, are
      binary equivalaents of the decimal codes used in the II digits of the
      ANI sequence for in-band signalling system <eref
      target="http://www.nanpa.com/number_resource_info/ani_ii_assignments.html" />.</t>

      <t>The "cpc" and "isup-oli" URI parameters are optional parameters. At
      the most, one "cpc" and/or one "isup-oli" parameter may be included in a
      URI of the calling party. In SIP the calling party is generally
      identified by the identity given in the From header field, or
      alternatively, in the P-Asserted-Identity header field if this is used.
      Usage is discussed in the following sections of this document.</t>

      <t>An example of the syntax of the "cpc" parameter is given
      below:<t>From:
      &lt;tel:+17005554141;cpc=payphone&gt;;tag=1928301774</t></t>

      <t>Alternatively, the tel URI may be included in the P-Asserted-Identity
      header field <xref target="RFC3325" />:<t>P-Asserted-Identity: &lt;tel:
      +17005554141;cpc=payphone&gt;</t></t>

      <t>The "isup-oli" URI parameter usage is given in the following example,
      which uses the SIP URI representation of telephone numbers: <t>From:
      &lt;sip:
      +1700554141@example.com;isup-oli=00011101&gt;;tag=1928301774</t><t>The
      "isup-oli" parameter with value 00011101 indicates that the device that
      the call is initiated from is located within a prison. An "isup-oli"
      with value "prison" is equally valid.</t></t>

      <t>For the case where a call is originared by a SIP UA where the caller
      is identified by a SIP URI that does not contain a telephone number,
      "isup-oli" URI parameter usage is given in the following example, which
      uses the SIP URI representation of telephone numbers:
      <t>P-Asserted-Identity: &lt;sip:
      alice@example.com;isup-oli=cellular&gt;</t><t>The "isup-oli" parameter
      with value "cellular" indicates that the device that the call is
      initiated from is a mobile device operating in its home cellular
      network.</t></t>
    </section>

    <!-- Usage-->

    <section anchor="sec-usage" title="Usage">
      <t>The CPC and OLI are generally useful only when describing the
      originator of a telephone call or the station from where a telephone
      call is originated. Therefore, when this parameter is used in an
      application such as SIP, it is recommended that the parameter be applied
      to URIs that characterize the originator of a call (such as a SIP URI or
      tel URI in the P-Asserted-Identity header field or the From header field
      of a SIP message). Note that many Calling Party's Category values from
      the PSTN are intentionally excluded from the "cpc" parameter as they are
      either meaningless outside of the PSTN or can be represented using
      another existing concept. For example, the language of an operator can
      be expressed more richly using the Accept-Language header in SIP than in
      the "cpc" parameter. Similarly the priority of a call is a
      characteristic of the call and not the calling party.</t>

      <t>It is anticipated that "cpc" and "isup-oli" URI parameters will be
      used primarily by gateways that interwork ISUP or ANI II networks with
      SIP networks. However, scenarios where interworking with the PSTN does
      not occur are not precluded. Various SIP network intermediaries might
      consult the CPC or OLI information as they make routing decisions,
      although no specific behavior is prescribed in this document. While no
      specific mapping of the various ISUP parameters that contain CPC or OLI
      data is offered in this document, creating such a mapping would be
      trivial.</t>

      <t>While the CPC and OLI could be conveyed using the ISUP tunneling
      mechanism described in RFC 3372 <xref target="RFC3372" />, this
      technique is widely regarded by the implementation community as overkill
      for the problem of conveying CPC and OLI information. For example, the
      "cpc" and "isup-oli" parameters provides a convenient way for SIP
      intermediaries to make routing decisions based on the CPC and OLI
      information without having to implement an ISUP parser. The "cpc" and
      "isup-oli" URI parameters provide a simple, convenient form of CPC and
      OLI interoperability of SIP with ISUP and ANI II, which is otherwise
      poorly addressed in RFC 3372<xref target="RFC3372" />. Indeed when a SIP
      intermediary makes routing decisions for a call where both the
      originating and the terminating gateways natively use ANI II, the ISUP
      tunneling approach is especially unattractive, requiring each of the
      three devices to perform a translation into an otherwise unneeded PSTN
      protocol.</t>

      <t>If the "cpc" URI parameter is not present, consumers of the CPC
      information should treat the URI as if it specified a CPC of "ordinary".
      If the "isup-oli" URI parameter is not present, consumers of the OLI
      information should treat the URI as if no OLI information is provided.
      If a SIP intermediary does not support the "cpc" or "isup-oli" URI
      parameters and receives a SIP message where the calling party URI in the
      From or P-Asserted-header fields includes a "cpc" or "isup-oli" URI
      parameter, then the SIP intermediary silently ignores the URI parameter
      in accordance with RFC 3261<xref target="RFC3261" />.</t>

      <t>At most, one instance of the "cpc" parameter and/or one instance of
      the "isup-oli" parameter can be associated with a particular URI within
      a SIP request. It is recommended that the "cpc" and "oli" URI parameters
      are associated with URIs included in the P-Asserted-Identity header
      field. Where the P-Asserted-Identity header field is not supported or
      included, another header field used to carry a URI to characterize the
      originator of a call may be used. One example of such a header field is
      the From header field. The following section discusses further the
      motivation behind this recommendation. </t>
    </section>

    <!-- Security Considerations -->

    <section anchor="sec-security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>There are three potential risks specific to the information provided
      by the Calling Party's Category or Originating Line Identity:<t>-
      leakage of potentially private information; </t><t>- the threat of
      tampering with the CPC or OLI to add false CPC or OLI values; and
      </t><t>- the threat of tampering with the CPC or OLI to remove actual
      CPC or OLI values.</t></t>

      <t>The information contained in the "cpc" or "isup-oli" parameter may be
      of a private nature, and it may not be appropriate for this value to be
      revealed to the destination user (typically it would not be so revealed
      in the PSTN). However, the calling party's category is often
      discoverable or easily guessable from the calling party's phone number.
      For that reason it is unlikely that this information is significantly
      more privacy sensitive than the telephone number itself. The same
      techniques used to provide complete or partial telephone number privacy
      in SIP are appropriate to apply to the "cpc" and "isup-oli" parameters
      as well. For more information about privacy issues in SIP see RFC
      3323<xref target="RFC3323" />. The mechanism described in RFC 3325 <xref
      target="RFC3325" /> may also be relevant for maintaining partial privacy
      or the CPC or OLI within a trusted administrative domain or federation
      of domains as described in RFC 3324<xref target="RFC3324" />.</t>

      <t>Making a call with a falsified CPC or OLI (i.e. "operator") could
      allow the caller to gain access to resources or information not
      otherwise available. Likewise removing an "undesirable" CPC or OLI value
      (ex: prison or hotel) could allow the caller to bypass various
      restrictions in the telephone network. For that reason, agents which
      expect CPC or OLI values SHOULD take care to insure the integrity and
      authenticity of the "cpc" or "isup-oli" URI parameter. The RECOMMENDED
      mechanism to protect the entire calling party address along with the
      "cpc" or "isup-oli" URI parameter is the SIP Identity mechanism <xref
      target="RFC4474"> </xref> . Alternatively, agents within an
      administrative domain or federation of domains MAY use the mechanism
      described in RFC 3325<xref target="RFC3325" /> to place the "cpc" or
      "isup-oli" URI parameter in a P-Asserted-Identity header field. When
      such mechanism is used, the "cpc" or "isup-oli" URI parameter is added
      by a network entity or SIP intermediary if knowledge of the calling
      party's category or originating line identity (class of service) is
      known.</t>

      <t>When the end-device, acting as a UAC originating a call, is not
      trusted, the value of a "cpc" or "isup-oli" URI parameter included by
      the UAC may be removed or modified by a trusted network entity. If a
      request containing CPC or OLI is sent towards a non-trusted entity, this
      information should be removed. </t>

      <t>The SIP Identity mechanism provides a signature over the URI in the
      From header field of a SIP request. It can sign a SIP URI or a tel URI
      alone or a tel URI embedded in a SIP or SIPS URI, but it provides
      stronger protection against tampering when the tel URI is embedded in a
      SIP or SIPS URI. Because there is no direct correlation between a tel
      URI and an Internet domain, the receiver can use a list of domains from
      which it will trust CPC or OLI information, or a list of root
      certificates which are associated with trusting CPC or OLI
      information.</t>

      <t>Otherwise, this mechanism adds no new security considerations to
      those discussed in RFC 3261<xref target="RFC3261" />.</t>
