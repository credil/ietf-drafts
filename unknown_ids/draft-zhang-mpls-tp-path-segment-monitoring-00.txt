Internet-Draft           Path Segment Monitoring               July 2010


1.  Introduction

   In order to monitor, protect and manage a portion (i.e. segment
   orconcatenated segment) of a transport path, a path segment is
   defined between the edges of the portion of the LSP that needs to be
   monitored, protected or managed.  If this path segment is created as
   a hierarchical LSP, it is called SPME (Sub-Path Maintenance Element).

   There are different ways to realize path segment monitoring in
   MPLS-TP network.  Here we will discuss their advantages and
   disadvantages.

3.  Path Segment Monitoring Analysis

3.1.  MBB

   The make-before-break (MBB) procedures which are supported by MPLS
   allow the creation of a SPME on existing LSPs in-service without
   traffic disruption, as described in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-framework].  A
   SPME can be defined corresponding to one or more end-to-end LSPs.
   New end-to-end LSPs which are tunneled within the SPME can be set up,
   which may require coordination across administrative boundaries.
   Traffic of the existing LSPs is switched over to the new end-to-end
   tunneled LSPs.  The old end-to-end LSPs can then be torn down.  See
   the figure below:

     |LERx|--|LSRy|-+                                        +-|LSRz|--|LERt|
                    |                                        |

                    +--|     |---|    |---|    |----|     |--+
                       |LER1 |   |LSR3|   |LSR4|    |LER2 |

   However, LER1 needs to tell the old LSPs's ingress nodes (for
   expample, LERx and LERa) that a SPME has been setup to monitor the
   segment between LER1 and LER2.  The coordination procedure is not
   described clearly.  [RFC4736] gives the RSVP-TE extension to realize
   reoptimization of MPLS TE Loosely Routed LSP.  It is said that when a
   mid-point LSR whose next hop is a loose hop or an abstract node
   canlocally trigger a path re-evaluation when a configurable timer
   expires, some specific events occur (e.g., link-up event), or the
   user explicitly requests it.  If a preferable path is found, the LSR
   sends an RSVP PathErr to the head-end LSR (Error code 25 (Notify),
   Error sub-code=6 ("preferable path exists")).  When SPME is setup for
   path segment monitoring, it can be seen as a new link, "preferable
   path exists" is appliable also.  But in order to differentiate the
   cases between monitoring and reopitimization, a new vale "preferable
   SPME exists" can be assigned.

   MBB needs to tear down the old LSP and setup new LSP, which needs
   LSPs ingress and egress nodes to switch user traffic from old LSPto
   new LSP, furthermore it will change the address management of all
   MEPs and MIPs newly configured for new LSP.  In order to restrict
   that the operation happens just on SPME's ingress and egress nodes,
   we will give another solution described below.

3.2.  Local rerouting

   Assuming that bidirectional LSP1(LERx-LSRy-LER1-LSR3-LSR4-LER2-LSRz-
   LERt) needs to be tunneled into SPME1 (LER1-LSR1-LSR2- LER2), The
   corresponding label values (from LERx to LERt direction) are (Lyx-
   L1y-L31-L43-L24-Lz2-Ltz), which are carried in the Resv message of
   LSP1.  The corresponding label values (from LERt to LERx direction)
   are (Lxy-Ly1-L13-L34-L42-L2z-Lzt), which are carried in the Path
   message of LSP1.  LER1 uses the label L24 as the inner label and push
   it into SPME1, LER2 uses the label L13 as the inner label and push it
   into SPME1.  But LER1 (LER2) needs to learn L24 (L13), this can be
   done as follow:

   LER1 push LSP1's Path message into SPME1, the next hop is changed
   from LSR3 to LER2, Upsteam-Label unchanged (L13 is allocated to
   LER2).  Similarly, LER2 push LSP1's Resv message inot SPME1, the next
   hop is changed from LSR4 to LER1, and Label unchanged (L24 is
   allocated to LER1).  After LER1 (LER2) has learned the label value
   L24 (L13), it can push the user traffic into SPME1.

   The monitoring of unidirectional LSP is similar, the only difference
   is that the Resv message frome LER2 to LER1 needs to be transmitted
   hop by hop.

   Although this scheme is more optimized compared to MBB, it can not

   solve the inherited limitation like all label stack based methods.
   For example, a) increasing the bandwidth by stacking MPLS headers, b)
   changing the condition of original transport path by changing the
   length of the MPLS frame (Delay measurement and loss measurement can
   be sensitive).

3.3.  TTL TLV

   According the inherited disadvantages of label stack, here we give
   another solution for option.

                                 TTL=3


            Figure 2: TTL for transport path Segment monitoring

   TTL TLV, as one of the optional ACH TLV objects, is defined in
   [draft-boutros-mpls-lsp-ping-ttl-tlv-01].  Here we use this TLV to
   realize path segment monitoring.  See the figure above, the path
   segment (B-C-D) of LSP1 (A-B-C-D-E) needs to be monitored.  Node B,
   as the MEP node of path segment needs to be monitored.  Node B sends
   OAM message (like CC/CV, PM loss/dely, etc.) to node D, MUST insert
   the TTL TLV as one of the ACH TLV objects.  TTL value is set to the
   hop counts from B to D, here it is 3.  In this way, node D can
   differentiate the OAM message sent by different MEP nodes.

   The TTL value can be configured staticly or learn by traceroute
   procedure.

   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers] describes the MEP-ID of Pseudowire
   Segments, here we suggest to add the MEP configuration of LSP
   segments.  The MEP_ID can be formed by a combination of a LSP MEP_ID
   and the identification of the local node.
