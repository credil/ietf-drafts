    <section title="Overview">
     <t>The PANA Base Protocol <xref target="RFC5191"/> is structured for
     network access authentication where authenticating peers are typically
     in a many-to-one relationship; multiple end-users (PaC) and an 
     authentication server (PAA). Therefore the PANA protocols operating parameters
     naturally segments to parameters that are common to both PaC and PAA and
     parameters specific only to either PaC and PAA.</t>
     <t>The MIB objects described in this document follows the same pattern.
     As of this writing, there are not explicit dependecies between this document
     and other MIB modules.</t>

<!--
<t><cref>[TEMPLATE TODO] Each internet draft that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
those modules. This section MUST be patterned after the latest approved
template (available at the OPS Area web site).
</cref></t>

<t><cref>[TEMPLATE TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
include the following boilerplate paragraph, and list.the objects and their sensitivity.</cref></t>


      <t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
      with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such objects
      may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
      The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
      proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
      These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t></t>

<t><cref>[TEMPLATE TODO] writeable tables and managed objects that could be especially disruptive
if abused and the associated security risks should be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
example.</cref></t>
        </list></t>

<t><cref>[TEMPLATE TODO] else if there are no read-write or read-create objects in your MIB module,
use the following boilerplate paragraph.</cref></t>

      <t>There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
      a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. So, if this MIB
      module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder
      can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct
      SNMP SET operations.</t>

      <t><cref>For all MIB modules you must evaluate whether any readable objects
      are sensitive or vulnerable (for instance, if they might reveal customer
      information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
      European Union if exposed to unathorized parties). If so, please include the
following boilerplate paragraph.</cref></t>

      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
      MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
      even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
      encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
      via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability: <list style="symbols">
          <t></t>

<t><cref>[TEMPLATE TODO] you should explicitly list by name any readable objects that

information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
European Union if exposed to unathorized parties).</cref></t>

<t><cref>[TEMPLATE TODO] The following three boilerplate paragraphs
should not be changed without very good reason. Changes will almost
certainly require justification during IESG review.</cref></t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
      if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
      and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
      module.</t>

      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
      provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>,
      section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
      mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
      RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
      cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to
      ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
      module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
      those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
      SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">

  <!--

<t><cref>[TEMPLATE TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
Considerations section. The requirements for this section vary depending
what actions are required of the IANA. See "Guidelines for Writing an IANA 
Considerations Section in RFCs" [RFC2434]. and see RFC4181 section 3.5 for more
information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module internet draft.</cref></t>

        <artwork><![CDATA[
     The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
     OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
      
     Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
     ----------        -----------------------
     sampleMIB         { mib-2 XXX }

      </figure>

      <t></t>

      <t>Option #2:</t>

      <t>Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
      requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and to
      record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry. When the assignment
      has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX" (here and in the
      MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove this note.</t>

      <t>Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, an internet
      draft MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
      numbers. See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done in
      an internet draft MIB module.</t>

      <t>Option #3:</t>

      <t>This memo includes no request to IANA.</t>

    <!-- References Section -->

    <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
   references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
   normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
   The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

   The standard MIB boilerplate available at
  the OPS Area web site includes lists of
   normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
   specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
   modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
   then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
   in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
   IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
   SHALL reference the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
   policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
   text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
   documents containing imported definitions (other than those already
   mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
   Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD reference the most recent
version of the specification in question.
