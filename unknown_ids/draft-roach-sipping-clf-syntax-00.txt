Internet-Draft   Binary Syntax for SIP Common Log Format      March 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Common Log File (CLF) format for the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) [I-D.gurbani-sipping-clf] proposes a syntax for logging SIP
   messages received and sent by SIP clients, servers, and proxies.  The
   syntax proposed by that document has been inspired by the common HTTP
   log format.  However, experience with that format has shown that
   dealing with large quantities of log data can be very processor
   intensive, as doing so necessary requires reading and parsing every
   byte in the log file(s) of interest.

   This document counterpropses a format that is no more difficult to
   generate by logging entites, while being radically faster to process.
   In particular, the format is optimized for both rapidly scanning
   through log records, as well as quickly locating commonly-accessed
   data fields.  Both operations can be performed in constant time (as
   compared with O(n) time associated with the current format, where n
   is the length of the log record).


2.  Format

   Each data record is encoded according to the following format:

      0x80 -   Request/Response flag (0 = request, 1 = response)
      0x40 -   Retransmission flag (Always set to 0 if server is
         stateless)
      0x20 -   Sent/Recieved flag (0 = message received, 1 = message
         sent)
      0x10 -   Reserved
      0x08 -   Reserved
      0x04 -   Reserved
      0x02 -   Reserved
      0x01 -   Reserved

   Record Length (3 bytes):  Total length of this log record, including
      "Flags" and "Record Length" fields

   Date/Time (8 bytes):  Seconds since midnight, January 1st, 1970, GMT

   Time (4 bytes):  Nanoseconds since the time in Date/Time field (<=
      999,999,999)

   CSeq Number (4 bytes):  CSeq number from the SIP message

   Response Code (2 bytes):  Set to the value of the response code for
      responses.  Should be set to 0 for requests.

   TLV Start Ptr (2 bytes):  Indicates an absolute byte value for the
      start of tag/length/value (TLV) groups.  Set to 0 if no TLVs are
      present.

   Bytes 24 trough 55 contain pointer/length pairs that point to the
   values of variable-length mandatory fields.  The "Pointer" fields
   indicate absolute byte values within the record, and must be >= 56
   bytes.  They point to the start of the corresponding value within the
   "Mandatory Field Data" area.  The "Length" fields indicate the length
   of the corresponding value.

   Server Txn:  The transaction identifier associated with the server
      transaction.  Implementations MAY reuse the server transaction
      identifier (the topmost branch-id of the incoming request, with or
      without the magic cookie), or they MAY generate a unique
      identification string for a server transaction (this identifier
      needs to be locally unique to the server only.)  This identifier
      is used to correlate ACKs and CANCELs to an INVITE transaction; it
      is also used to aid in forking.

   Client Txn:  This field is used to associate client transactions with
      a server transaction for forking proxies or B2BUAs.

   Method:  In requests, the method from the start line.  In responses,
      the method found in the CSeq header field.

   To Value:  Value of the To header field, possibly with the tag
      parameter removed.  (Whether to remove the tag paramter is left up
      to the logging entity).

   To Tag:  Value of the To header field tag parameter.  If no To header
      field tag parameter is present, the pointer field is ignored, and
      the length field is set to 0.

   From Value:  Value of the From header field, possibly with the tag
      parameter removed.  (Whether to remove the tag paramter is left up
      to the logging entity)

   From Tag:  Value of the From header field tag parameter.

   Call-Id:  The value of the Call-ID header field

   Mandatory Field Data:  Contains actual values for the preceding
      fields.  Note that this data is not necessarily in order, and is
      not necessarily non-overlapping.  In particular, loggers may
      usefully choose to overlap the "To Tag" field with the "To Value"
      field (and the "From Tag" field with the "From Value" field).

   The Tag/Length/Value groups appear zero or more times, at the
   location indicated by the "TLV Start Ptr" field.  They are used to
   log information that is not mandatory for all messages (although
   specific TLVs are mandatory in request logs).

   Tag Field (2 bytes):  indicates the type of value coded by this TLV.
      Currently defined tags are:

      0 -  Contact value (can be repeated)
         Contains entire value of Contact header field

      1 -  Request URI (mandatory in request)
         Contains Request URI in start line

      2 -  Remote Host (mandatory in request)
         The DNS name of IP address from which the message was received
         (if "sent/received flag" is 0) of the IP address to which the
         message is being send (if "sent/received flag" is 1)

      3 -  Authenticated User
         Contans the user name by which the user has been authenticated

      4 -  Complete SIP Message (optional, should be omitted by default)
         Contains complete SIP message.  Can be repeated multiple times
         to accomodate SIP messages that exceed 65535 bytes in length.


   Length Field (2 bytes):  indicates the length of the value coded in
      this TLV.  This length does NOT include the TLV header.

   Value Field (0 to 65535 bytes):  contains the actual value of this
      TLV.
