     1. Introduction 

        The IPFIX architectural components in [RFC5470] consist of 
        IPFIX Devices and IPFIX Collectors communicating using the 
        IPFIX protocol [RFC5101], which specifies how to export IP 
        Flow information.  This protocol is designed to export 
        information about IP traffic Flows and related measurement 
        data, where a Flow is defined by a set of key attributes 
        (e.g. source and destination IP address, source and 
        destination port, etc.).  
         
        However, thanks to its Template mechanism, the IPFIX protocol 
        can export any type of information, as long as the relevant 
        Information Element is specified in the IPFIX Information 
        Model [RFC5102], registered with IANA, or specified as an 
        enterprise-specific Information Element.  The specifications 
        in the IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] have not been defined in the 
        context of an IPFIX Mediator receiving, aggregating, 
        correlating, anonymizing, etc... Flow Records from the one or 
        multiple Exporters.  Indeed, the IPFIX protocol must be 
        adapted for Intermediate Processes, as defined in the IPFIX 
        Mediation Reference Model as specified in the Figure A of 
        [IPFIX-MED-FMWK], which is based on the IPFIX Mediation 
        Problem Statement [RFC5982]. 
         
        This document specifies the IP Flow Information Export 
        (IPFIX) protocol in the context of the implementation and 
        deployment of IPFIX Mediators.  The use of the IPFIX 
        protocol within a Mediator -- a device which contains both 
        as an Exporting Process and a Collecting Process -- has an 
        impact on the technical details of the usage of the 
        protocol.  An overview of the technical problem is covered 
        in section 6 of the [RFC5982]: loss of original exporter 
        information, loss of base time information, transport 
        sessions management, loss of Options Template Information,

        Template Id management, considerations for network topology, 
        and IPFIX Mediation interpretation, and considerations for 
        aggregation. 
         
        The specifications in this document are based on the IPFIX 
        protocol specifications but adapted according to the IPFIX 
        Mediation Framework [IPFIX-MED-FMWK]. 
      
      
     1.1. IPFIX Documents Overview 

        The IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101] provides network administrators 
        with access to IP Flow information. 
         
        The architecture for the export of measured IP Flow 
        information out of an IPFIX Exporting Process to a Collecting 
        Process is defined in the IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470], per 
        the requirements defined in RFC 3917 [RFC3917]. 
         
        The IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470] specifies how IPFIX Data 
        Records and Templates are carried via a congestion-aware 
        transport protocol from IPFIX Exporting Processes to IPFIX 
        Collecting Processes. 
         
        IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX Information Elements, 
        their name, type and additional semantic information, as 
        specified in the IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102].   
         
        The IPFIX Applicability Statement [RFC5472] describes what 
        type of applications can use the IPFIX protocol and how they 
        can use the information provided.  It furthermore shows how 
        the IPFIX framework relates to other architectures and 
        frameworks.  
         
        "IPFIX Mediation: Problem Statement" [RFC5982], describing the 
        IPFIX Mediation applicability examples, along with some problems 
        that network administrators have been facing, is the basis for 
        the "IPFIX Mediation: Framework" [IPFIX-MED-FMWK].  This 
        framework details the IPFIX Mediation reference model and the 
        components of an IPFIX Mediator. 
              
      
     1.2. IPFIX Mediator Documents Overview 

        The "IPFIX Mediation: Problem Statement" [RFC5982] provides an 
        overview of the applicability of Mediators, and defines 
        requirements for Mediators in general terms.  This document is 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 25, 2010            [Page 4] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>   October 2010 
         

        of use largely to define the problems to be solved through the 
        deployment of IPFIX Mediators, and to provide scope to the role 
        of Mediators within an IPFIX collection infrastructure.   
         
        The "IPFIX Mediation: Framework" [IPFIX-MED-FMWK] provides more 
        architectural details of the arrangement of Intermediate 
        Processes within a Mediator. 
      
        The details of specific Intermediate Processes, when these have 
        additional export specifications (e.g., metadata about the 
        intermediate processing conveyed through IPFIX Options 
        Templates), are each treated in their own document (e.g., the 
        "IP Flow Anonymisation Support" [IPFIX-MED-ANON]).  Documents 
        specifying the operations of specific Intermediate Processes 
        cover the operation of these Processes within the Mediator 
        framework, and complying to the specifications given in this 
        document; they may additionally specify the operation of the 
        process independently, outside the context of a Mediator, when 
        this is appropriate.  As of today, these documents are:  
         
        1. "IP Flow Anonymisation Support", [IPFIX-MED-ANON], which 
        describes anonymisation techniques for IP flow data and the 
        export of anonymised data using the IPFIX protocol.  
         
        2. "Flow Selection Techniques" [IPFIX-MED-FLOWSEL], which 
        described the process of selecting a subset of flows from all 
        flows observed at an observation point, along with the 
        motivations, and some specific flow selection techniques. 
         
        3. "Exporting Aggregated Flow Data using the IP Flow Information 
        Export" [IPFIX-MED-AGGR] which describes Aggregated Flow export 
        within the framework of IPFIX Mediators and defines an 
        interoperable, implementation-independent method for Aggregated 
        Flow export. 
         
     1.3. Relationship with IPFIX and PSAMP 

        The specification in this document applies to the IPFIX 
        protocol specifications [RFC5101].  All specifications from 
        [RFC5101] apply unless specified otherwise in this document. 
      
        As the Packet Sampling (PSAMP) protocol specifications 
        [RFC5476] are based on the IPFIX protocol specifications, the 
        specifications in this document are also valid for the PSAMP 
        protocol.  Therefore, the method specified by this document 
        also applies to PSAMP.

     2. Terminology 

        The IPFIX-specific and PSAMP-specific terminology used in this 
        document is defined in [RFC5101] and [RFC5476], respectively.  
        The IPFIX Mediation terms related to the aggregation, such as 
        the Interval, Aggregated Flow, and Aggregated Fonction are 
        defined in [IPFIX-MED-AGGR]. 
         
        The IPFIX Mediation-specific terminology used in this document 
        is defined in "IPFIX Mediation: Problem Statement" [RFC5982], 
        and reuse in "IPFIX Mediation: Framework" [IPFIX-MED-FMWK].  
        However, since those two documents are an informational RFC, the 
        definitions have been reproduced here along with additional 
        definitions.   
         
        Similarly, since the [IPFIX-MED-ANON] is an experimental RFC, 
        the Anonymisation Record, Anonymised Data Record, and 
        Intermediate Anonymisation Process terms, specified in [IPFIX-
        MED-ANON], are also reproduced here. 
      
        In this document, as in [RFC5101], [RFC5476], [IPFIX-MED-AGGR , 
        and [IPFIX-MED-ANON], the first letter of each IPFIX-specific 
        and PSAMP-specific term is capitalized along with the IPFIX 
        Mediation-specific term defined here.  In this document, we call 
        "record stream" a stream of records carrying flow- or packet-
        based information.  The records may be encoded as IPFIX Data 
        Records in any other format. 
         
        Transport Session Information 
         
         The Transport Session is specified in [RFC5101].  In SCTP, the 
         Transport Session Information is the SCTP association.  In TCP 
         and UDP, the Transport Session Information corresponds to a 5-
         tuple {Exporter IP address, Collector IP address, Exporter 
         transport port, Collector transport port, transport protocol}. 
         
        Original Exporter 
         
          An Original Exporter is an IPFIX Device that hosts the  
          Observation Points where the metered IP packets are observed. 
           
        Original Observation Point 
         
         An Observation Point is a location in the network where IP 
         packets are observed, as received by the IPFIX Mediation.  
         Examples include: a (set of) specific exporter(s), a (set of) 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 25, 2010            [Page 6] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>   October 2010 
         

         specific interface(s) on an exporter, a (set of) line card(s) 
         on an exporter, or any combinations of these.   
         
        IPFIX Mediation 
         
          IPFIX Mediation is the manipulation and conversion of a record 
          stream for subsequent export using the IPFIX protocol. 
         
        The following terms are used in this document to describe the 
        architectural entities used by IPFIX Mediation. 
         
        Intermediate Process 
         
          An Intermediate Process takes a record stream as its input 
          from Collecting Processes, Metering Processes, IPFIX File 
          Readers, other Intermediate Processes, or other record 
          sources; performs some transformations on this stream, based 
          upon the content of each record, states maintained across 
          multiple records, or other data sources; and passes the 
          transformed record stream as its output to Exporting 
          Processes, IPFIX File Writers, or other Intermediate 
          Processes, in order to perform IPFIX Mediation. Typically, an 
          Intermediate Process is hosted by an IPFIX Mediator. 
          Alternatively, an Intermediate Process may be hosted by an 
          Original Exporter. 
         
        Specific Intermediate Processes are described below.  However, 
        this is not an exhaustive list. 
         
        Intermediate Conversion Process 
         
          An Intermediate Conversion Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that transforms non-IPFIX into IPFIX, or manages the relation 
          among Templates and states of incoming/outgoing transport 
          sessions in the case of transport protocol conversion (e.g., 
          from UDP to SCTP). 
         
        Intermediate Aggregation Process 
         
          An Intermediate Aggregation Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that aggregates records based upon a set of Flow Keys or 
          functions applied to fields from the record (e.g., binning and 
          subnet aggregation). 
         
        Intermediate Correlation Process 
         

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 25, 2010            [Page 7] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>   October 2010 
         

          An Intermediate Correlation Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that adds information to records, noting correlations among 
          them, or generates new records with correlated data from 
          multiple records (e.g., the production of bidirectional flow 
          records from unidirectional flow records). 
         
        Intermediate Selection Process 
         
          An Intermediate Selection Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that selects records from a sequence based upon criteria-
          evaluated record values and passes only those records that 
          match the criteria (e.g., filtering only records from a given 
          network to a given Collector). 
         
        Intermediate Anonymization Process 
         
          An Intermediate Anonymization Process is an Intermediate 
          Process that transforms records in order to anonymize them, to 
          protect the identity of the entities described by the records 
          (e.g., by applying prefix-preserving pseudonymization of IP 
          addresses). 
         
        IPFIX Mediator 
         
          An IPFIX Mediator is an IPFIX Device that provides IPFIX 
          Mediation by receiving a record stream from some data sources, 
          hosting one or more Intermediate Processes to transform that 
          stream, and exporting the transformed record stream into IPFIX 
          Messages via an Exporting Process.  In the common case, an 
          IPFIX Mediator receives a record stream from a Collecting 
          Process, but it could also receive a record stream from data 
          sources not encoded using IPFIX, e.g., in the case of 
          conversion from the NetFlow V9 protocol [RFC3954] to IPFIX 
          protocol. 
           
        Anonymisation Record    
         
         A record, defined by the Anonymisation Options Template in

     3. Specifications 

        This section describes the IPFIX specifications for Mediation:   
        more specifically,  specifications for generic Intermediate 
        Processes.  Possible specific Intermediate Processes are: 
        Intermediate Conversion Process, Intermediate Aggregation 
        Process, Intermediate Correlation Process, Intermediate 
        Selection Process, Intermediate Anonymization Process.  
         
        For a specific Intermediate Process, the specifications in the 
        following reference MUST be followed, on the top of the 
        specifications in this document: 
       - For the Intermediate Aggregation Process, the specifications 
          in [IPFIX-MED-AGGR] MUST be followed. 
       - For the Intermediate Selection Process, the specifications in 
          [IPFIX-MED-FLOWSEL] MUST be followed.  
          EDITOR'S NOTE: actually, there is no MUST/SHOULD/MAY in 
          [IPFIX-MED-FLOWSEL], which seems to be a list of required 
          Information Elements. 
       - For the Intermediate Anonymization Process, the specifications 
          in [IPFIX-MED-ANON] should be considered as guidelines as 
          [IPFIX-MED-ANON] is an experimental RFC. 
       Note that no specific document deals with the Intermediate 
       Conversion Process at the time of this publication. 
        
        These new specifications, which are more specific compared to 
        [RFC5101], are described with the key words described in 
        [RFC2119].  
         
     3.1. Encoding of IPFIX Message Header 

        The format of the IPFIX Message Header is shown in Figure A. 
        Note that the format is similar to the IPFIX Message in 
        [RFC5101], but some field definitions (for the example, the 
        Export Time) have been updated in the context of the IPFIX 
        Mediator.

        Message Header Field Descriptions  
         
        Version 

                Version of Flow Record format exported in this message.  
                The value of this field is 0x000a for the current 
                version, incrementing by one the version used in the

        Length 

                Total length of the IPFIX Message, measured in octets, 
                including Message Header and Set(s). 

        Export Time 

                Time in seconds since 0000 UTC Jan 1st 1970, at which 
                the IPFIX Message Header leaves the IPFIX Mediator.   

        Sequence Number 

                Incremental sequence counter modulo 2^32 of all IPFIX 
                Data Records sent on this PR-SCTP stream from the 
                current Observation Domain by the Exporting Process.  
                Check the specific meaning of this field in the sub-
                sections of section 10 when UDP or TCP is selected as 
                the transport protocol.  This value SHOULD be used by 
                the Collecting Process to identify whether any IPFIX 
                Data Records have been missed.  Template and Options 
                Template Records do not increase the Sequence Number.

        Observation Domain ID 

                A 32-bit identifier of the Observation Domain that is 
                locally unique to the Exporting Process.  The Exporting 
                Process uses the Observation Domain ID to uniquely 
                identify to the Collecting Process the Observation 
                Domain that metered the Flows.  It is RECOMMENDED that 
                this identifier is also unique per IPFIX 
                Device.  Collecting Processes SHOULD use the Transport 
                Session and the Observation Domain ID field to separate 
                different export streams originating from the same 
                Exporting Process.  The Observation Domain ID SHOULD be 
                0 when no specific Observation Domain ID is relevant for 
                the entire IPFIX Message.  For example, when exporting 
                the Exporting Process Statistics, or in case of 
                hierarchy of Collector when aggregated data records are 
                exported.   
                Note: the Observation Domain Management is discussed in 
                section 3.4.1.   
      

     3.2. Template Management 

     3.2.1. Template Management Without Template Record Change 

        The first case is a situation where the IPFIX Mediator, 
        typically an IPFIX Distributor, relays an (Options) Template 
        without changing its content.  
         
        As in [RFC5101], the Template IDs are unique per Exporter, per 
        Transport Session, and per Observation Domain.  As there is no 
        guarantee that, for similar Template Records, the Template IDs 
        received on the incoming Transport Session and exported to the 
        outgoing Transport Session would be same, the IPFIX Mediator 
        MUST maintain a mapping database between received and exported 
        (Options) Template Records: 
       - for each Received (Options) Template Record: Template Record 
          Flow Keys and non Flow Keys, Template ID, Original Exporter, 
          Observation Domain, and Transport Session 
       - for each Exported (Options) Template Record: Template Record 
          Flow Keys and non Flow Keys, Template ID, Collector, 
          Observation Domain, and Transport Session 
         
        If an IPFIX Mediator receives an IPFIX Withdrawal Message for a 
        (Options) Template Record that is not used anymore in any 
        outgoing Transport Sessions, the IPFIX Mediator SHOULD export 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 25, 2010           [Page 11] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>   October 2010 
         

        the appropriate IPFIX Withdrawal Message(s) on the outgoing 
        Transport Session, and remove the corresponding entry in its 
        mapping database. 
         
        If a (Options) Template Record is not used anymore in outgoing 
        Transport Session, it MUST be withdrawn with an IPFIX Template 
        Withdrawal Message on that specific outgoing Transport Session, 
        and remove the corresponding entry in its mapping database. 
         
        If an incoming Transport Session is gracefully shutdown or 
        reset, the (Options) Template Records corresponding to that 
        Transport Session MUST be removed from the mapping database.  
         
      
     3.2.2. Template Management With Template Record Change 

        The second case is a situation where the IPFIX Mediator, 
        typically containing an Intermediate Conversion Process, 
        Intermediate Aggregation Process [IPFIX-MED-AGGR], or 
        Intermediate Anonymization Process in case of black-marker 
        anonymisation [IPFIX-MED-ANON], generates new (Options) Template 
        Records based what it receives from the Original Exporter(s), 
        and based on the Intermediate Process function. 
         
        In such a situation, the IPFIX Mediator doesn't maintain a 
        mapping database between received and exported (Options) 
        Template Records, as it generates its own series of (Options) 
        Template Records. 
      
      
     3.3. Time Management 

        The IPFIX Message Header "Export Time" field is the time in 
        seconds since 0000 UTC Jan 1, 1970, at which the IPFIX Message 
        Header leaves the IPFIX Mediator.  However, in the specific case 
        of an IPFIX Mediator containing an Intermediate Conversion 
        Process, the IPFIX Mediator MAY keep the export time received 
        from the incoming Transport Session. 
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that Mediators handle time using absolute 
        timestamps (e.g. flowStartSeconds, flowStartMilliseconds, 
        flowStartNanoseconds), which are specified relative to the UNIX 
        epoch (00:00 UTC 1 Jan 1970), where possible, rather than 
        relative timestamps (e.g. flowStartSysUpTime, 
        flowStartDeltaMicroseconds), which are specified relative to 
        protocol structures such as system initialization or message 
        export time.   
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 25, 2010           [Page 12] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>   October 2010 
         

         
        The latter are difficult to manage for two reasons.  First, they 
        require constant translation, as the system initialization time 
        of an intermediate system and the export time of an intermediate 
        message will change across mediation operations.  Further, 
        relative timestamps introduce range problems.  For example, when 
        using the flowStartDeltaMicroseconds and 
        flowEndDeltaMicroseconds Information Elements [RFC5102], the 
        Data Record must be exported within a maximum of 71 minutes 
        after its creation.  Otherwise, the 32-bit counter would not be 
        sufficient to contain the flow start time offset.  Those time 
        constraints might be incompatible with some of the Intermediate 
        Processes: Intermediate Aggregation Process (temporal) and 
        Intermediate Correlation Process, for example. 
         
        When an Intermediate Aggregation Process aggregates information 
        from different Flow Records, the typical reporting times SHOULD 
        BE the minimum of the start times and the maximum of the end 
        times.  However, if the Flow Records do not overlap, i.e. if 
        there is a time gap between the times in the Flow Records, then 
        the report may be inaccurate.  The IPFIX Mediator is only 
        reporting what it knows, on the basis of the information made 
        available to it - and there may not have been any data to 
        observe during the gap.  Then again, if there is an overlap in 
        timestamps, there's the potential of double-accounting: 
        different Observation Points may have observed the same traffic 
        simultaneously.  Therefore, as there is not a single rule that 
        fits all different situations, the precise rules of applying the 
        Flow Record timestamps in IPFIX Mediators is out of the scope of 
        this document.  However, some more specifications related to the 
        specific case of aggregation in space and time are specified in 
        [IPFIX-MED-AGGR], and MUST be followed. 
         
         
     3.4. Observation Point Management 

        Depending on the use case, top Collectors may need to receive 
        the Original Observation Point(s), otherwise it may wrongly 
        conclude that the IPFIX Device exporting the Flow Records to 
        him, i.e. the IPFIX Mediator, directly observed the packets that 
        generated the Flow Records.  Two new Information Element are 
        introduced to solve this use case: originalExporterIPv4Address 
        and originalExporterIPv6Address. 
         
        In the IPFIX Mediator, the Observation Point(s) may be 
        represented by:  

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 25, 2010           [Page 13] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>   October 2010 
         

       - A single Original Exporter (represented by the 
          originalExporterIPv4Address or originalExporterIPv6Address 
          Information Elements) 
       - A list of Original Exporter (represented by the 
          originalExporterIPv4Address or originalExporterIPv6Address 
          Information Elements_) 
       - A list of Original Exporter (represented by the 
          originalExporterIPv4Address or originalExporterIPv6Address 
          Information Elements), along with the associated interface 
          (represented by the ingressInterface and/or egressInterface)  
       - A list of Original Exporter (represented by the 
          originalExporterIPv4Address or originalExporterIPv6Address 
          Information Elements), along with the associated line card id 
          (represented by the lineCardId)  
       - Any combination or list of Information Elements representing 
          Observation Points.  
        
        Some Information Elements characterizing the Observation Point 
        may be added.  For example, the flowDirection Information 
        Element specifies the direction of the observation, and, as 
        such, characterizes the Observation Point. 
      
        Any combination of the above examples is possible.  For example, 
        a Original Observation Point composed of: 
              exporterIPv4Address 192.0.2.1  
              exporterIPv4Address 192.0.2.2,  
                       interface ethernet 0, direction ingress 
                       interface ethernet 1, direction ingress 
                       interface serial 1, direction egress 
                       interface serial 2, direction egress 
              exporterIPv4Address 192.0.2.3,  
                       lineCardId 1, direction ingress 
      
        If the Original Observation Point composed of a list exported 
        from the IPFIX Mediator, then the IPFIX Structured Data [IPFIX-
        STRUCT] MUST be used to encode it.   
         
        The most generic way to export the Original Observation Point is 
        to use a subTemplateMultiList, with the semantic "exactlyOneOf".  
        Taking back the previous example, the following encoding can be 
        used: 
         
                 Template Record 1: exporterIPv4Address 
                 Template Record 2: exporterIPv4Address, basicList of 
                                    ingressInterface, flowDirecdtion

     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>   October 2010 
         

                 Template Record 3: exporterIPv4Address, lineCardId,  
                                    flowDirection 
         
        The Original Observation Point is modeled with the Data Records 
        corresponding to either Template Record 1, Template Record 2, or 
        Template Record 3 but not more than one of these ("exactlyOneOf" 
        semantic).  This implies that the Flow was observed at exactly 
        one of the Observation Points reported. 
         
        When an IPFIX Mediator exports the Original Observation Domain, 
        it SHOULD export other information indicating that an IPFIX 
        Mediator certificates the original exporter IP address.  
        ExporterCertificate in [RFC5655] can be used in that case.  And 
        also, another Information Element indicating that certifies that 
        an IPFIX Mediator is required, just like mediatorCertificate. 
         

     3.4.1. Observation Domain Management 

        In terms of Observation Domain management, there are two types 
        of Intermediate Process function.  The first one maintains the 
        Observation Domain information, while the second one cannot 
        maintain it.  Examples of the second type include mixing Data 
        Records from multiple IPFIX Messages received from multiple 
        Observation Domains, or generating new Data Records from the 
        result of some intermediate function on Data Records from 
        multiple IPFIX Messages received from multiple Observation 
        Domains.   
         
        From the two types of Intermediate Process function discussed in 
        this section, a single specification can be deduced, as already 
        specified in 3.1. : The Observation Domain ID SHOULD be 0 when 
        no specific Observation Domain ID is relevant for the entire 
        IPFIX Message.  
      
         

     3.5. Specific Reporting Requirements 

        Some specific Options Templates and Options Template Records are 
        necessary to provide extra information about the Flow Records 
        and about the Metering Process. 
         
        The Options Template Records defined in these subsections, which 
        impose some constraints on the Metering Process and Exporting 
        Process implementations in Intermediate Processes, MAY be 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 25, 2010           [Page 15] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>   October 2010 
         

        implemented.  If implemented, the specific Option Templates 
        SHOULD be implemented as specified in these subsections. 
         
        The minimum set of Information Elements is always specified in 
        these Specific IPFIX Options Templates.  Nevertheless, extra 
        Information Elements may be used in these specific Options 
        Templates. 
         

     3.5.1. The Flow Keys Options Template 

        Exactly like the IPFIX protocol [RFC5101], the Flow Keys Option 
        Template specifies the structure of a Data Record for reporting 
        the Flow Keys of reported Flows.  A Flow Keys Data Record 
        extends a particular Template Record that is referenced by its 
        templateId identifier.  The Template Record is extended by 
        specifying which of the Information Elements contained in the 
        corresponding Data Records describe Flow properties that serve 
        as Flow Keys of the reported Flow. 
         
        The Flow Keys Option Template SHOULD contain the following 
        Information Elements that are defined in [RFC5102] 
           templateId              An identifier of a Template.  This 
                                   Information Element MUST be defined

        When any Intermediate Process changes the Flow Keys, the Flow 
        Keys Option Template MUST include the new set of Flow Keys. 
        Typically, an Intermediate Aggregation Process keeps or reduces 
        the number of Flow Keys

        The "Metering Process Statistics Options Template", "The 
        Metering Process Reliability Statistics Options Template", and 
        "The Exporting Process Reliability Statistics Options Template", 
        as specified in [RFC5101], SHOULD be implemented on the IFPIX 
        Mediator. 
         
        Refer to the document specifying a particular Intermediate 
        Process type for specific values for these Options Template 
        Records.  For example, in case of an Intermediate Aggregation 
        Process, [IPFIX-MED-AGGR] must specify which values to insert 
        into the fields of "Metering Process Statistics Options 
        Template", "The Metering Process Reliability Statistics Options

        Template", and "The Exporting Process Reliability Statistics 
        Options Template" 
         
         
         
     3.5.3. IPFIX Mediator Options Template 

        There is no need for a specific Options Template for the IPFIX 
        Mediator; instead, each Intermediate Process type requires some 
        particular metadata.  For example, a specification of IPFIX flow 
        anonymisation including an Options Template for the export of 
        metadata about anonymised flows is described in [IPFIX-MED-
        ANON]; when anonymising Flows Records, IPFIX Mediators SHOULD 
        add the Options Template specified therein to annotate the 
        exported dataTransport Session Management 
        SCTP [RFC4960] using the PR-SCTP extension specified in 
        [RFC3758] MUST be implemented by all compliant IPFIX Mediator 
        implementations.  UDP [UDP] MAY also be implemented by compliant 
        IPFIX Mediator implementations.  TCP [TCP] MAY also be 
        implemented by IPFIX Mediator compliant implementations. 

        PR-SCTP SHOULD be used in deployments where IPFIX Mediators and 
        Collectors are communicating over links that are susceptible to 
        congestion.  PR-SCTP is capable of providing any required degree 
        of reliability. 

        TCP MAY be used in deployments where IPFIX Mediators and 
        Collectors communicate over links that are susceptible to 
        congestion, but PR-SCTP is preferred due to its ability to limit 
        back pressure on Exporters and its message versus stream 
        orientation.  

        UDP MAY be used, although it is not a congestion-aware protocol. 
        However, the IPFIX traffic between IPFIX Mediator and Collector 
        MUST run in an environment where IPFIX traffic has been 
        provisioned for, or is contained through some other means. 
         

     3.6. The Collecting Process's Side 

        An IPFIX Mediator MUST produce IPFIX Messages understandable by 
        a RFC5101-compliant IPFIX Collector, with the additional 
        specification in the IPFIX Structured Data [IPFIX-STRUCT]. 
         
        Therefore the Collecting Process on the top Collector MUST 
        support the IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] and the IPFIX Structured 
        Data [IPFIX-STRUCT].

     3.7. Sampling Management 

        EDITOR'S NOTE: What about the accuracy of aggregated Flow 
        Records with the sampling rates? With different sampling rates? 

        In an IPFIX Mediation, aggregation for Flow Records with same 
        sampling rate and same sampling algorithm is recommended.  In 
        that case, an IPFIX Mediator can export this sampling rate and 
        sampling algorithm, and other accuracy statistics data, part of 
        the PSAMP Report Interpretation [RFC5476]. 
         
        In the case where the Mediation aggregates Flow Records with 
        different sampling functions and/or sampling rates, some more 
        research is required to determine the right sampling function 
        and/or sampling rate to export from the IPFIX Mediator.  
        Therefore, this document doesn't describe any specifications, or 
        even guidelines.

        specific flow aggregation draft:

        - activeTime and inactiveTime for Flow aggregation 
          
         
     5. Security Considerations 

        The same security considerations as for the IPFIX Protocol 
        [RFC5101] apply. 
         
        As they act as both IPFIX Collecting Processes and Exporting 
        Processes, the Security Considerations for IPFIX [RFC5101] apply 
        as well to Mediators.  The Security Considerations for IPFIX 
        Files [RFC5655] apply as well to IPFIX Mediators that write 
        IPFIX Files or use them for internal storage.  However, there 
        are a few specific considerations that IPFIX Mediator 
        implementations must take into account in addition. 
         
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 25, 2010           [Page 18] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>   October 2010 
         

        By design, IPFIX Mediators are "men-in-the-middle": they 
        intercede in the communication between an Original Exporter (or 
        another upstream Mediator) and a downstream Collecting Process. 
        This has two important implications for the level of 
        confidentiality provided across an IPFIX Mediator, and the 
        ability to protect data integrity and Original Exporter 
        authenticity across a Mediator. We address these in the 
        following subsections. 
         
         
     5.1. Avoiding Security Downgrade 

        An IPFIX Mediator that accepts IPFIX Messages over a Transport 
        Session protected by TLS or DTLS, and which then exports IPFIX 
        Messages derived there from in cleartext, is a potentially 
        serious vulnerability in an IPFIX infrastructure.  While this is 
        potentially acceptable in the specific case of an IPFIX Mediator 
        at the border of an administrative domain accepting IPFIX 
        Messages from outside the domain and re-exporting derived 
        information via an internal network protected by other means, in 
        the general case this situation SHOULD be avoided. 
         
        Therefore, an IPFIX Mediator that receives IPFIX Messages from 
        an upstream Exporting Process protected using TLS or DTLS MUST 
        provide for sending of IPFIX Messages resulting from the 
        Intermediate Process to a downstream Collecting Process using 
        TLS or DTLS.  It MAY allow for the configuration of unprotected 
        export of such IPFIX Messages, but in this case it MUST warn the 
        administrator that the exported IPFIX Messages will not be 
        protected, and that this could result in the leakage of 
        information deemed by the Original Exporter to be worth 
        protecting. 
         
         
     5.2. End-to-End Assertions for Mediators 

        Because the Transport Session between an IPFIX Mediator and an 
        Original Exporter is independent from the Transport Session 
        between the Mediator and the downstream Collecting Process, 
        there exists no method via TLS to assert the identity of the 
        original Exporting Process downstream.  However, an IPFIX 
        Mediator, which modifies the stream of IPFIX Messages sent to 
        it, is by definition a trusted entity in the infrastructure.  
        Therefore, the IPFIX Mediator's signature on an outgoing 
        Transport Session can be treated as an implicit assertion that 
        the Original Exporter was positively identified by the Mediator 
        and that the source information it received was trustworthy. 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 25, 2010           [Page 19] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>   October 2010 
         

        However, IPFIX Mediators must in this circumstance take care not 
        to provide an inappropriate upgrade of trust. 
         
        Therefore, an IPFIX Mediator SHOULD NOT sign a Transport Session 
        to a downstream Collector unless ALL the Original Exporters from 
        which the information to be exported is derived were positively 
        identified by the Mediator by its certificate.  An exception to 
        this case is the reverse of the special case in the previous 
        subsection: an IPFIX Mediator that accepts information from 
        within a trusted domain via an internal network protected by 
        other means MAY use TLS or DTLS to protect the Transport Session 
        to a downstream Collector outside the domain. 
         
        [EDITOR OPEN ISSUE: We might want to use exporterCertificate and 
        (optionally) collectorCertificate from [RFC5655] here, but I 
        think they need a new Mediator-specific template if so.  If we 
        were to use the templates defined by 5655, it would look like 
        this: 
         
        If the X.509 certificates used to protect a Transport Session 
        between an Original Exporter and an IPFIX Mediator are required 
        downstream, an IPFIX Mediator MAY use the exporterCertificate 
        and the collectorCertificate Information Elements with the 
        Export Session Details Options Template defined in Section 8.1.3 
        of [RFC5655] or the Message Details Options Template defined in 
        Section 8.1.4. of [RFC5655] in order to export this information 
        downstream. However, in this case, the IPFIX Mediator is making 
        an implicit assertion that the upstream Session was properly 
        protected and therefore trustworthy, and as such MUST protect 
        the Transport Session to the downstream Collector using TLS or 
        DTLS, as well. 
      
      
     6. IANA Considerations

      applicationDescription, applicationTag and the applicationName.

      Element registry at [IANA-IPFIX] are listed below.
