1. Introduction 

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6 [RFC3315]) 
   enables DHCP servers to pass configuration parameters. It offers 
   configuration flexibility. If not secured, DHCPv6 is vulnerable to 
   various attacks, particularly fake attack. 

   The requirements of using CGA to secure DHCPv6 have been introduced 
   in [I-D.draft-ietf-csi-dhcpv6-cga-ps]. This document analyzes the 
   security issues of DHCPv6 in more details. This document is aiming to 
   provide mechanisms for improving the security of DHCPv6, thus the 
   address of a DHCP message sender, which can be a DHCP server, a reply 
   agent or a client, is able to be verified by a receiver. It improves 
   communication security of DHCPv6 interaction. The security mechanisms 
   specified in this document is mainly based on the Cryptographically 
   Generated Addresses (CGA [RFC3972]). 

   Secure DHCPv6 is applicable in environments where physical security 
   on the link is not assured (such as over wireless) or where available 
   security mechanisms are not sufficient, and attacks on DHCPv6 are a 
   concern. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. Security Overview of DHCPv6 

   DHCPv6 is a client/server protocol that provides managed and stateful 
   configuration of devices. It enables DHCPv6 server to auto-configure 
   relevant network parameters on clients through the DHCPv6 message 
   exchanging mechanisms. In the basic DHCPv6 specifications [RFC3315], 
   security of DHCPv6 message can be improved in a few aspects. 

   In the basic DHCPv6 specifications, regular IPv6 addresses are used. 
   It is possible for a malicious attacker to use a fake address to 
   spoof or launch an attack. 

   "One attack specific to a DHCP client is the establishment of a 
   malicious server with the intent of providing incorrect configuration 
   information to the client. The motivation for doing so may be to 
   mount a 'man in the middle' attack that causes the client to 
   communicate with a malicious server instead of a valid server for 
   some service such as DNS or NTP. The malicious server may also mount 
   a denial of service attack through mis-configuration of the client

   that causes all network communication from the client to fail." 
   [RFC3315] 

   "A DHCP client may also be subject to attack through the receipt of a 
   Reconfigure message from a malicious server that causes the client to 
   obtain incorrect configuration information from that server." 
   [RFC3315] 

   Fake servers can also provide clients with partially correct 
   information that allows the attacker to route traffic through certain 
   host where critical information can be collected. This becomes 
   important to detect and prevent when encrypted traffic is allowed to 
   pass through firewalls. Clients can be configured with bogus data, so 
   that they will assume that the network is down. 

   Once servers start updating DNS and other directory services, 
   attackers may spoof DHCP servers to register incorrect information in 
   those services. 

   Another possible attack is that attackers may be able to gain 
   unauthorized access to some resources, such as network access. 

   The basic DHCPv6 specifications achieve message origin authentication 
   and message integrity via an authentication option with a symmetric 
   key pair. For the key of the hash function, there are two key 
   management mechanisms. Firstly, the key management is out of band, 
   usually manual, i.e. operators set up key database for both server 
   and client before running DHCPv6. Usually multiple keys are deployed 
   once a time and key id is used to specify which key is used. Secondly, 
   a DHCPv6 server sends a reconfigure key to the client in the initial 
   exchange of DHCPv6 messages for future use, in this case security is 
   not guaranteed because this key is transmitted in plaintext. In 
   either way, the security of key itself is in question mark. 

   Communication between a server and a relay agent, and communication 
   between relay agents, can be secured through the use of IPSec, as 
   described in section 21.1 in [RFC3315]. However, IPSec is quite 
   complicated. A simpler security mechanism may have better deploy 
   ability. Furthermore, the manual configuration and static keys are 
   potential issue makers. Relay agents MAY require other security 
   mechanisms besides IPSec. 

4. Secure DHCPv6 Overview 

   To solve the abovementioned security issues, we introduce CGAs into 
   DHCPv6. CGAs are introduced in [RFC3972]. "CGAs are IPv6 addresses 
   for which the interface identifier is generated by computing a 
   cryptographic one-way hash function from a public key and auxiliary 
   parameters. The binding between the public key and the address can be 
   verified by re-computing the hash value and by comparing the hash

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6-00.txt        April 2010 
 
   with the interface identifier. Messages sent from an IPv6 address can 
   be protected by attaching the public key and auxiliary parameters and 
   by signing the message with the corresponding private key. The 
   protection works without a certification authority or any security 
   infrastructure." 

   In this document, a CGA option with an address ownership proof 
   mechanism and a signature option with a corresponding verification 
   mechanism are introduced. With them, the receiver of a DHCP message 
   can verify the sender address of the DHCP message, which improves 
   communication security of DHCP messages. By using the signature 
   option, the verification of data integrity and replay protections can 
   also be achieved without the authentication option. 

   This documentation focuses on using CGAs to secure the DHCPv6 
   protocol. It assumes the sender, which uses CGAs, has self-generated 
   or been configured CGAs. The CGA configuration in the DHCPv6 network 
   is out of scope and specified in [I-D.draft-jiang-dhc-cga-config-
   dhcpv6]. 

   In the relay scenarios, because relay agent restructures the DHCPv6 
   messages, a receiver would not find the sender's source CGA address 
   in the DHCPv6 message header. In the client-relay-server scenarios, 
   "the relay agent copies the source address from the header of the IP 
   datagram in which the message was received to the peer-address field 
   of the Relay-forward message" [RFC3315]. The receiver, a DHCPv6 
   server, can find the sender's source CGA address in the peer-address 
   field for CGA verification. In the server-relay-client scenarios, a 
   DHCP server knows a client is behind relay(s) if it receives a Relay-
   forward DHCPv6 message. Then it will reply a Relay-reply message with 
   the server's source CGA address being carried in the server DUID, 
   which is in the payload. In this way, the receiver, a DHCPv6 client 
   can get the server's source CGA address for CGA verification. The 
   server DUID is also protected by CGA. 

4.1. New Components 

   The components of the solution specified in this document are as 
   follows: 

      - CGAs are used to make sure that the sender of a DHCPv6 message 
        is the "owner" of the claimed address. A public-private key 
        pair has been generated by a node itself or configured before 
        it can claim an address. A new DHCPv6 option, the CGA Parameter 
        Option, is used to carry the public key and associated 
        parameters. 

      - Public key signatures protect the integrity of the messages and 
        authenticate the identity of their sender. The authority of a 
        public key is established either with the authorization

        delegation process, by using certificates, or through the 
        address ownership proof mechanism, by using CGAs, or with both. 

      - Server Address type of DUID is used to carry server's source 
        address in the relay scenarios. The receiver gets the server's 
        source CGA address for CGA verification. 

4.2. Support for algorithm agility 

   Hash functions are the fundamental of security mechanisms, including 
   CGAs in this document. "...they have two security properties: to be 
   one way and collision free." "The recent attacks have demonstrated 
   that one of those security properties is not true." [RFC4270] 

   Following the approach recommended by [RFC4270] and [NewHash], our 
   analysis shows none of these attacks are currently doable. However, 
   these attacks indicate the possibility of future real-world attacks. 
   Therefore, we have to take into account that future attacks will be 
   improved and provide a support for multiple hash algorithms. Our 
   mechanisms, in this document, support not only hash algorithm agility 
   but also signature algorithm agility. 

   The support for hash agility within CGAs has been defined in 
   [RFC4982]. The usage of CGAs in this document SHOULD also obey 
   [RFC4982], too. 

5. Extension for Secure DHCPv6 

   This section extends DHCPv6. Two new options and a new DUID type have 
   been defined. The new options MUST be supported, if the node has been 
   configured to use Secure DHCPv6. The new DUID type MUST be supported 
   in the relay scenarios. 

5.1. CGA Parameter Option 

   The CGA option allows the verification of the sender's CGAs. The 
   format of the CGA option is described as follows: 

        0                   1                   2                   3

       CGA Parameters   A variable-length field containing the CGA 
                       Parameters data structure described in Section 4 
                       of [RFC3972]. This specification requires that 
                       the public key found from the CGA Parameters 
                       field in the CGA option MUST be that referred by 
                       the Key Hash field in the Signature option. 
                       Packets received with two different keys MUST be 
                       silently discarded. Note that a future extension 
                       MAY provide a mechanism allowing the owner of an 
                       address and the signer to be different parties. 

5.2. Signature Option 

   The Signature option allows public key-based signatures to be 
   attached to a DHCPv6 message. The Signature option COULD be any place 
   within the DHCPv6 message. It protects all the DHCPv6 header and 
   options before it. Any options after the Signature option can be 
   processed, but it should be noticed that they are not protected by 
   this Signature option. The format of the Signature option is 
   described as follows: 

        0                   1                   2                   3

                       The SHA-1 hash is taken over the presentation 
                       used in the Public Key field of the CGA 
                       Parameters data structure carried in the CGA 
                       option. Its purpose is to associate the 
                       signature to a particular key known by the 
                       receiver. Such a key can either be stored in the 
                       certificate cache of the receiver or be received 
                       in the CGA option in the same message. 

       Signature       A variable-length field containing a digital 
                       signature. The signature value is computed with 
                       the hash algorithm and the signature algorithm, 
                       as described in HA-id and SA-id. The signature 
                       constructed by using the sender's private key 
                       over the following sequence of octets:

   In the secure DHCPv6 solution, all the payloads, including DUID-SA,  
   are protected by signature option by the definition of section 5.1 
   and 5.2.  

6. Processing Rules and Behaviors 

6.1. Processing Rules of Sender 

   A DHCPv6 node, which could be a server, relay agent or client, can be 
   configured to send Secure DHCPv6 messages only if CGAs have been 
   configured on it. 

   The node MUST record the following configuration information: 

       CGA parameters   Any information required to construct CGAs, as 
                       described in [RFC3972]. 

       Keypair        A public-private key pair. The public key used 
                       for constructing the signature MUST be the same 
                       in CGA parameters. 

       CGA flag        A flag that indicates whether CGA is used or not. 

   If a node has been configured to use Secure DHCPv6, the node MUST 
   send a message using a CGA, which be constructed as specified in 
   Section 4 of [RFC3972], as the source address unless they are sent 
   with the unspecified source address. In the message, both the CGA 
   option and the Signature option MUST be present in all DHCPv6 
   messages. The CGA Parameter field in the CGA option is filled 
   according to the rules presented above and in [RFC3972]. The public 
   key in the field is taken from the configuration used to generate the 
   CGA, typically from a data structure associated with the source 
   address. The Signature option MUST be constructed as explained in 
   Section 5.2 and be the last DHCPv6 option. 

   In relay scenario, a DHCPv6 server MUST include an OPTION_SERVERID 
   [RFC3315] in Relay-reply message and put its CGA in the Server 
   Address field of the DUID in the OPTION_SERVERID. The CGA of DHCPv6 
   server will not lose during relaying so that the client can verify 
   CGA address and signature. 

6.2. Processing Rules of Receiver 

   The node that supports the verification of the Secure DHCPv6 messages 
   MUST record the following configuration information: 

       Minbits        The minimum acceptable key length for public 
                       keys used in the generation of CGAs. The default 
                       SHOULD be 1024 bits. Implementations MAY also 
                       set an upper limit for the amount of computation

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6-00.txt        April 2010 
 
                       needed when verifying packets that use these 
                       security associations. Any implementation SHOULD 
                       follow prudent cryptographic practice in 
                       determining the appropriate key lengths. 

   On a node that has been configured to use Secure DHCPv6, DHCPv6 
   message without either the CGA option or the Signature option MUST be 
   treated as unsecured. Note the Secure DHCPv6 nodes MAY simply discard 
   the unsecured messages. 

   The receiving node MUST verify the source address of the packet by 
   using the algorithm described in Section 5 of [RFC3972]. The inputs 
   to the algorithm are the source address, as used in IP header, and 
   the CGA Parameters field. 

   If the CGA verification is successful, the recipient proceeds with a 
   more time-consuming cryptographic check of the signature. Note that 
   even if the CGA verification succeeds, no claims about the validity 
   of the use can be made until the signature has been checked. 

   The receiving node MUST verify the Signature option as follows: the 
   Key Hash field MUST indicate the use of a known public key, either 
   one learned from a preceding CGA option in the same message, or one 
   known by other means. The signature field verification MUST show that 
   the signature has been calculated as specified in the previous 
   section. 

   Only the messages that get through both CGA and signature 
   verifications are accepted as secured DHCPv6 messages and continue to 
   be handled for their contained DHCPv6 options. 

   Messages that do not pass all the above tests MUST be silently 
   discarded if the host has been configured to accept only secured 
   DHCPv6 messages. The messages MAY be accepted if the host has been 
   configured to accept both secured and unsecured messages but MUST be 
   treated as an unsecured message. The receiver MAY also otherwise 
   silently discard packets. 

   In the relay scenarios, a DHCPv6 server obtains the CGA of a client 
   from the peer address field in the Relay-forward message. A DHCPv6 
   client obtains the CGA of a server from the Server Address field of 
   the DUID in the OPTION_SERVERID. 

6.3. Processing Rules of Relay Agent 

   To support secure DHCPv6, Relay Agents follow the same processing 
   rules defined in [RFC3315]. 

   By current definition: "The relay agent copies the source address 
   from the IP datagram in which the message was received from the

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6-00.txt        April 2010 
 
   client into the peer-address field in the Relay-forward message". The 
   CGA of a client will not lose during relaying. 

   A relay will not change the OPTION_SERVERID when processing Relay-
   reply message from a DHCPv6 server, CGA of the DHCPv6 server will not 
   lose. 

7. Security Considerations 

   This document provides new security features to the DHCPv6 protocol. 

   DHCPv6 nodes without CGAs or the DHCPv6 messages that use unspecific 
   addresses cannot be protected. 

   Downgrade attacks cannot be avoided if nodes are configured to accept 
   both secured and unsecured messages. A future specification MAY 
   provide a mechanism on how to treat unsecured DHCPv6 messages. One 
   simple solution MAY be that Secure DHCPv6 is mandated on all servers, 
   reply agents and clients if a certain link has been deployed Secure 
   DHCPv6. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines two new DHCPv6 [RFC3315] options, which MUST be 
   assigned Option Type values within the option numbering space for 
   DHCPv6 messages: 

       The CGA Parameter Option (TBA1), described in Section 5.1. 

       The Signature Option (TBA2), described in Section 5.2. 

   This document defines a new DHCPv6 DUID, which MUST be assigned DUID 
   Type values within the DHCPv6 DUID Type numbering space: 

      The DUID-SA (TBA3), described in Section 5.3. 

   This document defines three new registries that have been created and 
   are maintained by IANA. Initial values for these registries are given 
   below. Future assignments are to be made through Standards Action 
   [RFC5226]. Assignments for each registry consist of a name, a value 
   and a RFC number where the registry is defined. 

   Hash Algorithm id (HA-id). The values in this name space are 16-bit 
   unsigned integers. The following initial values are assigned for HA-
   id in this document: 

             Name        |  Value  |  RFCs 
      -------------------+---------+------------ 
            SHA-1        |  0x0000 | this document

   Signature Algorithm id (SA-id). The values in this name space are 16-
   bit unsigned integers. The following initial values are assigned for 
   SA-id in this document: 

             Name        |  Value  |  RFCs 
      -------------------+---------+------------ 
            SHA-1        |  0x0000 | this document 

   Hash Algorithm id for Key Hash (HA-id-KH). The values in this name 
   space are 16-bit unsigned integers. The following initial values are 
   assigned for HA-id-KH in this document: 

             Name        |  Value  |  RFCs 
      -------------------+---------+------------ 
       RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 |  0x0000 | this document 

   This document defines a new 128-bit value under the CGA Message Type 
   [RFC3972] namespace, 0x81be a1eb 0021 ce7e caa9 4090 0665 d2e0 02c2.
