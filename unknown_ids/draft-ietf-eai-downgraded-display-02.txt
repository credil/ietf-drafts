1.  Introduction

   The Email Address Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension document
   set [RFC4952] [RFC5336] [RFC5335] [RFC5337] expands Email address
   structure, syntax and Email header format.  To avoid rejection of
   internationalized Email messages, the downgrading mechanism [RFC5504]
   converts an internationalized message to a traditional Email message
   when a server in the delivery path does not support the UTF8SMTP
   extension.  The downgraded message is a traditional Email message,
   except the message has "Downgraded-" header fields.

   A perfect reverse-function of the downgrading does not exist because
   the encoding defined in [RFC2047] is not exactly reversible and
   Received header field downgrading may remove FOR clause information.
   The restoration of the downgrading should be done once at the final
   destination of the downgraded message such as MUAs or IMAP servers.
   This document describes the restoration methods as displaying
   downgraded messages in MUAs.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Specialized terms used in this specification are defined in the EAI
   overview [RFC4952] or in [RFC5321][RFC5322], MIME documents [RFC2045]
   [RFC2047] [RFC2183] [RFC2231].

   This document depends on [RFC5335] and [RFC5504].  Key words used in
   these document are used in this document, too.

   The term "non-ASCII" is an UTF-8 string which contains at least one
   non-ASCII character.

   The term "address header field" is used for a header field which
   contains <mailbox> elements which is defined in [RFC5322].  "Address
   header fields" contain "From", "Sender", "Reply-To", "To", "Cc",
   "Bcc", "Resent-From", "Resent-Sender", "Resent-To", "Resent-Cc",
   "Return-Path" header fields.

   An "UTF8SMTP message" is an Email messages expanded by [RFC5335].

   The term "MIME decode" is used for both "encoded-word" decoding
   defined by [RFC2047] and MIME parameter value decoding defined by
   [RFC2231].

3.  Consideration of displaying downgraded message

   Displaying downgraded message is mostly performed by MIME decoding
   according to [RFC2047] and [RFC2231].  As a result of MIME decoding,
   the header of the message still contains "Downgraded-" header fields,
   but the header field bodies are MIME decoded.  These decoded
   "Downgraded-" header fields contain the original header field name
   and the original header field values.  The recipient can read them.
   But the recipient's MUA cannot use the original header fields
   automatically.

   Additionally, A MUA can process "Downgraded-" header fields.

   The easiest way to process "Downgraded-" header fields is to remove
   "Downgraded-" from the decoded "Downgraded-" header fields' names.
   Then, the "address header fields" may be displayed twice, one is from
   downgraded header field and the other is from decoded "Downgraded-"
   header field.  Although it is very easy, it MUST NOT be used because
   of the following reasons.
   o  [RFC5322] section 3.6 defines number of times each field may occur
      in the header section of a message and the maximum number for
      "From", "Sender", "To", "Cc", "Bcc" header fields is 1.  It
      violates [RFC5322].
   o  Users cannot distinguish which is the original downgraded header
      field and which is the generated header field.
   o  The "Downgraded-" header field and corresponding header field may
      not have relations.


4.  Displaying downgraded message

   A MUA MAY decode and re-generate the original header fields of the
   message.  This procedure can be used to reverse the Downgrade process
   but will not construct exactly the original header fields in all
   cases.

   Displaying downgraded message is implemented by the following steps.

   Input:
      The input to this procedure is the header of the message as
      received.  Copy the entire header into an edit space.

   Step 1:
      Select the "Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields"
      described in Section 3.2 of [RFC5504] in the edit space.  These
      header fields are "Downgraded-From", "Downgraded-Sender",
      "Downgraded-To", "Downgraded-Cc", "Downgraded-Bcc", "Downgraded-
      Reply-To", "Downgraded-Resent-From", "Downgraded-Resent-Sender",

      "Downgraded-Resent-To", "Downgraded-Resent-Cc", "Downgraded-
      Resent-Bcc", "Downgraded-Resent-Reply-To", "Downgraded-Return-
      Path" and "Downgraded-Disposition-Notification-To" header fields.

   Step 2:
      For each header field from the output of Step 1, generate a new
      header field where the field name is the original header field
      name and the field value is the result of MIME decoding header
      field value.

   Step 3:
      Apply "Email Header Fields Downgrading" defined in section 5 of
      [RFC5504] to the output of Step 2 without re-generating
      "Downgraded-" header fields and copy the output into a new space
      (hereafter, call it as a "comparison space").

   Step 4:
      Compare the header fields in the comparison space with the header
      fields of the same name in the edit space.  Before this
      comparison, canonicalize each header field described below.

      1.  Unfold all header field continuation lines as described in
          [RFC5322].
      2.  Insert a space character before and after <mailbox-list>
          separator "," if there is no space character.
      3.  Insert a space character before and after <comment> if there
          is no space character.
      4.  Decode each <encoded-word> whose charset is 'UTF-8'.
      5.  Convert all sequences of one or more WSP characters to a
          single space character.  WSP characters here include those
          before and after a line folding boundary.
      6.  Delete all WSP characters at the end of each unfolded header
          field value.
      7.  Delete any WSP characters remaining before and after the colon
          separating the header field name from the header field value.
          The colon separator MUST be retained.

      For each header field, if the same header fields exist in the
      comparison space and in the edit space, remove the original header
      field in the edit space and the generated header field in the
      comparison space.

      Remaining header fields in the comparison space may be bogus or
      broken "Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields" origin.

Internet-Draft       Displaying Downgraded Messages             Sep 2009


   Step 5:
      Decode all MIME encoded header fields according to [RFC2047] and
      [RFC2231] in the edit space.

   Step 6:
      For each "Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields"
      described in section 3.3 of [RFC5504] and "Address Header Fields'
      Preservation Header Fields", generate a new header field where the
      field name is the original header field name and the field value
      is the result of MIME decoding header field value, then replace
      the original "Downgraded-" header field by the generated header
      field in the edit space.  "Envelope Information Preservation
      Header Fields" are not targets of this step.


   The output of this procedure is an UTF8SMTP header in the edit space.
   It will closely resemble the original header.

   After this procedure, the MUA may decode MIME body part header fields
   according to [RFC2047] and [RFC2231].


5.  Security considerations

   While information in any email header should usually treated with
   some suspicion, current email systems commonly employ various
   mechanisms and protocols to make the information more trustworthy.
   For example, an organization's boundary MTA can modify "From:" lines
   so that messages arriving from outside the organization are easily
   distinguishable from internal emails.  As a result of rewriting, the
   "Downgraded-From" header field may not be decoded.

   A MUA may emphasize bogus or broken "Downgraded-" header fields in
   step 4 of Section 4.

   Hiding the information from the actual header fields when using the
   "Downgraded-" header fields does not cause loss of information if the
   comparison done in step 4 of Section 4 is successful.  To ensure that
   no information is lost, a MUA SHOULD have a function that uses the
   actual message that was received (with/without MIME decoding) to
   render the message.

   See "Security considerations" section in [RFC5504] and [RFC4952] for
   more discussion.
