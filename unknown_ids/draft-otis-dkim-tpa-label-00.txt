Abstract

   TPA-label is a DNS-based prefix mechanism for DKIM policy related
   records as a means to authorize Third-Party domains, such as mailing-
   lists.  This mechanism allows first-party domains to autonomously

   authorize a range of third-party domains using scalable, individual
   DNS transactions.  This authorization extends the scope of DKIM
   policy assertions as a means to supplant more difficult to administer
   mechanisms.  Alternatives for facilitating third-party authorizations
   currently necessitate coordination between two or more domains to
   synchronously set up selector/key DNS records, DNS zone delegations,
   or the regular exchange of public/private keys.

   Checking DKIM policies may occur when a From header email-address is
   not within the domain of a valid DKIM signature.  When a Third-Party
   signature is found, TPA-Labels offer an efficient means for email
   address domains to authorize specific third-party signing domains.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes how any email-address domain publishing DKIM
   policy records such as those defined in [RFC5617] can also
   autonomously authorize [RFC4871] signing by specific third-party
   domains.  Recommended or suggested actions for DKIM receivers are not
   included, and are considered "out-of-scope" for this document.  The
   receiver is assumed to better understand their environment's impact
   upon the performance of DKIM signatures and how results are best
   utilized.

   TPA-Labels authorize signing domains as a means to permit compliance
   with DKIM policies such those defined by [RFC5617].  TPA-Label
   authorized domains are to be considered equivalent to the authorizing
   domain for the application of DKIM policies.  The TXT records
   associated with these TPA-Labels start with the 'dkim' tag defined by
   [RFC5617] in addition to assertions that are specifically for TPA-
   Labels as defined within this document.  This mechanism can eliminate
   the complex coordination of selector/key DNS records, DNS delegation,
   or exchanges of public/private keys between two or more domains that
   would otherwise be required to facilitate otherwise transparent
   authorizations.

   Trust is an essential requisite before the DKIM signature header
   field's 'i=' semantics provide valuable advisory information.  This
   advisory information is in regard to the "on-behalf-of" identity as a
   means to enable safer message annotations and to better ensure
   trusted identities are recognized.  In the case of third-party
   signatures, the i= value will not directly reflect an email-address
   found witin the From header, but would be in the form of an alias.

   TPA-Labels convey which third-party domains are authoritative.
   Third-party domains are unable to utilize DKIM signature's 'i='
   semantics to directly assert which identifiers on whose behalf a
   signature was added.  As such, no third-party domain should be
   authorized unless it is trusted to ensure that submitting entities
   have demonstrated receipt of messages sent to the From header address
   contained within message being signed.


2.  Evaluating Signing Domains

   Regulatory agencies are unable to control Internet abuse by
   curtailing access.  Unlike IPv4 addresses, there is virtually no
   limit on the number of domain-names available.  Registrar pricing of
   domain-names need to remain uniform.  Otherwise, fees based upon the
   intrinsic value of a name could cause name holders to become
   extortion targets.  High initial costs for domain-names are also



Otis                     Expires April 10, 2010                 [Page 4]

   unlikely to represent a deterrent, largely due to high levels of
   payment fraud.

   In addition, DKIM can not directly identify the domain transmitting
   the message, and can not prevent abusive message replay.  Abusive
   message replay may prove indistinguishable from bulk mailings of
   various types.  Since abuse may be beyond the control of the signing
   domain, message acceptance will likely remain dependent upon the
   reputation of the SMTP client's IP address and associated hosts, and
   perhaps that of the identity represented within the 'i=' parameter
   found within the DKIM signature header.  Abuse reporting facilitated
   by DKIM signatures should therefore first select signing domains that
   correspond with domains administering the SMTP Client publicly
   transmitting the message.  As such, correspondence between the SMTP
   Client host and the DKIM signing domain might also be affirmed by
   TPA-Label authorizations.

   The receiver's domain evaluation process will confront many domains
   with unknown reputations.  New domains are constantly being
   introduced where registrars are unable to prevent bad actors from
   controlling either a new or previously held domain names.  The
   receiver may seek to limit the DKIM verification process, since
   acquiring policy records or DKIM keys may inadvertently leak valuable
   information that benefit bad actors.  Processing all DKIM signatures
   may also inundate a receiver's limited resources.  As a result,
   validating DKIM signatures and obtaining related resource records
   might become limited to known trustworthy domains.  Signing domains
   authorized with TPA-Labels by domains having good reputations might
   then provide a means to safely extend limited verification resources.


3.  Authorization Scope

   Without using TPA-Labels, an authorization effort will likely involve
   sharing details between the domain owner, and one or more email and
   DNS providers.  Since there are many ways in which such
   authorizations can be accomplished, it is unlikely there will be
   consistent or standardized formats developed to exchange necessary,
   and at times, sensitive information.  In addition, when there is a
   security breach, the wrong party might be held accountable for
   content they may have never seen nor logged.  The TPA-Label
   authorization scheme permits the content of the DKIM signature header
   to clarify who signed the message and on whose behalf, while also
   permitting greater control by the authorizing domain.

   TPA-Label resource records replace domain delegations, selector/key
   record mirroring, or key exchanges.  Significant amounts of detail is
   associated with selector/key records.  These details include user

   limitations, suitable services, key resource record's Time-To-Live,
   revocation and update procedures, and how the DKIM Signature header
   field's 'i=' semantics are to be applied.  The TPA-Labeled policy
   records allow authorizing domains an improved ability to limit the
   scope of their authorizations, without being mistaken for having
   authenticated the entity submitting the message.

   When a signing domain differs from that of a domain within the header
   email-address, TPA-Label resource records safely extend policy
   compliance where DNS publication is only required by the email-
   address domain even when signing domains and the email-address
   domains differ.  While offering only valid signatures will not ensure
   all possible spoofing is prevented, messages signed in this manner
   should not receive annotations indicating there are authenticated
   identities either.  Authorizing domains to play the role of only
   providing acceptable signatures may be suitable for non-critical
   messages, where the goal might be to improve delivery acceptance,
   such as those from mailing-lists.


4.  TPA-Label Tag Definitions

   Every TPA-Label TXT resource record MUST start with an outbound
   signing-practices tag, so the first four characters of the record are
   lowercase "dkim", followed by optional whitespace and "=".  In
   addition to tags defined by [RFC5617], TPA-Label syntax descriptions
   use the form described in Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications
   [RFC5234].  The "base32" function is defined in [RFC4648] and the
   "sha-1" hash function is defined in [FIPS.180-2.2002].  The TPA-Label
   TXT resource records follow the tag-value syntax described in section
   4.2.1 of [RFC5617] and section 3.2 of [RFC4871].  Unrecognized tags
   and tags with illegal values MUST be ignored.  In the ABNF below, the
   WSP token is inherited from [RFC5322].  The ALPHA and DIGIT tokens
   are imported from [RFC5234].  The function "lcase" converts upper-
   case ALPHA characters to lower-case.  The function "sha-1" returns a
   hash that is converted to a base32 character set.  The terminating
   period is not included in domain-name conversions.  In addition, a
   newline character (0x0A) is appended to the end of the string to
   match a command line generation of SHA1 values.  The tags used in
   TPA-Labeled policy records are as follows:

     asterisk = %x2A ; "*"
     dash = %x2D ; "-"
     dot = %x2E ; "."
     underscore = %x5F ; "_"
     ANY = asterisk dot ; "*."
     dns-char = ALPHA / DIGIT / dash
     id-prefix = ALPHA / DIGIT

            +--------------+----------------------------------+

                          TPA-Label Scope Values

   The receiver obtains the TPA-Label record for the email-address
   domain using a DNS query for an IN class TXT resource record.  The
   TPA-Label is created by processing the domain found within the
   signature's "d=" parameter (does not include the trailing period).
   The TPA-Label would be placed below the normal policy records, for
   example "._adsp.domainkey.<email-address domain>".  These labels
   would then be used to access the TPA-Labeled policy TXT records.
   Character-strings contained within the TXT resource record are
   concatenated into forming a single string.  A character-string is a
   single length octet followed by that number of characters treated as
   binary information.  As an example, a TPA-Labeled policy record may
   be located at these domains:

      <tpa-label>._adsp._domainkey.<email-address domain>.



5.  Scope

   scope= Authorization Scope List (Optional).  This tag defines a list
   of scoping assertions for various email-address locations within the

   message.

      scope = "F" / "O" / "M" / "H" / "NO-TPA"
      as-list = "scope" [WSP] "=" [WSP] scope 0*([WSP] ":" [WSP] scope)

5.1.  From (Author) Header Field

   The "F" scope asserts that messages carrying the email-address domain
   within the From header field are authorized to be signed by the tpa
   listed domain.


5.2.  MailFrom Parameter

   This "M" scope asserts that messages carrying the email-address
   domain within the MailFrom parameter are also authorized to be signed
   by the authorized domain.


5.3.  Other Originating Header Fields

   The "O" scope asserts that messages carrying the email-address domain
   within the Sender or Resent-* header fields are authorized to be
   signed by the authorized domain.


5.4.  SMTP Host domains

   The "H" scope asserts that messages transmitted by SMTP hosts have
   been authorized.  This scope might be used to better ensure DKIM
   signatures are validated.


5.5.  NO-TPA

   The "NO-TPA" scope asserts that domain does not publish TPA-Labeled
   policy records.



6.  Authorized Signing Domain

   tpa= Authorized Signing Domain list (Optional).  This tag repeats all
   or portions of the domain encoded within the TPA-Label.  This option
   ensures proper handling of possible hash collisions.  When a domain
   is prefixed with the "*."  ANY label, then all subdomains of this
   domain are to be considered included within the list.

      ad = [ANY] domain
      ad-list = "tpa" [WSP] "=" [WSP] ad 0*([WSP] ":" [WSP] ad)




7.  Use of TPA-Label Resource Records

   Use of TPA-Label resource record assertions need not be are
   subsequent to the discovery of the policy record specified by
   [RFC5617].  When an acceptable First-Party signature was not
   discovered, and the From domain's [RFC5617] resource record contains
   the "scope" tag then:

      When one or more valid Third-Party Signatures are present in the
      message, and a scope tag exists within the normal policy record,
      and the scope tag does not contain "NO-TPA", then:
      *  When a TPA-Label TXT resource record within the From header
         domain has a scope tag of "F" and the email-address domain
         within the From headers is within the authorizing domain, then
         the message is considered signed with an Author's Domain
         Acceptable Third-Party Signature.
      *  When a TPA-Label TXT resource record within the From header
         domain has a scope tag of "O" and the email-address domain
         within the Sender, or Resent-* headers are within the
         authorizing domain, then the message is considered signed with
         an Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party Signature.
      *  When no TPA-Label TXT resource record is found or published,
         and a valid Third-party signature is acceptable to the
         verifier, then the message is considered signed by a Verifier
         Acceptable Third-Party Signature.


8.  IANA Considerations

   A registry has been established for DKIM policy record tags for
   RFC5617 which will need updated with the tags "tpa" and "scope".

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


9.  Security Considerations

   This draft extends signing policies related to [RFC4871].  Security
   considerations are mostly related to attempts on the part of
   malicious senders to represent themselves as other senders, often in
   an attempt to defraud either the recipient or the alleged originator.

Internet-Draft                  TPA-Label                   October 2009


   Additional security considerations regarding DKIM signing practices
   may be found in the DKIM threat analysis [RFC4686].

   The use of the SHA-1 hash algorithm does not represent a security
   concern.  The hash simply ensures a deterministic domain-name size is
   achieved.  Unexpected collisions can be detected and handled by using
   the extended TPA-Label "tpa=" option.
