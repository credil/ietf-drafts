      Transport of Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) Messages
             draft-moriarty-post-inch-rid-transport-01.txt

Abstract

   Documents intended to be shared among multiple constituencies must
   share a common format and transport mechanism.  The Incident Object
   Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a common XML format for
   document exchange, and Realtime Internetwork Defense (RID) defines
   extensions to IODEF intended for the cooperative handling of security
   incidents within consortia of network operators and enterprises.
   This document outlines the transport of IODEF and RID messages over
   HTTP/TLS.

Internet-Draft                RID Transport                 January 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) [RFC5070]
   describes an XML document format for the purpose of exchanging data
   between Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) or those
   responsible for security incident handling for network providers
   (NPs).  The defined document format provides an easy way for CSIRTs
   to exchange data in a way which can be easily parsed.

   IODEF defines a message format, not a transport protocol, as the
   sharing of messages is assumed to be out of scope in order to allow
   CSIRTs to exchange and store messages in a way most suited to their
   established incident handling processes.  However, extensions such as
   Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) [I-D.moriarty-post-inch-rid] do
   require a specification of a transport protocol to ensure
   interoperability among members in a RID consortium.  This document
   specifies the transport of RID messages within HTTP [RFC2616] Request
   and Response messages transported over TLS [RFC5246] (herein, HTTP/
   TLS).  Note that any IODEF message may also be transported using this
   mechanism, by sending it as a RID Report message.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Transmission of RID Messages over HTTP/TLS

   This section specifies the details of the transport of RID messages
   over HTTP/TLS.  In this arrangement, each RID server is both an HTTP/
   TLS server and an HTTP/TLS Client.  When a RID message must be sent,
   the sending RID system connects to the receiving RID system and sends
   the message, optionally receiving a message in reply.  All RID
   systems MUST be prepared to accept HTTP/TLS connections from any RID
   peer with which it communicates, in order to support callback for
   delayed replies (see below).

   BCP 56 [RFC3205] contains a number of important considerations when
   using HTTP for application protocols.  These include the size of the
   payload for the application, whether the application will use a web
   browser, whether the protocol should be defined on a port other than
   80, and if the security provided through HTTP/TLS suits the needs of
   the new application.

   It is acknowledged within the scope of these concerns that HTTP/TLS

   is not ideally suited for RID transport, as the former is a client-
   server protocol and the latter a message-exchange protocol; however,
   the ease of implementation of RID systems over HTTP/TLS outweighs
   these concerns.  Consistent with BCP 56, RID systems will listen for
   TCP connections on port [IANA NOTE: assigned port goes here].  Every
   RID system participating in a consortium MUST listen for HTTP/TLS
   connections on the assigned port.

   All RID messages sent in HTTP Requests MUST be sent using the POST
   with a Request-URI of /; additional Request-URI paths are reserved
   for future use by RID.

   The following table lists the allowable RID message types in an HTTP
   Response for a given RID message type in the Request.  A RID system
   MUST be prepared to handle an HTTP Response of the given type(s) when
   sending the corresponding HTTP Request.  A RID system MUST NOT send
   an HTTP Response containing any RID message other than the one
   corresponding to the one sent in the HTTP Request.

   As the queries and replies in a RID message exchange may be
   significantly separated in time, the receiving RID system MAY return
   202 Accepted, terminate the connection, and connect to the requesting
   RID system and sending the RID reply in an HTTP Request at a later
   time.  This mechanism is referred to in this document as "RID
   callback".  When performing RID callback, a responding system MUST
   connect to the network- and transport-layer addresses from which the
   original request was sent; there is no mechanism in RID for
   redirected callback.

   While a RID system SHOULD return the reply in an HTTP Response if it
   is available immediately or within a generally accepted HTTP client
   time out (about thirty seconds), this is not mandatory, and as such
   RID systems MUST be prepared for a query to be met with a 202
   Accepted, an empty Response body, a connection termination and a
   callback.

   RID systems accepting a callback message in an HTTP Request MUST
   return 202 Accepted.

   The following table lists the allowable request/response pairs for
   RID.

   For security purposes, RID systems SHOULD NOT return 3xx Redirect
   response codes, and MUST NOT follow any 3xx Redirect.  When a RID
   System's address changes, contact point information within the
   consortium must be updated out of band.

   If a RID system receives an improper RID message in an HTTP Request,
   it MUST return an appropriate 4xx Client Error result code to the
   requesting RID system.  If a RID system cannot process a RID message
   received in an HTTP Request due to an error on its own side, it MUST
   return an appropriate 5xx Server Error result code to the requesting
   RID system.

   Note that HTTP provides no mechanism for signaling to a server than a
   response body is improper.  If an RID system receives and improper
   RID message in an HTTP Response, or cannot process a RID message
   received in an HTTP Response due to an error on its own side, it MUST
   log the error and present it to the RID system administrator for
   handling; the error logging format is an implementation detail and is
   considered out of scope for this specification.

   RID systems MUST support and SHOULD use HTTP/1.1 persistent
   connections as described in [RFC2616] to minimize TCP connection
   setup overhead.  RID systems MUST support chunked transfer encoding
   on the HTTP server side to allow the implementation of clients that
   do not need to precalculate message sizes before constructing HTTP
   headers.

   RID systems MUST use TLS for confidentiality, identification, and
   strong mutual authentication as in [RFC2818]; see Section 4 below for
   details.

4.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations of related documents MUST be considered,
   especially the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF)
   [RFC5070] and Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID)
   [I-D.moriarty-post-inch-rid].  The transport described herein is
   built on the foundation of these documents; the security
   considerations contained therein are incorporated by reference.

   For transport confidentiality, identification, and authentication,
   TLS with mutual authentication MUST be used to secure the HTTP
   connection as in [RFC2818].  Each RID consortium SHOULD use a trusted
   public key infrastructure (PKI) to manage identities dor RID systems
   participating in TLS connections.  At minimum, each RID system MUST
   trust a set of X.509 Issuer identities ("Certificate Authorities") to
   authenticate RID system peers with which it is willing to exchange
   information, and/or a specific white list of X.509 Subject identities
   of RID system peers directly.

   RID systems SHOULD additionally verify the fully qualified domain
   name (FQDN) of a connected RID system peer against the presented
   Subject identity.  The fully qualified domain name used to identify a
   RID system may be stored either in a subjectAltName extension of type
   dNSName, or in the most specific Common Name field of the Subject
   identity of the RID system's X.509 certificate.  Internationalized
   FQDNs MUST be encoded using Punycode [RFC3492].  If both a Common
   Name and subjectAltName FQDN are present, the subjectAltName is to be
   given preference.


5.  IANA Considerations

   Consistent with BCP 56 [RFC3205], since RID over HTTP/TLS is a
   substantially new service, and should be controlled at the consortium
   member network's border differently than HTTP/TLS, it requires a new
   port number.  IANA has assigned port [IANA NOTE: assign port number
   here] to RID over HTTP/TLS.
