Abstract

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) was developed to provide origin
   authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital
   signatures.  These digital signatures can be generated using
   different algorithms.  Each digital signature added to a response
   increases the size of the response, which could result in the
   response message being truncated.  This draft sets out to specify a
   way for validating end-system resolvers to signal to a server which
   cryptographic algorithms they prefer in a DNSSEC response by defining
   an EDNS option to list a client's preferred algorithms.

Internet-Draft              Algorithm-Signal                   July 2009


1.  Introduction

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) was developed to provide origin
   authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital
   signatures [RFC4033], [RFC4034] and [RFC4035].  Each digital
   signature RR (RRSIG) contains an algorithm code number.  These
   algorithm codes help validators identify which cryptographic
   algorithm was used to generate the digital signature.

   RRSIG RRs can be fairly large, and increase the size of a response.
   If multiple algorithms are used, then multiple RRSIGs are returned
   for each RRset in a response.  If the response is too large, it may
   be truncated, and the client forced to resend the query using TCP.
   It would be in the client and server's interests if there was a way
   to limit the number of RRSIGs in a response to only those algorithms
   the client was interested in (if present).

   This draft sets out to specify a way for validating end-system
   resolvers to signal to a server which cryptographic algorithms they
   prefer in a DNSSEC response.  This is done using the EDNS attribute
   values in the OPT meta-RR [RFC2671].  This option could also be used
   by servers to advertise which cryptographic algorithms are used in
   signing a particular zone.

   An additional reason for having the end-system resolver signal which
   algorithms it understands is to speed the transition to a new
   algorithm.  A server will be able to determine when to start serving
   a new algorithm when it sees a sufficient number of its clients are
   able to accept the new algorithm and it will be able to determine
   when to stop serving the old algorithm when it sees that all or
   almost all of its clients are able to accept the new algorithm.
   Information about clients can also be used to communicate to the
   operators of those clients and/or the providers of their software
   that it's time to upgrade.

2.  Signaling Algorithm Understood (AU) Using EDNS

   The ENDS0 specification outlined in [RFC2671] defines a way to
   include new options using a standardized mechanism.  These options
   are contained in the RDATA of the OPT meta-RR.  This document seeks
   to define a new EDNS0 option for a client to signal which algorithms
   the client prefers, and the server to advertise which algorithms are
   used to sign a particular zone.

   Below shows how the signaling attribute is defined in the RDATA of
   the OPT RR as specified in [RFC2671]:

       0                       8                      16
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |                 OPTION-CODE (TBD)             |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |                 OPTION-LENGTH                 |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |       ALG-CODE        |        ...            \
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+


   OPTION-CODE is the code for the Algorithm Understood (AU) option.
   Its value is fixed at TBD.

   OPTION-LENGTH is the length of the data of the attribute in octets.
   DNSSEC algorithm codes are 1 octet long so this value is the number
   of octets.

   ALG-CODE is the assigned DNSSEC algorithm codes that the client
   indicates as understood.  The values MUST be in decending order, with
   the highest algorithm code first, followed by as many other codes as
   the validator wishes to signal that it understands.  For example, if
   a validating client understands RSA/SHA-1 and RSA/SHA-256 the value
   of ALG-CODE would be: 8 (RSA/SHA-256), 5 (RSA/SHA-1) indicating that
   the validator understand both RSA/SHA-256 and RSA/SHA-1, but does not
   wish to receive RRSIGs using DSA or RSA/MD5.

3.  Client Considerations

   A validating end-system resolver sets the AU option in the OPT
   meta-RR when sending a query.  The validating end-system resolver
   SHOULD set the value(s) to be the largest algorithm code that the
   validator understands (excluding Reserved codes and values greater
   than 252).  The validating end-system MAY append other algorithm
   codes that it understands and is willing to accept.

   The end-system resolver MUST also set the DNSSEC-OK bit [RFC4035] to
   indicate that it wishes to receive DNSSEC RRs in the response.

3.1.  Recommendations for Stub Clients

   Stub resolvers rely on an upstream recursive server (or cache) to
   provide a response, any algorithm preference on the stub resolver's
   side can be overruled by the upstream recursive server.  The AU EDNS
   option is NOT RECOMMENDED for non-validating stub clients.

   The only exception is for validating stub resolvers, which set the CD
   bit in queries.  In this scenario, the validating stub indicates that
   it wishes to perform its own validation and may wish to indicate
   which cryptographic algorithm it prefers.

4.  Server Considerations

   When an authoritative server sees the AU option in the OPT meta-RR in
   a request the normal algorithm for servicing requests is followed.
   The only difference is what DNSSEC RRs are included in the final
   response.

   If the AU option is present but the DNSSEC-OK bit is not set, then
   the authoritative server does not include any additional DNSSEC RRs
   in the response.  If the DNSSEC-OK bit is set, the authoritative
   server looks at the ALG-CODE values in the OPT meta-RR, selects the
   RRSIGs with the algorithm code equal one or more of the algorithm
   codes listed in the OPT RR to be included in the response (as per the
   rules in [RFC4035]).

   If the zone containing the QNAME is not signed, the authoritative
   server sends a traditional non-DNSSEC response.  If the zone
   containing the QNAME is signed with a cryptographic algorithm(s) that
   are not present in the ALG-CODE value in the client query the
   authoritative server SHOULD include any or all RRSIGs in the response
   regardless of algorithm used to generate them.

5.  Cache and Forwarder Considerations

   Caches MUST NOT set the AU option on any outgoing query from the
   cache when performing recursion on behalf of a stub client.  A cache
   MUST follow the guidelines in the DNSSEC specification ([RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035] and any updating documents).

   If a cache receives a query with the AU option set and the response
   can be answered by data out of the cache, the cache SHOULD follow the
   AU option request and only include the RRSIGs generated using the
   algorithm equal to or less than the value in ALG-CODE.

   Forwarders that do not do validation or caching SHOULD copy the AU
   option seen in received queries as they represent the wishes of the
   validating downstream resolver that issued the original query.

5.1.  Intermediate Proxy Resolvers

   Intermediate resolvers SHOULD copy the AU option seen in queries from
   end- system resolvers.  If the intermediate resolver is validating,
   it SHOULD also check for the presence of the CD bit in the query.  If

   present, the intermediate resolvers SHOULD copy the AU option as seen
   in the query.  If not or if the DNSSEC-OK bit is not set, then the
   validating intermediate resolver MAY chose to ignore the AU option in
   the query and MAY include its own preference as the AU option.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The algorithm codes used to identify DNSSEC algorithms has already
   been established by IANA.  This document does not seek to alter that
   registry in any way.

   This draft seeks to update the "DNS EDNS0 Options" registry by adding
   the AU option and referencing this document.  The code for the option
   should be TBD.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a way for a client to signal its digital
   signature algorithm preference to a cache or server.  It is not meant
   to be a discussion on algorithm superiority.  The signal is an
   optional code contained in the OPT meta-RR used with EDNS0.  The goal
   of this option is to reduce response size by having the client signal
   with digital signature algorithms it prefers and that it may not care
   about other algorithms used to sign zone data.

   It is possible that an attacker can attempt to conduct a downgrade
   attack by intercepting the query and altering the AU option code.  An
   attacker could alter the algorithm list to force the client to rely
   on a weaker digital signature algorithm even though the zone is
   signed using a stronger algorithm the client prefers.  In these cases
   a client might be able to detect an attack if the target zone has a
   DS RR in its delegating parent with the desired algorithm.  The DS
   cannot be deleted without making the parent's RRSIG over that RRset
   invalid.
