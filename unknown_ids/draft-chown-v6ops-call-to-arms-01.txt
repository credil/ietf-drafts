Abstract

   The Internet Society (ISOC) has declared that June 8th 2011 will be
   World IPv6 Day, on which organisations are being encouraged to test
   their production IPv6 deployment capability.  Many significant
   content providers and networks have stated they will take part.
   Given this date is likely to see more IPv6 traffic flowing across the
   Internet than has ever been seen before, it seems timely to issue a
   call to arms for operators and administrators to review and mitigate
   common causes of IPv6 connectivity problems.  The increased traffic
   on World IPv6 Day should also create an excellent opportunity to
   observe the behaviour and performance of IPv6; it is thus very
   desirable to have appropriate measurement tools in place in advance.
   We discuss some appropriate tools from the network and application
   perspective.

Internet-Draft         World IPv6 Day Call to Arms            March 2011


1.  Introduction

   Despite the recent exhaustion of the available IPv4 address pool,
   deployment of IPv6 remains limited.  To help encourage organisations
   to trial production deployment, ISOC has declared June 8th 2011 as
   World IPv6 Day. Organisations are encouraged to use this day to test
   IPv6 in production, either by enabling clients in their network, or
   by making externally-facing services available over IPv6.  At the
   current time, this would generally mean enabling dual-stack
   networking with IPv4 running alongside IPv6.  However, IPv6-only
   networks are inevitable, and so some sites may choose to use June 8th
   to undertake some focused tests on that deployment model.

   The purpose of this document is two-fold.  One is to discuss common
   IPv6 connecivity issues that are likely to arise on June 8th, with a
   focus on dual-stack networking (which is likely to be how the vast
   majority of sites take part).  This should help raise awareness of
   those problems and possible mitigations.  The other is to encourage
   organisations to think about how they might get useful
   instrumentation on what happens in and to/from their networks on the
   day.  Such measurement tools are likely to also be useful longer term
   - once deployed they could be left in place.

   For most sites providing content, June 8th will be a chance to make
   some public facing services available over IPv6, such as web content
   using their production domain (e.g. www.example.com) rather than a
   contrived IPv6 test domain (e.g. www.ipv6.example.com).  But also
   some enterprise sites may choose to enable IPv6 in user/client
   subnets, in which case the performance of those systems and the
   applications they run will be of paramount interest.

   The document also includes a brief section on tools that might be
   used to test IPv6-only operation.

   NB.  This is a very rough draft of the document; feedback is
   welcomed.  The scope of the document is purely informational to
   provoke discussion, and to encourage deployment steps for June 8th,
   which may remain in place after that date.  We aim to have a
   relatively mature informational text ready well in advance of June.


2.  Connectivity Issues

   In this section we review some common causes of IPv6 connectivity
   issues.  The topics below include initial thoughts for this early
   draft, and there is no significance to the order in which issues are
   listed.  Some issues, such as transit arrangements, are not included
   - currently the focus is on end sites (or users) who may take part in

Internet-Draft         World IPv6 Day Call to Arms            March 2011


   the World IPv6 Day.

2.1.  Unmanaged Tunnels

   One cause of connectivity problems is the use of unmanaged tunnels,
   in particular 'automated' methods that are not provisioned by the
   user's ISP.  The most common example is 6to4 [RFC3056], or more
   specifically the 6to4 relay approach described in [RFC3068].  A
   native IPv6 host communicating with a 6to4 host will require both
   hosts to have access to an appropriately capable 6to4 relay (which
   may or may not be the same relay).  If a host in a native IPv6
   network has no route to 2002::/16 it cannot send traffic to a 6to4
   host.  Similarly, a 6to4 router that cannot reach the well-known IPv4
   anycast relay address cannot send traffic to a native IPv6 network.

   One approach to this problem is to encourage sites/ISPs to run local
   relays, as discussed in [I-D.carpenter-v6ops-6to4-teredo-advisory].
   The alternative to reduce such problems is simply to obsolete 6to4,
   as proposed in [I-D.troan-v6ops-6to4-to-historic].

2.2.  Tunnel Broker first-hop delays

   IPv6 tunnel brokers, such as those provided by SixXS
   (http://www.sixxs.net) and Hurricane Electric
   (http://tunnelbroker.net) provide a more robust, managed approach to
   IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnelled access than 6to4.  Individual users interested
   in IPv6 access for World IPv6 Day, in the absence of IPv6 support
   from their ISP, should consider registering to use a free tunnel
   broker.  When choosing a broker service, it is prudent to pick one
   with a presence near to you that has a minimal round trip time.
   Providers such as SixXS and HE have tunnel broker servers in many
   countries.  Beware picking a broker in another continent that may add
   150ms+ to your round trip times.

2.3.  Connection Timeouts

   Where dual-stack systems - or rather the applications running on them
   - have a choice of IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity, timeouts can occur if
   there is no connectivity on the preferred protocol.  For example, if
   both A and AAAA DNS records exists for a web server, and IPv6
   connectivity is broken, there is likely to be some timeout for the
   browser before the connection drops back to IPv4.

   A bigger problem exists if the application or OS tries IPv6 first and
   then does not fall back to IPv4.  A bug in versions of Opera prior to
   10.5 caused such behaviour, which was obviously a big issue for Opera
   users trying to access dual-stack web sites with broken IPv6
   connectivity.

Internet-Draft         World IPv6 Day Call to Arms            March 2011


   The author has undertaken some informal tests at his own site, which
   shows how different operating systems handle ICMP unreachables, if
   they are received.  On Linux, web connections timeout after 20
   seconds for 'no response', but immediately for unreachables.  In
   contrast, Windows Vista was 20 seconds regardless of unreachables
   being received.  Any non-trivial delay will cause significant user
   frustration.

   This problem is probably the main reason that Google implemented a
   AAAA whitelisting system for its test sites.  The sites had to
   demonstrate they had good IPv6 connectivity before being allowed into
   the test programme.  The topic is discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-v6-aaaa-whitelisting-implications].  For the sake of
   World IPv6 Day, it is expected that no such whitelisting is in place
   - that is, after all, the point of having a day dedicated to testing
   IPv6 in production.

   An interesting suggestion to handle the problem is the 'happy
   eyeballs' approach described in [I-D.ietf-v6ops-happy-eyeballs].
   This approach is now also being suggested for multiple interface
   systems, as per [I-D.chen-mif-happy-eyeballs-extension].  However
   some people feel this 'workaround' is simply masking underlying
   problems that should be fixed.

2.4.  PMTU Discovery

   IPv6 mandates that fragmentation is only undertaken by the sending
   node, and thus IPv6 requires working PMTU Discovery [RFC1981].  An
   existing RFC gives Recommendations for Filtering ICMPv6 Messages in
   Firewalls [RFC4890]; if this guidance is not followed, connectivity
   problems are likely to arise.  Blindly filtering all ICMPv6 messages
   is not good practise.

   The minimum MTU for IPv6 is 1280 bytes.  Where PMTUD is not working
   or not implemented, the minimum MTU should be used.

2.5.  Rogue Router Advertisements

   Within a site, hosts may use IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   (SLAAC) [RFC4862].  However, it is possible for accidental (or
   malicious) rogue RAs to cause connectivity issues, as described in
   the Rogue Router Advertisement Problem Statement [RFC6104].

   A typical cause of rogue RAs is Windows ICS, which can present a
   rogue 6to4 router on its wireless interface.  This will cause hosts
   to potentially autoconfigure two global IPv6 addresses and pick the
   wrong default router, with unpredictable results.  As a (bad) example
   the author experienced a scenario where he had a rogue 6to4 RA, but



Chown & Venaas         Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         World IPv6 Day Call to Arms            March 2011


   because the rogue 6to4 was working he was able to access IPv6
   networks outside his own network, but could not access most internal
   hosts inside his own network because he was unwittingly using 6to4
   from outside into his own network, and thus being firewalled from
   those internal hosts.

   In many cases, default address selection [RFC3484] (and
   [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484-revise]) would avoid such cases, because the
   address selection rules should prefer, or can be configured to
   prefer, native IPv6 over 6to4.  However not all operating systems
   implement RFC 3484 yet, in particular MacOS X.

   Adding ACLs to your switches to block ICMPv6 Type 134 packets on
   ports that do not have routers connected would also minimise rogue
   RAs.  A more elegant solution is RA Guard [RFC6105], and another is
   use of SEcure Neighbour Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971].  However neither
   is widely implemented yet.  Indeed, any reported operational
   experience of SEND in an enterprise network would be very welcome.

   Finally, there is a tool called RAmond, available freely from
   http://ramond.sourceforge.net, that can be configured to detect and
   issue deprecating RAs against observed rogue RAs.  This software is
   based on rafixd.

2.6.  Tunnel performance

   In scenarios where sites currently have manually configured tunnels
   to gain IPv6 connectivity, it may be the case that such encapsulation
   is performed by a router's CPU, in which case unexpected high volumes
   of traffic may cause problems.  Bear in mind that on World IPv6 Day,
   you may start using IPv6 by default for some high bandwidth
   applications that you had not used before, e.g.  YouTube from Google.

2.7.  AAAA record advertised but service not enabled

   If enabling a service for World IPv6 Day, be aware of other existing
   services that may be running on the same system.  If a server has
   multiple functions, all services should be IPv6 enabled before a AAAA
   record is entered into the DNS for services that may use that name.

   A related consideration is to make sure that firewalls don't just
   drop IPv6 packets to ports that are not in use.  It's better if the
   firewall or host sends a TCP RST to avoid a potential timeout.  For
   example, if you add a AAAA record for your web server that also runs
   say FTP, where FTP is IPv4 only, either the firewall should have port
   21 open or the firewall should be configured to send a TCP RST.

3.  Instrumentation

   In this section we discuss potential instrumentation approaches that
   may be configured for World IPv6 Day, and then retained longer term
   after the event.  These should complement informal, subjective
   reports from users at participating sites.  It is probably prudent to
   make users aware of the 'at risk' day, and actions they should take
   should the experience problems.  It may also be desirable to
   undertake some form of user survey soon afterwards.

3.1.  IPv6 traffic levels

   It should be possible to measure raw IPv6 traffic levels
   independently on dual-stack switch/router platforms, given
   implementations of appropriate MIBs.  Sites should take steps to
   ensure they have the tools in place to be able to view the relative
   levels of IPv4 and IPv6 traffic over time.

   Application level measurement is also desirable, because handling of
   choice (preference) of protocol used lies with the application if
   both A and AAAA records are returned.  Sites should be aware that due
   to IPv6 Privacy Extensions [RFC4941] application logs may show more
   apparent different clients connecting, due to clients cycling the
   source IPv6 address they use over time.

3.2.  Network flow records

   Where available, sites should seek to deploy network flow records for
   traffic, to maximise opportunities to analyse traffic patterns after
   the event, or in the case of reports of specific problems.  Netflow
   v9 supports IPv6.  Open source IPv6-capable Netflow collectors also
   exist, e.g. nfsen, from http://nfsen.sourceforge.net.

3.3.  Client Web Access Success Rate

   There have been some recent studies on the capabilities of web
   clients to access content on dual-stack servers by IPv4 or IPv6 in
   the presence of both A and AAAA records existing for a web domain.

   One good example is that of [Anderson10], as reported at RIPE-61,
   where the author set up some application (web server) oriented tests
   for his newspaper content in Norway.  The methodology was to add an
   invisible IFRAME to his site that would include IMG links randomly to
   1x1 images that were served either via an IPv4-only target or a dual-
   stack target.  Variation in the hit rates would imply IPv6
   brokenness.  By analysing the http metadata information could be
   gleaned on the cause of the brokenness.  Results in Q4'2009 showed
   0.2-0.3% brokenness, including the Opera bug mentioned above.

Internet-Draft         World IPv6 Day Call to Arms            March 2011


   Recent figures published by Google suggest at most a 0.1% level of
   brokenness, indicating some improvement, but that level is still
   potentially 1 in 1000 users with a problem.  Sites may wish to make
   their own measurements of IPv6 brokenness rather than relying on
   third party reports.

3.4.  IPv4 Performance Comparison

   Where a dual-stack service is deployed, measuring the relative
   performance of both protocols is desirable.  This may primarily be a
   measurement of throughput or delay, but may also include
   availability/uptime measurement.  A site may choose to set up its own
   performance measuring framework, for example using open source
   bandwidth and throughput test tools.

3.5.  Security monitoring

   We mentioned RAmond above in the context of watching for rogue RAs.
   There is another useful package called NDPmon, also available freely
   from http://ndpmon.sourceforge.net, that can be configured to watch
   for certain types of IPv6 'abuse' on your local network.  It may be
   interesting to run the tool to confirm whether any 'bad' traffic is
   observed within your network on World IPv6 Day.


4.  IPv6-only testing

   The long-term IPv6 deployment plan is IPv6-only networking, rather
   than dual-stack.  It is not clear how quickly significant IPv6-only
   networks will emerge, but testing of approaches to IPv6-only
   operation is desirable as soon as possible.

   Some experience of NAT64 [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] has
   been described in [I-D.tan-v6ops-nat64-experiences], though this
   appears to have used only NAT-PT so far.  An implementation of NAT64
   is available at http://ecdysis.viagenie.ca.  Operational experience
   of IVI is also desirable.  An implementation of IVI is available at
   http://www.ivi2.org/IVI.


5.  Conclusions

   With the ISOC World IPv6 Day event due on June 8th 2011, this
   document aims to help focus attention on both improving awareness and
   mitigations of common causes of IPv6 connectivity problems, and
   encouraging sites and organisations to introduce appropriate
   instrumentation into their networks so they can observe traffic
   behaviour appropriately.
