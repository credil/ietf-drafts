                    A Registry for Mail Trace Fields
                 draft-levine-trace-header-registry-00

Abstract

   SMTP mail software adds trace header fields to messages as they pass
   through the mail system.  This document updates the definition of
   trace header fields, and adds trace field information to the
   registries for Permanent Message Header Fields and Provisional
   Message Header Fields.

1.  Introduction

Internet-Draft            Trace Field Registry              January 2012


   Sections 3.6.6 and 3.6.7 of [RFC5322] define Resent Fields and Trace
   Fields, respectively.  These are header fields that are prepended to
   the message as it moves through the SMTP mail infrastructure.
   Although [RFC5322] defines only two fields, Return-Path: and
   Received: as Trace Fields, in practice there are many other header
   fields that act as trace fields.  This document updates the
   definition of trace fields, and adds a new column to the IANA
   registries of header fields to document which ones are trace fields.

   In some documents, Trace Fields are referred to as Trace Header
   Fields.  The two terms are synonyms.  This document uses the shorter
   term Trace Fields.

2.  Definitions

   This section defines various terms used throughout this document.

2.1.  General

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Email Specific

   [RFC5598] introduces several terms and concepts that are used in this
   memo, and thus readers are advised to become familiar with it as
   well.  Specifically, this document uses the terms Mail Transfer Agent
   (MTA), Mail User Agent (MUA), Mail Delivery Agent (MDA), and Mail
   Submission Agent (MSA).

3.  Trace Fields

   The definition of Trace Fields in RFC 5322 is updated to include all
   of the header fields identified as Trace Fields in the IANA Permanent
   Message Header Fields and Provisional Message Header Fields
   registries.  The initial set of Trace Fields for those registries is
   listed in [ianainit].

3.1.  Usage of Trace Fields

   Whenever a component adds a Trace Field to a message, it MUST add the
   field at the top of the message.  Components MAY delete existing
   Trace Fields, but they MUST NOT reorder them.  Unlike most other
   header fields, it is usually not an error to have multiple
   occurrences of the same Trace Field.  Of the fields described in this
   document, all but Return-Path: can occur multiple times.

   Trace Fields are intended to document the progress of a message
   through the e-mail system.  The sequence of Trace Fields at the top
   of the message describes that progress in reverse chronological
   order.

4.  IANA Considerations

Internet-Draft            Trace Field Registry              January 2012


   IANA is requested to update the Permanent Message Header Fields and
   Provisional Message Header Fields registries, defined in [RFC3864] to
   include a new column called Trace Field.  For each Header Field, this
   column may be blank, in which case the header field is not a Trace
   Field, or any of the tokens MTA, MUA, MSA, or MDA, to indicate that
   the header field is a Trace Field, and what component typically adds
   the header to a message.  Note that the distinction among non-blank
   tokens is not normative, and a trace field MAY be added by any
   component that handles a message.

   The registration templates described in sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 of
   [RFC3864] are each updated to add a new section:

   Trace Field: Specify: blank, "MTA", "MUA", "MSA", or "MDA".  If this
      field is not an e-mail Trace Field, this section is left blank.
      If it is a Trace Field, the component that typically adds the
      field.

4.1.  Initial set of Trace Fields

   In the table below, the first column describes an existing Header
   Field, and the second column is the value to put in its Trace Field.
   The third column is for documentation, and is intended to match the
   existing contents of the Reference column in the registries.  For all
   headers not in this list, the initial value of the Trace Field is
   blank.

         +-------------------------+-------------+-----------+
         | Header Field Name       | Trace Field | Reference |
         +-------------------------+-------------+-----------+
         | Authentication-Results: | MTA         | [RFC5451] |
         | Auto-Submitted:         | MSA         | [RFC5436] |
         | DKIM-Signature:         | MSA         | [RFC6376] |
         | Received:               | MTA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Received-SPF:           | MTA         | [RFC4408] |
         | Resent-Date:            | MUA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Resent-From:            | MUA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Resent-Sender:          | MUA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Resent-To:              | MUA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Resent-Cc:              | MUA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Resent-Bcc:             | MUA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Resent-Message-ID:      | MUA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Return-Path:            | MDA         | [RFC5322] |
         | VBR-Info:               | MSA         | [RFC5518] |
         +-------------------------+-------------+-----------+

   Note: The Permanent Message Header Field Names registry currently
   lists [RFC3834] as the reference for the Auto-Submitted: field, but
   there is a later and more detailed description of it in [RFC5436]
   that describes it as a trace field.
