Internet-Draft               RFC3484 Revise                 October 2010


1.  Introduction

   RFC 3484 describes algorithms for source address selection and for
   destination address selection.  The algorithms specify default
   behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations.

   RFC 3484 has several known issues to be fixed.  Deprecation of IPv6
   site-local unicast address and the coming of ULA brought some
   preferable changes to the rules.  Additionally, the rule 9 of the
   destination address selection rules, namely the longest matching
   rule, is known for its adverse effect on the round robin DNS
   technique.

   This document specifies a set of updates that modify the algorithms
   and fix the known defects.


2.  Specification

2.1.  Changes related to the default policy table

   The default policy table is defined in RFC 3484 Section 2.1 as
   follows:

         Prefix        Precedence Label
         ::1/128               50     0
         ::/0                  40     1
         2002::/16             30     2
         ::/96                 20     3
         ::ffff:0:0/96         10     4

   The changes that should be included into the default policy table are
   those rules that are universally useful and do no harm in every
   reasonable network envionment.  The changes we should consider for
   the default policy table are listed in this sub-section.

   The policy table is defined to be configurable.  The changes that are
   useful not universally but locally can be put into the policy table
   manually or by using the auto-configuration mechanism proposed as a
   DHCP option [I-D.fujisaki-dhc-addr-select-opt].

2.1.1.  ULA in the policy table

   RFC 5220 Section 2.1.4, 2.2.2, and 2.2.3 describes address selection
   problems related to ULA.  These problems can be solved by changing
   the scope of ULA to site-local, and/or by adding an entry for default
   policy table entry that has its own label for ULA.




Matsumoto, et al.        Expires April 18, 2011                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               RFC3484 Revise                 October 2010


   In its nature, ULA has global scope.  This is because ULA's scope is
   expected to be defined in routing system.  It may be the case that
   ULA and global IPv6 address are used for source and destination
   addresses of communication.

   On the other hand, to prioritize ULA to ULA communication is
   basically reasonable.  ULA should not be exposed to outside of its
   routable routing domain, so if ULA is given from the application as a
   candidate destination address, it can be generally expected that the
   ULA is within or at least close to the source host.

   Therefore, the scope of ULA should be kept global, and prioritization
   of ULA to ULA communication should be implemented in policy table, by
   assigning its own label for ULA fc00::/7.

2.1.2.  Teredo in the policy table

   Teredo [RFC4380] is defined and has been assigned 2001::/32.  This
   address block should be assigned its own label in the policy table.
   Teredo's priority should be less or equal to 6to4, considering its
   characteristic of transitional tunnel mechanism.  About Windows, this
   is already in the implementation.

2.1.3.  Deprecated addresses in the policy table

   IPv4-compatible IPv6 address is deprecated.  [RFC4291] IPv6 site-
   local unicast address is deprecated.  [RFC3879] Moreover, 6bone
   testing address was [RFC3701] The issue is how we treat these
   outdated addresses.

2.1.4.  Renewed default policy table

   After applying these updates, the default policy table will be:

         Prefix        Precedence Label
         ::1/128               60     0
         fc00::/7              50     1
         ::/0                  40     2
         ::ffff:0:0/96         30     3
         2002::/16             20     4
         2001::/32             10     5
         ::/96                  1    10
         fec::/16               1    11
         3ffe::/16              1    12

2.2.  The longest matching rule

   This issue is related to the longest matching rule, which was found
   by Dave Thaler.  It is malfunction of DNS round robin technique.  It
   is common for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   When a destination address DA, DB, and the source address of DA
   Source(DA) are on the same subnet and Source(DA) == Source(DB), DNS
   round robin load-balancing cannot function.  By considering prefix
   lengths that are longer than the subnet prefix, this rule establishes
   preference between addresses that have no substantive differences
   between them.  The rule functions as an arbitrary tie-breaker between
   the hosts in a round robin, causing a given host to always prefer a
   given member of the round robin.

   By limiting the calculation of common prefixes to a maximum length
   equal to the length of the subnet prefix of the source address, rule
   9 can continue to favor hosts that are nearby in the network
   hierarchy without arbitrarily sorting addresses within a given
   network.  This modification could be written as follows:

   Rule 9: Use longest matching prefix.

   When DA and DB belong to the same address family (both are IPv6 or
   both are IPv4): If CommonPrefixLen(DA & Netmask(Source(DA)),
   Source(DA)) > CommonPrefixLen(DB & Netmask(Source(DB)), Source(DB)),
   then prefer DA.  Similarly, if CommonPrefixLen(DA &
   Netmask(Source(DA)), Source(DA)) < CommonPrefixLen(DB &
   Netmask(Source(DB)), Source(DB)), then prefer DB.

2.3.  Private IPv4 address scope

   As detailed in Remi's draft [I-D.denis-v6ops-nat-addrsel], when a
   host is in NATed site, and has a private IPv4 address and
   transitional addresses like 6to4 and Teredo, the host chooses
   transitional IPv6 address to access most of the dual-stack servers.

   This is because private IPv4 address is defined to be site-local
   scope, and as in RFC 3484, the scope matching rules (Rule 2) set
   lower priority for private IPv4 address.

   By changing the address scope of private IPv4 address to global, this
   problem can be solved.  Considering the widely deployed NAT with IPv4
   private address model, this change works in most of the cases.  If
   not, this behavior can be overridden by configuring policy table, or
   by configuring routing table on a host.

   Moreover, some modern OSs have already implemented this change.

2.4.  Deprecation of site-local unicast address

   RFC3484 contains a few "site-local unicast" and "fec::" description.
   It's better to remove examples related to site-local unicast address,
   or change examples to use ULA.  Possible points to be re-written are
   below.
      - 2nd paragraph in RFC 3484 Section 3.1 describes scope comparison
      mechanism.
      - RFC 3484 Section 10 contains examples for site-local address.


3.  Security Considerations

   No security risk is found that degrades RFC 3484.


4.  IANA Considerations

   Address type number for the policy table may have to be assigned by
   IANA.

Appendix B.  Discussion

B.1.  Centrally assigned ULA

   Discussion:  Centrally assigned ULA [I-D.ietf-ipv6-ula-central] is
      proposed, and assigned fc00::/8.  Using the different labels for
      fc00::/8 and fd00::/8 makes sense if we can assume the same kind
      of address block is assigned in the same or adjacent network.

Internet-Draft               RFC3484 Revise                 October 2010


      However, the way of assignment and network adjancency may not have
      any relationships.

B.2.  6to4, Teredo, and IPv4 prioritization

   Discussion:  Regarding the prioritization between IPv4 and these
      transitional mechanisms, the connectivity of them are recently
      known to be worse than IPv4.  These mechiansms are said to be the
      last resort access to IPv6 resources.  While 6to4 should have
      higher precedence over Teredo, in that 6to4 host to 6to4 host
      communication can be over IPv4, which can result in more optimal
      path, and 6to4 does not need NAT traversal.

B.3.  Deprecated address

   Discussion:  These addresses was removed from the current
      specification.  So, it should not be treated differently,
      especially if we think about future re-use of these address
      blocks.

      Considering the inappropriate use of these address blocks
      especially in outdated implementations and bad effects brought by
      them, however, it should be labeled differently from the
      legitimate address blocks.
      keep this entry for the sake of backward compatibility ?

B.4.  The longest match rule

   RFC 3484 defines that the destination address selection rule 9 should
   be applied to both IPv4 and IPv6, which spoils the DNS based load
   balancing technique that is widely used in the IPv4 Internet today.

   When two or more destination addresses are acquired from one FQDN,
   the rule 9 defines that the longest matching destination and source
   address pair should be chosen.  As in RFC 1794, the DNS based load
   balancing technique is achived by not re-ordering the destination
   addresses returned from the DNS server.  The Rule 9 defines
   deterministic rule for re-ordering at hosts, hence the technique of
   RFC 1794 is not available anymore.

   Regarding this problem, there was discussion in IETF and other places
   like below.

   Discussion: The possible changes to RFC 3484 are as follows:
   1.  To delete Rule 9 completely.
   2.  To apply Rule 9 only for IPv6 and not for IPv4.  In IPv6,
       hiearchical address assignment is general principle, hence the
       longest matchin rule is beneficial in many cases.  In IPv4, as



Matsumoto, et al.        Expires April 18, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               RFC3484 Revise                 October 2010


       stated above, the DNS based load balancing technique is widely
       used.
   3.  To apply Rule 9 for IPv6 conditionally and not for IPv4.  When
       the length of matching bits of the destination address and the
       source address is longer than N, the rule 9 is applied.
       Otherwise, the order of the destination addresses do not change.
       The N should be configurable and it should be 32 by default.
       This is simply because the two sites whose matching bit length is
       longer than 32 are probably adjacent.

   Now that IPv6 PI address is admitted in some RIRs, hierachical
   address assignment is not maintained anymore.  It seems that the
   longest matching algorithm may not worth the adverse effect of
   disalbing the DNS based load balance technique.
