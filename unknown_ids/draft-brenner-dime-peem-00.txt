Abstract

   This document describes the Diameter protocol application used for
   invocation of Policy Processing (Policy Evaluation, or Evaluation and
   Enforcement).  This application is needed as one of the
   implementations of the Open Mobile Aliance (OMA) Policy Evaluation,
   Enforcement and Management (PEEM) enabler, namely for the PEM-1
   interface used to send a request/responses for Policy Processing.
   When combined with the Diameter Base protocol, this application

   specification satisfies the OMA PEEM requirements for sending a
   request for policy processing and receiving a response with the
   policy processing result.

   Diameter Base protocol, as per RFC 3588, and extends it only for the

   ID, a new Command Code, and a new AVP defined in the vendor-specific
   namespace.  Input to policy processing are being passed through a new
   AVP, and policy results are being passed through a combination of the
   same new AVP, and the Experimental-Result AVP.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the Diameter protocol application used for
   invocation of Policy Processing for resources in a Service Provider's
   environment.  When combined with the Diameter Base protocol, this
   application specification satisfies the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)
   Policy Evaluation, Enforcement and Management (PEEM) requirements
   [PEEM-RD] for sending a request for policy processing and receiving a
   response with the policy processing result.

   The Diameter realization of this application assumes the use of
   Diameter Base protocol, as per RFC 3588, and extends it only for with
   a specific application using a vendor-id, a vendor-specific
   application ID, a new Command Code, and a new AVP defined in the
   vendor-specific namespace.  Input to policy processing are being
   passed through a new AVP, and policy results are being passed through
   a combination of the same new AVP, and the Experimental-Result AVP.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The base Diameter specification [RFC3588] Section 1.4 defines most of
   the terminology used in this document.  Additionally, the terms and
   acronyms defined in [PEEM-AD] and [PEM-1-TS] are used in this
   document.



3.  Diameter Policy Processing Application

   A detailed description of the Diameter Policy Processing Application
   can be found in Section 5.4.1 of the Policy Evaluation, Enforcement
   and Management Callable Interface (PEM-1) Technical Specification
   [PEM-1-TS].


4.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the Diameter Policy Processing Application.
   It builds on top of the Diameter Base protocol and the same security
   considerations described in RFC 3588 [RFC3588] are applicable to this
   document.  No further extensions are required beyond the security

   mechanisms offered by RFC 3588.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
   Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC2434].

   This document defines values in the namespaces that have been created
   and defined in the Diameter Base [RFC3588].  The IANA Considerations
   section of that document details the assignment criteria.  Values
   assigned in this document, or by future IANA action, must be
   coordinated within this shared namespace.

5.1.  Command Codes

   This specification assigns the value TBD-Cmd-code from the Command
   Code namespace defined in [RFC3588].  See Section 5.4.1.3.1 of
   [PEM-1-TS] for the assignment of the TBD-Cmd-code.

5.2.  AVP Codes

   This specification assigns the value TBD-AVP-Code for the Policy-Data
   AVP, in the OMA Vendor-ID (PEN) AVP namespace.  See Section 5.4.1.3.3
   of [PEM-1-TS] for the assignment of the namespace in this
   specification.

5.3.  Application Identifier

   This specification uses the value 16777243 in the Application
   Identifier namespace as registered in IANA for the Policy Processing
   Application.  See Section 5.4.1.3 of [PEM-1-TS] for more information.


6.  Acknowledgements

   The author would like to thank Dan Romascanu and Hannes Tschofenig
   for their help and support.

   Finally, the author would like to thank Alcatel-Lucent, as most of
   the effort put into this document was done while he was in their
   employ.
