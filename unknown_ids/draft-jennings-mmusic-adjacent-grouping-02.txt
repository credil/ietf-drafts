     Grouping of Adjacent Media in the Session Description Protocol
               draft-jennings-mmusic-adjacent-grouping-02

Abstract

   Applications such as multi-screen video conferencing systems or
   advertisement boards often have multiple audio and video streams that
   are organized to be rendered side by side or in a grid.  This
   specification uses the RFC 5888 grouping framework to define new
   semantics for grouping the media streams to be rendered side by side
   or in a grid and indicating their relative ordering.

Internet-Draft       Adjacent Media Grouping in SDP         October 2010


1.  Introduction

   There are many situations where applications create media streams
   that are meant do be rendered adjacent to each other.  A common
   example is a multi-screen video conferencing system.  Other examples
   are several video monitors placed side by side to display signs, and
   audio streams from a linear array of microphones, or a grid of
   display for monitoring security cameras.  The Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] allows negotiation of multiple media streams
   but does not have a way to carry the ordering information to indicate
   which media stream is adjacent to which one.

   This specification introduces new grouping semantics, using the SDP
   grouping framework defined in [RFC5888], that indicate media streams
   are adjacent, and the adjacency order is defined by the order of the
   entries in the group.


2.  Terminology

   This specification uses all the terms defined in [RFC5888] and will
   not make sense unless you have read [RFC5888].  The key words "MUST",
   "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" in this specification
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Adjacent Media Grouping

3.1.  "ADJ" Grouping Semantics

   This specification defines new grouping semantics of "ADJ" that
   indicate the media streams in this group are meant to be played or
   displayed adjacently.  Furthermore, the order of media streams in the
   group indicates the adjacency order.  This only indicates the order
   the device sending the SDP believes is the preferred way to display
   the media described in this SDP.  This is a declarative SDP parameter
   and is not negotiated.

   N media streams could be in a linear horizontal layout, in which case
   we use a grid size of 1 x N. Alternatively, N media streams could be
   in a linear vertical layout, in which case we use a grid size of N x
   1.  In these configurations, the first stream in the group MUST be
   the one corresponding to the left most and top most output unit,
   respectively.  In a more general grid size of N x M, we can group K
   (where K <= N x M) media streams starting from the one corresponding
   to the top-left output unit, and then doing a continuous horizontal
   scanning of the grid row by row (i.e., scanning first the top row
   from left to right, and then the second row from left to right, and

   so on).  When we say leftmost, we mean from the point of view of the
   person looking at the display.

   To indicate the dimensions of the layout grid in SDP, we define a new
   session-level attribute.  The syntax for the new attribute in ABNF
   [RFC5234] is as follows:


        media-grid-dims-line = "a=media-grid-dims:" row "x" column CRLF

        row    = %x31-39 *DIGIT
        column = %x31-39 *DIGIT


   The parameters "row" and "column" indicate the number of rows and
   columns for this media grid.  They both MUST be an integer larger
   than zero.

   If the "media-grid-dims" attribute does not exist in the SDP, then a
   1 x N horizontal linear layout MUST be assumed.

   Open Issue:  I think this should be a session-level attribute,
   however what if I wanna define two grids?  Maybe put an identifier
   field?

   Per [RFC5888], there MAY be more than one adjacent media group in a
   single SDP session.

   Editor's note:  Should we use "output unit" or "input unit" here?

   Open Issue:  What if the offerer wants to send 32 streams in a grid
   size of 64?  Consider that he wants to send a separate video to each
   white-colored unit in a chessboard-like grid (skipping the black-
   colored units)?  These streams are still adjacent but they have a
   "space" in between them.  Does he need to define empty m lines for
   the black-colored units?  Or should we maybe define an optional
   "bitmap" parameter for the media-grid-dims attribute?  E.g.,
   bitmap=101010 will indicate that I have 3 active streams and one
   empty screen between each.  Given the use cases, it seems best to go
   with the simplest solution and just not support this type of variable
   spaced layout.

3.2.  Grouping for SSRC-Multiplexed RTP Streams

   Editor's note:  We should also define the grouping semantics for SSRC
   multiplexed streams (i.e., a=ssrc-group:ADJ) as in [RFC5576].

3.3.  SDP Offer/Answer Model Considerations

   When offering adjacent media grouping using SDP in an Offer/Answer
   model [RFC3264], the following considerations apply.

   A node that is receiving an offer from a sender may or may not
   understand line grouping.  It is also possible that the node
   understands line grouping but it does not understand the "ADJ"
   semantics.  From the viewpoint of the sender of the offer, these
   cases are indistinguishable.

   When a node is offered a session with the "ADJ" grouping semantics
   but it does not support line grouping or the adjacent media grouping
   semantics, as per [RFC5888], the node responds to the offer either
   (1) with an answer that ignores the grouping attribute or (2) with a
   refusal to the request (e.g., 488 Not Acceptable Here or 606 Not
   Acceptable in SIP).

   In the first case, the original sender of the offer must send a new
   offer without any grouping.  In the second case, if the sender of the
   offer still wishes to establish the session, it should retry the
   request with an offer without the adjacent media grouping.  This
   behavior is specified in [RFC5888].

   The SIP offer MUST contain the sender's desired layout.  The answer
   MAY contain the desired layout of the streams that the system sending
   the answer will be sending to the system that sent the offer.

   Editor's note:  Does it have to be a SIP offer/answer?  Or should we
   rather just say "offer/answer"?


4.  SDP Examples

   This section provides SDP examples showing how to use the adjacent
   media grouping.

4.1.  Horizontal Layout

   A video conferencing system with three screens and six audio channels
   sends a SIP offer to a video conferencing system with two screens
   that support stereo audio.  The following figure shows a top-down
   view of the room with the three screen system that is sending the SIP
   offer.  Screen A is the left most screen for the user in this room
   but should be displayed as the rightmost screen for the user at the
   far end that will be viewing the video.  The M1 to M6 indicate the
   placement of the audio microphones for the six streams of audio.

     Screen A      Screen B     Screen C
   [----------][------------][------------]
    M1      M2  M3        M4  M5        M6


                    User


   Assume the SDP mid values for the screens are sa, sb, and sc, for
   Screens A through C respectively, and the audio streams have mid
   values m1 through m6.  The offer contains the following in the SDP:
      a=group:ADJ sc sb sa
      a=group:ADJ m6 m5 m4 m3 m2 m1

   There might be other media streams, such as presentation video, that
   are not part of any "ADJ" group.

   As a note to implementors, consider the case where each screen had
   two media flows that were in the same FID group.  In this case all
   the media streams are still listed in the ADJ group and the order of
   two streams in the same FID group can be arbitrarily picked as they
   will be displayed on the same device.

   TBD - Put in full SDP for examples.

4.2.  Grid Layout

   A system if providing 15 video streams to a wall of screens.  The
   wall has 3 columns and 2 rows of screens.

   TBD


5.  Security Considerations

   Like all SDP, integrity of this information is important.  When
   carrying SDP in SIP, mechanisms such as Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) can provide hop by hop confidentiality and integrity.  The
   receiver SHOULD do an integrity check on SDP and follow the security
   considerations of SDP [RFC4566] to trust only SDP from trusted
   sources.  End-to-end integrity can be provided by [RFC4474].


6.  IANA Considerations

   Note to RFC Editor:  Please replace [RFC-AAAA] with the RFC number
   for this specification.
