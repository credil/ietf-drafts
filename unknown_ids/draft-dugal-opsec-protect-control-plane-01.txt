                  Protecting The Router Control Plane
             draft-dugal-opsec-protect-control-plane-01.txt

Abstract

   This memo provides a method for protecting a router's control plane
   from undesired or malicious traffic.  In this approach, all
   legitimate control plane traffic is identifed.  Once legitimate
   traffic has been identified, a filter is deployed on the router's
   forwarding plane.  That filter prevents traffic not specifically
   identified as legitimate from reaching the router's control plane.

1.  Introduction

   Modern core router architecture design maintains a strict separation
   of forwarding and control plane hardware and software.  Forwarding
   plane is typically described as router architecture hardware and
   software components responsible for taking a packet coming in one
   interface, performing a lookup to identify the packet's IP next hop
   and determine the outgoing interface towards the destination, and
   forwarding the packet through the correct outgoing interface.
   Control plane supports routing and management functions, and is
   generally described as as router architecture hardware and software
   components for handling packets destined to the device itself as well
   as building and sending packets originated locally on the device.

   Visually it can be represented as the control plane hardware sitting
   on top of and interfacing with the forwarding plane hardware, with
   interfaces connecting to other network devices.  See Figure 1.

   Typically, forwarding plane functionality is realized in high-
   performance Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that are
   capable of handling very high packet rates.  By contrast, the control
   plane is generally realized in software on general purpose
   processors.  While software instructions run on both planes, the
   control plane software is usually not optimized for high speed packet
   handling.  Given their differences in packet handling capabilities,
   control plane hardware is more suceptible to be overwhelmed by a DoS
   attack than forwarding plane ASICs.  It is imperative that the
   control plane remain stable regardless of traffic load to and from
   the device because the control plane is what drives the programming
   of the forwarding plane.

   The control plane processes traffic destined to the router, and
   because of the wider range of functionality is more suceptible to
   security vulnerabilities and a more likely target for a DoS attack

   than the forwarding plane.

   It is advisable to protect the control plane by implementing
   mechanisms to filter completely or rate limit traffic not required at
   the control plane level (i.e., unwanted traffic).  Control Plane
   Protection is the concept of filtering traffic unwanted traffic which
   would be diverted out of the forwarding plane up to the control
   plane.  The closer to the forwarding plane and line-rate hardware the
   filters and rate-limiters are, the more effective the protection is
   and the more resistent the system is to DoS attacks.  This memo
   demonstrates how to deploy such a filter.


2.  Applicability Statement

   The method described in Section 3 is a sample illustration to
   demonstrate how to protect the router control plane from unwanted
   traffic.  Recognizing that deployment scenarios will vary, the exact
   implementation is not generally applicable in all situations.  The
   cateorization of legitimate control plane traffic is critically
   important in a successul implementation.

   The examples given in this memo are simplified and minimalistic,
   designed to illustrate the concept of protecting the router's control
   plane.  From them, operators can extrapolate specifics based on their
   unique configuration and environment.

   This method is applicable for IPv4 as well as IPv6 traffic.  The
   sample legitimate traffic in Section 3.1 uses IPv4 addresses, but can
   be expanded to IPv6 as well.


3.  Method

   In this memo, the authors demonstrate how a filter protecting the
   control plane can be deployed.  In Section 3.1, a sample router
   introduced and all traffic that its control plane must process is
   identified.  In Section 3.2, filter design concepts are discussed.
   Cisco (Cisco IOS software) and Juniper (JUNOS) implementations are
   provided in Appendices A and B, respectively.

3.1.  Legitimate Traffic

   In this example, the router control plane must process traffic from
   the following sources:

Internet-Draft            Protect Control Plane             January 2010


   o  ICMP traffic from any source, rate-limited to 2 Mbps

   o  OSPF traffic from routers within own network (network mask
      192.0.2.0/24)

   o  iBGP traffic from routers within own network (network mask
      192.0.2.0/24)

   o  eBGP traffic from known eBGP peers (network addresses
      198.51.100.25, 198.51.100.27, 198.51.100.29, 198.51.100.31)

   o  DNS traffic from local DNS resolvers (198.51.100.0/30)

   o  NTP traffic from local NTP (198.51.100.4/30)

   o  SSH traffic from network management stations (198.51.100.128/25)

   o  SNMP traffic from network management stations (198.51.100.128/25)

   The characteristics of legitimate traffic will vary from network to
   network.  The list provided above is for example only.

3.2.  Filter Design

   A filter is installed on the forwarding plane.  This filter counts
   and silently discards all traffic not matching the profile provided
   in Section 3.1.  Because the filter is enforced on the forwarding
   plane, it prevents unwanted traffic from consuming bandwidth on the
   interface that connects the forwarding plane to the control plane.
   The counters serve as an important forensic tool for the analysis of
   potential attacks, and as an invaluable debugging and troubleshooting
   aid.

   A rate limiter also is installed on the forwarding plane.  The rate
   limiter restricts ICMP traffic bound for the control plane to some
   reasonable volume.  In our example, we will rate limit to 2 Megabits
   per second (Mbps).

   Syntactically, these filters explicitly define "allowed" traffic
   (including IP addresses, protocols, and ports), define acceptable
   actions for these acceptable traffic profiles (e.g., rate-limit or
   simply permit the traffic), and then drop to the bit bucket all
   traffic destined to the control plane but not explicitly allowed.

3.3.  Design Trade-offs

   In designing the protection method, there are two independent parts
   to consider: the classification of traffic (i.e., which traffic is



Dugal, et al.            Expires August 2, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            Protect Control Plane             January 2010


   matched by the filters), and the policy actions taken on the
   classified traffic.

   There are different levels of granularity utilized for traffic
   classification.  For example, allowing all traffic from specific
   source IP addresses versus allowing only a specific set of protocols
   from those specific source IP addresses will each affect a different
   set of traffic.

   Similarly, the policy actions taken on the classified traffic have
   degrees of impact that may not become immediately obvious.  For
   example, discarding all ICMP traffic may have a negative impact on
   the operational use of ICMP tools such as ping or traceroute to debug
   network issues or to test turn up of a new circuit.

   It is important to note that both classification and policy action
   decisions are accompanied by respective trade-offs.  Two examples of
   these trade-off decisions are, operational complexity at the expense
   of policy (and statistics gathering) detail, and tighter protection
   at the expense of network supportability and troubleshooting ability.

   The goal of the method for protecting the router control plane is to
   minimize potential disruptions.  The granularity of the filter design
   inversely correlates to the scope of the potential disruption.  The
   finer the granularity of the filter design (e.g., isolating kinds of
   sub-traffic from the rest of the policed traffic, or isolating valid
   source addresses into a different class or classes) the smaller the
   scope of disruption.


4.  Security Considerations

   The filter above leaves the router susceptible to discovery from any
   host on the Internet.  If network operators find this risk
   objectionable, they can mitigate it by restricting the sub-networks
   from which ICMP Echo requests are accepted.

   The filter above also leaves the router exposed to port scans from
   hosts spoofing the source addresses found in Section 3.1.  Network
   operators can mitigate this risk by preventing source address
   spoofing with filters applied at the network edge.  Refer to Section
   5.3.8 of [RFC1812] for more information regarding source address
   validation.  Other methods also exist for limiting exposure to packet
   spoofing such as the Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)
   [RFC5082] and Ingress Filtering [RFC3704].

   The ICMP rate limiter specified in this filter protects the router
   from floods of ICMP traffic.  However, during an ICMP flood, some



Dugal, et al.            Expires August 2, 2010                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            Protect Control Plane             January 2010


   legitimate ICMP traffic may be dropped.  Because of this, when
   operators discover a flood of ICMP traffic, they are highly motivated
   to cut it off at its source.

   Additional considerations pertaining to the usage and handling of
   traffic that utilizes the IP Router Alter Options can be found at
   [I-D.rahman-rtg-router-alert-considerations].

   The treatment of exception traffic in the forwarding plane, and the
   generation of specific messages by the control plane also requires
   protection from a DoS attack.  Specifically, the generation of ICMP
   Unreachable messages by the control plane needs to be rate-limited,
   either implicitly within the router's architecture or explicitly
   through configuration.  See Section 4.3.2.8 of [RFC1812].

   Additionally, the handling of TTL / Hop Limit expired traffic needs
   protection.  For example, rate limiting the TTL / Hop Limit expired
   traffic before sending the packets to the control plane component
   that will send the ICMP error, and distributing the sending of ICMP
   errors in a Line Card CPU are protection mechanisms that deter
   attacks before a rate limited in the main control plane component.
