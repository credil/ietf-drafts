                    Extended Message support for BGP
                  draft-ymbk-bgp-extended-messages-00

Abstract

   The current BGP specification mandates a maximum BGP message size of
   4096 octets.  As BGP is extended to support newer AFI/SAFIs, there is
   a need to extend the maximum message size beyond 4096 octets.  This
   draft provides an extension for BGP to extend its current message
   size for BGP messages from 4096 octets to 65535 octets.

Internet-Draft      Extended Message support for BGP          March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The current BGP specification [RFC4271] mandates a maximum BGP
   message size of 4096 octets.  As BGP is extended to support newer
   AFI/SAFIs and newer capabilities, there is a need to extend the
   maximum message size beyond 4096 octets.  This draft provides an
   extension for BGP to extend its current message size for BGP messages
   from 4096 octets to 65535 octets.


2.  Extended message Capability for BGP

   To advertise BGP Extended Message Capability to a peer, a BGP speaker
   uses BGP Capabilities Advertisement [RFC3392].  By advertising the
   BGP Extended message Capability to a peer, a BGP speaker conveys to
   that peer that the speaker is capable of receiving and properly
   handling BGP Extended Messages.

   This is an asymmetric capability.  I.e. one speaker could signal the
   capability and the other not, so that extended messages could flow
   only in the direction toward the speaker which advertised the
   capability.

   The BGP Extended Message Capability is a new BGP Capability [RFC3392]
   defined with Capability code TBD and Capability length 0.


3.  Operation

   A BGP speaker that is willing to receive BGP Extended Messages from
   its peer should advertise the BGP Extended Message Capability to its
   peer using BGP Capabilities Advertisement [RFC3392].  A BGP speaker
   may send extended messages to its peer only if it has received the
   Extended Message Capability from its peer.

   All BGP extended messages have maximum message size of 65535 octets.
   The smallest message that may be sent consists of a BGP header
   without a data portion (19 octets).  All multi-octet fields are in
   network byte order.


4.  Acknowledgements

   The authors thank John Scudder for his input.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the Extended Message Capability for BGP.  The
   new Capability code needs to be assigned by IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change BGP's underlying security
   issues.
