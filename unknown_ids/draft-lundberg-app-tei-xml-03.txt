Internet-Draft     The 'application/tei+xml' mediatype    September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The TEI is an international and interdisciplinary standard that is
   widely used by libraries, museums, publishers, and individual
   scholars to represent all kinds of textual material for online
   research and teaching.  [TEI]

   In order to increase the possibilities for generic XML processing of
   TEI documents on the Internet this document defines the 'application/
   tei+xml' media type in accordance with [RFC3023].

2.  Registration of MIME type 'application/tei+xml'

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: tei+xml

      Required parameters: None

      Optional parameters: charset

         Identical with charset in [RFC3023]

      Encoding considerations:

         By virtue of TEI XML content being XML, it has the same
         considerations when sent as 'application/tei+xml' as does XML
         in general.  See RFC 3023 [RFC3023], Section 3.2.

      Security considerations:

         TEI elements may refer to arbitrary URIs.  Hence the security
         issues of [RFC3986], section 7, apply.  See also Security
         considerations (Section 5)

      Interoperability considerations:

         TEI documents often have the extension '.xml', which is not
         uncommon for other XML document formats.

      Published specification:

         This media type registration is for TEI documents as described
         in the TEI Guidelines[TEI].

      Applications which use this media type:

         There are currently no applications using the media type
         'application/tei+xml'.  It will be an entirely new type which
         is registered in order to allow for the deployment of TEI on
         the World Wide Web as a first class XML application.

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s):

            There is no single initial octet sequence that is always
            present in TEI documents.

         file extension(s):

            Common extensions are '.tei', '.teiCorpus' and '.odd'.

         Macintosh File Type Code(s)

            TEXT

         Object Identifier(s) or OID(s)

            Not applicable

3.  Recognizing TEI files

   TEI files are XML documents or fragments having the root element in a
   TEI namespace, i.e., a namespace URI starting with
   http://www.tei-c.org/ns/ followed by the version number of the
   namespace.  The current namespace is http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0

   In general, a [TEI] file usually contains either of the strings

      <TEI

      <teiCorpus

   near the beginning, and usually after an XML declaration on the first
   line, i.e., a string like "<?xml ... ?>".

   Examples:

      Frequently, the actual XML content of TEI files will contain <TEI
      somewhere early on.

      More specialized types of documents may start with a lower case
      tei as in <teiCorpus.

4.  Fragment identifier

   Documents having the media type 'application/tei+xml', use the
   fragment identifier notation in the way specified in [RFC3023] for
   the media type 'application/xml'.

5.  Security considerations

   An XML resource does not in itself compromise data security.  When
   being available on a network simply through the dereferencing of an
   IRI [RFC3987] or a URI, care must be taken to properly interpret the
   data to prevent unintended access.

5.1.  Harmful content

   Any application accepting submitted or retrieving TEI XML for
   processing has to be aware of risks connected with injection of
   harmful scripts and executable XML.  Even common XML inclusion or the
   use of external entities, could potentially be used to reveal aspects
   of a service that may compromise its security.  Any vulnerability of
   these kinds are, however, application specific.  The TEI namespaces
   do not contain such elements.

5.2.  Intellectual Property Rights

   TEI documents often arise in digitization of cultural heritage
   materials.  Texts made accessible in TEI format may be free in the
   sense that there are no restrictions to their distribution through
   Digital Rights Management[DRM] or Intellectual Property Rights[IPR]
   constraints.  TEI documents are heterogeneous objects.  Some parts of
   a document may be free, whereas other parts, such as editorial text
   and annotations may be written much later may hence be subject to DRM
   restrictions.

   The TEI format provides means for highly granular attribution, down
   to the content of individual XML elements.  Software agents
   participating in the exchange or processing TEI must honour markup of
   this kind.  Even when there are no IPR constraints, intellectual
   honesty alone requires that document users are able to tell the
   difference between content from different sources.

5.3.  Authenticity and confidentiality

   Historical archival records are often encoded in TEI and legal
   document may be binding centuries after they were written.
   Digitization and encoding of legal texts may require technologies for
   assuring authenticity, such as cryptographic check sums and
   electronic signatures.

   Similarly, historical documents may in part their entirety be
   confidential.  This may be required by law or by the terms and
   conditions of a donation.  A text archive need content filtering or
   cryptographic technologies to meet such requirements.
