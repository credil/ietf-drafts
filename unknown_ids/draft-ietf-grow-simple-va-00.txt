                   Simple Virtual Aggregation (S-VA)
                    draft-ietf-grow-simple-va-00.txt

Abstract

   The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT)
   stresses the global routing system in a number of ways.  One of the
   most costly stresses is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade router
   hardware simply because the FIB has run out of space, and router
   vendors must design routers that have adequate FIB.  FIB suppression
   is an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT loading selected
   RIB entries into the FIB.  Simple Virtual Aggregation (S-VA) is a
   simple form of Virtual Aggregation (VA) that allows any and all edge
   routers to shrink their FIB requirements substantially and therefore
   increase their useful lifetime.  S-VA does not change FIB
   requirements for core routers.  S-VA is extremely easy to
   configure---considerably more so than the various tricks done today
   to extend the life of edge routers.  S-VA can be deployed
   autonomously by an ISP (cooperation between ISPs is not required),
   and can co-exist with legacy routers in the ISP.

1.  Introduction

   ISPs today manage constant DFRT growth in a number of ways.  One way,
   of course, is for ISPs to upgrade their router hardware before DFRT
   growth outstrips the size of the FIB.  This is too expensive for many
   ISPs.  They would prefer to extend the lifetime of routers whose FIBs
   can no longer hold the full DFRT.

   A common approach taken by lower-tier ISPs is to default route to
   their providers.  Routes to customers and peer ISPs are maintained,
   but everything else defaults to the provider.  This approach has
   several disadvantages.  First, packets to Internet destinations may
   take longer-than-necessary AS paths.  This problem can be mitigated
   through careful configuration of partial defaults, but this can
   require substantial configuration overhead.  A second problem with
   defaulting to providers is that the ISP is no longer able to provide
   the full DFRT to its customers.  Finally, provider defaults prevents
   the ISP from being able to detect martian packets.  As a result, the
   ISP transmits packets that could otherwise have been dropped over its
   expensive provider links.  Simple Virtual Aggregation (S-VA) solves
   these problems because the full DFRT is used by core routers.

   An alternative is for the ISP to maintain full routes in its core
   routers, but to filter routes from edge routers that do not require a
   full DFRT.  These edge routers can then default route to the core
   routers.  This is often possible with edge routers that interface to
   customer networks.  The problem with this approach is that it cannot
   be used for all edge routers.  For instance, it cannot be used for
   routers that connect to transits.  It should also not be used for
   routers that connect to customers which wish to receive the full
   DFRT.

   This draft describes a very simple technique, called Simple Virtual
   Aggregation (S-VA), that allows any and all edge routers to have
   substantially reduced FIB requirements even while still advertising
   and receiving the full DFRT over BGP.  The basic idea is as follows.
   Core routers in the ISP maintain the full DFRT in the FIB and RIB.
   Edge routers maintain the full DFRT in the RIB, but suppress certain
   routes from the FIB.  Edge routers install a default route to core
   routers.  Label Switched Paths (LSP) are used to transmit packets
   from a core router, through the edge router, to the Next Hop remote
   Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR).  ASBRs strip the tunnel
   header (MPLS or IP) before forwarding tunneled packets to the remote
   ASBR (in much the same way MPLS Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP) strips
   the LSP header before forwarding packets to the tunnel target).

   S-VA requires no changes to BGP and no changes to MPLS forwarding
   mechanisms in routers.  Configuration is extremely simple: S-VA must

   be enabled, and routers must told whether they are FIB-suppressing
   routers or not.  Everything else is automatic.  ISPs can deploy FIB
   suppression autonomously and with no coordination with neighbor ASes.

1.1.  Scope of this Document

   The scope of this document is limited to Intra-domain S-VA operation.
   In other words, the case where a single ISP autonomously operates
   S-VA internally without any coordination with neighboring ISPs.

   Note that this document assumes that the S-VA "domain" (i.e. the unit
   of autonomy) is the AS (that is, different ASes run S-VA
   independently and without coordination).  For the remainder of this
   document, the terms ISP, AS, and domain are used interchangeably.

   This document applies equally to IPv4 and IPv6.

   S-VA may operate with a mix of upgraded routers and legacy routers.
   There are no topological restrictions placed on the mix of routers.
   In order to avoid loops between upgraded and legacy routers, however,
   legacy routers must be able to terminate tunnels.

   Note that S-VA is a greatly simplified variant of "full VA"
   [I-D.ietf-grow-va].  With full VA, all routers (core or otherwise)
   can have reduced FIBs.  However, full VA requires substantial new
   configuration and operational complexity compared to S-VA.  Note that
   S-VA was formerly specified in [I-D.ietf-grow-va].  It has been moved
   to this separate draft to simplify its understanding.

1.2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.3.  Terminology

   FIB-Installing Router (FIR):  An S-VA router that does not suppress
      any routes, and advertises itself as a default route for 0/0.
      Typically a core router or route reflector would be configured as
      an FIR.
   FIB-Suppressing Router (FSR):  An S-VA router that installs a route
      to 0/0, and may suppress other routes.  Typically an edge router
      would be configured as an FSR.

Internet-Draft                    S-VA                        March 2010


   Install and Suppress:  The terms "install" and "suppress" are used to
      describe whether a RIB entry has been loaded or not loaded into
      the FIB.  In other words, the phrase "install a route" means
      "install a route into the FIB", and the phrase "suppress a route"
      means "do not install a route into the FIB".
   Legacy Router:  A router that does not run S-VA, and has no knowledge
      of S-VA.
   Routing Information Base (RIB):  The term RIB is used rather sloppily
      in this document to refer either to the loc-RIB (as used in
      [RFC4271]), or to the combined Adj-RIBs-In, the Loc-RIB, and the
      Adj-RIBs-Out.

1.4.  Temporary Sections

   This section contains temporary information, and will be removed in
   the final version.

1.4.1.  Document revisions

   Note that S-VA was formerly specified in [I-D.ietf-grow-va].  No new
   functionality is specified in this draft.


2.  Operation of S-VA

   There are three types of routers in S-VA, FIB-Installing routers
   (FIR), FIB-Suppressing routers (FSR), and optionally legacy routers.
   While any router can be an FIR or an FSR (there are no topology
   constraints), the simplist form of deployment is for border routers
   to be configured as edge routers, and for non-border routers (for
   instance the routers used as route reflectors) to be configured as
   core routers.  S-VA, however, does not mandate this deployment per
   se.

   FIRs must originate a BGP route to NLRI 0/0 [RFC4271].  The ORIGIN is
   set to INCOMPLETE (value 2), the AS number of the FIR's AS is used in
   the AS_PATH, and the BGP NEXT_HOP is set to the router's own address.
   The ATOMIC_AGGREGATE and AGGREGATOR attributes are not included.  The
   FIR MUST attach a NO_EXPORT Communities Attribute [RFC1997] to the
   route.

   FIRs must not FIB-suppress any routes.

   FSRs must FIB-install a route to 0/0.  When transmitting a packet to
   a FIR (i.e. based on a 0/0 FIB lookup), the packet must be tunneled.
   This is to prevent loops that would otherwise occur when a packet
   transits multiple FSRs on the way to the core, some of which have
   FIB-installed the route for the destination, and others of which have

Internet-Draft                    S-VA                        March 2010


   not.  FSRs may FIB-install any other routes.  They should install any
   routes for which their eBGP neighbor is the NEXT_HOP.  There are a
   couple reasons for this, which can be illustrated in the figure
   below.  This figure shows an autonomous system with a FIR FIR1 and an
   FSR FSR1.  FSR1 is an ASBR and is connected to two remote ASBRs, EP1
   and EP2.

        +------------------------------------------+

   Suppose that FSR1 does not FIB-install routes for which EP1 and EP2
   are next hops.  In this case, when EP2 sends a packet to FSR1 for
   which the next hop is EP1, FSR1 will first tunnel the packet to FIR1,
   which will tunnel it right back to FSR1.  This trombone routing is
   avoided if local ASBRs FIB-install routes where their neighbor remote
   ASBRs are the BGP NEXT_HOP.

   In addition, FSR1 cannot filter source addresses using strict unicast
   Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) unless it FIB-installs the routes
   learned from the remote ASBR.  Note, however, that FSRs cannot do
   loose uRPF.  Rather, this must be done by FIRs.

   The above observations lead to the following rules: FSRs that are
   ASBRs should FIB-install all routes for which the neighbor is the BGP
   NEXT_HOP.  FSRs that are ASBRs must FIB-install any routes that are
   used for uRPF.

2.1.  Tunnels

   S-VA works with both MPLS and IP-in-IP tunnels.  There are
   potentially up to two tunnels required for a packet to traverse an AS
   with S-VA.  The first tunnel is that from an FSR to a FIR (for the
   0/0 default).  This is called the default tunnel.  The second tunnel
   targets the remote ASBR which is the BGP NEXT_HOP, although the
   tunnel header is stripped by the local ASBR before transmitting to
   the remote ASBR.  This is the exit tunnel.  The start of the exit
   tunnel is an ingress local ASBR in the case where the ingress local
   ASBR has FIB-installed the associated route.  Otherwise, the start of



Francis, et al.         Expires September 2, 2010               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                    S-VA                        March 2010


   the exit tunnel is a FIR.

   The target address of the default tunnel is always the FIR.  If MPLS
   is used, the FIRs must initiate LSPs to themselves using either the
   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036].  RSVP-TE [RFC3209] may
   also be used.

   If IP-in-IP tunnels are used, then the BGP Encapsulation Extended
   Community (BGPencap-Attribute) ([RFC5512]) is used to convey the
   ability to accept tunnels at the target address (the BGP NEXT_HOP).

   For the exit tunnels, again either MPLS or IP-in-IP can be used.  In
   the case of IP-in-IP, the inner label defined in [RFC4023] and
   signaled in BGP with [RFC3107] is used by the local ASBR to identify
   the remote ASBR which is the BGP NEXT_HOP for the packet.
   Specifically, when a local ASBR, which can be either an FSR or a FIR,
   advertises an eBGP-received route into iBGP, it sets the BGP NEXT_HOP
   as itself.  It assigns a label to the route.  This label is used as
   the inner label in packets tunneled to the local ASBR, and is used to
   identify the remote ASBR from which the route was received.  When
   receiving a packet with this label, the local ASBR strips off the
   label, and forwards the native packet to the remote ASBR indicated by
   the label.

   In the case of MPLS, the inner label may or may not be used.  If it
   is used, then an LSP is established to the IP address of the local
   ASBR as described above for FIRs.  The BGP NEXT_HOP is set to be
   itself (the same address that serves as the FEC in the LSP).  The
   inner label is established as described in the previous paragraph for
   IP-in-IP tunnels, but with the encapsulation defined in [RFC3032].

   If the inner label is not used, then the local ASBR must initiate a
   Downstream Unsolicited LSP for each remote ASBR.  The FEC for the LSP
   is the remote ASBR address that is used in the BGP NEXT_HOP field.
   When a packet is received on one of these LSPs, the local ASBR strips
   the MPLS header, and forwards the packet to the remote ASBR indicated
   by the label.

2.2.  Legacy Routers

   S-VA may be operated with a mix of legacy and S-VA-upgraded routers.
   The legacy routers, however, must be able to forward tunneled
   packets.  In the case of MPLS tunnels, this means that they must
   fully participate in MPLS signaling.  If a legacy router is an ASBR,
   then it must also initiate tunnels to itself and be able to detunnel
   packets (without the inner label).
