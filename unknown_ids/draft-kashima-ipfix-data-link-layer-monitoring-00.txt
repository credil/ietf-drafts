Internet-Draft         Data Link Layer Monitoring           October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Ethernet [IEEE802.1D] and VLAN (Virtual LAN) [IEEE802.1Q]
   technologies used to be used only in Local Area Networks.  Recently,
   they have been used in Wide Area Networks, e.g.  L2-VPN services.
   Accordingly, IEEE802.1Q standard has been enhanced to [IEEE802.1ad]
   and [IEEE802.1ah].

   Wide-area Ethernet networks will be renovated from IEEE802.1ad to
   coexisting IEEE802.1ad and IEEE802.1ah in the near future.
   IEEE802.1d will continuously be utilized in access networks, and
   IEEE802.1ah will be introduced in provider backbone networks.

   The IPFIX/PSAMP could play a role to help resolve these problems.
   However, PSAMP Information Model [RFC5477] does not have Information
   Elements related to Ethernet header from.  In this document, we
   propose Information Elements related to data link layer to allow a
   more sophisticated traffic measurement method.


2.  Wide-Area Ethernet Network Summary

   [IEEE802.1ad] and [IEEE802.1ah], which are methods to support the
   Wide-Area Ethernet, are described below.

   o  In IEEE802.1ad, there are two VLAN IDs: S-VID (Service VLAN
      Identifier) and C-VID (Customer VLAN Identifier).  S-VID is
      assigned to an Ethernet frame by a service provider, while C-VID
      is independently assigned to an Ethernet frame by a customer.
      Frame switching in a service provider network is based on only
      S-VID.
   o  In IEEE802.1ah, new Ethernet fields, such as B-VID (Backbone VLAN
      Identifier) and I-SID (Backbone Service Instance Identifier), are
      introduced in order to overcome the limitations on the VLAN
      identifier space on IEEE802.1ad, isolate the service provider
      identifier space and customer identifier space.  Frame switching
      is based on a 12bit B-VID, and customer identification is based on
      a 24bit I-SID.  A flexible network design has become possible
      because network management is separated from customer management.
      Other Ethernet fields which indicate QoS class are: B-PCP, B-DEI,
      I- PCP, I-DEI.

   IEEE802.1ah will be introduced into a back bone network in an actual
   Ethernet network, and the wide-area Ethernet service is expected to
   change from a flat network with IEEE802.1ad to hierarchical network
   co-existing with IEEE802.1ad and IEEE802.1ah.

3.  Existing Traffic Measurement

   In a wide-area Ethernet network, network administrators require to
   measure traffic volume for each VPN customer and for each QoS class
   in addition to interface-based traffic measurement.  This measurement
   makes it possible to provide the traffic report to network
   administrators for capacity planing and traffic engineering, and to
   customers.

   At present, network administrators use a variety of special
   measurement methods, such as an Enterprise MIB, from various vendors,
   various device types (router, switch, or probe) in a single network
   domain.  It is difficult to mediate the differences.  And it will
   lead to limitation in the future network with [IEEE802.1ah].


4.  Future Traffic Measurement

   After installing [IEEE802.1ah] in a backbone network, more
   sophisticated traffic measurement method than that used today will be
   required because network administrators require to measure traffic
   volume for each VPN customer and for each QoS class, without regard
   for the distinction between IEEE802.1ah and [IEEE802.1ad].  In case
   of IEEE802.1ah, traffic measurement for QoS class is more complicated
   due to consideration for multiple parameters related to QoS.  As the
   use of multicast applications increases, it will be required to get
   statistical data for each parameter and each frame type (unicast,
   multicast and broadcast).

   The requirements for the method are as follows:

   o  Flexible traffic measurement architecture, which can be applied to
      [IEEE802.1D], [IEEE802.1Q], IEEE802.1ad and IEEE802.1ah.
   o  No software upgrade for a switching device, even when a network
      administrator requires the traffic data based on new Ethernet
      field.

   The above means that it is possible to apply the architecture of
   IPFIX/PSAMP.  Therefore, in this document, we propose an Ethernet
   traffic measurement method using IPFIX/PSAMP, as follows.

   The device (Exporter) samples Ethernet frames using PSAMP, extracts
   the header of the frame, and exports the header information extracted
   via IPFIX to the Collector.  The Collector sums up the number of
   frames and the number of octets for each Ethernet type (e.g.
   multicast or broadcast) and Ethernet header fields (e.g.  I-SID).

   Furthermore, the device (Exporter) filters and samples traffic for

   each VPN using a Composite Selector of PSAMP [RFC5475].  This makes
   it possible to change the granularity of the traffic monitoring for
   each VPN.


5.  Information Elements

   We propose adding the following Information Elements to [RFC5477] in
   order to allow the above-mentioned method, which are not limited to
   Ethernet because the method can be applied to other data link
   protocols.

5.1.  dataLinkFrameSize

   Description:

      This Information Element specifies the size of the sampled data
      link frame, and SHOULD be checked before analyzing higher layer
      protocols.
      The data link layer is defined in [ISO_IEC.7498-1_1994].

   Abstract Data Type: unsigned32

   Data Type Semantics: quantity

   ElementId: XXX

   Status: current

5.2.  dataLinkFrameSection

   Description:

      This Information Element, which may have a variable length,
      carries the first n octets from the data link frame of a sampled
      packet.
      The data link layer is defined in [ISO_IEC.7498-1_1994].
      The size of the exported section may be constrained due to
      limitations in the IPFIX protocol.

      The data for this field MUST NOT be padded.  If insufficient
      octets are available for the length specified in the Template,
      then a new Template MUST be used.

   security issues to those already mentioned in [RFC5101] and
   [RFC5477].
