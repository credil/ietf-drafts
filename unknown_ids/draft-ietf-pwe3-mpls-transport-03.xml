    <section title="Introduction ">
      <t>The operator community has identified the need for the transparent
      carriage of the MPLS(-TP) network of one party over the MPLS(-TP)
      network of another party <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-requirements"></xref>. This document describes
      one mechanism to satisfy this requirement using existing IETF standards
      such as PWE3 Ethernet pseudowire standard <xref target="RFC4448"></xref>
      . The mechanism described here fulfills the MPLS-TP requirements for
      transparent carriage (MPLS-TP requirements 20 &amp; 21) of the Ethernet
      data plane.</t>

      <t>The key purpose of this document is to demonstrate that there is an
      existing IETF mechanism with known implementations that satisfies the
      requirements posed by the operator community. It is recognised that it
      is possible to design a more efficient method of satisfying the
      requirements, and the IETF anticipates that improved solutions will be
      proposed in the future.</t>

      <t>Much of the notation used in this document is defined in <xref
      target="RFC3985"></xref> to which the reader is referred for
      definitions.</t>

      <t>The architecture required for this mechanism is illustrated in Figure
      1 below.</t>

        <postamble>Figure 1: Application Ethernet over MPLS PW to MPLS
        Transport Networks</postamble>
      </figure>

      <t></t>

      <t>An 802.3 (Ethernet) circuit is established between CE1 and CE2. This
      circuit may be used for the concurrent transport of MPLS packets as well
      as IPv4 and IPv6 packets. The MPLS packets may carry IPv4, IPV6, or
      Pseudowire payloads, and Penultimate-Hop-Popping (PHP) may be used. For
      clarity these paths are labeled as the client in Figure 1.</t>

      <t>An Ethernet pseudowire (PW) is provisioned between PE1 and PE2 and
      used to carry the Ethernet from PE1 to PE2. The Ethernet PW is carried
      over an MPLS packet switched Netwok (PSN), but this PSN must not be
      configured with PHP. For clarity this Ethernet PW and the MPLS PSN are
      labeled as the server in Figure 1. In the remainder of this draft call
      the server network a transport network.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="PWE3 Configuration ">
      <t>The PWE3 encapsulation used by this specification to satisfy the
      transport requirement is Ethernet <xref target="RFC4448"></xref>. This
      is used in "raw" mode.</t>

      <t>The Control Word must be used. The Sequence number must be zero.</t>

      <t>The use of the Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Label Distribution
      Protocol <xref target="RFC4447"></xref> is not required by the profile
      of the PWE3 Ethernet pseudowire functionality defined in this
      document.</t>

      <t>The Pseudowire Label is statically provisioned.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="OAM ">
      <t>Within a connection, traffic units sent from the single source are
      constrained to stay within the connection under defect-free conditions.
      During misconnected defects, a connection can no longer be assumed to be
      constrained and traffic units (and by implication also OAM packets) can
      'leak' uni-directionally outside a connection. Therefore during a
      misconnected state, it is not possible to rely on OAM which relies on a
      request/response mechanism ; and, for this reason such OAM should be
      treated with caution if used for diagnostic purposes.</t>

      <t>Further, when implementing an Equal Cost Multi-path (ECMP) function
      with MPLS, use of the label stack as the path selector such that the OAM
      and data are not in a co-path as any failure in the data path will note
      be reflected in the OAM path. Therefore, an OAM that is carried within
      the data-path below the PW label such as Virtual Circuit Connectivity
      Verification (VCCV) is NOT vulnerable to the above failure mode. For
      these reasons the OAM mechanism is <xref target="RFC5085"></xref>, using
      Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BDF) <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-bfd-base"></xref> for connection verification (CV). The
      method of using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) as a CV method
      in VCCV is described in [I-D.draft-ietf-pwe3-vccv-bfd] . One of the VCCV
      profiles described in Section 3.1 or Section 3.2 must be used. Once a
      VCCV control channel is provisioned, and the operational status of the
      PW is UP, no other profile SHOULD be used until such time as the PW's
      operational status is set to DOWN.</t>

      <section title="VCCV profile 1: BFD without IP/UDP Headers">
        <t>When PE1 and PE1 are not IP capable or have not been configured
        with IP addresses, the following VCCV mechanism SHOULD be used.</t>

        <t>The connection verification method used by VCCV is BFD with
        diagnostics as defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-pwe3-vccv-bfd].</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC5085"></xref> specifies that the first nibble is
        set to 0x1 to indicate a channel associated with a pseudowire <xref
        target="RFC4385"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The Version and the Reserved fields are set to zero, and the
        Channel Type is set to [TBD] to indicate that the payload carried is
        BFD without IP/UDP headers, as is defined in
        [I-D.draft-ietf-pwe3-vccv-bfd].</t>
      </section>

      <section title="VCCV profile 2: BFD with IP/UDP Headers">
        <t>When PE1 and PE1 are IP capable and have been configured with IP
        addresses, the following VCCV mechanism may be used.</t>

        <t>The Version and the Reserved fields are set to 0, and the Channel
        Type is set to 0x21 for IPv4 and 0x56 for IPv6 payloads <xref

    </section>

    <section title="MPLS Layer  ">
      <t>The architecture of MPLS enabled networks is described in <xref
      target="RFC3031"></xref>. This section describes a subset of the
      functionality of the MPLS enabled PSN. There are two cases that need to
      be considered: <list style="numbers">
          <t>The case where external configuration is used.</t>

          <t>The case where a control plane is available.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Where the use of a control plane is desired this may be based on
      Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) <xref
      target="RFC3945"> </xref></t>

      <section title="External Configuration  ">
        <t>The use of external provisioning is not precluded from being
        supported by the current MPLS specifications. It is however expicitly
        described in this specification to addess the requirements specified
        by the ITU <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-requirements"></xref> to
        address the needs in a transport environment.</t>

        <t>The MPLS encapsulation is specified in <xref target="RFC3032">
        </xref>. All MPLS labels used in the server layer (Figure 1) must be
        statically provisioned. Labels may be selected from either the
        per-platform or the per-interface label space.</t>

        <t>All transport Label Switched Paths (LSPs) utilized by the PWs
        described in section 2 must support both unidirectional and
        bi-directional point-to-point connections.</t>

        <t>The transport LSPs SHOULD support unidirectional
        point-to-multipoint connections.</t>

        <t>The forward and backward directions of a bi-directional connection
        should follow a symmetrically routed (reciprocal) LSP in the server
        network.</t>

        <t>Equal cost multi-path (ECMP) load balancing must not be configured
        on the transport LSPs utilized by the PWs described in sections 2.</t>

        <t>The merging of label switched paths is prohibited and must not be
        configured for the transport LSPs utilized by the PWs described in
        section 2.</t>

        <t>Penultimate hop popping by the transport label switched routers
        (LSRs) must be disabled on transport LSPs.</t>

        <t>Both EXP-Inferred-PSC LSPs (E-LSP) and Label-Only-Inferred-PSC LSPs
        (L-LSP) must be supported as defined in <xref
        target="RFC3270"></xref>.</t>

        <t>For the MPLS EXP field <xref target="RFC3270"></xref> <xref
        target="RFC5462"></xref> only the pipe and short-pipe models are
        supported.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Control Plane Configuration ">
        <t>In this section we describe the control plane configuration
        when<xref target="RFC3209"> </xref> &ldquo;RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP
        for LSP Tunnels&rdquo; or the bi-directional support in GMPLS <xref

        Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic
        Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions&rdquo; are used to configure the
        transport MPLS PSN. When these protocols are used to provide the
        control plane the following are automatically provided:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>There is no label merging unless it is deliberately enabled to
            support Fast Re-route (FRR) <xref target="RFC3209"></xref>.</t>

            <t>A single path is provided end-to-end (there is no ECMP).</t>

            <t>Label switched paths may be unidirectional or bidirectional as
            required.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Additionally the following configurations restrictions required to
        support external configuration must be applied:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">

            <t>Both E-LSP and L-LSP must be supported as defined in <xref

            <t>The MPLS EXP <xref target="RFC5462"></xref> field is supported
            according to <xref target="RFC3270"></xref> for only when the pipe

    <section title="Congestion Considerations ">
      <t>This draft describes a method of using the existing PWE3 Ethernet
      pseudowire <xref target="RFC4448"></xref> to solve a particular network
      application. The congestion considerations associated with that
      pseudowire and all subsequent work on congestion considerations
      regarding Ethernet pseudowires is applicable to this draft.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This draft is a description of the use of existing IETF proposed
      standards to solve a network problem, and raises no new security
      issues.</t>

      <t>The PWE3 security considerations are described in <xref
      target="RFC3985"></xref> and the Ethernet pseudowire security
      considerations of<xref target="RFC4448"> </xref>.</t>

      <t>The Ethernet pseudowire is transported on an MPLS PSN; therefore, the
      security of the pseudowire itself will only be as good as the security
      of the MPLS PSN. The server MPLS PSN can be secured by various methods,
      as described in<xref target="RFC3031"> </xref>.</t>

      <t>The use of static configuration exposes an MPLS PSN to a different
      set of security risks to those found in a PSN using dynamic routing. If
      a path is missconfigured in a staticly configued network the result can
      be a persistent black hole, or much worst, a persistent forwarding loop.
      On the otherhand most of the distributed components are less complex.
      This is however offset by the need to provide failover and redundancy in
      the management and configuration system and the communications paths
      between those central systems and the LSRs.</t>

      <t>Security achieved by access control of media access control (MAC)
      addresses , and the security of the client layers is out of the scope of
      this document.</t>
