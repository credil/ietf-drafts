                      Federated Cross-Layer Access
                        draft-wei-abfab-fcla-00

Abstract

   Network stratum and application stratum form a federation to
   faciliate user's access.  Network operator acts as Identity Provider
   (IdP), and application reuses underlying network's security
   capabilities to simlify application's access.  This document is to
   introduce such federated cross-layer access use case.

1.  Introduction

   Currently it is agreed that digital identity is a crucial element in
   a service enviroment.  Typically telecom operators provide access
   customers with identity which is associated with some form of trusted
   element on the network (e.g.  SIM/UICC).  Meanwhile the identity
   required by Web or non-Web services for users on is usually
   associated with username.

   Ordinarly telecom operators have tens of millons of users and can
   provide trusted identity and higher security.  However the categories
   of service provided by telecom operators are relatively few.  On the
   contrary most service providers on the Internet have limited amount
   of users and can not assure the security of user identity, but they
   can provide abundant kinds of service.  Furthermore, user is
   reluntant to register too many accounts because it is inconvenient to
   remember dozens of passwords .  These facts creates some driving
   forces that telecom is interworking with Internet.  The stakeholders
   can benifit from these combination.  For telecom operators, they can
   provide identity service, trusted security service, mobile payment
   service and sharing some user profiles according user's preferences.
   Telecom operators is not just providing pipeine for communication,
   but also become a part of service value chain.  For service
   providers, they can focus on core business and reuse capabilities
   provided by telecom operators without worring about sources of users.
   For end users, they can enjoy seamless service experiences and
   improve security and privacy.

   GSMA Association IDM project address operators' requirements for
   emerging mobile application (such as, Single Sign-on, mobile payments
   and other UICC enabled applications).  Several use cases are also
   identified[GSMA_IDM].  Liberty Alliance Telecommunications SIG
   investigates digital identity grown in both telecom and Internet,
   develops several use cases and proposes correspoding solutions for
   interworking these two different domains [TelecoSiG].  Currently some
   use cases [I-D.ietf-abfab-usecases] and architecture
   [I-D.lear-abfab-arch] are developed in IETF abfab working group.

   Inspired by the previous work, this document considers a use case
   which telecom operator acts as Identity provider (IdP) and federates
   with non-Web applications, e.g.  Email, Messaging.  This use case
   combines network stratum access and application stratum access, which
   is named as federated cross-layer access.


2.  Use Case

   Telecom operators have a communication network infrastrure to

   provider users with a wealthy of access methods, such as ADSL
   (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line), 3G (3rd Generation), WLAN
   (Wireless Local Area Network) and Ethernet, etc.  Telecom operator
   has a huge number of registered users, telecom network are trusted
   for users, thus it has a natural advantage to act as an IdP to serve
   for those service providers.

   Take mobile network for example, UE has pre-shared key (PSK) with
   HSS.  UE is mutully authenticated with network during attach
   procedure.  After authentication, a master session key (MSK) is
   created on both UE and AAA.  EAP [RFC3748] can enable the above
   procedure.

   Telecom network supports Web or non-Web application.  In some cases
   user prefers to choose non-Web application, e.g.  Messaging service,
   VoIP, EMail service, etc.  Based on the result of network stratum
   authentication and authorization, user can access applications
   without doing another authentication and authorization procedure.  In
   this way, the system can implement federated cross-layer access.

                  Figure 1: Federated Cross-Layer Access

   Figure 1 shows the relation among UE, network and application.
   Firstly mutual authentication is performed between UE and Network,
   secondly UE accesses Application using Single Sign-ON (SSO) based on
   network stratum's authentication.  In this case, a federation is
   formed between Network and Application.  The brief steps are as
   follows:

   1.  When UE attach the Network, mutual authentication is performed
       master session key is created between them.
   2.  UE visits non-Web Application, e.g Messageing service, VoIP
       service, or Email service.

   3.  Application has no information about the UE.  The Application
       contacts Network to validate the authentication result in the
       network stratum.  Application can find Network according the
       configuration or dynamical discovery protocol.
   4.  Network responds to Application with authentication result.
   5.  UE is authorized to access the Application.

   For federated cross-layer access, Network can assure the Application
   of the authenticity of user's identity, share some of use profile
   with Application.  These can bring some benifits to stakeholders:

   o  For telecom operators, it becomes part of the business value chain
      as an Identity Provider.
   o  For service provider, it can focus on core competitive services
      without worrying about the number of registered users by reusing
      underlying security mechanisms during network stratum access.
   o  For end users, seamless sevice is provided, security and privacy
      are improved.
