                  Protecting The Router Control Plane
             draft-dugal-opsec-protect-control-plane-00.txt

Abstract

   This memo provides a recommendation for protecting a router's control
   plane from undesired or malicious traffic.  In this recommendation,
   all legitimate control plane traffic is identifed.  Once legitimate
   traffic has been identified, a filter is deployed on the router's
   forwarding plane.  That filter prevents traffic not specifically
   identified as legitimate from reaching the router's control plane.
   The examples given are simplified and minimalistic, designed to
   illustrate the concept of protecting the router's control plane.

1.  Introduction

   One of the primary goals of modern core router architecture design is
   to maintain a strict separation of forwarding and control plane
   hardware and software.  Forwarding plane is defined as router
   architecture hardware and software components responsible for taking
   a packet coming in one interface, performing a lookup to identify the
   packet's IP next hop and determine the outgoing interface towards the
   destination, and forwarding the packet through the correct outgoing
   interface.  Control plane supports routing and management functions,
   and is defined as router architecture hardware and software
   components for handling packets destined to the device itself as well
   as building and sending packets originated locally on the device.

   Visually it can be represented as the control plane hardware sitting
   on top of and interfacing with the forwarding plane hardware, with
   interfaces connecting to other network devices.  See Figure 1.

   Typically, forwarding plane functionality is realized in high-
   performance Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that are
   capable of handling frames transit the device at multiple levels of
   magnitude greater load than the control plane hardware.  By contrast,
   the control plane is generally realized in software on general
   purpose processors.  And while software instructions run on both
   planes, the control plane software is usually not optimized for high
   speed packet handling.  ASICs perform well even with high offered
   load, but in most cases control plane hardware can be overwhelmed by
   a DoS attack.  Additionally, the control plane is what drives the
   programming of the forwarding plane.  Therefore, it is imperative
   that the control plane remain stable regardless of traffic load to
   and from the device.

   When compared to forwarding plane functionality, control plane
   functionality is more complex as it has to fully process protocol

   constructs in packets to and from the device versus simply rewriting
   the header of a transit frame to move it from one interface to
   another along the path towards the destination.  The full processing
   of the contents of packets and the function of keeping protocol
   states and machineries result in more potential security
   vulnerabilities as well as a more likely target for a DoS attack
   given the lesser processing power at the control plane level.

   Because the control plane is more susceptible to attacks, it is
   advisable to protect the control plane by implementing mechanisms to
   filter completely or rate limit traffic not required at the control
   plane level (i.e., unwanted traffic).  Control Plane Protection is
   the concept of filtering traffic unwanted traffic which would be
   diverted out of the forwarding plane up to the control plane.  The
   closer to the forwarding plane and line-rate hardware the filters and
   rate-limiters are, the more effective the protection is and the more
   resistent the system is to DoS attacks.  This memo demonstrates how
   to deploy such a filter.


2.  Method

   In this memo, the authors demonstrate how a filter protecting the
   control plane can be deployed.  In Section 3, a sample router
   introduced and all traffic that its control plane must process is
   identified.  In Section 4, filter design concepts are discussed.
   Cisco (Cisco IOS software) and Juniper (JUNOS) implementations are
   provided in Appendices A and B, respectively.


3.  Legitimate Traffic

   In this example, the router control plane must process traffic from
   the following sources:

   o  ICMP traffic from any source, rate-limited

   o  OSPF traffic from routers within own network (network mask
      192.0.2.0/24)

   o  iBGP traffic from routers within own network (network mask
      192.0.2.0/24)

   o  eBGP traffic from known eBGP peers (network addresses
      198.51.100.25, 198.51.100.27, 198.51.100.29, 198.51.100.31)

   o  DNS traffic from local DNS resolvers (198.51.100.0/30)

Internet-Draft            Protect Control Plane             January 2010


   o  NTP traffic from local NTP (198.51.100.4/30)

   o  SSH traffic from network management stations (198.51.100.128/25)

   o  SNMP traffic from network management stations (198.51.100.128/25)

   The characteristics of legitimate traffic will vary from network to
   network.  The list provided above is for example only.


4.  Filter Design

   A filter is installed on the forwarding plane.  This filter counts
   and silently discards all traffic not matching the profile provided
   in Section 3.  Because the filter is enforced on the forwarding
   plane, it prevents unwanted traffic from consuming bandwidth on the
   interface that connects the forwarding plane to the control plane.
   The counters serve as an important forensic tool for the analysis of
   potential attacks, and as an invaluable debugging and troubleshooting
   aid.

   A rate limiter also is installed on the forwarding plane.  The rate
   limiter restricts ICMP traffic bound for the control plane to some
   reasonable volume.  In our example, we will rate limit to 2 Megabits
   per second (Mbps).

   Syntactically, these filters explicitly define "allowed" traffic
   (including IP addresses, protocols, and ports), define acceptable
   actions for these acceptable traffic profiles (e.g., rate-limit or
   simply permit the traffic), and then drop to the bit bucket all
   traffic destined to the control plane but not explicitly allowed.


5.  Security Considerations

   The filter above leaves the router susceptible to discovery from any
   host on the Internet.  If network operators find this risk
   objectionable, they can mitigate it by restricting the sub-networks
   from which ICMP Echo requests are accepted.

   The filter above also leaves the router exposed to port scans from
   hosts spoofing the source addresses found in Section 3.  Network
   operators can mitigate this risk by preventing source address
   spoofing with filters applied at the network edge.  Refer to Section
   5.3.8 of [RFC1812] for more information regarding source address
   validation.

   The ICMP rate limiter specified in this filter protects the router

Internet-Draft            Protect Control Plane             January 2010


   from floods of ICMP traffic.  However, during an ICMP flood, some
   legitimate ICMP traffic may be dropped.  Because of this, when
   operators discover a flood of ICMP traffic, they are highly motivated
   to cut it off at its source.

   The treatment of exception traffic in the forwarding plane, and the
   generation of specific messages by the control plane also requires
   protection from a DoS attack.  Specifically, the generation of ICMP
   Unreachable messages by the control plane needs to be rate-limited,
   either implicitly within the router's architecture or explicitly
   through configuration.  See Section 4.3.2.8 of [RFC1812].
   Additionally, the handling of TTL / Hop Limit expired traffic needs
   protection.  For example, rate limiting the TTL / Hop Limit expired
   traffic before sending the packets to the control plane component
   that will send the ICMP error, and distributing the sending of ICMP
   errors in a Line Card CPU are protection mechanisms that deter
   attacks before a rate limited in the main control plane component.
