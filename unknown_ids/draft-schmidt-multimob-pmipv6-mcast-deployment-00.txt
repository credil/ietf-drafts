Abstract

   This document describes deployment options for activating multicast
   listener functions in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains without modifying
   mobility and multicast protocol standards.  Similar to Home Agents in
   Mobile IPv6, PMIPv6 Local Mobility Anchors serve as multicast
   subscription anchor points, while Mobile Access Gateways provide MLD
   proxy functions.  In this scenario, Mobile Nodes remain agnostic of
   multicast mobility operations.

Internet-Draft        Multicast Listeners in PMIPv6            June 2009


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] extends Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] by
   network-based management functions that enable IP mobility for a host
   without requiring its participation in any mobility-related
   signaling.  Additional network entities, i.e., the Local Mobility
   Anchor (LMA), and Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs), are responsible for
   managing IP mobility on behalf of the mobile node (MN).

   With these routing entities in place, the mobile node looses
   transparent end-to-end connectivity to the static Internet, and in
   the particular case of multicast communication, group membership
   management as signaled by the Multicast Listener Discovery protocol
   [RFC3810], [RFC2710] requires a dedicated treatment, see
   [I-D.deng-multimob-pmip6-requirement].

   Multicast routing functions need a careful placement within the
   PMIPv6 domain to augment unicast transmission with group
   communication services.  [RFC5213] does not explicitly address
   multicast communication, whereas bi-directional home tunneling, the
   minimal multicast support arranged by MIPv6, cannot be applied in
   network-based management scenarios: A mobility-unaware node will
   experience no reason to initiate a tunnel with an entity of mobility
   support.

   This document describes deployment options for activating multicast
   listener functions in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains without modifying
   mobility and multicast protocol standards.  Similar to Home Agents in
   Mobile IPv6, PMIPv6 Local Mobility Anchors serve as multicast
   subscription anchor points, while Mobile Access Gateways provide MLD
   proxy functions.  Mobile Nodes in this scenario remain agnostic of
   multicast mobility operations.  Accrediting the problem space of
   multicast mobility [I-D.irtf-mobopts-mmcastv6-ps], this document does
   not address optimization potentials and efficiency improvements of
   multicast routing in network-centered mobility, as such solutions
   would require changes to the base specification of [RFC5213].


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology as defined for the mobility
   protocols [RFC3775] and [RFC5213], as well as the multicast edge
   related protocols [RFC3810] and [RFC4605].

   The reference scenario for multicast deployment in Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domains is illustrated in Figure 1.

3.  Overview

   An MN in a PMIPv6 domain will decide on multicast group membership
   management completely independent of its current mobility conditions.
   It will submit MLD Report and Done messages following application
   desires, thereby using its link-local source address and multicast
   destinations according to [RFC3810], or [RFC2710].  These link-local
   signaling messages will arrive at the currently active MAG via one of
   its downstream local (wireless) links.  A multicast unaware MAG would
   simply discard these MLD messages.

   To facilitate multicast in a PMIPv6 domain, an MLD proxy function
   [RFC4605] needs to be deployed on the MAG that selects the tunnel



Schmidt, et al.         Expires December 15, 2009               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        Multicast Listeners in PMIPv6            June 2009


   interface corresponding to the MN's LMA for its upstream interface
   (cf., section 6 of [RFC5213]).  Thereby each LMA upstream interface
   defines an MLD proxy domain at the MAG, containing all downstream
   links to MNs that share this LMA.  MLD signaling of the MN will be
   consequently forwarded up the tunnel interface to its corresponding
   LMA.

   Serving as the designated multicast router or an additional MLD
   proxy, the LMA will transpose any MLD messages of the MN into the
   multicast routing infrastructure.  Correspondingly, the LMA will
   implement appropriate multicast forwarding states at its tunnel
   interface.  Traffic arriving for groups under subscription will
   arrive at the LMA, which it will forward according to all its group/
   source states.  In addition, the LMA will naturally act as an MLD
   querier, seeing its downstream tunnel interfaces as multicast enabled
   links.

   At the MAG, MLD queries and multicast data will arrive on the
   (tunnel) interface that is assigned to a group of access links as
   identified by its Binding Update List (cf., section 6 of [RFC5213]).
   As specified for MLD proxies, the MAG will forward multicast traffic
   and related signaling down the appropriate access links to the MNs.
   In proceeding this way, all multicast-related signaling and the
   corresponding traffic will transparently flow from the LMA to the MN
   on an LMA-specific shared tree.

   In case of a mobility handover, the (IP mobility unaware) MN will
   refrain from submitting unsolicited MLD reports.  Instead, the LMA is
   required to maintain group memberships in the following way.  On the
   reception of a Proxy Binding Update (PBU) from the new MAG and
   successful Re-Binding, the LMA re-establishes a route to the MN's
   home network prefix over the tunnel interface corresponding to the
   new MAG (cf., section 5.3 of [RFC5213]).

   After Re-Binding, the LMA SHOULD issue a general MLD query on the new
   tunnel link to refresh forwarding requirements.  Queries can be
   omitted, if multicast forwarding states previously established at the
   tunnel interface towards the new MAG form a superset of those present
   at the old tunnel interface.  The LMA SHOULD likewise perform a
   general MLD query after receiving a Binding De-Registration at a
   tunnel interface that is to be maintained.  The LMA MAY reduce the
   need for queries when it applies explicit tracking in combination
   with [RFC3810].

   These multicast deployment considerations likewise apply for mobile
   nodes that operate with its IPv4 stack enabled in a PMIPv6 domain.
   PMIPv6 can provide an IPv4 home address mobility support
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].  Such mobile node will use

   IGMPv3 [RFC3376] signaling for multicast, which is handled by an IGMP
   proxy function at the MAG in an analogous way.

   Following these deployment steps, multicast management transparently
   interoperates with PMIPv6.  It is worth noting that multicast streams
   can possibly be distributed on redundant path, leading to duplicate
   traffic arriving from different LMAs at one MAG, and causing multiple
   data transmissions from a MAG over one wireless domain to different
   MNs.


4.  Deployment Details

   Multicast activation in a PMIPv6 domain requires to deploy general
   multicast functions at PMIPv6 routers and to define its interaction
   with the PMIPv6 protocol in the following way:

4.1.  Operations of the Mobile Node

   A Mobile Node willing to manage multicast traffic will join, maintain
   and leave groups as if located in the fixed Internet.  No specific
   mobility actions nor implementations are required at the MN.

4.2.  Operations of the Mobile Access Gateway

   A Mobility Access Gateway is required to assist in MLD signaling and
   data forwarding between the MNs which it serves, and the
   corresponding LMAs associated to each MN.  It therefore needs to
   implement an instance of the MLD proxy function [RFC4605] for each
   upstream tunnel interface that has been established with an LMA.  The
   MAG decides on the mapping of downstream links to a proxy instance
   (and hence an upstream link to an LMA) based on the regular Binding
   Update List as maintained by PMIPv6 standard operations (cf., section
   6.1 of [RFC5213]).

   On the reception of MLD reports from an MN, the MAG MUST identify the
   corresponding proxy instance from the incoming interface and perform
   regular MLD proxy operations: it will insert/update/remove a
   multicast forwarding state on the incoming interface and forward the
   report to its upstream tunnel.  Conversely on the reception of MLD
   queries, the MAG proxy instance will transfer the queries to its
   appropriate downstream interfaces.  Multicast traffic arriving on an
   upstream interface at the MAG will be forwarded according to the
   group/source-specific forwarding states as acquired for each
   downstream interface within the MLD proxy instance.

   In case of a mobility handover, the MAG will continue to manage
   upstream tunnels and downstream interfaces as foreseen in the PMIPv6



Schmidt, et al.         Expires December 15, 2009               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Multicast Listeners in PMIPv6            June 2009


   specification.  However, it MUST assure consistency of its up- and
   downstream interfaces that change under mobility with MLD proxy
   instances and its multicast forwarding states.

   In proceeding this way, the MAG is entitled to aggregate multicast
   subscriptions for each of its MLD proxy instances.  However, this
   deployment approach does not prevent multiple identical streams
   arriving from different LMA upstream interfaces.  Furthermore, a per
   group forwarding into the wireless domain is restricted to the link
   model in use.

4.3.  Operations of the Local Mobility Anchor

   For any MN, the Local Mobility Anchor acts as the persistent Home
   Agent and at the same time as the default multicast querier.  It
   implements the function of the designated multicast router or a
   further MLD proxy.  According to MLD reports received from MNs (via
   MAGs), it establishes/maintains/removes group/source-specific
   multicast forwarding states at its downstream tunnel interfaces
   established with MAGs, and at the same time procures for aggregated
   multicast membership maintenance at its upstream interface.  Based on
   the multicast-transparent operations of the MAGs, the LMA experiences
   its tunnel interfaces as multicast enabled downstream links serving
   zero to many listening nodes.  Multicast traffic arriving at the LMA
   is transparently forwarded according to its multicast forwarding
   states.  The LMA MAY choose to apply explicit node tracking in
   combination with MLDv2 [RFC3810].

   On the occurrence of a mobility handover, the LMA will receive
   Binding Lifetime De-Registrations and Binding Lifetime Extensions
   that will cause a re-mapping of home network prefixes to Proxy-CoAs
   in its Binding Cache.  Correspondingly, the multicast forwarding
   states require updating, as well.  In the absence of explicit
   tracking, the LMA MUST proceed as follows:

   o  Issue a general multicast query on a tunnel interface that is to
      be maintained even though a De-Registration was received.  Update
      the multicast forwarding states according to the query outcome.

   o  Issue a general multicast query on a tunnel interface at which a
      Lifetime Extension was received from a new Proxy-CoA, if the
      multicast forwarding states at this interface do not form a
      superset of the states established at the interface corresponding
      to the previous Proxy-CoA.

   For multicast membership queries, two cases need distinction:

Internet-Draft        Multicast Listeners in PMIPv6            June 2009


   1.  LMA multicast membership maintenance is unaffected by the
       handover-related absence of the MN: In this case, the LMA
       actively maintains states and continues to transmit multicast
       packets to the down-tunnel towards the MN.  The PMIPv6 protocol
       will transfer the tunnel endpoints and access link binding states
       between previous and new MAG, such that the MN can simply
       continue to receive its group traffic under subscription.
       Service interruptions are bound to the handover discontinuities
       experienced for PMIPv6 unicast transmission.

   2.  A MN may be unable to answer LMA multicast membership queries due
       to handover procedures.  Such instance is equivalent to a general
       query loss.  To prevent erroneous query timeouts at the LMA, MLD
       parameters SHOULD be carefully adjusted to the mobility regime.
       In particular, MLD timers and the Robustness Variable (see
       section 9 of [RFC3810]) MUST be chosen to be compliant with the
       temporal handover operations of the PMIPv6 domain.

   In proceeding this way, each LMA will provide transparent multicast
   support for the group of MNs it serves.  It will perform traffic
   aggregation at the MN-group level and will assure that multicast data
   streams are uniquely forwarded per individual LMA-to-MAG tunnel.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


6.  Security Considerations

   This draft does neither introduce additional messages nor novel
   protocol operations.  Consequently, no new threats arrive from
   procedures described in this document in excess to [RFC3810] and
   [RFC5213] security concerns.
