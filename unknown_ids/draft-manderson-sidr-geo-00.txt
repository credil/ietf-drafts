2.  Introduction

   There is a constant an ongoing effort to investigate and analyse the
   global internet routing system from many different perspectives.  One
   perspective is related to the geographical position of BGP [RFC4271]
   speakers and the terrestrial location of the route propagation.
   Recording of such information by passive BGP listeners in MRT format
   is described in the MRT BGP routing information export format with
   geo-location extensions [I-D.ietf-grow-geomrt].  There are of course
   many other efforts external to the IETF and won't be described here.
   Further awareness of these efforts is left to the reader.

   This document describes the construction, use, and interpretation of
   the RPKI-GEO record.  This record provides first class informational
   attestations pertaining to the geographical attributes relating to
   the information described in RPKI objects.  The use of the
   geographical data is of an informational nature and provides a
   consistent and validatable approach to asserting the location
   properties of any item described by an RPKI object.  To maintain
   consistency implementers and readers should condier the 9 rules in
   section 3 of [RFC5491].

   It is not intended that the RPKI object described herein be used to
   directly influence routing or forwarding decisions.  Its creation by
   any certificate maintainer is to be interpreted as informational and
   any replying party should only use the knowledge in the efforts of
   routing research or anomaly detection.

   The geographic attestations made in this object are made by the
   certificate maintainer and their validity and accuracy is in the
   hands of the certificate maintainer.  It is left to the relying party
   as how much trust is given to the geographic data provided by the
   certificate maintainer.

   The RPKI-GEO object pertains only to the objects at the same RPKI
   repository publication point where it itself is published.

3.  Suggested Reading

   The assumption is made that the reader comprehends the RPKI, the RPKI
   Repository Structure, and the various RPKI objects described in the
   following: [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch], [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs],
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object], [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-format],
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-manifests], [I-D.ietf-sidr-ghostbusters].

4.  RPKI-GEO Structure

   The structure of the GEO-RPKI object follows the description and the
   generic RPKI validation as described in Signed Object Template for
   the Resource  Public Key Infrastructure [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object]

4.1.  CMS Packaging

   The eContentType of the RPKI-GEO object in the encapContentInfo
   (signed content) section of object is defined as rpkiGEO with the
   numerical value of TO BE ASSIGNED.

4.2.  eContent

   The content of a RPKI-GEO object identifies an RPKI object and the
   geographical coordinates associated with the item described by the
   RPKI object.

   The ASN.1 for the RPKI-GEO object is as follows:


   rPKIGEO ::= SEQUENCE {
           Version       [0] INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
           geoLocs SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF geoOBJECTS
           }

   geoObjects ::= SEQUENCE {
       objectFile          FileAndHash,
       geoAttribs          SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF geoXML
       }

   FileAndHash ::=     SEQUENCE {
       file            IA5String,
       hash            BIT STRING
       }

   geoXML ::= SEQUENCE {
      type   INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
      xmlDoc PrintableString
   }


4.3.  RPKI-GEO data elements

4.3.1.  Version

   The version number of this version of the GEO-RPKI object MUST be 0.

Internet-Draft      Geo-Location information for RPKI      February 2011


4.3.2.  geoLocs

   This field is a sequence of geoObjects.  Each geoObject contains a
   FileAndHash element and a sequence of geoXML.  The geoLoc object MUST
   contain at least one geoXML object of type 0 for each FileAndHash
   element

4.3.3.  FileAndHash

   The single FileAndHash entry in each geoObject corresponds to each
   currently valid signed object that has been published by the
   authority (at this publication point).  The description is as seen in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-manifests]: Each FileAndHash is an ordered pair
   consisting of the name of the file in the repository publication
   point that contains the object in question, and a hash of the file's
   contents.

   The publication point manifest and RPKI-GEO object's FileAndHash MUST
   NOT appear in a RPKI-GEO object.

4.3.4.  geoXML

   The geoXML contains the details of the geographical location
   information in an xml representation defined by the geoXML type
   value.  The type specifies the XML schema used in the xmlDoc portion.
   There are 2 valid types.


           Type 0: A GML syntax
           Type 1: A Civic Address Syntax

                            geoXML schema types

4.3.4.1.  Type 0

   Type 0 is a constrained GML syntax [GML].  The constraints on the
   syntax are as follows.

   Coordinate datum selection: The coordinates used in the GML will use
   the WGS84 datum [WGS84].  Any use of another datum specified in the
   GML in this object is considered illegal.  This is for compatibility
   and uniformity.

   The XML contained on the xmlDoc geoXML element for type = 0 MUST
   contain only one GML reference of either point or polygon
   representations.

                     geoXML Type 0 xmlDoc GML example

4.3.4.2.  Type 1

   A Type 1 xmlDoc contains a Civic address representation of the
   location information and is defined in [RFC5139].

5.  RPKI-GEO Validation

   After the generic signed objects validation
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object] has been performed, the Version number
   field within the payload is checked.  The payload data is checked
   against the profile defined in this document.  All of these checks
   MUST pass for the RPKI-GEO payload to be considered valid and made
   available for use.

6.  RPKI-GEO interpretation

   A common sense interpretation of location data should prevail based
   on the type of the data that is represented in the RPKI object.  For
   example a RPKI-GEO object that provides location information for a
   ROA would attest to the geographical location where the route is
   originated from.  That may be the originating BGP speaker(s) as
   described in [I-D.ietf-grow-geomrt].  Similarly the location
   information associated with a Ghostbusters record
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-ghostbusters] would describe the geographical location
   of the entity described in the Ghostbusters VCARD.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to add the .geo extention to the RPKI
   file extension namespace.

8.  Security Considerations

   The RPKI object described here is used in a descriptive nature and
   provide information that is useful in the analysis of routing
   systems.  As such, the authors believes that it does not constitute
   an additional security risk.  It is recommended that the issuers of
   the GEO-RPKI objects consider their own privacy concerns before
   supplying geographical coordinates in the RPKI.
