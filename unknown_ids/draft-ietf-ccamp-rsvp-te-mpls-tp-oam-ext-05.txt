1.  Introduction

   This document describes the configuration of pro-active MPLS-TP
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Functions for a
   given LSP using a common set of TLVs carried on RSVP-TE [RFC3209].
   In particular it specifies the mechanisms necessary to establish
   MPLS-TP OAM entities monitoring an LSP and defines information
   elements and procedures to configure pro-active MPLS OAM functions.
   Initialization and control of on-demand MPLS OAM functions are
   expected to be carried out by directly accessing network nodes via a
   management interface; hence configuration and control of on-demand
   OAM functions are out-of-scope for this document.

   Pro-active MPLS OAM is based on the Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection (BFD) protocol [RFC5880].  Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection (BFD), as described in [RFC5880], defines a protocol that
   provides low- overhead, short-duration detection of failures in the
   path between two forwarding engines, including the interfaces, data
   link(s), and to the extent possible the forwarding engines
   themselves.  BFD can be used to track the liveliness and detect data
   plane failures of MPLS-TP point-to-point and might also be extended
   to p2mp connections.

   MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) describes a profile of MPLS that
   enables operational models typical in transport networks, while
   providing additional OAM, survivability and other maintenance
   functions not currently supported by MPLS.  [RFC5860] defines the
   requirements for the OAM functionality of MPLS-TP.

   BFD has been chosen to be the basis of pro-active MPLS-TP OAM
   functions.  MPLS-TP OAM extensions for transport applications, for
   which this document specifies the configuration, are specified in
   [BFD-CCCV], [MPLS-PM], and [MPLS-FMS].

1.3.  Overview of BFD OAM operation

   BFD is a simple hello protocol that in many respects is similar to
   the detection components of well-known routing protocols.  A pair of
   systems transmits BFD packets periodically over each path between the
   two systems, and if a system stops receiving BFD packets for long
   enough, some component in that particular bidirectional path to the
   neighboring system is assumed to have failed.  Systems may also
   negotiate to not send periodic BFD packets in order to reduce
   overhead.

   A path is only declared to be operational when two-way communication
   has been established between systems, though this does not preclude
   the use of unidirectional links to support bidirectional paths (co-
   routed or bidirectional or associated bidirectional).

   Each system estimates how quickly it can send and receive BFD packets
   in order to come to an agreement with its neighbor about how rapidly
   detection of failure will take place.  These estimates can be
   modified in real time in order to adapt to unusual situations.  This
   design also allows for fast systems on a shared medium with a slow
   system to be able to more rapidly detect failures between the fast
   systems while allowing the slow system to participate to the best of
   its ability.  However, in some cases one may want to configure these
   timers manually, in those cases the TLVs defined in this document can
   be used.

   The ability of each system to control the BFD packet transmission
   rate in both directions provides a mechanism for congestion control,
   particularly when BFD is used across multiple network hops.

   As recommended in [BFD-CCCV], the BFD tool needs to be extended for
   the proactive CV functionality by the addition of an unique
   identifier in order to meet the requirements.  The document in [BFD-
   CCCV] specifies the BFD extension and behavior to meet the
   requirements for MPLS-TP proactive Continuity Check and Connectivity
   Verification functionality and the RDI functionality as defined in
   [RFC5860].


2.  Overview of MPLS OAM for Transport Applications

   [MPLS-TP-OAM-FWK] describes how MPLS OAM mechanisms are operated to
   meet transport requirements outlined in [RFC5860].

   [BFD-CCCV] specifies two BFD operation modes: 1) "CC mode", which
   uses periodic BFD message exchanges with symmetric timer settings,
   supporting Continuity Check, 2) "CV/CC mode" which sends unique



Bellagamba, et al.     Expires September 11, 2011               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       Extensions for MPLS-TP OAM Conf          March 2011


   maintenance entity identifiers in the periodic BFD messages
   supporting Connectivity Verification as well as Continuity Check.

   [MPLS-PM] specifies mechanisms for performance monitoring of LSPs, in
   particular it specifies loss and delay measurement OAM functions.

   [MPLS-FMS] specifies fault management signals with which a server LSP
   can notify client LSPs about various fault conditions to suppress
   alarms or to be used as triggers for actions in the client LSPs.  The
   following signals are defined: Alarm Indication Signal (AIS), Link
   Down Indication (LDI) and Locked Report (LKR).  To indicate client
   faults associated with the attachment circuits Client Signal Failure
   Indication (CSF) can be used.  CSF is described in [MPLS-TP-OAM-FWK]
   and in the context of this document is for further study.

   [MPLS-TP-OAM-FWK] describes the mapping of fault conditions to
   consequent actions.  Some of these mappings may be configured by the
   operator, depending on the application of the LSP.  The following
   defects are identified: Loss Of Continuity (LOC), Misconnectivity,
   MEP Misconfiguration and Period Misconfiguration.  Out of these
   defect conditions, the following consequent actions may be
   configurable: 1) whether or not the LOC defect should result in
   blocking the outgoing data traffic; 2) whether or not the "Period
   Misconfiguration defect" should result a signal fail condition.


3.  Theory of Operations

3.1.  MPLS OAM Configuration Operation Overview

   RSVP-TE, or in alternative LSP Ping [LSP-PING CONF], can be used to
   simply establish (i.e., bootstrap) a BFD session or it can
   selectively enable and configure all pro-active MPLS OAM functions.
   For this specification, BFD MUST be run in asynchronous mode and both
   sides should be in active mode.

   In the simplest scenario RSVP-TE, or in alternative LSP Ping [LSP-
   PING CONF], is used only to bootstrap the BFD session.  In this case
   the initiating node includes an "OAM Configuration TLV" in the
   message it sends to the receiving node at the other end of the LSP.
   The OAM Type in the "OAM Configuration TLV" is set to "MPLS OAM", the
   CC OAM Function flag is set, and a "BFD Configuration sub-TLV" is
   included.  The sub-TLV carries a "Local Discriminator sub-TLV" with
   the discriminator value selected by the initiating node for the BFD
   session associated with the LSP.  The N flag in the "BFD
   Configuration sub-TLV" MUST be set to enable timer negotiation/
   re-negotiation via BFD Control Messages.

Internet-Draft       Extensions for MPLS-TP OAM Conf          March 2011


   The receiving node MUST use the Local Discriminator value it receives
   to identify the remote end of the BFD session.  The receiving node
   must send a message to the initiating node that includes an "OAM
   Configuration TLV" containing the same values as it received, except
   for the "Local Discriminator sub-TLV", which contains the local
   discriminator value selected by the receiving node for the BFD
   session.

   Timer negotiation is performed in subsequent BFD control messages.
   This operation is similar to LSP Ping based bootstrapping described
   in [RFC5884].

   If timer negotiation is to be done using the TLVs defined in this
   document rather than with BFD Control packets, the N flag MUST be
   cleared and a "Timer Negotiation Parameters sub-TLV" MUST be present
   in the "BFD Configuration sub-TLV".  In this case, there are two
   configuration options, symmetric and asymmetric.  If symmetric
   configuration is used, the S flag in "BFD Configuration sub-TLV" MUST
   be set.  If the flag is cleared, the configuration is completed
   asymmetrically in the two directions.  Section 3.3.2 includes a
   detailed explanation of such configuration.

   In the case of the "CV/CC mode" OAM [BFD-CCCV], the "CV" flag MUST be
   set in addition to the CC flag in the "OAM Configuration TLV".  The
   information required to support this functionality is defined in
   [MPLS-TP-IDENTIF].  If RSVP-TE is used, this information is found
   respectively in the SESSION and SENDER_TEMPLATE object with no need
   of additional sub-TLVs as described in section 3.2.

   When BFD Control packets are transported in the G-ACh they are not
   protected by any end-to-end checksum, only lower-layers are providing
   error detection/correction.  A single bit error, e.g. a flipped bit
   in the BFD State field could cause the receiving end to wrongly
   conclude that the link is down and thus trigger protection switching.
   To prevent this from happening the "BFD Configuration sub-TLV" has an
   Integrity flag that when set enables BFD Authentication using Keyed
   SHA1 with an empty key (all 0s) [RFC5880].  This would make every BFD
   Control packet carry an SHA1 hash of itself that can be used to
   detect errors.

   If BFD Authentication using a shared key / password is desired (i.e.
   actual authentication not only error detection) the "BFD
   Authentication sub-TLV" MUST be included in the "BFD Configuration
   sub-TLV".  The "BFD Authentication sub-TLV" is used to specify which
   authentication method that should be used and which shared key /
   password that should be used for this particular session.  How the
   key exchange is performed is out of scope of this document.

   Additional OAM functions may be configured by setting the appropriate
   flags in the "OAM Functions TLV", these include Performance
   Measurements (packet loss and packet delay) and Fault Management
   Signal handling.

   By setting the PM Loss flag in the "OAM Functions TLV" and including
   the "MPLS OAM PM Loss sub-TLV" one can configure the measurement
   interval and loss threshold values for triggering protection.

   Delay measurements are configured by setting PM Delay flag in the
   "OAM Functions TLV" and including the "MPLS OAM PM Loss sub-TLV" one
   can configure the measurement interval and the delay threshold values
   for triggering protection.

   To configure Fault Monitoring Signals and their refresh time the FMS
   flag in the "OAM Functions TLV" MUST be set and the "MPLS OAM FMS
   sub-TLV" included.

3.2.  OAM Configuration TLV

   The "OAM Configuration TLV" is depicted in the following figure.  It
   specifies the OAM functions that are to be used for the subject LSP
   and it is defined in [OAM-CONF-FWK].  The "OAM Configuration TLV" is
   carried in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object in Path and Resv messages.

   IANA to assign) from the "RSVP-TE OAM Configuration Registry".  The

   "MPLS OAM" type is set to request the establishment of OAM functions
   for MPLS-TP LSPs.  The specific OAM functions are specified in the
   "Function Flags" sub-TLV as depicted in [OAM-CONF-FWK].

   The receiving edge LSR when the MPLS-TP OAM Type is requested should
   check which OAM Function Flags are set in the "Function Flags TLV"
   and look for the corresponding technology specific configuration TLV.

   Additional corresponding sub-TLVs are as follows:

      - "BFD Configuration sub-TLV", which MUST be included if the CC
      OAM Function flag is set.  This sub-TLV MUST carry a "BFD Local
      Discriminator sub-TLV" and a "Timer Negotiation Parameters sub-
      TLV" if the N flag is cleared.  It MAY carry a "BFD Authentication
      sub-TLV" if the I flag is set.  If the I flag is set but no "BFD
      Authentication sub-TLV" is included Keyed SHA1 with an empty key
      is used.

      - "MPLS OAM PM Loss sub-TLV", which MAY be included if the PM/Loss
      OAM Function flag is set.  If the "MPLS OAM PM Loss sub-TLV" is
      not included, default configuration values are used.

      - "MPLS OAM PM Delay sub-TLV", which MAY be included if the PM/
      Delay OAM Function flag is set.  If the "MPLS OAM PM Delay sub-
      TLV" is not included, default configuration values are used.

      - "MPLS OAM FMS sub-TLV", which MAY be included if the FMS OAM
      Function flag is set.  If the "MPLS OAM FMS sub-TLV" is not
      included, default configuration values are used.

   Moreover, if the CV flag is set, the CC flag MUST be set at the same
   time.  The format of an MPLS-TP CV/CC message is shown in [BFD-CCCV]
   and it requires, together with the BFD control packet information,
   the "Unique MEP-ID of source of BFD packet".  [MPLS-TP-IDENTIF]
   defines the composition of such identifier as:

   <"Unique MEP-ID of source of BFD packet"> ::=
   <src_node_id><src_tunnel_num><lsp_num>

   GMPLS signaling [RFC3473] uses a 5-tuple to uniquely identify an LSP
   within an operator's network.  This tuple is composed of a Tunnel
   Endpoint Address, Tunnel_ID, Extended Tunnel ID, and Tunnel Sender
   Address and (GMPLS) LSP_ID.

   Hence, the following mapping is used without the need of redefining a
   new TLV for MPLS-TP proactive CV purpose.

      - Tunnel ID = src_tunnel_num

      - Tunnel Sender Address = src_node_id

      - LSP ID = LSP_Num

   "Tunnel ID" and "Tunnel Sender Address" are included in the "SESSION"
   object [RFC3209], which is mandatory in both Path and Resv messages.

   "LSP ID" will be the same on both directions and it is included in
   the "SENDER_TEMPLATE" object [RFC3209] which is mandatory in Path
   messages.

   [Author's note: the same "Unique MEP-ID of source" will be likely
   required for Performance monitoring purposes.  However for the moment
   in [MPLS-PM] it is stated: "The question of ACH TLV usage and the
   manner of supporting metadata such as authentication keys and node
   identifiers is deliberately omitted.  These issues will be addressed
   in a future version of the document."]

3.3.  BFD Configuration sub-TLV

   The "BFD Configuration sub-TLV" (depicted below) is defined for BFD
   OAM specific configuration parameters.  The "BFD Configuration sub-
   TLV" is carried as a sub-TLV of the "OAM Configuration TLV".

   This TLV accommodates generic BFD OAM information and carries sub-
   TLVs.

   Acceptable Min. Asynchronous TX interval: in case of S (symmetric)
   flag set in the "BFD Configuration sub-TLV", it expresses the desired
   time interval (in microseconds) at which the LER initiating the
   signaling intends to both transmit and receive BFD periodic control
   packets.  If the receiving edge LSR can not support such value, it is
   allowed to reply back with an interval greater than the one proposed.

   In case of S (symmetric) flag cleared in the "BFD Configuration sub-
   TLV", this field expresses the desired time interval (in
   microseconds) at which a edge LSR intends to transmit BFD periodic
   control packets in its transmitting direction.

   Acceptable Min. Asynchronous RX interval: in case of S (symmetric)
   flag set in the "BFD Configuration sub-TLV", this field MUST be equal
   to "Acceptable Min. Asynchronous TX interval" and has no additional
   meaning respect to the one described for "Acceptable Min.
   Asynchronous TX interval".

   In case of S (symmetric) flag cleared in the "BFD Configuration sub-
   TLV", it expresses the minimum time interval (in microseconds) at
   which edge LSRs can receive BFD periodic control packets.  In case
   this value is greater than the "Acceptable Min. Asynchronous TX
   interval" received from the other edge LSR, such edge LSR MUST adopt
   the interval expressed in this "Acceptable Min. Asynchronous RX
   interval".

   Required Echo TX Interval: the minimum interval (in microseconds)
   between received BFD Echo packets that this system is capable of
   supporting, less any jitter applied by the sender as described in
   [RFC5880] sect. 6.8.9.  This value is also an indication for the
   receiving system of the minimum interval between transmitted BFD Echo
   packets.  If this value is zero, the transmitting system does not
   support the receipt of BFD Echo packets.  If the receiving system can
   not support this value an error MUST be generated "Unsupported BFD TX
   rate interval".

   Detection time multiplier: The negotiated transmit interval,
   multiplied by this value, provides the Detection Time for the
   receiving system in Asynchronous mode.

   considerations to those discussed in [RFC3473].  In particular, a
   network element could be overloaded, if an attacker would request
   liveliness monitoring, with frequent periodic messages, for a high
   number of LSPs, targeting a single network element.

   Security aspects will be covered in more detailed in subsequent
   versions of this document.
