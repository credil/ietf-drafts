Internet-Draft         64 Multicast Address Format             June 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an extension to the multicast IPv6 addressing
   architecture [RFC4291].  This extension is used for building IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 multicast addresses.

   This specification can be used in conjunction with other extensions
   such as building unicast prefix-based multicast IPv6 address
   [RFC3306] or embedding the rendezvous point [RFC3956].

   This document updates [RFC6052] which focuses exclusively on IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 unicast addresses.

   More discussion about issues related to IPv4/IPv6 multicast can be
   found at [I-D.jaclee-behave-v4v6-mcast-ps].

1.1.  Scope

   The address format defined in this document applies for both IPv4-
   IPv6 translation and encapsulation schemes.

   It is out of scope of this document to define the overall procedure
   for the delivery of IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast to the requesting
   receivers.  Practical details about the procedure is defined in
   specific documents such as [I-D.venaas-behave-v4v6mc-framework] and
   [I-D.qin-softwire-dslite-multicast].


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address: denotes a multicast IPv6
      address which includes in 32 bits an IPv4 address.  Two types of
      IPv6 addresses are defined that carry an IPv4 address in the low-
      order 32 bits of the address.  The format to build such addresses
      is defined in Section 7 for ASM mode and Section 8 for SSM mode.

   o  IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function: refers to a function which is
      enabled in a node interconnecting an IPv4-enabled domain with an
      IPv6-enabled one.

         An IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function can be implemented using
         encapsulation or translation techniques.

         It can be located in various places of the multicast network;
         it is deployment-specific issue left to operators.
         Particularly, in terms of multicast control message, it can be

Internet-Draft         64 Multicast Address Format             June 2011


         an IGMP/MLD Interworking Function or an IPv4-IPv6 PIM
         Interworking Function.  Since from the protocol perspective,
         the MLD protocol [RFC3810] is a translation of IGMP [RFC3376]
         in the semantics of IPv6 and PIM [RFC4601] has been designed to
         accommodate both IPv4 and IPv6, no extra functionality is
         needed to be defined, but to follow the address format
         specified in Section 7 for ASM mode and Section 8 for SSM mode.
         In terms of multicast traffic forwarding, it can be
         translation-based or encapsulation-based.

   o  Multicast Prefix64 (or MPREFIX64 for short) refers to an IPv6
      multicast prefix to be used to construct IPv4-embedded IPv6
      multicast addresses.

   o  ASM_MPREFIX64: denotes a multicast Prefix64 used in ASM mode
      (Section 7).

   o  SSM_MPREFIX64: denotes a multicast Prefix64 used in SSM mode
      (Section 8).


3.  Motivations

   Recently various solutions (e.g.,
   [I-D.venaas-behave-v4v6mc-framework],
   [I-D.xu-softwire-mesh-multicast],
   [I-D.qin-softwire-dslite-multicast],
   [I-D.sarikaya-behave-netext-nat64-pmip] or
   [I-D.sarikaya-behave-mext-nat64-dsmip]) have been proposed to allow
   access to IPv4 multicast content from hosts attached to IPv6-enabled
   domains.

   Even if these solutions have distinct applicability scopes
   (translation vs. encapsulation) and target different use cases, they
   all make use of specific IPv6 multicast addresses to embed an IPv4
   multicast address.  Particularly, the IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
   address is used as a destination IPv6 address of multicast flows
   received from an IPv4-enabled domain and injected by the IPv4-IPv6
   Interconnection Function into an IPv6-enabled domain.  It is also
   used to build an IPv6 multicast state (*, G6) or (S6, G6)
   corresponding to their (*, G4) or (S4, G4) IPv4 counter parts by the
   IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function.

   This document aims at harmonizing the definition of an IPv4-embedded
   IPv6 address format.

4.  Why an Address Format is Needed for Multicast IPv4-IPv6
    Interconnection?

   Arguments why an IPv6 address format is needed to embed multicast
   IPv4 address are quite similar to those of [RFC6052].  Concretely,
   the definition of a multicast address format embedding a multicast
   IPv4 address allows:

   o  Stateless IPv4-IPv6 header translation of multicast flows;

   o  Stateless IPv4-IPv6 PIM interworking function;

   o  Stateless IGMP-MLD interworking function (e.g., required for an
      IPv4 receiver to access to IPv4 multicast content via an IPv6
      network);

   o  Stateless (local) synthesis of IPv6 address when IPv4 multicast
      address are embedded in application payload (e.g., SDP [RFC4566]);

   o  Except the provisioning of the same MPREFIX64, no coordination is
      required between IPv4-IPv6 PIM interworking function, IGMP-MLD
      interworking function, IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function and any
      ALG (Application Level Gateway) in the path;

   o  Minimal operational constraints on the multicast address
      management: IPv6 multicast addresses can be constructed using what
      has been deployed for IPv4 delivery mode.


5.  Why Identifying an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Address is Required?

   Reserving an M-bit in the IPv6 multicast address (which is equivalent
   to reserving a dedicated multicast block for IPv4-IPv6
   interconnection purposes) is a means to guide the address selection
   process at the receiver side; in particular it assists the receiver
   to select the appropriate IP multicast address while avoiding to
   involve an IPv4-IPv6 interconnection function in the path.

   Two use cases to illustrate this behavior are provided below:

   1.  An ALG is required to help an IPv6 receiver to select the
       appropriate IP address when only the IPv4 address is advertised
       (e.g., using SDP); otherwise the access to the IPv4 multicast
       content can not be offered to the IPv6 receiver.  The ALG may be
       located downstream the receiver.  As such, the ALG does not know
       in advance whether the receiver is dual-stack or IPv6-only.  The
       ALG may be tuned to insert both the original IPv4 address and
       corresponding IPv6 multicast address using for instance the ALTC

Internet-Draft         64 Multicast Address Format             June 2011


       SDP attribute [I-D.boucadair-mmusic-altc].  If the M-bit is not
       used, a dual-stack receiver may prefer to use the IPv6 address to
       receive the multicast content.  This address selection would
       require multicast flows to cross an IPv4-IPv6 interconnection
       function.

   2.  In order to avoid involving an ALG in the path, an IPv4-only
       source can advertise both its IPv4 address and IPv4-embedded IPv6
       multicast address using for instance the ALTC SDP attribute.  If
       the M-bit is not used, a dual-stack receiver may prefer to use
       the IPv6 address to receive the multicast content.  This address
       selection would require multicast flows to cross an IPv4-IPv6
       interconnection function.

   Reserving an M-bit in the IPv6 multicast address for IPv4-IPv6
   interconnection purposes mitigates the issues discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-nat64-learn-analysis] in a multicast context.


6.  Design Choices

6.1.  Location of the IPv4 Address

   There is no strong argument to allow for flexible options to encode
   the IPv4 address inside the multicast IPv6 address.  The option
   retained by the authors is to encode the multicast IPv4 address in
   the low-order 32 bits of the IPv6 address.

   This choice is also motivated by the need to be compliant with
   [RFC3306] and [RFC3956].

6.2.  Location of the M-bit

   Figure 1 is a reminder of the IPv6 multicast address format as
   defined in [RFC4291]:

       Figure 1: IPv6 Multicast address format as defined in RFC4291

   It was tempting to use the remaining flag to indicate whether an IPv6
   address embeds an IPv4 address or not.  This choice has been
   abandoned by the authors for various reasons:

   o  ff3x::/32 is defined as SSM.  Defining a new flag would require
      standards and implementations to also treat ffbx::/32 as SSM.

   o  Prefixes starting with ff7x are defined as embedded-RP, but not
      prefixes starting with fffx.  Blow is provided an excerpt from
      [RFC3956]:

         " ...the encoding and the protocol mode used when the two high-
         order bits in "flgs" are set to 11 ("FFF0::/12") is
         intentionally unspecified until such time that the highest-
         order bit is defined.  Without further IETF specification,
         implementations SHOULD NOT treat the FFF0::/12 range as
         Embedded-RP."

         as such defining a new flag would require implementations to
         also treat ff7x::/12 as embedded-RP prefix.

   o  This is the last remaining flag and at this stage we are not sure
      whether there is other usage scenarios of the flag.

   As a conclusion, the remaining flag is not used to indicate an IPv6
   multicast address embeds an IPv4 multicast address.  However the
   following constraints should be met:

      (1) Belong to ff3x::/32 and be compatible with unicast-based
      prefix [RFC3306] for SSM.  Note that [RFC3306] suggests to set
      "plen" to 0 and "network-prefix" to 0.

      (2) Be compatible with embedded-RP [RFC3956] and unicast-based
      prefix [RFC3306] for ASM;

Internet-Draft         64 Multicast Address Format             June 2011


      (3) Avoid ff3x::4000:0001-ff3x::7fff:ffff which is reserved for
      IANA.

   Meeting (1) and (2) with the same location of the M-bit is not
   feasible without modifying embedded-RP and unicast-based prefix
   specifications; this option is avoided.

   As a consequence, two multicast blocks are proposed to be used when
   embedding IPv4 address: one block for ASM (Section 7 ) and another
   one for the SSM (Section 8).

6.3.  Encapsulation vs. Translation

   IPv4-IPv6 encapsulator and translator may be embedded in the same
   device or even implemented with the same software module.  In order
   to help the function whether an encapsulated IPv6 multicast packets
   or translated IPv6 ones are to be transferred.  It was tempting to
   define an S-bit for that purpose but this choice has been abandoned
   in favor of the recommendation to use distinct MPREFIX64 for each
   scheme.

   As such, there is no need to reserve a bit in the IPv6 multicast
   address to separate between the translation and the encapsulation
   schemes.


7.  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Address Format: ASM Mode

   To meet the requirements listed in Section 6.2, the following address
   format is defined to enclose an IPv4 multicast address when ASM mode
   is used:

    |   8    |  4 |  4 |  4 |             76               |    32    |

    IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection bits (64IX):        |M|r|r|r|

   The description of the fields is as follows:

   o  "flgs" and "scop" fields are defined in [RFC4291].

   o  64IX field (IPv4-IPv6 interconnection bits): The first bit is the
      M-bit.  When "M-bit" is set to 1, it indicates that an multicast

      IPv4 address is embedded in the low-order 32 bits of the multicast
      IPv6 address.  All the remaining bits are reserved and MUST be set
      to 0.

   o  sub-group-id: This field is configurable according to local
      policies of the entity managing the IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection
      Function.  This field must follow the recommendations specified in
      [RFC3306] if If unicast-based prefix is used or the
      recommendations specified in [RFC3306] if embedded-RP is used.
      The default value is all zeros.

   o  The low-order 32 bits MUST include an IPv4 multicast address when
      the M-bit is set to 1.  The enclosed IPv4 multicast address SHOULD
      NOT be in 232/8 range.

         [[DISCUSSION NOTE: Restrict an IPv6 ASM address to embed only
         an ASM IPv4 address or relax it?]]


8.  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Address Format: SSM Mode

   As mentioned above, any IPv4-embedded IPv6 address used in SSM mode
   MUST be part of ff3x::/32 [RFC4607].  Figure 3 describes the format
   of the IPv6 multicast address to be used to enclose an IPv4 multicast
   address.

   The description of the fields is as follows:

   o  Flags must be set to 0011.

   o  "scop" is defined in [RFC4291].

   o  64IX field (IPv4-IPv6 interconnection bits): Same meaning as
      Section 7.

   o  sub-group-id: The default value is all zeros.

      the M-bit is set to 1.  The embedded IPv4 address SHOULD be in the
      232/8 range [RFC4607]. 232.0.0.1-232.0.0.255 range is being
      reserved to IANA.

         [[DISCUSSION NOTE: Restrict an IPv6 SSM address to embed only
         an SSM IPv4 address?]]


9.  Textual Representation

   The embedded IPv4 address in an IPv6 multicast address is included in
   the last 32 bits; therefore dotted decimal notation can be used.


10.  Multicast PREFIX64

   For the delivery of the IPv4-IPv6 multicast interconnection services,
   a dedicated multicast prefix denoted as MPREFIX64 should be
   provisioned to any function requiring to build an IPv4-embedded IPv6
   multicast address based on an IPv4 multicast address.  MPREFIX64 can
   be of ASM or SSM type.  When both modes are used, two prefixes are
   required to be provisioned.

   The structure of the MPREFIX64 follows the guidelines specified in
   Section 7 for the ASM mode and Section 8 when SSM mode is used.

   MPREFIX64 MAY be of any length from /32 to /96; /96 being the
   RECOMMENDED prefix length as shown in Figure 4).

   The format of the MPREFIX64 should be compatible with what is
   specified in [RFC3306] and [RFC3956] if corresponding mechanisms are
   used.

11.  Source IPv4 Address in the IPv6 Ream

   An IPv4 source is represented in the IPv6 realm with its IPv4-
   converted IPv6 address [RFC6052].


12.  IANA Considerations

   TBC.


13.  Security Considerations

   This document defined an address format to embed an IPv4 multicast
   address in an IPv6 multicast address.  The same security
   considerations as those discussed in [RFC6052] are to be taken into
   consideration.
