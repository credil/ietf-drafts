Internet-Draft             Labelcast Protocol                 March 2011


1.  Introduction

   Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) service has emerged as one of the
   most promising applications in the coming years.  IPTV video content
   is delivered over IP networks and based on IP techniques.  However,
   there is lacking efficient Internet protocols or mechanisms for IPTV
   services, especially between core network and access network, which
   is the bottleneck for IPTV data transmission.

   Peer-to-Peer based on application layer technology just concerns the
   logic network rather than real network states and topology, and a
   great deal of redundant streams pass over the core Internet.  Due to
   lack of administration, P2P reduces the ISPs_ benefits and is not
   feasible to IPTV live broadcast systems.  Pure clients P2P can_t be
   further developed to the main delivery technologies.

   IP multicast is insufficient to deploy largely-scale over the
   Internet because of their defects in scalability, user management,
   flow control, etc.  The scalability of IP multicast is an important
   issue and this hampers its implementation.  Routers keep every active
   group states and when the scale is increasing, the burden would be
   expanded.  Another problem in IP multicast is the reliability.  The
   UDP is used as the transport layer in IP multicast and the integrity
   of data will not be assured.

   The transport layer protocols TCP/UDP, which are not designed for
   IPTV service at the beginning, can not achieve the motivation of
   effective video traffic transmission due to the characteristics of
   IPTV streams, such as long-time connection, high bandwidth
   consumption and so on.

   TS over RTP/UDP are the most widely used transmission means for
   streaming media, however there are two problems.  One problem is that
   RTP/UDP can not provide efficient Point-to-Multipoint IPTV
   distribution methods.  Another is that RTP/UDP is in lack of support
   to monitoring the transfer quality of the video.  Not only end
   systems are hard to realize monitoring towards their QoE (Quality of
   Experience), but also the intermediate routing nodes can't optimize
   QoS due to the lack of enough information.

   Labelcast is a transport protocol supporting Point-to-Multipoint IPTV
   data distribution especially for the characteristics of long-lived
   connection, high bandwidth consumption and continuity.  This protocol
   contains abundant fields that can support Point-to-Multipoint data
   transmission, and video quality monitoring both for intermediate
   routing nodes and end systems.  Labelcast can efficiently meet the
   requirements of the video quality transmission monitoring, failure
   detection and isolation of network failures.

2.  Why we need Labelcast?

   IP multicast is considered as the most effective technology to solve
   the bandwidth problem in IPTV data transmission.  However, IP
   multicast is not a network-aware mechanism and can_t diagnose the
   transmission quality.  Most streams are concentrated in the minority
   paths (the shortest ones).  In IP multicast, the packets are just
   forwarded through the fixed paths, even if there is congestion
   between two nodes.  Besides, IP multicast is uncontrollable.

   Video monitor is the basis for market success of IPTV.  Transmission
   information is essential to quality monitor and how the IP packets
   are carried over networks.  It is therefore important for service
   providers and network providers to monitor the QoE of users when
   providing an IPTV service.

   Now there is lacking efficient data distribution mechanism for IPTV
   services, especially between core network and access network, which
   is the bottleneck for IPTV data transmission.  The transport
   technologies are not enough for the IPTV services and can_t satisfy
   the delays, jitters requirements.  It is very urgent and significant
   to design a new distribution mechanism especially for IPTV video
   network.

   Labelcast is a lightweight protocol and can provide abundant
   information for video quality monitor, failure detection, flow
   control, and so on.  Many fields are involved in Labelcast header.
   Labelcast is very suitable for IPTV data transmission.


3.  Labelcast Protocol

3.1.  Basic Ideas

   Labelcast setup the transmission paths between source and receivers
   through label switching.  Labelcast has the functions of identifying
   packets priorities, bandwidth reservation, calculating time
   difference, statistics packets loss rate, etc.  Based on this video
   streaming information, the network itself can evaluate the video
   transmission quality and optimize the scheduling strategies.  The
   basic ideas are as follows:

   1.  IPTV data distribution protocol based on Labelcast can support
       the characteristics of long-lived connection, high bandwidth
       consumption, real-time and continuity.

   2.  It is easier to realize Point-to-Multipoint data transmission
       than traditional multicast by the utility of labels.

Internet-Draft             Labelcast Protocol                 March 2011


   3.  It can reduce the processing overhead of intermediate routing
       nodes.

   4.  The fields associated with streaming media traffic can support
       monitoring of video transmission quality.

   Besides, the evaluation of the video transmission quality at
   intermediate routing nodes and end systems can take advantage of MDI
   index which is defined in RFC 4445.  DF and MLR values are included
   in MDI.  DF value reflects the delay jitter of the video traffic and
   MLR value reflects the loss rates of the video traffic.  The
   bandwidth of the transmission requirement, loss rate and the delay
   jitters can also be calculated by intermediate routing nodes, and the
   flow QoS can be controlled.

3.2.  Labelcast Header

   Labelcast header has the length of 8 bytes with seven fields which is
   illustrated in figure 1.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |Ver|Pri|         Seq           |    BW     |       Aid         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |        Label                  |            TS                 |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                           Figure 1: Head Format

   (1) Ver [0:1] is the version of Labelcast protocol and it is defined
   "01" initially.

   (2) Pri[0:1] denotes packets priority of discarding.  It is
   corresponding to the packet types of I frame, B frame and P frame
   which reflects the importance of packets. 11: having the highest
   discarding priority when there is a congestion (The first to be
   dropped). 00: having the lowest discarding level if there is a
   congestion (The last to be dropped).  When network congestion occurs,
   flow control based on priorities can be realized.

   (3) Seq [0:11] denotes the sequences of packets which is used for the
   detection of the packets loss.  It denotes the sequences of packets
   in the flow.  It is used to monitor the packets loss and order.
   Suppose the sequence field is k bits, the length of packets is n
   bytes, and the bandwidth of the flow is Mbps, then the period of the
   sequence is Tseq = 2^k * n/M.

Internet-Draft             Labelcast Protocol                 March 2011


   (4) BW[0:5] denotes that the average bandwidth of flow is BW*128Kbps.
   The maximum value is 8Mbps.  BW which has the value of 0 denotes that
   bandwidth is unknown.

   (5) Aid [0:7] denotes the application ID.

   (6) Label[0:15] denotes labels related to the packets routing.  The
   processing actions of nodes are determined by this field.  The nodes
   which support the label determine the next hop forwarding nodes by
   looking up the label table.

   (7) TS[0:15] denotes the sending timestamp of packets, of which the
   unit is us(microsecond).  It is used to account the delay between two
   nodes.

3.3.  The Requirement for IP Protocol Fields

   The value of Labelcast protocol which is identified in IP header
   field is 123.


4.  Requirement of Protocol

4.1.  Processing Requirement

4.1.1.  Building the Label Paths

   Similar to ATM and MPLS, the virtual paths are established between
   the source and each receiver with extra means before IPTV data
   transmission.  The extra means could be the signaling protocol of
   MPLS LDP, or centralized control manners of static calculation and
   configuration.

4.1.2.  Requirement of the Source

   (1) If source is unaware of the contents of applications, the Pri
   field is filled with 00 uniformly.

   (2) Seq field could be filled when the packets are sent from source.

   (3) BW field could be filled when the packets are sent from source.

   (4) The Aid field should be filled according to the application
   requirements.

   (5) Label field could be filled when the packets are sent from
   source.

Internet-Draft             Labelcast Protocol                 March 2011


   (6) The TS field could be filled when the packets are sent from
   source.

4.1.3.  Processing Requirement of Labelcast Forwarding Nodes

   (1) Ver, Pri, Seq, BW and Aid can't be modified by Labelcast
   forwarding nodes.

   (2) Label field should be modified according to the next hop
   distribution nodes.  When packets arrive at the Label nodes, Label
   table is looked up at first.  From the label table, the local
   processing actions and the next egress labels are known .

   (3) According to the extra configure, TS field could be modified or
   keep unchanged by the forwarding nodes.

   (4) The nodes which don't support Labelcast protocol can forward the
   packets based on IP address.

   In order to prevent the initial virtual paths being deviated by IP
   forwarding from their inherent orientations, IP tunnels should be
   adopted.  The packets are encapsulated with the address of next hop
   Labelcast nodes as the destination address, and then they can be sent
   to the next hop Label nodes directly.

4.1.4.  Requirement of End Systems

   (1) The end systems submit the payload of packets to different
   applications according to Aid field.

   (2) The video transmission quality can be evaluated with BW, Seq, TS
   parameters etc.

4.2.  Impact on protocol stack

4.2.1.  Source serve

   The communication interface will be negotiated between server and
   client before data transmission, Labelcast packets are identified by
   Aid. The session manager in Source Server addes the Labelcast module
   and it can support TCP, UDP and Labelcast.  Stream processor can
   provide RTSP/RTP/UDP/HTTP/Labelcast and it encapsulates the transport
   layer header with Labelcast protocol form.

4.2.2.  Client

   Client receives Labelcast packets with Raw Socket, it resolves
   Labelcast packets and sends the payload to the applications.  Clients

   sample the video content and send the related information such as BW,
   Seq, TS to monitor.

4.2.3.  Forwarding Node

   When a intermediate Labelcast node receives the Labelcast packets, it
   mainly has three processes: 1.  Modify the TTL options in the header
   and recompute the checksum of IP header. 2.  Modify the timestamp of
   the header, and rewirte the local time. 3. look up the label table,
   get the next hop, and replace the label.


5.  Application Example

5.1.  Point-to-Multipoint Data Distribution Based on Labels

   The label paths are composed of many labelcast nodes in series, and
   labels are assigned before the transmission of video traffic.  The
   label tables are established according to their forwarding paths.
   The next hop Label nodes (one or multiple) can be determined by
   looking up the labels of packets in label table.

                  +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                  |Ingress |Ingress | Egress | Egress |

                          \                       /

Internet-Draft             Labelcast Protocol                 March 2011


                        Figure 2: Label Processing

   Figure 2 shows the label processing.  When the packets with label 13
   arrive at port 1 of Labelcast node L1, L1 looks up the lable
   table,then determine the forwarding ports and their corresponding new
   labels.  Since there are two forwarding ports for packets arriving
   port 1 with label 13, the packets are replicated at L1, and forwarded
   to port 2 and port3.  Before the forwarding process, the labels of
   packets are modified with new labels of 26 and 19 respectively.

5.2.  Video-awre Network Processing

   Labelcast protocol can simplify the video traffic identifications at
   network nodes and can guarantee application-awree QoS through the Pri
   field which is initilized at the source.  The video transmission
   quality can be monitored through Bw, TS, Seq fields, and
   correspondingly the distribution paths are optimized by the
   monitoring results.  For example, the arrival intervals can be
   calculated by the Bw and length of packets, and then the delay
   jitters of the successive arriving packets can be concluded.  Based
   on this, the processing actions of forwarding nodes can be optimized.

5.3.  Detecting Network Status

   The characteristics of video transmission are high bandwidth-
   occupied, time-orderly, so they have high network requirement for
   Internet.  For its continuity and time-orderly, video traffic itself
   is a good manner of network measurement, and network information is
   placed in the header of Labelcast protocol.  Network status can be
   known by the Labelcast protocol.  Through the analysis of TS and Seq
   fields, the performance of network can be acquired.

   The timestamps are marked by each Label nodes passing by, and whether
   or not the upstream links are congested can be inferred through the
   delay jitters between packets. t1,t2 denote the timestamps of two
   packets with N intervals in previous hop Label node, and the
   timestamps of local Label node are t3 and t4, then formula a=(t4-t3)/
   (t2-t1) reflects the delay jitter of previous hop.


6.  More Discussion

6.1.  The Role of IP Multicast Address

   In Labelcast, the forwarding information is embedded into the label
   field, and the packets are forwarded by the label swapped.  Label
   aggregation techniques can be used to reduce the forwarding states.
   IP multicast address is identified as different group ID in

Internet-Draft             Labelcast Protocol                 March 2011


   Labelcast.  If the forwarding node is not a Labelcast node, the
   packets is forwarded as layer 3 processing.

6.2.  Labelcast Deployment

   Labelcast changes little to the underlay network, and can be deployed
   gradually.  Labelcast processing module can be added into router by
   ISP and this value-added module can bring more profits.  The normal
   node can exist in two Labelcast nodes.  Unlike in MPLS or IP
   multicast, all the routers must support them.  IP tunnel can be used
   when the nodes is not a Labelcast node, and it lookup the unicast or
   multicast table to confirm the forwarding port.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA issues brought by Labelcast is what we need take into
   consideration.


8.  Security Considerations

   The security issues brought by Labelcast is what we need take into
   consideration.
