                 draft-ietf-dccp-tfrc-rtt-option-05.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies an update to the round trip time (RTT)
   estimation algorithm used for TFRC (TCP Friendly Rate Control)
   congestion control by the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol
   (DCCP).  It updates specifications for the CCID-3 and CCID-4
   Congestion Control IDs of DCCP.

   The update addresses parameter-estimation problems occurring with
   TFRC-based DCCP congestion control.  It uses a recommendation made in
   the original TFRC specification to avoid the inherent problems of
   receiver-based RTT sampling, by utilising higher-accuracy RTT samples
   already available at the sender.

   It is integrated into the feature set of DCCP as an end-to-end
   negotiable extension.

Internet-Draft     Sender RTT Estimate Option for DCCP        March 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a Standards Track update to both a sender and
   receiver that implement DCCP CCID-3 [RFC4342] or CCID-4 [RFC5622],
   addressing RTT estimation problems that were observed when using a
   real implementation.

   To fix these problems, this document presents a solution based on a
   concept first recommended in [RFC5348], 3.2.1; i.e. to measure the
   RTT at the sender.  This results in a higher reliability and
   frequency of samples, and avoids the inherent problems of receiver-
   based RTT sampling discussed below.

   We begin by analysing the encountered problems in the next section.
   The update is presented in Section 3.  We then discuss security
   considerations in Section 4, and list the resulting IANA
   considerations in Section 5.

2.  Problems caused by sampling the RTT at the receiver

   There are at least six areas that make a TFRC receiver vulnerable to
   inaccuracies or absence of (receiver-based) RTT samples:

   o  the measured sending rate, X_recv ([RFC5348], 6.2);

   o  synthesis of the first loss interval ([RFC5348], 6.3.1);

   o  disambiguation of loss events ([RFC4342], 10.2);

   o  validation of loss intervals ([RFC4342], 6.1);

   o  ensuring that at least one feedback packet is sent per RTT
      ([RFC4342], 10.3);

   o  determining quiescence periods ([RFC4342], 6.4).

2.1.  List of problems encountered with a real implementation

   This section summarizes several years of experience using the Linux
   implementation of CCID-3 and CCID-4.  It lists the problems
   encountered with receiver-based RTT sampling over real networks, in a
   variety of wired and wireless environments and under different link-
   layer conditions.

   The Linux DCCP/TFRC implementation is based on the RTT-sampling
   algorithm specified in [RFC4342], 8.1.  This algorithm relies on a
   coarse-grained window-counter (units of RTT/4), and uses packet
   inter-arrival times to estimate the current RTT of the network.

   The algorithm is effective only for packets with modulo-16 CCVal
   differences less than 5, due to limitations noted in sections 8.1 and
   10.3 of [RFC4342].  A CCVal difference less than 4 means sampling at
   sub-RTT scale; [RFC4342], 8.1 thus suggests differences between 2 and
   4, the latter being preferable (equivalent to a full RTT).  The same
   section limits the maximum CCVal difference between data-carrying
   packets to 5, in order to avoid wrap-around.  As a consequence, it is
   not possible to determine the timing interval for adjacent packets
   with a CCVal difference greater than 4: such samples have to be
   discarded.

   A second problem arises when there are holes in the sequence space.
   Because the 4-bit CCVal counter may cycle around multiple times, it
   is not possible to determine window-counter wrap-around whenever
   sequence numbers of subsequent packets are not immediately adjacent.
   This problem occurs when packets are delayed, reordered, or lost in
   the network.

   As a consequence, RTT sampling has to be paused during times of loss.
   This however aggravates the problem, since the sender now requires
   new feedback from the receiver, but the receiver is unable to provide
   accurate and up-to-date information: the receiver is unable to sample
   the RTT, accordingly also not able to estimate X_recv correctly,
   which then in turn affects X_Bps at the sender.

   The third limitation arises from using inter-arrival times as
   representatives of network inter-packet gaps.  It is well known that
   the inter-packet gap of packets is not constant along a network path.
   Furthermore, modern network interface cards do not necessarily
   deliver each packet at the time it is received, but rather in a
   bunch, to avoid overly frequent interrupts [MR97].  As a result,
   inter-packet arrival times may converge to zero, when subsequent
   packets are being delivered at virtually the same time.

   The fourth problem is that of under-sampling and thus related to the
   first limitation.  If loss occurs while the receiver has not yet had
   a chance to sample the RTT, it needs to fall back to some fixed RTT
   constant to plug into the equation of [RFC5348], 6.3.1.  (The sender,
   for example, uses a fixed value of 1 second when it is unable to
   obtain an initial RTT sample, see [RFC5348], 4.2).

   In particular, if the loss is caused by a transient condition, this
   fourth problem causes a subsequent deterioration of the connection
   (rate reduction), further aggravated by the fact that TFRC takes
   longer than common window-based protocols to recover from a reduction
   of its allowed sending rate.

   Trying to smooth over these effects by imposing heavy filtering on
   the RTT samples did not substantially improve the situation, nor does
   it solve the problem of under-sampling.

   The TFRC sender, on the other hand, is much better equipped to
   estimate the RTT and can do this more accurately.  This is in
   particular due to the use of timestamps and elapsed time information
   ([RFC5348], 3.2.2), which are mandatory in CCID-3 (sections 6 and 8.2
   of [RFC4342]).

2.2.  Other areas affected by the RTT sampling problems

   We here analyse the impact that unreliability of receiver-based RTT
   sampling has on the areas listed at the begin of this section.

   In addition, benefits of sender-based RTT sampling have already been
   pointed out in [RFC5348], and in the specification of CCID-3
   [RFC4342], at the end of section 10.2.

2.2.1.  Measured Receive Rate X_recv

   A key problem is that the reliability of X_recv [RFC4342] depends
   directly upon the reliability and accuracy of RTT samples.  This
   means that failures propagate from one parameter to another.

   Errata IDs 610 and 611 update [RFC4342] to use the definition of the
   receive rate as specified in [RFC5348].

   Having an explicit (rather than a coarse-grained) RTT estimate allows
   measurement of X_recv with greater accuracy, and isolates failure.

   An explicit RTT estimate also enables the receiver to more accurately
   perform the test in step (2) of [RFC4342], 6.2, i.e. to check whether
   less or more than one RTT has passed since the last feedback.

2.2.2.  Disambiguation and Accuracy of Loss Intervals

   Since a loss event is defined as one or more lost (or ECN-marked)
   data packets in one RTT ([RFC5348], 5.2), the receiver needs accurate
   RTT estimates to validate and accurately separate loss events.
   Moreover, [RFC5348], 5.2 expressly points out the sender RTT estimate
   as RECOMMENDED for this purpose.

   Having the sender RTT Estimate available further increases the
   accuracy of the information reported by the receiver.  The definition
   of Loss Intervals in [RFC4342], 6.1 needs the RTT to separate the
   lossy parts; in particular, lossy parts spanning a period of more
   than one RTT are invalid.

   A similar benefit arises in the computation of the loss event rate:
   as discussed in section 9.2 of [RFC4342], it may happen that sender
   and receiver compute different loss event rates, due to differences
   in the available timing information.  An explicit RTT estimate
   increases the accuracy of information available at the receiver, thus
   the sender may not need to recompute the (less reliable) loss event
   rate reported by the receiver.

2.2.3.  Determining Quiescence

   The quiescence period is defined as max(2 * RTT, 0.2 sec) in section
   6.4 of [RFC4342].  An explicit RTT estimate avoids under- and over-
   estimating quiescence periods.

2.2.4.  Practical Considerations

   Using explicit RTT estimates contributes to greater robustness and
   can also result in simpler implementation.

   First, it becomes easier to separate adjacent loss events.  The 4-bit
   counter value wraps relatively frequently, which requires additional
   procedures to avoid aliasing effects.

   Second, the receiver is better able to determine when to send
   feedback packets.  It can perform the test described in step (2) of
   [RFC5348], 6.2 more accurately.  Moreover, unnecessary expiration of
   the nofeedback timer (as described in [RFC4342], 10.3) can be
   avoided.

   Lastly, a sender-based RTT estimate option can be used by middleboxes
   to verify that a flow uses conforming end-to-end congestion control
   ([RFC4342], 10.2).

3.  Specification

3.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses the conventions of [RFC5348], [RFC4340],
   [RFC4342], and [RFC5622].

   All multi-byte field descriptions presented in this documented are in
   network byte order (most significant byte first).

3.2.  Options and Features

   This document defines a single TFRC-specific option, RTT Estimate,
   described in the next subsection.

   Following the guidelines in [RFC4340], section 15, the use of the RTT
   Estimate Option is governed by an associated feature, Send RTT
   Estimate Feature.  This feature is described in the second
   subsection.

3.2.1.  RTT Estimate Option

   The sender communicates its current RTT estimate to the receiver
   using a RTT Estimate Option.

   The 1..3 value bytes of the option data carry the current RTT
   estimate of the sender, using a granularity of 1 microsecond.  This
   allows values up to 16.7 seconds (corresponding to 0xFFFFFE) to be
   communicated.

   The value 0xFFFFFF is reserved to indicate significant delay spikes,
   larger than 16.7 seconds.  This is qualitative rather than
   quantitative information, to alert the receiver that there is a
   network problem (for instance jamming on a wireless channel).

   The use of the RTT Estimate Option on networks with RTTs larger than
   16.7 seconds is not specified by this document (as per Section 3.3,
   the sender would then always report 0xFFFFFF).

   A value of 0 indicates the absence of a valid RTT sample.  The sender
   MUST set the value to 0 if it does not yet have an RTT estimate.

   The sender SHOULD select the smallest format suitable to carry the
   RTT estimate (i.e., less than 1 byte of leading zeroes).

3.2.2.  Send RTT Estimate Feature

   The Send RTT Estimate feature lets endpoints negotiate whether the
   sender MUST provide RTT Estimate options on its data packets.

      Table 2: The Send RTT Estimate feature defined by this document

   The column meanings are described in [RFC4340], section 6.4.

   The Send RTT Estimate feature is OPTIONAL.  An extension may
   implement it, but this specification does not require the feature to
   be understood by every DCCP implementation (see [RFC4340], section
   15).  The feature is off by default (initial value of 0).

   DCCP B sends a "Mandatory Change R(Send RTT Estimate, 1)" to require
   DCCP A to send RTT Estimate options as part of its data traffic (DCCP
   A will reset the connection if it does not understand this feature).

3.3.  Basic Usage

   When the Send RTT Estimate Feature is enabled, the sender MUST
   provide an RTT Estimate Option on all of its Data, DataAck, Sync, and
   SyncAck packets.  It MAY in addition provide the RTT Estimate Option
   on other packet types, such as DCCP-Ack.  If the RTT is larger than
   the maximum representable value (0xFFFFFE), the sender MUST set the
   value of the RTT Estimate Option to 0xFFFFFF.

   The sender MUST implement and continue to update the CCVal window
   counter as specified in [RFC4342], section 8.1, even when the Send
   RTT Estimate Feature is on.

   When the Send RTT Estimate Feature is enabled, the receiver MUST use
   the value reported by the RTT Estimate Option in all places that
   require a RTT (listed at the begin of Section 2).  If the receiver
   encounters an invalid RTT Estimate Option (Section 3.2.1), it MUST
   reset the connection with Reset Code 5, "Option Error", where the
   Data 1..3 fields are set to the first 3 bytes of the offending RTT
   Estimate Option.

Internet-Draft     Sender RTT Estimate Option for DCCP        March 2011


   The receiver SHOULD track the long-term RTT estimate using a moving
   average, such as the one specified in [RFC5348], 4.3.  This long-term
   estimate is referred to as "receiver_RTT" below.

   When the Send RTT Estimate Feature is disabled, the receiver MUST
   estimate the RTT as previously specified in [RFC4340], [RFC4342], and
   [RFC5622].

3.4.  Receiver Robustness Measures

   This subsection specifies robustness measures for the receiver when
   the Send RTT Estimate Feature is on.

   The 0-valued and 0xFFFFFF-valued RTT Estimate Options are both
   referred to as "no-number RTT options".  RTT Estimate Options with
   values in the range of 1..0xFFFFFE are analogously called "numeric
   RTT options".

   Until the first numeric RTT option arrives, the receiver MUST use a
   value of 0.5 seconds for receiver_RTT (to match the initial 2 second
   timeout of the TFRC nofeedback timer, [RFC5348], 4.2).

   If the path RTT is known, e.g. from a previous connection [RFC2140],
   the receiver MAY reuse the previously known path RTT value to seed
   its long-term RTT estimate.

   The sender MAY occasionally send no-number RTT options, covering for
   transient changes and spurious disruptions.  During these times, the
   receiver SHOULD continue to use its long-term receiver_RTT value.

   To avoid under-estimating the RTT in the absence of numeric options,
   the receiver MUST back off receiver_RTT in the following manner: if
   the sender supplies no-number RTT options for longer than
   receiver_RTT units of time, the receiver sets

             receiver_RTT = MIN(2 * receiver_RTT, t_mbi)

   where t_mbi = 64 seconds is the maximum backoff interval ([RFC5348],
   Appendix A).  For the next round of no-number RTT options, the
   updated value of receiver_RTT applies.

   This back-off mechanism ensures that short-term disruptions do not
   have a lasting impact, whereas long-term problems will result in
   asymptotically high receiver_RTT values.

   To bail out from a hanging session, the receiver MAY close the
   connection when receiver_RTT has reached the value MAX_RTT.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for CCID-3 have been discussed in section 11
   of [RFC4342]; for CCID-4 these have been discussed in section 13 of
   [RFC5622], referring back to the same section of [RFC4342].

   This document introduces an extension to communicate the current RTT
   estimate of the sender to the receiver of a TFRC communication.

   By altering the value of the RTT Estimate Option, it is possible to
   interfere with the behaviour of a flow using TFRC.  In particular,
   since accuracy of the RTT estimate directly influences the accuracy
   of the measured sending rate X_recv, it would be possible to obtain
   either higher or lower sending rates than are warranted by the
   current network conditions.

   This is only possible if an attacker is on the same path as the DCCP
   sender and receiver, and is able to guess valid sequence numbers.
   Therefore the considerations of section 18 in [RFC4340] apply.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests identical allocation in the dccp-ccid3-
   parameters and the dccp-ccid4-parameters registries.

5.1.  Option Types

   This document defines a single CCID-specific option for communicating
   RTT estimates from the HC-sender to the HC-receiver.  Following
   [RFC4340], 10.3, this requires an option number for the RTT Estimate
   Option in the range 128...191.

   When the IANA has allocated an option number for the `RTT Estimate'
   option, please replace all occurrences of the placeholder `XX' in
   this text with that number and delete this note.  (Due to [RFC4340],
   19.3 and [RFC4342], 12.2, the option number would be allocated in the
   range 128...183/191.)

5.2.  Feature Numbers

   This document defines a single CCID-specific feature number for the
   Send RTT Estimate feature which is located at the HC-sender.
   Following [RFC4340], 10.3, a feature number in the range 128...191 is
   required.

         - updated date to October

         - made spelling of RTT Estimate Option (singular) consistent

         - moved reference to RFC 5622 from normative to informative,
         since document status is Experimental

   o  Section 2.1:

         - clarified problematic cases of too small CCVal differences
         and CCVal differences > 4, feedback by Pasi

         - corrected naming of Send RTT Estimate Feature, feedback by
         Eddie

         - removed superfluous remark regarding scaling to microsecond
         granularity in 3.2.1, feedback by Pasi

         - removed recommendation of preferring long-term RTT samples,
         since this can not be generalized (connection may be short or
         path RTT may change, in both cases a long-term sample would not
         be useful), feedback by Pasi

         - made option variable-length (3/4/5 bytes), feedback by Eddie

         - specified condition for syntactic option validity

         - limited the maximum option size to 3 bytes and justified
         decision why not to support RTTs greater than 16 seconds, in
         reply to feedback by Eddie

         disproportionately high delay spikes (> 16.7 seconds)

   o  Section 3.3:

         - corrected naming of Send RTT Estimate Feature, feedback by

         referencing section 10.2 of RFC4342)

         - clarified how middleboxes might use a sender-based RTT
         estimate option to verify end-to-end congestion control

         (suggestion and quote taken from RFC4342, section 10.2)

   o  Section 3.3:

         - clarified how the receiver must behave if the Send RTT
         Estimate Feature is disabled, following feedback from Eddie
