Abstract

   This document recommends that several TCP extensions that have never
   seen widespread use be moved to Historic status.  The affected RFCs
   are RFC1072, RFC1106, RFC1110, RFC1145, RFC1146, RFC1263, RFC1379,
   RFC1644 and RFC1693.

1.  Introduction

   TCP has a long history, and several proposed TCP extensions have
   never seen widespread deployment.  Section 5 of the TCP "roadmap"
   document [RFC4614] already classifies a number of TCP extensions as
   Historic and describes the reasons for doing so, but it does not
   instruct the RFC Editor and IANA to change the status of these RFCs
   in the RFC database and the relevant IANA registries.  The sole
   purpose of this document is to do just that.  Please refer to Section
   5 of [RFC4614] for justification.


2.  RFC Editor Considerations

   The RFC Editor is requested to change the status of the following
   RFCs to Historic [RFC2026]:

   o  [RFC1106] and [RFC1110] related to the "TCP Big Window and NAK
      Options"

   o  [RFC1145] and [RFC1146] related to the "TCP Alternate Checksum
      Options"

   o  [RFC1263] on "TCP Extensions Considered Harmful"

   o  [RFC1379] and [RFC1644] on "TCP Extensions for Transactions"

   o  [RFC1693] on "TCP Partial Order Service"


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to mark the TCP options 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
   and 15 documented in [RFC1072], [RFC1146], [RFC1644] and [RFC1693] as
   "obsolete" in the TCP option numbers registry [TCPOPTREG], with a
   reference to this RFC.

   (None of the other documents moved to Historic status had TCP options
   numbers assigned; no IANA action is therefore required for them.)

   publication.]
