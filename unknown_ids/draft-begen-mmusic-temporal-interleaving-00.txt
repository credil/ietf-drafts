  Temporal Interleaving Attribute in the Session Description Protocol
              draft-begen-mmusic-temporal-interleaving-00

Abstract

   A straightforward approach to provide protection against network
   outages (or packet losses) with a longest duration of T time units is
   to simply duplicate the original packets and send each copy separated
   in time by at least T time units.  This approach is commonly referred
   to as Temporal Redundancy or Temporal Interleaving.  This document
   defines an attribute to indicate the presence of temporally redundant
   media streams and the interleaving period in the Session Description
   Protocol.

Internet-Draft   Temporal Interleaving Attribute in SDP       March 2011


1.  Introduction

   Consider that a media sender transmits an original source packet and
   transmits its duplicate after an interleaving period following the
   original transmission.  If a network outage hits the original
   transmission, the expectation is that the second transmission arrives
   at the receiver.  Alternatively, the second transmission may be hit
   by an outage or gets dropped, and the original transmission completes
   successfully.  On the receiver side, both transmissions can also
   arrive and in that case, the receiver (or the node that does the
   duplicate suppression) needs to identify the duplicate packet(s) and
   discard them appropriately, producing a duplication-free stream.

   Temporal interleaving can be used in a variety of multimedia
   applications where there is sufficient bandwidth for the duplicated
   traffic and the application can tolerate the delay caused by
   interleaving.  One particular use case is to improve the reliability
   of real-time video feeds inside a core IP network [IC2011].  Compared
   to other popular redundancy approaches such as Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] and redundant data
   encoding (e.g., [RFC2198]), temporal interleaving is quite easy to
   implement since it does not require any special type of encoding or
   decoding.

   For duplicate suppression, the receiver has to be able to identify
   the identical packets.  This is straightforward for media packets
   that carry one or more unique identifiers such as the sequence number
   field in RTP header [RFC3550].  The receiver can also use alternative
   approaches to compare the incoming packets and discard the duplicate
   ones.

   In this specification, we are not concerned about how the sender
   should determine the interleaving period or how the receiver can
   suppress the duplicate packets.  Rather, we introduce a new attribute
   for the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] that indicates
   that the media stream is to be sent two or more times using the
   interleaving approach and also indicates the interleaving period for
   each additional duplication.

   In practice, more than two redundant streams for temporal
   interleaving are unlikely to be used since the additional delay and
   increased overhead are not easily justified.  However, we define the
   new attribute in a general way so that it could be used with more
   than two redundant streams if needed.  The new attribute is
   applicable to both RTP and non-RTP streams.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  The "temporal-interleaving" Attribute

   The following ABNF [RFC5234] syntax formally describes the
   'interleaving-period' attribute:


       interleaving-attribute = "a=interleaving-period:" periods CRLF
       periods                = period *( ":" period)
       period                 = 1*DIGIT ; in milliseconds

       Figure 1: ABNF syntax for the 'interleaving-period' attribute

   The 'interleaving-period' attribute is defined as both a media-level
   and session-level attribute.  It specifies the interleaving duration
   in milliseconds (ms).


4.  SDP Examples

   In the example below, the multicast stream is duplicated with an
   interleaving period of 100 ms.


        v=0
        o=ali 1122334455 1122334466 IN IP4 red.example.com
        s=Temporal Interleaving
        t=0 0
        m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 100
        c=IN IP4 233.252.0.1/127
        a=source-filter:incl IN IP4 233.252.0.1 198.51.100.1
        a=rtpmap:100 MP2T/90000
        a=temporal-interleaving:100
        a=mid:S1

   In the second example below, the multicast stream is duplicated
   twice. 50 ms after the original transmission, the first duplicate is
   transmitted and 100 ms after that, the second duplicate is
   transmitted.  In other words, the same packet is transmitted three
   times over a period of 150 ms.

        a=rtpmap:100 MP2T/90000
        a=temporal-interleaving:50:100
        a=mid:S2


5.  Performance Evaluation and Reporting

   Editor's note:  This section should discuss how the receiver should
   prepare the RTCP receiver reports or whether a new XR report is
   needed.


6.  Security Considerations

   The 'interleaving-period' attribute is not believed to introduce any
   significant security risk to multimedia applications.  A malevolent
   third party could use this attribute to misguide the receiver(s)
   about the interleaving periods and/or the number of redundant
   streams.  For example, if the malevolent third party increases the
   value of the interleaving period, the receiver(s) will unnecessarily
   incur a longer delay since they will have to wait for the entire
   interleaving period.  Or, if the interleaving period is reduced by
   the malevolent third party, the receiver(s) might not wait long
   enough for the duplicated transmission and incur unnecessary packet
   losses.  However, these require intercepting and rewriting the
   packets carrying the SDP description; and if an interceptor can do
   that, many more attacks are also possible.

   In order to avoid attacks of this sort, the SDP description needs to
   be integrity protected and provided with source authentication.  This
   can, for example, be achieved on an end-to-end basis using S/MIME
   [RFC5652] [RFC5751] when SDP is used in a signaling packet using MIME
   types (application/sdp).  Alternatively, HTTPS [RFC2818] or the
   authentication method in the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
   [RFC2974] could be used as well.
