Abstract

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) guides an application,
   especially a Peer to Peer (P2P) application, to select hosts from
   its candidate set. ALTO is a promising technique for future network,
   as it is able to jointly optimize network resource utilization and
   application performance. The ALTO protocol is Client-Server based.
   Applications work as ALTO clients to fetch PID information from the
   ALTO server, but the ALTO server can't send the notification to ALTO
   clients, even if there is a major change to the networks. This draft
   discusses the requirements for server initialized notification, and
   proposes one mechanism to enable the ALTO server notification.

1. Introduction

   Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) provides a solution
   benefits both Internet Service Provider (ISP) and P2P
   operators/applications. In this solution, P2P applications utilize
   network information provided by ALTO service to optimize its traffic.
   However, the current ALTO mechanism depends on ALTO clients fetching
   network information from the servers, and neglects the requirements
   to proactively dispatching such information. Unfortunately, there
   are some scenarios that rapid dispatching of network information is
   valuable.

   In this draft, one mechanism is proposed to dispatch the newest
   network information from ALTO server to ALTO clients quickly. It
   will let P2P applications know the new network information. The
   performance of peer selection and ISP traffic management will be
   improved.

   Because traffic generated by tracker indexed P2P applications
   predominates current P2P networks. This draft considers only the
   server notification implementation based on tracker indexed P2P
   applications.



2. Problem statement

   ALTO enhances the traffic optimization capability of ISPs. However,
   networks and the optimization policy of ISPs are changing frequently.
   Current ALTO protocol uses B/S architecture. ALTO server is the
   passive side, and there is only one direction of ALTO message
   process. ALTO clients send query message periodically to ALTO server
   for the network and optimization information. This kind of passive
   mode cannot response quickly to network or ISP's network provision
   policy change.  When a network change occurs, although the ISP
   updates the ALTO server simultaneously, P2P traffic keeps following
   the guidance of the previous ALTO direction, as ALTO clients have no
   knowledge of the change. This will cause a period of pressure to ISP
   network and raises maintenance problems.



3. Requirement

   Whenever the change of network condition leads to the change of
   network map and cost map in ALTO server, the ALTO server SHOULD
   notify the change to ALTO clients as quickly as possible, and need
   not wait for the ALTO query message of next period as illustrated in
   current ALTO protocol.



4. Server initiating notification mechanism


   In this mechanism, ALTO server will maintain one table to record the
   address information about each ALTO client. ALTO server will
   initiate the notification message connection using the address
   information. The address information will be used to identify the
   ALTO client, which can be the IP address/port or the URL of tracker
   which has the ALTO client. In order to improve the ALTO server's
   efficiency, only P2P tracker and application server will be notified
   by ALTO server.

   One new ALTO message is added in this mechanism, notification
   message. The source of the message is the ALTO server, and the
   destination is the ALTO client which recorded in the table.

   HTTP protocol is used to build notification message. One lightweight
   HTTP server module is needed in ALTO client to receive notification
   message, as well as HTTP client is needed in the ALTO server.





4.1. The processing

   When network condition changes, the ALTO server will refresh its
   network map and cost map according to the related policy. Once the
   update is finished, ALTO server will build the notification message
   and send to the ALTO clients. When ALTO client receives the
   notification message, it will send the ALTO query message
   immediately to get the renewed network/cost map. This ALTO query
   message is the same with the current ALTO protocol. When ALTO client
   receives the notification message, it need not send any response
   message.
