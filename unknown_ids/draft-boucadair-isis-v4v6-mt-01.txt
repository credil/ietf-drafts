Abstract

   This memo defines two new Multi Topology Routing Identifiers (MT IDs)
   to be used by the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (M-ISIS,
   [RFC5120]) routing protocol within a Multi-Topology (MT) context.
   These new M-ISIS topologies are meant to convey routing information
   which is specific to IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].  The goal of running separate
   instances for IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes is to isolate the IPv6 routing
   table from the IPv4 routing table, and to avoid any overload due to
   the population of the table by IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes.  This
   isolation is motivated also from an operational perspective to
   enforce specific routing policies for each topology.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft           IPv4-mapped IPv6 M-ISIS            October 2009


1.  Introduction

   M-ISIS [RFC5120] is a mechanism that has been specified to run within
   a single IS-IS [RFC1195] domain where various logical IS-IS
   topologies are deployed, based on several criteria such as the need
   to differentiate IPv6 topologies from IPv4 topologies.  Distinct MT
   IDs (Multi Topology Identifiers) are assigned by IANA (e.g., MT ID #
   0 for standard topology, MT ID # 2 for IPv6 routing topology, etc.).
   MT ID # 6-#3995 range is reserved for IETF consensus.  This document
   requests the assignment of two new MT IDs for the following usages:

   o  Unicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 IS-IS routing topology;

   o  Multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 IS-IS routing topology.

   Within the context of IPv4 address exhaustion and the IPv6-IPv4
   interconnection, numerous solutions are being elaborated within IETF.
   Both translation (e.g., [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] and
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate]) and encapsulation (e.g.,
   [I-D.boucadair-dslite-interco-v4v6] and
   [I-D.boucadair-behave-ipv6-portrange]) schemes are proposed to
   facilitate IPv6-IPv4 interconnection.  These solutions require the
   injection of routes to IPv4-mapped IPv6
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] destinations in intra-domain routing
   protocols.

   In order to prevent any overload of the native IPv6 routing table
   with IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes, this memo defines new M-ISIS IDs which
   are required for the activation of multiple M-ISIS topologies,
   including one topology that is dedicated to IPv4-mapped routing (both
   unicast and multicast).  This is motivated also for operational
   reasons and to ease the migration to full IPv6.  As a result, an
   unicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 topology may be established and used for
   unicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 route computation purposes, and a multicast
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 topology may be established and used for multicast
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 route computation purposes.


2.  Multi-Topology Reachable IPv4 Mapped IPv6 Prefixes TLV

   No new TLV is required to indicate that the LSP packet conveys IPv4-
   mapped IPv6 (unicast and multicast, respectively) routes.  TLV type
   237 [RFC5120] must be used to announce IPv4 mapped IPv6 prefixes.


3.  Procedure

   This document does not require any modification to the procedure

   specified in [RFC5120].  Nevertheless, only routes to IPv4-mapped
   IPv6 prefixes MUST be instantiated within an IPv4-mapped IPv6 routing
   MT.  Concretely, the IANA prefix defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] MUST be supported by default.
   Service providers MAY also choose a LIR prefix to build the IPv4-
   mapped IPv6 addresses.


4.  Forwarding

   Only incoming datagrams destined to IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses are
   forwarded according to the IPv4-inferred IPv6 routing topology.  WKP
   and/or LIR prefix defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] MUST be
   configured in all participating nodes.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the following IS-IS MT IDs:

   o  MT ID# for unicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 topology

   o  MT ID# for multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 topology.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security issue in addition to
   those defined in [RFC5120].
