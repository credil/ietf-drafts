                   Grouping of Adjacent Media in SDP
               draft-jennings-mmusic-adjacent-grouping-00

Abstract

   Applications, such as multiple screen teleconference systems, often
   have multiple video streams that are organized to be displayed side
   by side.  This specification defines uses the RFC 5888 grouping
   semantics to define a new group type that indicates that multiple
   audio or video streams may be rendered side by side and also
   indicates the relative ordering of streams.

Internet-Draft            SDP Adjacent Grouping           September 2010


1.  Introduction

   There are many situations where applications create media streams
   that are meant do be displayed adjacent to each other.  A common
   example is a multi screen teleconference system.  Another examples
   are several video monitors placed side by side to display signs, and
   audio streams from a linear array of microphones.  SDP [RFC4566]
   allows negotiation of multiple media streams but does not have a way
   to carry the ordering information to indicate which media stream are
   adjacent to each other.

   This specification defines a new group, using the SDP grouping
   framework defined in [RFC5888] that indicates media streams are
   adjacent, and the adjacency order is defined by the order of the
   entires in the group.


2.  Terminology

   This specification uses all the terms defined in [RFC5888] and will
   not make sense unless you have read RFC 5888.  The key words "MUST",
   "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" in this specification
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Semantics

   This specification defines a new SDP group attribute of "ADJ" that
   indicates the media stream in this group are meant to be displayed
   adjacently.  Furthermore, the order of media streams in the group
   indicates the display order.  The first stream in the group MUST be
   the left most media stream then working to the right or clockwise
   from point of view of person viewing the media.

3.1.  Use in Offer/Answer systems

   The offer MUST contains the senders desired layout.  If the system
   sending the Answer supports this specification, then the Answer
   SHOULD indicate the actual layout selected.


4.  Examples

   A telepresence system with three screen and six audio channels, sends
   an SIP Offer to a two video conferencing system that with two screens
   that support stereo audio.  The following figure shows a top down
   view of the room with the telepresence system that is sending the
   Offer.  Screen A is the left most screen for the user in this room

   but should be displayed as the rightmost screen for user at the far
   end.  The M1 to M6 indicate the placement of the audio microphones
   for the six streams of audio.

     Screen A      Screen B     Screen C
   [----------][------------][------------]
    M1      M2  M3        M4  M5        M6


                    User


   Assume the SDP mid values for the screens are sa, sb, and sc, for
   screens a to c respectively and the audio streams have mid values m1
   to m6.  The offer would contain the following in the SDP:

       a=group:ADJ sc sb sa
       a=group:ADJ m6 m5 m4 m3 m2 m1

   There might be other media streams, such as presentation video, that
   are not part of any adjacency group.  If the far end decided to only
   accept the video from screen A and scene B and takes the audio from
   M1 and m6.  The answer would contain the following in the SDP:

       a=group:ADJ sb sa
       a=group:ADJ m6 m1

   As a note to implementors, consider the case where each screen had
   two media flows that were in the same FID group.  In this case all
   the media streams are still listed in the ADJ group and the order of
   two streams in the same FID group can be arbitrarily picked as they
   will be displayed on the same device.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification, following the Standards Action policy from
   [RFC5226], adds the following entry to the "Semantics for the group
   SDP Attribute" registry defined by [RFC5888].  [Note to RFC Editor:
   Please replace RFC-AAAA with the RFC number for this specification.]

6.  Security Considerations

   Like all SDP, integrity of this information is important.  When
   caring SDP in SIP, mechanisms such as TLS can provide hop by
   confidentiality and integrity.  End to end integrity can be provided
   by [RFC4474].

   Further discussion of security proprieties can be found in [RFC4566].
