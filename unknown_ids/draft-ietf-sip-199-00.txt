Abstract

   This specification defines a new SIP response code, 199 Early Dialog
   Terminated, which a SIP entity can use to indicate upstream that an
   early dialog has been terminated.  The response code can be used by a
   SIP entity, normally a forking SIP proxy, to allow the UAC to know
   that an early dialog has been terminated before it a final response
   is sent to the request.

1.  Introduction

   As defined in SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) specification
   [RFC3261], an early SIP dialog is created when a non-100 provisional
   response is sent to the dialog initiation request (e.g.  INVITE).
   The dialog is considered to be in early state until a final response
   is sent.

   When a proxy receives an initial request (outside an existing dialog,
   and without a pre-defined route set), it MAY forward it towards
   multiple remote destinations.  When the proxy does that, it performs
   forking.

   When a forking proxy receives non-100 provisional responses, it
   forwards the responses upstream towards the sender of the associated
   request.  When a forking proxy receives a 2xx final response, it
   forwards the response upstream towards the sender of the associated
   request.  At that point the proxy normally sends a CANCEL request
   downstream towards all remote destinations where it previously sent
   the request associated with the 2xx final response, and from which it
   has yet not received a final response, in order to terminate
   associated outstanding early dialogs.  When SIP entities upstream
   receive the 2xx final response they will automatically terminate
   other associated outstanding early dialogs.

   When a forking proxy receives a non-2xx final response, it does not
   always immediately forward the response upstream towards the sender
   of the associated request.  Instead, the forking proxy "stores" it
   and waits for further final responses from remote destinations where
   the forked request was forwarded.  At some point the proxy uses a
   specified mechanism to determine the "best" final response code, and
   forwards that final response upstream towards the sender of the
   associated request.  When SIP entities upstream receive the non-2xx
   final response they will automatically terminate the session setup
   and all associated early dialogs.

   Since the forking proxy does not always immediately forward non-2xx
   final responses, SIP entities upstream (including the UA that
   initiated the request) do not know that a specific early dialog has
   been terminated, and the SIP entities keep possible resources
   associated with the early dialog until they receive a final response
   from the forking proxy.

   This specification defines a new SIP response code, 199 Early Dialog
   Terminated, which a forking proxy can use to indicate upstream that
   an early dialog has been terminated.  The 199 response can also be
   sent by an UAS, prior to sending a non-2xx final response.  SIP
   entities that receive the 199 provisional response MAY release

   resources associated with the specific early dialog.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements

   REQ 1: It must be possible to indicate to the UAC that an early
   dialog has been terminated before a final response is sent.


4.  Client behavior

   When a client receives a 199 Early Dialog Terminated provisional
   response it MAY release resources and procedures associated with the
   early dialog the 199 response is received on.  Examples of resources
   and procedures are e.g. procedures for the establishment of media
   plane resources (bandwidth, radio, codecs etc), media security
   procedures or procedures related to NAT traversal.

   One example is when resources for a specific codec has been reserved
   only for the stream that is terminated.  In that case the resources
   associated with that codec can be released.

   Another example is when pre-conditions are used.  When the dialog is
   terminated, procedures and resources associated to the pre-conditions
   for that dialog can be released.

   Another example is when in-band security negotiation is used.  When
   the dialog is terminated, procedures and resrouces associated with
   the in-band security negototiation for that dialog can be released.

   If the client is able to associate the 199 response with a specific
   media stream, it MAY choose to discard media on that specific media
   stream, it MAY release all resources associated with that media
   stream and it MAY start to process media streams received on other
   early diaogs.  When the P-Early-Media header is used, a UA may
   trigger different actions depending on whether the header has been
   used for the terminated dialog.  How the association between the
   dialog and the associated media stream is done is outside the scope
   of this document.

   The UAC MAY use additional information (for example the final
   response which triggered the 199 response) received in the 199
   response when initiating new sessions, if it is possible to avoid the
   new session initation request to be rejected.


5.  Server behavior

   When a UAS wants to terminate a dialog it sends a non-2xx SIP final
   response, as specified in [RFC3261].  In addition, prior to sending
   the non-2xx SIP final response, the UAS MAY send a 199 response to
   indicate that the dialog is being terminated.


6.  Proxy behavior

   When a proxy receives a 199 provisional response, the proxy MUST
   process the response as any other non-100 provisional responses.  The
   proxy MUST forward the response upstream towards the sender of the
   associated request.  The proxy MAY release resources it has reserved
   associated with the early dialog on which the response is received.

   When a forking proxy receives a non-2xx final response which
   terminates one or more early dialogs and the proxy does not intend to
   forward the final response immediately (due to the rules for a
   forking proxy) it MUST send a 199 provisional response, for each
   associated early dialog that it can associate with the final
   response, upstream towards the sender of the associated request.  The
   199 provisional response MUST contain a To header tag parameter,
   which identifies the early dialog that has been terminated.

   NOTE: Since the forking proxy is not required to maintain state of
   all forked legs, it may not be able to send a 199 provisional
   response for each early dialog associated with the received non-2xx
   final response.


7.  Backward compability

   Since all SIP entities involved in a session setup do not necessarily
   support the specific meaning of the 199 Early Dialog Terminated
   provisional response, the sender of the response MUST be prepared to
   receive SIP requests associated with the dialog for which the 199
   response was sent.  If such request is received, and the receiver
   maintains state of the dialogs, the receiver MUST reply to such
   requests with a 481 final response.  A UAC that receives a 199
   response for an early dialog MUST NOT send any further requests on
   that dialog, except for a PRACK if the 199 response was sent

   reliably, and PRACKs for other reliable provisional responses that
   are to be acknowledged.

   The 199 Early Dialog Terminated response code MUST NOT "replace" a
   final response.  A final response MUST always be sent, after one or
   many 199 Early Dialog Terminated provisional responses have been
   sent.


8.  199 Early Dialog Terminated

   The 199 Early Dialog Terminated response code allows a SIP entity to
   indicate upstream that a specific dialog has been terminated, before
   a final response is sent by the entity.

   OPEN ISSUE: We need to discuss whether the To tag in the 199
   identifies the dialog that has been terminated, and/or if some
   additional information element (e.g.  SIP header) can be used, which
   would allow to indicate the termination of multiple dialogs in a
   single 199 response.

   OPEN ISSUE: We need to discuss whether, in addition to the dialog
   identifier, some additional information (e.g. the non-2xx final
   response which triggered the 199 response) should be provided in the
   199 response.


9.  Usage with SDP offer/answer

   A 199 Early Dialog Terminated provisional response MUST NOT contain a
   new SDP offer/answer message body, but the sender of the response MAY
   insert a copy of a previously sent offer/answer message body as
   otherwise allowed by the offer/answer rules for a provisional
   response.

   A forking proxy or a UAS MUST NOT trigger and send a 199 Early Dialog
   Terminated provisional response reliably in a situation where a
   reliable provisional response is required to contain an SDP offer/
   answer message body, according to [RFC3262] and [RFC3264].


10.  Usage with 100rel

   When a 199 Early Dialog Terminated provisional response is sent,
   since it is only used for information purpose, the sender is not
   required to send it reliably [RFC3262] even if the 100rel option tag
   is present in the Require header of the associated request.

   OPEN ISSUE: We need to discuss whether a proxy should send 199
   reliably at all, since the proxy would have to terminate the
   associated PRACK, and support the logic associated with 100rel.  If
   not sent, how would required 100rel affect the usage of 199?


11.  Example

   The figure shows an example, where a proxy (P1) forks an INVITE
   received from UAC.  The forked INVITE reaches UAS_2, UAS_3 and UAS_4,
   which send 18x provisional responses in order to create early dialogs
   between themselves and the UAC.  UAS_2 and UAS_3 rejects the INVITE
   by sending a 4xx error response.  When P1 receives the 4xx responses
   it immediately sends 199 Early Dialog Terminated responses,
   associated with the dialogs where the 4xx responses were received,
   towards the UAC.
