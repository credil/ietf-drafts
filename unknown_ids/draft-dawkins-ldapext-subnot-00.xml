<abstract>
	<t>This document extends Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to support 
		subscription and notification mechanism. An LDAP client can subscribe to 
		data of interest available from an LDAP server and receive notifications 
		from the LDAP server when this data is updated. By this means, an LDAP 
		client can become aware of changes to data of interest in a timely manner.
	</t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

	<t>This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) 
		(<xref target='RFC4510' />, <xref target='RFC4511' />, <xref target='RFC4512' />)
		to allow 
		LDAP clients to subscribe to data of interest available from 
		LDAP servers and be notified of changes to subscribed data. 
	</t>

	<t>This extension consists of one extended operation and one unsolicited notification 
		message. The Subscribe operation is used by the LDAP client to subscribe for 
		interested data in LDAP server. When the subscribed data are updated, the LDAP 
		server sends the notification message to the related LDAP client with required 
		data.
	</t>

</section>

<section title="Terminology in this Specification">

	<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
		"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
		this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 
		<xref target='RFC2119' />
	</t>

	<t>Augmented BNF (<xref target='RFC5234' />) is used in this specification.
	</t>

</section>

<section title="Applicability of this Specification">

	<t>This specification describes an LDAP extension for use in a controlled network environment,
		which does not have firewalls or Network Address Translators (NATs). For this reason,
		no considerations for NAT traversal, translator binding lifetimes, etc. are included
		in this specification.
