Abstract

   This document specifies a simple signalling mechanism for inter-
   domain QoS marking using a BGP Extended Community QoS Attribute.
   Class based packet forwarding for delay and loss critical services is
   currently performed in an individual AS internal manner.  The new QoS
   marking attribute makes the QoS class setup within the IP prefix
   advertising AS known to all access and transit ASes.  This enables
   individual (re-)marking and forwarding treatment adaptation to the
   original QoS class setup of the respective IP prefix.  The attribute
   provides the means to signal QoS markings on different layers, which
   are linked together in QoS class sets.  It provides inter-domain and
   cross-layer insight into the QoS class mapping of the source AS with
   minimal signalling traffic.

Internet-Draft          BGP QoS Marking Attribute              June 2008


1.  Introduction

   A new BGP Extended Community Attribute is defined in this document,
   which carries QoS marking information for different network layer
   technologies across ASes.  This attribute is called "QoS Marking
   Attribute".  This new attribute provides a mechanism for labelling
   priority class information carried in BGP-4 [RFC4271].  It allows for
   the consistent exchange of priority class encoding values between BGP
   peers for physical, data link, network and transport layer QoS
   mechanisms.  These labels can be used to control the distribution of
   this information, for the encoding and for treatment adjustments
   within the AS or for other applications.

   Several QoS Marking Attributes MAY be included in a single BGP UPDATE
   message.  Each QoS Marking Attribute is encoded as 8-octet tuple, as
   follows.


2.  Definition of the QoS Marking Attribute

2.1.  Extended Community Type

   The new QoS Marking Attribute is encoded as a BGP Extended Community
   Attribute [RFC4360].  It is therefore a transitive optional BGP
   attribute with Type Code 16.  An adoption to the simple BGP Community
   Attribute encoding [RFC1997] is not defined in this document.  The
   actual encoding within the BGP Extended Community Attribute is as
   follows.

   The QoS Marking Attribute is of regular type which results in a 1
   octet Type field followed by 7 octets for the QoS marking structure.
   The Type is IANA-assignable (FCFS procedure) and marks the community
   as transitive across ASes.  The type number has been assigned by IANA
   to 0xYY (0x00-x3f).
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |0 0 x x x x x x|                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   7 octet QoS Marking Attribute structure     |
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Note to RFC Editor: The actual type number needs to replace the '0xYY
   (0x00-x3f)' after the IANA assignment has occurred.

2.2.  Structure of the QoS Marking Attribute

   The QoS Marking Attributes provides a flexible encoding structure for
   various QoS Markings on different layers.  This flexibility is
   achieved by a Flags, a QoS Set Number and a Technology Type field
   within the 7 octet structure as defined below.
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    Flags      | QoS Set Number|        Technology Type        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | QoS Marking O | QoS Marking A |   P. Count    | C. Unused ='0'|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Flags:
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
   |L2 L1 L0|R |I |A |0 |0 |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

      All used and unused flags default to a value of '0'.  The
      following table shows the bit encoding of the Flags field.

   +-----+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | Bit | Flag      | Encoding                                        |
   +-----+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | 0-2 | L2 & L1 & | Specification of the applied enumeration list   |
   |     | L0        | for the Technology Type                         |
   | 3   | R         | '1' ... remarking occurred                      |
   | 4   | I         | '1' ... QoS marking ignored                     |
   | 5   | A         | '1' ... QoS class aggregation occurred          |
   | 6,7 | unused    | Default to '0'                                  |
   +-----+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+

      Technology Type Enumeration can be chosen from different sources
      as follows.

Internet-Draft          BGP QoS Marking Attribute              June 2008


      The Flags "R, I and A" are set to '0' in the advertisement by the
      IP prefix originating AS.  Transit ASes MUST change the flag value
      to '1' once the respective event occurred.  If the QoS marking
      actively used in the transit AS internal forwarding is different
      from the advertised original one, the 'Remarking (R)' flag is set
      to '1'.  This MUST be done separately for each technology type
      attribute within the attribute set.  The same applies to the
      'Ignore (I)' flag, if the respective advertised QoS marking is
      ignored in the transit AS internal forwarding.

      The 'Aggregation (A)' flag MUST be set to '1' by the UPDATE
      message relaying transit AS, if the respective IP prefixes will be
      advertised inside an IP prefix aggregate.

   QoS Set Number:

      Several single QoS Marking Attributes can be grouped logically
      into a QoS Marking Attribute Set characterized by a QoS Set
      Number.  This grouping of the single QoS Marking Attributes into a
      set provides a cross-layer linking between the QoS class
      encodings.  The number of signalled QoS Marking Attributes as well
      as QoS Marking Attribute Sets is at the operator's choice of the
      originating AS.  The enumerated QoS set numbers have BGP UPDATE
      message local significance starting with set number 0x00.

   Technology Type:

   The technology type encoding follows commonly used enumerations as
   referred to by the L2&L1&L0 bit combinations stated above.  If the
   use of external enumerations is not favoured or the mapping of
   commonly used technologies is sufficient, the enumeration list in
   (Section 2.3) SHALL be used.

   QoS Marking / Enumeration O & A:

   The interpretation of these identically approached fields depends on
   the selected layer and technology.  QoS mechanisms using bit
   encodings for the targeted priority (e.g.  IP DSCP, Ethernet User
   Priority, MPLS EXP etc.)  MUST use a copy of the encoding in this
   attribute field.  Unused higher order bits default to '0'.  Other
   technologies, which use other ways of labelling priority information
   such as L-LSPs, VPI/VCI inferred ATM classes, lambda inferred
   priority, etc.  SHALL use class enumerations as encoding in this
   attribute field.

   There are two QoS Marking fields within the QoS Marking Attribute for
   the "original (O)" and the "active (A)" QoS marking.

Internet-Draft          BGP QoS Marking Attribute              June 2008


   QoS Marking O (Original QoS Marking):

      The IP prefix originating AS copies the internally associated QoS
      encoding of the given Technology Type into this one octet field.
      The field MUST remain unchanged in BGP UPDATE messages of relaying
      nodes.

   QoS Marking A (Active QoS Marking):

      QoS Marking A and O MUST be identically encoded by the prefix
      originating AS.

      All other ASes use this Active QoS Marking field to advertise
      their internal QoS encoding of the given class and technology.  A
      cleared Marking field signals that this traffic class experiences
      default traffic treatment within the transit AS forwarding
      technology.

   Processing Count (P. Count):

      Each BGP instance, which processes the attribute and appends a
      different AS number to the AS_PATH, MUST increase this counter by
      one.  The attribute originating instance initializes the counter
      value to '0x00'.

   Currently Unused (C. Unused):

      This one octet field is currently unused and MUST be set to
      '0x00'.

2.3.  Technology Type Enumeration

   A small list of technologies is provided in the table below for the
   direct encoding of common technology types.

   +--------+------------------------------------+
   | Value  | Technology Type                    |
   +--------+------------------------------------+
   | 0x0000 | DiffServ enabled IPv4              |
   | 0x0001 | DiffServ enabled IPv6              |
   | 0x0010 | Ethernet using 802.1q priority tag |
   | 0x0020 | MPLS using E-LSP                   |
   | 0x0021 | MPLS using L-LSP                   |
   | 0x0100 | GMPLS - time slot encoding         |
   | 0x0101 | GMPLS - lambda encoding            |
   | 0x0102 | GMPLS - fibre encoding             |
   +--------+------------------------------------+

Internet-Draft          BGP QoS Marking Attribute              June 2008


3.  Attribute Usage

   Providers MAY choose to process the QoS Marking Attributes and adopt
   the priority encoding according to their local policy.  Whether this
   MAY also lead to different IGP routing decisions or even effect BGP
   update filters is out of scope for the attribute definition.

   Only the IP prefix originating AS is allowed to signal the QoS
   Marking Attributes and Sets.  Transit ASes MUST NOT modify or extend
   the QoS Set except for the update of each 'QoS Marking A' field
   contained in the Attribute Set, the respective "R, I, A" flags and
   the Processing Counter.

3.1.  QoS Marking Attribute Example

   See Appendix A for an example QoS Marking Attribute Set.

3.2.  AS Border Packet Forwarding

   IP packet forwarding based on packet header QoS encoding might
   require remarking of packets in order to match AS internal policies
   and encodings of neighbouring ASes.

   Identical QoS class sets and encodings between neighbouring ASes do
   not require any remarking.  Different encodings will be matched on
   the outgoing traffic.

   Outgoing traffic for a given IP prefix uses the 'QoS Marking A'
   information of the respective BGP UPDATE message QoS Marking
   Attribute for adopted remarking of the forwarded packet.

   If the Process Count is smaller than the number of different AS
   numbers in the AS PATH or if the 'I' flag is set for a given
   encoding, the outgoing traffic will be remarked using the 'QoS
   Marking O' information instead.

   'QoS Marking O' information is also used for outgoing remarking, if
   the targeted class is not supported by the neighbouring AS.

3.3.  IP Prefix Aggregation

   Several IP prefixes of different IP prefix originating ASes MAY be
   aggregated to a shorter IP prefix in transit ASes.  The QoS Marking
   Attribute Set of the resulting IP prefix aggregate is chosen as
   follows:

   1.  If only on aggregate member contains an associated QoS Marking
       Attribute Set, than this Set MUST be used as resulting QoS



Knoll                   Expires December 10, 2008               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          BGP QoS Marking Attribute              June 2008


       Marking Attribute Set for the IP prefix aggregate.

   2.  If several aggregate members contain an associated QoS Marking
       Attribute Set, than the Set of the shortest IP prefix aggregate
       member MUST be used as resulting QoS Marking Attribute Set for
       the IP prefix aggregate.  Equal IP prefix aggregate member
       lengths SHOULD be resolved in favour of the IP prefix with lower
       IP addresses.

   In case of IP prefix aggregation, the 'Aggregation (A)' flag of each
   QoS Marking Attribute within the Set MUST be set to '1'.


4.  Confidentiality Considerations

   The disclosure of confidential AS intrinsic information is of no
   concern since the signalled marking for QoS class encodings can be
   adopted prior to the UPDATE advertisement of the IP prefix
   originating AS.  AS internal cross-layer remarking and policy based
   update filtering allows for consistent QoS class support despite made
   up QoS class set and encoding information within UPDATE
   advertisements.  In case of such policy hiding strategy the required
   originating AS internal ingress and egress remarking SHALL be done
   transparently without explicit "Active Marking" and 'R' flag
   signalling.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP Extended Community Attribute, which
   needs to be assigned a number by IANA within the Extended Community
   Attribute list.

   The new QoS Marking Attribute is a BGP Extended Community Attribute
   of regular type.  It is IANA-assignable (FCFS procedure) and is
   transitive across ASes.

   An number assignment application within the numbering range of 0x00 -
   x3f is made to IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


6.  Security Considerations

   The new QoS marking Attribute does not raise extra security concerns.
   Existing BGP security measures are in place by means of the reused

   The example AS is advertising several IP prefixes, which experience
   equal QoS treatment from AS internal networks.  The IP packet
   forwarding policy within this originating AS defines e.g. 3 traffic
   classes for IP traffic (DSCP1, DSCP2 and DSCP3).  These three classes
   are also consistently taken care off within AS internal 802.1q
   Ethernet switches (using UPC1, UPC2 and UPC3) as well as within the
