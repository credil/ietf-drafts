1.  Introduction

   This document describes a convention for representing Delay-Tolerant
   Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol (BP) [RFC5050] endpoint identifiers
   in a compressed manner within the primary blocks of bundles.

   Each DTN bundle's primary block contains four BP endpoint identifiers
   (EIDs), of which any two, any three, or even all four may be
   lexically identical: the endpoint identifiers of the source, the
   destination, the report-to endpoint, and the current custodian.  Each
   EID is a Uniform Record Identifier (URI) as defined by [RFC3986].

   A degree of block compression is provided by the design of the
   primary block: the scheme names and scheme-specific parts of the four
   endpoints' IDs - up to eight NULL-terminated strings - are
   concatenated at the end of the block in a variable-length character
   array called a "dictionary", enabling each EID to be represented by a
   pair of integers indicating the offsets (within the dictionary) of
   the EID's scheme name and scheme-specific part.  Duplicate strings
   may be omitted from the dictionary, so the actual number of
   concatenated NULL-terminated strings in the dictionary may be less
   than eight and two or more of the scheme name or scheme-specific part
   offsets in the block may have the same value.  Moreover, the eight
   offsets in the primary block are encoded as self-delimiting numeric
   values (SDNVs), which shrink to fit the encoded values; when the
   total length of the dictionary is less than 127 bytes, all eight
   offsets can be encoded into just eight bytes.

   However, these strategems do not prevent the scheme names and scheme-
   specific parts themselves from being lengthy strings of ASCII text.
   It is therefore still possible for the length of a bundle's primary
   header to be a very large fraction of the total length of the bundle
   when the bundle's payload is relatively small, as is anticipated for
   a number of DTN applications such as space flight operations.

   The Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) convention was developed
   to improve DTN transmission efficiency for such applications by
   further reducing the number of bytes used to express EIDs in the
   primary blocks of bundles.


2.  Compression convention

2.1.  Constraints

   Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) is possible only when all
   endpoint IDs in the primary block of a given bundle are "CBHE-
   conformant".  Two forms of endpoint ID are CBHE-conformant: (a) the



Burleigh                Expires September 6, 2009               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                    CBHE                        March 2009


   null endpoint ID "dtn:none" and (b) any endpoint ID whose scheme name
   is "dtn" and whose authority component is "cbhe.ccsds.org".

   The specification for URIs formed within the "dtn" scheme requires
   that the path component of each such URI that is characterized by
   authority component "cbhe.ccsds.org" be a path-absolute of the form
   /NODE_NUMBER.SERVICE_NUMBER.

   By convention, node number is a natural number that identifies a BP
   node.  In a spacecraft flight operations context, for example,
   spacecraft identifier might be used as node number.

   Node number must be an integer in the range 1 to (2^64 - 1).  Node
   number zero is reserved for representation of the null endpoint ID in
   the compressed form described later in this specification;
   decompressing a compressed null EID must always yield the standard
   null endpoint ID URI "dtn:none".  Negative integers and integers
   larger than (2^64 - 1) cannot be compressed into the SDNVs that are
   used for representation of endpoint ID references in the primary
   blocks of bundles and therefore could not be compressed as described
   later.

   By convention, service number is a non-negative integer that
   functions as a de-multiplexing token.  When the protocol encapsulated
   within BP has its own de-multiplexing identifiers, the service number
   may function in a manner similar to that of the protocol number in an
   IP packet, characterizing the bundle payload; alternatively, the
   service number may function in a manner similar to that of the port
   number in a UDP datagram.  Service numbers enable inbound bundles'
   application data units to be de-multiplexed to instances of
   application functionality that are designed to process them, so that
   effective communication relationships can be developed between bundle
   producers and consumers.

   Service number zero is reserved for BP administrative traffic, i.e.,
   custody signals and bundle status reports.  Service number must be
   zero whenever a CBHE-conformant EID is used as the source or
   destination EID of a custody signal.  Service number may be zero
   whenever a CBHE-conformant EID is used as the source or destination
   EID of a bundle status report.  Service number must not be negative
   or exceed (2^64 - 1) for the same reason that node number must not do
   so.

   For example, "dtn://cbhe.ccsds.org/9.37" would be a CBHE-conformant
   endpoint ID.

   Conversion of a CBHE-conformant EID to and from a tuple of two
   integers is therefore straightforward.  This ease of conversion

   enables an array of integers to serve the same function as a
   dictionary of EID ASCII strings.

   Note, however, that CBHE decompression cannot faithfully recreate the
   dictionary of a compressed primary block from an array of integers
   unless the order of the endpoint ID reference strings in the
   dictionary of the original, uncompressed block is known.  (The bundle
   protocol specification does not require that the strings in the
   dictionary appear in any particular order and does not require that
   redundant strings be omitted from the dictionary.)  Therefore, a
   further precondition to CBHE block compression is that the endpoint
   ID reference strings in the dictionary of the bundle to be compressed
   must be as follows:

   1.  The scheme name of the destination endpoint ID.

   2.  The scheme-specific part of the destination endpoint ID.

   3.  The scheme name of the source endpoint ID, if and only if
       different from any prior string in the dictionary.

   4.  The scheme-specific part of the source endpoint ID, if and only
       if different from any prior string in the dictionary.

   5.  The scheme name of the report-to endpoint ID, if and only if
       different from any prior string in the dictionary.

   6.  The scheme-specific part of the report-to endpoint ID, if and
       only if different from any prior string in the dictionary.

   7.  The scheme name of the current custodian endpoint ID, if and only
       if different from any prior string in the dictionary.

   8.  The scheme-specific part of the current custodian endpoint ID, if
       and only if different from any prior string in the dictionary.

2.2.  Method

   When the constraints summarized above are met, the CBHE block
   compression method can be applied.  In a CBHE-compressed primary
   block, the eight SDNVs that normally contain EIDs' offsets within the
   dictionary are instead used to contain the eight integer values
   listed below, in the order shown:

   1.  The node number of the destination endpoint ID, or zero if the
       destination endpoint is the null endpoint.

Internet-Draft                    CBHE                        March 2009


   2.  The service number of the destination endpoint ID, or zero if the
       destination endpoint is the null endpoint.

   3.  The node number of the source endpoint ID, or zero if the source
       endpoint is the null endpoint.

   4.  The service number of the source endpoint ID, or zero if the
       source endpoint is the null endpoint.

   5.  The node number of the report-to endpoint ID, or zero if the
       report-to endpoint is the null endpoint.

   6.  The service number of the report-to endpoint ID, or zero if the
       report-to endpoint is the null endpoint.

   7.  The node number of the current custodian endpoint ID, or zero if
       the current custodian endpoint is the null endpoint.

   8.  The constant BP administration service number zero.

   Further, the dictionary is omitted from the primary block and the
   primary block's dictionary length is set to zero.

   This compression method is applied at the convergence layer: the
   transmitting convergence-layer adaptation compresses the primary
   block as shown above.  Upon reception the receiving convergence-layer
   adaptation de-compresses the block by simply reversing the process.


3.  Specification

   CBHE compression is a convergence-layer adaptation.  It is opaque to
   bundle processing.  It therefore has no impact on the
   interoperability of different Bundle Protocol implementations, but
   instead affects only the interoperability of different convergence
   layer adaptation implementations.

   Bundle Protocol convergence-layer adapters that conform to the CBHE
   specification must implement the following procedures.

3.1.  Transmission

   When and only when required by the bundle protocol agent to transmit
   to some CBHE-conformant convergence-layer adapter a bundle whose
   primary block's endpoint IDs satisfy the constraints identified in
   section 2.1 above and whose extension blocks (if any) contain no
   citations of endpoint IDs that are contained in the primary block's
   dictionary, the convergence layer adapter may encode the primary

   block of the bundle in accordance with the CBHE compression
   convention described in section 2.2 above.

3.2.  Reception

   Upon receiving a bundle whose dictionary length is zero (and only in
   this circumstance), the convergence layer adapter must decode the
   primary block of the bundle in accordance with the CBHE compression
   convention described in section 2.2 above before delivering it to the
   bundle protocol agent.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.


5.  Security Considerations

   CBHE introduces no new security considerations beyond those discussed
   in the DTN Bundle Protocol and Bundle Security Protocol
   specifications.
