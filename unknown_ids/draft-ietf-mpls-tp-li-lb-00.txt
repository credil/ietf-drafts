Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-tp-li-lb-00.txt       September 2010 
1. Introduction 

   In traditional transport networks, circuits are provisioned across   
   multiple nodes and service providers have the ability to operate the   
   transport circuit such as T1 line in loopback mode for management   
   purposes, e.g., to test or verify connectivity of the circuit up to a   
   specific node on the path of the circuit, to test the circuit 
   performance with respect to delay/jitter, etc. MPLS-TP bidirectional 
   LSP emulating traditional transport circuits need to provide the same   
   loopback capability.  The mechanisms in this document apply to 
   associated bidirectional paths as defined in [7], which include MPLS-
   TP LSPs, bi-directional RSVP-TE tunnels, pseudowires (PW), and Multi-   
   segment PWs. 

   To describe the loopback functionality, let us assume a bi-
   directional MPLS-TP LSP A <---> B <---> C <---> D where A, B, C, and 
   D are MPLS capable nodes. Also, let us assume that the network 
   operator requires C to loop, back to A, the packets sent from A. In 
   this example, A and D acts as Maintenance End Points (MEPs) and C 
   acts as a Maintenance Intermediate Point (MIP). The operator can 
   setup the MPLS-TP LSP into loopback mode such that C loops all the 
   packets (regardless of whether they are data or control packets) 
   generated by node A back to A. The packets are not also forwarded 
   towards D. Similarly, any traffic received by C from the reverse 
   direction will be dropped.  

   The operator must take the MPLS-TP LSP out of service before setting 
   up the MPLS-TP LSP in loopback mode. This is accomplished by the MEP 
   establishing the loopback first sending a Lock command to the remote 
   MEP(s). In the case above, A sends a Lock request message along the 
   MPLS-TP LSP and destined to D to lock the MPLS-TP LSP. The message 
   will be intercepted by D since it is at the end of the LSP. D 
   responds to the lock request with a reply message specifying whether 
   it can take the LSP out of service or not.  

   In order to set the MPLS-TP LSP in loopback mode, A sends a Loopback 
   request message to the MIP or MEP where the loopback is to be 
   enabled. In the above example, the MPLS TTL value is set so that the 
   message will be intercepted by C. 

   This message contains a request to instruct C to operate the 
   corresponding MPLS-TP LSP in Loopback mode. C responds to the 
   Loopback request with a reply message back to A to indicate whether 
   or not it has successfully set the MPLS-TP LSP into the loopback 
   mode. If the loopback cannot be set, the reply message would contain 
   an error code. Upon receiving such a reply to the loopback request, A 
   logs the event and takes further reporting actions as necessary.  If 
   the MPLS-TP LSP was previously locked, A sends another request 
   message to D to unlock it.

Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-tp-li-lb-00.txt       September 2010 
   If the loopback request can be performed, the input LSP from the 
   direction of A is directly cross-connected to the output LSP towards 
   A. All the packets generated by node A (data and control) are looped 
   back at C, excepting the case of TTL expiration.  

   When the loopback operation is no longer required, A sends a request 
   message to remove the loopback and thus restore the LSP to its 
   original forwarding state. In this example the MPLS TTL is set such 
   that this message is intercepted by C. It is expected that C sends a 
   reply back to A to with a return code either ACKing or NAK the 
   loopback removal request. Upon getting an ACK response to loopback 
   mode removal request, A sends another request message to unlock the 
   MPLS-TP LSP. The packet is intercepted by D as it is at the end of 
   the MPLS-TP LSP. 

   The proposed mechanism is based on a new set of messages and TLVs   
   which can be transported using one of the following methods: 

   (1) An in-band MPLS message transported using a new ACH code point, 
   the message will have different types to perform the loopback 
   request/remove and Lock/unlock functions, and may carry new set of 
   TLVs. 

   (2) A new set of TLVs which can be transported using LSP-Ping 
   extensions defined in [4], and in compliance to specifications [5]. 

   Method (1) and (2) are referred to as "in-band option" and "LSP-Ping   
   option" respectively in the rest of the document. 

   Conventions used in this document 

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [3].

3. MPLS-TP Loopback/Lock Mechanism 

   For the in-band option, the proposed mechanism uses a new code point   
   in the Associated Channel Header (ACH) described in [6].   

3.1. In-band Message Identification 

  In the in-band option, the MPLS-TP LI-LB channel is identified by the 
  ACH as defined in RFC 5586 [6] with the Channel Type set to the MPLS-
  TP LI-LB code point = 0xHH.  [HH to be assigned by IANA from the PW 
  Associated Channel Type registry]  The LI-LB Channel does not use ACH 
  TLVs and MUST not include the ACH TLV header. The LI-LB ACH 
   Channel is shown below. 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3

   Version: The Version Number is currently 1.  (Note: the version 
   number is to be incremented whenever a change is made that affects 
   the ability of an implementation to correctly parse or process the 
   request/response message. These changes include any syntactic or 
   semantic changes made to any of the fixed fields, or to any Type-
   Length-Value (TLV) or sub-TLV assignment or format that is defined at 
   a certain version number.  The version number may not need to be 
   changed if an optional TLV or sub-TLV is added.) 

   Message Type 

   Two message types are defined as shown below. 

                Message Type          Description 
                ------------          ------------- 
                         0x0          LI-LB request

   Operation 

   Four operations are defined as shown below. The operations can appear 
   in a Request or Response message.

                         0x3          Set_Loopback 
                         0x4          Unset_Loopback 
    

   Message Length 

   The total length of any included TLVs. 

   Sender's Handle 

   The Sender's Handle is filled in by the sender, and returned 
   unchanged by the receiver in the MPLS response message (if any).

   There are no semantics associated with this handle, although a sender 
   may find this useful for matching up requests with replies. 

   Message ID 

   The Message ID is set by the sender of an MPLS request message. It 
   MUST be copied unchanged by the receiver in the MPLS response message 
   (if any).  A sender SHOULD increment this value on each new message.  
   A retransmitted message SHOULD leave the value unchanged.

   A MEP includes a Lock Request TLV in the MPLS LSP Ping echo request 
   message to request the MEP on the other side of the MPLS-TP LSP to 
   take the LSP out of service.  

3.3.2. Unlock Request TLV

   The Unlock Request TLV is sent from the MEP which has previously sent 
   lock request. Upon receiving the LSP Ping Echo request message with 
   the unlock request TLV, the receiver MEP brings the MPLS-TP LSP back 
   in service.

   When a MEP wants to put an MPLS-TP LSP in loopback mode, it sends a 
   MPLS LSP Ping echo request message with Loopback Request TLV. The 
   message can be intercepted by either a MIP or a MEP depending on the 
   MPLS TTL value. The receiver puts in corresponding MPLS-TP LSP in 
   loopback mode.

   When loopback mode operation of an MPLS-TP LSP is no longer required, 
   the MEP that previously sent the MPLS LSP Ping echo request message 
   with a loopback TLV, sends another MPLS LSP Ping echo request message 
   with a Loopback Removal TLV. The receiver MEP changes the MPLS-TP LSP 
   from loopback mode to normal mode of operation.

   Mechanisms similar to PPP Chap can be used to authenticate the 
   Loopback request. A variable length key can be carried in an optional 
   authentication TLV which can be included in the MPLS OAM LSP Ping 
   echo request message containing a loopback request TLV or the LI-LB 
   Message. The use of authentication key is outside the scope of the 
   document. 

    

4. Loopback/Lock Operations 

4.1. Lock Request 

   Lock Request is used to request a MEP to take an MPLS-TP LSP out of 
   service so that some form of maintenance can be done.  

   The receiver MEP MUST send either an ACK or a NAK response to the 
   sender MEP. Until the sender MEP receives an ACK, it MUST NOT assume 
   that the receiver MEP has taken the MPLS-TP LSP out of service. A 
   receiver MEP sends an ACK only if it can successfully lock the MPLS-
   TP LSP. Otherwise, it sends a NAK. 

    

4.2. Unlock Request 

   The Unlock Request is sent from the MEP which has previously sent 
   lock request. Upon receiving the unlock request message, the receiver 
   MEP brings the MPLS-TP LSP back in service. 

   The receiver MEP MUST send either an ACK or a NAK response to the 
   sender MEP. Until the sender MEP receives an ACK, it MUST NOT assume 
   that the MPLS-TP LSP has been put back in service. A receiver MEP 
   sends an ACK only if the MPLS-TP LSP has been unlocked, and unlock 
   operation is successful. Otherwise, it sends a NAK.

4.3. Loopback Request 

 
   When a MEP wants to put an MPLS-TP LSP in loopback mode, it sends a 
   Loopback request message. The message can be intercepted by either a 
   MIP or a MEP depending on the MPLS TTL value. The receiver puts in 
   corresponding MPLS-TP LSP in loopback mode. 

   The receiver MEP or MIP MUST send either an ACK or NAK response to 
   the sender MEP. An ACK response is sent if the MPLS-TP LSP is 
   successfully put in loopback mode. Otherwise, a NAK response is sent. 
   Until an ACK response is received, the sender MEP MUST NOT assume 
   that the MPLS-TP LSP can operate in loopback mode. 

4.4. Loopback Removal 

    
   When loopback mode operation of an MPLS-TP LSP is no longer required, 
   the MEP that previously sent the Loopback request message sends 
   another Loopback Removal message. The receiver MEP changes the MPLS-
   TP LSP from loopback mode to normal mode of operation. 

   The receiver MEP or MIP MUST send either an ACK or NAK response to 
   the sender MEP. An ACK response is sent if the MPLS-TP LSP is already 
   in loopback mode, and if the MPLS-TP LSP is successfully put back in 
   normal operation mode. Otherwise, a NAK response is sent. Until an 
   ACK response is received, the sender MEP MUST NOT assume that the 
   MPLS-TP LSP is put back in normal operation mode. 

5. Data packets 

   Data packets sent from the sender MEP will be looped back to that 
   sender MEP. In order for the sender MEP node to make sure that no 
   data packets are dropped, each data MPLS packets may contain a 
   sequence-id right after the label stack.  A time-stamp fields in the 
   data packets can help calculate the Round trip delay of datapackets. 
   The Local Time-Stamp is set by the sender, and can be used to 
   calculate the round trip delay after the message is looped back.

6. Operation 

6.1. General Procedures 

   When placing an LSP into Loopback mode, the operation MUST first be 
   preceded by a Lock operation.  

   Sending LSP Ping Echo Request message with Loopback Request/Removal 
   or in-Band Loopback Request/Removal Message 

   The TTL of the topmost label is set as follows:- 

   If the target node is a MIP, the TTL MUST be set to the exact number 
   of hops required to reach that MIP. 

   If the target node is a MEP, the value MUST be set to at least the 
   number of hops required to reach that MEP. For most operations where 
   the target is a MEP, the TTL MAY be set to 255. 

   However, to remove a MEP from Loopback mode, the sending MEP MUST set 
   the TTL to the exact number of hops required to reach the MEP (if the 
   TTL were set higher, the Loopback removal message would be looped   
   back toward the sender). It is RECOMMENDED that the TTL be set to the 
   exact number of hops required to reach the MEP. 

6.2. Example Topology 

   The next four sections discuss the procedures for Locking, Unlocking, 
   setting an LSP into loopback, and removing the loopback.  The   
   description is worded using an example. Assume an MPLS-TP LSP 
   traverses nodes A <--> B <--> C <--> D.  We will refer to the 
   Maintenance Entities involved as MEP-A, MIP-B, MIP-C, and MEP-D 
   respectively.  Suppose a maintenance operation invoked at node A 
   requires a loopback be set at node C. To invoke Loopack mode at node 
   C, A would first need to lock the LSP. Then it may proceed to set the 
   loopback at C. Following the loopback operation, A would need to 
   remove the loopback at C and finally unlock the LSP. 

   The following sections describe MEP-A setting and unsetting a lock at   
   MEP-D and then setting and removing a loopback at MIP-C.

6.3. Locking an LSP 

   1. MEP-A sends an MPLS LSP Ping Echo request message with the Lock 
   TLV or an in-Band Lock request Message. Optionally, an authentication 
   TLV MAY be included. 

   2. Upon receiving the request message, D uses the received label 
   stack and the Target FEC/source MEP-ID to identify the LSP. If no 
   label binding exists or there is no associated LSP back to the 
   originator, the event is logged.  Processing ceases.  Otherwise the 
   message is delivered to the target MEP. 

   a. if the source MEP-ID does not match, the event is logged and 
   processing ceases. 

   b. if the target MEP-ID does not match, MEP-D sends a response with 
   error code 1. 

   MEP-D then examines the message, and: 

   c. if the message is malformed, it sends a response with error code 2 
   back to MEP-A. 

   d. if message authentication fails, it MAY send a response with error 
   code 4 back to MEP-A. 

   e. if any of the TLVs is not known, it sends a response with error 
   code 3 back to MEP-A. It may also include the unknown TLVs. 

   f. if the MPLS-TP LSP is already locked, it sends a response with         
   error code 5 back to MEP-A. 

   g. if the MPLS-TP LSP is not already locked and cannot be locked, it 
   sends a response with error code 7 back to A. 

   h. if the MPLS-TP LSP is successfully locked, it sends a response 
   with error code 0 (Success) back to MEP-A. 

   The response is sent using an MPLS LSP Ping echo reply with a 
   response TLV or an in-Band Lock response message. An authentication 
   TLV MAY be included. 

6.4. Unlocking an LSP 

   1. MEP-A sends an MPLS Echo request message with the unLock TLV or an 
   in-Band unLock request Message. Optionally, an authentication TLV MAY 
   be included. 

   2. Upon receiving the unLock request message, D uses the received 
   label stack and target FEC/source MEP-ID to identify the LSP. If no

   label binding exists or there is no associated LSP back to the 
   originator, the event is logged. Processing ceases. Otherwise the 
   message is delivered to the target MEP. 

   a. if the source MEP-ID does not match, the event is logged and         
   processing ceases. 

   b. if the target MEP-ID does not match, MEP-D sends a response with 
   error code 1. 

   MEP-D then examines the message, and: 

   c. if the message is malformed, it sends a response with error code 2 
   back to MEP-A. 

   d. if message authentication fails, it MAY send a response with error 
   code 4 back to MEP-A. 

   e. if any of the TLVs is not known, it sends a response with error 
   code 3 back to MEP-A. It may also include the unknown TLVs. 

   f. if the MPLS-TP LSP is already unlocked, it sends a response with         
   error code 6 back to MEP-A. 

   g. if the LSP is locked and cannot be unlocked, it sends a response         
   with error code 8 back to MEP-A. 

   h. if the LSP is successfully unlocked, it sends a response with 
   error code 0 (Success) back to MEP-A. 

   The response is sent using an MPLS LSP Ping echo reply with a 
   response TLV or an in-Band unlock response message. An authentication 
   TLV MAY be included. 

6.5. Setting an LSP into Loopback mode 

   1. MEP-A sends an MPLS LSP Ping Echo request message with the 
   loopback TLV or an in-Band Loopback request message. Optionally, an 
   authentication TLV MAY be included. 

   2. Upon intercepting the MPLS Loopback message via TTL expiration, C 
   uses the received label stack and target FEC/source MEP-ID to 
   identify the LSP. 

   If no label binding exists or there is no associated LSP back to the 
   originator, the event is logged. Processing ceases. 

   Otherwise the message is delivered to the target MIP/MEP - in this      
   case MIP-C.

   processing ceases. 

   b. if the target MIP-ID does not match, MIP-C sends a response with

   d. if the message authentication fails, it sends a response with 
   error code 4 back to MEP-A. 

   e. if any of the TLV is not known, C sends a response with error code 
   3 back to MEP-A. It may also include the unknown TLVs. 

   f. if the MPLS-TP LSP is already in the requested loopback mode, it 
   sends a response with error code 9 back to MEP-A. 

   g. if the MPLS-TP LSP is not already in the requested loopback mode 
   and that loopback mode cannot be set, it sends a response with error 
   code 11 back to MEP-A. 

   h. if the MPLS-TP LSP is successfully programmed into the requested  
   loopback mode, it sends a response with error code 0 (Success) back 
   to MEP-A. 

   The response is sent using an MPLS LSP Ping echo reply with a 
   response TLV or an in-Band Loopback response message. An 
   authentication TLV MAY be included. 

6.6. Removing an LSP from Loopback mode 

   1. MEP-A sends a MPLS LSP Ping Echo request message with the Loopback 
   removal TLV or an in-Band Loopback removal request message. 
   Optionally, an authentication TLV MAY be included. 

   2. Upon intercepting the MPLS Loopback removal message via TTL      
   expiration, C uses the received label stack and the target FEC/source 
   MEP-ID to identify the LSP. 

   If no label binding exists or there is no associated LSP back to      
   the originator, the event is logged. Processing ceases. 

   Otherwise the message is delivered to the target MIP/MEP - in this      
   case MIP-C. 

   a. if the source MEP-ID does not match, the event is logged and         
   processing ceases.

   b. if the target MIP-ID does not match, MIP-C sends a response with 
   error code 1 back to MEP-A. 

   MIP-C then examines the message, and: 

   c. if the message is malformed, it sends a response with error code 2

   e. if any of the TLV is not known, C sends a response with error code 
   3 back to MEP-A. It may also include the unknown TLVs. 

   f. if the MPLS-TP is not in loopback mode, it sends a response with 
   error code 10 back to MEP-A. 

   g. if the MPLS-TP LSP loopback cannot be removed, it sends a response 
   with error code 12 back to MEP-A. 

   h. if the MPLS-TP is successfully changed from loopback mode to 
   normal mode of operation, it sends a reply with error code 0 (Success 
   ) back to MEP-A. 

   The response is sent using an MPLS LSP Ping echo reply with a 
   response TLV or an in-Band Loopback removal response message. An 
   authentication TLV MAY be included.
