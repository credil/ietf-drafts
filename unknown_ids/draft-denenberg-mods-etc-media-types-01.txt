Abstract 

This document specifies Media Types for the following formats: MODS (Metadata Object 
Description Schema), MADS (Metadata Authority Description Schema), METS (Metadata 
Encoding and Transmission Standard), MARCXML (MARC21 XML Schema), and the SRU 
(Search/Retrieve via URL Response Format) Protocol response XML schema. These are all 
XML schemas providing representations of various forms of information including metadata 
and search results. 

1. Introduction 

The Library of Congress, on behalf of and in collaboration with various components of 
the metadata and information retrieval community, has issued specifications which 
define formats for representation of various forms of information including metadata 
and search results. This memo provides information about the Media Types associated 
with several of these formats, all of which are XML schemas. 

o MODS: Metadata Object Description Schema. 
An XML schema for a bibliographic element set that may be used for a variety 
of purposes, and particularly for library applications. 

o MADS: Metadata Authority Description Schema 
An XML schema for an authority element set used to provide metadata about 
agents (people, organizations), events, and terms (topics, geographics, genres, 
etc.). It is a companion to the MODS Schema. 

o METS: Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard 
An XML schema for encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural 
metadata regarding objects within a digital library. 

o MARCXML MARC21 XML Schema 
An XML schema for the direct XML representation of the MARC format (for 
which there already exists a media type, application/marc; see 
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2220.html.) By "direct XML representation" we 
mean that it encodes the actual MARC data within XML. (This is in contrast to 
MODS: MARC uses codes for its element names; MODS represents the same 
information but uses semantically meaningful names while MARCXML uses the 
MARC codes.) 

o SRU: Search/Retrieve via URL Response Format 
An XML schema for the SRU response. SRU is a protocol, and the media type 
sru+xml pertains specifically to the default SRU response. the SRU response 
may be supplied in any of a number of suitable schemas, RSS, ATOM, for 
example, and the client identifies the desired format in the request, hence the 
need for a media type. This mechanism will be introduced in SRU 2.0; in 
previous versions (that is, all versions to date; 2.0 is in development) all 
responses are supplied in the existing default format, so no media type was 
necessary. SRU 2.0 is being developed within OASIS.
