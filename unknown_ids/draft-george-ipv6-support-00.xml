    <abstract>
      <t>Given the global lack of available IPv4 space, and limitations in
      IPv4 extension and transition technologies, this document recommends
      that IETF formally require protocol work to be IP version agnostic or to
      explicitly include support for IPv6, with some exceptions.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-ipv6-required"></xref> gives guidance
      to implementers that IP-capable devices need to support IPv6, because
      global IPv4 exhaustion creates many circumstances where the use of IPv6
      will no longer be optional.</t>

      <t>In the above draft, IETF is making the recommendation that IP-capable
      devices need to support IPv6. Therefore, it is imperative that the
      protocols that result from IETF work enable implementers to follow that
      recommendation. This document provides explicit recommendations and
      guidance as to how IETF itself should handle future work to ensure that
      it can meet the requirements of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-intarea-ipv6-required"></xref>, especially "SHOULD NOT
      require IPv4 for proper and complete operation."</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>There are several terms used by this document and other standards
        work which have commonly-accepted meanings, but are not necessarily
        defined within IETF's current body of documents. Because this draft is
        recommending that exceptions are made for certain areas of IETF work,
        the authors felt it necessary to formally define these terms for
        improved clarity. </t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>IPv4-IPv6 Transition &ndash; network technologies that offer
            IPv6 support over an IPv4 network (e.g. <xref
            target="RFC4213">6in4</xref>, <xref
            target="RFC5214">ISATAP</xref>, <xref target="RFC5969">6RD</xref>,
            etc.)</t>

            <t>IPv4-IPv6 Coexistence &ndash; network technologies (e.g. <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite">DSLite</xref>, <xref
            target="RFC6264">CGN</xref>, etc.) that maintain support for
            legacy IPv4 devices and applications after IPv4 exhaustion.</t>

            <t>IPv4-IPv6 Interworking &ndash; network technologies (e.g. <xref
            target="RFC6146">NAT64</xref>) that allow IPv6-only devices to
            communicate with IPv4-only devices</t>

            <t>IP version agnostic - the idea that the implementation is at a
            higher layer than IP (layer 3) and therefore the use of IPv4 or
            IPv6 at the Network Layer should be transparent to the upper-layer
            implementation or protocol.</t>

            <t>IPv4-IPv6 Feature parity - the absence of gaps where
            functionality exists in IPv4 but has no equivalent in IPv6. Note
            that this does not mean a direct 1:1 relationship where every
            feature that exists in IPv4 will exist in IPv6. This is because
            IPv6 eliminates the need for some features that exist in IPv4,
            IPv4 supports some features that are no longer in use, and some
            existing IPv4 features are integrated into other parts of IPv6. In
            addition, as new features and implementations take advantage of
            the differences between IPv6 and IPv4, it is expected that IPv6
            will surpass IPv4 and feature parity will begin to swing in the
            other direction as the decision is made not to implement certain
            features and protocols in IPv4.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Additional terminology can be found in <xref
        target="I-D.arkko-ipv6-transition-guidelines"></xref></t>

        <t>[Authors' note: These are strawman definitions, probably need to be
        wordsmithed further. Also, we were unable to find an existing draft or
        RFC which defines these terms. If one exists, we are happy to
        reference that instead.]</t>

        <t>It is important to note that the protocols listed in this section
        are merely examples, and this is not intended to be an exhaustive list
        of the applications of each term. Ultimately the decision as to
        whether an IETF WG, protocol, or draft should remain focused primarily
        or exclusively on IPv4 remains with the appropriate ADs.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="simple_list" title="Requirements and Recommendation">
      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>Within the IETF, further development on protocols and
          applications that are IPv4 only SHOULD cease, except to address
          vital operational or security issues, to maintain support for
          existing IPv4-only applications during the transition to IPv6, or to
          update the protocol or application to support IPv6.</t>

          <t>This will enable IETF WGs to concentrate on work that is either
          IP version agnostic, explicitly supports both IPv4 and IPv6, or in
          some cases, targets only IPv6. The goal is to ensure IPv4-IPv6
          feature parity in most cases, and enable networks to operate
          seamlessly in any combination of IPv4-only, dual-stack, or IPv6-only
          as their needs dictate.</t>

          <t>New features and protocols SHOULD NOT be introduced for use as
          IPv4-only unless they are specifically in support of IPv4-IPv6
          transition, IPv4-IPv6 coexistence or IPv4-IPv6 interworking.</t>

          <t>A comprehensive list of needed parity items and enhancements for
          IPv6 is outside the scope of this document, but this document
          recommends that the charters and work items of currently active IETF
          Working Groups (WGs) be evaluated to ensure that they are supporting
          the goals of IPv4-IPv6 feature parity and elimination of any
          remaining places in IETF standards and protocols where IPv4 is
          required for complete and proper function.</t>

          <t>Put another way:</t>

          <t>IETF SHOULD continue to update IPv4-only protocols and features
          for vital operational or security issues.</t>

          <t>IETF work SHOULD continue on IPv4-IPv6 transition and IPv4-IPv6
          coexistence technologies as necessary.</t>

          <t>IETF work that is not related to the above exceptions MUST be IP
          version agnostic or MUST explicitly support IPv6.</t>

          <t>IETF work SHOULD continue to update IPv4-only protocols and
          applications to support IPv6 as necessary and appropriate.</t>

          <t>IETF work MAY support IPv6-only applications and protocols,
          especially in cases where supporting the protocol or feature in IPv4
          would be difficult or impossible.</t>

v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                      Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                      figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                      Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                      added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                      images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).  -->
