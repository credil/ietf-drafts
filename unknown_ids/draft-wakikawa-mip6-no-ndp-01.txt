Internet-Draft            HA Limited Proxy NDP                 July 2007


1.  Introduction

   In Mobile IPv6, one of design limitations is the use of Proxy
   Neighbor Discovery on Home Agent.  Mobile IPv6 uses the proxy
   Neighbor Discovery Protocol (proxy NDP) to intercept packets meant
   for mobile nodes on a home agent at a home link.  When the proxy NDP
   is used, a home prefix must be strictly configured at the physical
   link which the home prefix is defined in the Internet topology.
   Moreover, the performance of NDP may effect that of Mobile IPv6 if
   the number of mobile nodes are served by a home network prefix.

   Elimination of the Proxy NDP from Mobile IPv6 and NEMO may bring some
   advantages such as flexible home prefix configuration, reduction of
   NDP overhead, disengagement from the home link bandwidth.  In NEMO
   Working Group, [1] introduces various home prefix configurations such
   as the extended home prefix, the extended home prefix and the virtual
   home prefix.  Proxy NDP is useless specially when the extended home
   prefix is used.  Finally, the fact that packets are captured by NDP
   shows that the maximum bandwidth for all the mobile nodes are limited
   to the home link bandwidth.

   We introduce special use case for Monami6 work.  When a mobile node
   returns home with multiple interfaces, it can only activate either an
   interface attached to the home link or an interface attached to a
   foreign link [9].  If it tries to active both interfaces, the Home
   Agent and the Mobile Node will defend the Home Address by NDP
   simultaneously.  Consequently, it leads DAD problem.  This problem
   has been discussed on the Multiple Care-of Address Registration [2]
   in Monami6 Working Group.  By eliminating Proxy NDP, the mobile node
   can utilize both of interfaces attached to the home and the foreign
   link at the same time.

   This document shows the possible configuration and modification when
   a home agent stop the proxy NDP for Mobile IP and NEMO.  The Mobile
   Node is transparent to this NDP elimination, though it may skip
   several steps from returning home operation.

3.  Use Case

3.1.  Mobile IP6: Virtual Home Link

   The first case is that home prefix is configured as the virtual home
   link on Home Agent as shown in Figure 1.  The operator may choose
   this deployment scenario to reduce NDP overhead caused by number of
   Mobile Nodes at the home link.

   The home link is not configured at the physical link and all of the
   Mobile Nodes moves only in foreign links and never come back to the
   home link.  The Home Agent does not intercept packets from a Mobile
   Node on the home link by the Proxy NDP.  On the other hand, the Home
   agent intercepts all the packets sent by a Correspondent node.  The
   correspondent node is always located on the Internet (i.e. not home
   link).  To do so, the Home agent is configured as an external router
   at the routing functions in order to intercept packets without the
   proxy NDP.

   Even if the home link is configured at the physical link, the proxy
   NDP can be skipped.  This is also useful scenario for Mobile IP
   operators, because the performance of packet interception is released
   from the limitation of the home link bandwidth.  Even if the external
   link toward the Internet is high speed network like 10Gbps, the
   performance is limited to the home link bandwidth on the regular
   Mobile IP and NEMO.  The operator needs not to invest to the home
   link bandwidth with our modified operation.  In addition to this,
   plenty of Proxy NDP entries are burden to a Home Agent, if the number
   of Mobile Nodes are served by the Home Agent.  Our proposal can
   remove this burden from the Home Agent.

   For this operation, the Home Agent SHOULD send Router Advertisements
   which on-link flag is unset.  A node receiving the Router
   Advertisements does not maintain a prefix route (on-link route) and
   always uses a default route to send packets.  Even if a destination
   node is on-link node, the node sends packets through its default
   route (i.e.  Home Agent in this case).  The detail operation is
   explained in Section 5.2.

3.2.  Network Mobility: Aggregated Home Link

   The NEMO specification [6] allows that a home link is configured as
   the aggregated home prefix.  The Home Agent manages the aggregated
   network address blocks and assigns an internal network prefix(es) to
   a Mobile Router as shown in Figure 2.  In such a deployment scenario,
   the Home Agent cannot intercept the packets meant for the mobile
   network prefix by the proxy NDP, because the Proxy NDP assumes 64
   prefix length on a link.  This is not explicitly described in the NDP
   specification, but the NDP specification implies this.  It is
   necessary for Home Agent to intercept the packets without using Proxy
   NDP.

   It is also useful that the Home Agent is configured as an external
   router of the aggregated home networks and the Home Agent intercepts
   packets according to the IP routing.  After the Home Agent receives
   packets meant for the mobile network prefix, it routes packets based
   on binding caches to the target mobile router.

3.3.  Monami6: Simultaneous Use of Home and Foreign Link

   According to the Multiple Care-of Address Registration [2], when a
   multihomed mobile node returns home, it MUST choose one operation
   from following options:

   o  The mobile node returns home by an interface attached to the home
      link.  It de-registers all its bindings from the Home Agent.
      After the de-registration, the mobile node sends and receives all
      the packets via the interfaces attached to the home link.

   o  The mobile node does not return home and intentionally disables
      the interfaces attached to the home link.  The mobile node sends
      and receives all its packets via the interfaces attached to
      foreign links.

   The current specification does not allow to maintain multiple
   bindings that one is attached to the home link and the other is
   attached to the foreign link simultaneously.  This restriction is
   related to the Proxy NDP operation on a Home Agent.  The Home Agent
   needs to defend a mobile node's home address by the proxy NDP for
   packet interception, while the mobile node defends its home address
   by regular NDP to send and receive packets at the interface attached
   to the home link.  Two nodes, Home Agent and Mobile Node, compete ND
   state.  This will causes address duplication problem at the end.

   This document recommends not to use the Proxy NDP for the scenario
   shown in Figure 3.  If the proxy NDP is disabled, the main problem
   can be solved.  In the Multiple Care-of Address Registration case,
   the elimination of Proxy NDP enable that Mobile Node and Home Agent
   maintain multiple bindings, one of the Mobile Node's interface is
   attached to the home link and the other is attached to the foreign
   link.

4.  Home Agent Configuration

   In Mobile IPv6 and NEMO, two possible placements of Home Agents are
   originally introduced.  The difference between them is whether the
   Home Agent acts as an external router or not as shown in Figure
   Figure 4.

   In this document, HA is always an external router so that it can
   intercept all the packets meant for mobile nodes without the proxy
   neighbor discovery protocol.  The Home Agent intercepts packets
   according to the IP routing.  All the packets toward the home prefix
   will be routed to the Home Agent first.  When the Home Agent receives
   packets meant for the home prefix, it then route packets based on
   routing information and binding cache to the target mobile node.  If
   a binding cache is found for the packets' destination, it then
   tunnels the packets to the mobile node according to the binding cache
   entry.  Otherwise, the Home Agent routes packets to the home link.

             |          |  Home Link            |    Home Link
        -----+----------+-----------       -----+-------------



                      Figure 4: Home Agent Placements

   Note that there is one drawback when a HA is placed as an external
   router.  Operators cannot utilize multiple home agents for a same
   home prefix at a home link as introduced in [7].  Since the home
   agent intercepts packets based on IP routing, it must be external
   router.  It is harder to achieve load-balancing by utilizing multiple
   home agents on the home link.  However, for the purpose of the home
   agent reliability, the Home Agent Reliability protocol can be
   operated with the specific configuration in Figure 5.  In this case,
   upper router can switch the routing based on the HA survivability as
   shown in Figure 5

5.  Home Agent Operation

5.1.  Duplicate Address Detection

   RFC3775[7] uses the Proxy NDP to defend a Home Address of a Mobile
   Node when the Mobile Node is away from the Home Link.  When the
   Mobile Node is away from the Home and registers its Care-of Address
   to the Home Agent, the Home Agent defends the Home Address by the
   proxy NDP for the Home Address.  Thus, non of other nodes can pick
   the Home Address at the Home Link even if the Mobile Node is not
   visible on the Home Link.

   When the Proxy NDP is eliminated specially on a physical configured
   home link, the uniqueness of a home address should be carefully
   verified.  If a Mobile Node is away from the Home, its home address
   can be picked by other Mobile Nodes on the Home Link because of no
   Proxy ND entry of the Home Address.  To prevent address duplication,
   the Home Agent can filter the packets originated from the Home Link
   based on the Binding Cache.  Since the Home Agent is an external
   router, all the traffic is passed through the Home Agent.  When the
   Home Agent intercepts packets from the Home Link and finds an active
   binding cache entry for the same address with the packet's source
   address, it can drop packets.  For incoming packets, the Home Agent
   can prioritize the binding cache database first and can tunnel
   packets to the Mobile Node.  The packets are never reached to the
   malicious node who takes the home address of other mobile nodes.

   As a result, although a third node (malicious node) can obtain a home
   address which is already taken by other Mobile Node, it cannot send
   and receive packets by using the home address.

5.2.  Sending Router Advertisement

   The Home Agent SHOULD send a Router Advertisement to the Home Link
   for two purposes: address assignment and home link detection.  The
   Mobile Node generates a home address from the received router
   advertisement.  It also uses this to detect the home link.

   In this document, the Home Agent MUST route all the incoming and
   outgoing packets of the home link.  For communication with a
   Correspondent Node located on the home link, the packets MUST be
   routed via the Home Agent.  Otherwise, a malicious node can steal a
   Home Address of the other Mobile nodes and communicates with
   Correspondent nodes located on the Home Link by using the stolen Home
   Address (HoA1) as shown in Figure 6.  If the packet is always routed
   to the Home Agent first, the packets sent by Correspondent Node will
   be routed correctly to the right Mobile Node.

                  CN           Malicious (HoA1)


      Figure 6: Malicious Node communicating with CN on the home link

   For doing so, the Home Agent MUST generate Router Advertisement which
   the on-link flag (L flag) [8] is unset, so that all the packets will
   be routed via the Home Agent.  Malicious nodes may directly route the
   packets with the stolen home address, but packets sent by
   Correspondent Node will reach to the right Mobile Node.

   Moreover, when the Home Agent receives packets which destination and
   source are both located on the home link, it MUST NOT generate ICMP
   redirect to the sender.

5.3.  Deliverying Packets to the Mobile Node

   Although the Home Agent intercepts packets by IP routing, how to
   tunnel packets to the Mobile Node is same as [7].  The Home Agent
   refers the Binding Cache and encapsulates packets according to the
   binding cache entry.

   If a correspondent node is located at the home link, the node routes
   packets to the Home Agent first because the on-link flag of Router
   Advertisement is unset (See Section 5.2.  The Home Agent intercepts
   packets and tunnels packets to the Mobile Node only when the binding
   cache entry for the packet's destination is available.  Otherwise, it
   can re-send the packet to the Home Link.  In this case, the Home
   Agent MUST NOT generate ICMP Redirect message to the sender.

5.4.  Filtering Packets for Home Addresses

   The Home Agent MUST operate the binding de-registration carefully if
   the Proxy NDP is disabled on a physical home link.  As soon as a
   Mobile Node returns home, the Mobile Node can do DAD before binding
   update for de-registration.  It means the Home Agent cannot
   distinguish whether either a right Mobile Node or a malicious node

   packets of a Home Address during binding cache of the Home Address is
   active so that it drops packets when the malicious node acquires the
   Home Address of other Mobile Node.

   All traffic is through the Home Agent (see Section 5.2), the Home
   Agent MUST drop all the packets originated from the Home Link unless
   the binding is deleted.  When the binding is active, any packets
   which source address is the Home Address MUST NOT generate from the
   Home Link.  For incoming packets from the external network (ex.
   Internet), the Home Agent MUST NOT route the packets meant for a Home
   Address to the Home Link when the binding cache for the Home Address
   is active.  If the packets meant for the Home Address are arrived
   from a Correspondent Node located on the Home Link, it can tunnel
   packets to the Mobile Node according to the Binding Cache.
   Otherwise, it can routes packets to the Mobile Node located on the
   Home Link.  Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the example routing rules of
   the Home Agent.


       HoA:= Home Address
       BC:= Binding Cache for HoA
       source:= IPv6 Source Address Field
       dest:= IPv6 Destination Address Field

       If (BC == true) {
          if (source == HoA) {
              /* drop the packet */
          } else if (dest == HoA) {
              /* tunnel the packet */
          }
       } else if (BC == None) {
          if (source == HoA) {
