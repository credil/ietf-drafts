SIPNAT has been proposed as an effective method for
enabling global Internet access to IPv6-only domains.  New
methods have been devised for accurate delivery of packets from
the global Internet into the internal domain of destinations that
do not share a common address space with the majority of
the global Internet.  These improvements can be used to augment
Source-IP NAT so that perfect accuracy can be achieved in many
common cases of interest.

<!--IPv4 - ->IPv6 incoming NAT -->

<t>
Enabling the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 will depend
to a large extent upon how well businesses and online
organizations can depend on IPv6 to carry on their
daily operations.  One way to justify such dependence
on IPv6 is to assure businesses that their online services
will be accessible from the entire existing IPv54 Internet.
</t>

<t>
With traditional port-mapped NAT (NAPT), this has not
been possible because, for each source-destination flow,
the translation parameters for the flow have had to be
established by the internal network node (i.e., the node
with the IP address that is incompatible with the
addressing domain of the global Internet).  In particular,
for each such flow there needs to be an external IP address
and an external port assigned.  Packets arriving at the
external IP address and port are then translated and
retransmitted with new IP headers containing the translated
IP address and port number.  This works for IPv6-->IPv4
translation, IPv4-->IPv4 translation (e.g., today's
Internet), and other variations as well.  It is a workable
solution (with various second-order difficulties) for
enabling outgoing traffic to be delivered into the
global Internet.
</t>

<t>
But any business requires global presence and continuous,
on-demand availability.
The customers have to be able to initiate
contact with the business services, not the other way
around.  Similary for all
other online service organizations (including governmental,
non-profit, and family websites).
</t>

<t>

One idea for enabling such incoming translations has
been proposed, called "source-IP NAT"
(SIPNAT)<!--xref target="I-D.perkins-sourceipnat" /-->.  This
proposal relies on DNS to establish the required parameters
for the flow translation.  It has the advantage of dynamic
allocation and deallocation of global IPv4 addresses for
the potentially huge population of internal (say, IPv6)
network nodes.  This is essential for scalability.  The
more global IPv4 addresses, the better SIPNAT works.
With as few as 128 IPv4 addresses, SIPNAT can offer
reliability in excess of 99.99%, depending on the
arrival rate for new flows, the cohesiveness of each
flow, and other details about the statistics of the
incoming traffic.
</t>

<t>

There are other protocol-specific mechanisms that can
be used to assist with the translation of incoming traffic.
For almost all HTTP traffic, the translation can be
perfect.  For SIP and peer-to-peer traffic, other mechanisms
can often be employed.  For some traffic, there may not
be any additional mechanisms that are conveniently realizable,
or even available at all.  For example, "ping" and "telnet"
do not make available the information needed for the
protocol mechanisms in this document.

</t>
</section>

<section anchor='problems' title='Failure cases for SIPNAT'>



<t>
SIPNAT relies on DNS Request messages to initialize a pending flow
translation.  The pending flow translation will become established
when the first packet of the flow arrives at the external
IP address on the NAT box which has been allocated for that flow.
The process of establishment mainly involves inserting
the source IP address of that first packet as part of the
parameters for the flow translation.  This also enables
correct synthesis of the translated IPv6 address that
will be reported to the destination, and defines the
IPv4 source address for responses that are transmitted by
the IPv6 destination to be translated by the source-IP NAT.
</t>

<t>
The newly allocated IP address may already be supporting
several (or many) existing established flows; at any particular
time, SIPNAT requires that only one pending flow translation
may await establishment at the allocated IPv4 address.
Because of this, SIPNAT (while effective and generally robust)
does have failure modes.

   <list style="symbols">
   <t>
	   The DNS Request does not identify the actual source computer.
  This means the initial allocation for global Internet
  address on the NAT cannot be established until a packet arrives
  from the actual source.  It is then possible for a flow translation
  to be assigned on a global Internet address that already is hosting
  a previous flow translation for the same requesting source-IP address.
  In other words, it is possible for a source node, which is already
  getting service from the NAT at a particular IPv4 address, to be
  accidentally allocated that same IPv4 address for a different
  internal destination.  But, according to the rules of SIPNAT,
  two different IPv6 destinations for the same global Internet source
  cannot be translated through the same NAT IPv4 address.
   </t>
   <t>
	   Each IPv4 NAT interface to the global Internet can sustain
  only one pending assignment.  If too many new DNS resolutions
  arrive nearly simultaneously, new flow allocations
  may temporarily become unavailable.
   </t>
   <t>
  It is possible for a flow to persist even after the
  IPv4 address allocated for the flow has timed out.
  For such flows, incoming packets may be lost.  To
  counter this, flow timeouts should be set as long as
  possible consistent with the target error rate.  This
  amounts to a trade-off against the likelihood that the
  same source-IP address will request a new flow before
  all of its previous flows at the allocated NAT IP address
  have completed (and their flow translation parameters
  deactivated)
   </t>
   </list>

</t>

<t>
The SIPNAT document describes how to reduce or eliminate these
vulnerabilities by appropriate configuration and adjustments
for the timeout parameters.  The first case is the most difficult
case for SIPNAT.  Fortunately, according to traffic flows that have
been analyzed to date, this almost never happens for small-to-medium
scale websites that constitute the main use case for SIPNAT.  This
case does happen for very large servers, but even then it is rare,
and such servers would be more efficiently
handled by IVI <xref target="I-D.xli-behave-ivi" />.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor='payload' title='Using the Payload'>


<t>
The basic proposal in this document is to use information
contained in the payload to assist in translating the
IP header from the global Internet for better-assured
delivery to the proper internal host.  This goes beyond
previous suggestions for careful configuration and
management of the NAT interface.
</t>

<t>

For instance, almost all HTTP GET traffic has the host
destination host name as part of the HTTP payload:
   <list style="hanging">
   <t>
	http.host: news.google.com
   </t>
   <t>
	http.host: my-IPv6-server.example-operator.com
   </t>
   </list>
</t>

<t>

For all such incoming traffic, translation can be
performed with 100% accuracy.  Current experience with
border routers offering DPI features indicates that the
translation can be done at wire speed.  It is expected
that this one simple observation will, for all practical
purposes, eliminate any remaining ambiguities about the
delivery of HTTP traffic.
</t>

<t>

Even in the unlikely event that the "http.host" field is
not present in the HTTP GET traffic, web traffic offers
other possibilities for guiding correct traffic.  For
example, the pathname of the object webpage is typically
unique to the destination.  In other words, it is rarely
the case that two different destinations in the same domain
would use the same pathname to identify any webpages hosted
by those destinations.  If a database of associations between
pathnames and actual destinations is maintained, any such
traffic containing the pathname for a destination can
be delivered correctly.  Information about rare cases where
duplicate pathnames occur can also be maintained.  Even if
the pathname can narrow down the selection to a choice between
a few competing websites, the other context for the flow
translation will typically be sufficient for accurate
delivery.
</t>

<t>

Other protocols, such as SIP, also typically utilize URIs
and URLS that provide domain names identifying the
desired destination.  For each such protocol, the DPI
methods required for extracting the destination information
will be different, but the principle is the same.

</t>

</section>

<section anchor='p2p' title='Peer-to-Peer'>


<t>
After HTTP traffic, the next major source of traffic on the
Internet is Peer-to-Peer traffic.   This is typically filesharing
traffic, often using the BitTorrent protocol.  In order to
understand the interactions of such traffic with SIPNAT, we
will use BitTorrent as an example.
</t>

<t>

BitTorrent relies on four different kinds of protocol entities.
   <list style="symbols">
   <t> Directory of trackers </t>
   <t> Trackers </t>
   <t> Servers </t>
   <t> Clients </t>
   </list>

</t>
<t>

A client uses some method for finding a tracker that maintains
information about servers offering a particular file of interest.
Once contact with a tracker is established, the client obtains
a list of file segments, and for each file segment, a list of
servers that offer availability for that file segment.  A client
can select one or more servers for each segment of the desired
file.  If a transfer for a specific file segment from one of the
selected servers does not complete, the client can pick another
server for that file segment.  Eventually, all segments will be
collected together for assembly into the complete file of interest.
</t>

<t>

With this as context, it should be considered which configurations
are of most interest.  For example, consider an IPv6-only server
offering segments to clients on the global Internet.  In many cases,
this sort of service will work just fine, especially if the clients
attempt to resolve the server's domain name before issuing the
request for the file segment.  However, the tracker often
supplies the IP address of the server instead of the server's domain 
name.  For such communications, the client would expect to make
contact with the server without any intermediate DNS resolution
to obtain the IP address of the server.  In this case, the SIPNAT
would not have the opportunity to allocate the necessary IPv4
address for the flow translation.
</t>

<t>

Nevertheless, it is still possible to handle such incoming traffic,
based on detailed methods for inspecting peer-to-peer traffic
payloads.  This is to be specified in a companion ALG document
describing mechanisms for handling IPv4-->IPv6 translation for
the lists of servers provided by trackers.  One simple solution
is just to set up IVI-style network interfaces for the servers.
For dynamic allocations of IPv4 network interfaces on the NAT
router, additional payload inspection and alterations are needed.

</t>

</section>

<section anchor='other' title='Other traffic'>


<t>
Aside from HTTP, peer-to-peer, and SIP traffic, other protocol
services should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
</t>

<t>

For instance, DNS traffic is extremely common on the Internet.
However, it is most likely not a suitable candidate for such
protocol translations as typically handled by NATs.  Therefore,
for the purposes of this document, we may consider DNS traffic
to be out of scope for the translation problem.
</t>

<t>

Mobile IP signaling is not a good candidate for such protocol
translations, because a client is either a Mobile IPv4 mobile
node or a Mobile IPv6 mobile node, and there are already methods
specified by which a Mobile IPv6 mobile node can access its
home agent by way of IPv4 addresses.
</t>

<t>

It needs to be determined whether or not mail servers that have
IPv6 addresses only should be accessible by way of SIPNAT.
It seems more likely, even if they should be accessible at
all to the existing IPv4 global Internet, they would be either
dual-stack already, or else good candidates for assignment of a
permanent (IVI-style) IPv4 address on the NAT.
</t>

<t>

FTP does not seem to offer a good way to identify the destination
by way of the payload-oriented mechanisms described earlier
in this document.  Such FTP services are better handled by way
of IVI-style static address assignment.  For most of the cases
of interest, file access is more likely mediated by HTTP access
instead of FTP, and the remaining cases are typically those
more appropriate for static assignment anyway.
</t>

<t>
	Telnet is not used very often any more, and anyway is likely
	to be handled very well by SIPNAT except for cases when the
	client attempts to contact a destination by using the raw IP
	address.  SIPNAT does not offer a solution for that case.
</t>

<t>
	IKEv2 <xref target="RFC4306"/>
	has been designed to work across NAT boundaries.
	Consequently, it does not require the use of IP
	addresses as part of the IKEv2 message payload.
	In the case of SIPNAT, the Notify payloads NAT_DETECTION_SOURCE_IP
	and NAT_DETECTION_DESTINATION_IP will correctly indicate the
	presence of address translation.  If use of a well-known
	IPv6 prefix is used to translate the IPv4 address, there
	may be an opportunity to precisely identify the type of
	NAT as "SIPNAT".

<section anchor='seg' title='Segregation by access type'>


<t>

HTTP is a particularly common case that is easy for SIPNAT to
handle with the extensions described in this document.  For
destinations that only offer services by way of HTTP, all
traffic can be delivered accurately based on the payload.
This means that many different allocations could be made at
the same time without danger of ambiguity.  Effectively, the
restriction for only one pending allocation at a time could
be removed.
</t>

<t>

Suppose, then, that there is a special class of destinations
that only offer HTTP service.  Also suppose that the NAT
is equipped to detect the "http.host" field of incoming HTTP GET
requests.  For every destination in this special class, each
DNS Request could return the same IPv4 address in the DNS Reply.
The same sort of flow translation would be set up for each
HTTP destination assigned to the IPv4 address, but the 
destination IP address parameter would be determined by the 
payload, and matched against the initial allocation as determined
by the DNS entity.  However, packet delivery should still be
granted only for destinations that had been allocated to the
IPv4 address by way of a preceding DNS request.  This
eligibility requirement should be a matter of operator
policy.  For such traffic, the flow timeout parameter could
be configured to a much larger value.
</t>

<t>

This scheme could potentially be extended to allow HTTP access to
some destinations identified by IP address (not hostname) in URLs.
In other words, the pathname is located at a raw IP address
instead of the usual domain name for the destination node.
For these cases, the payload can be delivered accurately, but
no DNS Request would be received to trigger the allocation
of a pending flow translation.
</t>

<t>

Such unusual URLs can be supported under the typical
configuration choice for HTTP servers as has been described.
Again, it is a matter for operator choice whether it should
be appropriate to provide that support.  Moreover, it is not
clear how a source would ever get such a URL with an IPv4 address
to represent the IPv6-only destination.
