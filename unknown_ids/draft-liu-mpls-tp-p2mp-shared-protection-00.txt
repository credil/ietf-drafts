 Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile P2MP Shared Protection
              draft-liu-mpls-tp-p2mp-shared-protection-00

Abstract

   this document is used to update the former version 00 of
   draft-liu-mpls-tp-p2mp-share-protection-00. according to protection
   Requirements in RFC 5654 and draft-ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk WG draft.
   there are the following requirements : requirement 69 : MPLS-TP MUST
   support sharing of protection resources such that protection paths
   that are known not to be required concurrently can share the same
   resources.another requirment 67B : MPLS-TP must support
   unidirectional 1:n protection for P2MP ,so this document will
   describle and provide two protection solutions to protect P2MP path
   when there is a failure in the p2mp path.


   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
   Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
   Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include
   an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
   to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
   network as defined by the ITU-T.

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP P2MP shared protection         October 2010


1.  Introduction

   this document mainly introduces and describles individually 1:n and
   (1:1)^n protection solution for P2MP path, one scheme is based on
   extending 1:1 protection solution to implement 1:n protection by
   shared protection p2mp path when there may be a fault or detect in a
   working p2mp path.another scheme is using shared P2P protection
   Tunnel to protect and recovery one branch path of P2MP working path
   when there are some defects and failures in some branch paths of p2mp
   working path to implement (1:1)^n protection. and both scheme of
   protection and recovery can be satisfied and suitable for requirement
   69 and 67B in RFC 5654; while there only have 1+1 and 1:1 protection
   solution for P2MP path in draft-ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk and
   draft-ietf-mpls-tp-linear-protection-01. if 1+1 protection is only
   used for P2MP path, it must set up a disjoint protection path for
   each working path, so it will add the cost of maintenancing and
   monitoring each path. at the same time, since the p2mp service must
   be transported in both working and protection path, doule bandwidth
   resource will be consumed for a p2mp service . so it is very
   necessary to consider sharing protection resource among some working
   paths.

3.  P2MP Shared protection solution

   this section mainly describles two kinds of P2MP shared protection
   solutions, the first solution will apply one P2MP protection path to
   protect n P2MP working paths which may have different root node and
   branch nodes or have the same root node and differenet branch nodes
   .when a protected P2MP path has defect , the branch node of the P2MP
   path will notify and coordinate the switch state by state control
   packet include PSC or APS etc between root node and all branch nodes.
   if there is no other higher priority protected P2MP path or control
   command to need to be protected,the defective p2mp service packet
   will switch into P2MP protection path to be transported. and all
   branch nodes of the defective P2MP path will select protection path
   to receive P2MP service packets.

   The second scheme will use P2P protection tunnel to protect defective
   branch path of many protected P2MP paths, when a failure or defect
   can happen in a branch path of P2MP working path . the branch node
   which has already detected the defect or failure will notify and
   request root node of working path or protection path about the
   failure message and state through in-band or out-of-band return path
   .so the service will switch into protection path or bridge both
   working path and protection path to be carried and transported.and
   the branch node of the defective p2mp path will select protection P2P
   tunnel to receive the P2MP service packet. the two p2mp shared
   protection solutions will implement 1;N and (1:1)^n protection, and
   the following section will describe the course of protection
   switching in detail.

3.1.  1:n protection

   This solution should be similar to 1:1 protection solution to use one
   protection path to protect more one working path. firstly the P2MP
   protection path will be configured and set up between the protection
   root node and all leaf nodes of protected P2MP paths by static

   configuration or dynamically configuration. and root node of each
   working P2MP path will send detection packet to all its own branch
   nodes periodly. when a branch node of the p2mp path can't receive the
   detection packet in a fixed time. the branch node would generate
   failure notify message packet to notify the root node of the P2MP
   working path or the P2MP protection path by state control packet
   including PSC or APS through in-band or out-of-band return path, when
   the root node of P2MP working path received the failure notify
   message and knew some failure in one or more one branch paths of the
   P2MP path. so it may send protection switch requirement control
   packet to root node of protection path or client node. when the root
   node of protection path received protection switch requirement
   control packet from all other root nodes of defect P2MP working path
   or branch nodes of defect branch paths. it should be based on the
   priority of all protected P2MP paths and select a P2MP service which
   is the highest priotity among these failure paths to be protected .
   then the root node of protection path will generate a notify message
   include selected P2MP path identifier in state control packet by TLV
   format .the state control packet of the notify message format is as
   the following: .



             0                   1                   2             3

   After the root node of protection path generates the notify message
   packet. it will send the State control packet to the root node of
   each failure p2mp working path and all leaf nodes of the P2MP
   protection path. the root node of each failure p2mp working path
   maybe receive and processe the state control packet. if the p2mp path
   which to be selected to be protected is local node's p2mp path, the
   root node will firstly send the p2mp service packet to the root node
   of protection path. or else, The root node won't do this.  For all
   branch nodes of protection path, when they received and processed the
   state control packet. they will be based on P2MP Path Identifier
   value to decide whether to receive and process the service packet
   from p2mp protection path later.if the branch node can't be branch
   node of the p2mp path which to be protected , it will not process the
   service packet and abandon the packet. or else, it will receive and
   process the packet.in addtion,the root node of protection path maybe
   receive p2mp service directly from client node and transport them to
   all branch nodes of all p2mp working path which can be protected by
   the p2mp protection path.

   the implement in detail as the following figure is 1:2(n=2)
   protection instance.

   For above p2mp network topology , there are two different p2mp
   services which need to be carried and transported separately by p2mp
   working path 1( r1-p2mp path 1-L1,L2,L3)and p2mp working path 2(r2-
   p2mp path 2-L3,L4) under normal state. one p2mp service will be sent
   and transported to branch nodes L1,L2,L3, and another p2mp service
   will be sent and transported to branch nodes L3,L4. and a p2mp
   protection path ( P-protection path-L1,L2,L3,L4) is used to protect
   p2mp working path 1 and p2mp working path 2 by static configuration
   or dynamically configuation. and the priority of p2mp working path 1
   is higher than p2mp working path 2. if there is a failure in
   separately branch path(r1-p2mp path 1-L1) of p2mp working path 1 and
   branch path(r2-p2mp path 2-L3) of p2mp working path 2, branch node L1

   and branch node L3 will separately send control Packet of switch
   requirement to root node r1 and root node r2 through return path or
   control channel. when root node r1 and r2 received the packet from
   branch node L1 and L3 and processed it. and the control packet of
   switch requirement will be notified to the root node P of protection
   path .  The root node P received the notify packet and processed it.
   As the priority of p2mp working path 1 is higher than p2mp working
   path 2. so the root node P of protection path will select p2mp
   working path 1 to be protected, and send state control packet include
   path ID TLV to all branch nodes(L1,L2,L3,L4). when all branch
   nodes(L1,L2,L3,L4) received and processed the state control packet,
   As branch nodes(L1,L2,L3) is the branch nodes of p2mp working path 1,
   then they will be ready to receive and process the service packet
   from p2mp shared protection path. but branch node L4 is not the
   branch node of p2mp working path 1. then it will not be ready to
   receive and process the service packet from the p2mp protection path.
   and the root node r2 will continue to send their own service packets
   in p2mp working path 2. while the root node r1 will stop to send
   service packet in formerly p2mp working path 1.

   if the 1:n protection mechanism is revertive mode. when the failure
   is clear in p2mp working path 1. the root node r1 will restore back
   to p2mp working path 1 to transport P2MP service packet. or else, the
   root node r1 will not do this.

3.2.  (1:1)^n protection

   This protection solution can use p2p protection tunnel to protect
   branch path of many p2mp working paths which have the same branch
   node .  Under normal state, The root node of each p2mp working path
   will send p2mp service packet to its own all branch nodes by p2mp
   working path .in order to protect each branch path of the p2mp
   working path, A protection p2p LSP tunnel will be set up between
   source protection node and each branch node of all P2MP working path
   which will be protected by the P2P protection tunnel by staic
   configuration or dynamically configuration .and using only unique
   identifier value include IP multicast address,PW label etc can
   identify which p2mp service is tranported by protection P2P tunnel.
   when some branch nodes can't receive the failure detection packet
   from the root node of p2mp wroking path in a fixed time, it would
   generate failure notify packet and send it to the root node of p2mp
   working path and source protection node by return path or control
   channel. when the root node of p2mp working path received the failure
   notfiy packet from its own branch nodes, it will continue to send
   p2mp service packet in the p2mp working path. if it is necessary , it
   should duplicate p2mp service packet and send to source protection
   node. at the same time. while the source protection node received the
   failure notify packet, it will encapsulate the p2mp service packet

   from client node or the root node of p2mp working path by a unique
   identifier value, then further be encapsulated into p2p protection
   tunnel to send the service packet to the branch node of failure
   branch path. when branch path of another p2mp working path has the
   failure in the same branch node at the same time, if the p2mp service
   packet has more priority than the former p2mp service. the former
   p2mp service will be stopped to be protected and the later p2mp
   service will be carried by the same p2p protection LSP to the branch
   node . it can implement to share the protection resource of P2P
   protection tunnel; and its max bandwidth resource is equal to max
   value of bandwidth resource of all protected p2mp services.

   the implement in detail as the following figure :

   there are two P2MP working path : P2MP working path LSP 1(R1-P2MP
   Path 1-L1,L2) and P2MP working path LSP 2(R2-P2MP Path 2-L2,L3,L4).in
   addtion,in order to protecting service when the failure happened in
   the P2MP working path, a P2P protection tunnel will be pre-configured
   between each branch node(L1,L2,L3,L4) and source protection node(P).
   and the source protection node(P) may be another p2mp service's root

   the branch node L2,The P2MP service packet from client node or the
   root node(R1,R2) of P2MP working path LSP 1 and LSP 2 will be
   encapsulated by two different unique identifier(IP Multicast address,
   pw label etc) and be trasnported through P2P protection tunnel(P-L2).
   The branch node L2 will select the protection path to receive service
   packet. and basis on the unique identifier to judge which p2mp
   service the service packet to be transported by P2P protection tunnel
   is , so that the branch node L2 can process the service packet right.

   when the failure is clear , the branch node L2 will stop to send
   failure notify packet to root node(R1,R2_and source protection
   node_P. and select working path to receive service packet. when the
   source protection node(P) have not received the failure notify packet
   for a fixed time. it would stop to transport service by P2P
   protection tunnel.

3.3.   Conclusion

   The two kinds of p2mp protection solution will individually implement
   1:n and (1:1)^n protection for P2MP service. and fulfil the
   requirement of unidirectional p2mp protection and sharing protection
   resource. but there maybe a few questions for the two protection
   solutions.  We hope other experts provide some comments about the two
   protection solutions for p2mp service.




4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the authentication TLV need further
   study.


5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
