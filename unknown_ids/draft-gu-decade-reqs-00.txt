   protocol that is used by a P2P application client to control its
   shared resource in the in-network storage, as well as store/retrieve

1.  Introduction

   This document itemizes requirements for the following components.

      1 The overall requirements

      2 Access of In-network storage

      3 Control of In-network storage

      4 other relevant requirements

   This document will be updated align with problem statement.


2.  Terminologies and concepts

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses terms defined in [draft-song-decade-problem-
   statement].


3.  DECADE requirements

3.1.  The general requirements

      Req. DRv00-01: A In-network storage Access protocol (IAP) MUST be
      developed to support data read and write from DECADE client to In-
      network storage.

      Req. DRv00-02: The In-network storage Access protocol (IAP) MAY
      also . support data read and write between In-network storages.

      Req. DRv00-03: The In-network storage Access protocol (IAP) SHOULD
      be based on an end-to-end principle.  In other words, it is mainly
      the users' decisions on how to manage their shares of resources.

      Req. DRv00-04: In-network storage Access protocol SHOULD also
      provide resource control mechanism to support resource control
      from DECADE client to In-network storage.

3.2.  In-network Storage Access Protocol

3.2.1.  In-network Storage Access

      Req. DRv00-05: DECADE client MUST be able to initiate a session
      with the in-network storage using In-network storage Access
      Protocol (IAP).

      Req. DRv00-06: In-network storage MUST implement In-network
      storage Access Protocol (IAP) for receiving messages including
      content Storage, delete and request, and for sending corresponding
      response.

      Req. DRv00-07: Client which wants to use DECADE in-network storage
      MUST implement in-network storage Access protocol for sending
      message including content storage, delete and request, and for
      receiving corresponding response.

      Req. DRv00-08: In-network storage SHOULD support concurrent
      transfer, e.g. the in-network storage uploads to /downloads from
      multiple in-network storages or DECADE clients.

      Req. DRv00-9: IAP SHOULD enable clients to make decision on
      whether to download content directly to itself or to its in-
      network storage, or first to its in-network storage then to
      itself.

3.2.2.  Authorization

      Req. DRv00-10: DECADE Client SHOULD be able to authorize
      individual peers to retrieve the content stored on its In-network
      storage.

      Req. DRv00-11: In-network storage MUST check the authorization of
      a client before it stores or retrieves content.

3.2.3.  Management and Resource Control

      Req. DRv00-12: DECADE client SHOULD be able to retrieve current
      resource usage and quota on its in-network storage.

      Req. DRv00-13: DECADE client is RECOMMENDED to assign priority,
      bandwidth and connections quota to peers accessing the content in
      its In-network storage.

      Req. DRv00-14: DECADE client is RECOMMENDED to assign priority,
      bandwidth, connections and storage quota to peers storing content
      in its In-network storage.

Internet-Draft                 Decade reqs                  October 2009


      Req. DRv00-15: DECADE Server MAY support a time to live value for
      each content.

      Req. DRv00-16: Client MUST be able to delete the content stored on
      its In-network storage when it no longer wants the content to be
      distributed.  However, it's up to Client whether to delete the
      content or to leave it alone until the content is expired.

3.2.4.  Error handling and overload protection

      Req. DRv00-17: Any application designed to use DECADE SHOULD also
      work reasonably if no In-network storage can be found or if In-
      network storage reject the requests, e.g., due to connectivity
      problems or overload situation.

      Req. DRv00-18: In-network storage, which is operating close to its
      capacity limit, MUST be able to inform its client about its
      impending overload situation, and reject subsequent requests.

      Req. DRv00-19: In-network storage, which is operating close to its
      capacity limit, and is not able to provide DECADE service for the
      content that is already stored on it, MUST be able to inform the
      corresponding DECADE client about its impending overload
      situation.

3.2.5.  Transport requirements

      Req. DRv00-20: Data Transmission between Decade client and in-
      network storage, or between In-network storages MUST satisfy
      distinguished transmission requirements of various applications,
      e.g. streaming, file-sharing, web browsing, etc..


4.  Security Considerations

   In-network storage can be a victim of Denial of service (DoS), so
   that access control and resource control should be considered.  In-
   network storage can also be a complicity of content stealing if there
   is no authorization and authentication.

   There should be a mechanism to guarantee a safe transmission of
   authorization messages.


5.  Discussion

   Sometimes, several logical in-network storages could be deployed on
   same physical network device.  In this case, In-network storages on

   the same physical network device can communicate and transfer data
   through internal communication messages.  However in-network storages
   deployed on different physical network devices should communicate
   with In-network storage Access Protocol (IAP).

   To guarantee fairness among clients, In-network storage should assign
   storage/ bandwidth/connection quota for users.  Or else a few clients
   might occupy large amount of resource on the in-network storage,
   while others starved.
