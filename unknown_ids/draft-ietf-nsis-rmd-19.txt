       RMD-QOSM - The Resource Management in Diffserv QOS Model
                   <draft-ietf-nsis-rmd-19.txt>

Abstract

   This document describes an NSIS QoS Model for networks that use the 
   Resource Management in Diffserv (RMD) concept.  RMD is a technique 
   for adding admission control and pre-emption function to 
   Differentiated Services (Diffserv) networks.  The RMD QoS Model 
   allows devices external to the RMD network to signal reservation 
   requests to edge nodes in the RMD network. The RMD Ingress edge nodes
   classify the incoming flows into traffic classes and signals resource
   requests for the corresponding traffic class along the data path to 
   the Egress edge nodes for each flow.  Egress nodes reconstitute the 
   original requests and continue forwarding them along the data path 
   towards the final destination. In addition, RMD defines notification 
   functions to indicate overload situations within the domain to the 
   edge nodes.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a Next Steps In Signaling (NSIS) QoS model 
   for networks that use the Resource Management in Diffserv (RMD) 
   framework ([RMD1], [RMD2], [RMD3], [RMD4]). RMD adds admission 
   control to Diffserv networks and allows nodes external to the 
   networks to dynamically reserve resources within the Diffserv 
   domains. 
   
   The Quality of Service NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (QoS-NSLP) 
   [QoS-NSLP] specifies a generic protocol for carrying Quality of 
   Service(QoS) signaling information end-to-end in an IP network.  
   Each network along the end-to-end path is expected to implement a 
   specific QoS Model (QOSM) specified by the QSpec template [QSP-T] 
   that interprets the requests and installs the necessary mechanisms, 
   in a manner that is appropriate to the technology in use in the 
   network, to ensure the delivery of the requested QoS.
   This document specifies an NSIS QoS Model for RMD networks (RMD-
   QOSM), and an RMD-specific QSpec (RMD-QSPec) for expressing 
   reservations in a suitable form for simple processing by internal 
   nodes.

   They are used in combination with the QoS-NSLP to provide 
   QoS signaling service in an RMD network.  Figure 1 shows an RMD 
   network with the respective entities.

   Figure 1: Actors in the RMD-QOSM

   Many network scenarios, such as the "Wired Part of Wireless Network" 
   scenario, which is described in section 8.4 of [RFC3726] require that 
   the impact of the used QoS signaling protocol on the network 
   performance should be minimised. In such network scenarios, the 
   performance of each network node that is used in a communication path 
   has an impact on the end-to-end performance. As such, the end-to-end 
   performance of the communication path can be improved by optimizing 
   the performance of the interior nodes. One of the factors that can 
   contribute to this optimization is the minimization of the QoS 
   signalling protocol processing load and the minimization of the 
   number of states on each interior node.
   Another requirement that is imposed by such network scenarios is that 
   whenever a severe congestion situation occurs in the network, the 
   used QoS signaling protocol shoud be able to solve them. In case of a 
   route change or link failure a severe congestion situation may occur 
   in the network. Typically, routing algorithms are able to adapt and 
   change their routing decisions to reflect changes in the topology and 
   traffic volume. In such situations the re-routed traffic will have to 
   follow a new path. Interior nodes located on this new path may become 
   overloaded, since they suddenly might need to support more traffic 
   than they have capacity for. These severe congestion situations will 
   severely affect the overall performance of the traffic passing 
   through such nodes.

   RMD-QoSM is an edge-to-edge (intra-domain) QoS Model that in 
   combination with the QoS-NSLP and QSPEC specifications is designed to 
   support the requirements mentioned above:

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


      o Minimal Impact on Interior Node Performance;
      o Increase of scalability;
      o Ability to deal with severe congestion

   Internally to the RMD network, RMD-QOSM together with QoS-NSLP 
   [QoS-NSLP] defines a scalable QoS signaling model in which per-flow 
   QoS-NSLP and NTLP states are not stored in Interior nodes but 
   per-flow signaling is performed (see [QoS-NSLP]) at the edges.
   
   In the RMD-QOSM, only routers at the edges of a Diffserv domain 
   (Ingress and Egress nodes) support the (QoS-NSLP) stateful 
   operation, see Section 4.7 of [QoS-NSLP]. Interior nodes support 
   either the(QoS-NSLP) stateless operation, or a reduced-state 
   operation with coarser granularity than the edge nodes.

   After the terminology in Section 2, we give an overview of RMD and 
   the RMD-QOSM in Section 3.  This document specifies several RMD-
   QOSM/QoS-NSLP signaling schemes. In particular, Section 3.2.3 
   identifies which combination of sections are used for the 
   specification of each RMD-QOSM/QoS-NSLP signaling scheme. In Section 
   4 we give a detailed description of the RMD-QOSM, including the role 
   of QNEs, the definition of the QSpec, mapping of QSpec generic 
   parameters onto RMD-QOSM parameters, state management in QNEs, and 
   operation and sequence of events. Section 5 discusses security 
   issues.
   

2.  Terminology
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology defined by GIST [GIST] and QoS-NSLP [QoS-NSLP] 
   applies to this draft.

   In addition, the following terms are used:

   NSIS domain: a NSIS signalling capable domain.

   RMD domain: a NSIS domain that is capable of supporting the RMD-QOSM
   signalling and operations.

   Edge node: a QoS-NSLP node on the boundary of some
   administrative domain that connects one NSIS domain to a node  
   either in another NSIS domain or in a non NSIS domain.

   NSIS aware node: a node that is aware of NSIS signalling and RMD- 
   QOSM operations, such as severe congestion detection and DSCP 
   marking.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   NSIS unaware: a node that is unware of NSIS signalling, but is 
   aware of RMD-QOSM operations such as severe congestion detection 
   and DSCP marking.

   Ingress node: An edge node in its role in handling the traffic 
   as it enters the NSIS domain.

   Egress node: An edge node in its role in handling the traffic  
   as it leaves the NSIS domain.
   Interior node: a node in a NSIS domain that is not an edge node. 

   Congestion: is a temporal network state that occurs when the traffic 
   (or when traffic associated with a particular PHB) passing through a 
   link is slightly higher than the capacity allocated for the link (or 
   allocated for the particular PHB). If no measures are taken than the 
   traffic passing through this link may temporarily slightly degrade in 
   QoS. This type of congestion is usually solved using admission 
   control mechanisms.

   Severe congestion: Is the congestion situation on a particular link 
   within the RMD domain where a significant increase in its real packet 
   queue situation occurs, such as when due to a link failure re-routed 
   traffic has to be supported by this particular link. 



3.  Overview of RMD and RMD-QOSM

3.1.  RMD
   
   The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture ([RFC2475], 
   [RFC2638]) was introduced as a result of efforts to avoid the 
   scalability and complexity problems of Intserv [RFC1633].  
   Scalability is achieved by offering services on an aggregate 
   rather than per-flow basis and by forcing as much of the per-flow 
   state as possible to the edges of the network.  The service 
   differentiation is achieved using the Differentiated Services (DS) 
   field in the IP header and the Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) as the main 
   building blocks.  Packets are handled at each node according to the
   PHB indicated by the DS field in the message header.
   
   The Diffserv architecture does not specify any means for devices 
   outside the domain to dynamically reserve resources or receive 
   indications of network resource availability.  In practice, service
   providers rely on short active time Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
   that statically define the parameters of the traffic that will be 
   accepted from a customer.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   RMD was introduced as a method for dynamic reservation of resources 
   within a Diffserv domain.  It describes a method that is able to 
   provide admission control for flows entering the domain and a 
   congestion handling algorithm that is able to terminate flows in 
   case of congestion due to a sudden failure (e.g., link, router) 
   within the domain. 
   
   In RMD, scalability is achieved by separating a fine-grained 
   reservation mechanism used in the edge nodes of a Diffserv domain 
   from a much simpler reservation mechanism needed in the Interior 
   nodes.  Typically it is assumed that edge nodes support per-
   flow QoS states in order to provide QoS guarantees for each flow. 
   Interior nodes use only one aggregated reservation state per traffic
   class or no states at all.  In this way it is possible to handle 
   large numbers of flows in the Interior nodes. Furthermore, due to 
   the limited functionality supported by the Interior nodes, this 
   solution allows fast processing of signaling messages. 
   
   The possible RMD-QOSM applicabilities are described in Section 
   3.2.3. Two main basic admission control modes are supported: 
   reservation-based and measurement-based admission control that can 
   be used in combination with a severe congestion handling solution. 
   The severe congestion handling solution is used in the situation 
   that a link/node becomes severely congested due to the fact that the 
   traffic supported by a failed link/node is rerouted and has to be 
   processed by this link/node. Furthermore, RMD-QOSM supports both 
   uni-directional and bi-directional reservations.

   Another important feature of RMD-QOSM is that the intra-domain
   sessions supported by the edges can be either per flow sessions or 
   per aggregate sessions. In case of the per flow intra-domain 
   sessions, the maintained per flow intra-domain states have a one-to-
   one dependency to the per flow end-to-end states supported by the 
   same edge. In case of the per-aggregate sessions the maintained per-
   aggregate states have a one-to-many relationship to the per flow 
   end-to-end states supported by the same edge.

   In the reservation-based method, each Interior node maintains 
   only one reservation state per traffic class.  The Ingress edge 
   nodes aggregate individual flow requests into PHB traffic classes, 
   and signal changes in the class reservations as necessary.  The 
   reservation is quantified in terms of resource units (or bandwidth).  
   These resources are requested dynamically per PHB and reserved on 
   demand in all nodes in the communication path from an Ingress node 
   to an Egress node.

   The measurement-based algorithm continuously measures traffic levels 
   and the actual available resources, and admits flows whose resource 
   needs are within what is available at the time of the request. The 
   measurement based algorithm is used to support a predictive service 
   where the service commitment is somewhat less reliable than the 
   service that can be supported by the reservation based method.

Bader, et al.                                                  [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   A main assumption that is taken by such measurement based admission 
   control mechanisms is that the aggregated PHB traffic passing through 
   an RMD interior node is high and therefore, current measurement 
   characteristics are considered to be an indicator of future load.
   Once an admission decision is made, no record of the decision need be 
   kept at the interior nodes.  The advantage of measurement-based 
   resource management protocols is that they do not require pre-
   reservation state nor explicit release of the reservations at the 
   interior nodes. Moreover, when the user traffic is variable, 
   measurement based admission control could provide higher network 
   utilization than, e.g., peak-rate reservation.  However, this can 
   introduce an uncertainty in the availability of the resources.
   It is important to emphasize that the RMD measurement based schemes 
   described in this document do not use any refresh procedures, since 
   these approaches are used in stateless nodes, see Section 4.6.1.3.

   Two types of measurement based admission control schemes are 
   possible:

   * Congestion notification function based on probing: 

   This method can be used to implement a simple measurement-based 
   admission control within a Diffserv domain. In this scenario the 
   interior nodes are not NSIS aware nodes. In these interior nodes 
   thresholds are set for the traffic belonging to different PHBs in 
   the measurement based admission control function. In this scenario 
   an end-to-end NSIS message is used as a probe packet, meaning that 
   the DSCP field in the header of the IP packet that carries the NSIS 
   message is re-marked when the predefined congestion threshold is 
   exceeded. Note that when the predefined congestion threshold is 
   exceeded all packets are remarked by a node, including NSIS 
   messages. In this way the edges can admit or reject flows that are 
   requesting resources. The frequency and durations that the congestion 
   level is above the threshold resulting in remarking, is tracked and 
   used to influence the admission control decisions. 

   * NSIS measurement-based admission control: 

   In this case the measurement-based admission control functionality 
   is implemented in NSIS aware stateless routers. The main difference 
   between this type of admission control and the congestion 
   notification based on probing is related to the fact that this type 
   of admission control is applied mainly on NSIS aware nodes.
   With the measurement based scheme the requested peak bandwidth of a 
   flow is carried by the admission control request. The admission 
   decision is considered as positive if the currently carried traffic, 
   as characterized by the measured statistics, plus the requested 
   resources for the new flow exceeds the system capacity with a 
   probability smaller than a value alpha. Otherwise, the admission 
   decision is negative. It is important to emphasize that due to the 
   fact that the RMD interior nodes are stateless, they do not store 
   information of previous admission control requests. 


Bader, et al.                                                  [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   This could lead to a situation where the admission control accuracy 
   is decreased when multiple simultaneous flows (sharing a common 
   interior node) are requesting admission control simultaneously. By 
   applying measuring techniques, see e.g., [JaSh97], [GrTs03], which 
   are using current and past information on NSIS sessions that 
   requested resources from an NSIS aware interior node, the decrease in 
   admission control accuracy can be limited.
   RMD describes the following procedures:

   * Classification of an individual resource reservation or a resource 
     query into Per Hop Behavior (PHB) groups at the Ingress node of 
     the domain, 

   * Hop-by-hop admission control based on a PHB within the 
     domain. There are two possible modes of operation for internal 
     nodes to admit requests. One mode is the stateless or 
     measurement-based mode, where the resources within the domain are 
     queried. Another mode of operation is the reduced-state 
     reservation or reservation based mode, where the resources within 
     the domain are reserved.

   * a method to forward the original requests across the domain up to 
     the Egress node and beyond.

   * a congestion control algorithm that notifies the egress edge nodes 
     about congestion. It is able to terminate the appropriate number 
     of flows in case a of congestion due to a sudden failure (e.g., 
     link or router failure) within the domain.


3.2. Basic features of RMD-QOSM

3.2.1 Role of the QNEs

   The protocol model of the RMD-QOSM is shown in Figure 2.  The figure
   shows QNI and QNR nodes, not part of the RMD network, that are the 
   ultimate initiator and receiver of the QoS reservation requests.  It
   also shows QNE nodes that are the Ingress and Egress nodes in the 
   RMD domain (QNE Ingress and QNE Egress), and QNE nodes that are 
   Interior nodes (QNE Interior).
   
   All nodes of the RMD domain are usually QoS-NSLP aware nodes. 
   However, in the scenarios where the congestion notification function 
   based on probing is used, then the interior nodes are not NSIS 
   aware.  Edge nodes store and maintain QoS-NSLP and NTLP states and 
   therefore are stateful nodes.  The NSIS aware Interior nodes are 
   NTLP stateless. Furthermore they are either QoS-NSLP stateless (for 
   NSIS measurement-based operation), or are reduced state nodes 
   storing per PHB aggregated QoS-NSLP states (for reservation-based 
   operation).

   Note that the RMD domain MAY contain Interior nodes that are 
   not NSIS aware nodes (not shown in the figure).  

Bader, et al.                                                  [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   These nodes are assumed to have sufficient capacity for flows that 
   might be admitted.  Furthermore, some of these NSIS unaware nodes MAY 
   be used for measuring the traffic congestion level on the data path. 
   These measurements can be used by RMD-QOSM in the congestion control 
   based on probing operation and/or severe congestion operation 
   (see Section 4.6.1.6).

3.2.2 RMD-QOSM/QoS-NSLP Signaling

   The basic RMD-QOSM/QoS-NSLP signaling is shown in Figure 3. The 
   signalling scenarios are accomplished using the QoS-NSLP processing 
   rules defined in [QoS-NSLP], in combination with the RMF triggers 
   sent via the QoS-NSLP-RMF API described in [QoS-NSLP]. 
   Due to the fact that within the RMD domain a different QoS model can 
   be supported than the end-to-end QoS model applied at the edges of 
   the RMD domain, the RMD interior node reduced state reservations can 
   be updated independently of the per-flow end-to-end reservations, see 
   Section 4.7 of [QoS-NSLP]. Therefore, two different RESERVE messages 
   are used within the RMD domain. One RESERVE message that is 
   associated with the per flow end-to-end reservations and is used by 
   the edges of the RMD domain and one that is associated with the 
   reduced state reservations within the RMD domain.
 
   A RESERVE message is created by a QNI with an Initiator QSpec 
   describing the reservation and forwarded along the path towards the 
   QNR.  

Bader, et al.                                                  [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   When the original RESERVE message arrives at the Ingress node, 
   an RMD-QSpec is constructed based on the initial QSpec in the message 
   (usually the Initiator QSpec).  The RMD-QSpec is sent in a intra-
   domain, independent RESERVE message through the Interior nodes 
   towards the QNR. This intra-domain RESERVE message uses the  GIST 
   datagram signaling mechanism. Note that the RMD-QOSM cannot directly 
   specify that the GIST datagram mode SHOULD be used. This can however 
   be notified by using the GIST API Transfer-Attributes, such as 
   unreliable, low level of security and use of local policy. 
   Meanwhile, the original RESERVE message is sent to the Egress node 
   on the path to the QNR using the reliable transport mode of NTLP. 
   Each QoS-NSLP node on the data path processes the intra-domain
   RESERVE message and checks the availability of resources with either 
   the reservation-based or the measurement-based method.

   Figure 3: Sender-initiated reservation with Reduced State Interior
             Nodes

   When the message reaches the Egress node, and the reservation is 
   successful in each Interior node, an intra-domain (local) RESPONSE` 
   is sent towards the ingress node and the original (end-to-end) 
   RESERVE message is forwarded to the next domain.  When the Egress 
   node receives a RESPONSE message from the downstream end, it is 
   forwarded directly to the Ingress node.
   If an intermediate node cannot accommodate the new request, it 
   indicates this by marking a single bit in the message, and continues
   forwarding the message until the Egress node is reached. From the 
   Egress node an intra-domain RESPONSE` and an original RESPONSE 
   message are sent directly to the Ingress node. 

  Bader, et al.                                                [Page 11]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   As a consequence in the stateless/reduced state domain only sender-
   initiated reservation can be performed and functions requiring per 
   flow NTLP or QoS-NSLP states, like summary and reduced refreshes, 
   cannot be used. If per flow identification, is needed, i.e., 
   associating the flow IDs for the reserved resources, Edge nodes act 
   on behalf of Interior nodes.


3.2.3 RMD-QOSM Applicability and considerations

   The RMD-QOSM is a Diffserv-based bandwidth management methodology 
   that is not able to provide a full Diffserv support. 
   The reason of this is that the RMD-QOSM concept can only support the 
   (Expedited Forwarding) EF-like functionality behavior, but is not 
   able to support the full set of (Assured Forwarding) AF-like 
   functionality. The bandwidth information REQUIRED by the EF-like 
   functionality behaviour can be supported by RMD-QOSM carrying the 
   bandwidth information in the <QoS Desired> parameter, see [QSP-T]. 
   The full set of (Assured Forwarding) AF-like functionality requires 
   information that is specified in two token buckets. The RMD-QOSM is 
   not supporting the use of two token buckets and therefore, it is not 
   able to support the full set of AF-functionality. Note however, 
   that RMD-QOSM could also support a single AF PHB, when the traffic 
   or the upper limit of the traffic can be characterized by a single 
   bandwidth parameter. Moreover, it is considered that in case of 
   tunnelling, the RMD-QOSM supports only the uniform tunnelling mode 
   for Differentiated services, see [RFC2983]. 

   The RMD domain MUST be engineered in such a way that each QNE Ingress 
   maintains information about the smallest MTU that is supported on the 
   links within the RMD domain.

   A very important consideration on using RMD-QOSM is that within one 
   RMD domain only one of the following RMD-QOSM schemes can be used at 
   a time. Thus a RMD router can never process and use two different 
   RMD-QOSM signaling schemes at the same time. 

   However, all RMD QNEs supporting this specification MUST support the 
   combination the "per flow RMD reservation based" in combination with 
   "severe congestion handling by proportional data packet marking" 
   scheme. If the RMD QNEs support more RMD-QOSM schemes then the 
   operator of that RMD domain MUST pre-configure all the QNE edge nodes 
   within one domain such that the <SCH> field included in the "PHR 
   container", see Section 4.1.2 and the "PDR Container", see Section 
   4.1.3, will use always the same value, such that within one RMD 
   domain only one of the below described RMD-QOSM schemes is used at a 
   time.

   The congestion situations, see Section 2, are solved using admission 
   control mechanism, e.g., "per flow congestion notification based on 
   probing", while the severe congestion situations, see Section 2, are 
   solved using the severe congestion handling mechanisms, e.g., "Severe 
   congestion handling by proportional data packet marking".

Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 12]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   The RMD domain MUST be engineered in such a way that RMD-QOSM 
   messages could be transported using the GIST Query and 
   Data messages in Q-mode, see [GIST]. This means that the Path MTU 
   MUST be engineered in such a way that the RMD-QOSM message are 
   transported without fragmentation. Furthermore, the RMD domain MUST 
   be engineered in such a way to guarantee capacity for the GIST 
   Query and Data messages in Q-mode, within the rate control limits 
   imposed by GIST, see [GIST].

   The RMD domain has to be configured such that the GIST context-free 
   flag (C-flag) MUST be set (C=1) for Query messages and Data 
   messages sent in Q-mode, see [GIST].

   It is important to note that the concepts described in Sections 
   4.6.1.6.2, 4.6.2.5.2, 4.6.1.6.2 and 4.6.2.5.2 contributed to 
   the PCN WG standardisation.

   The available RMD-QOSM/QoS-NSLP signaling schemes are:

   * "per flow congestion notification based on probing" (see 
     Sections 4.3.2, 4.6.1.7., 4.6.2.6.). Note that this scheme uses for 
     severe congestion handling the "Severe congestion handling by 
     proportional data packet marking", see Section 4.6.1.6.2, 
     4.6.2.5.2). Furthermore, the interior nodes are considered to be 
     Diffserv aware, but NSIS unaware nodes, see Section 4.3.2.

   * "per flow RMD NSIS measurement based admission control" (see 
     Sections 4.3.2, 4.6.1, 4.6.2). Note that this scheme uses for  
     severe congestion handling the "Severe congestion handling by 
     proportional data packet marking", see Section 4.6.1.6.2, 
     4.6.2.5.2). Furthermore, the interior nodes are considered to be 
     NSIS aware nodes, see Section 4.3.2.

   * "per flow RMD reservation based" in combination with "severe 
     congestion handling by the RMD-QOSM refresh procedure" (see 
     Sections 4.3.3, 4.6.1, 4.6.1.6.1, 4.6.2.5.1). Note that this 
     scheme uses for severe congestion handling the "Severe congestion 
     handling by the RMD-QOSM refresh" procedure, see Section 4.6.1.6.1,
     4.6.2.5.1). Furthermore, the intra-domain sessions supported by the
     edge nodes are per flow sessions, see Section 4.3.3.

   * "per flow RMD reservation based" in combination with "severe 
     congestion handling by proportional data packet marking" procedure 
     (see Sections 4.3.3, 4.6.1, 4.6.1.6.2, 4.6.2.5.2). Note that 
     this scheme uses for severe congestion handling the "Severe 
     congestion handling by proportional data packet marking" procedure,
     see Section 4.6.1.6.2, 4.6.2.5.2). Furthermore, the intra-domain 
     sessions supported by the edge nodes are per flow sessions, see 
     Section 4.3.3.

     scheme uses for severe congestion handling the "Severe congestion 
     handling by the RMD-QOSM refresh" procedure, see Section 4.6.1.6.1,
     4.6.2.5.1). Furthermore, the intra-domain sessions supported by the
     edge nodes are per aggregate sessions, see Section 4.3.1. Moreover, 
     this scheme can be considered to be a reservation-based scheme, 
     since the RMD interior nodes are reduced-state nodes, i.e., they do 
     not store NTLP/GIST states but they do store per PHB-aggregated 
     QoS-NSLP reservation states.

4.  RMD-QOSM, Detailed Description
   
   This section describes the RMD-QOSM in more detail.  In particular, 
   it defines the role of stateless and reduced-state QNEs, the 
   RMD-QOSM QSpec Object, the format of the RMD-QOSM QoS-NSLP messages 
   and how QSpecs are processed and used in different protocol 
   operations.  


4.1.  RMD-QSpec Definition
   
   The RMD-QOSM uses the QSpec format specified in [QSP-T].
   The Initiator/Local QSPEC bit, i.e., <I> is set to "Local" (i.e., 
   "1") and the <Qspec Proc> is set as follows:
   * Message Sequence = 0: Sender initiated
   * Object combination = 0: <QoS Desired> for RESERVE and 
     <QoS Reserved> for RESPONSE

   The <QSPEC Version> used by RMD-QOSM is the default version, i.e.,    
   "0", see [QSP-T]. The <QSPEC Type> value used by the RMD-QOSM is 
   specified in [QSP-T] and is equal to: "2".
   The <Traffic Handling Directives> contains the following fields:

   <Traffic Handling Directives> = <PHR container> <PDR container>



Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 14]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   The Per Hop Reservation container (PHR container) and 
   the Per Domain Reservation container (PDR container) are specified 
   in Section 4.1.2 and 4.1.3, respectively. The <PHR container> 
   contains the traffic handling directives for intra-domain 
   communication and reservation.  The <PDR container> contains 
   additional traffic handling directives that is needed for 
   edge-to-edge communication. The parameter IDs used by the <PHR 
   container> and <PDR container> are assigned by IANA, see Section 6. 

   The RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired> and <QoS Reserved>, are specified in 
   Section 4.1.1. The RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired> and <QoS Reserved> and the 
   <PHR container> are used and processed by the Edge and Interior 
   nodes. The <PDR container> field is only processed by Edge nodes.  


4.1.1.  RMD-QOSM QoS Desired and QoS Reserved
   
   The RESERVE message contains only the QoS Desired object [QSP-T]. The 
   QoS Reserved object is carried by the RESPONSE message.

   In RMD-QOSM the <QoS Desired> and <QoS Reserved> objects contain the 
   following parameters: 

   <QoS Desired> = <TMOD-1> <PHB Class> <Admission Priority>
   <QoS Reserved> = <TMOD-1> <PHB Class> <Admission Priority>

   The bit format of the <PHB Class> (see [QSP-T] and Figure 4 and  
   Figure 5) and <Admission Priority> complies to the bit format 
   specified in [QSP-T]. 

   Note that for the RMD-QOSM a reservation established without an 
   <Admission Priority> parameter is equivalent to a reservation 
   established with an <Admission Priority> whose value is 1.

      Figure 6: PHR container

   Container ID: 12 bit field, indicating the PHR type:
   PHR_Resource_Request, PHR_Release_Request, PHR_Refresh_Update.
   
   "PHR_Resource_Request" (Container ID = 17): initiate or update 
   the traffic class reservation state on all nodes located on the 
   communication path between the QNE(Ingress) and QNE(Egress) nodes.

   "PHR_Release_Request" (Container ID = 18): explicitly release, by 
   subtraction, the reserved resources for a particular flow
   from a traffic class reservation state.   

   "PHR_Refresh_Update" (Container ID = 19): refresh the 
   traffic class reservation soft state on all nodes located on the 
   communication path between the QNE(Ingress) and QNE(Egress) 
   nodes according to a resource reservation request that was 
   successfully processed during a previous refresh period.
   

   <S> (Severe Congestion):
   1 bit.  In case of a route change refreshing RESERVE messages 
   follow the new data path, and hence resources are requested 
   there.  If the resources are not sufficient to accommodate the new 
   traffic severe congestion occurs.  Severe congested Interior nodes 
   SHOULD notify Edge QNEs about the congestion by setting the S bit.

   <O> (Overload): 
   1 bit. This field is used during the severe congestion handling 
   scheme that is using the RMD-QOSM refresh procedure. This bit is set 
   when an overload on a QNE interior node  is detected and when this 
   field is carried by the "PHR_Refresh_Update" container. <O>
   SHOULD be set to"1" if the <S> bit is set. For more details see 
   Section 4.6.1.6.1. 

   <M>:
   1 bit.  In case of unsuccessful resource reservation or resource 
   query in an Interior QNE, this QNE sets the M bit in order to 
   notify the Egress QNE.  
   
   <Admitted Hops>:
   8 bit field.  The <Admitted Hops> counts the number of hops in the 
   RMD domain where the reservation was successful.  The <Admitted 
   Hops> is set to "0" when a RESERVE message enters a domain and it 
   MUST be incremented by each Interior QNE, provided that the Hop_U bit 
   is not set.  However when a QNE that does 
   not have sufficient resources to admit the reservation is reached, 
   the M Bit is set, and the <Admitted Hops> value is frozen, by setting
   the Hop_U bit to "1". Note that the <Admitted Hops> parameter in 
   combinations with the <Max Admitted Hops> and <K> parameters are used 
   during the RMD partial release procedures, see Section 4.6.1.5.2.
   
   <Hop_U> (NSLP_Hops unset): 
   1-bit. The QNE(Ingress) node MUST set the <Hop_U> parameter to 
   0.  This parameter SHOULD be set to "1" by a node when the node does
   not increase the <Admitted Hops> value. This is the case when an 
   RMD-QOSM reservation-based node is not admitting the reservation 
   request. When <Hop_U> is set "1" the <Admitted Hops> SHOULD NOT be 
   changed. Note that this flag in combination with the <Admitted Hops> 
   flag are used to locate the last node that successfully processed a 
   reservation request, see Section 4.6.1.2. 
   

   <B>: 1 bit.  When set to "1" it indicates bi-directional reservation.

   <Time Lag>: It represents the ratio between the "T_Lag" parameter, 
   which is the time difference between the departure time of
   the last sent "PHR_Refresh_Update" control information container and 
   the departure time of the "PHR_Release_Request" control information 
   container,and the length of the refresh period, "T_period", see 
   Section 4.6.1.5.

   
   <K>: 1 bit. When set to "1" it indicates that the resources/bandwidth  
   carried by a tearing RESERVE MUST NOT be released and the 
   resources/bandwidth carried by a non tearing RESERVE MUST NOT be 
   reserved/refreshed. For more details see Section 4.6.1.5.2.

   <Max Admitted Hops>: 
   8-bit.  The <Admitted Hops> value that has been carried by the 
   PHR container field used to identify the RMD reservation based node 
   that admitted or process a "PHR_Resource_Request" 

   <SCH>: 3-bit.  The <SCH> value that is used to specify which of the 6 
   RMD-QOSM scenarios, see Section 3.2.3, MUST be used within the RMD 
   domain. The operator of an RMD domain MUST pre-configure all the QNE 
   edge nodes within one domain such that the <SCH> field included in 
   the "PHR container", will use always the same value, such that within 
   one RMD domain only one of the below described RMD-QOSM schemes can 
   be used at a time. All the QNE interior nodes MUST interpret this 
   field before processing any other PHR container payload fields. The 
   currently defined <SCH> values are:

   o  0:     RMD-QOSM scheme MUST be: "per flow congestion notification 
             based on probing";

   o  1:     RMD-QOSM scheme MUST be: "per flow RMD NSIS measurement 
             based admission control",

   o  2:     RMD-QOSM scheme MUST be: "per flow RMD reservation based" 
             in combination with "severe congestion handling by the RMD-
             QOSM refresh procedure";

   o  3 :    RMD-QOSM scheme MUST be: "per flow RMD reservation based" 
             in combination with "severe congestion handling by 
             proportional data packet marking" 

   o  4:     RMD-QOSM scheme MUST be: "per aggregate RMD reservation 
             based" in combination with  "severe congestion handling by 
             the RMD-QOSM refresh procedure" 

   o  5:     RMD-QOSM scheme MUST be: "per aggregate RMD reservation 
             based" in combination with "severe congestion handling by 
             proportional data packet marking"

   o  6 - 7: reserved

  The default value of the <SCH> field MUST be set to the value equal 
  to 3.

4.1.3.  PDR container
   
   This section describes the parameters of the PDR container, which are

   "PDR_Reservation_Request" traffic handling directive fields have been 
   received and that the request has been admitted or rejected
 
   "PDR_Refresh_Report" (Container ID = 24) generated and

   <S> (PDR Severe Congestion):
   1-bit.  Specifies if a severe congestion situation occurred.  
   It can also carry the <S> parameter of the 
   "PHR_Resource_Request" or "PHR_Refresh_Update" fields. 
   
   <O> (Overload): 
   1 bit. This field is used during the severe congestion handling 
   scheme that is using the RMD-QOSM refresh procedure. This bit is set 
   when an overload on a QNE interior node  is detected and when this 
   field is carried by the ""PDR_Congestion_Report" container. 
   <O> SHOULD be set to"1" if the <S> bit is set. For more details see 
   Section 4.6.1.6.1. 
   
   <M> (PDR Marked):
   1-bit.  Carries the <M> value of the "PHR_Resource_Request" or 
   "PHR_Refresh_Update" traffic handling directive fields. 

   <B>: 1 bit Indicates bi-directional reservation.

   <Max Admitted Hops>: 
   8-bit.  The <Admitted Hops> value that has been carried by the 
   PHR container field used to identify the RMD reservation based node 
   that admitted or process a "PHR_Resource_Request" 

   <PDR Bandwidth>:
   32 bits.  This field specifies the bandwidth that either applies 
   when the "B" flag is set to "1" and when this parameter is carried 
   by a RESPONSE message, or when a severe congestion occurs and the 
   QNE edges maintain an aggregated intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational 
   state and it is carried by a NOTIFY message.  In the situation that 
   the "B" flag is set to "1" this parameter specifies the requested 
   bandwidth that have to be reserved by a node in the reverse 
   direction and when the intra-domain signaling procedures require a 
   bi-directional reservation procedure.  In the severe congestion 
   situation this parameter specifies the bandwidth that has to be 
   released.

   <SCH>: 3-bit.  The <SCH> value that is used to specify which of the 6 
   RMD scenarios, see Section 3.2.3, MUST be used within the RMD domain. 
   The operator of an RMD domain MUST pre-configure all the QNE edge 
   nodes within one domain such that the <SCH> field included in the 
   "PDR container", will use always the same value, such that within one 
   RMD domain only one of the below described RMD-QOSM schemes can be 
   used at a time. All the QNE interior nodes MUST interpret this field 
   before processing any other "PDR container" payload fields. The 
   currently defined <SCH> values are:

             proportional data packet marking"

   o  6 - 7: reserved

  
   The default value of the <SCH> field MUST be set to the value equal 
   to 3.


4.2.  Message Format
   
   The format of the messages used by the RMD-QOSM complies with the 
   QoS-NSLP and QSpec template specifications.  The QSpec used by RMD-
   QOSM is denoted in this document as RMD-QSpec and is described in 
   Section 4.1. 

   
4.3.  RMD node state management
   
   The QoS-NSLP state creation and management is specified in 
   [QoS-NSLP].  This section describes the state creation and 
   management functions of the Resource Management Function (RMF) in 
   the RMD nodes.  


4.3.1 Aggregated operational and reservation states at the QNE Edges

   The QNE Edges maintain both the intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational 
   and reservation states, while the QNE Interior nodes maintain only 
   reservation states. The structure of the intra-domain QoS-NSLP 
   operational state used by the QNE edges is specified in [QoS-NSLP]. 

   In this case the intra-domain sessions supported by the edges are per  
   aggregate sessions that have a one-to-many relationship to the per 
   flow end-to-end states supported by the same edge. 




Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 21]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   Note that the method of selecting the end-to-end sessions that form 
   an aggregate is not specified in this document. An example how this 
   can be accomplished is by monitoring the GIST routing states used by 
   the end-to-end sessions and group the ones that use the same <PHB 
   class>, QNE Ingress and QNE Egress addresses and the value of the 
   priority level. Note that this priority level should be deduced from 
   the priority parameters carried by the initial QSpec object.

   The operational state of this aggregated intra-domain session MUST 
   contain a list with BOUND_SESSION_IDs. 

   The structure of the list depends on whether a unidirectional 
   reservation or a bidirectional reservation is supported.


   When the operational state (at QNE ingress and QNE egress) supports 
   unidirectional reservations then this state MUST contain a list with 
   BOUND_SESSION_IDs maintaining the SESSION_ID values of its bound 
   end-to-end sessions. The BINDING_CODE associated with this 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID is set to code (Aggregated sessions).  Thus the 
   operational state maintains a list of BOUND_SESSION_IDs entries. 
   Each entry is created when an end-to-end session joins the 
   aggregated intra-domain session and is removed when an end-to-end 
   session leaves the aggregate.

   It is important to emphasize that in this case, the operational 
   state (at QNE ingress and QNE egress) that is maintained by each 
   end-to-end session bound to the aggregated intra-domain session it 
   MUST contain in the BOUND_SESSION_ID, the SESSION_ID value of the 
   bound tunnelled intra-domain (aggregate) session. The BINDING_CODE 
   associated with this BOUND_SESSION_ID is set to code (Aggregated 
   sessions).

   When the operational state (at QNE ingress and QNE egress) supports 
   bidirectional reservations then the operational state MUST contain a 
   list of BOUND_SESSION_ID sets. Each set contain two 
   BOUND_SESSION_IDs.  One of the BOUND_SESSION_IDs maintains the 
   SESSION_ID value of one of bound end-to-end session. The 
   BINDING_CODE associated with this BOUND_SESSION_ID is set to code 
   (Aggregated sessions). Another BOUND_SESSION_ID, within the same set 
   entry, maintains the SESSION_ID of the bidirectional bound end-to-
   end session. The BINDING_CODE associated with this BOUND_SESSION_ID 
   is set to code (Bi-directional sessions).

   Note that in each set, a one to one relation exists between each 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID with BINDING_CODE set to (Aggregate sessions) and 
   each BOUND_SESSION_ID with BINDING_CODE set to (Bi-directional 
   sessions). Each set is created when an end-to-end session joins the 
   aggregated operational state and is removed when an end-to-end 
   session leaves the aggregated operational state.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   It is important to emphasize that in this case, the operational 
   state (at QNE ingress and QNE egress) that is maintained by each 
   end-to-end session bound to the aggregated intra-domain session it 
   MUST contain two types of BOUND_SESSION_IDs. One is the 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID that MUST contain the SESSION_ID value of the bound 
   tunelled aggregated intra-domain session that is using the 
   BINDING_CODE set to (Aggregated sessions). The other 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID maintains the SESSION_ID of the bound bidirectional 
   end-to-end session. The BINDING_CODE associated with this 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID is set to code (Bi-directional sessions).

   When the QNE Edges use aggregated QoS-NSLP reservation states, then  
   the PHB class value and the size of the aggregated 
   reservation, e.g., reserved bandwidth have to be maintained.
   Note that this type of aggregation is an edge to edge aggregation 
   and is similar to the aggregation type specified in [RFC3175].
   

   The size of the aggregated reservations needs to be 
   greater or equal to the sum of bandwidth of the inter domain 
   (end-to-end) reservations/sessions it aggregates, see e.g., Section 
   1.4.4 of [RFC3175]. 

   A policy can be used to maintain the amount of REQUIRED bandwidth on 
   a given aggregated reservation by taking into account the sum of the 
   underlying inter domain (end-to-end) reservations, while endeavouring 
   to change reservation less frequently.  This MAY require a trend 
   analysis. If there is a significant probability that in the next 
   interval of time the current aggregated reservation is exhausted, the 
   Ingress router MUST predict the necessary bandwidth and request it.  
   If the Ingress router has a significant amount of bandwidth reserved 
   but has very little probability of using it, the policy MAY predict 
   the amount of bandwidth REQUIRED and release the excess.  To increase 
   or decrease the aggregate, the RMD modification procedures SHOULD be 
   used (see Section 4.6.1.4). 

   The QNE interior node are reduced state nodes, i.e., they do not 
   store NTLP/GIST states but they do store per PHB-aggregated QoS-NSLP 
   reservation states. These reservation states are maintained and 
   refreshed in the same way as described in Section 4.3.3.


4.3.2  Measurement-based method

   The QNE Edges maintain per flow intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational 
   and reservation states that are containing similar data structures 
   as described in Section 4.3.1. The main difference is associated 
   with the different types of the used MRI and the bound end-to-end 
   sessions. The structure of the maintained BOUND_SESSION_IDs depends 
   on whether a unidirectional reservation or a bidirectional 
   reservation is supported.



Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 23]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   When unidirectional reservations are supported then the operational 
   state associated with this per flow intra-domain session MUST 
   contain in the BOUND_SESSION_ID the SESSION_ID value of its bound 
   end-to-end session. The BINDING_CODE associated with this 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID is set to code (Tunnelled and end-to-end sessions).

   When bidirectional reservations are supported then the operational 
   state (at QNE ingress and QNE egress) MUST contain two types of 
   BOUND_SESSION_IDs. One is the BOUND_SESSION_ID that maintains the 
   SESSION_ID value of the bound tunnelled per-flow intra-domain 
   session.  The BINDING_CODE associated with this BOUND_SESSION_ID is 
   set to code (Tunnelled and end-to-end sessions).
   The other BOUND_SESSION_ID maintains the SESSION_ID of the bound 
   bidirectional end-to-end session. The BINDING_CODE associated with 
   this BOUND_SESSION_ID is set to code (Bi-directional sessions).

   Furthermore, the QoS-NSLP reservation state maintains the PHB class 
   value, the value of the bandwidth requested by the end-to-end 
   session bound to the intra-domain session and the value of the 
   priority level. 


   The measurement-based method can be classified in two schemes:

   * Congestion notification based on probing:

   In this scheme the interior nodes are Diffserv aware but not NSIS 
   aware nodes. Each interior node counts the bandwidth that is used 
   by each PHB traffic class. This counter value is stored in an  
   RMD_QOSM state. For each PHB traffic class a predefined congestion 
   notification threshold is set. The predefined congestion 
   notification threshold is set according to, an engineered bandwidth 
   limitation based on e.g. agreed Service Level Agreement or a 
   capacity limitation of specific links. The threshold is usually less 
   than the capacity limit, i.e., admission threshold, in order to 
   avoid congestion due to the error of estimating the actual traffic 
   load. The value of this threshold SHOULD be stored in another 
   RMD_QOSM state. 

   In this scenario end-to-end NSIS message is used as a probe packet. 
   In this case the DSCP field of the GIST message is re-marked when the 
   predefined congestion notification threshold is exceeded in an 
   interior node. It is required that the remarking happens to all 
   packets that are belonging to the congested PHB traffic class so that 
   the probe can't pass the congested router without being remarked. In 
   this way it is ensured that the end-to-end NSIS message passed 
   through the node that it is congested. This feature is very useful 
   when flow-based ECMP (Equal Cost Multiple Path) routing is used to 
   detect only flows that are passing through the congested node.
 




Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 24]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   * NSIS measurement-based admission control:
   The measurement based admission control is implemented in NSIS aware 
   stateless routers. Thus the main difference between this type of the 
   measurement-based admission control and the congestion notification-
   based admission control is the fact that the interior nodes are NSIS 
   aware nodes. In particular, the QNE Interior nodes operating 
   in NSIS measurement-based mode are QoS-NSLP stateless nodes, i.e., 
   they do not support any QoS-NSLP or NTLP/GIST states.  These 
   measurement-based nodes store two RMD-QOSM states per PHR group.  
   These states reflect the traffic conditions at the node and are not 
   affected by QoS-NSLP signaling. One state stores the measured user 
   traffic load associated with the PHR group and another state stores 
   the maximum traffic load threshold that can be admitted per PHR 
   group. When a measurement-based node receives a intra-domain RESERVE 
   message, it compares the requested resources to the available 
   resources (maximum allowed minus current load) for the requested PHR 
   group.  If there are insufficient resources, it sets the <M> bit in 
   the RMD-QSpec.  No change to the RMD-QSpec is made when there are 
   sufficient resources. 


4.3.3  Reservation-based method

   The QNE Edges maintain intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational and 
   reservation states that are containing similar data structures as 
   described in Section 4.3.1. 

   In this case the intra-domain sessions supported by the edges are per  
   flow sessions that have a one-to-one relationship to the per 
   flow end-to-end states supported by the same edge. 
   The QNE Interior nodes operating in reservation-based mode are QoS-
   NSLP reduced state nodes, i.e., they do not store NTLP/GIST states 
   but they do store per PHB-aggregated QoS-NSLP states.
 
   The reservation-based PHR installs and maintains one reservation 
   state per PHB, in all the nodes located in the communication path.
   This state is identified by the PHB class value and it maintains the 
   number of currently reserved resource units (or bandwidth).  Thus, 
   the QNE Ingress node signals only the resource units requested by 
   each flow.  These resource units, if admitted, are added to the 
   currently reserved resources per PHB.
   
   For each PHB a threshold is maintained that specifies the maximum 
   number of resource units that can be reserved. This threshold 
   could, for example, be statically configured. 

   An example of how the admission control and its maintenance process 
   occurs in the interior nodes is described in Section 3 of [CsTa05]. 





Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 25]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   The simplified concept that is used by the per traffic class 
   admission control process in the interior nodes, is based on the 
   following equation:
        last + p <= T, 
   where p: requested bandwidth rate, T: admission threshold, which 
   reflects the maximum traffic volume that can be admitted in the 
   traffic class, last: a counter that records the aggregated sum of 
   the signaled bandwidth rates of previous admitted flows.

   The per-PHB group reservation states maintained in the interior 
   nodes are soft states, which are refreshed by sending periodic 
   refresh intra-domain RESERVE messages, which are initiated by the 
   Ingress QNEs. If a refresh message corresponding to a number of 
   reserved resource units (i.e., bandwidth) is not received, the 
   aggregated reservation state is decreased in the next refresh period 
   by the corresponding amount of resources that were not refreshed. 
   The refresh period can be refined using a sliding window algorithm 
   described in [RMD3].  

   The reserved resources for a particular flow can also be 
   explicitly released from a PHB reservation state by means of a 
   intra-domain RESERVE release/tear message, which is generated by the 
   Ingress QNEs.  

   The usage of explicit release enables the instantaneous release of 
   the resources regardless of the length of the refresh period.  This 
   allows a longer refresh period, which also reduces the number of 
   periodic refresh messages.  

   Note that both in case of measurement- and (per-flow and aggregated) 
   RMD reservation-based methods,the way of how the maximum bandwidth 
   thresholds are maintained is out of the specification of this 
   document. However, when admission priorities are supported, the 
   Maximum Allocation [RFC4125] or the Russian Dolls [RFC4127] bandwidth 
   allocation model MAY be used. In this case three types of priority 
   traffic classes within the same PHB, e.g., Expedited Forwarding, can 
   be differentiated. These three different priority traffic classes, 
   which are associated to the same PHB, are denoted in this document as 
   PHB_low_priority, PHB_normal_priority and PHB_high_priority, and are 
   identified by the PHB class value and the priority value, which is 
   carried in the <Admission Priority> RMD-QSpec parameter. 


4.4.  Transport of RMD-QOSM messages
   
   As mentioned in Section 1, The RMD-QOSM aims to support a number of 
   additional requirements, e.g., Minimal Impact on Interior Node 
   Performance. Therefore, RMD-QOSM is designed be very lightweight 
   signaling with regard to the number of signaling message roundtrips 
   and the amount of state established at involved signaling nodes with 
   and without reduced state on QNEs. The actions allowed by a QNE 
   Interior node are minimal (i.e., only those specified by the RMD-
   QOSM). 

Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 26]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   For example, only the QNE Ingress and the QNE Egress nodes are 
   allowed to initiate certain signaling messages. QNE Interior nodes 
   are, for example, allowed to modify certain signaling message 
   payloads. Moroever, RMD signaling is targeted towards intra-domain 
   signaling only. Therefore, RMD-QOSM relies on the security and 
   reliability support that is provided by the bound end-to-end session, 
   which is running between the boundaries of the RMD domain (i.e., the 
   RMD-QOSM QNE edges), and the security provided by the D-mode. This 
   implies the usage of the Datagram Mode.

   Therefore, the intra-domain messages used by the RMD-QOSM are 
   intended to operate in the NTLP/GIST Datagram mode (see [GIST]). The 
   NSLP functionality available in all RMD-QOSM aware QoS NSLP nodes 
   requires from the intra-domain GIST, via the QoS-NSLP RMF API, see 
   [QoS-NSLP], to:

   * operate in unreliable mode. This can be satisfied by passing this 
     requirement from the QoS-NSLP layer to the GIST layer via the API 
     Transfer-Attributes. 
   
   * do not create a message association state. This requirement can be
     satisfied by a local policy, e.g., the QNE is configured to do not
     create a message association state

   * the interior nodes do not create any NTLP routing state. 
     This can be satisfied by passing this requirement from the QoS-NSLP 
     layer to the GIST layer via the API. However, between the QNE 
     Egress and QNE Ingress routing states that are associated with 
     intra-domain sessions SHOULD be created that can be used for the 
     communication of GIST Data messages sent by a QNE Egress directly 
     to a QNE Ingress. This type of routing state associated with an 
     intra-domain session can be generated and used in the following 
     way: 

   * When the QNE Ingress has to send an initial intra-domain RESERVE
     message, the QoS-NSLP sends this message by including in the GIST 
     API SendMessage primitive, the Unreliable and No security 
     attributes. In order to optimise this procedure, the RMD domain 
     MUST be engineered in such a way that GIST will piggyback this NSLP 
     message on a GIST QUERY message. Furthermore, GIST sets the C-flag 
     (C=1), see [GIST] and uses the Q-mode. The GIST functionality 
     in each QNE Interior node will receive the GIST QUERY message and 
     by using the RecvMessage GIST API primitive it will pass the intra-
     domain RESERVE message to the QoS-NSLP functionality. At the same 
     time the GIST functionality uses the Routing-State-Check boolean 
     to find out if the QoS-NSLP needs to create a routing state. The 
     QoS-NSLP sets this Boolean to inform GIST to not create a routing 
     state and to forward the GIST QUERY further downstream with the 
     modified QoS-NSLP payload, which will include the modified intra-
     domain RESERVE message. The intra-domain RESERVE is sent in the 
     same way up to the QNE Egress. The QNE Egress needs to create a 
     routing state. 

Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 27]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

     Therefore at the moment that the GIST functionality 
     passes the intra-domain RESERVE message, via the GIST RecvMessage 
     primitive, to the QoS-NSLP, then at the same time the QoS-NSLP 
     sets the Routing-State-Check boolean such that a routing state is 
     created. The GIST creates the routing state using normal GIST 
     procedures. After this phase the QNE Ingress and QNE Egress have, 
     for the particular session, routing states that can route traffic 
     directly from QNE Ingress to QNE Egress and from QNE Egress to 
     QNE Ingress. The routing state at the QNE Egress can be used by 
     the QoS-NSLP and GIST to send an intra-domain RESPONSE or intra-
     domain NOTIFY directly to the QNE Ingress using GIST Data 
     messages. Note that this routing state is refreshed using normal 
     GIST procedures. Note that in the above description it is 
     considered that the QNE Ingress can piggyback the initial RESERVE 
     (NSLP) message on the GIST QUERY message. If the piggybacking of  
     this NSLP (initial RESERVE) message would not be possible on the 
     GIST QUERY message, then the GIST QUERY message sent by the QNE 
     Ingress node would not contain any NSLP data. This GIST QUERY 
     message would only be processed by the QNE Egress to generate a 
     routing state. 

     After the QNE Ingress is informed that the routing state at the QNE 
     Egress is initiated, it would have to send the initial RESERVE 
     message using similar procedures as for the situation that it would 
     send an intra-domain RESERVE message that is not an initial 
     RESERVE, see next bullet. This procedure is not efficient and 
     therefore it is RECOMMENDED that the RMD domain MUST be engineered 
     in such a way that the GIST protocol layer, which is processed on a 
     QNE Ingress, will piggyback an initial RESERVE (NSLP) message on a 
     GIST QUERY message that uses the Q-mode.

   * When the QNE Ingress needs to send an intra-domain RESERVE
     message that is not an initial RESERVE, then the QoS-NSLP sends
     this message by including in the GIST API SendMessage primitive 
     such attributes that the usage of the Datagram Mode is implied, 
     e.g., Unreliable attribute. Furthermore the Local policy attribute 
     is set such that GIST sends the intra-domain RESERVE message in a 
     Q-mode even if there is a routing state at the QNE Ingress. In this 
     way the GIST functionality uses its local policy to send the intra-
     domain RESERVE message by piggybacking it on a GIST DATA message 
     and sending it in Q- mode even if there is a routing state for this 
     session. The intra-domain RESERVE message is piggybacked on the 
     GIST DATA message that is forwarded and processed by the QNE 
     Interior nodes up to the QNE Egress.
 

   The transport of the original (end-to-end) RESERVE message is 
   accomplished in the following way:
   At the QNE ingress the original (end-to-end) RESERVE message is 
   forwarded but ignored by the stateless or reduced-state nodes, see 
   Figure 3. 



Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 28]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   The intermediate (interior) nodes are bypassed using 
   multiple levels of NSLP-ID values (see [QoS-NSLP]). This is 
   accomplished by marking the end-to-end RESERVE message, i.e., 
   modifying the QoS-NSLP default NSLP-ID value to another NSLP-ID
   predefined value.

   The marking MUST be accomplished by the ingress by modifying the 
   QoS_NSLP default NSLP-ID value to a NSLP-ID predefined value. In 
   This way the egress MUST stop this marking process by reassigning 
   the QoS-NSLP default NSLP-ID value to the original (end-to-end) 
   RESERVE message. Note that the assignment of these NSLP-ID values is
   a QOS-NSLP issue, which SHOULD be accomplished via IANA [QoS-NSLP].


4.5  Edge discovery and message addressing 
   
   Mainly, the Egress node discovery can be performed either by using 
   the GIST discovery mechanism [GIST], manual configuration or any 
   other discovery technique.  The addressing of signaling messages 
   depends on the used GIST transport mode.  The RMD-QOSM/QoS-NSLP 
   signaling messages that are processed only by the Edge nodes use the 
   peer-peer addressing of the GIST connection (C) mode.  

   RMD-QOSM/QoS-NSLP signaling messages that are processed by all nodes 
   of the Diffserv domain, i.e., Edges and Interior nodes, use the end-
   end addressing of the GIST datagram (D) mode. Note that the RMD-QOSM 
   cannot directly specify that the GIST connection or the GIST datagram 
   mode SHOULD be used. This can only be specified by using, via the 
   QoS-NSLP-RMF API, the GIST API Transfer-Attributes, such as 
   reliable or unreliable, high or low level of security and by the use 
   of local policies. RMD QoS signaling messages that are addressed to 
   the data path end nodes are intercepted by the Egress nodes. In 
   particular, at the ingress and for downstream intra-domain messages, 
   the RMD-QOSM instructs the GIST functionality, via the GIST API to 
   use among others:

   * unreliable and low level security Transfer-Attributes 
   * do not create a GIST routing state
   * uses the D-mode MRI 

   The intra-domain RESERVE messages can then be transported by using 
   the Query D-mode, see Section 4.4..

   At the QNE Egress and for upstream intra-domain messages, the RMD-
   QOSM instructs the GIST functionality, via the GIST API to use among 
   others:

   *  unreliable and low level of security Transfer-Attributes 

   *  The GIST functionality uses the routing state associated with the 
      intra-domain session to send an upstream intra-domain message 
      directly to the QNE Ingress, see Section 4.4.

4.6.  Operation and sequence of events

4.6.1.  Basic unidirectional operation
   
   This section describes the basic unidirectional operation and 
   sequence of events/triggers of the RMD-QOSM.  The following basic 
   operation cases are distinguished: 

   * Successful reservation (Section 4.6.1.1), 
   * Unsuccessful reservation (Section 4.6.1.2), 
   * RMD refresh reservation (Section 4.6.1.3),
   * RMD modification of aggregated reservation (4.6.1.4)
   * RMD release procedure (Section 4.6.1.5.)
   * Severe congestion handling (Section 4.6.1.6.)
   * Admission control using congestion notification based on probing 
     (Section 4.6.1.7.).   

   The QNEs at the Edges of the RMD domain support the RMD QoS Model and 
   end-to-end QoS models, which process the RESERVE message differently. 

   Note that the term end-to-end QoS model applies to any QoS model that 
   is initiated and terminated outside the RMD-QOSM aware domain. 
   However, there might be situations where a QoS model is initiated 
   and/or terminated by the QNE Edges and is considered to be an end-to-
   end QoS model. This can occur when the QNE Edges can also operate as 
   either QNI or as QNR and at the same time they can operate as either 
   sender or receiver of the data path. 
   It is important to emphasize that the content of this section is used 
   for the specification of the following RMD-QOSM/QoS-NSLP signaling 
   schemes, when basic unidirectional operation is assumed:

    * "per flow congestion notification based on probing";

    * "per flow RMD NSIS measurement based admission control",

    * "per flow RMD reservation based" in combination with "severe 
      congestion handling by the RMD-QOSM refresh procedure" 

    * "per flow RMD reservation based" in combination with "severe 
      congestion handling by proportional data packet marking" 

    * "per aggregate RMD reservation based" in combination with 
      "severe congestion handling by the RMD-QOSM refresh procedure" 

    * "per aggregate RMD reservation based" in combination with 
      "severe congestion handling by proportional data packet marking"

   For more details, please see Section 3.2.3.





Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 30]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   In particular, the described functionality described in Sections 
   4.6.1.1, 4.6.1.2, 4.6.1.3, 4.6.1.5, 4.6.1.4 and 4.6.1.6 applies to 
   the RMD reservation-based and to the NSIS measurement-based admission 
   control methods. The described functionality in Section 4.6.1.7 
   applies to the admission control procedure that uses the congestion 
   notification based on probing. The QNE Edge nodes maintain either per 
   flow QoS-NSLP operational and reservation states or aggregated QoS-
   NSLP operational and reservation states. 
 
   When the QNE Edges maintain aggregated QoS-NSLP operational and 
   reservation states, the RMD-QOSM functionality MAY accomplish a RMD 
   modification procedure (see Section 4.6.1.4), instead of the 
   reservation initiation procedure that is described in this 
   subsection. Note that it is RECOMMENDED that the QNE implementations 
   of RMD-QOSM process the QoS-NSLP signaling messages with a higher 
   priority than data packets. This can be accomplished as described in 
   Section 3.3.4 of [QoS-NSLP] and it can be requested via the QoS-NSLP-
   RMF API described in [QoS-NSLP]. The signalling scenarios described 
   in this section are accomplished using the QoS-NSLP processing rules 
   defined in [QoS-NSLP], in combination with the RMF triggers sent via 
   the QoS-NSLP-RMF API described in [QoS-NSLP]. 
   According to Section 3.2.3 it is specified that only the "per flow 
   RMD reservation based" in combination with "severe congestion 
   handling by proportional data packet marking" scheme MUST be 
   implemented within one RMD domain. However, all RMD QNEs supporting 
   this specification MUST support the combination the "per flow RMD 
   reservation based" in combination with "severe congestion handling by 
   proportional data packet marking" scheme. If the RMD QNEs support 
   more RMD-QOSM schemes then the operator of that RMD domain MUST pre-
   configure all the QNE edge nodes within one domain such that the 
   <SCH> field included in the "PHR container", see Section 4.1.2 and 
   the "PDR Container", see Section 4.1.3, will use always the same 
   value, such that within one RMD domain only one of the below 
   described RMD-QOSM schemes is used at a time.

   All QNE nodes located within the RMD domain, MUST read and 
   interpret the <SCH> field included in the "PHR container" before 
   processing all the other "PHR container" payload fields. 
   Moreover, all QNE edge nodes located at the boarder of the RMD 
   domain, MUST read and interpret the <SCH> field included in the "PDR 
   container" before processing all the other "PDR container" payload 
   fields. 

4.6.1.1.  Successful reservation
   
   This section describes the operation of the RMD-QOSM where a 
   reservation is successfully accomplished.  

   The QNI generates the initial RESERVE message, and it is forwarded

4.6.1.1.1. Operation in Ingress node

   When an end-to-end reservation request (RESERVE) arrives at the 
   Ingress node (QNE), see Figure 8, it is processed based on the end-
   to-end QoS model.   Subsequently, the combination:   
   <TMOD-1>, <PHB Class>, <Admission Priority> are derived from the 
   <QoS Desired> object of the initial QSpec. 

   The QNE Ingress MUST maintain information about the smallest MTU that 
   is supported on the links within the RMD domain.
 
   The value of the "Maximum Packet Size-1 (MPS)" value included in the 
   end-to-end QoS Model <TMOD-1> parameter is compared with the smallest 
   MTU value that is supported by the links within the RMD domain. If 
   the "Maximum Packet Size-1 (MPS)" is larger than this smallest MTU 
   value within the RMD domain, then the end-to-end reservation request 
   is rejected, see Section 4.6.1.1.2. Otherwise, the admission process 
   continues. 

   The <TMOD-1> parameter contained in the original initiator QSPEC are 
   mapped into the equivalent RMD-Qspec <TMOD-1> parameter representing 
   only the peak bandwidth in the local RMD-QSpec. This can be 
   accomplished by setting the RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> fields as follows: 
   token rate (r) = peak traffic rate (p), the bucket depth (b) = large, 
   and the minimum policed unit (m) = large.

   Note that the bucket size, (b], is measured in bytes. Values of this 
   Parameter may range from 1 byte to 250 gigabytes, see [RFC2215]. Thus 
   the maximum value that (b) could get is in order of 250 gigabytes. 
   The minimum policed unit, [m], is an integer measured in bytes and 
   must be less than or equal to Maximum Packet Size (MPS). Thus the 
   maximum value that (m) can get is (MPS). [Part94] and [TaCh99] 
   describe a method of calculating the values of some Token Bucket 
   parameters, e.g., calculation of large values of (m) and (b), when 
   the token rate (r), peak rate (p) and MPS are known. 

   The "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" value of the end-to-end QoS Model <TMOD-1> 
   parameter is copied into the Peak Data Rate-1 (p) value of the Peak 
   Data Rate-1 (p)" value of the local RMD-Qspec <TMOD-1>.

   The MPS value of the end-to-end QoS Model <TMOD-1> parameter is 
   copied into the MPS value of the local RMD-Qspec <TMOD-1>.

   If the initial QSpec does not contain the <PHB Class> parameter, 
   then the selection of the <PHB class> that is carried by the intra-
   domain RMD-QSpec is defined by a local policy similar to the 
   procedures discussed in [RFC2998] and [RFC3175]. 
   For example, in the situation that the initial QSpec is used by 
   the IntServ Controlled Load QOSM then the Expedited Forwarding (EF) 
   PHB is appropriate to set the <PHB class> parameter carried by the 
   intra-domain RMD-QSpec, see [RFC3175].



Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 32]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   If the initial QSpec does not carry the <Admission Priority> 
   parameter then the <Admission Priority> parameter in the RMD-QSpec 
   will not be populated. If the initial QSpec does not carry the 
   <Admission Priority> parameter, but it carries other priority 
   parameters, then it is considered that edges as being stateful nodes, 
   are able to control the priority of the sessions that are 
   entering or leaving the RMD domain in accordance to the priority 
   parameters. 

   Note that the RMF reservation states, see Section 4.3, in 
   the QNE edges store the value of the <Admission Priority> parameter 
   that is used within the RMD domain in case of pre-emption and severe 
   congestion situations, see Section 4.6.1.6. 
   If the RMD domain supports pre-emption during the admission control 
   process, then the QNE Ingress node can support the building 
   blocks specified in the [QoS-NSLP] and during the admission 
   control process use the example pre-emption handling algorithm 
   described in Appendix 4.
   Note that in the above described case, the QNE egress uses, if 
   available, the tunnelled initial priority parameters, which can 
   be interpreted by the QNE egress. 

   If the initial QSpec carries the <Excess Treatment> parameter, 
   then the QNE ingress and QNE egress nodes MUST control the excess 
   traffic that is entering or leaving the RMD domain in accordance to 
   the <Excess Treatment> parameter. Note that the RMD-QSpec does not 
   carry the <Excess Treatment> parameter. 

   If the requested <TMOD-1> parameter carried by the initial QSpec, 
   cannot be satisfied, then an end to end RESPONSE message has to be 
   generated. However, in order to decide whether the end-to-end 
   reservation request was locally (at the QNE Ingress) satisfied, also   
   a local(at the QNE_Ingress) RMD-QoSM admission control procedure has 
   to be performed. In other words, the RMD-QOSM functionality has to 
   verify whether the value included in the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" 
   field of RMD-QOSM <TMOD-1> can be reserved and stored in the 
   RMD-QOSM reservation states, see Sections 4.6.1.1.2 and 4.3.

   An initial QSpec object MUST be included in the end-to-end 
   RESPONSE message. The parameters included in the QSpec <QoS 
   Reserved> object are copied from the original <QoS Desired> values. 

   The "E" flag associated with the QSPEC <QoS Reserved> object and the 
   "E" flag associated with the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter are 
   set. In addition, the INFO-SPEC object is included in the end to end 
   RESPONSE message. The error code used by this INFO-SPEC is:

   Error severity class: Transient Failure
   Error code value: Reservation failure

   Furthermore, all the other RESPONSE parameters are set according to 
   the end-to-end QoS model or according to [QoS-NSLP] and [QSP-T].


Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 33]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   If the request was satisfied locally (see Section 4.3), the Ingress 
   QNE node generates two RESERVE messages: one intra-domain and 
   one end-to-end RESERVE message. Note however, that when the 
   aggregated QOS-NSLP operational and reservation states are used by 
   the QNE Ingress, then the generation of the intra-domain RESERVE 
   message depends on the availability of the aggregated QoS-NSLP 
   operational state. If this aggregated QoS-NSLP operational state is 
   available, then the RMD modification of aggregated reservations 
   described in section 4.6.1.4. is used. 

   It is important to note that when "per flow RMD reservation based" 
   scenario is used within the RMD domain, the retransmission within the 
   RMD domain SHOULD be disallowed. The reason of this is related to the 
   fact that the QNI Interior nodes are not able to differentiate 
   between a retransmitted RESERVE message associated with a certain 
   session and an initial RESERVE message belonging to another session.
   However, the QNE Ingress have to report a failure situation upstream. 
   When the QNE Ingress transmits the (intra-domain or end-to-end) 
   RESERVE with RII object set, it waits for a RESPONSE from the QNE 
   Egress for a QOSNSLP_REQUEST_RETRY period. 

   If the QNE Ingress transmitted an intra-domain or end-to-end RESERVE 
   message with the RII object set and it fails to receive the 
   associated intra-domain or end-to-end RESPONSE, respectively, after 
   the QOSNSLP_REQUEST_RETRY period expires, it considers that the 
   reservation failed. In this case the QNE Ingress SHOULD generate an 
   end-to-end RESPONSE message that will include among others an 
   INFO-SPEC object. The error code used by this INFO-SPEC is:   
      Error severity class: Transient Failure   
      Error code value: Reservation failure   

   Furthermore, all the other RESPONSE parameters are set according to 
   the end-to-end QoS model or according to [QoS-NSLP] and [QSP-T].

   Note however, that if the retransmission within the RMD domain is not 
   disallowed then the procedure described in Appendix 
   A.5 SHOULD be used on QNE Interior nodes, see also [Chan07]. In this 
   case the stateful QNE Ingress uses the retransmission procedure 
   described in [QoS-NSLP].

   If a rerouting takes place then the stateful QNE ingress is following 
   the procedures specified in [QoS-NSLP].

   At this point the intra-domain and end-to-end operational states MUST 
   be initiated or modified according to the REQUIRED binding 
   procedures. The way of how the BOUND_SESSION_IDs are initiated and 
   maintained in the intra-domain and end-to-end QoS-NSLP operational 
   states is described in Section 4.3.1 and 4.3.2.

   These two messages are bound together in the following way. The end-
   to-end RESERVE SHOULD contain in the BOUND_SESSION_ID the SESSION_ID 
   of its bound intra-domain session. 


Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 34]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   Furthermore, if the QNE Edge nodes maintain intra-domain per flow 
   QoS-NSLP reservation states then the value of Binding_Code MUST be 
   set to code "Tunnel and end-to-end sessions", see Section 4.3.2. 

   In addition to this then the intra-domain and end-to-end RESERVE 
   messages are bound using the Message binding procedure described 
   in [QoS-NSLP]. 
   In particular the <MSG_ID> object is included in the intra-domain 
   RESERVE message and its bound <BOUND_MSG_ID> object is carried by the 
   end-to-end RESERVE message. Furthermore, the Message_Binding_Type 
   flag is SET (value is 1), such that the message dependency is bi-
   directional.
 
   If the QOS-NSLP edges maintain aggregated intra-domain QoS-NSLP 
   operational states then the value of Binding_Code MUST be set to code 
   "Aggregated sessions". 
   
   Furthermore, in this case the retransmission within the RMD domain
   is allowed and the procedures described in Appendix A.5 SHOULD be 
   used on QNE Interior nodes. This is necessary due to the fact that 
   when retransmissions are disallowed then the associated with (micro) 
   flows belonging to the aggregate will loose their reservations. Note 
   that in this case the stateful QNE Ingress uses the retransmission 
   procedure described in [QoS-NSLP].

   The intra-domain RESERVE message is associated with the (local NTLP)
   SESSION_ID mentioned above. The selection of the IP source and IP 
   destination address of this message depends on how the different 
   inter-domain (end-to-end) flows are aggregated by the QNE Ingress 
   node (see Section 4.3.1). As described in Section 4.3.1, the QNE 
   Edges maintain either per flow, or aggregated QoS-NSLP reservation 
   states for the RMD QoS model, which are identified by (local NTLP) 
   SESSION_IDs (see [GIST]). Note that this NTLP SESSION ID is a 
   different one than the SESSION_ID associated with the end-to-end 
   RESERVE message. 

   If no QOS-NSLP aggregation procedure at the QNE Edges is supported 
   then the IP source and IP destination address of this message MUST be 
   equal to the IP Source and IP destination addresses of the data flow. 
   The intra-domain RESERVE message is sent using the NTLP datagram 
   mode (see Sections 4.4, 4.5). Note that the GIST datagram mode can be 
   selected using the unreliable GIST API Transfer-Attributes. In 
   addition, the intra-domain RESERVE (RMD-QSpec) message MUST include a 
   PHR container (PHR_Resource_Request) and the RMD QOSM <QoS Desired> 
   object.

   The end-to-end RESERVE message includes the initial QSpec and it 
   is sent towards the Egress QNE. 

   Note that after completing the initial discovery phase, the GIST 
   connection mode can be used between the QNE Ingress and QNE Egress. 
   Note that the GIST connection mode can be selected using the reliable 
   GIST API Transfer-Attributes.
   
Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 35]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   The end-to-end RESERVE message is forwarded using the GIST 
   forwarding procedure to bypass the Interior stateless or reduced-
   state QNE nodes, see Figure 8.  The bypassing procedure is 
   described in Section 4.4. 

   At the QNE Ingress the end-to-end RESERVE message is marked, i.e., 
   modifying the QoS-NSLP default NSLP-ID value to another NSLP-ID 
   predefined value that will be used by the GIST message carrying the 
   end-to-end RESPONSE message to bypass the QNE Interior nodes. Note 
   that the QNE Interior nodes, see [GIST], are configured to handle 
   only certain NSLP-Ids, see [QoS-NSLP].
   Furthermore, note that the initial discovery phase and the process of
   sending the end-to-end RESERVE message towards the QNE Egress MAY be 
   done simultaneously. This can be accomplished only if the GIST 
   implementation is configured to perform that, via e.g., a local 
   policy. However, the selection of the discovery procedure cannot be 
   selected by the RMD-QOSM. 
  
   The (initial) intra-domain RESERVE message MUST be sent by the QNE 
   Ingress and it MUST contain the following values (see QoS-NSLP-RMF 
   API described in [QoS-NSLP]):
   *  the value of the <RSN> object is generated and processed as 
      described in [QoS-NSLP];
   
   *  the SCOPING flag MUST NOT be set, meaning that a default 
      scoping of the message is used.  Therefore, the QNE Edges MUST 
      be configured as RMD boundary nodes and the QNE Interior nodes 
      MUST be configured as Interior (intermediary) nodes;
   
   *  the <RII> MUST be included in this message, see [QoS-NSLP].
   
   *  The flag REPLACE MUST be set to FALSE = 0;

*  The value of the Message ID value carried by the <MSG_ID> object 
   is set according to [QoS-NSLP]. The value of the 
   Message_binding_Type is set to "1".
   
*  the value of the <REFRESH_PERIOD> object MUST be calculated 
   and set by the QNE Ingress node as described in Section 4.6.1.3;

*  the value of the <PACKET_CLASSIFIER> object is associated with 
   the path-coupled routing MRM, since RMD-QOSM is used with the 
   path-coupled MRM. The flag that has to be set is the flag T (traffic 
   class) meaning that the packet classification of packets is based on 
   the DSCP value included in the IP header of the packets. Note that 
   the DSCP value used in the MRI can be derived by the value of <PHB 
   class> parameter, which MUST be carried by the intra-domain RESERVE 
   message. Note that the QNE Ingress being a QNI for the intra-domain 
   session it can pass this value to GIST, via the GIST API.    

*  the PHR resource units MUST be included into the 
   "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" field of the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1>  
   parameter of the "<QoS Desired> object. 

Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 36]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   When the QNE edges use per flow intra-domain QoS-NSLP states, then 
   the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" value included in the initial QSpec 
   <TMOD-1> parameter is copied into the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" value of 
   the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter. 

   When the QNE edges use aggregated intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational 
   states, then the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" value of the the local RMD-
   QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter  can be obtained by using the bandwidth 
   aggregation method described in Section 4.3.1;
 
*  the value of the <PHB class> parameter can be defined by using the 
   method of copying the <PHB Class> parameter carried by 
   the initial QSpec into the <PHB class> carried by the RMD-QSpec, 
   which is described above in this subsection. 
   
*  the value of the Container ID field of the PHR container
   MUST be set to 17, (i.e., PHR_Resource_Request;)
   
*  the value of the <Admitted Hops> parameter in the PHR container 
   MUST be set to "1". Note that during a successful reservation each 
   time a RMD-QOSM aware node processes the RMD-QSpec, the <Admitted 
   Hops> parameter is increased by one.
 
*  the value of the <Hop_U> parameter in the PHR container MUST be 
   set to "0";

*  the value of the <Max Admitted Hops> is set to "0".

*  If the initial QSpec carried an <Admission Priority> 
   parameter, then this parameter SHOULD be copied into the RMD-QSpec 
   and carried by the (initiating) intra-domain RESERVE. 

   Note that for the RMD-QOSM a reservation established without an 
   <Admission Priority> parameter is equivalent to a reservation with 
   <Admission Priority> value 1. 
   Note that in this case each admission priority is associated with  
   a priority traffic class. The three priority traffic classes 
   (PHB_low_priority, PHB_normal_priority, PHB_high_priority) MAY be 
   associated with the same PHB, see Section 4.3.3.

*  In a single RMD domain case the PDR container MAY not be included 
   into the message.

   Note that the intra-domain RESERVE message does not carry the   
   BOUND_SESSION_ID object. The reason of this is that the end-to-end 
   RESERVE carries in the BOUND_SESSION_ID object the SESSION_ID value 
   of the intra-domain session.

   When an end-to-end RESPONSE message is received by the QNE 
   Ingress node, which was sent by a QNE Egress node see Section 
   4.6.1.1.3, then it is processed according to [QoS-NSLP] 
   and end-to-end QoS model rules.


Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 37]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   When an intra-domain RESPONSE message is received by the QNE Ingress 
   node, which was sent by a QNE Egress see Section 4.6.1.1.3, it uses 
   the QoS-NSLP procedures to match it to the earlier sent intra-domain 
   RESERVE message. After this phase, the RMD-QSpec has to be identified 
   and processed.

   The RMD QoSM reservation has been successful if the <M> bit carried 
   by the "PDR Container" is equal to "0" (i.e., not set).
   Furthermore, the INFO_SPEC object is processed as defined in the 
   QoS-NSLP specification. In case of successful reservation the 
   INFO_SPEC object MUST have the following values:

   * Error Severity Class: Success 
   * Error Code value: Reservation successful 

   If the end-to-end RESPONSE message has to be forwarded to a 
   node outside the RMD-QOSM aware domain then the values of
   the objects contained in this message (i.e., <RII/RSN>, <INFO_SPEC>,
   [QSPEC ]) MUST be set by the QOS-NSLP protocol functions of the QNE. 
   If an end-to-end QUERY is received by the QNE Ingress then the same 
   bypassing procedure has to be used as the one applied for an end-to-
   end RESERVE message. In particular, it is forwarded using the GIST 
   forwarding procedure to bypass the Interior stateless or reduced-
   state QNE nodes.   

4.6.1.1.2 Operation in the Interior nodes

   Each QNE Interior node MUST use the QoS-NSLP and RMD-QOSM parameters 
   of the intra-domain RESERVE (RMD-QSpec) message as follows (see 
   QoS-NSLP-RMF API described in [QoS-NSLP]): 
   
  *   the values of the <RSN>, <RII>, <PACKET_CLASSIFIER>, 
      <REFRESH_PERIOD>, objects MUST NOT be changed. 
      The interior node is informed by the <PACKET_CLASSIFIER> object
      that the packet classification SHOULD be done on the DSCP value.  
      The flag that has to be set in this case is the flag T (traffic 
      class). The value of the DSCP value MUST be obtained via the MRI 
      parameters that the QoS-NSLP receives from GIST. A QNE Interior 
      MUST be able to associate the value carried by the RMD-QSpec <PHB 
      class> parameter and the DSCP value obtained via GIST. This is 
      REQUIRED, because there are situations that the <PHB class> 
      parameter is not carrying a DSCP value, but a "PHB ID code", see 
      Section 4.1.1.

   *  The flag REPLACE MUST be set to FALSE = 0;

   *  when the RMD reservation based methods described in Section 4.3.1 
      and 4.3.3 are used, the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" value of the 
      local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter is used by the QNE Interior 
      node for admission control. Furthermore, if the 
      <Admission Priority> parameter is carried by the RMD-QOSM 
      <QoS Desired> object, then this parameter is processed as 
      described in the following bullets. 
   
Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 38]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   *  in case of the RMD reservation-based procedure, and if these 
      resources are admitted (see Section 4.3.1, 4.3.3), they are added 
      to the currently reserved resources. Furthermore, the value of the 
      <Admitted Hops> parameter in the PHR container has to be increased 
      by one. 

   *  If the bandwidth allocated for the PHB_high_priority traffic is 
      fully utilized, and a high priority request arrives, other 
      policies on allocating bandwidth can be used, which are beyond the 
      scope of this document.
      
   *  If the RMD domain supports pre-emption during the admission 
      control process, then the QNE Interior node can support the 
      building blocks specified in the [QoS-NSLP] and during the 
      admission control process use the pre-emption handling algorithm 
      specified in Appendix 4.
         
   *  in case of the RMD measurement based method (see Section 4.3.2), 
      and if the requested into the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" value of the 
      local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter is admitted, using a MBAC 
      algorithm, then the number of this resources will be used to 
      update the MBAC algorithm according to the operation described in 
      Section 4.3.2.


4.6.1.1.3 Operation in the Egress node   

   When the end-to-end RESERVE message is received by the egress node, 
   it is only forwarded further, towards QNR, if the processing of the 
   intra-domain RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) message was successful at all nodes 
   in the RMD domain. In this case, the QNE Egress MUST stop the marking 
   process that was used to bypass the QNE Interior nodes by reassigning 
   the QoS-NSLP default NSLP-ID value to the end-to-end RESERVE message, 
   see Section 4.4. Furthermore, the carried BOUND_SESSION_ID object 
   associated with the intra-domain session MUST be removed after 
   processing. Note that the received end to end RESERVE was tunneled 
   within the RMD domain. Therefore, the tunnelled initial QSpec 
   carried by the end-to-end RESERVE message has to be processed/set 
   according to the [QSP-T] specification. 

   If a rerouting takes place, then the stateful QNE egress is following 
   the procedures specified in [QoS-NSLP].
   At this point the intra-domain and end-to-end operational states MUST 
   be initiated or modified according to the REQUIRED binding 
   procedures.

   The way of how the BOUND_SESSION_IDs are initiated and maintained in 
   the intra-domain and end-to-end QoS-NSLP operational states is 
   described in Section 4.3.1 and 4.3.2.

   If the processing of the intra-domain RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) was not 
   successful at all nodes in the RMD domain then the inter-domain (end-
   to-end) reservation is considered as being failed.

   Furthermore, if the initial QSpec object used an object combination 
   of type 1 or, 2, where the <QoS Available> is populated, and the 
   intra-domain RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) was not successful at all nodes in 
   the RMD domain it MUST be considered that the QoS Available is not 
   satisfied and that the the inter-domain (end-to-end) reservation is 
   considered as being failed. 
   Furthermore, note that when the QNE Egress uses per flow intra-domain 
   QoS-NSLP operational states, see Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3, the QNE 
   Egress SHOULD support the message binding procedure described in 
   [QoS-NSLP], which can be used to synchronize the arrival of the end 
   to end RESERVE and the intra-domain RESERVE (RMD-QSpec) messages, see 
   Section 5.7 and QoS-NSLP-RMF API described in [QoS-NSLP]. Note that 
   the intra-domain RESERVE message carries the <MSG_ID> object and its 
   bound end-to-end RESERVE message carries the <BOUND_MSG_ID> object. 
   Both these objects carry the Message_Binding_Type flag set to the 
   value of 1. If these two messages do not arrive during the time 
   defined by the MsgIDWait timer, then the reservation is considered as 
   being failed. Note that the timer has to be pre-configured and it has 
   to have the same value in the RMD domain. In this case an end-to-end 
   RESPONSE message, see QoS-NSLP-RMF API described in [QoS-NSLP], is 
   sent towards the QNE ingress with the following INFO_SPEC values:

   Error Class: Transient Failure
   Error Code: Mismatch synchronization between end-to-end RESERVE 
   and intra-domain RESERVE 

   When the intra-domain RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) is received by the QNE 
   Egress node of the session associated with the intra-domain 
   RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) (the PHB session) with the session included in  
   its <BOUND_SESSION_ID> object MUST be bound according to the 
   specification given in [QoS-NSLP].  The SESSION_ID included 
   in the BOUND_SESSION_ID parameter stored in the intra-domain QoS-NSLP 
   operational state object is the SESSION_ID of the session associated 
   with the end-to-end RESERVE message(s). Note that if the QNE Edge 
   nodes maintain per flow intra-domain QoS NSLP operational states then 
   the value of Binding_Code = (Tunnel and end-to-end sessions) is used 
   If the QNE Edge nodes maintain per aggregated QoS-NSLP intra-domain 
   reservation states then the value of Binding_Code = (Aggregated 
   sessions), see Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.2.

   If the RMD domain supports pre-emption during the admission control 
   process, then the QNE Egress node can support the building 
   blocks specified in the [QoS-NSLP] and during the admission 
   control process use the example pre-emption handling algorithm 
   described in Appendix 4.
   The end-to-end RESERVE message is generated/forwarded further 
   upstream according to the [QoS-NSLP] and [QSP-T] specifications. 
   Furthermore, the "B" (BREAK) QoS-NSLP flag in the end to end 
   RESERVE message MUST NOT be set, see QoS-NSLP-RMF API described in 
   QoS-NSLP.

Figure 8: Basic operation of successful reservation procedure used by 
          the RMD-QOSM

   The QNE Egress MUST generate an intra-domain RESPONSE (RMD-Qspec) 
   message. The intra-domain RESPONSE (RMD-QSpec) message MUST 
   be sent to the QNE Ingress node, i.e., the previous stateful hop by 
   using the procedures described in Sections 4.4 and 4.5. 
   The values of the RMD-QSpec that is carried by the intra-domain 
   RESPONSE message MUST be used and/or set in the following way 
   (see QoS-NSLP-RMF API described in [QoS-NSLP]):

   *  the RII object carried by the intra-domain RESERVE message, see 
      Section 4.6.1.1.1, has to be copied and carried by the 
      intra-domain RESPONSE message.

   *  the value of the Container ID field of the PDR container
      MUST be set "23" (i.e., PDR_Reservation_Report);
      
   *  the value of the <M> field of the PDR container MUST be equal to 
      the value of the <M> parameter of the PHR container that was 
      carried by its associated intra-domain RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) 
      message. This is REQUIRED since the value of the <M> parameter is 
      used to indicate the status if the RMD reservation request to the 
      Ingress edge.
      
   If the binding between the intra-domain session and the end-to-end 
   session uses a Binding_Code is (Aggregated sessions), and there is no 
   aggregated QoS-NSLP operational state associated with the intra-
   domain session available, then the RMD modification of aggregated 
   reservation procedure described in Section 4.6.1.4. can be used. 

Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 41]

   If the QNE Egress receives an end-to-end RESPONSE message, it is 
   processed and forwarded towards the QNE Ingress. In particular, the 
   non-default values of the objects contained in the end-to-end 
   RESPONSE message MUST be used and/or set by the QNE Egress as 
   follows (see QoS-NSLP-RMF API described in [QoS-NSLP]):
   
   * the values of the <RII/RSN>, <INFO_SPEC>, [ QSPEC ] objects are 
     set according to [QoS-NSLP] and/or [QSP-T]. The INFO_SPEC object 
     SHOULD be set by the QoS-NSLP functionality. In case of successful 
     reservation the INFO_SPEC object SHOULD have the following values: 
     Error Severity Class: Success, 
     Error Code value: Reservation successful, 

   * Furthermore, an initial QSpec object MUST be included in the 
     end-to-end RESPONSE message. The parameters included in the QSPEC 
    <QoS Reserved> object are copied from the original <QoS Desired> 
     values.

   The end-to-end RESPONSE message are delivered as normal, i.e., 
   is addressed and sent to its upstream QoS-NSLP neighbor, i.e., QNE 
   Ingress node. 

   Note that if a QNE Egress receives an end-to-end QUERY that was 
   bypassed through the RMD domain, it MUST stop the marking 
   process that was used to bypass the QNE Interior nodes. This can be 
   done by reassigning the QoS-NSLP default NSLP-ID value to the end-to-
   end QUERY message, see Section 4.4. 


4.6.1.2.  Unsuccessful reservation
   
   This section describes the operation where a request for reservation 
   cannot be satisfied by the RMD-QOSM.  

   The QNE Ingress, the QNE Interior and QNE Egress nodes process and 
   forward the end-to-end RESERVE message and the intra-domain 
   RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) message in a similar way as specified in Section 
   4.6.1.1.  The main difference between the unsuccessful operation and 
   successful operation is that one of the QNE nodes does not admit the 
   request due to e.g., lack of resources.  This also means that the QNE 
   edge node MUST NOT forward the end-to-end RESERVE message towards the 
   QNR node.

   Note that the described functionality applies to the RMD reservation-
   based methods, see Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.2, and to the NSIS 
   measurement-based admission control method, see Section 4.3.2.  
   The QNE Edge nodes maintain either per flow QoS-NSLP reservation 
   states or aggregated QoS-NSLP reservation states. When the QNE edges 
   maintain aggregated QoS-NSLP reservation states, the RMD-QOSM 
   functionality MAY accomplish a RMD modification procedure (see 
   Section 4.6.1.4.), instead of the reservation initiation procedure 
   that is described in this subsection.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

4.6.1.2.1 Operation in the Ingress nodes

   When an end-to-end RESERVE message arrives at the QNE Ingress and 
   if: (1) the "Maximum Packet Size-1 (MPS)" included in the end-to-end 
   QoS Model <TMOD-1> is larger than this smallest MTU value within the 
   RMD domain, or (2) there are no resources available, the QNE Ingress 
   MUST reject this end-to-end RESERVE message and send an end-to-end 
   RESPONSE message back to the sender, as described in the QoS-NSLP 
   specification, see [QoS-NSLP] and [QSP-T].

   When an end-to-end RESPONSE message is received by an Ingress 
   node, see Section 4.6.1.2.3, the values of the <RII/RSN>, 
   [<INFO_SPEC> ], [<QSPEC>] objects are processed according to the QoS-
   NSLP procedures. 

   If the end-to-end RESPONSE message has to be forwarded upstream to a 
   node outside the RMD-QOSM aware domain then the values of
   the objects contained in this message (i.e., <RII/RSN>, <INFO_SPEC>,
   [ QSPEC ]) MUST be set by the QOS-NSLP protocol functions of the QNE.

   When an intra-domain RESPONSE message is received by the QNE Ingress 
   node, which was sent by a QNE Egress, see Section 4.6.1.2.3, it uses 
   the QoS-NSLP procedures to match it to the earlier sent intra-domain 
   RESERVE message. After this phase, the RMD-QSpec has to be identified 
   and processed. Note that in this case the RMD Resource Management 
   Function (RMF) is notified that the reservation has been 
   unsuccessful, by reading the <M> parameter of the PDR container.
   Note that when the QNE edges maintain a per flow QoS-NSLP reservation 
   state the RMD-QOSM functionality, has to start an RMD release 
   procedure (see Section 4.6.1.5). When the QNE edges maintain 
   aggregated QoS-NSLP reservation states the RMD-QOSM functionality MAY 
   start a RMD modification procedures (see Section 4.6.1.4.).


4.6.1.2.2 Operation in the Interior nodes

   In case of the RMD reservation based scenario, and if the 
   intra-domain reservation request is not admitted by the QNE Interior 
   node then the <Hop_U> and <M> parameters of the PHR container MUST be
   set to "1".  The <Admitted Hops> counter MUST NOT be increased. 
   Moreover, the value of the <Max Admitted Hops> MUST be set equal to 
   the <Admitted Hops> value.
   Furthermore, the "E" flag associated with the QSpec <QoS Desired> 
   object and the "E" flag associated with the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> 
   parameter SHOULD be set. In case of the RMD measurement based 
   scenario, the <M> parameter of the PHR container MUST be set to "1". 
   Furthermore, the "E" flag associated with the QSpec <QoS Desired> 
   object and the "E" flag associated with the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1>  
   parameter SHOULD be set. Note that the <M> flag seems to be set in a 
   similar way as the "E" flag used by the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1>  
   parameter. However, the ways of how the two flags are processed by a 
   QNE are different.


Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 43]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   In general, if a QNE Interior node receives a RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1>
   parameter with the "E" flag set and a PHR container type 
   "PHR_Resource_Request", with the <M> parameter set to "1" , then this 
   "PHR Container" and the RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired> object) MUST NOT be 
   processed. Furthermore, when the <K> parameter that is included in 
   the "PHR Container" and carried by a RESERVE message is set to "1", 
   then this "PHR Container" and the RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired> object) MUST 
   NOT be processed.

4.6.1.2.3 Operation in the Egress nodes

   In the RMD reservation based, see Sections 4.3.3, and the RMD NSIS 
   measurement based scenario, see Section 4.3.2, when the <M> marked 
   intra-domain RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) is received by the QNE Egress node 
   (see Figure 9) the session associated with the intra-domain 
   RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) (the PHB session) and the end-to-end session MUST 
   be bound.
   Moreover, if the initial QSpec object (used by the end-to-end QoS 
   model) used an object combination of type 1 or, 2, where the <QoS 
   Available> is populated, and the intra-domain RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) was 
   not successful at all nodes in the RMD domain, i.e., the intra-domain 
   RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) message is marked, it MUST be considered that the 
   QoS Available is not satisfied and that the inter-domain (end-to-
   end) reservation is considered as being failed. 
   

   When the QNE Egress uses per flow intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational 
   states, see Section 4.3.2 and 4.3.3, then the QNE Egress node MUST 
   generate an end-to-end RESPONSE message that has to be sent to its 
   previous stateful QoS-NSLP hop (see QoS-NSLP-RMF API described in
   [QoS-NSLP]). 

   *  the values of the <RII/RSN>, <INFO_SPEC> objects are set 
      by the standard QoS-NSLP protocol functions. In case of the
      unsuccessful reservation the INFO_SPEC object SHOULD have the 
      following values: 
      Error Severity Class: Transient Failure
      Error Code value: Reservation failure

   The QSpec that was carried by the end to end RESERVE belonging to the 
   same session as this end-to-end RESPONSE is included in this message. 

   In particular, the parameters included in the QSpec <QoS Reserved> 
   object of the end-to-end RESPONSE message are copied
   from the initial <QoS Desired> values included in its associated 
   end-to-end RESERVE message. The "E" flag associated with 
   the QSpec <QoS Reserved> object and the "E" flag associated with the 
   <TMOD-1> parameter included in the end-to-end RESPONSE are set. 

   In addition to the above, similarly to the successful operation, 
   see Section 4.6.1.1.3, the QNE Egress MUST generate an intra-domain 
   RESPONSE message that has to be sent to its previous stateful QoS-
   NSLP hop.

   The values of the <RII/RSN>, <INFO_SPEC> objects are set by 
   the standard QoS-NSLP protocol functions. In case of the unsuccessful 
   reservation the INFO_SPEC object SHOULD have the following values 
   (see QoS-NSLP-RMF API described in [QoS-NSLP]): 
      Error Severity Class: Transient Failure
      Error Code value: Reservation failure

   The values of the RMD-QSpec MUST be used and/or set 
   in the following way (see QoS-NSLP-RMF API described in [QoS-NSLP]):
   *  the value of the <PDR Control Type> of the PDR container MUST be 
      set to "23" (PDR_Reservation_Report);
   
   *  the value of the <Max Admitted Hops> parameter of the PHR 
       container included in the received <M> marked intra-domain 
      RESERVE (RMD-QSpec)  MUST be included
      in the <Max Admitted Hops> parameter of the PDR container;

   *  the value of the <M> parameter of the PDR container MUST be "1".

   4.6.1.3 RMD refresh reservation
   
   In case of RMD measurement-based method, see Section 4.3.2, QoS-NSLP 
   reservation states in the RMD domain are typically not maintained, 
   therefore, this method typically does not use an intra-domain refresh 
   procedure.

Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 45]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   However, there are measurement based optimization schemes, 
   see [GrTs03], which MAY use the refresh procedures described in 
   Sections 4.6.1.3.1, and 4.6.1.3.3. However, this measurement based 
   optimization schemes can only be applied in the RMD domain if the QNE 
   edges are configured to perform intra-domain refresh procedures and 
   if all the QNE interior nodes are configured to perform the 
   measurement based optimization schemes. 

   In the description given in this subsection it is assumed that the 
   RMD measurement based scheme does not use the refresh procedures.

   When the QNE edges maintain aggregated or per flow QoS-NSLP 
   operational and reservation states, see Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.3, 
   then the refresh procedures are very similar. If the RESERVE messages 
   arrive within the soft state time-out period, the corresponding 
   number of resource units are not removed. However, the transmission 
   of the intra-domain and end-to-end (refresh) RESERVE message are not 
   necessarily synchronized. Furthermore, the generation of the end-to-
   end RESERVE message, by the QNE edges, depends on the locally 
   maintained refreshed interval (see [QoS-NSLP]).

4.6.1.3.1 Operation in the Ingress node

   The Ingress node MUST be able to generate an intra-domain (refresh) 
   RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) at any time defined by the refresh period/timer. 
   Before generating this message, the RMD QoS signaling model 
   functionality is using the RMD traffic class (PHR) resource units for 
   refreshing the RMD traffic class state.

   Note that the RMD traffic class refresh periods MUST be equal in 
   all QNE edge and QNE Interior nodes and SHOULD be smaller (default: 
   more than two times smaller) than the refresh period at the QNE 
   Ingress node used by the end-to-end RESERVE message. The intra-domain 
   RESERVE (RMD-QSpec) message MUST include a RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired> and 
   a PHR container (i.e., PHR_Refresh_Update).   

   An example of this refresh operation can be seen in Figure 10.

   Most of the non-default values of the objects contained in this 
   message MUST be used and set by the QNE Ingress in the same 
   way as described in Section 4.6.1.1.  The following objects are 
   used and/or set differently:

  *  the PHR resource units MUST be included into the 
     "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" field of the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1>  
     parameter. The "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" field value of the local RMD-
     QSpec <TMOD-1>  parameter depends on how the different inter domain 
     (end-to-end) flows are aggregated by the QNE Ingress node (e.g., 
     the sum of all the PHR requested resources of the aggregated 
     flows), see Section 4.3.1. If no QOS-NSLP aggregation is 
     accomplished by the QNE Ingress node, the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" 
     value of the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter SHOULD be equal to 
     the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" value of the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1>  
     parameter of its associated new (initial) intra-domain RESERVE 
     (RMD-QSpec) message, see Section 4.3.3.;

   *  the value of the Container field of the "PHR Container" 
       MUST be set to "19", i.e., "PHR_Refresh_Update";

   When the intra-domain RESPONSE (RMD-QSpec) message, see Section 
   4.6.1.3.3., is received by the QNE Ingress node, then:
   
   *  the values of the <RII/RSN>, <INFO_SPEC>, [QSP-T] objects are 
      processed by the standard QoS-NSLP protocol functions (see Section 
      4.6.1.1.);

   *  the "PDR Container" has to be processed by the RMD-QOSM 
      functionality in the QNE Ingress node.  The RMD-QOSM functionality
      is notified by the <PDR M> parameter of the PDR container 
      that the refresh procedure has been successful or unsuccessful.  
      All session(s) (when aggregated QoS-NSLP operational and 
      reservation states are used, see Section 4.3.1, there will be more 
      than one sessions) associated with this RMD specific refresh 
      session MUST be informed about the success or failure of the 
      refresh procedure.  In case of failure, the QNE Ingress node has 
      to generate (in a standard QoS-NSLP way) an error end-to-end 
      RESPONSE message that will be sent towards QNI.


4.6.1.3.2 Operation in the Interior node

   The intra-domain RESERVE (RMD-QSpec) message is received and 
   processed by the QNE Interior nodes.  Any QNE edge or QNE Interior 
   node that receives a "PHR_Refresh_Update" field 
   MUST identify the traffic class state (PHB) (using the 
   <PHB Class> parameter).  Most of the parameters in this refresh 
   intra-domain RESERVE (RMD-QSpec) message MUST be used and/or set by 
   a QNE Interior node in the same way as described in Section 4.6.1.1.

   The following objects are used and/or set differently:


Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 47]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM
   
   * the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" value of the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1>  
     parameter of the RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired> is used by the QNE Interior 
     node for refreshing the RMD traffic class state. These resources   
     (included in the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" value of local RMD-QSpec 
     <TMOD-1>), if reserved, are added to the currently reserved
     resources per PHB and therefore they will become a part of 
     the per traffic class (per-PHB) reservation state, see Sections 
     4.3.1 and 4.3.3. If the refresh procedure cannot be fulfilled then 
     the <M> and <S> fields carried by the PHR container MUST be set to 
     "1". 
     
   * Furthermore, the "E" flag associated with <QoS Desired> object and 
     the "E" flag associated with the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1>  
     parameter SHOULD be set.

   Any PHR container of type "PHR_Refresh_Update", and its associated 
   local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1>, whether it is marked or not and independent 
   of the "E" flag value of the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter, is 
   always processed, but marked bits are not changed.


4.6.1.3.3 Operation in the Egress node

   The intra-domain RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) message is received and 
   processed by the QNE Egress node.  A new intra-domain RESPONSE 
   (RMD-QSpec) message is generated by the QNE Egress node and MUST 
   include a PDR (type PDR_Refresh_Report).

   The (refresh) intra-domain RESPONSE (RMD-QSpec) message MUST be sent  
   to the QNE Ingress node, i.e., the previous stateful hop. The 
   (refresh) intra-domain RESPONSE (RMD-QSpec) message MUST be  
   explicitly routed to the QNE Ingress node, i.e., the previous 
   stateful hop, using the procedures described in Section 4.5.  
   
   *  the values of the <RII/RSN>, <INFO_SPEC> objects are set 
     by the standard QoS-NSLP protocol functions, see [QoS-NSLP]. 

   * The value of the <PDR Control Type> parameter of the PDR container
     MUST be set "24" (i.e. PDR_Refresh_Report).
     In case of successful reservation the INFO_SPEC object SHOULD 
     have the following values: 
     Error Severity Class: Success
     Error Code value: Reservation successful

   * In case of unsuccessful reservation the INFO_SPEC object SHOULD  
     have the following values: 
     Error Severity Class: Transient Failure
     Error Code value: Reservation failure






Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 48]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   The RMD-QSpec that was carried by the intra-domain RESERVE 
   belonging to the same session as this intra-domain RESPONSE is 
   included in the intra-domain RESPONSE message. The parameters 
   included in the QSPec <QoS Reserved> object are copied from the 
   original <QoS Desired> values. If the reservation is unsuccessful 
   then "E" flag associated with the QSpec <QoS Reserved> object and the 
   "E" flag associated with the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter are 
   set. Furthermore, the <M> and <S> PDR Container bits are set to "1".


4.6.1.4.  RMD modification of aggregated reservations
   
   In the case when the QNE edges maintain QoS-NSLP aggregated 
   operational and reservation states and the aggregated reservation has 
   to be modified (see Section 4.3.1) the following procedure is 
   applied:  

   * When the modification request requires an increase of the reserved 
     resources, the QNE Ingress node MUST include the corresponding 
     value into the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" value of the local RMD-QSpec 
     <TMOD-1> parameter of the RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired> which is sent 
     together with a "PHR_Resource_Request" control information.  If a 
     QNE edge or QNE Interior node is not able to reserve the number of 
     requested resources, the "PHR_Resource_Request" that is associated 
     with the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter MUST be <M> marked, 
     i.e., the <M> bit is set to the value of "1".  In this situation 
     the RMD specific operation for unsuccessful reservation will be 
     applied (see Section 4.6.1.2).   

   * When the modification request requires a decrease of the 
     reserved resources, the QNE Ingress node MUST include this value 
     into the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" value of the local RMD-QSpec 
     <TMOD-1>  parameter of the RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired>. Subsequently an 
     RMD release procedure SHOULD be accomplished (see Section 4.6.1.5). 
     Note that if the complete bandwidth associated with the aggregated 
     reservation maintained at the QNE ingress does not have to be 
     released then the TEAR flag MUST be set to OFF. This is because the 
     NSLP operational states associated with the aggregated reservation 
     states at the edge QNEs MUST NOT be turned off. However, if the 
     complete bandwidth associated with the aggregated reservation 
     maintained at the QNE ingress has to be released, then the TEAR 
     flag MUST be set to ON.
   
   It is important to be emphasized that this RMD modification scheme 
   applies only to the following two RMD-QOSM schemes:

    * "per aggregate RMD reservation based" in combination with
       "severe congestion handling by the RMD-QOSM refresh procedure";

    * "per aggregate RMD reservation based" in combination with
        "severe congestion handling by proportional data packet marking.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

4.6.1.5  RMD release procedure
   
   This procedure is applied to all RMD mechanisms that maintain 
   reservation states. If a refresh RESERVE message does not arrive at a 
   QNE Interior node within the refresh time-out period then the 
   bandwidth requested by this refresh RESERVE message is not updated. 
   This will mean that the reserved bandwidth associated with the 
   reduced state is decreased in the next refresh period by the amount 
   of the corresponding bandwidth that has not been refreshed, see 
   section 4.3.3. 


   This soft state behavior provides certain robustness for the system 
   ensuring that unused resources are not reserved for long time.  
   Resources can be removed by an explicit release at any time. However, 
   in the situation that an end-to-end (tear) RESERVE is retransmitted, 
   see Section 5.2.4 in [QoS-NSLP], then this message MUST NOT initiate 
   an intra-domain (tear) RESERVE message. This is because the amount 
   bandwidth within the RMD domain associated with the (tear) end-to-end 
   RESERVE has already been released and therefore, this amount of 
   bandwidth within the RMD domain MUST NOT once again be released. 

   When the RMD-RMF of a QNE edge or QNE Interior node processes a 
   "PHR_Release_Request"  PHR container it MUST identify the 
   <PHB Class> parameter and estimate the time period that elapsed 
   after the previous refresh, see also Section 3 of [CsTa05]. 

   This MAY be done by indicating the time lag, say "T_lag", between the 
   last sent "PHR_Refresh_Update" and the "PHR_Release_Request" control 
   information container by the QNE Ingress node, see [RMD1] and 
   [CsTa05] for more details.  The value of "T_Lag" 
   is first normalized to the length of the refresh period, say 
   "T_period".  The ratio between the "T_Lag" and the length of the 
   refresh period, "T_period", is calculated.  This ratio is then 
   introduced into the <Time Lag> field of the "PHR_Release_Request".
   When the above mentioned procedure of indicating the "T_lag" is used 
   and when a node (QNE Egress or QNE Interior) receives the 
   "PHR_Release_Request" PHR container, it MUST store the arrival 
   time.  Then it MUST calculate the time difference, "Tdiff", between 
   the arrival time and the start of the current refresh period, 
   "T_period".  Furthermore, this node MUST derive the value of the 
   "T_Lag", from the <Time Lag> parameter. "T_Lag" can be found by 
   multiplying the value included in the <Time Lag> parameter with the 
   length of the refresh period, "T_period". If the derived time lag, 
   "T_lag", is smaller than the calculated time difference, "T_diff", 
   then this node MUST decrease the PHB reservation state with the 
   number of resource units indicated in the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" 
   field of the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter of the RMD-QOSM <QoS 
   Desired> that has been sent together with the "PHR_Release_Request" 
   "PHR Container", but not below zero.

   An RMD specific release procedure can be triggered by an end-to-end 
   RESERVE with a TEAR flag set ON (see Section 4.6.1.5.1) or it can be 
   triggered by either an intra-domain RESPONSE, an end-to-end RESPONSE 
    or an end-to-end NOTIFY message that includes a marked (i.e., PDR 
   <M> and/or PDR <S> parameters are set ON) "PDR_Reservation_Report" or
   "PDR_Congestion_Report" and/or an INFO_SPEC object. 

4.6.1.5.1.  Triggered by a RESERVE message
   
   This RMD explicit release procedure can be triggered by a tear (TEAR 
   flag set ON) end-to-end RESERVE message. When a tear (TEAR flag 
   set ON) end-to-end RESERVE message arrives to the QNE Ingress 
   then the QNE Ingress node SHOULD process the message in a standard 
   QoS-NSLP way (see [QoS-NSLP]). In addition to this, the RMD RMF
   is notified, as specified in [QoS-NSLP].  

   Same as for the scenario described in Section 4.6.1.1., a bypassing 
   procedure has to be initiated by the QNE Ingress node. The bypassing 
   procedure is performed according to the description given in Section 
   4.4. At the QNE Ingress the end-to-end RESERVE message is marked, 
   i.e., modifying the QoS-NSLP default NSLP-ID value to another NSLP-ID 
   predefined value that will be used by the GIST message that carries
   the end-to-end RESERVE message to bypass the QNE Interior nodes.

   Before generating an intra-domain tear RESERVE, the RMD-QOSM has to 
   release the requested RMD-QOSM bandwidth from the RMD traffic class 
   state maintained at the QNE Ingress. 

   This can be achieved by identifying the traffic class (PHB) and then 
   subtracting the amount of RMD traffic class requested resources, 
   included in the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" field of the local RMD-QSpec 
   <TMOD-1> parameter, from the total reserved amount of resources 
   stored in the RMD traffic class state. The <Time Lag> is used as 
   explained in the introductory part of Section 4.6.1.5.

   After that the REQUIRED bandwidth is released from the RMD-QOSM 
   traffic class state at the QNE Ingress, an intra-domain RESERVE (RMD-
   QOSM) message has to be generated. The intra-domain RESERVE (RMD-
   QSpec) message MUST include a "RMD QoS object combination" field and 
   a PHR container, (i.e., "PHR_Release_Request") and it MAY include a 
   PDR container, (i.e., PDR_Release_Request). An example of this 
   operation can be seen in Figure 11.

   Most of the non default values of the objects contained in the 
   tear intra-domain RESERVE message are set by the QNE Ingress node in 
   the same way as described in Section 4.6.1.1.  The following objects 
   are set differently (see QoS-NSLP-RMF API described in [QoS-NSLP]):

   *  The <RII> object MUST NOT be included in this message.  This is 
      because the QNE Ingress node does not need to receive a 
      response from the QNE Egress node;
   
   *  If the release procedure is not applied for the RMD modification 
      of aggregated reservation procedure, see Section 4.6.1.4, then 
      the TEAR flag MUST be set to ON;

   *  the PHR resource units MUST be included into the "Peak Data Rate-1 
      (p)" value of the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter of the RMD-
      QOSM <QoS Desired>;
   
   *  the value of the <Admitted Hops> parameter MUST be set to "1";  

   *  the value of the <Time Lag> parameter of the PHR container is 
      calculated by the RMD-QOSM functionality (see 4.6.1.5) the value 
      of the <Control Type> parameter of PHR container is set to "18" 
      (i.e., PHR_Release_Request).

   Any QNE Interior node that receives the combination of the RMD-
   QOSM <Qos Desired> object and the "PHR_Release_Request" control 
   information container  MUST identify the traffic class (PHB)
   and release the requested resources included in the "Peak Data Rate-1 
   (p)" value of the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter. This can be 
   achieved by subtracting the amount of RMD traffic class requested 
   resources, included in the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" field of the local 
   RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter, from the total reserved amount of 
   resources stored in the RMD traffic class state.  The value of the 
   <Time Lag> parameter of the "PHR_Release_Request" container is used 
   during the release procedure as explained in the introductory part of 
   Section 4.6.1.5.
   The intra-domain tear RESERVE (RMD-QSpec) message is received and 
   processed by the QNE Egress node.  The RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired>) and 
   the "PHR RMD-QOSM control" container (and if available the "PDR 
   Container") are read and processed by the RMD QoS node.

   The value of the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" field of the local RMD-QSpec 
   <TMOD-1> parameter of the RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired> and the value of the 
   <Time Lag> field of the PHR container MUST be used by the RMD release 
   procedure.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   This can be achieved by subtracting the amount of RMD 
   traffic class requested resources, included in the "Peak Data Rate-1 
   (p)" field value of the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter, from the 
   total reserved amount of resources stored in the RMD traffic class 
   state.
   
   The end-to-end RESERVE message is forwarded by the next hop (i.e., 
   the QNE Egress) only if the intra-domain tear RESERVE (RMD-QSpec) 
   message arrives at the QNE Egress node. Furthermore, the QNE Egress 
   MUST stop the marking process that was used to bypass the QNE 
   Interior nodes by reassigning the QoS-NSLP default NSLP-ID value to 
   the end-to-end RESERVE message, see Section 4.4.
   Note that when the QNE edges maintain aggregated QoS-NSLP reservation 
   states the RMD-QOSM functionality MAY start a RMD modification 
   procedures (see Section 4.6.1.4.) that uses the explicit release 
   procedure described above, in this subsection. Note that if the 
   complete bandwidth associated with the aggregated reservation 
   maintained at the QNE ingress has to be released then the TEAR flag 
   MUST be set to ON. Otherwise, the TEAR flag MUST be set to OFF, see 
   Section 4.6.1.4.


4.6.1.5.2   Triggered by a marked RESPONSE or NOTIFY message
   
   This RMD explicit release procedure can be triggered by either an 
   intra-domain RESPONSE message with a PDR container carrying among 
   others the <M> and <S> parameters with values <M>=1 and <S>=0 (see 
   Section 4.6.1.2) an intra-domain (refresh) RESPONSE message carrying 
   a PDR Container with <M>=1 and <S>=1  (see Section 4.6.1.6.1) or an 
   end to end NOTIFY message (see Section 4.6.1.6.) with an INFO_SPEC 
   object with the following values:

   Error Severity Class: Informational 
   Error Code value: Congestion situation 

   When the aggregated intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational states are used 
   then an end-to-end NOTIFY message used to trigger an RMD release 
   procedure MAY contain a PDR container that carries a <M> and a <S> 
   with values <M>=1 and <S>=1, and a bandwidth value in the <PDR 
   Bandwidth> parameter included in a "PDR_Refresh_Report" or 
   "PDR_Congestion_Report" container. 

   Note that in all explicit release procedures, before generating an 
   intra-domain tear RESERVE, the RMD-QOSM has to release the requested 
   RMD-QOSM bandwidth from the RMD traffic class state maintained at the 
   QNE Ingress. This can be achieved by identifying the traffic class 
   (PHB) and then subtracting the amount of RMD traffic class requested 
   resources, included in the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" field of the 
   local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter, from the total reserved amount of 
   resources stored in the RMD traffic class state.

   Figure 12 shows the situation that the intra-domain tear RESERVE is 
   generated after being triggered by either an intra-domain (refresh) 
   RESPONSE message that carries a PDR Container with <M>=1 and <S>=1, 
   or by an end-to-end NOTIFY message that do not carry a PDR container, 
   but an INFO_SPEC object. The error code values carried by this NOTIFY 
   message are:

   Error Severity Class: Informational 
   Error Code value: Congestion situation 

   Most of the non-default values of the objects contained in the 
   tear intra-domain RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) message are set by the QNE 
   Ingress node in the same way as described in Section 4.6.1.1.

   The following objects MUST be used and/or set differently (see 
   QoS-NSLP-RMF described in [QoS-NSLP]):

   *  The value of the <M> parameter of the PHR container MUST be set 
      to "1".

   *  the value of the <S> parameter of the 
      "PHR container" MUST be set to "1".  

   *  The RESERVE message MAY include a PDR container. Note that this 
      is needed if bi-directional scenario is used, see Section 4.6.2.

   triggered by NOTIFY used by the RMD-QOSM. 

   Note that if the values of the <M> and <S> parameters included in the 
   PHR container carried by a intra-domain tear RESERVE(RMD-QOSM) are 
   set as ((<M>=0 and <S>=1) or (<M>=0 and <S>=0) or (<M>=1 and <S>=1)) 
   then the <Max Admitted Hops> value SHOULD NOT be compared to the 
   <Admitted Hops> value and the value of the <K> field MUST NOT be set.
   Any QNE edge or QNE Interior node that receives the intra-domain tear 
   RESERVE it MUST check the <K> field included in the PHR Container. If 
   the <K> fied is "0" then the traffic class state (PHB) has to be 
   identified, using the <PHB Class> parameter, and the the requested 
   resources included in the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" field of the 
   local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter have to be released.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   This can be achieved by subtracting the amount of RMD traffic class 
   requested resources, included in the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" field of 
   the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter, from the total reserved 
   amount of resources stored in the RMD traffic class state.  The value 
   of the <Time Lag> parameter of the PHR field is used during the 
   release procedure as explained in the introductory part of Section 
   4.6.1.5. Afterwards, the QNE Egress node MUST terminate the tear 
   intra-domain RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) message.

   The RMD specific release procedure that is triggered by an 
   intra-domain RESPONSE message with <M>=1 and <S>=0 PDR container (see 
   Section 4.6.1.2) generates an intra-domain tear RESERVE message 
   that uses the combination of <Max Admitted Hops> and <Admitted_Hops> 
   fields to calculate and specify when the <K> value carried by the 
   "PHR Container" can be set. When the <K> field is set, then the "PHR 
   Container" and the RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired>  carried by an intra-domain 
   tear RESERVE MUST NOT be processed. 
   
   The RMD specific explicit release procedure that uses the combination 
   of <Max Admitted Hops>, <Admitted_Hops> and <K> fields to release 
   resources/bandwidth in only a part of the RMD domain, is denoted as 
   RMD partial release procedure.  

   This explicit release procedure can be used, for example, during 
   unsuccessful reservation (see Section 4.6.1.2). When the RMD-
   QoSM/QoS-NSLP signaling model functionality of a QNE Ingress node 
   receives a  PDR container with values <M>=1 and <S>=0, of type 
   "PDR_Reservation_Report", it MUST start an RMD partial release 
   procedure.  
   In this situation, after that the REQUIRED bandwidth is released from 
   the RMD-QOSM traffic class state at the QNE Ingress, an intra-domain 
   RESERVE (RMD-QOSM) message has to be generated. An example of this 
   operation can be seen in Figure 13.
   
   Most of the non-default values of the objects contained in the 
   tear intra-domain RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) message are set by the QNE 
   Ingress node in the same way as described in Section 4.6.1.1.

   The following objects MUST be used and/or set differently:   
   *  The value of the <M> parameter of the PHR container MUST be set 
      to "1".

   *  The RESERVE message MAY include a PDR container.
   
   * the value of the <Max Admitted Hops> carried by the "PHR 
     Container" MUST be set equal to the <Max Admitted Hops> value 
     carried by the "PDR Container" (with <M>=1 and <S.=0) carried by 
     the received intra-domain RESPONSE message that triggers the 
     release procedure.

   Any QNE edge or QNE Interior node that receives the intra-domain tear 
   RESERVE has to check the value of the <K> field in the "PHR 
   Container" before releasing the requested resources.

   Figure 13: Basic operation during RMD explicit release procedure 
   Triggered by RESPONSE used by the RMD-QOSM

   If the <K> field value is "0", any QNE edge or QNE Interior node that 
   receives the intra-domain tear RESERVE can release the resources by 
   subtracting the amount of RMD traffic class requested resources, 
   included in the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" field of the local RMD-QSpec 
   <TMOD-1> parameter, from the total reserved amount of resources 
   stored in the RMD traffic class state.  The value of the <Time Lag> 
   parameter of the PHR field is used during the release procedure as 
   explained in the introductory part of Section 4.6.1.5.
   Furthermore, the QNE MUST perform the following procedures.
   If the values of the <M> and <S> parameters included in the 
    "PHR_Release_Request" PHR container are (<M=1> and <S>=0) then the 
   <Max Admitted Hops> value MUST be compared with the calculated 
   <Admitted Hops> value.  Note that each time that the intra-domain 
   tear RESERVE is processed and before being forwarded by a QNE, the 
   <Admitted Hops> value included in the PHR container is increased by 
   one.  

   When these two values are equal then the intra-domain 
   RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) that is forwarded further towards the QNE Egress 
   MUST set the <K> value of the carried "PHR Container" to "1". 
   The reason of doing this is that the QNE node that is currently 
   processing this message was the last QNE node that successfully 
   processed the RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired>) and PHR container of its 
   associated initial reservation request (i.e., initial intra-domain 
   RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) message). Its next QNE downstream node was unable 
   to successfully process the initial reservation request, therefore, 
   this QNE node marked the <M> and <Hop_U> parameters of the 
   "PHR_Resource_Request".  

Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 56]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   Note that finally the QNE Egress node MUST terminate the intra-domain 
   RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) message.
   
   Morover, note that the above described RMD partial release procedure 
   applies to the situation that the QNE edges maintain a per flow QoS-
   NSLP reservation state. 

   When the QNE edges maintain aggregated intra-domain QoS-NSLP 
   operational states and a severe congestion occurs, then the QNE 
   Ingress MAY receive an end to end NOTIFY message (see Section 
   4.6.1.6.) with a PDR container that carries the  <M>=0 and <S>=1 
   fields and a bandwidth value in the <PDR Bandwidth> parameter 
   included in a "PDR_Congestion_Report" container. Furthermore the 
   same end-to-end NOTIFY message carries an INFO_SPEC object with the 
   following values:

   Error Severity Class: Informational 
   Error Code value: Congestion situation 

   The end-to-end session associated with this NOTIFY message maintains 
   the BOUND_SESSION_ID of the bound aggregated session, see Sections 
   4.3.1. The RMD-QOSM at QNE Ingress MUST start a RMD modification 
   procedures (see Section 4.6.1.4) that uses the RMD explicit release 
   procedure described above in this section. In particular, the RMD 
   explicit release procedure releases the bandwidth value included in 
   the <PDR Bandwidth> parameter, within the "PDR_Congestion_Report" 
   container, from the reserved bandwidth associated with the aggregated 
   intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational state.  

4.6.1.6. Severe congestion handling

   This section describes the operation of the RMD-QOSM when a severe 
   congestion occurs within the Diffserv domain.  

   When a failure in a communication path, e.g., a router or a link 
   failure occurs, the routing algorithms will adapt to failures by 
   changing the routing decisions to reflect changes in the topology and
   traffic volume.  As a result, the re-routed traffic will follow a new 
   path, which MAY result in overloaded nodes as they need to support 
   more traffic.  This MAY cause severe congestion in the communication 
   path.  In this situation the available resources, are not enough to 
   meet the REQUIRED QoS for all the flows along the new path.  
   Therefore, one or more flows SHOULD be terminated, or forwarded in a 
   lower priority queue.   

   Interior nodes notify edge nodes by data marking or marking the 
   refresh messages.

4.6.1.6.1 Severe congestion handling by the RMD-QOSM refresh procedure 

   This procedure applies to all RMD scenarios that use a RMD refresh 
   procedure. The QoS-NSLP and RMD are able to cope with congested 
   situations using the refresh procedure, see Section 4.6.1.3. 

Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 57]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   If the refresh is not successful in an QNE Interior node, edge nodes 
   are notified by setting <S>=1 (<M>=1) marking the refresh messages 
   and by setting the <O> field in the "PHR_Refresh_Update" container, 
   carried by the intra-domain RESERVE message.

   Note that the overload situation can be detected by using the example 
   given in appendix A.1.1. In this situation, when the given 
   signaled_overload_rate parameter given in appendix A.1.1 is higher 
   than 0 then the value of the <Overload> field is set to "1".
   The calculation of this is given in appendix A.1.1 and denoted 
   as the signaled_overload_rate parameter. The flows can be terminated 
   by the RMD release procedure described in Section 4.6.1.5.

   The intra-domain RESPONSE message that is sent by the QNE Egress 
   towards QNE Ingress will contain a PDR container with a Container ID 
   =26, i.e., "PDR_Congestion_Report". The values of the <M>, <S> and 
   <O> fields of this container SHOULD be set equal to the values of the 
   <M>, <S> and <O> fields, respectively, carried by the 
   "PHR_Refresh_Update" container. Part of the flows, corresponding to 
   the <O>, are terminated, or forwarded in a lower priority queue. 

   The flows can be terminated by the RMD release procedure described in 
   Section 4.6.1.5.  
   Furthermore, note that the above functionalities apply also for the 
   scenario where the QNE Edge nodes maintain either per flow QoS-NSLP 
   reservation states or aggregated QoS-NSLP reservation states.

   In general, relying on the soft state refresh mechanism solves the 
   congestion within the time frame of the refresh period. If this 
   mechanism is not fast enough additional functions SHOULD be used, 
   which are described in Section 4.6.1.6.2. 


4.6.1.6.2 Severe congestion handling by proportional data packet marking

   This severe congestion handling method requires the following 
   functionalities.

4.6.1.6.2.1 Operation in the Interior nodes

   The detection and marking/remarking functionality described in this 
   section applies to NSIS aware, but also to NSIS unaware nodes. This 
   means however, that the "not NSIS aware" nodes MUST be configured 
   such that they can detect the congestion/severe congestion situations 
   and remark packets in the same way as the "NSIS aware" nodes do.

   The Interior node detecting severe congestion remarks data packets 
   passing the node. For this remarking, two additional DSCPs can be 
   allocated for each traffic class.  One DSCP MAY be used to indicate 
   that the packet passed a congested node. This type of DSCP is denoted 
   in this document as "affected DSCP" and is used to indicate that a 
   packet passed through a severe congested node. 

Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 58]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   The use of this DSCP type eliminates the possibility that, due to 
   e.g. flow-based ECMP (Equal Cost Multiple Paths) enabled routing, the 
   egress node either does not detect packets passed a severe congested 
   node or erroneously detects packets that actually did not pass the 
   severe congested node.  Note that this type of DSCP MUST only be used 
   if all the nodes within the RMD domain are configured to use it. 
   Otherwise, this type of DSCP MUST NOT be applied. The other DSCP MUST 
   be used to indicate the degree of congestion by marking the bytes 
   proportionally to the degree of congestion. This type of DSCP is 
   denoted in this document as "encoded DSCP".

   Note that in this document the terms marked packets or marked bytes 
   refer to the "encoded DSCP". The terms unmarked packets or unmarked 
   bytes are representing the packets or the bytes belonging to these 
   packets that their DSCP is either the "affected DSCP" or the original 
   DSCP. Furthermore, in the algorithm described below it is considered 
   that the router MAY drop received packets. The counting/measuring of 
   marked or unmarked bytes described in this section is accomplished 
   within measurement periods. All nodes within a RMD domain use the 
   same, fixed measurement interval, say T seconds, which MUST be 
   pre-configured.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the total number of additional (local and 
   experimental) DSCPs needed for severe congestion handling within an 
   RMD domain SHOULD be as low as possible and it SHOULD NOT exceed the 
   limit of 8. One possibility to reduce the number of used DSCPs is to 
   use only the "encoded DSCP" and not to use "affected DSCP" marking. 
   Another possible solution is for example, to allocate one DSCP for 
   severe congestion indication for each of the AF classes that can be  
   supported by RMD-QOSM. 

   An example of a remarking procedure can be found in Appendix A.1.1.


4.6.1.6.2.2 Operation in the Egress nodes

   When the QNE edges maintain a per flow intra-domain QoS-NSLP   
   operational state, see sections 4.3.2, 4.3.3, then the following 
   procedure is followed. The QNE Egress node applies a predefined 
   policy to solve the severe congestion situation, by selecting a 
   number of inter-domain (end-to-end) flows that SHOULD be terminated, 
   or forwarded in a lower priority queue. 
 
   When the RMD domain does not use the "affected DSCP" 
   marking then the egress MUST generate an ingress/egress pair 
   aggregated state, for each ingress and for each supported PHB. This 
   is because the edges MUST be able to detect in which ingress/egress 
   pair a severe congestion occurs. This is because otherwise the QNE 
   Egress will not have any information on which flows or groups of 
   flows were affected by the severe congestion. 



Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 59]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   When the RMD domain supports the "affected DSCP" marking then the 
   egress is able to detect all flows that are affected by the severe 
   congestion situation. Therefore, when the RMD domain supports the 
   "affected DSCP" marking, then the Egress MAY not generate and 
   maintain the ingress/egress pair aggregated reservation States. Note 
   that these aggregated reservation states MAY not be associated with 
   aggregated intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational states.

   The ingress/egress pair aggregated reservation state can be derived 
   by detecting, which flows are using the same PHB and are sent by the 
   same Ingress (via the per flow end-to-end QoS-NSLP states). 

   Some flows, belonging to the same PHB traffic class might get
   other priority than other flows belonging to the same PHB traffic 
   class. This difference in priority can be notified to the egress and 
   ingress nodes either by the RESERVE message that carries the QSpec  
   associated with the end-to-end QoS model, e.g.,, <Preemption 
   Priority> & <Defending Priority> parameter, or by using a local 
   defined policy. The priority value is kept in the reservation states, 
   see Section 4.3, which might be used during admission control and/or 
   severe congestion handling procedures. The terminated flows are 
   selected from the flows having the same PHB traffic class as the PHB 
   of the marked (as "encoded DSCP") and "affected DSCP" (when applied 
   in the complete RMD domain) packets and (when the ingress/egress pair 
   aggregated states are available) that are belonging to the same 
   ingress/egress pair aggregate.

   For flows associated with the same PHB traffic class the priority of 
   the flow plays a significant role. An example of calculating the 
   number of flows associated with each priority class that have to be 
   terminated is explained in Appendix A.1.2.

   For the flows (sessions) that have to be terminated, the QNE Egress  
   node generates and sends an end-to-end NOTIFY message to the QNE 
   Ingress node (its upstream stateful QoS-NSLP peer) to indicate the 
   severe congestion in the communication path.

   The non-default values of the objects contained in the NOTIFY 
   message MUST be set by the QNE Egress node as follows 
   (see QoS-NSLP-RMF API described in [QoS-NSLP]):
   
   *  the values of the <INFO_SPEC> object is set by the standard 
      QoS-NSLP protocol functions.

   * the INFO_SPEC object MUST include information that notifies that 
     the end-to-end flow MUST be terminated. This information is as 
     follows: 

     Error Severity Class: Informational  
     Error Code value: Congestion situation

   When the QNE edges maintain a per aggregate intra-domain QoS-NSLP 
   operational state, see sections 4.3.1 then the QNE Edge has to 
   calculate, per each aggregate intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational 
   state, the total bandwidth that has to be terminated in order to 
   solve the severe congestion. The total to be released bandwidth is 
   calculated in the same way as in the situation that the QNE edges 
   maintain per flow intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational states. 
   Note that for the aggregated sessions that are affected, the QNE  
   Egress node generates and sends one end-to-end NOTIFY message to the 
   QNE Ingress node(its upstream stateful QoS-NSLP peer) to indicate the 
   severe congestion in the communication path. Note that this end-to-
   end NOTIFY message is associated with one of the end-to-end sessions 
   that is bound to the aggregated intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational 
   state. 

   The non-default values of the objects contained in the NOTIFY 
   message MUST be set by the QNE Egress node in the same way as the 
   ones used by the end-to-end NOTIFY message described above for the 
   situation that the QNE Egress maintains a per flow intra-domain 
   operational state. In addition to this the end-to-end NOTIFY MUST 
   carry the RMD-Qspec, which contains a PDR container with a 
   Container ID =26, i.e., "PDR_Congestion_Report". The 
   value of the <S> SHOULD be set. Furthermore, the value of the <PDR 
   Bandwidth> parameter MUST contain the bandwidth, associated with the 
   aggregated QoS-NSLP operational state, which has to be released. 

   Furthermore, the number of end-to-end sessions that have to be 
   terminated will be calculated as in the situation that the QNE edges 
   maintain per flow intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational states. Similarly 
   for each, to be terminated, ongoing flow the egress will notify the 
   ingress in the same way as in the situation that the QNE edges 
   maintain per flow intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational states. 

   Note that QNE egress SHOULD restore the original DSCP 
   values of the remarked packets, otherwise multiple actions for the 
   same event might occur. However, this value MAY be left in its 
   remarking form if there is an SLA agreement between domains that a 
   downstream domain handles the remarking problem. 

   An example of a detailed severe congestion operation in the Egress 
   Nodes can be found in Appendix A.1.2.


   4.6.1.6.2.3 Operation in the Ingress nodes

   Upon receiving the (end-to-end) NOTIFY message, the QNE Ingress node
   resolves the severe congestion by a predefined policy, e.g., by 
   refusing new incoming flows (sessions), terminating the affected and 
   notified flows (sessions), and blocking their packets or shifting 
   them to an alternative RMD traffic class (PHB). 


Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 61]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   This operation is depicted in Figure 14, where the QNE Ingress, for 
   each flow (session) to be terminated, receives a NOTIFY message that 
   carries the "Congestion situation" error code.  

   When the QNE Ingress node receives the end-to-end NOTIFY message, it 
   associates this NOTIFY message with its bound intra-domain session, 
   see Sections 4.3.2, 4.3.3. via the BOUND_SESSION_ID information 
   included in the end-to-end per-flow QoS-NSLP state. The QNE Ingress 
   uses the operation described in Section 4.6.1.5.2 to terminate the 
   intra-domain session.

   Figure 14:  RMD severe congestion handling


   Note that the above functionality applies to the RMD reservation-
   Based, see Section 4.3.3 and to both measurement-based admission  
   control methods (i.e., congestion notification based on probing and 
   the NSIS measurement-based admission control), see Section 4.3.2. 

   In the case that the QNE edges support aggregated intra-domain QoS-
   NSLP operational states the following actions take place. The QNE 
   Ingress MAY receive an end to end NOTIFY message with a PDR container 
   that carries a <S> marked and a bandwidth value in the <PDR 
   Bandwidth> parameter included in a "PDR_Congestion_Report" container. 
   Furthermore the same end-to-end NOTIFY message carries an INFO_SPEC 
   object with the "Congestion situation" error code. 

   When the QNE Ingress node receives this end-to-end  NOTIFY message, 
   it associates the NOTIFY message with the aggregated intra-domain 
   QoS-NSLP operational state via the BOUND_SESSION_ID information 
   included in the end-to-end per-flow QoS-NSLP operational state, see 
   Section 4.3.1. 



Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 62]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   The RMD-QOSM at the QNE Ingress node by using the 
   total to be released bandwidth value included in the <PDR Bandwidth> 
   parameter MUST reduce the bandwidth associated and reserved by the 
   RMD aggregated session. This is accomplished by triggering the RMD 
   modification for Aggregated reservations procedure described in 
   Section 4.6.1.4. 

   In addition to the above, the QNE Ingress MUST select a number of 
   inter-domain (end-to-end) flows (sessions) that MUST be terminated. 
   This is accomplished in the same way as in the situation that the QNE 
   edges maintain per flow intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational states.

   The terminated end-to-end sessions are selected from the end-to-end 
   sessions bound to the aggregated intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational 
   state. Note that the end-to-end session associated with the received 
   end-to-end NOTIFY message that notified the severe congestion MUST 
   also be selected for termination.   
   For the flows (sessions) that have to be terminated, the QNE Ingress  
   node generates and sends an end-to-end NOTIFY message upstream 
   towards the sender (QNI). The values carried by this message are:
 
   *  the values of the <INFO_SPEC> object is set by the standard 
      QoS-NSLP protocol functions.

   * the INFO_SPEC object MUST include information that notifies that 
     the end-to-end flow MUST be terminated. This information is as 
     follows: 

     Error Severity Class: Informational  
     Error Code value: Congestion situation


4.6.1.7 Admission control using congestion notification based on probing 

   The congestion notification function based on probing can be used to 
   implement a simple measurement-based admission control within a 
   Diffserv domain.  At interior nodes along the data path congestion 
   notification thresholds are set in the measurement based admission
   control function for the traffic belonging to different PHBs. These 
   interior nodes are not NSIS aware nodes.


4.6.1.7.1 Operation in Ingress nodes

   When an end-to-end reservation request (RESERVE) arrives at the 
   Ingress node (QNE), see Figure 15, it is processed based on the 
   procedures defined by the end-to-end QoS model.  





Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 63]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM
 

   The DSCP field of the GIST datagram message that is used to transport 
   this probe RESERVE message, SHOULD be marked with the same value of 
   DSCP as the data path packets associated with the same session. In 
   this way it is ensured that the end-to-end RESERVE (probe) packet 
   passed through the node that it is congested. This feature is very 
   useful when ECMP based routing is used to detect only flows that are 
   passing through the congested router.

   When (end-to-end) RESPONSE message is received by the Ingress node,it 
   will be processed based on the procedures defined by the end-to-end 
   QoS model. 


4.6.1.7.2 Operation in Interior nodes

   These Interior nodes are not needed to be NSIS aware nodes and they 
   do not need to process NSIS functionality of NSIS messages. Note that 
   the "not NSIS aware" nodes MUST be configured such that they can 
   detect the congestion/severe congestion situations and remark packets 
   in the same way as the "NSIS aware" nodes do.

   Using standard functionalities congestion notification thresholds are 
   set for the traffic belonging to different PHBs, see Section 4.3.2. 
   The end-to-end RESERVE message, see Figure 15, is used as a probe 
   packet. 
  
   The DSCP field of all data packets and of the GIST message carrying 
   the RESERVE message will be re-marked when the corresponding 
   "congestion notification" threshold is exceeded, see Section 4.3.2. 
   Note that when the data rate is higher than the congestion 
   notification threshold then also the data packets are remarked. An 
   example of the detailed operation of this procedure is given in 
   Appendix A.2.1.


4.6.1.7.3 Operation in Egress nodes

   As emphasised in Section 4.6.1.6.2.2, the egress node, by using the 
   per flow end-to-end QoS-NSLP states, can derive which flows are using 
   the same PHB and are sent by the same ingress. 

   For each ingress, the egress SHOULD generate an ingress/egress pair 
   aggregated (RMF) reservation state for each supported PHB. Note that 
   this aggregated reservation state does not require that also an 
   aggregated intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational state is needed. 

   In Appendix A.2.2 an example is described how and when a (probe) 
   RESERVE message that arrives at the egress, is admitted or rejected. 





Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 64]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   If the request is rejected then the Egress node SHOULD 
   generate an (end-to-end) RESPONSE message to notify that the 
   reservation is unsuccesfull. In particular it will generate an 
   INFO_SPEC object of: 
     Error Severity Class: Transient Failure
     Error Code value: Reservation failure

   The QSpec that was carried by the end to end RESERVE belonging to 
   the same session as this end to end RESPONSE is included in this 
   message. The parameters included in the QSpec <QoS Reserved> object 
   are copied from the original <QoS Desired> values. The "E" flag 
   associated with the <QoS Reserved> object and the "E" flag associated 
   with local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter are also set. This RESPONSE 
   message will be sent to the Ingress node and it will be processed 
   based on the end-to-end QoS model. 

   Note that QNE egress SHOULD restore the original DSCP values of the  
   remarked packets, otherwise multiple actions for the same event might
   occur. However, this value MAY be left in its remarking form if there
   is an SLA agreement between domains that a downstream domain handles
   the remarking problem. Note that the break "B" flag carried by the 
   end-to-end RESERVE message MUST NOT be set.

4.6.2  Bi-directional operation

   This section describes the basic bidirectional operation and 
   sequence of events/triggers of the RMD-QOSM.  The following basic 
   operation cases are distinguished: 

     * Successful and unsuccessful reservation (Section 4.6.2.1);
     * Refresh reservation (Section 4.6.2.2);
     * Modification of aggregated reservation (Section 4.6.2.3);
     * Release procedure (Section 4.6.2.4);
     * Severe congestion handling (Section 4.6.2.5);
     * Admission control using congestion notification based on probing   
      (Section 4.6.2.6).

   It is important to emphasize that the content of this section is used 
   for the specification of the following RMD-QOSM/QoS-NSLP signaling 
   schemes, when basic unidirectional operation is assumed:

    * "per flow congestion notification based on probing";

    * "per flow RMD NSIS measurement based admission control",

    * "per flow RMD reservation based" in combination with "severe 
     congestion handling by the RMD-QOSM refresh procedure" 

    * "per flow RMD reservation based" in combination with "severe 
     congestion handling by proportional data packet marking" 

    * "per aggregate RMD reservation based" in combination with 
      "severe congestion handling by the RMD-QOSM refresh procedure" 

    * "per aggregate RMD reservation based" in combination with 
      "severe congestion handling by proportional data packet marking"

   For more details, please see Section 3.2.3.

   In particular, the described functionality described in Sections 
   4.6.2.1, 4.6.2.2, 4.6.2.3, 4.6.2.4, 4.6.2.5 applies to the RMD 
   reservation-based and to the NSIS measurement-based admission control 
   methods. The described functionality in Section 4.6.2.6 applies to 
   the admission control procedure that uses the congestion notification 
   based on probing. The QNE Edge nodes maintain either per flow QoS-
   NSLP operational and reservation states or aggregated QoS-NSLP 
   operational and reservation states.

   RMD-QOSM assumes that asymmetric routing MAY be applied in the RMD 
   domain.  Combined sender-receiver initiated reservation cannot be 
   efficiently done in the RMD domain because upstream NTLP states are 
   not stored in Interior routers.  




Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 66]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   Therefore, the bi-directional operation SHOULD be performed by two 
   sender-initiated reservations (sender&sender).  We assume that the 
   QNE edge nodes are common for both upstream and downstream 
   directions, therefore, the two reservations/sessions can be bound at 
   the QNE edge nodes. Note that if this is not the case then the bi-
   directional procedure could be managed and maintained by nodes 
   located outside the RMD domain, by using other procedures than the 
   ones defined in RMD-QOSM.
   
   This (intra-domain) bi-directional sender&sender procedure can then 
   be applied between the QNE edges (QNE Ingress and QNE Egress) nodes 
   of the RMD QoS signaling model.  In the situation a security 
   association exists between the QNE Ingress and QNE Egress nodes (see 
   Figure 15), and the QNE Ingress node has the REQUIRED "Peak Data 
   Rate-1 (p)" values of the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameters for 
   both directions, i.e., QNE Ingress towards QNE Egress and QNE Egress 
   towards QNE Ingress, then the QNE Ingress MAY include both "Peak Data 
   Rate-1 (p)" values of the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameters (needed  
   for both directions) into the RMD-QSpec within a RESERVE message.  In 
   this way the QNE Egress node is able to use the QoS parameters needed 
   for the "Egress towards Ingress" direction (QoS-2).  The QNE Egress 
   is then able to create a RESERVE with the right QoS parameters 
   included in the QSpec, i.e., RESERVE (QoS-2). Both directions of the 
   flows are bound by inserting <BOUND_SESSION_ID> objects at the QNE 
   Ingress and QNE Egress, which will be carried by bound end-to-end 
   RESERVE messages.

   Note that it is RECOMMENDED that the QNE implementations of RMD-QOSM 
   process the QoS-NSLP signaling messages with a higher priority than 
   data packets. This can be accomplished as described in Section 3.3.4 
   in [QoS-NSLP] and the QoS-NSLP-RMF API [QoS-NSLP].

   A bidirectional reservation, within the RMD domain, is indicated by 
   the PHR <B> and PDR <B> flags, which are set in all messages. In this 
   case two BOUND_SESSION_ID objects SHOULD be used. 

   When the QNE edges maintain per-flow intra-domain QoS-NSLP 
   operational states then the end-to-end RESERVE message carries two 
   BOUND_SESSION_IDs. One BOUND_SESSION_ID carries the SESSION_ID of the 
   tunneled intra-domain (per-flow) session that is using a BINDING_CODE 
   with value set to code (Tunneled and end-to-end sessions).  Another 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID carries the SESSION_ID of the bound bidirectional 
   end-to-end session. The BINDING_CODE associated with this 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID is set to code (Bi-directional sessions).

   When the QNE edges maintain aggregated intra-domain QoS-NSLP 
   operational states then the end-to-end RESERVE message carries two 
   BOUND_SESSION_IDs. One BOUND_SESSION_ID carries the SESSION_ID of the 
   tunneled aggregated intra-domain session that is using a BINDING_CODE 
   with value set to code (Aggregated sessions).  Another 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID carries the SESSION_ID of the bound bidirectional 
   end-to-end session. The BINDING_CODE associated with this 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID is set to code (Bi-directional sessions).
   

   The intra-domain and end-to-end QoS-NSLP operational states are 
   initiated/modified depending on the binding type, see Section 4.3.1, 
   4.3.2, 4.3.3. 

   If no security association exists between the QNE Ingress and QNE 
   Egress nodes the bi-directional reservation for the sender&sender 
   scenario in the RMD domain SHOULD use the scenario specified in 
   [QoS-NSLP] as "Bi-directional reservation for sender&sender 
   scenario". This is because in this scenario the RESERVE message sent
   from QNE Ingress to QNE Egress does not have to carry the QoS 
   parameters needed for the "Egress towards Ingress" direction (QoS-2).

   In the following sections it is considered that the QNE 
   edge nodes are common for both upstream and downstream directions 
   and therefore, the two reservations/sessions can be bound at the 
   QNE edge nodes.  Furthermore, it is considered that a security 
   association exists between the QNE Ingress and QNE Egress nodes, 
   and the QNE Ingress node has the REQUIRED "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" 
   value of the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameters for both directions, 
   i.e., QNE Ingress towards QNE Egress and QNE Egress towards QNE 
   Ingress.

   According to Section 3.2.3 it is specified that only the "per flow 
   RMD reservation based" in combination with "severe congestion 
   handling by proportional data packet marking" scheme MUST be 
   implemented within one RMD domain. However, all RMD QNEs supporting 
   this specification MUST support the combination the "per flow RMD 
   reservation based" in combination with "severe congestion handling by 
   proportional data packet marking" scheme. If the RMD QNEs support 
   more RMD-QOSM schemes then the operator of that RMD domain MUST pre-
   configure all the QNE edge nodes within one domain such that the 
   <SCH> field included in the "PHR container", see Section 4.1.2 and 
   the "PDR Container", see Section 4.1.3, will use always the same 
   value, such that within one RMD domain only one of the below 
   described RMD-QOSM schemes is used at a time.

   All QNE nodes located within the RMD domain, MUST read and 
   interpret the <SCH> field included in the "PHR container" before 
   processing all the other "PHR container" payload fields. 
   Moreover, all QNE edge nodes located at the boarder of the RMD 
   domain, MUST read and interpret the <SCH> field included in the "PDR 
   container" before processing all the other "PDR container" payload 
   fields.


4.6.2.1 Successful and unsuccessful reservations 
   
   This section describes the operation of the RMD-QOSM where a RMD 
   Intra-domain bi-directional reservation operation, see Figure 16 and 
   Section 4.6.2, is either successfully or unsuccessfully accomplished.

   The bi-directional successful reservation is similar to a 
   combination of two unidirectional successful reservations that are 
   accomplished in opposite directions, see Figure 17. The main 
   differences of the bi-directional successful reservation procedure 
   with the combination of two unidirectional successful reservations 
   accomplished in opposite directions are as follows. Note also that 
   the intra-domain and end-to-end QoS-NSLP operational states generated 
   and maintained by the end-to-end RESERVE messages contain, compared 
   to the unidirectional reservation scenario, a different 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID data structure, see Section 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3.  
   In this scenario the intra-domain RESERVE message sent by the QNE 
   Ingress node towards the QNE Egress node, is denoted in Figure 17 as 
   RESERVE (RMD-QSpec): "forward".  The main differences between the 
   intra-domain RESERVE (RMD-QSpec):"forward" message used for the bi-
   directional successful reservation procedure and a RESERVE (RMD-
   QSpec) message used for the unidirectional successful reservation are 
   as follows (see QoS-NSLP-RMF API described in [QoS-NSLP]):  
   
   *  the RII object MUST NOT be included in the message. This is 
      because no RESPONSE message is REQUIRED. 

   *  the <B> bit of the PHR container indicates a bi-directional 
      reservation and it MUST be set to "1".

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   *  the PDR container is also included into the RESERVE(RMD-QSpec): 
      "forward" message. The value of the Container ID is 
      "20", i.e., "PDR_Reservation_Request".  Note that the response 
      PDR container sent by a QNE Egress to a QNE Ingress node is not 
      carried by an end-to-end RESPONSE message, but it is carried by an 
      intra-domain RESERVE message that is sent by the QNE Egress node 
      towards the QNE Ingress node (denoted in Figure 16 as 
      RESERVE(RMD-QSpec):"reverse").
   
   *  the <B> PDR bit indicates a bi-directional reservation and is set 
      to "1".
   
   *  the <PDR Bandwidth> field specifies the 
      requested bandwidth that has to be used by the QNE Egress node to 
      initiate another intra-domain RESERVE message in the reverse 
      direction.  

   The RESERVE(RMD-QSpec):"reverse" message is initiated by the QNE 
   Egress node at the moment that the RESERVE(RMD-QSpec):"forward" 
   message is successfully processed by the QNE Egress node.  

   The main differences between the RESERVE(RMD-QSpec):"reverse" 
   message used for the bi-directional successful reservation procedure
   and a RESERVE(RMD-QSpec) message used for the unidirectional 
   successful reservation are as follows:

   Figure 18 and Figure 19 show the flow diagrams used in case of a 
   unsuccessful bi-directional reservation.  In Figure 18 it 
   is considered that the QNE that is not able to support the 
   requested "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" value of local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1>  
   is located in the direction QNE Ingress towards QNE Egress.  In 
   Figure 19 it is considered that the QNE that is not able to support 
   the requested "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" value of local RMD-QSpec 
   <TMOD-1>  is located in the direction QNE Egress towards QNE Ingress.
   The main differences between the bi-directional unsuccessful 
   procedure shown in Figure 18 and the bi-directional successful 
   procedure are as follows:  
   *  the QNE node that is not able to reserve resources for a 
      certain request is located in the "forward" path, i.e., path 
      from QNE Ingress towards the QNE Egress.

   *  the QNE node that is not able to support the requested "Peak Data 
      Rate-1 (p)" value of local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> it MUST mark the <M>

      "PHR_Release_Request" and a "PDR_Release_Request" control 
      information.  This message is sent to QNE Egress node.  
      The QNE Egress node uses the information contained in the

      info containers to generate a RESERVE(RMD-QSpec):"reverse - T 
      tear" message that is sent towards the QNE Ingress node.

4.6.2.2 Refresh reservations 
   
   This section describes the operation of the RMD-QOSM where a RMD 
   intra-domain bi-directional refresh reservation operation is 
   accomplished.  
   The refresh procedure in case of RMD reservation-based method 
   follows a similar scheme as the successful reservation procedure, 
   described in Section 4.6.2.1, and depicted in Figure 17 and the
   way of how the refresh process of the reserved resources is 
   maintained, is similar to the refresh process used for the intra-
   domain uni-directional reservations (see Section 4.6.1.3). 
 
   Note that the RMD traffic class refresh periods used by the bound bi-
   directional sessions MUST be equal in all QNE edge and QNE Interior 
   nodes.

   The main differences between the RESERVE(RMD-QSpec):"forward" 
   message used for the bi-directional refresh procedure 
   and a RESERVE(RMD-QSpec):"forward" message used for the bi-
   directional successful reservation procedure are as follows:  

   *  the value of the Container ID of the PHR container is 
      "19", i.e., "PHR_Refresh_Update".
   
   *  the value of the Container ID of the PDR container is 
      "21", i.e., "PDR_Refresh_Request".

   The main differences between the RESERVE(RMD-QSpec):"reverse" 
   message used for the bi-directional refresh procedure and the RESERVE
   (RMD-QSpec): "reverse" message used for the bi-directional successful
   reservation procedure are as follows:
   
   *  the value of the Container ID of the PHR container is 
      "19", i.e., "PHR_Refresh_Update".
   
   *  the value of the Container ID of the PDR container is 
      "24", i.e., "PDR_Refresh_Report".

4.6.2.3 Modification of aggregated intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational 
reservation states 
   
   This section describes the operation of the RMD-QOSM where RMD 
   intra-domain bi-directional QoS-NSLP aggregated reservation states 
   have to be modified.  
   In the case when the QNE edges maintain, for the RMD QoS model, 
   QoS-NSLP aggregated reservation states and if such an aggregated 
   reservation has to be modified (see Section 4.3.1) then similar 
   procedures to Section 4.6.1.4. are applied. In particular: 

   * When the modification request requires an increase of the reserved 
   resources, the QNE Ingress node MUST include the corresponding value 
   into the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" field local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1>  
   parameter of the RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired>), which is sent together with 
   a "PHR_Resource_Request" control information. If a QNE edge or QNE 
   Interior node is not able to reserve the number of requested 
   resources, then the "PHR_Resource_Request" associated with the 
   local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter MUST be marked.  In this situation 
   the RMD specific operation for unsuccessful reservation will be 
   applied (see Section 4.6.2.1). Note that the value of the 
   <PDR Bandwidth> parameter, which is sent within a 
   "PDR_Reservation_Request" container, represents the increase of the 
   reserved resources in the "reverse" direction.

   * When the modification request requires a decrease of the 
   reserved resources, the QNE Ingress node MUST include this value 
   into the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" field of the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1>  
   parameter of the RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired>). Subsequently an RMD release 
   procedure SHOULD be accomplished (see Section 4.6.2.4). Note that the 
   value of the <PDR Bandwidth> parameter, which is sent within a 
   "PDR_Release_Request" container, represents the decrease of the 
   reserved resources in the "reverse" direction.

4.6.2.4 Release procedure 
   
   This section describes the operation of the RMD-QOSM where a RMD 
   intra-domain bi-directional reservation release operation is 
   accomplished. The message sequence diagram used in this procedure is 
   similar to the one used by the successful reservation procedures, 
   described in Section 4.6.2.1, and depicted in Figure 17. However, the 
   way of how the release of the reservation is accomplished, is similar 
   to the RMD release procedure used for the intra-domain uni-
   directional reservations (see Section 4.6.1.5 and Figure 18 and 
   Figure 19). 

   The main differences between the RESERVE (RMD-QSpec): 
   "forward" message used for the bi-directional release procedure 
   and a RESERVE (RMD-QSpec): "forward" message used for the bi-
   directional successful reservation procedure are as follows:  

   *  the value of the Container ID of the PHR container is 
      "18", i.e."PHR_Release_Request";

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM
   
   *  the value of the Container ID of the PDR container is 
      "22", i.e., "PDR_Release_Request";

   The main differences between the RESERVE (RMD-QSpec): "reverse" 
   message used for the bi-directional release procedure and the RESERVE 
   (RMD-QSpec): "reverse" message used for the bi-directional successful 
   reservation procedure are as follows:

   *  the value of the Container ID of the PHR container is 
      "18", i.e., "PHR_Release_Request";
  
   *  the PDR container is not included in the RESERVE (RMD-QSpec): 
      "reverse" message.

4.6.2.5 Severe congestion handling 

   This section describes the severe congestion handling operation used 
   in combination with RMD intra-domain bi-directional reservation 
   procedures. This severe congestion handling operation is similar to 
   the one described in Section 4.6.1.6. 

4.6.2.5.1 Severe congestion handling by the RMD-QOSM bi-directional 
          refresh procedure 

   This procedure is similar to the severe congestion handling procedure
   described in Section 4.6.1.6.1. The difference is related to how the 
   refresh procedure is accomplished, see Section 4.6.2.2 and to how the
   flows are terminated, see Section 4.6.2.4.

4.6.2.5.2 Severe congestion handling by proportional data packet marking

   This section describes the severe congestion handling by proportional
   data packet marking when this is combined with a RMD intra-domain 
   bi-directional reservation procedure. Note that the detection and 
   marking/remarking functionality described in this section and used by 
   Interior nodes, applies to NSIS aware, but also to NSIS unaware 
   nodes. This means however, that the "not NSIS aware" Interior nodes 
   MUST be configured such that they can detect the congestion 
   situations and remark packets in the same way as the Interior "NSIS 
   aware" nodes do.

   This procedure is similar to the severe congestion handling procedure
   described in Section 4.6.1.6.2. The main difference is related to the
   location of the severe congested node, i.e. "forward" or "reverse" 
   path. Note that when a severe congestion situation occurs on 
   e.g. on a forward path, and flows are terminated to solve the severe 
   congestion in forward path, then the reserved bandwidth associated 
   with the terminated bidirectional flows will also be released. 
   Therefore, a careful selection of the flows that have to be 
   terminated SHOULD take place. An example of such a selection is 
   given in Appendix A.3.1.



Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 75]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   Furthermore, a special case of this operation is associated to the 
   severe congestion situation occurring simultaneously on the forward 
   and reverse paths. An example of this operation is given in Appendix 
   A.3.2.
   Simulation results associated with these procedures can be found in 
   [DiKa08].

Figure 20: Intra-domain RMD severe congestion handling for 
           bi-directional reservation (congestion on path QNE(Ingress)
           towards QNE(Egress))

   Figure 20 shows the scenario where the severe congested node is 
   located in the "forward" path. The QNE Egress node has to generate an 
   end-to-end NOTIFY(PDR) message. In this way the QNE Ingress will be 
   able to receive the (#marked and #unmarked) that were measured by the 
   QNE Egress node on the congested "forward path". Note that in this 
   situation it is assumed that the "reverse path" is not congested. 
   This scenario is very similar to the 
   severe congestion handling scenario described in Section 4.6.1.6.2 
   and shown in Figure 14. The difference is related to the release 
   procedure, which is accomplished in the same way as described in 
   Section 4.6.2.4. 

   Figure 21 shows the scenario where the severe congested node is 
   located in the "reverse" path. Note that in this situation it is 
   assumed that the "forward path" is not congested. The main difference 
   between this scenario and the scenario shown in Figure 20 is that no 
   end-to-end NOTIFY(PDR) message has to be generated by the QNE Egress
   node. 

Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 76]

   This is because now the severe congestion occurs on the "reverse 
   path" and the QNE Ingress node receives the (#marked and #unmarked) 
   user data passing through the severely congested "reverse path". The 
   QNE Ingress node will be able to calculate the number of flows that 
   have to be terminated or forwarded in a lower priority queue.

4.6.2.6 Admission control using congestion notification based on  
          probing 

   This section describes the admission control scheme that uses the 
   congestion notification function based on probing when RMD 
   intra-domain bi-directional reservations are supported.

   Figure 22: Intra-domain RMD congestion notification based on probing 
              for bi-directional admission control (congestion on path 
              from QNE(Ingress) towards QNE(Egress))

   This procedure is similar to the congestion notification for 
   admission control procedure described in Section 4.6.1.7. The main 
   difference is related to the location of the severe congested node, 
   i.e., "forward" path (i.e., path between QNE Ingress towards QNE 
   Egress) or "reverse" path (i.e., path between QNE Egress towards 
   QNE Ingress).

   Figure 22 shows the scenario where the severe congested node is 
   located in the "forward" path. The functionality of providing 
   admission control is the same as the one described in Section 
   4.6.1.7, Figure 15.

   Figure 23 shows the scenario where the congested node is located in 
   the "reverse" path. The probe RESERVE message sent in the "forward" 
   direction will not be affected by the severe congested node, while 
   the DSCP value in the IP header of any packet of the "reverse" 
   direction flow and also of the GIST message that carries the 
   probe RESERVE message sent in the "reverse" direction will be 
   remarked by the congested node. The QNE ingress is in this way 
   notified that a congestion occurred in the network and therefore it 
   is able to refuse the new initiation of the reservation.

   Note that the "not NSIS aware" Interior nodes MUST be configured 
   such that they can detect the congestion/severe congestion 
   situations and remark packets in the same way as the Interior 
   "NSIS aware" nodes do.

4.7 Handling of additional errors

   During the QSpec processing, additional errors MAY occur. The way 
   in which these additional errors are handled and notified is 
   specified in [QSP-T] and [QoS-NSLP].


5.  Security Considerations
   
   A router implementing a QoS signaling protocol can, similar to a 
   router without QoS signaling, do a lot of harm to a system. If taken 
   over by an adversary, a router can delay, drop, inject, duplicate or 
   modify packets. Additional threats are, however, introduced with new 
   protocols and they are subject for a discussion below.

   The RMD-QOSM aims to be very lightweight signaling with regard to 
   the number of signaling message roundtrips and the amount of state 
   established at involved signaling nodes with and without reduced 
   state on QNEs. The actions allowed by a QNE Interior node are minimal 
   (i.e., only those specified by the RMD-QOSM).

   For example, only the QNE Ingress and the QNE Egress nodes are 
   allowed to initiate certain signaling messages. Moroever, RMD 
   signaling is targeted towards intra-domain signaling only. Therefore, 
   RMD-QOSM relies on the security support that is provided by the 
   bounded end-to-end session, which is running between the boundaries 
   of the RMD domain (i.e., the RMD-QOSM QNE edges). This implies the 
   usage of the Datagram Mode. 

   The security considerations described in this section apply to all 
   the supported RMD-QOSM/QoS-NSLP signalling schemes, see Section 
   3.2.3.

                 Figure 24: RMD message exchange

   In the context of RMD-QOSM signaling a classification between 
   on-path adversaries and off-path adversaries needs to be made. 
   Furthermore, it might be necessary to differentiate between off-path 
   nodes that never participate in the RMD signaling exchange and nodes 

   that are only off-path with regard to a specific signaling session 
   whereby routing asymmetry might even mean that the downstream and the
   upstream signaling direction matters for this classification.

   Note that RMD always uses the message exchange shown in Figure 24 
   even if there is no end-to-end signaling session. If the RMD-QOSM is 
   triggered based on an E2E signaling exchange then the RESERVE message
   is created by a node outside the RMD domain and will subsequently 
   travel further on (e.g., to the data receiver). Such an exchange is 
   shown in Figure 3. As such, an evaluation of RMD`s security MUST 
   always been seen as a combination of the two signaling sessions, (1) 
   and (2) of Figure 24. 

   The following security requirements are set as goals for the 
   intra-domain communication, namely:


Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 80]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


*  Nodes, which are never supposed to participate in the NSIS signaling 
   exchange, MUST NOT interfere with QNE Interior nodes. Off-path 
   nodes (off-path with regard to the path taken by a particular 
   signaling message exchange) MUST NOT be able to interfere with 
   other on-path signaling nodes. 

*  The actions allowed by a QNE Interior node SHOULD be minimal (i.e., 
   only those specified by the RMD-QOSM). For example, only the QNE 
   Ingress and the QNE Egress nodes are allowed to initiate certain 
   signaling messages. QNE Interior nodes are, for example, allowed to 
   modify certain signaling message payloads.  

   Note that the term `interfere` refers to all sorts of security 
   threats, such as denial of service, spoofing, replay, signaling 
   message injection, etc.

   If we assume that the RESERVE/RESPONSE is sent with hop-by-hop 
   channel security provided by GIST and protected between the QNE 
   Ingress and the QNE Egress node then we can
   be sure that the payloads of these messages MUST be authenticated, 
   integrity, replay protected and encrypted. Encryption is necessary to
   prevent an adversary that is located along the path of the RESERVE 
   message to learn information about the session that can later be used
   to inject a valid RESERVE`. The following messages need to relate to 
   each other to make sure that the occurrence of one message is not 
   without the other one: 

   a) the RESERVE and the RESERVE` relate to each other at the QNE 
      Egress and

   b) the RESPONSE and the RESERVE relate to each other at the QNE 
      Ingress and 

   c) the RESERVE` and the RESPONSE` relate to each other. The RII is 
   carried in the RESERVE` message and the RESPONSE` message that is 
   generated by the QNE Egress node contains the same RII as the 
   RESERVE`. The RII can be used by the QNE Ingress to match the 
   RESERVE` with the RESPONSE`. The QNE Egress is able to determine 
   whether the RESERVE` was created by the QNE Ingress node since the 
   intra-domain session, which sent the RESERVE`, is bound to an end-to-
   end session via the BOUND_SESSION_ID value included in the intra-
   domain QoS-NSLP operational state maintained at the QNE Egress.

   The RESERVE and the RESERVE` message are tied together using the 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID(s) maintained by the intra-domain and end-to-end 
   QoS-NSLP operational states maintained at the QNE edges, see Section 
   4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3. Hence, there cannot be a RESERVE` without a 
   corresponding RESERVE. The SESSION_ID can fulfill this purpose quite 
   well if the aim is to provide protection against off-path adversaries
   that do not see the SESSION_ID carried in the RESERVE and the 
   RESERVE` messages. 


Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 81]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   If, however, the path changes (due to re-routing or due to mobility) 
   then an adversary could inject RESERVE` messages (with a previously 
   seen SESSION_ID) and could potentially cause harm.

   An off-path adversary can, of course, create RESERVE` messages that 
   cause intermediate nodes to create some state (and cause other 
   actions) but the message would finally hit the QNE Egress node. The 
   QNE Egress node would then be able to determine that there is 
   something going wrong and generate an error message. 

   The severe congestion handling can be triggered by intermediate nodes 
   (unlike other messages). In many cases, however, intermediate nodes 
   experiencing congestion use refresh messages modify the <S> and 
   <O> parameters of the message. These messages are still 
   initiated by the QNE Ingress node and carry the SESSION_ID. The QNE 
   Egress node will use the SESSION_ID and subsequently the 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID, maintained by the intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational 
   state, to refer to a flow that might be terminated. The 
   aspect of intermediate nodes initiating messages for severe 
   congestion handling is for further study.

                 Figure 25: RMD REFRESH message exchange

   During the refresh procedure a RESERVE` creates a RESPONSE`, see 
   Figure 25. The RII is carried in the RESERVE` message and the 
   RESPONSE` message that is generated by the QNE Egress node contains 
   the same RII as the RESERVE`.

   The RII can be used by the QNE Ingress to match the RESERVE` with the 
   RESPONSE`. 

   A further aspect is marking of data traffic. Data packets can be 
   modified by an intermediary without any relationship to a signaling 
   session (and a SESSION_ID). The problem appears if an off-path 
   adversary injects spoofed data packets. 



Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 82]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   The adversary thereby needs to spoof data packets that relate to the 
   flow identifier of an existing end-to-end reservation that SHOULD be 
   terminated. Therefore the question arises how an off-path adversary 
   SHOULD create a data packet that matches an existing flow identifier 
   (if a 5-tuple is used). Hence, this might not turn out to be simple 
   for an adversary unless we assume the previously mentioned 
   mobility/re-routing case where the path through the network changes 
   and the set of nodes that are along a path changes over time.

Appendix A.1.1 Example of a remarking operation during severe 
congestion in the Interior nodes

   This appendix describes an example of a remarking operation during 
   severe congestion in the Interior nodes.
   Per supported PHB, the interior node can support the operation states
   depicted in Figure A.1, when the per-flow congestion notification 
   based on probing signaling scheme is used in combination with this 
   severe congestion type. Figure A.2 depicts the same functionality 
   when the per-flow congestion notification based on probing scheme is
   not used in combination with the severe congestion scheme. The 
   description given in this and the following appendices, focuses 
   on the situation that during the congestion notification state, the 
   "notified DSCP" marking and during the severe congestion state the 
   "encoded DSCP" and "affected DSCP" markings are used. In this case, 
   the "notified DSCP" marking is used during the congestion 
   notification state to mark all packets passing through an interior 
   node that operates in the congestion notification state. In this way, 
   and in combination with probing, an flow-based ECMP solution can be 
   provided for the congestion notification state. The "encoded DSCP" 
   marking is used to encode and signal the excess rate, measured at 
   interior nodes, to the egress nodes. The "affected DSCP" marking is 
   used to mark all packets that are passing through a severe congested 
   node and are not "encoded DSCP" marked.
   Another possible situation could be derived where both congestion 
   notification and severe congestion state are using the "encoded DSCP"
   marking, without using the "notified DSCP" marking. The "affected 
   DSCP" marking is used to mark all packets that are passing through 
   an Interior node that is in severe congestion state and are not 
   "encoded DSCP" marked. In addition, the probe packet that is carried 
   by an intra-domain RESERVE message and pass through Interior nodes 
   SHOULD be "encoded DSCP" marked if the Interior node is in 
   congestion notification or severe congestion states. Otherwise the 
   probe packet will remain unmarked. In this way an ECMP solution can 
   be provided for both congestion notification and severe congestion 
   states. The"encoded DSCP" packets are signaling excess rate that is 
   not only associated with interior nodes that are in severe congestion 
   state, but also with interior nodes that are in congestion 
   notification state.  The algorithm at the Interior node, is similar 
   to the algorithm described in the following appendix sections. 
   However, this method is not described in detail in this example.

        Figure A.2: States of operation, severe congestion without  
        congestion notification based on probing

   The terms used in Figure A.1 and Figure A.2 are:

   Normal state: represents the normal operation conditions of the 
   node,   i.e. no congestion 

   Severe congestion state: it represents the state when state the 
   interior node is severely congested related to a certain PHB. It is 
   important to emphasize that one of the targets of the severe 
   congestion state solution to change the severe congestion state 
   behaviour directly to the normal state. 

   Congestion notification: state where the load is relatively high, 
   close to the level when congestion can occur

   event A: this event occurs when the incoming PHB rate is higher than 
   the "congestion notification detection" threshold and lower than the   
   severe congestion detection". This threshold is used by the 
   congestion notification based on probing scheme, see 
   Section 4.6.1.7, 4.6.2.6.

   event B: this event occurs when the incoming PHB rate is higher than 
   the "severe congestion detection" threshold. 



Bader, et al.                                                [Page 89]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   event C: this event occurs when the incoming PHB rate is lower than  
   or equal to the "congestion notification detection" threshold. 

   event D: this event occurs when the incoming PHB rate is lower than 
   or equal to the "severe_congestion_restoration" threshold. It is 
   important to emphasize that this even supports one of the targets of 
   the severe congestion state solution to change the severe congestion 
   state behaviour directly to the normal state. 

   event E: this event occurs when the incoming PHB rate is lower than  
   or equal to the "severe congestion restoration" threshold. 

   Note that the "severe congestion detection", "severe congestion 
   restoration" and admission thresholds SHOULD be higher than the 
   "congestion notification detection" threshold, i.e.,: 
   "severe congestion detection" > "congestion notification detection" 
   and "severe congestion restoration" > "congestion notification 
   detection"

   Furthermore, the "severe congestion detection" threshold SHOULD be 
   higher than or equal to the admission threshold that is used by the 
   reservation based and NSIS measurement based signaling schemes.
   "severe congestion detection" >= admission threshold

   Moreover, the "severe congestion restoration" threshold SHOULD be 
   lower than or equal to the "severe congestion detection" threshold 
   that is used by the reservation based and NSIS measurement based 
   signaling schemes, i.e.,:

   "severe congestion restoration" <= "severe congestion detection" 

   During severe congestion the interior node calculates, per traffic 
   class (PHB), the incoming rate that is above the "severe congestion 
   restoration" threshold, denoted as signaled_overload_rate, in the 
   following way:

   * A severe congested interior node SHOULD take into account that 
   packets might be dropped. Therefore, before queuing and eventually 
   dropping packets, the interior node SHOULD count the total number of 
   unmarked and remarked bytes received by the severe congested node, 
   denote this number as total_received_bytes. Note that there are 
   situations when more than one interior nodes in the same path become 
   severe congested. Therefore, any interior node located behind a 
   severe congested node MAY receive marked bytes.

   When the "severe congestion detection" threshold per PHB is set 
   equal to the maximum capacity allocated to one PHB used by the RMD-
   QOSM it means that if the maximum capacity associated to a PHB is 
   fully utilized and a packet belonging to this PHB arrives, then it is 
   assumed that the interior node will not forward this packet 
   downstream.


Bader, et al.                                                [Page 90]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   In other words this packet will either be dropped or set to another 
   PHB. Furthermore, this also means that after the severe congestion 
   situation is solved, then the ongoing flows will be able to send 
   their associated packets up to a total rate equal to the maximum 
   capacity associated to the PHB. Therefore, when more than one 
   interior nodes located on the same path will be severe congested and 
   when the interior node receives "encoded DSCP" marked packets, then 
   it will mean that an interior node located upstream is also severely 
   congested. 

   When the "severe congestion detection" threshold per PHB 
   is set equal to the maximum capacity allocated to one PHB, then this   
   interior node MUST forward the "encoded DSCP" marked packets and it 
   SHOULD NOT consider these packets during its local remarking process. 
   In other words, the egress should see the excess rates encoded by the 
   different severe congested interior nodes as independent, and 
   therefore, these independent excess rates will be added. 
   
   When the "severe congestion detection" threshold per PHB 
   is not set equal to the maximum capacity allocated to one PHB then 
   this means that after the severe congestion situation is solved, the 
   ongoing flows will not be able to send their associated packets 
   up to a total rate equal to the maximum capacity associated to the 
   PHB, but only up to the "severe_congestion_threshold". When more than 
   one interior nodes located on the same communication path are severe 
   congested and when one of these interior node receives "encoded_DSCP" 
   marked packets then this interior node SHOULD NOT mark unmarked,  
   i.e., either "original DSCP" or "affected DSCP" or "notified DSCP"" 
   encoded packets, up to a rate equal to the difference between the 
   maximum PHB capacity and the "severe congestion threshold", when the 
   incoming "encoded DSCP"" marked packets are already able to signal 
   this difference. In this case the "severe congestion threshold" 
   SHOULD be configured in all interior nodes, which are located in the 
   RMD domain, and equal to:

  "severe_congestion_threshold" = 
   = Maximum PHB capacity - threshold_offset_rate

   The threshold_offset_rate represents rate and SHOULD have the same 
   value in all interior nodes.

   * before queuing and eventually dropping the packets, at the end of 
   each measurement interval of T seconds, calculate the current 
   estimated overloaded rate, say measured_overload_rate, by using the 
   following equation:

   measured_overload_rate = 
   =((total_received_bytes)/T)-severe_congestion_restoration)




Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 91]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   To provide reliable estimation of the encoded information several 
   techniques can be used, see [AtLi01], [AdCa03], [ThCo04], [AnHa06].
   Note that since marking is done in interior nodes, the decisions are 
   made at egress nodes, and termination of flows are performed by 
   ingress nodes, there is a significant delay until the overload 
   information is learned by the ingress nodes, see Section 6 of 
   [CsTa05]). The delay consists of the trip time of data packets from 
   the severe congested interior node to the egress, the measurement 
   interval, i.e., T, and the trip time of the notification signaling 
   messages from egress to ingress. Moreover, until the overload 
   decreases at the severe congested interior node, an additional trip 
   time from the ingress node to the severe congested interior node MUST 
   expire. This is because immediately before receiving the congestion 
   notification, the ingress MAY have sent out packets in the flows that 
   were selected for termination. That is, a terminated flow MAY 
   contribute to congestion for a time longer that is taken from the 
   ingress to the interior node. Without considering the above, interior 
   nodes would continue marking the packets until the measured 
   utilization falls below the severe congestion restoration threshold. 
   In this way, at the end more flows will be terminated than necessary, 
   i.e., an over-reaction takes place. [CsTa05] provides a solution to 
   this problem, where the interior nodes use a sliding window memory to 
   keep track of the signaling overload in a couple of previous 
   measurement intervals. At the end of a measurement intervals, T,  
   before encoding and signaling the overloaded rate as "encoded DSCP" 
   packets, the actual overload is decreased with the sum of already 
   signaled overload stored in the sliding window memory, since that 
   overload is already being handled in the severe congestion handling 
   control loop. The sliding window memory consists of an integer number 
   of cells, i.e, n = maximum number of cells. Guidelines for 
   configuring the sliding window parameters are given in [CsTa05].

   At the end of each measurement interval, the newest calculated 
   overload is pushed into the memory, and the oldest cell is dropped.

   If Mi is the overload_rate stored in ith memory cell (i = [1..n]), 
   then at the end of every measurement interval, the overload rate that 
   is signaled to the egress node, i.e., signaled_overload_rate is 
   calculated as follows:

   Sum_Mi =0
   For i =1 to n
   {
   Sum_Mi = Sum_Mi + Mi
   }

   signaled_overload_rate = measured_overload_rate - Sum_Mi, 

   where Sum_Mi is calculated as above.

   Next, the sliding memory is updated as follows:
       for i = 1..(n-1): Mi <- Mi+1
       Mn <- signaled_overload_rate

Bader, et al.                                                [Page 92]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   The bytes that have to be remarked to satisfy the signaled overload 
   rate: signaled_remarked_bytes, are calculated using the 
   following pseudo code:
   IF severe_congestion_threshold <> Maximum PHB capacity 
   THEN 
    { 
     IF (incoming_encoded-DSCP_rate <> 0) AND 
        (incoming_encoded-DSCP_rate =< termination_offset_rate)
     THEN 
        { signaled_remarked_bytes = 
         = ((signaled_overload_rate - incoming_encoded-DSCP_rate)*T)/N
        }   
     ELSE IF (incoming_encoded-DSCP_rate > termination_offset_rate) 
     THEN signaled_remarked_bytes = 
         = ((signaled_overload_rate - termination_offset_rate)*T)/N
     ELSE IF (incoming_encoded-DSCP_rate =0) 
     THEN signaled_remarked_bytes = 
         = signaled_overload_rate*T/N    
     }
    ELSE signaled_remarked_bytes =  signaled_overload_rate *T/N

    Where the incoming "encoded DSCP" rate is calculated as follows:
    incoming_encoded-DSCP_rate = 
     = (received number of "encoded_DSCP" during T) * N)/T;

   The signal_remarked_bytes represents also the number of 
   the outgoing packets (after the dropping stage) that MUST be 
   remarked, during each measurement interval T, by a node when operates 
   in severe congestion mode. 

   Note that in order to process an overload situation higher than 100% 
   of the maintained severe congestion threshold all the nodes within 
   the domain MUST be configured and maintain a scaling parameter, e.g., 
   N used in the above equation, which in combination with the marked 
   bytes, e.g., signaled_remarked_bytes, such a high overload situation 
   can be calculated and represented. N can be equal or higher than 1.

   Note that when incoming remarked bytes are dropped, the operation of 
   the severe congestion algorithm MAY be affected, e.g., the algorithm 
   MAY become in certain situations slower. An implementation of the 
   algorithm MAY assure as much as possible that the incoming marked 
   bytes are not dropped. This could for example be accomplished by 
   using different dropping rate thresholds for marked and unmarked 
   bytes.

   Note that when the "affected DSCP" marking is used by a node 
   that is congested due to a a severe congestion situation then all 
   the outgoing packets that are not marked (i.e., by using the "encoded 
   DSCP") have to be remarked using the "affected DSCP" marking. 

   The "encoded DSCP" and the "affected DSCP" marked packets (when 
   applied in the whole RMD domain) are propagated to the QNE edge 
   nodes.

Bader, et al.                                                [Page 93]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

 
   Furthermore, note that when the congestion notification based on 
   probing is used in combination with severe congestion, then in 
   addition to the possible "encoded DSCP" and "affected DSCP" another 
   DSCP for the remarking of the same PHB is used, see Section 4.6.1.7. 
   This additional DSCP is denoted in this document as "notified 
   DSCP". When an interior node operates 
   in the severe congested state, see Figure A.2, and receives "notified 
   DSCP" packets, these packets are considered to be unmarked packets 
   (but not "affected DSCP" packets). This means that during severe 
   congestion also the "notified DSCP" packets can be remarked and 
   encoded as either "encoded DSCP" or "affected DSCP" packets.


Appendix A.1.2 Example of a detailed severe congestion operation in the 
Egress nodes

   This appendix describes an example of a detailed severe congestion 
   operation in the Egress nodes.
  
   The states of operation in Egress nodes are similar to the ones 
   described in  A.1.1. The definition of the events, see below, is
   however different than the definition of the events given in Figure 
   A.1 and Figure A.2:

   * event A: when the egress receives a predefined rate of "notified 
   DSCP" marked bytes/packets then event_A is activated, see Section 
   4.6.1.7 and A.2.2. The predefined rate of "notified DSCP" marked 
   bytes is denoted as the congestion notification detection threshold. 
   Note this congestion notification detection threshold can also be 
   zero, meaning that the event_A is activated when the egress node, 
   during an interval T, receives at least one "notified DSCP" packet.

   * event B: this event occurs when the egress receives packets marked 
   as either "encoded DSCP" or "affected DSCP" (when "affected DSCP" is 
   applied in the whole RMD domain). 

   * event C: this event occurs when the rate of incoming 
   "notified DSCP" packets decreases below the congestion notification 
   detection threshold. In the situation that the congestion 
   notification detection threshold is zero, this will mean that event C 
   is activated when the egress node, during an interval T, does not 
   receive any "notified DSCP" marked packets.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   * event D: this event occurs when the egress, during an interval T, 
   does not receive packets marked as either "encoded DSCP" or "affected 
   DSCP" (when "affected DSCP" is applied in the whole RMD domain). 
   Note that when "notified DSCP" is applied in the whole RMD domain for 
   the support of congestion notification, then this event could cause 
   the following change in operation state. 
   When the egress, during an interval T, does not receive (1) packets 
   marked as either "encoded DSCP" or "affected DSCP" (when "affected 
   DSCP" is applied in the whole RMD domain) and (2) it does NOT receive 
   "notified DSCP" marked packets then the change in the operation state 
   occurs from the "Severe congestion state" to "Normal state".
   When the egress, during an interval T, does not receive (1) packets 
   marked as either "encoded DSCP" or "affected DSCP" (when "affected 
   DSCP" is applied in the whole RMD domain) and (2) it does receive 
   "notified DSCP" marked packets then the change in the operation state 
   occurs from the "Severe congestion state" to "Congestion notification 
   state".

   * event E: this event occurs when the egress, during an interval T, 
   does not receive packets marked as either "encoded DSCP" or 
   "affected DSCP" (when "affected DSCP" is applied in the whole RMD 
   domain)

   An example of the algorithm for calculation of the number of flows 
   associated with each priority class that have to be terminated is 
   explained by the pseudo-code below. 
   
   The edge nodes are able to support severe congestion handling by: (1) 
   identifying which flows were affected by the severe congestion and 
   (2) selecting and terminating some of these flows such that the 
   quality of service of the remaining flows is recovered.

   The "encoded DSCP" and the "affected DSCP" marked packets (when 
   applied in the whole RMD domain) are received by the QNE edge node.

   The QNE edge nodes keep per flow state and therefore they can 
   translate the calculated bandwidth to be terminated, to number of 
   flows. The QNE egress node records the excess rate and the identity 
   of all the flows, arriving at the QNE egress node, with 
   "encoded DSCP" and with "affected DSCP" (when applied in the whole 
   RMD domain); only these flows, which are the ones passing through the 
   severely congested interior node(s), are candidates for termination. 
   The excess rate is calculated by measuring the rate of all the
   "encoded DSCP" data packets that arrive at the QNE egress node. The 
   Measured excess rate is converted by the egress node, by multiplying 
   it by the factor N, which was used by the QNE interior node(s) to 
   encode the overload level.







Bader, et al.                                                [Page 95]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                RMD-QOSM
 

   When different priority flows are supported all the low priority 
   flows that arrived at the egress node are terminated first. Next all 
   the medium priority flows are stopped and finally, if necessary, even 
   high priority flows are chosen. Within a priority class both "encoded 
   DSCP" and "aected DSCP" are considered before the mechanism moves to 
   higher priority class. Finally, for each flow that has to be 
   terminated the egress node sends a NOTIFY message to the ingress node 
   which stops the flow.

   Below this algorithm is described in detail.
   First, when the egress operates in the severe congestion state then 
   the total amount of remarked bandwidth associated with the PHB 
   traffic class, say total_congested_bandwidth, is calculated.
   Note that when the node maintains information about 
   each ingress/egress pair aggregate, then the 
   total_congested_bandwidth MUST be calculated per ingress/egress pair 
   reservation aggregate. This bandwidth represents the severe congested 
   bandwidth that SHOULD be terminated. The total_congested_bandwidth 
   can be calculated as follows:

   total_congested_bandwidth = N*input_remarked_bytes/T

   Where, input_remarked_bytes represents the number of "encoded DSCP" 
   marked bytes that arrive at the egress, during one measurement 
   interval T, N is defined as in Section 4.6.1.6.2.1 and A.1.1. The 
   term denoted as terminated_bandwidth is a temporal variable 
   representing the total bandwidth that have to be terminated, 
   belonging to the same PHB traffic class. The   
   terminate_flow_bandwidth(priority_class) is the total of bandwidth 
   associated with flows of priority class equal to priority_class. The 
   parameter priority_class is an integer fulfilling 

   0 =< priority_class =< Maximum_priority.

   The QNE egress node records the identity of the QNE Ingress Node that
   forwarded each flow, the total_congested_bandwidth and the identity 
   of all the flows, arriving at the QNE Egress Node, with "encoded 
   DSCP" and "affected DSCP" (when applied in whole RMD domain). This 
   ensures that only these flows, which are the ones passing through the 
   severely overloaded QNE interior node(s), are candidates for 
   termination. The selection of the flows to be terminated is described 
   in the pseudo-code that is given below, which is realized by the 
   function denoted below as calculate_terminate_flows().

   The calculate_terminate_flows() function uses the 
   terminate_bandwidth_class value and translates this bandwidth value
   to number of flows that have to be terminated. Only the "encoded 
   DSCP" flows and "affected DSCP" (when applied in whole RMD domain)
   flows, which are the ones passing through the severely overloaded
   interior node(s), are candidates for termination. 



Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 96]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   After the flows to be terminated are selected the 
   sum_bandwidth_terminate(priority_class) value is calculated that is 
   the sum of the bandwidth associated with the flows, belonging to a 
   certain priority class, which will certainly be terminated.
   The constraint of finding the total number of flows that have to
   be terminated is that sum_bandwidth_terminate(priority_class), SHOULD 
   be smaller or approximatelly equal to the variable 
   terminate_bandwidth(priority_class).


     terminated_bandwidth = 0;
     priority_class = 0;
     while terminated_bandwidth < total_congested_bandwidth 
      {
       terminate_bandwidth(priority_class) = 
       = total_congested_bandwidth - terminated_bandwidth
       calculate_terminate_flows(priority_class);
       terminated_bandwidth =  
       = sum_bandwidth_terminate(priority_class) + terminated_bandwidth;
       priority_class = priority_class + 1;
      }
     
   If the egress node maintains ingress/egress pair reservation 
   aggregates, then the above algorithm is performed for each 
   ingress/egress pair reservation aggregate. 

   Finally, for each flow that has to be terminated the QNE egress node 
   sends a NOTIFY message to the QNE ingress node to terminate the flow.


Appendix A.2.1 Example of a detailed remarking admission control 
(congestion notification) operation in Interior nodes 


   This appendix describes an example of a detailed remarking admission 
   control (congestion notification) operation in Interior nodes. 
   The predefined congestion notification threshold, see Appendix A.1.1,
   is set according to, and usually less than, an engineered bandwidth 
   limitation, i.e., admission threshold, based on e.g. agreed Service 
   Level Agreement or a capacity limitation of specific links. 
   The difference between the congestion notification threshold and the 
   engineered bandwidth limitation, i.e., admission threshold, provides 
   an interval where the signaling information on resource limitation is
   already sent by a node but the actual resource limitation is not 
   reached. This is due to the fact that data packets associated with an 
   admitted session have not yet arrived, while allows the admission 
   control process available at the egress to interpret the signaling 
   information and reject new calls before reaching congestion.

   Note that in the situation when the data rate is higher than the 
   preconfigured congestion notification rate, also data packets are 
   re-marked, see section 4.6.1.6.2.1. To distinguish between congestion 
   notification and severe congestion, two methods MAY be used (see 
   Appendix 1.1.1):

   * using different DSCP values (re-marked DSCP values). The remarked 
   DSCP that is used for this purpose is denoted as "notified DSCP" in 
   this document. When this method is used and when the interior node is
   in "congestion notification" state, see A.1.1, then the node SHOULD 
   remark all the unmarked bytes passing through the node using the 
   "notified DSCP". Note that this method can only be applied if all 
   nodes in RMD domain use the "notified" DSCP marking. In this way, 
   also probe packets that will pass through the interior node that 
   operates in congestion notification state are being encoded using the 
   "notified DSCP" marking.


   * Using the "encoded DSCP" marking for congestion notification and 
   severe congestion. This method is not described in detail in this 
   example appendix. 


Appendix A.2.2 Example of a detailed admission control (congestion 
notification) operation in Egress nodes 

   This appendix describes an example of a detailed admission control 
  (congestion notification) operation in Egress nodes.

   The admission control congestion notification procedure can be 
   applied only if the egress maintains the ingress/egress pair 
   aggregate. When the operation state of the ingress/egress pair 
   aggregate is the "congestion notification", see Appendix A.1.2, then 
   the implementation of the algorithm depends on how the congestion 
   notification situation is notified to the egress. As mentioned in 
   Section A.2.1, two methods are used:

   * using the "notified DSCP". During a measurement interval T, the 
   egress counts the number of "notified DSCP" marked bytes that belong 
   to the same PHB and are associated with the same ingress/egress pair 
   aggregate, say input_notified_bytes. We denote the rate as 
   incoming_notified_rate. 

   * using the "encoded DSCP". In this case, during a measurement 
   interval T, the egress measures the input_notified_bytes by counting 
   the "encoded DSCP" bytes.

   Below only the detail description of the first method is given.
  
   The incoming congestion_rate can be then calculated as follows:


Bader, et al.                                                [Page 98]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                RMD-QOSM


   incoming_congestion_rate = input_notified_bytes/T

   If the incoming_congestion_rate is higher than a preconfigured 
   congestion notification threshold, then the communication path 
   between ingress and egress is considered to be congested. Note that 
   the pre-congestion notification threshold can be set to zero. In this 
   case the egress node will operate in congestion notification state at 
   the moment that it receives at least one "notified DSCP" encoded 
   packet. 

   When the egress node operates in "congestion notification" state 
   and if the end-to-end RESERVE (probe) arrives at the egress, then 
   this request SHOULD be rejected. Note that this is happening 
   only when the probe packet is either "notified DSCP" or "encoded 
   DSCP" marked. In this way it is ensured that the end-to-end RESERVE 
   (probe) packet passed through the node that it is congested. This 
   feature is very useful when ECMP based routing is used to detect 
   Only flows that are passing through the congested router. 
  
   If such an ingress/egress pair aggregated state is not available when
   the (probe) RESERVE message arrives at the egress, then this request 
   is accepted if the DSCP of the packet carrying the RESERVE messsage 
   is unmarked. Otherwise (if the packet is either "notified DSCP" or 
   "encoded DSCP" marked), it is rejected.


Appendix A.3.1 Example of selecting bi-directional flows for termination 
during severe congestion

   This appendix describes an example of selecting bi-directional flows 
   for termination during severe congestion.  
   When a severe congestion occurs on e.g., in the forward path, and 
   when the algorithm terminates flows to solve the severe congestion in 
   forward path, then the reserved bandwidth associated with the 
   terminated bidirectional flows is also released. Therefore, a careful 
   selection of the flows that have to be terminated SHOULD take place. 
   A possible method of selecting the flows belonging to the same 
   priority type passing through the severe congestion point on a 
   unidirectional path can be the following: 

   * the egress node SHOULD select, if possible, first unidirectional 
   flows instead of bidirectional flows 
   * the egress node SHOULD select, if possible, bidirectional flows 
   that reserved a relatively small amount of resources on the path 
   reversed to the path of congestion.

Appendix A.3.2 Example of a severe congestion solution for bi-
directional flows congested simultaneously on forward and reverse path

   This appendix describes an example of a severe congestion solution 
   for bi-directional flows congested simultaneously on forward and 
   reverse path.

   This scenario describes a solution using the combination of the 
   severe congestion solutions described in Section 4.6.2.5.2.
   It is considered that the severe congestion occurs simultaneously on 
   forward and reverse directions, which MAY affect the same bi-
   directional flows. 

   When the QNE Edges maintain per-flow intra-domain QoS-NSLP 
   operational states then the steps can be the following, see Figure 
   A.3. Consider that the egress node selects a number of bi-directional
   flows to be terminated. In this case the egress will send for each 
   bi-directional flows a NOTIFY message to ingress. If the Ingress 
   receives these NOTIFY messages and its operational state (associated 
   with reverse path) is in the severe congestion state (see Figure A.1 
   and A.2), then the ingress operates in the following way:

   * For each NOTIFY message, the Ingress SHOULD identify the 
   bidirectional flows have to be terminated. 

   * The ingress then calculates the total bandwidth that SHOULD be 
   released in the reverse direction (thus not in forward direction) if
   the bidirectional flows will be terminated (preempted), say 
   "notify_reverse_bandwidth". This bandwidth can be calculated by the 
   sum of the bandwidth values associated with all the end-to-end 
   sessions that received a (severe congestion) NOTIFY message. 

   * Furthermore, using the received marked packets (from the reverse 
   path) the ingress will calculate, using the algorithm used by an 
   egress and described in A.1.2, the total bandwidth that has to be 
   terminated in order to solve the congestion in the reverse path 
   direction, say "marked_reverse_bandwidth". 

   * The ingress then calculates the bandwidth of the additional flows 
   that have to be terminated, say "additional_reverse_bandwidth", in 
   order to solve the severe congestion in reverse direction, by taking
   into account:

   ** the bandwidth in the reverse direction of the bidirectional flows 
   that were appointed by the egress (the ones that received a NOTIFY 
   message) to be preempted, i.e., "notify_reverse_bandwidth"

   **  the total amount of bandwidth in the reverse direction that has 
   been calculated by using the received marked packets, i.e., 
   "marked_reverse_bandwidth".

   algorithm:

    IF ("marked_reverse_bandwidth" > "notify_reverse_bandwidth") THEN
    "additional_reverse_bandwidth" =
     = "marked_reverse_bandwidth"- "notify_reverse_bandwidth";

* Ingress terminates the flows that experienced a severe congestion 
in the "forward" path and received a (severe congestion) NOTIFY 
   message 

   * If possible the ingress SHOULD terminate unidirectional flows that 
   are using the same egress-ingress reverse direction communication 
   path to satisfy the release of a total bandiwtdh up equal to the: 
   "additional_reverse_bandwidth", see Appendix 3.1.

   * If the number of REQUIRED uni-directional flows (to satisfy the 
   above issue) is not available, then a number of bi-directional flows 
   that are using the same egress-ingress reverse direction 
   communication path MAY be selected for pre-emption in order to 
   satisfy the release of a total bandiwtdh equal up to the: 
   "additional_reverse_bandwidth".  Note that using the guidelines given
   in Appendix A.3.1, first the bidirectional flows that reserved a 
   relatively small amount of resources on the path reversed to the path
   of congestion SHOULD be selected for termination. 

   When the QNE Edges maintain aggregated intra-domain QoS-NSLP 
   operational states then the steps can be the following.

   * The egress calculates the bandwidth to be terminated using the same
   method as described in Section 4.6.1.6.2.2. The egress includes this  
   bandwidth value in a <PDR Bandwidth> within a "PDR_Congestion_Report"
   container that is carried by the end-to-end NOTIFY message. 

   * The Ingress receives the NOTIFY message and reads the <PDR 
   Bandwidth> value included in the "PDR_Congestion_Report" container. 
   Note that this value is denoted as "notify_reverse_bandwidth" in the 
   situation that the QNE edges maintain per flow intra-domain QoS-NSLP 
   operational states, but is calculated differently. The variables 
   "marked_reverse_bandwidth" and "additional_reverse_bandwidth are 
   calculated using the same steps as explained for the situation that 
   the QNE edges maintain per flow intra-domain QoS-NSLP states. 

   * Regarding the termination of flows that are using the same egress-
   ingress reverse direction communication path, the Ingress can follow
   the same procedures as the situation that the QNE edges 
   maintain per-flow intra-domain QoS-NSLP operational states. 

   The RMD aggregated (reduced state) reservations maintained by the 
   interior nodes, can be reduced in the "forward" and "reverse" 
   directions by using the procedure described in Section 4.6.2.3 and 
   including in the "Peak Data Rate-1 (p)" value of the local RMD-QSpec 
   <TMOD-1> parameter of the RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired> field carried by the 
   "forward" intra-domain RESERVE the value equal to 
   "notify_reverse_bandwidth" and by including the 
   "additional_reverse_bandwidth" value in the <PDR Bandwidth> parameter
   within the "PDR_Release_Request" container that is carried by the 
   same intra-domain RESERVE message.

Appendix A.4 Example of pre-emption handling during admission control

   This appendix describes an example of how pre-emption handling is 
   supported during admission control.
   This section describes the mechanism that can be supported by the 
   QNE Ingress, QNE Interior and QNE Egress nodes to satisfy 
   pre-emption during the admission control process. 
   This mechanism uses the pre-emption building blocks specified in 
   [QoS-NSLP].
   
A.4.1 Pre-emption handling in QNE Ingress nodes

   If a QNE Ingress receives a RESERVE for a session that causes other 
   session(s) to be pre-empted, for each of these to be pre-empted 
   sessions, then the QNE Ingress follows the following steps:

   Step_1:

   The QNE Ingress MUST send a tearing RESERVE downstream and add a 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID, with Binding_Code value equal to "Indicated session 
   caused pre-emption" that indicates the SESSION_ID of the session that 
   caused the pre-emption. Furthermore, an INFO-SPEC object with error 
   code value equal to "Reservation pre-empted" has to be included in 
   each of these tearing RESERVE messages.
   The selection of which flows have to be preempted can be based on 
   predefined policies. For example, this selection process can be based 
   on the MRI associated with the high and low priority sessions. In 
   particular, the QNE Ingress can select low(er) priority session(s) 
   where their MRI is "close" (especially the target IP) to the one 
   associated with the higher priority session. This means that 
   typically the high priority session and the to be preempted lower 
   priority sessions are following the same communication path and are 
   passing through the same QNE Egress node. 

   Furthermore, the amount of lower priority sessions that have to be 
   pre-empted per each high priority session, has to be such that the 
   requested resources by the higher priority session SHOULD be lower or 
   equal than the sum of the reserved resources associated with the 
   lower priority sessions that have to be pre-empted.

   Step_2:

   For each of the sent tearing RESERVE(s) the QNE Ingress will send a 
   NOTIFY message with an INFO-SPEC objects with error code value equal 
   to "Reservation pre-empted" towards the QNI.

   Step_3:

   After sending the pre-empted (tearing) RESERVE(s), the Ingress QNE 
   will send the (reserving) RESERVE, which caused the pre-emption, 
   downstream towards the QNE Egress.
 

Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 103]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


A.4.2 Pre-emption handling in QNE Interior nodes

   The QNE Interior upon receiving the first (tearing) RESERVE that 
   carries the BOUND_SESSION_ID object with Binding_Code value equal to 
   "Indicated session caused pre-emption" and an INFO-SPEC object with 
   error code value equal to "Reservation preempted" it considers that 
   this session has to be pre-empted.
   In this case the QNE Interior creates a so called "pre-emption 
   state", which is identified by the SESSION_ID carried in the 
   pre-emption related BOUND_SESSION_ID object. Furthermore, this 
   "pre-emption state" will include the SESSION_ID of the session 
   associated with the (tearing) RESERVE. If subsequently additional 
   tearing RESERVE(s) are arriving including the same values of 
   BOUND_SESSION_ID and INFO-SPEC objects, then the associated 
   SESSION_IDs of these (tearing) RESERVE message will be included in 
   the already created "pre-emption state". The QNE will then set a 
   timer, with a value that is high enough to ensure that it will not 
   expire before the (reserving) RESERVE arrives. 
   Note that when the "pre-emption state" timer expires then the   
   bandwidth associated with the pre-empted session(s) will have to be 
   released, following a normal RMD-QOSM bandwidth release procedure..
   If the QNE interior node will not receive the all to be pre-empted 
   (tearing) RESERVE messages sent by the QNE Ingress before their 
   associated (reserving) RESERVE message arrives, then the (reserving) 
   RESERVE message will not reserve any resources and this message will 
   be "M" marked, see Section 4.6.1.2. Note that this situation is not a
   typical situation. Typically, this situation can only occur when at 
   least one of (tearing) RESERVe messages are dropped due to an error 
   condition. 

   Otherwise, if the QNE Interior receives the all to be pre-empted 
   (tearing) RESERVE messages sent by the QNE Ingress, then the QNE 
   Interior will remove the pending resources, and make the new 
   reservation using normal RMD-QOSM bandwidth release and reservation 
   procedures.


A.4.3 Pre-emption handling in QNE Egress nodes

   Similar to the QNE Interior operation, the QNE Egress upon receiving 
   the first (tearing) RESERVE that carries the BOUND_SESSION_ID object 
   with Binding_Code value equal to "Indicated session caused 
   pre-emption" and an INFO-SPEC object with error code value equal to  
   "Reservation preempted" it considers that this session has to be pre-
   empted. Similar to the QNE Interior operation the QNE Egress creates 
   a so called "pre-emption state", which is identified by the 
   SESSION_ID carried in the pre-emption related BOUND_SESSION_ID 
   object. This "pre-emption state" will store the same type of 
   information and use the same timer value as specified in section 
   A.4.2.


Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 104]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   If subsequently additional tearing RESERVE(s) are arriving including 
   the same values of BOUND_SESSION_ID and INFO-SPEC objects, then the 
   associated SESSION_IDs of these (tearing) RESERVE message will be 
   included in the already created "pre-emption state". 
   If the (reserving) RESERVE sent by the QNE Ingress node arrived and 
   is not "M" marked and if all the to be pre-empted (tearing) RESERVE 
   messages arrived then the QNE Egress will remove the pending 
   resources and make the new reservation using normal RMD-QOSM 
   procedures. 
  
   If the QNE Egress receives a "M" marked RESERVE message then the QNE 
   Egress will use the normal partial RMD-QOSM procedure to release the 
   partial reserved resources associated with the "M" marked RESERVE, 
   see Section 4.6.1.2.   

   If the QNE Egress will not receive all the to be pre-empted (tearing) 
   RESERVE messages sent by the QNE Ingress before their associated and 
   not "M" marked (reserving) RESERVE message arrives, then the 
   following steps can be followed:

 * If the QNE Egress uses an end-to-end QOSM supports the pre-emption 
   handling then the QNE Egress have to calculate and select new 
   lower priority sessions that have to be terminated. The way of how 
   the to be pre-empted sessions are selected and signalled to the 
   downstream QNEs is similar to the operation specified in Section 
   A.4.1. 
 * If the QNE Egress does not use an end-to-end QOSM that supports  
   the pre-emption handling then the QNE Egress has to reject the 
   requesting (reserving) RESERVE associated with the high priority 
   session, see Section 4.6.1.2.  

   Note that typically, the situation that the QNE Egress does not 
   receive all the to be pre-empted (tearing) RESERVE messages sent by 
   the QNE Ingress can only occur when at least one of (tearing) RESERVe 
   messages are dropped due to an error condition.


A.5 Example of a retransmission procedure within the RMD domain

   This appendix describes an example of a retransmission procedure that 
   can be used in the RMD domain.
   If the retransmission of intra-domain RESERVE messages within the RMD 
   domain is not disallowed then all the QNE Interior nodes SHOULD use 
   the functionality described in this section.

   In this situation we enable QNE Interior nodes to maintain a replay 
   cache in which each entry contains the <RSN>, <SESSION_ID> (available 
   via GIST), <REFRESH_PERIOD> (available via the QoS NSLP [QoS-NSLP]) 
   and the last received "PHR Container" <Container ID> carried by the 
   RMD-QSpec for each session [QSP-T]. Thus this solution uses 
   information carried by QOS-NSLP objects [QoS-NSLP] and parameters 
   carried by the RMD-QSpec "PHR Container". The following phases can be 
   distinguished:

   Phase 1: Create Replay Cache Entry

   When an Interior node receives an intra-domain RESERVE 
   message and its cache is empty or there is no matching entry, it 
   reads the <Container ID> field of the "PHR container" of the received 
   message. If the <Container ID> is a PHR_RESOURCE_REQUEST, which 
   indicates that the intra-domain Reserve message is a reservation 
   request, then the QNE Interior node creates a new entry in the cache 
   and copies the <RSN>, <SESSION_ID> and <Container ID> to the entry 
   and sets the <REFRESH_PERIOD>.
   By using the information stored in the List the Interior node 
   verifies whether the received intra-domain RESERVE message is sent 
   by an adversary or not. For example, if the <SESSION_ID> and <RSN> of 
   a received intra-domain RESERVE message match the values stored in 
   the List then the Interior node checks the <Container ID> part. 

   If the <Container_ID> is different then: 

     Situation D1: <Container ID> in its own list is 
        PHR_RESOURCE_REQUEST, and <Container ID> in the message is 
        PHR_REFRESH_UPDATE; 

     Situation D2: <Container ID> in its own list is 
        PHR_RESOURCE_REQUEST or PHR_REFRESH_UPDATE, and <Container ID> 
        in the message is PHR_RELEASE_REQUEST; 

     Situation D3: <Container ID> in its own list is PHR_REFRESH_UPDATE,
        and <Container ID> in the message is PHR_RESOURCE_REQUEST; 

    For Situation D1, the QNE Interior node processes this message by 
    RMD-QoSM default operation, reserves bandwidth, updates the entry 
    and passes the message to downstream nodes. For Situation D2, the 
    QNE Interior node processes this message by RMD-QoSM default 
    operation, releases bandwidth, deletes all entries associated with 
    the session and passes the message to downstream nodes. For 
    situation D3, the QNE Interior node does not use/process the 
    local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter carried by the received intra-
    domain RESERVE message. Furthermore, the <K> flag in the "PHR 
    Container" have to be set such that the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1>  
    parameter carried by the intra-domain RESERVE message is not 
    processed/used by a QNE Interior node.



Bader, et al.                                                 [Page 106]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


    If the <Container_ID> is the same then: 

     Situation S1: <Container ID> is equal to PHR_RESOURCE_REQUEST; 
     Situation S2: <Container ID> is equal to PHR_REFRESH_UPDATE;

     For situation S1, the QNE Interior node does not process the 
     intra-domain RESERVE message but it just passes it to 
     downstream nodes, because 
     it might have been retransmitted by the QNE Ingress node;
     For situation S2, the QNE Interior node processes the first 
     incoming intra-domain (refresh) RESERVE message within a refresh 
     period and updates the entry and forwards it to the downstream 
     nodes.

    If only <Session_ID> is matched to the list, then the QNE Interior 
    Node checks the <RSN>. Here also two situations can be 
    distinguished:

    If a rerouting takes place, see Section 5.2.5.2 in [QoS-NSLP], the  
    <RSN> in the message will be equal either to <RSN + 2> in the 
    stored list if it is not a tearing RESERVE or to <RSN -1> in the 
     stored list if it is a tearing RESERVE:

     The QNE Interior node will check the <Container ID> part; 

     If the <RSN> in the message is equal to <RSN + 2> in the 
     stored list and the <Container ID> is a PHR_RESOURCE_REQUEST or 
     PHR_REFRESH_UPDATE then the received intra-domain RESERVE 
     message has to be interpreted and processed as a typical 
     (non tearing) RESERVE message, which is caused by rerouting, see 
      Section 5.2.5.2 in [QoS-NSLP].

     If the <RSN> in the message is equal to <RSN-1> in the 
     stored list and the <Container ID> is a PHR_RELEASE_REQUEST    
     then the received intra-domain RESERVE message has to be 
     interpreted and processed as a typical (tearing) RESERVE 
     message, which is caused by rerouting, see Section 5.2.5.2 in 
     [QoS-NSLP].

     If other situations occur than the ones described above, then 
     the QNE Interior node does not use/process the local RMD-QSpec 
     <TMOD-1> parameter carried by the received intra-domain RESERVE 
     message. Furthermore, the <K> paramer has to be set, see above.

    Phase 2: Update Replay Cache Entry

    When a QNE Interior node receives an intra-domain RESERVE message, 
    it retrieves the corresponding entry from the cache and compares the 
    values. If the message is valid, the Interior node will update 
    <Container ID> and <REFRESH_PERIOD> in the List entry.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


    Phase 3: Delete Replay Cache Entry

    When a QNE Interior node receives an intra-domain (tear) RESERVE 
    message and an entry in the replay cache can be found, then the 
    QNE Interior node will delete this entry after processing the 
    message. Furthermore, the Interior node will delete cache entries, 
    if it did not receive an intra-domain (refresh) Reserve message 
    during the <REFRESH_PERIOD> period with a <Container_ID> value equal 
    to PHR_REFRESH_UPDATE.

A.6.  Example on matching the initiator QSPEC to the local RMD-QSPEC

   Section 3.4 of [QSP-T] describes an example of how the QSPEC can be 
   Used within QOS-NSLP. Figure A.4 illustrates a situation where a QNI 
   and a QNR are using an end to end QOSM, denoted in this context as Z-
   e2e. It is considered that the QNI access network side is a wireless 
   access network built on a generation "X" technology with QoS support 
   as defined by generation "X", while QNR access network is a 
   wired/fixed access network with its own defined QoS support. 
   Furthermore, it is considered that the shown QNE edges are located at 
   the boundary of a RMD domain and that the shown QNE Interior nodes 
   are located inside the RMD domain.
   The QNE edges are able to run both the Z-e2e QOSM and the RMD-QOSM, 
   while the QNE interior nodes can only run the RMD-QOSM. The QNI that 
   is considered to e.g., be a wireless laptop, while the QNR a PC.

       Figure A.4. Example of Initiator & Local Domain QOSM Operation


   The QNI sets QoS Desired and QoS Available QSPEC objects in the
   initiator QSPEC, and initializes QoS Available to QoS Desired. In 
   this example, the <Minimum QoS> object is not populated. The QNI 
   populates QSPEC parameters to ensure correct treatment of its traffic 
   in domains down the path. Additionally, to ensure correct treatment 
   further down the path, the QNI includes <PHB Class> in <QoS Desired>.  
   The QNI therefore includes in the QSPEC

Bader, et al.                                                [Page 108]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

     QoS Desired = <TMOD> <PHB Class>
     QoS Available = <TMOD> <Path Latency>

   In this example it is assumed that the <TMOD> parameter is used to
   encode the traffic parameters of a VoIP application that uses RTP and
   the G.711 Codec, see Appendix B in [QSP-T].
   The below text is copied from [QSP-T].

   "In the simplest case the Minimum Policed Unit m is the sum of the
   IP-, UDP- and RTP- headers + payload. The IP header in the IPv4 case
   has a size of 20 octets (40 octets if IPv6 is used). The UDP header
   has a size of 8 octets and RTP uses a 12 octet header. The G.711
   Codec specifies a bandwidth of 64 kbit/s (8000 octets/s). Assuming
   RTP transmits voice datagrams every 20ms, the payload for one
   datagram is 8000 octets/s * 0.02 s = 160 octets.

   IPv4+UDP+RTP+payload: m=20+8+12+160 octets = 200 octets
   IPv6+UDP+RTP+payload: m=40+8+12+160 octets = 220 octets

   The Rate r specifies the amount of octets per second. 50 datagrams
   Are sent per second.

   IPv4: r = 50 1/s * m = 10,000 octets/s
   IPv6: r = 50 1/s * m = 11,000 octets/s

   The bucket size b specifies the maximum burst. In this example a
   burst of 10 packets is used.

   IPv4: b = 10 * m = 2000 octets
   IPv6: b = 10 * m = 2200 octets ", from [QSP-T].

   In our example we will assume that IPV4 is used and therefore, the
   <TMOD-1> values will be set as follows:

   m = 200 octets
   r = 10000 octets/s
   b = 2000 octets

   The Peak Data Rate-1 (p) and MPS are not specified above, but in our
   example we will assume:

   p = r = 10000 octets/s
   MPS = 220 octets.

   The <PHB Class> is set in such a way that the Expedited Forwarding
   (EF) PHB is used.
   Since <Path Latency> and <QoS Class> are not vital parameters from
   the QNI's perspective, it does not raise their M flags.

   Each QNE, which supports the Z-e2e QOSM on the path, reads and
   interprets those parameters in the initiator QSPEC.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM

   When an end-to-end RESERVE message is received at a QNE Ingress node
   at the RMD domain border then the QNE ingress can 'hide' the 
   initiator end-to-end RESERVE message so that only the QNE edges 
   process the initiator (end-to-end) RESERVE message, which then 
   bypasses intermediate nodes between the edges of the domain, and 
   issues its own local RESERVE message (see Section 6).  For this new 
   local RESERVE message, the QNE Ingress node generates the local RMD-
   QSpec. The RMD-QSpec corresponding to the RMD-QOSM is generated based 
   on the original initiator QSPEC according to the procedures described 
   in Section 4.5 of [QoS-NSLP] and in Section 6 of this draft.  The RMD 
   QNE ingress maps the <TMOD-1> parameters contained in the original 
   Initiator QSPEC into the equivalent <TMOD-1> parameter representing 
   only the peak bandwidth in the local RMD-QSpec.
   In this example the initial <TMOD-1> parameters are mapped into the
   RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameters as follows.

   As specified the RMD-QOSM bandwidth equivalent <TMOD-1> parameter of
   RMD-QSpec should have:

      r = p of initial e2e <TMOD-1> parameter
      m = large;
      b = large;

   For the RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> parameter the following values are
   calculated:

      r = p of initial e2e <TMOD-1> parameter = 10000 octets/s
      m is set in this example to large as follows:
      m = MPS of initial e2e <TMOD-1> parameter = 220 octets

   The maximum value of b = 250 Gbytes, but in our example this value is
   quite large. The b parameter specifies the extent to which the data 
   rate can exceed the sustainable level for short periods of time.
   In order to get a large b, in this example we consider that for a
   period of certain period of time the data rate can exceed the
   sustainable level, which in our example is the peak rate (p).

   Thus in our example we calculate b as:

      b = p * "period of time".

   For this VoIP example, we can assume that this period of time is 1.5
   seconds, see below:

      b = 10000 octets/s * 1.5 seconds = 15000 octets

   Thus the local RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> values are:

      r = 10000 octets/s
      p = 10000 octets/s
      m = 220 octets
      b = 15000 octets
      MPS = 220 octets

INTERNET-DRAFT                                                 RMD-QOSM


   The bit level format of the RMD-QSpec is given in Section 4.1. In
   particular, The Initiator/Local QSPEC bit, i.e., <I> is set to 
   "Local" (i.e., "1") and the <Qspec Proc> is set as follows:
     * Message Sequence = 0: Sender initiated
     * Object combination = 0: <QoS Desired> for RESERVE and
       <QoS Reserved> for RESPONSE

   The <QSPEC Version> used by RMD-QOSM is the default version, i.e.,
   "0", see [QSP-T]. The <QSPEC Type> value used by the RMD-QOSM is
   specified in [QSP-T] and is equal to: "2".
   The <Traffic Handling Directives> contains the following fields:

   <Traffic Handling Directives> = <PHR container> <PDR container>

   The Per Hop Reservation container (PHR container) and
   the Per Domain Reservation container (PDR container) are specified
   in Section 4.1.2 and 4.1.3, respectively. The <PHR container>
   contains the traffic handling directives for intra-domain
   communication and reservation. The <PDR container> contains
   additional traffic handling directives that is needed for
   edge-to-edge communication. The RMD-QOSM <QoS Desired> and
   <QoS Reserved>, are specified in Section 4.1.1.
   In RMD-QOSM the <QoS Desired> and <QoS Reserved> objects contain the
   following parameters:

   <QoS Desired> = <TMOD-1> <PHB Class> <Admission Priority>
   <QoS Reserved> = <TMOD-1> <PHB Class> <Admission Priority>

   The bit format of the <PHB Class> (see [QSP-T] and Figure 4 and
   Figure 5) and <Admission Priority> complies to the bit format
   specified in [QSP-T].

   In this example the RMD-QSpec <TMOD-1> values are the ones that were 
   calculated and given above. Furthermore, the <PHB Class>, is 
   representing the EF PHB class. Moreover, in this example the RMD 
   reservation is established without an <Admission Priority> parameter, 
   which is equivalent to a reservation established with an <Admission 
   Priority> whose value is 1.

   The RMD QNE egress node updates QoS Available on behalf of the entire
   RMD domain if it can.  If it cannot (since the M flag is not set for
   <Path Latency>) it raises the parameter-specific, 'not-supported'
   flag, warning the QNR that the final latency value in QoS Available 
   is imprecise.

   In the "Y" access domain, the initiator QSPEC is processed by the QNR
   in the similar was as it was processed in the "X" wireless access
   domain, by the QNI.

   If the reservation was successful, eventually the RESERVE request 
   arrives at the QNR (otherwise the QNE at which the reservation failed 
   would have aborted the RESERVE and sent an error RESPONSE back to the 
   QNI).  If the RII was included in the QoS NSLP message, the QNR 
   generates a positive RESPONSE with QSPEC objects QoS Reserved and QoS 
   Available.  The parameters appearing in QoS Reserved are the same as 
   in QoS Desired, with values copied from QoS Available. Hence, the QNR 
   includes the following QSPEC objects in the RESPONSE:

    QoS Reserved = <TMOD> <PHB Class>
    QoS Available = <TMOD> <Path Latency>
