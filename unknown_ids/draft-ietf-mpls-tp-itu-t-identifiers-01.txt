            MPLS-TP Identifiers Following ITU-T Conventions
                draft-ietf-mpls-tp-itu-t-identifiers-01

Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to the identifiers to be used in
   the Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP).
   Identifiers that follow IP/MPLS conventions have already been
   defined.  This memo augments that set of identifiers for MPLS-TP
   management and OAM functions to include identifier information in a
   format typically used by the ITU-T.

Internet-Draft              MPLS-TP ITU-T IDs               October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document augments the initial set of identifiers to be used in
   the Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP)
   specified in RFC 6370 [RFC6370].

   RFC 6370 [RFC6370] defines a set of MPLS-TP transport and management
   entity identifiers to support bidirectional (co-routed and
   associated) point-to-point MPLS-TP LSPs, including PWs and Sections
   which follow the IP/MPLS conventions.

   This document specifies an alternative way to uniquely identify an
   operator/service provider based on ITU-T conventions and specifies
   how this operator/service provider identifier can be used to make the
   existing set of MPLS-TP transport and management entity identifiers,
   defined by RFC 6370 [RFC6370], globally unique.

   This document solely defines those identifiers.  Their use and
   possible protocols extensions to carry them is out of scope in this
   document.

   In this document, we follow the notational convention laid out in RFC
   6370 [RFC6370].

1.2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Uniquely Identifying an Operator - the ICC_Operator_ID

   In RFC 6370 [RFC6370] an operator is uniquely identified by the
   Global_ID which is based on the AS number of the operator.  The ITU-T
   however traditionally identifies operators/service providers based on
   the ITU-T Carrier Code (ICC) as specified in [M1400].

   The ITU-T Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB) maintains a
   list of assigned ICCs [ICC-list].  Note that ICCs can be assigned to
   both, ITU-T members as well as non-members, all of which are
   referenced at [ICC-list].  The national regulatory authorities act as
   an intermediary between the ITU/TSB and operators/service providers.
   Amongst the things that the national authorities are responsible for
   in the process of assigning an ICC is to ensure that the Carrier
   Codes are unique within their country.

   The ICC itself is a string of one to six characters, each character
   being either alphabetic (i.e.  A-Z) or numeric (i.e. 0-9).
   Alphabetic characters in the ICC SHOULD be represented with upper
   case letters.

   Global uniqueness is assured by concatenating the ICC with a Country
   Code (CC).  The Country Code (alpha-2) is a string of two alphabetic
   characters represented with upper case letters (i.e., A-Z).  The
   Country Code format is defined in ISO 3166-1 [ISO3166-1].  Together,
   the CC and the ICC form the ICC_Operator_ID as CC::ICC.


3.  Use of the ICC_Operator_ID

   The ICC_Operator_ID is used as a replacement for the Global_ID as
   specified in RFC 6370 [RFC6370], i.e. its purpose is to provide a
   globally unique context for other MPLS-TP identifiers.

   As an example, an Interface Identifier (IF_ID) in RFC 6370 [RFC6370]
   is specified as the concatenation of the Node_ID (a unique 32-bit
   value assigned by the operator) and the Interface Number (IF_Num, a
   32-bit unsigned integer assigned by the operator that is unique
   within the scope of a Node_ID).  To make this IF_ID globally unique
   the Global_ID is prefixed.  This memo specifies the ICC_Operator_ID
   as an alternative format which, just like the Global_ID, is prefixed

   to the IF_ID.  Using the notation from RFC 6370 [RFC6370]:

   Global_ID::Node_ID::IF_Num

   is functionally equivalent to:

   ICC_Operator_ID::Node_ID::IF_Num

   The same substitution procedure applies to all identifiers specified
   in RFC 6370 [RFC6370] except for the other alternatives mentioned in
   this document.


4.  ICC_Operator_ID-based MEG Identifiers

   The ITU-T format of MEG_IDs for MPLS-TP Sections, LSPs and
   Pseudowires is based on the globally unique ICC_Operator_ID.  In this
   case, the MEG_ID is a string of up to 15 characters.  It consists of
   three subfields: the Country Code (as described in Section 2), the
   ICC (as described in Section 2) which together form the
   ICC_Operator_ID, followed by a Unique MEG ID Code (UMC).

   The resulting MEG_ID therefore looks like the following:

   CC:ICC:UMC

   To avoid the potential for a short (i.e. less than 6 Character) ICC
   code in combination with a UMC not being unique the UMC MUST start
   with a special character that is not allowed in the ICC such as the
   "/" character.  A side effect of this is that the MEG_ID can be
   decomposed into its individual components by a receiver.

   The UMC MUST be unique within the organization identified by the
   combination of CC and ICC.

   The ICC_Operator_ID-based MEG_ID may be applied equally to a single
   MPLS-TP Section, LSP or Pseudowire.


5.  ICC_Operator_ID-based MEP Identifiers

   ICC_Operator_ID-based MEP_IDs for MPLS-TP LSPs and Pseudowires are
   formed by appending a 16-bit index to the MEG_ID defined in Section 4
   above.  Within the context of a particular MEG, we call the
   identifier associated with a MEP the MEP Index (MEP_Index).  The
   MEP_Index is administratively assigned.  It is encoded as a 16-bit
   unsigned integer and MUST be unique within the MEG.  An
   ICC_Operator_ID-based MEP_ID is structured as:

   MEG_ID::MEP_Index

   An ICC_Operator_ID-based MEP ID is globally unique by construction
   given the ICC_Operator_ID-based MEG_ID's global uniqueness.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document extends an existing information model and, as such,
   does in itself not introduce new security concerns.  But, as
   mentioned in the security considerations section of the document that
   is being augmented, protocol specifications that describe use of this
   information model may introduce security risks and concerns about
   authentication of participants.  For this reason, these protocol
   specifications need to describe security and authentication concerns
   that may be raised by the particular mechanisms defined and how those
   concerns may be addressed.


7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA actions resulting from this document.
