1.  Introduction

   The karp (Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols) working
   group aims to secure the packets on the wire of the routing protocol
   exchanges.  This work has been divided into two phases, (1) Enhance
   the routing protocol's current authentication mechanism; (2) Develop
   an automated keying framework [ietf-karp-design-guide].  Currently,
   there are a variety of routing protocols.  Many routing protocols (or
   groups of protocols) have already defined security association (SA)
   for cryptographic message authentication and integrity protection,
   which are listed in the appendix.  SA is the basis for protecting the
   packet of routing protocol; it may also affect the design of key
   management protocol (KMP) and framework of the karp.  As a start, it
   is desirable to analyze existing security associations of routing
   protocols.

   The main idea of this document is as follows:

   (1) Briefly overview of existing SA of routing protocols.

   (2) Compare those typical fields in routing protocol SA one by one,
   and identify potential issues.

   (3) Discuss the possible methods for that problem.

2.  Analysis of security associations for current routing protocols

   This section considers the security associations of the following
   routing protocols: RIPv2, OSPFv2, ISIS, BFD, and BGP.

   Note: Maybe there are lacks of commonly accepted term - BGP SA.  This
   document regards Master Key Tuple (MKT) in TCP-AO
   [ietf-tcpm-tcp-auth-opt] as BGP SA.

2.1.  Summary for security associations of current routing protocol

   The security associations of current routing protocol are summarized
   as follows:

   -The RIPv2 SA [RFC4822] includes the following information: key
   identifier, cryptographic algorithms, key length, sequence number,
   and life time of SA.

   -The OSPFv2 SA [RFC5709] includes the following information: key
   identifier, cryptographic algorithms, key length, and life time of
   SA.

   -The ISIS SA [RFC5310] includes the following information: key
   identifier, cryptographic algorithms, key length.

   -The BFD SA [draft-bhatia-bfd-crypto-auth] includes the following
   information: key identifier, cryptographic algorithms, key
   identifier.

   -The BGP SA [ietf-tcpm-tcp-auth-opt] includes the following
   information: key identifier, cryptographic algorithms, master key,
   key derivation function (KDF), sequence number, etc.

   The details of these SAs are listed in the appendix.

2.2.  Analysis of security associations of current routing protocol

   The fields in the above security associations are analyzed as
   follows:

   - Key identifier: Key identifier (Key ID) is used to uniquely
   identify a SA.  All SAs used in routing protocols specify this field.
   For example, OSPFv2 SA defines Key Identifier field to identify an
   OSPF SA.

                ---------------|-----------------|-------------------
                | RIPv2        |  Key Identifier | 8 bits           |
                ---------------|-----------------|-------------------
                | OSPFv2       |  Key Identifier | 8 bits           |
                ---------------|-----------------|-------------------
                | ISIS         |  Key Identifier | 2 octets         |
                ---------------|-----------------|-------------------
                | BFD          |  Authentication | 2 octets         |
                |              |  Key Identifier |                  |
                ---------------|-----------------|-------------------
                | BGP          |  KeyID          | 8 bits           |
                +--------------\-----------------\------------------+

   The key identifier maybe manually be configured or generated by
   automated key management protocol (KMP) which is one ongoing work in
   karp.  One obvious distinction among these routing protocols' SA is
   that the length of key ID is different.  If KMP generates key ID
   according to specific routing protocol, the design of KMP will be
   complex and bound to underlying routing protocol.

   - Cryptographic algorithms and key: For the purpose of authentication
   and integrity protection, the algorithm and key are used to produce
   message authentication code (MAC), which is used to protect the
   packet on the wire.  Typically, key length is related to a specific
   algorithm.

        +----------------\-------------------\-----------------------------+

   The cryptographic algorithms used in routing protocol are almost the
   same except for the protection of BGP, which is based on TCP-AO.
   This case also shows that manual configuration or KMP are also
   required to differentiate underlying routing protocol, which makes
   them complex.

   - Lifetime: It specifies whether the SA is valid or not.  For
   example, OSPFv2 SA [RFC5709] uses four fields (Key Start Accept, Key
   Start Generate, Key Stop Generate, Key Stop Accept) to control the
   lifetime of the SA.

   It can be seen that some routing protocols' SA define lifetime,
   others do not.  This implies that underlying routing protocol does
   not exhibit unified interface to upper layer.  In some cases, a
   rekeying mechanism is used to trigger the lifetime of SA.  However,
   current routing protocol SA does not specify what to do when the key
   expires.

   -Sequence number: Sequence number is typically defined to avoid
   replay attacks.

   The length of sequence number above is 32 bits, which is convenient
   to the manual configuration or KMP because it is unrelated to
   underlying routing protocol.

2.3.  Discussion of generic security association

   As shown in section 2.2, the definition and its value of SA is
   different for each routing protocol.  This document just covers part
   of routing protocol.  Some other routing protocols such as OSPFv3,
   RIPng depends on the protection of IPsec SA [RFC4301].  If this case
   is taken into consideration, the differences among these SAs are more
   bigger.  It is required to consider the diversity of routing protocol
   SA when starting the karp's work.  Here are two possible ways to deal
   with this issue.

   (1) Each routing protocol (or category) has its own specific manual
   configuration or KMP.  The advantage is that it can be implemented
   easily and straightforwardly.  The disadvantage is obvious: The
   system is complex and cumbersome because there exist a dozen of
   routing protocols.  In this case, the karp's work seems complicated.

   (2)A generic SA (gSA) is introduced to hide the diversity of
   underlying routing protocol SA.  It can be regarded as abstract
   layer; it is a bridge between manual configuration or KMP protocol
   and routing protocol.  The advantages are as follows: (1)It provides
   a unified interface to manual configuration or KMP protocol. (2)It
   decouples KMP with underlying routing protocol, which addresses the
   requirement identified in [I-D.ietf-karp-threats-req]. (3)KMP and
   routing protocol can be evolved independently. (4)The complexity of
   the design of KMP is greatly reduced.  The disadvantage of this
   method may be that a new layer is added, which produces extra cost.

5.  appendix: Existing SA definition

   This section is for information.  It can be safely removed in the
   future.

5.1.  RIPv2 SA

   RIPv2 Security Association:[RFC4822]

   KEY-IDENTIFIER (KEY-ID) - The unsigned 8-bit KEY-ID value is used to
   identify the RIPv2 Security Association in use for this packet.

   AUTHENTICATION ALGORITHM - This specifies the cryptographic algorithm
   and algorithm mode used with the RIPv2 Security Association.

   AUTHENTICATION KEY - This is the value of the cryptographic
   authentication key used with the associated Authentication Algorithm.

   SEQUENCE NUMBER - This is an unsigned 32-bit number.

   START TIME - This is a local representation of the day and time that
   this Security Association first becomes valid.

   STOP TIME - This is a local representation of the day and time that
   this Security Association becomes invalid

5.2.  OSPFv2 SA

   OSPFv2 Security Association: [RFC5709]

   Key Identifier (KeyID) - This is an 8-bit unsigned value used to
   uniquely identify an OSPFv2 SA and is configured either by the router
   administrator (or, in the future, possibly by some key management
   protocol specified by the IETF).  The receiver uses this to locate
   the appropriate OSPFv2 SA to use.  The sender puts this KeyID value
   in the OSPF packet based on the active OSPF configuration.

   Authentication Algorithm - This indicates the authentication
   algorithm (and also the cryptographic mode, such as HMAC) to be used.
   This information SHOULD never be sent over the wire in cleartext
   form.  At present, valid values are Keyed-MD5, HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-
   256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512.

   Authentication Key - This is the cryptographic key used for
   cryptographic authentication with this OSPFv2 SA.

   Key Start Accept - The time that this OSPF router will accept packets
   that have been created with this OSPF Security Association.

   Key Start Generate - The time that this OSPF router will begin using
   this OSPF Security Association for OSPF packet generation.

   Key Stop Generate - The time that this OSPF router will stop using
   this OSPF Security Association for OSPF packet generation.

   Key Stop Accept - The time that this OSPF router will stop accepting
   packets generated with this OSPF Security Association.

5.3.  ISIS SA

   An IS-IS Security Association contains a set of parameters shared
   between any two legitimate IS-IS speakers.  Parameters associated
   with an IS-IS SA: [RFC5310]

   Key Identifier (Key ID) - This is a two-octet unsigned integer used
   to uniquely identify an IS-IS SA, as manually configured by the
   network operator.  The receiver determines the active SA by looking
   at the Key ID field in the incoming PDU.  The sender, based on the
   active configuration, selects the Security Association to use and
   puts the correct Key ID value associated with the Security
   Association in the IS-IS PDU.  If multiple valid and active IS-IS
   Security Associations exist for a given outbound interface at the
   time an IS-IS PDU is sent, the sender may use any of those Security
   Associations to protect the packet.

   Authentication Algorithm - This signifies the authentication
   algorithm to be used with the IS-IS SA.  At present, the following
   values are possible: HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-224, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-
   SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512.

   Authentication Key - This value denotes the cryptographic
   authentication key associated with the IS-IS SA.  The length of this
   key is variable and depends upon the authentication algorithm
   specified by the IS-IS SA.

5.4.  BFD SA

   The BFD protocol does not include an in-band mechanism to create or
   manage BFD Security Associations (BFD SA).  A BFD SA contains a set
   of shared parameters between any two legitimate BFD routers.
   Parameters associated with a BFD SA: [draft-bhatia-bfd-crypto-auth]

   Authentication Key Identifier (Key ID) - This is a two octet unsigned
   integer used to uniquely identify the BFD SA, as manually configured
   by the network operator (or, in the future, possibly by some key
   management protocol specified by the IETF).  The receiver determines
   the active SA by looking at this field in the incoming packet.  The

   sender puts this Key ID in the BFD packet based on the active
   configuration.

   Authentication Algorithm - This indicates the authentication
   algorithm to be used with the BFD SA.  The following values are
   possible: Keyed MD5, Keyed SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-
   384 and HMAC-SHA-512.

   Authentication Key - This indicates the cryptographic key associated
   with this BFD SA.  The length of this key is variable and depends
   upon the authentication algorithm specified by the BFD SA.

5.5.  TCP-AO

   A Master Key Tuple (MKT) describes TCP-AO properties to be associated
   with one or more connections.  It is composed of the following:
   [ietf-tcpm-tcp-auth-opt]

   IDs - The values used in the KeyID or RNextKeyID of a TCP-AO option;
   used to differentiate MKTs in concurrent use (KeyID), as well as to
   indicate when MKTs are ready for use in the opposite direction
   (RNextKeyID).  Each MKT has two IDs - a SendID and a RecvID.  The
   SendID is inserted as the KeyID of the TCP-OP option of outgoing
   segments, and the RecvID is matched against the KeyID of the TCP-AO
   option of incoming segments.  MKT IDs MUST support any value, 0-255
   inclusive.  There are no reserved ID values.

   Master key - A byte sequence used for generating traffic keys, this
   may be derived from a separate shared key by an external protocol
   over a separate channel.

   Implementations are advised to keep master key values in a private,
   protected area of memory or other storage.

   Key Derivation Function (KDF) - Indicates the key derivation function
   and its parameters, as used to generate traffic keys from master
   keys.

   Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm - Indicates the MAC
   algorithm and its parameters as used for this connection.
