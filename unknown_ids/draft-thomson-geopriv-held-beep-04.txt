Internet-Draft               HELD over BEEP                 January 2009


1.  Introduction

   The HTTP binding for HELD [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery]
   provides a basis for the protocol, which does not encumber
   implementations with a complex protocol stack.  However, some
   applications require that a requester make multiple requests in
   parallel to a Location Information Server (LIS).  Where a requester
   is able to retrieve location information for large numbers of
   Targets, a more efficient protocol is useful.  In these
   circumstances, relying on HTTP is suboptimal.

   The HTTP binding is not suitable in volume scenarios because HTTP
   suffers from head-of-queue blocking.  This prevents multiple requests
   from being processed in parallel.  In order to achieve higher
   throughput, the requester must establish multiple TCP connections in
   parallel.  This causes HTTP to be unsuitable for applications where
   multiple parallel requests are expected by increasing the overheads.

   BEEP [RFC3080] provides a framing scheme that allows for parallel
   requests.  BEEP uses MIME [RFC2045] for its messages, which means
   that no significant modifications are required to carry HELD
   messages.  This document describes a BEEP profile for HELD.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document covers the use of HELD as a location configuration
   protocol and a location dereference protocol (see
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements]).  For simplicity, the term
   Location Information Server (LIS) is used to refer to the server role
   for both protocols.  LIS in place of Location Server (LS), which is
   the more correct term for the location dereference protocol.

2.  The HELD BEEP Profile

   The BEEP profile for HELD is identified using the URN:

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:beep

   This identifier is used in the BEEP "profile" element during channel
   creation.

   The HELD channel is a simple continuous channel that does not require
   any state information.  Requests and their respective responses are
   always in the request-response form ("MSG"/"RPY").

Internet-Draft               HELD over BEEP                 January 2009


2.1.  Channel Initialization

   The HELD profile is started with a single "profile" request.  No
   additional parameters are required.  When initiating a channel the
   "profile" element is empty, as shown in the example below.

     <start number="1">
       <profile uri="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:beep"/>
     </start>

   Similarly, the response to channel initialization is empty.

     <profile uri="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:beep"/>

2.2.  Message Exchange Pattern

   The BEEP binding for HELD requires only the "MSG"/"RPY" message
   exchange.  Each "MSG" frame contains a HELD request; for example a
   "locationRequest".  Each "RPY" frame includes a response; for
   example, a "locationResponse".

   The following exchange demonstrates how a simple HELD location
   request and response are encapsulated.  The "C:" and "S:" prefixes on
   lines are used following the convention in [RFC3080].

   C: MSG 1 7 . 544 125
   C: Content-Type: application/held+xml
   C:
   C: <?xml version="1.0"?>
   C: <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held"/>
   C: END
   S: RPY 1 7 . 1902 695
   S: Content-Type: application/held+xml
   S:
   S: <?xml version="1.0"?>
   S: <locationResponse xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
   S:   <!-- PIDF-LO contents not shown -->
   S: </locationResponse>
   S: END

2.3.  Error Handling

   Consistent with the HTTP binding, the BEEP binding for HELD does not
   use the "ERR" message to indicate errors at the HELD protocol level.
   Errors in handling HELD Requests are indicated to the requester in a
   "RPY" message.

   Errors in the BEEP message that are unrelated to the HELD protocol,



Thomson & Winterbottom    Expires July 18, 2009                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               HELD over BEEP                 January 2009


   such as MIME formatting problems, are indicated using the BEEP "ERR"
   message.  This "ERR" message MAY either be empty or it could include
   textual feedback.

2.4.  Asynchronous Message Exchange

   A HELD request can take varying amounts of time to process.  The
   "responseTime" attribute in HELD is used to indicate an upper bound
   on this time.  BEEP channels are serial in nature and BEEP mandates
   that the serving peer process requests in order.  With these
   constraints, in order to achieve any substantial throughput, multiple
   BEEP channels would be necessary.  This approach does not scale well
   for larger numbers of requests as response times increase.

   It is RECOMMENDED that for HELD on BEEP that both peers use
   asynchronous BEEP channels [I-D.thomson-beep-async].  Asynchronous
   BEEP enables the use of a single channel for multiple requests
   without constraints on how requests are processed or on the order of
   responses.  Asynchronous BEEP greatly increases the potential
   throughput of a channel, particularly for profiles like HELD that
   could have widely varying response times.  Without asynchronous BEEP,
   multiple channels MAY be used to increase throughput.

3.  Location Dereference and the BEEP Binding

   The HELD BEEP binding can be used for dereferencing of location URIs
   ([I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements],
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-deref-protocol]).  A location URI is
   indicated in a "Request-URI" MIME header of the BEEP "MSG" frame.

   The "Request-URI" header includes an absolute path and optional query
   components.  The folloring using ABNF [RFC5234] shows the format of
   the "Request-URI" header:

   Request-URI-Header = "Request-URI" ":" ( absolute-URI / "*" )
                        ; absolute-URI from RFC 3986

   The "Request-URI" header includes an absolute URI [RFC3986].  The
   absolute URI indicates location URI that is being dereferenced, or
   the string "*".  A value of "*" indicates that the request is a
   location configuration protocol request (i.e. no location URI is
   being dereferenced).  The header MAY be omitted for a location
   configuration protocol request, and a value of "*" is inferred.

4.  Security Considerations

   TLS [RFC5246] MUST be used for HELD over BEEP unless confidentiality,
   message integrity and authentication are assured through other means



Thomson & Winterbottom    Expires July 18, 2009                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               HELD over BEEP                 January 2009


   (e.g. dedicated media).  Section 4.1 includes guidelines on
   authentication requirements.

4.1.  LIS Discovery and Authentication

   This profile is most suited to situations where a client and LIS
   exchange a large number of requests over a prolonged period.  It is
   anticipated that the client and LIS are known to each other.

   Based on this assumption, it is reasonable for the LIS and its
   clients to have pre-existing configuration that is used instead of a
   discovery process.  In addition, authentication details and methods
   can be pre-configured on both nodes.  Therefore, no protocol
   mechanisms are specified for arranging discovery and authentication
   for this profile.

   Regardless of the method used to determine the address of the LIS, a
   client MUST authenticate the LIS.  This prevents any LIS spoofing
   attacks that could be used to provide falsified information or to
   acquire information about the client (and in turn, their clients).
   Authentication for the case where HELD is used as a location
   configuration protocol is covered in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery].

   If this profile is used for dereferencing location URIs, the
   authenticated LIS identity MUST be used to determine whether the LIS
   is authorized to serve particular location URIs.  The client
   authenticates the LIS for each location URI.  Depending on the URI
   scheme, the LIS identity is validated against the URI.  If a LIS
   cannot be identified as authoritative for a particular URI, clients
   MUST NOT request information from that LIS for that URI.

   For location URIs that include a host name, such as "https:" or
   "pres:" URIs, the guidelines in Section 3.1 of [RFC2818] can be
   applied to determine if LIS identity matches the URI.

   It might also be necessary for the LIS to authenticate clients.  Some
   authorization decision is likely to be necessary in order for a
   client to initiate a large volume of requests, which could represent
   significant load on a LIS.

   This document does not mandate any specific authentication method;
   however, since TLS is required, the mandatory authentication methods
   for TLS are assumed to be present.  Alternative authentication
   methods can be negotiated between the LIS and its clients.
