                   Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET)
                    draft-templin-intarea-vet-27.txt

Abstract

   Enterprise networks connect hosts and routers over various link
   types, and often also connect to provider networks and/or the global
   Internet.  Enterprise network nodes require a means to automatically
   provision addresses/prefixes and support internetworking operation in
   a wide variety of use cases including Small Office, Home Office
   (SOHO) networks, Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), ISP networks,
   multi-organizational corporate networks and the interdomain core of
   the global Internet itself.  This document specifies a Virtual
   Enterprise Traversal (VET) abstraction for autoconfiguration and
   operation of nodes in enterprise networks.

1.  Introduction

   Enterprise networks [RFC4852] connect hosts and routers over various
   link types (see [RFC4861], Section 2.2).  The term "enterprise
   network" in this context extends to a wide variety of use cases and
   deployment scenarios.  For example, an "enterprise" can be as small
   as a Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) network, as complex as a multi-
   organizational corporation, or as large as the global Internet
   itself.  Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks are another example
   use case that fits well with the VET enterprise network model.
   Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) [RFC2501] can also be considered as a
   challenging example of an enterprise network, in that their
   topologies may change dynamically over time and that they may employ
   little/no active management by a centralized network administrative
   authority.  These specialized characteristics for MANETs require
   careful consideration, but the same principles apply equally to other
   enterprise network scenarios.

   This document specifies a Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET)
   abstraction for autoconfiguration and internetworking operation,
   where addresses of different scopes may be assigned on various types
   of interfaces with diverse properties.  Both IPv4/ICMPv4
   [RFC0791][RFC0792] and IPv6/ICMPv6 [RFC2460][RFC4443] are discussed
   within this context (other network layer protocols are also
   considered).  The use of standard DHCP [RFC2131] [RFC3315] is assumed
   unless otherwise specified.

               Figure 1: Enterprise Router (ER) Architecture

   Figure 1 above depicts the architectural model for an Enterprise
   Router (ER).  As shown in the figure, an ER may have a variety of
   interface types including enterprise-edge, enterprise-interior,
   provider-edge, internal-virtual, as well as VET interfaces used for
   encapsulating inner network layer protocol packets for transmission
   over outer IPv4 or IPv6 networks.  The different types of interfaces
   are defined, and the autoconfiguration mechanisms used for each type
   are specified.  This architecture applies equally for MANET routers,
   in which enterprise-interior interfaces typically correspond to the
   wireless multihop radio interfaces associated with MANETs.  Out of
   scope for this document is the autoconfiguration of provider
   interfaces, which must be coordinated in a manner specific to the
   service provider's network.

   The VET framework builds on a Non-Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA)
   [RFC2491] virtual interface model in a manner similar to other
   automatic tunneling technologies [RFC2529][RFC5214].  VET interfaces
   support the encapsulation of inner network layer protocol packets
   over IP networks (i.e., either IPv4 or IPv6), and provide an NBMA
   interface abstraction for coordination between tunnel endpoint

   "neighbors".  VET is also compatible with mid-layer encapsulation
   technologies including IPsec [RFC4301], and supports both stateful
   and stateless prefix delegation.

   VET and its associated technologies (including the Subnetwork
   Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) [I-D.templin-intarea-seal]
   and Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO) [I-D.templin-aero])
   are functional building blocks for a new Internetworking architecture
   known as the Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON)
   [I-D.templin-ironbis] and Routing and Addressing in Networks with
   Global Enterprise Recursion (RANGER) [RFC5720][RFC6139].  Many of the
   VET principles can be traced to the deliberations of the ROAD group
   in January 1992, and also to still earlier initiatives including
   NIMROD [RFC1753] and the Catenet model for internetworking [CATENET]
   [IEN48] [RFC2775].  The high-level architectural aspects of the ROAD
   group deliberations are captured in a "New Scheme for Internet
   Routing and Addressing (ENCAPS) for IPNG" [RFC1955].

   VET is related to the present-day activities of the IETF INTAREA,
   AUTOCONF, DHC, IPv6, MANET, RENUM and V6OPS working groups, as well
   as the IRTF RRG working group.


2.  Terminology

   The mechanisms within this document build upon the fundamental
   principles of IP encapsulation.  The term "inner" refers to the
   innermost {address, protocol, header, packet, etc.} *before*
   encapsulation, and the term "outer" refers to the outermost {address,
   protocol, header, packet, etc.} *after* encapsulation.  VET also
   accommodates "mid-layer" encapsulations including SEAL
   [I-D.templin-intarea-seal], IPsec [RFC4301], etc.

   The terminology in the normative references apply; the following
   terms are defined within the scope of this document:

   Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET)
      an abstraction that uses encapsulation to create virtual overlays
      for transporting inner network layer packets over outer IPv4 and
      IPv6 enterprise networks.

   enterprise network
      the same as defined in [RFC4852].  An enterprise network is
      further understood to refer to a cooperative networked collective
      of devices within a structured IP routing and addressing plan and
      with a commonality of business, social, political, etc.,
      interests.  Minimally, the only commonality of interest in some
      enterprise network scenarios may be the cooperative provisioning

      of connectivity itself.

   subnetwork
      the same as defined in [RFC3819].

   site
      a logical and/or physical grouping of interfaces that connect a
      topological area less than or equal to an enterprise network in
      scope.  From a network organizational standpoint, a site within an
      enterprise network can be considered as an enterprise network unto
      itself.

   Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET)
      a connected topology of mobile or fixed routers that maintain a
      routing structure among themselves over links that often have
      dynamic connectivity properties.  The characteristics of MANETs
      are described in [RFC2501], Section 3, and a wide variety of
      MANETs share common properties with enterprise networks.

   enterprise/site/MANET
      throughout the remainder of this document, the term "enterprise
      network" is used to collectively refer to any of {enterprise,
      site, MANET}, i.e., the VET mechanisms and operational principles
      can be applied to enterprises, sites, and MANETs of any size or
      shape.

   VET link
      a virtual link that uses automatic tunneling to create an overlay
      network that spans an enterprise network routing region.  VET
      links can be segmented (e.g., by filtering gateways) into multiple
      distinct segments that can be joined together by bridges or IP
      routers the same as for any link.  Bridging would view the
      multiple (bridged) segments as a single VET link, whereas IP
      routing would view the multiple segments as multiple distinct VET
      links.  VET links can further be partitioned into multiple logical
      areas, where each area is identified by a distinct set of border
      nodes.

      VET links configured over non-multicast enterprise networks
      support only Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) services; VET
      links configured over enterprise networks that support multicast
      can support both NBMA and native multicast services.  All nodes
      connected to the same VET link appear as neighbors from the
      standpoint of the inner network layer.

   Enterprise Router (ER)
      As depicted in Figure 1, an Enterprise Router (ER) is a fixed or
      mobile router that comprises a router function, a host function,
      one or more enterprise-interior interfaces, and zero or more
      internal virtual, enterprise-edge, provider-edge, and VET
      interfaces.  At a minimum, an ER forwards outer IP packets over
      one or more sets of enterprise-interior interfaces, where each set
      connects to a distinct enterprise network.

   VET Border Router (VBR)
      an ER that connects end user networks (EUNs) to VET links and/or
      connects multiple VET links together.  A VBR is a tunnel endpoint
      router, and it configures a separate VET interface for each
      distinct VET link.  All VBRs are also ERs.

   VET Border Gateway (VBG)
      a VBR that connects VET links to provider networks.  A VBG may
      alternately act as "half-gateway", and forward the packets it
      receives from neighbors on the VET link to another VBG on the same
      VET link.  All VBGs are also VBRs.

   VET host
      any node (host or router) that configures a VET interface for
      host-operation only.  Note that a node may configure some of its
      VET interfaces as host interfaces and others as router interfaces.

   VET node
      any node (host or router) that configures and uses a VET
      interface.

   enterprise-interior interface
      an ER's attachment to a link within an enterprise network.
      Packets sent over enterprise-interior interfaces may be forwarded
      over multiple additional enterprise-interior interfaces before
      they reach either their final destination or a border router/
      gateway.  Enterprise-interior interfaces connect laterally within
      the IP network hierarchy.

   enterprise-edge interface
      a VBR's attachment to a link (e.g., an Ethernet, a wireless
      personal area network, etc.) on an arbitrarily complex EUN that
      the VBR connects to a VET link and/or a provider network.
      Enterprise-edge interfaces connect to lower levels within the IP
      network hierarchy.

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


   provider-edge interface
      a VBR's attachment to the Internet or to a provider network via
      which the Internet can be reached.  Provider-edge interfaces
      connect to higher levels within the IP network hierarchy.

   internal-virtual interface
      an interface that is internal to a VET node and does not in itself
      directly attach to a tangible link, e.g., a loopback interface.

   VET interface
      a VET node's attachment to a VET link.  VET nodes configure each
      VET interface over a set of underlying enterprise-interior
      interfaces that connect to a routing region spanned by a single
      VET link.  When there are multiple distinct VET links (each with
      their own distinct set of underlying interfaces), the VET node
      configures a separate VET interface for each link.

      The VET interface encapsulates each inner packet in any mid-layer
      headers followed by an outer IP header, then forwards the packet
      on an underlying interface such that the Time to Live (TTL) - Hop
      Limit in the inner header is not decremented as the packet
      traverses the link.  The VET interface therefore presents an
      automatic tunneling abstraction that represents the VET link as a
      single hop to the inner network layer.

   Provider Aggregated (PA) prefix
      a network layer protocol prefix that is delegated to a VET node by
      a provider network.

   Virtually Aggregated (VA) prefix
      a network layer protocol prefix that is delegated to a VET node by
      a Virtual Service Provider (VSP) that may operate independently of
      the node's provider networks.  The term "Virtually Aggregated (VA)
      prefix" as used in this document is logically equivalent to the
      term "Client Prefix (CP)" as used in IRON [I-D.templin-ironbis].

   Provider Independent (PI) prefix
      a network layer protocol prefix that is delegated to a VET node by
      an independent registration authority.  The VET node then becomes
      solely responsible for representing the PI prefix into the global
      Internet routing system on its own behalf.

   Routing Locator (RLOC)
      a public-scope or enterprise-local-scope IP address that can
      appear in enterprise-interior and/or interdomain routing tables.
      Public-scope RLOCs are delegated to specific enterprise networks

      routing regions.  Enterprise-local-scope RLOCs (e.g., IPv6 Unique

      Local Addresses [RFC4193], IPv4 privacy addresses [RFC1918], etc.)
      are self-generated by individual enterprise networks and routable
      only within the enterprise-interior routing region.

      ERs use RLOCs for operating the enterprise-interior routing
      protocol and for next-hop determination in forwarding packets
      addressed to other RLOCs.  End systems can use RLOCs as addresses
      for end-to-end communications between peers within the same
      enterprise network.  VET interfaces treat RLOCs as *outer* IP
      addresses during encapsulation.

   Endpoint Interface iDentifier (EID)
      a public-scope network layer address that is routable within
      enterprise-edge and/or VET overlay networks.  In a pure mapping
      system, EID prefixes are not routable within the interdomain
      routing system.  In a hybrid routing/mapping system, EID prefixes
      may be represented within the same interdomain routing instances
      that distribute RLOC prefixes.  In either case, EID prefixes are
      separate and distinct from any RLOC prefix space, but they are
      mapped to RLOC addresses to support packet forwarding over VET
      interfaces.

      VBRs participate in any EID-based routing instances and use EID
      addresses for next-hop determination.  End systems can use EIDs as
      addresses for end-to-end communications between peers either
      within the same enterprise network or within different enterprise
      networks.  VET interfaces treat EIDs as *inner* network layer
      addresses during encapsulation.

      Note that an EID can also be used as an *outer* network layer
      address if there are nested encapsulations.  In that case, the EID
      would appear as an RLOC to the innermost encapsulation.

3.  Enterprise Network Characteristics

   Enterprise networks consist of links that are connected by Enterprise
   Routers (ERs) as depicted in Figure 1.  ERs typically participate in
   a routing protocol over enterprise-interior interfaces to discover
   routes that may include multiple Layer 2 or Layer 3 forwarding hops.
   VET Border Routers (VBRs) are ERs that connect End User Networks
   (EUNs) to VET links that span enterprise networks.  VET Border
   Gateways (VBGs) are VBRs that connect VET links to provider networks.

   Conceptually, an ER embodies both a host function and router
   function, and supports communications according to the weak end-
   system model [RFC1122].  The router function engages in the
   enterprise-interior routing protocol on its enterprise-interior
   interfaces, connects any of the ER's EUNs to its VET links, and may
   also connect the VET links to provider networks (see Figure 1).  The
   host function typically supports network management applications, but
   may also support diverse applications typically associated with
   general-purpose computing platforms.

   An enterprise network may be as simple as a small collection of ERs
   and their attached EUNs; an enterprise network may also contain other
   enterprise networks and/or be a subnetwork of a larger enterprise
   network.  An enterprise network may further encompass a set of branch
   offices and/or nomadic hosts connected to a home office over one or
   several service providers, e.g., through Virtual Private Network
   (VPN) tunnels.  Finally, an enterprise network may contain many
   internal partitions that are logical or physical groupings of nodes
   for the purpose of load balancing, organizational separation, etc.
   In that case, each internal partition resembles an individual segment
   of a bridged LAN.

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


   Enterprise networks that comprise link types with sufficiently
   similar properties (e.g., Layer 2 (L2) address formats, maximum
   transmission units (MTUs), etc.) can configure a subnetwork routing
   service such that the network layer sees the underlying network as an
   ordinary shared link the same as for a (bridged) campus LAN (this is
   often the case with large cellular operator networks).  In that case,
   a single network layer hop is sufficient to traverse the underlying
   network.  Enterprise networks that comprise link types with diverse
   properties and/or configure multiple IP subnets must also provide an
   enterprise-interior routing service that operates as an IP layer
   mechanism.  In that case, multiple network layer hops may be
   necessary to traverse the underlying network.

   In addition to other interface types, VET nodes configure VET
   interfaces that view all other nodes on the VET link as neighbors on
   a virtual NBMA link.  VET nodes configure a separate VET interface
   for each distinct VET link to which they connect, and discover
   neighbors on the link that can be used for forwarding packets to off-
   link destinations.  VET interface neighbor relationships may be
   either unidirectional or bidirectional.

   A unidirectional neighbor relationship is typically established and
   maintained as a result of network layer control protocol messaging in
   a manner that parallels IPv6 neighbor discovery [RFC4861].  A
   bidirectional neighbor relationship is typically established and
   maintained as result of a short transaction between the neighbors
   (see: Section 5.6.4).

   For each distinct VET link , a trust basis must be established and
   consistently applied.  For example, for VET links configured over
   enterprise networks in which VBRs establish symmetric security
   associations, mechanisms such as IPsec [RFC4301] can be used to
   assure authentication and confidentiality.  In other enterprise
   network scenarios, VET links may require asymmetric securing
   mechanisms such as SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971].  VET
   links configured over still other enterprise networks may find it
   sufficient to employ ancillary encapsulations (e.g., SEAL
   [I-D.templin-intarea-seal]) that include per-packet authentication
   and/or identification materials.

   Finally, for VET links configured over enterprise networks with a
   centralized management structure (e.g., a corporate campus network,
   an ISP network, etc.), a hybrid routing/mapping service can be
   deployed using a synchronized set of VBGs.  In that case, the VBGs
   can provide a "default mapper" [I-D.jen-apt] service used for short-
   term packet forwarding until route-optimized paths can be
   established.  For VET links configured over enterprise networks with
   a distributed management structure (e.g., disconnected MANETs), peer-

   to-peer coordination between the VET nodes themselves without the
   assistance of VBGs may be required.  Recognizing that various use
   cases may entail a continuum between a fully centralized and fully
   distributed approach, the following sections present the mechanisms
   of Virtual Enterprise Traversal as they apply to a wide variety of
   scenarios.


4.  Autoconfiguration

   ERs, VBRs, VBGs, and VET hosts configure themselves for operation as
   specified in the following subsections.

4.1.  Enterprise Router (ER) Autoconfiguration

   ERs configure enterprise-interior interfaces and engage in any
   routing protocols over those interfaces.

   When an ER joins an enterprise network, it first configures an IPv6
   link-local address on each enterprise-interior interface that
   requires an IPv6 link-local capability and configures an IPv4 link-
   local address on each enterprise-interior interface that requires an
   IPv4 link-local capability.  IPv6 link-local address generation
   mechanisms include Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs)
   [RFC3972], IPv6 Privacy Addresses [RFC4941], StateLess Address
   AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) using EUI-64 interface identifiers
   [RFC4291] [RFC4862], etc.  The mechanisms specified in [RFC3927]
   provide an IPv4 link-local address generation capability.

   Next, the ER configures one or more RLOCs and engages in any routing
   protocols on its enterprise-interior interfaces.  The ER can
   configure RLOCs via administrative configuration, pseudo-random self-
   generation from a suitably large address pool, SLAAC, DHCP
   autoconfiguration, or through an alternate autoconfiguration
   mechanism.

   Pseudo-random self-generation of IPv6 RLOCs can be from a large
   public or local-use IPv6 address range (e.g., IPv6 Unique Local
   Addresses [RFC4193]).  Pseudo-random self-generation of IPv4 RLOCs
   can be from a large public or local-use IPv4 address range (e.g.,
   [RFC1918]).  When self-generation is used alone, the ER continuously
   monitors the RLOCs for uniqueness, e.g., by monitoring the
   enterprise-interior routing protocol.  (Note however that anycast
   RLOCs may be assigned to multiple enterprise-interior interfaces;
   hence, monitoring for uniqueness applies only to RLOCs that are
   provisioned as unicast.)

   SLAAC autoconfiguration of RLOCs can be through the receipt of IPv6



Templin                  Expires April 21, 2012                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


   Router Advertisements (RAs) followed by the stateless configuration
   of addresses based on any included Prefix Information Options (PIOs)
   [RFC4861][RFC4862].

   DHCP autoconfiguration of RLOCs uses standard DHCP procedures,
   however ERs acting as DHCP clients SHOULD also use DHCP
   Authentication [RFC3118] [RFC3315] as discussed further below.  In
   typical enterprise network scenarios (i.e., those with stable links),
   it may be sufficient to configure one or a few DHCP relays on each
   link that does not include a DHCP server.  In more extreme scenarios
   (e.g., MANETs that include links with dynamic connectivity
   properties), DHCP operation may require any ERs that have already
   configured RLOCs to act as DHCP relays to ensure that client DHCP
   requests eventually reach a DHCP server.  This may result in
   considerable DHCP message relaying until a server is located, but the
   DHCP Authentication Replay Detection vector provides relays with a
   means for avoiding message duplication.

   In all enterprise network scenarios, the amount of DHCP relaying
   required can be significantly reduced if each relay has a way of
   contacting a DHCP server directly.  In particular, if the relay can
   discover the unicast addresses for one or more servers (e.g., by
   discovering the unicast RLOC addresses of VBGs as described in
   Section 4.2.2) it can forward DHCP requests directly to the unicast
   address(es) of the server(s).  If the relay does not know the unicast
   address of a server, it can forward DHCP requests to a site-scoped
   DHCP server multicast address if the enterprise network supports
   site-scoped multicast services.  For DHCPv6, relays can forward
   requests to the site-scoped IPv6 multicast group address
   'All_DHCP_Servers' [RFC3315].  For DHCPv4, relays can forward
   requests to the site-scoped IPv4 multicast group address
   'All_DHCPv4_Servers', which SHOULD be set to 239.255.2.1 unless an
   alternate multicast group for the enterprise network is known.
   DHCPv4 servers that delegate RLOCs SHOULD therefore join the
   'All_DHCPv4_Servers' multicast group and service any DHCPv4 messages
   received for that group.

   A combined approach using both DHCP and self-generation is also
   possible when the ER configures both a DHCP client and relay that are
   connected, e.g., via a pair of back-to-back connected Ethernet
   interfaces, a tun/tap interface, a loopback interface, inter-process
   communication, etc.  The ER first self-generates an RLOC taken from a
   temporary addressing range used only for the bootstrapping purpose of
   procuring an actual RLOC taken from a delegated addressing range.
   The ER then engages in the enterprise-interior routing protocol and
   performs a DHCP exchange as above using the temporary RLOC as the
   address of its relay function.  When the DHCP server delegates an
   actual RLOC address/prefix, the ER abandons the temporary RLOC and

   re-engages in the enterprise-interior routing protocol using an RLOC
   taken from the delegation.

   Alternatively (or in addition to the above), the ER can request RLOC
   prefix delegations via an automated prefix delegation exchange over
   an enterprise-interior interface and can assign the prefix(es) on
   enterprise-edge interfaces.  Note that in some cases, the same
   enterprise-edge interfaces may assign both RLOC and EID addresses if
   there is a means for source address selection.  In other cases (e.g.,
   for separation of security domains), RLOCs and EIDs are assigned on
   separate sets of enterprise-edge interfaces.

   In some enterprise network scenarios (e.g., MANETs that include links
   with dynamic connectivity properties), assignment of RLOCs on
   enterprise-interior interfaces as singleton addresses (i.e., as
   addresses with /32 prefix lengths for IPv4, or as addresses with /128
   prefix lengths for IPv6) MAY be necessary to avoid multi-link subnet
   issues [RFC4903].

4.2.  VET Border Router (VBR) Autoconfiguration

   VBRs are ERs that configure and use one or more VET interfaces.  In
   addition to the ER autoconfiguration procedures specified in
   Section 4.1, VBRs perform the following autoconfiguration operations.

4.2.1.  VET Interface Initialization

   VBRs configure a separate VET interface for each VET link, where each
   VET link spans a distinct sets of underlying links belonging to the
   same enterprise network.  All nodes on the VET link appear as single-
   hop neighbors from the standpoint of the inner network layer protocol
   through the use of encapsulation.

   The VBR binds each VET interface to one or more underlying
   interfaces, and uses the underlying interface addresses as RLOCs to
   serve as the outer source addresses for encapsulated packets.  The
   VBR then assigns a link-local address to each VET interface if
   necessary.  When IPv6 and IPv4 are used as the inner/outer protocols
   (respectively), the VBR can autoconfigure an IPv6 link-local address
   on the VET interface using a modified EUI-64 interface identifier
   based on an IPv4 RLOC address (see Section 2.2.1 of [RFC5342]).
   Link-local address configuration for other inner/outer protocol
   combinations is through administrative configuration, random self-
   generation (e.g., [RFC4941], etc.) or through an unspecified
   alternate method.

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


4.2.2.  Potential Router List (PRL) Discovery

   After initializing the VET interface, the VBR next discovers a
   Potential Router List (PRL) for the VET link that includes the RLOC
   addresses of VBGs.  The PRL can be discovered through administrative
   configuration, information conveyed in the enterprise-interior
   routing protocol, an anycast VBG discovery message exchange, a DHCP
   option, etc.  In multicast-capable enterprise networks, VBRs can also
   listen for advertisements on the 'rasadv' [RASADV] multicast group
   address.

   When no other information is available, the VBR can resolve an
   identifying name for the PRL ('PRLNAME') formed as
   'hostname.domainname', where 'hostname' is an enterprise-specific
   name string and 'domainname' is an enterprise-specific Domain Name
   System (DNS) suffix [RFC1035].  The VBR discovers 'PRLNAME' through
   administrative configuration, the DHCP Domain Name option [RFC2132],
   'rasadv' protocol advertisements, link-layer information (e.g., an
   IEEE 802.11 Service Set Identifier (SSID)), or through some other
   means specific to the enterprise network.  The VBR can also obtain
   'PRLNAME' as part of an arrangement with a private-sector Virtual
   Service Provider (VSP) (see: Section 4.2.4).

   In the absence of other information, the VBR sets the 'hostname'
   component of 'PRLNAME' to "isatapv2" and sets the 'domainname'
   component to an enterprise-specific DNS suffix (e.g., "example.com").
   Isolated enterprise networks that do not connect to the outside world
   may have no enterprise-specific DNS suffix, in which case the
   'PRLNAME' consists only of the 'hostname' component.  (Note that the
   default hostname "isatapv2" is intentionally distinct from the
   convention specified in [RFC5214].)

   After discovering 'PRLNAME', the VBR resolves the name into a list of
   RLOC addresses through a name service lookup.  For centrally managed
   enterprise networks, the VBR resolves 'PRLNAME' using an enterprise-
   local name service (e.g., the DNS).  For enterprises with no
   centralized management structure, the VBR resolves 'PRLNAME' using a
   distributed name service query such as Link-Local Multicast Name
   Resolution (LLMNR) [RFC4795] over the VET interface.  In that case,
   all VBGs in the PRL respond to the query, and the VBR accepts the
   union of all responses.

4.2.3.  Provider-Aggregated (PA) EID Prefix Autoconfiguration

   VBRs that connect their enterprise networks to a provider network can
   obtain Provider-Aggregated (PA) EID prefixes through stateful and/or
   stateless autoconfiguration mechanisms.  The stateful and stateless
   approaches are discussed in the following subsections.

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


4.2.3.1.  Stateful Prefix Delegation

   For IPv4, VBRs acquire IPv4 PA EID prefixes through administrative
   configuration, an automated IPv4 prefix delegation exchange, etc.

   For IPv6, VBRs acquire IPv6 PA EID prefixes through administrative
   configuration or through DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation exchanges with a
   VBG acting as a DHCP relay/server.  In particular, the VBR (acting as
   a requesting router) can use DHCPv6 prefix delegation [RFC3633] over
   the VET interface to obtain prefixes from the VBG (acting as a
   delegating router).  The VBR obtains prefixes using either a
   2-message or 4-message DHCPv6 exchange [RFC3315].  When the VBR acts
   as a DHCPv6 client, it maps the IPv6
   "All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers" link- scoped multicast address to
   the VBG's outer RLOC address.

   To perform the 2-message exchange, the VBR's DHCPv6 client function
   can send a Solicit message with an IA_PD option either directly or
   via the VBR's own DHCPv6 relay function (see Section 4.1).  The VBR's
   VET interface then forwards the message using VET encapsulation (see:
   Section 5.4) to a VBG which either services the request or relays it
   further.  The forwarded Solicit message will elicit a Reply message
   from the server containing prefix delegations.  The VBR can also
   propose a specific prefix to the DHCPv6 server per Section 7 of
   [RFC3633].  The server will check the proposed prefix for consistency
   and uniqueness, then return it in the Reply message if it was able to
   perform the delegation.

   After the VBR receives IPv4 and/or IPv6 prefix delegations, it can
   provision the prefixes on enterprise-edge interfaces as well as on
   other VET interfaces configured over child enterprise networks for
   which it acts as a VBG.  The VBR can also provision the prefixes on
   enterprise-interior interfaces to service directly-attached hosts on
   the enterprise-interior link.

   The prefix delegations remain active as long as the VBR continues to
   renew them via the delegating VBG before lease lifetimes expire.  The
   lease lifetime also keeps the delegation state active even if
   communications between the VBR and delegating VBG are disrupted for a
   period of time (e.g., due to an enterprise network partition, power
   failure, etc.).  Note however that if the VBR abandons or otherwise
   loses continuity with the prefixes, it may be obliged to perform
   network-wide renumbering if it subsequently receives a new and
   different set of prefixes.

   Stateful prefix delegation for non-IP protocols is out of scope.

4.2.3.2.  Stateless Prefix Delegation

   When IPv6 and IPv4 are used as the inner and outer protocols,
   respectively, a stateless IPv6 PA prefix delegation capability is
   available using the mechanisms specified in [RFC5569][RFC5969].  VBRs
   can use these mechanisms to statelessly configure IPv6 PA prefixes
   that embed one of the VBR's IPv4 RLOCs.

   Using this stateless prefix delegation, if the IPv4 RLOC changes the
   IPv6 prefix also changes and the VBR is obliged to renumber any
   interfaces on which sub-prefixes from the delegated prefix are
   assigned.  This method may therefore be most suitable for enterprise
   networks in which IPv4 RLOC assignments rarely change, or in
   enterprise networks in which only services that do not depend on a
   long-term stable IPv6 prefix (e.g., client-side web browsing) are
   used.

   Stateless prefix delegation for other protocol combinations is out of
   scope.

4.2.4.  ISP-Independent EID Prefix Autoconfiguration

   VBRs can acquire ISP-independent prefixes to facilitate multihoming,
   mobility and traffic engineering without requiring site-wide
   renumbering events due to a change in ISP connections.

   VBRs that connect major enterprise networks (e.g., large
   corporations, academic campuses, ISP networks, etc.) to the global
   Internet can acquire short Provider-Independent (PI) prefixes (e.g.,
   an IPv6 ::/32, an IPv4 /16, etc.) through a registration authority
   such as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) or a major
   regional Internet registry.  The VBR then advertises the PI prefixes
   into the global Internet on the behalf of its enterprise network
   without the assistance of an ISP.

   VBRs that connect small enterprise networks (e.g., SOHO networks,
   MANETs, etc.) to a provider network can acquire longer Virtually
   Aggregated (VA) prefixes (e.g., an IPv6 ::/56, an IPv4 /24, etc.)
   through arrangements with a Virtual Service Provider (VSP) that may
   or may not be associated with a specific ISP.  The VBR then
   coordinates its VA prefixes with a VSP independently of any of its
   directly attached ISPs.  (In many cases, the "VSP" may in fact be a
   major enterprise network that delegates VAs from its PI prefixes.)

   After a VBR receives PI/VA prefixes, it can sub-delegate portions of
   the prefixes on enterprise-edge interfaces, on child VET interfaces
   for which it is configured as a VBG and on enterprise-interior
   interfaces to service directly-attached hosts on the enterprise-

   interior link.  The VBR can also sub-delegate portions of its PI/VA
   prefixes to requesting routers connected to child enterprise
   networks.  These requesting routers consider their sub-delegated
   portions of the PI/VA prefix as PA, and consider the delegating
   routers as their points of connection to a provider network.

4.3.  VET Border Gateway (VBG) Autoconfiguration

   VBGs are VBRs that connect VET links configured over child enterprise
   networks to provider networks via provider-edge interfaces and/or via
   VET links configured over parent enterprise networks.  A VBG may also
   act as a "half-gateway", in that it may need to forward the packets
   it receives from neighbors on the VET link via another VBG associated
   with the same VET link.  This arrangement is seen in the IRON
   [I-D.templin-ironbis] Client/Server/Relay architecture, in which a
   Server "half-gateway" is a VBG that forwards packets with enterprise-
   external destinations via a Relay "half-gateway" that connects the
   VET link to the provider network.

   VBGs autoconfigure their provider-edge interfaces in a manner that is
   specific to the provider connections, and they autoconfigure their
   VET interfaces that were configured over parent VET links using the
   VBR autoconfiguration procedures specified in Section 4.2.  For each
   of its VET interfaces connected to child VET links, the VBG
   initializes the interface the same as for an ordinary VBR (see
   Section 4.2.1).  It then arranges to add one or more of its RLOCs
   associated with the child VET link to the PRL.

   VBGs configure a DHCP relay/server on VET interfaces connected to
   child VET links that require DHCP services.  VBGs may also engage in
   an unspecified anycast VBG discovery message exchange if they are
   configured to do so.  Finally, VBGs respond to distributed name
   service queries for 'PRLNAME' on VET interfaces connected to VET
   links that span child enterprise networks with a distributed
   management structure.

4.4.  VET Host Autoconfiguration

   Nodes that cannot be attached via a VBR's enterprise-edge interface
   (e.g., nomadic laptops that connect to a home office via a Virtual
   Private Network (VPN)) can instead be configured for operation as a
   simple host on the VET link.  Each VET host performs the same
   enterprise interior interface RLOC configuration procedures as
   specified for ERs in Section 4.1.  The VET host next performs the
   same VET interface initialization and PRL discovery procedures as
   specified for VBRs in Section 4.2, except that it configures its VET
   interfaces as host interfaces (and not router interfaces).  Note also
   that a node may be configured as a host on some VET interfaces and as

   a VBR/VBG on other VET interfaces.

   A VET host may receive non-link-local addresses and/or prefixes to
   assign to the VET interface via DHCP exchanges and/or through SLAAC
   information conveyed in RAs.  If prefixes are provided, however,
   there must be assurance that either 1) the VET link will not
   partition, or 2) that each VET host interface connected to the VET
   link will configure a unique set of prefixes.  VET hosts therefore
   depend on DHCP and/or RA exchanges to provide only addresses/prefixes
   that are appropriate for assignment to the VET interface according to
   these specific cases, and depend on the VBGs within the enterprise
   keeping track of which addresses/prefixes were assigned to which
   hosts.

   When the VET host solicits a DHCP-assigned EID address/prefix over a
   (non-multicast) VET interface, it maps the DHCP relay/server
   multicast inner destination address to the outer RLOC address of a
   VBG that it has selected as a default router.  The VET host then
   assigns any resulting DHCP-delegated addresses/prefixes to the VET
   interface for use as the source address of inner packets.  The host
   will subsequently send all packets destined to EID correspondents via
   a default router on the VET link, and may discover more-specific
   routes based on any redirect messages it receives.


5.  Internetworking Operation

   Following the autoconfiguration procedures specified in Section 4,
   ERs, VBRs, VBGs, and VET hosts engage in normal internetworking
   operations as discussed in the following sections.

5.1.  Routing Protocol Participation

   ERs engage in any RLOC-based routing protocols over enterprise-
   interior interfaces to exchange routing information for forwarding IP
   packets with RLOC addresses.  VBRs and VBGs can additionally engage
   in any EID-based routing protocols over VET, enterprise-edge and
   provider-edge interfaces to exchange routing information for
   forwarding inner network layer packets with EID addresses.  Note that
   any EID-based routing instances are separate and distinct from any
   RLOC-based routing instances.

   VBR/VBG routing protocol participation on non-multicast VET
   interfaces uses the NBMA interface model, e.g., in the same manner as
   for OSPF over NBMA interfaces [RFC5340].  (VBR/VBG routing protocol
   participation on multicast-capable VET interfaces can alternatively
   use the standard multicast interface model, but this may result in
   excessive multicast control message overhead.)

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


   VBRs can use the list of VBGs in the PRL (see: Section 4.2.1) as an
   initial list of neighbors for EID-based routing protocol
   participation.  VBRs can alternatively use the list of VBGs as
   potential default routers instead of engaging in an EID-based routing
   protocol instance.  In that case, when the VBR forwards a packet via
   a VBG it may receive a redirect message indicating a different VET
   node as a better next hop.

5.1.1.  PI Prefix Routing Considerations

   VBRs that connect large enterprise networks to the global Internet
   advertise their EID PI prefixes directly into the Internet default-
   free RIB via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] on their own
   behalf the same as for a major service provider network.  VBRs that
   connect large enterprise networks to provider networks can instead
   advertise their EID PI prefixes into their providers' routing
   system(s) if the provider networks are configured to accept them.

5.1.2.  VA Prefix Routing Considerations

   VBRs that connect small enterprise networks to provider networks
   obtain one or more VA prefixes and register them with a serving VBG
   in the VSP's network (e.g., through a vendor-specific short TCP
   transaction).  The VSP network then acts as a virtual "home"
   enterprise network that connects its customer small enterprise
   networks to the Internet routing system.  The customer small
   enterprise networks in turn appear as mobile components of the VSP's
   network, while the customer network uses its ISP connections solely
   as transits.  (In many cases, the "VSP" may in fact be a major
   enterprise network that delegates VAs from its PI prefixes to child
   small enterprise networks.)

5.2.  Default Route Configuration and Selection

   Configuration of default routes in the presence of VET interfaces
   must be carefully coordinated according to the inner and outer
   network protocols.  If the inner and outer protocols are different
   (e.g., IPv6 within IPv4) then default routes of the inner protocol
   version can be configured with next-hops corresponding to default
   routers on a VET interface while default routes of the outer protocol
   version can be configured with next-hops corresponding to default
   routers on an underlying interface.

   If the inner and outer protocols are the same (e.g., IPv4 within
   IPv4), care must be taken in setting the default route to avoid
   ambiguity.  For example, if default routes are configured on the VET
   interface then more-specific routes could be configured on underlying
   interfaces to avoid looping.  Alternatively, multiple default routes



Templin                  Expires April 21, 2012                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


   can be configured with some having next-hops corresponding to (EID-
   based) default routers on VET interfaces and others having next-hops
   corresponding to (RLOC-based) default routers on underlying
   interfaces.  In that case, special next-hop determination rules must
   be used (see: Section 5.4).

5.3.  Address Selection

   When permitted by policy and supported by enterprise-interior
   routing, VET nodes can avoid encapsulation through communications
   that directly invoke the outer IP protocol using RLOC addresses
   instead of EID addresses for end-to-end communications.  For example,
   an enterprise network that provides native IPv4 intra-enterprise
   services can provide continued support for native IPv4 communications
   even when encapsulated IPv6 services are available for inter-
   enterprise communications.  In other enterprise network scenarios,
   the use of EID-based communications (i.e., instead of RLOC-based
   communications) may be necessary and/or beneficial to support address
   scaling, transparent Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal,
   security domain separation, site multihoming, traffic engineering,
   etc. .

   VET nodes can use source address selection rules (e.g., based on name
   service information) to determine whether to use EID-based or RLOC-
   based addressing.  The remainder of this section discusses
   internetworking operation for EID-based communications using the VET
   interface abstraction.

5.4.  Next Hop Determination

   VET nodes perform normal next-hop determination via longest prefix
   match, and send packets according to the most-specific matching entry
   in the FIB.  If the FIB entry has multiple next-hop addresses, the
   VBR selects the next-hop with the best metric value.  If multiple
   next hops have the same metric value, the VET node can use Equal Cost
   Multi Path (ECMP) to forward different flows via different next-hop
   addresses, where flows are determined, e.g., by computing a hash of
   the inner packet's source address, destination address and flow label
   fields.

   If the VET node has multiple default routes of the same inner and
   outer protocol versions, with some corresponding to EID-based default
   routers and others corresponding to RLOC-based default routers, it
   must perform source address based selection of a default route.  In
   particular, if the packet's source address is taken from an EID
   prefix the VET node selects a default route configured over the VET
   interface; otherwise, it selects a default route configured over an
   underlying interface.



Templin                  Expires April 21, 2012                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


   As a last resort when there is no matching entry in the FIB (i.e.,
   not even default), VET nodes can discover neighbors within the
   enterprise network through on-demand name service queries for the
   packet's destination address (or, by some other inner address to
   outer address mapping distribution system).  For example, for the
   IPv6 destination address '2001:DB8:1:2::1' and 'PRLNAME'
   "isatapv2.example.com" the VET node can perform a name service lookup
   for the domain name:
   '1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.
   isatapv2.example.com'.

   The name service will use wildcard matching [RFC4592] to determine
   the most-specific matching entry.  For example, if the most-specific
   prefix that covers the IPv6 destination address is '2001:DB8:1::/48'
   the matching entry is:

   '*.1.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.isatapv2.example.com'.

   If the name-service lookup succeeds, it will return RLOC addresses
   (e.g., in DNS A records) that correspond to neighbors to which the
   VET node can forward packets.

   Name-service lookups in enterprise networks with a centralized
   management structure use an infrastructure-based service, e.g., an
   enterprise-local DNS.  Name-service lookups in enterprise networks
   with a distributed management structure and/or that lack an
   infrastructure-based name service instead use a distributed name
   service such as LLMNR over the VET interface.  When a distributed
   name service is used, the VBR that performs the lookup sends a
   multicast query and accepts the union of all replies it receives from
   neighbors on the VET interface.  When a VET node receives the query,
   it responds IFF it aggregates an IP prefix that covers the prefix in
   the query.

5.5.  VET Interface Encapsulation/Decapsulation

   VET interfaces encapsulate inner network layer packets in any
   necessary mid-layer headers and trailers (e.g., IPsec [RFC4301],
   etc.) followed by a SEAL header (if necessary) followed by an outer
   transport-layer header such as UDP (if necessary) followed by an
   outer IP header.  Following all encapsulations, the VET interface
   submits the encapsulated packet to the outer IP forwarding engine for
   transmission on an underlying interface.  The following sections
   provide further details on encapsulation:

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


5.5.1.  Inner Network Layer Protocol

   The inner network layer protocol sees the VET interface as an
   ordinary network interface, and views the outer network layer
   protocol as an ordinary L2 transport.  The inner- and outer network
   layer protocol types are mutually independent and can be used in any
   combination.  Inner network layer protocol types include IPv6
   [RFC2460] and IPv4 [RFC0791], but they may also include non-IP
   protocols such as OSI/CLNP [RFC0994][RFC1070][RFC4548].

5.5.2.  Mid-Layer Encapsulation

   VET interfaces that use mid-layer encapsulations encapsulate each
   inner network layer packet in any mid-layer headers and trailers as
   the first step in a potentially multi-layer encapsulation.

5.5.3.  SEAL Encapsulation

   Following any mid-layer encapsulations, VET interfaces that use SEAL
   add a SEAL header as specified in [I-D.templin-intarea-seal].
   Inclusion of a SEAL header must be applied uniformly between all
   neighbors on the VET link.  Note that when a VET interface sends a
   SEAL-encapsulated packet to a neighbor that does not use SEAL
   encapsulation, it may receive an ICMP "port unreachable" or "protocol
   unreachable" depending on whether/not an outer UDP header is
   included.

   SEAL encapsulation is used on VET links that require path MTU
   mitigations due to encapsulation overhead and/or mechanisms for VET
   interface neighbor coordination and error message handling.  When
   SEAL encapsulation is used, the VET interface sets the 'Next Header'
   value in the SEAL header to the IP protocol number associated with
   either the mid-layer encapsulation or the IP protocol number of the
   inner network layer (if no mid-layer encapsulation is used).  The VET
   interface sets the other fields in the SEAL header as specified in
   [I-D.templin-intarea-seal].

5.5.4.  Outer Transport-Layer Header Encapsulation

   Following any mid-layer and/or SEAL encapsulations, VET interfaces
   that use a transport layer encapsulation such as UDP add an outer
   transport layer header.  Inclusion of an outer UDP header must be
   applied uniformly between all neighbors on the VET link.  Note that
   when a VET interface sends a UDP-encapsulated packet to a neighbor
   that does not recognize the UDP port number, it may receive an ICMP
   "port unreachable" message.

   VET interfaces use UDP encapsulation on VET links that may traverse



Templin                  Expires April 21, 2012                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


   NATs and/or legacy networking gear (e.g., Equal Cost MultiPath (ECMP)
   routers, Link Aggregation Gateways (LAGs), etc.) that only recognize
   well-known network layer protocols.  When UDP encapsulation is used,
   the VET interface encapsulates the mid-layer packet in an outer UDP
   header then sets the UDP port numbers as specified for the outermost
   mid-layer protocol (e.g., IPsec [RFC3947][RFC3948], etc.).

   When SEAL encapsulation [I-D.templin-intarea-seal] is also used, the
   VET interface maintains per-neighbor local and remote UDP port
   numbers.  For bidirectional neighbors, the interface sets the local
   UDP port number to the value reserved for SEAL and sets the remote
   UDP port number to the observed UDP source port number in packets
   that it receives from the neighbor.  In cases in which one of the
   bidirectional neighbors is behind a NAT, this implies that the one
   behind the NAT initiates the neighbor relationship.  If both
   neighbors have a way of knowing that there are no NATs in the path,
   then they may select and set port numbers as for unidirectional
   neighbors.

   For unidirectional neighbors, the VET interface sets both the local
   and remote UDP port numbers to the value reserved for SEAL, and
   additionally selects a small set of dynamic port number values for
   use as additional local UDP port numbers.  The VET interface then
   selects one of this set of local port numbers for the UDP source port
   for each inner packet it sends, where the port number is determined
   e.g., by a hash calculated over the inner network layer addresses and
   inner transport layer port numbers.  The VET interface uses a hash
   function of its own choosing when selecting a dynamic port number
   value, but it should choose a function that provides uniform
   distribution between the set of values, and it should be consistent
   in the manner in which the hash is applied.

   Finally, for VET links configured over IPv4 enterprise networks, the
   VET interface sets the UDP checksum field to zero.  For VET links
   configured over IPv6 enterprise networks, considerations for setting
   the UDP checksum are discussed in [I-D.ietf-6man-udpzero].

5.5.5.  Outer IP Header Encapsulation

   Following any mid-layer, SEAL and/or UDP encapsulations, the VET
   interface adds an outer IP header.  Outer IP header construction is
   the same as specified for ordinary IP encapsulation (e.g., [RFC2003],
   [RFC2473], [RFC4213], etc.) except that the "TTL/Hop Limit", "Type of
   Service/Traffic Class" and "Congestion Experienced" values in the
   inner network layer header are copied into the corresponding fields
   in the outer IP header.  The VET interface also sets the IP protocol
   number to the appropriate value for the first protocol layer within
   the encapsulation (e.g., UDP, SEAL, IPsec, etc.).  When IPv6 is used



Templin                  Expires April 21, 2012                [Page 25]

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


   as the outer IP protocol, the VET interface sets the flow label value
   in the outer IPv6 header the same as described in
   [I-D.carpenter-flow-ecmp].

5.5.6.  Decapsulation

   When a VET interface receives an encapsulated packet, it retains the
   outer headers and processes the SEAL header as specified in
   [I-D.templin-intarea-seal].

   Next, if the packet will be forwarded from the receiving VET
   interface into a forwarding VET interface, the VET node copies the
   "TTL/Hop Limit", "Type of Service/Traffic Class" and "Congestion
   Experienced" values in the outer IP header received on the receiving
   VET interface into the corresponding fields in the outer IP header to
   be sent over the forwarding VET interface (i.e., the values are
   transferred between outer headers and *not* copied from the inner
   network layer header).  This is true even if the packet is forwarded
   out the same VET interface that it arrived on, and necessary to
   support diagnostic functions (e.g., traceroute) and avoid looping.

   During decapsulation, when the next-hop is via a non-VET interface,
   the "Congestion Experienced" value in the outer IP header is copied
   into the corresponding field in the inner network layer header.

5.6.  Neighbor Coordination on VET Interfaces that use SEAL

   VET interfaces that use SEAL use the SEAL Control Message Protocol
   (SCMP) as specified in Section 4.5 of [I-D.templin-intarea-seal] to
   coordinate reachability, routing information, and mappings between
   the inner and outer network layer protocols.  SCMP directly parallels
   the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) [RFC4191][RFC4861] and ICMPv6
   [RFC4443] protocols, but operates from within the tunnel and supports
   operation for any combinations of inner and outer network layer
   protocols.

   When a VET interface that uses SEAL prepares a neighbor coordination
   SCMP message, the message is formatted the same as described for the
   corresponding IPv6 ND message, except that the message body is
   preceded by a SEAL header the same as for SCMP error messages.  The
   interface sets the SEAL header flags to (C=1, A=0, R=0, F=1, M=0),
   and sets the NEXTHDR/SEG field to 0.  It further sets the SEAL Link
   ID (LINK_ID) and Neighbor ID (NBR_ID) values according to the values
   that are cached for the target tunnel neighbor.  The VET interface
   MAY additionally include a Packet ID (PKT_ID) field, in which case it
   would also set the flag I=1.

   VET and SEAL are specifically designed for encapsulation of inner

   network layer payloads over outer IPv4 and IPv6 networks as a link
   layer.  VET interfaces that use SCMP therefore require a new Source/
   Target Link-Layer Address Option (S/TLLAO) format that encapsulates
   IPv4 addresses as shown in Figure 2 and IPv6 addresses as shown in
   Figure 3:

   In this modified format, the VET interface sets the Route Lifetime
   and Prefix fields in the RIO option the same as specified in
   [RFC4191].  It then sets the fields in the header as follows:

   o  the 'Type', 'Prf', and 'Resvd' fields are set the same as
      specified in [RFC4191].

   o  the 'Length' field is set to 1, 2, or 3 as specified in [RFC4191].
      It is instead set to 4 if the 'Prefix Length' is greater than 128
      and set to 5 if the 'Prefix Length' is greater than 192 (e.g., in
      order to accommodate longer prefixes of non-IP protocols).

   o  the 'Prefix Length' field ranges from 0 to 255.  The 'Prefix'
      field is 0, 8, 16, 24 or 32 octets depending on the Length, and
      the embedded prefix MAY be up to 255 bits in length.

   o  bits 24 - 26 are used to contain an 'Address Family (AF)' value
      that indicates the embedded prefix protocol type.  This document
      defines the following values for AF:

      *  000 - IPv4

      *  001 - IPv6

      *  010 - OSI/CLNP NSAP

   When a VBG receives an SRS message on a VET interface, it prepares a
   solicited SRA message.  The SRA includes Router Lifetimes, Default
   Router Preferences, PIOs and any other options/parameters that the
   VBG is configured to include.  If necessary, the VBG also includes
   Route Information Options (RIOs) formatted as specified above.

   The VBG finally includes one or more SLLAOs formatted as specified
   above that encode the IPv6 and/or IPv4 RLOC unicast addresses of its
   own enterprise-interior interfaces or the enterprise-interior
   interfaces of other nearby VBGs.

5.6.2.  Neighbor Unreachability Detection

   VET nodes perform Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) on VET
   interface neighbors by monitoring hints of forward progress enabled
   by SEAL mechanisms as evidence that a neighbor is reachable.  First,
   when data packets are flowing, the VET node can periodically set the
   'A' bit in the SEAL header of data packets to elicit SCMP responses
   from the neighbor.  Secondly, when no data packets are flowing, the
   VET node can send periodic probes such as SCMP Neighbor Solicitation
   (SNS) messages for the same purpose.

   Responsiveness to routing changes is directly related to the delay in
   detecting that a neighbor has gone unreachable.  In order to provide
   responsiveness comparable to dynamic routing protocols, a reasonably
   short neighbor reachable time (e.g., 5sec) SHOULD be used.

   Additionally, a VET node may receive outer IP ICMP "Destination
   Unreachable; net / host unreachable" messages from an ER on the path
   indicating that the path to a neighbor may be failing.  The node
   SHOULD first check the packet-in-error to obtain reasonable assurance
   that the ICMP message is authentic.  If the node receives excessive
   ICMP unreachable errors through multiple RLOCs associated with the
   same FIB entry, it SHOULD delete the FIB entry and allow subsequent
   packets to flow through a different route (e.g., a default route with
   a VBG as the next hop).

5.6.3.  Unidirectional Tunnel Neighbor Discovery

   Source VET nodes can set the 'R' bit in the SEAL header of a data
   packet to be forwarded to R=1 as a "predirect" indication that
   Redirect messages wil be accepted from the target VET node.  Each VBG
   on the chain to the target preserves the state of the 'R' bit when it
   re-encapsulates a SEAL-encapsulated packet.  When the target receives
   the "predirect" indication, it returns a Redirect message similar to
   the manner described in AERO [I-D.templin-aero].

   The target includes Target Link Layer Address Option (TLLAO) in the



Templin                  Expires April 21, 2012                [Page 29]

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


   Redirect message as specified in Section 5.6 above.  It also includes
   a "Redirected Header Option" formatted the same as for ICMPv6
   Redirect messages, except that the option includes the leading
   portion of the SEAL data packet that triggered the redirection event
   beginning with the midlayer headers following the SEAL header.  The
   target finally includes a 128 bit "password" in the "Target" field of
   the Redirect message, i.e., instead of including an IPv6 address.

   When the target returns the Redirect message, each VBG on the chain
   toward the source proxies the message by examining the source address
   in the packet encapsulated in the Redirected Header Option to
   determine the previous hop.  When the source VET node receives the
   Redirect message, it caches the password, and uses it to sign
   subsequent packets it sends to this new (unidirectional) target
   neighbor.  The target neighbor can then use the signature to
   authenticate the source of the packets.  Note that the target
   neighbor need not check the outer source addresses/port numbers of
   the packets, since it is the signature as well as the inner source
   and destination addresses that identify the source.

5.6.4.  Bidirectional Tunnel Neighbor Synchronization

   The tunnel neighbor relationship between a pair of VET interface
   tunnel neighbors can be either unidirectional or bidirectional.  A
   unidirectional relationship (see: Section 5.6.3) can be established
   when Tunnel Endpoint (TE) 'A' will tunnel data packets directly to TE
   'B', but 'B' will not tunnel data packets directly to 'A'.  A
   bidirectional relationship is necessary when both TEs will tunnel
   data packets directly to one another.

   In order to establish a bidirectional tunnel neighbor relationship,
   the initiating TE (call it "A") performs a reliable exchange (e.g., a
   short TCP transaction, a DHCP client/server exchange, etc.) with the
   responding TE (call it "B").  The application layer details of the
   transaction are out of scope for this document, and indeed need not
   be standardized as long as both TEs observe the same specifications.
   Note that a short transaction instead of a persistent connection is
   advised if the outer network layer protocol addresses may change,
   e.g., due to a mobility event, due to loss of state in network
   middleboxes, etc.  If there is assurance that the outer network layer
   protocol addresses will not change, then a persistent connection may
   be used.

   During the transaction, "A" and "B" first authenticate themselves to
   each other, then exchange information regarding the inner network
   layer prefixes that will be used for conveying inner packets that
   will be forwarded over the tunnel.  Both TEs then select a randomly-
   generated NBR_ID and one or more randomly-generated LINK_IDs, where



Templin                  Expires April 21, 2012                [Page 30]

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


   each LINK_ID represents a different underlying link over which the
   tunnel interface is configured.  Both TEs then register their
   (NBR_ID, LINK_ID)-tuples with each other to establish the appropriate
   bidirectional tunnel neighbor soft state (see Sections 4.4.2 and
   4.5.2).

   Following this bidirectional tunnel neighbor establishment, the TEs
   monitor the soft state for liveness, e.g., using Neighbor
   Unreachability Detection hints of forward progress.  When one of the
   TEs wishes to terminate the relationship, it performs another short
   transaction to request the termination, then both TEs delete their
   respective tunnel soft state.

   This bidirectional tunnel neighbor establishment is most commonly
   initiated by a client TE in establishing a connection with a serving
   TE, e.g., when a customer router within a home network establishes a
   connection with a serving router in a provider network, when a mobile
   handset connects with a serving router in a cellular operator
   network, etc.

5.7.  Neighbor Coordination on VET Interfaces using IPsec

   VET interfaces that use IPsec encapsulation use the Internet Key
   Exchange protocol, version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC4306] to manage security
   association setup and maintenance.  IKEv2 provides a logical
   equivalent of the SCMP in terms of VET interface neighbor
   coordinations; for example, IKEv2 also provides mechanisms for
   redirection [RFC5685] and mobility [RFC4555].

   IPsec additionally provides an extended Identification field and
   integrity check vector; these features allow IPsec to utilize outer
   IP fragmentation and reassembly with less risk of exposure to data
   corruption due to reassembly misassociations.  On the other hand,
   IPsec entails the use of symmetric security associations and hence
   may not be appropriate to all enterprise network use cases.

5.8.  Mobility and Multihoming Considerations

   VBRs that travel between distinct enterprise networks must either
   abandon their PA prefixes that are relative to the "old" network and
   obtain PA prefixes relative to the "new" network, or somehow
   coordinate with a "home" network to retain ownership of the prefixes.
   In the first instance, the VBR would be required to coordinate a
   network renumbering event on its attached networks using the new PA
   prefixes [RFC4192][RFC5887].  In the second instance, an adjunct
   mobility management mechanism is required.

   VBRs can retain their VA prefixes as they travel between distinct



Templin                  Expires April 21, 2012                [Page 31]

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


   network points of attachment as long as they continue to refresh
   their VA prefix to RLOC address mappings with their serving VBG as
   described in [I-D.templin-ironbis].  (When the VBR moves far from its
   serving VBG, it can also select a new VBG in order to maintain
   optimal routing.)  In this way, VBRs can update their VA prefix to
   RLOC mappings in real time and without requiring an adjunct mobility
   management mechanism.

   VBRs that have true PI prefixes can withdraw the prefixes from former
   Internet points of attachment and re-advertise them at new points of
   attachment as they move.  However, this method has been shown to
   produce excessive routing churn in the global internet BGP tables,
   and should be avoided for any mobility scenarios that may occur along
   short timescales.  The alternative is to employ a system in which the
   true PI prefixes are not injected into the Internet routing system,
   but rather managed through some separate global mapping database.
   This latter method is employed by the LISP proposal [I-D.ietf-lisp].

   The VBGs of a multihomed enterprise network participate in a private
   inner network layer routing protocol instance (e.g., via an interior
   BGP instance) to accommodate network partitions/merges as well as
   intra-enterprise mobility events.

5.9.  Multicast

5.9.1.  Multicast over (Non)Multicast Enterprise Networks

   Whether or not the underlying enterprise network supports a native
   multicasting service, the VET node can act as an inner network layer
   IGMP/MLD proxy [RFC4605] on behalf of its attached EUNs and convey
   its multicast group memberships over the VET interface to a VBG
   acting as a multicast router.  Its inner network layer multicast
   transmissions will therefore be encapsulated in outer headers with
   the unicast address of the VBG as the destination.

5.9.2.  Multicast Over Multicast-Capable Enterprise Networks

   In multicast-capable enterprise networks, ERs provide an enterprise-
   wide multicasting service (e.g., Simplified Multicast Forwarding
   (SMF) [I-D.ietf-manet-smf], Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
   routing, Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) routing,
   etc.) over their enterprise-interior interfaces such that outer IP
   multicast messages of site-scope or greater scope will be propagated
   across the enterprise network.  For such deployments, VET nodes can
   optionally provide a native inner multicast/broadcast capability over
   their VET interfaces through mapping of the inner multicast address
   space to the outer multicast address space.  In that case, operation
   of link-or greater-scoped inner multicasting services (e.g., a link-



Templin                  Expires April 21, 2012                [Page 32]

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


   scoped neighbor discovery protocol) over the VET interface is
   available, but SHOULD be used sparingly to minimize enterprise-wide
   flooding.

   VET nodes encapsulate inner multicast messages sent over the VET
   interface in any mid-layer headers (e.g., UDP, SEAL, IPsec, etc.)
   followed by an outer IP header with a site-scoped outer IP multicast
   address as the destination.  For the case of IPv6 and IPv4 as the
   inner/outer protocols (respectively), [RFC2529] provides mappings
   from the IPv6 multicast address space to a site-scoped IPv4 multicast
   address space (for other encapsulations, mappings are established
   through administrative configuration or through an unspecified
   alternate static mapping).

   Multicast mapping for inner multicast groups over outer IP multicast
   groups can be accommodated, e.g., through VET interface snooping of
   inner multicast group membership and routing protocol control
   messages.  To support inner-to-outer multicast address mapping, the
   VET interface acts as a virtual outer IP multicast host connected to
   its underlying interfaces.  When the VET interface detects that an
   inner multicast group joins or leaves, it forwards corresponding
   outer IP multicast group membership reports on an underlying
   interface over which the VET interface is configured.  If the VET
   node is configured as an outer IP multicast router on the underlying
   interfaces, the VET interface forwards locally looped-back group
   membership reports to the outer IP multicast routing process.  If the
   VET node is configured as a simple outer IP multicast host, the VET
   interface instead forwards actual group membership reports (e.g.,
   IGMP messages) directly over an underlying interface.

   Since inner multicast groups are mapped to site-scoped outer IP
   multicast groups, the VET node MUST ensure that the site-scoped outer
   IP multicast messages received on the underlying interfaces for one
   VET interface do not "leak out" to the underlying interfaces of
   another VET interface.  This is accommodated through normal site-
   scoped outer IP multicast group filtering at enterprise network
   boundaries.

5.10.  Service Discovery

   VET nodes can perform enterprise-wide service discovery using a
   suitable name-to-address resolution service.  Examples of flooding-
   based services include the use of LLMNR [RFC4795] over the VET
   interface or multicast DNS (mDNS) [I-D.cheshire-dnsext-multicastdns]
   over an underlying interface.  More scalable and efficient service
   discovery mechanisms (e.g., anycast) are for further study.

5.11.  VET Link Partitioning

   A VET link can be partitioned into multiple distinct logical
   groupings.  In that case, each partition configures its own distinct
   'PRLNAME' (e.g., 'isatapv2.zone1.example.com',
   'isatapv2.zone2.example.com', etc.).

   VBGs can further create multiple IP subnets within a partition, e.g.,
   by sending SRAs with PIOs containing different IP prefixes to
   different groups of VET hosts.  VBGs can identify subnets, e.g., by
   examining RLOC prefixes, observing the enterprise-interior interfaces
   over which SRSs are received, etc.

   In the limiting case, VBGs can advertise a unique set of IP prefixes
   to each VET host such that each host belongs to a different subnet
   (or set of subnets) on the VET interface.

5.12.  VBG Prefix State Recovery

   VBGs retain explicit state that tracks the inner network layer
   prefixes delegated to VBRs connected to the VET link, e.g., so that
   packets are delivered to the correct VBRs.  When a VBG loses some or
   all of its state (e.g., due to a power failure), client VBRs must
   refresh the VBG's state so that packets can be forwarded over correct
   routes.

5.13.  Legacy ISATAP Services

   VBGs can support legacy ISATAP services according to the
   specifications in [RFC5214].  In particular, VBGs can configure
   legacy ISATAP interfaces and VET interfaces over the same sets of
   underlying interfaces as long as the PRLs and IPv6 prefixes
   associated with the ISATAP/VET interfaces are distinct.

   Legacy ISATAP hosts acquire addresses and/or prefixes in the same
   manner and using the same mechanisms as described for VET hosts in
   Section 4.4 above.


6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations for this document.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for MANETs are found in [RFC2501].

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


   The security considerations found in [RFC2529][RFC5214][RFC6324] also
   apply to VET.

   SEND [RFC3971] and/or IPsec [RFC4301] can be used in environments
   where attacks on the neighbor coordination protocol are possible.
   SEAL [I-D.templin-intarea-seal] provides per-packet identification
   values that can be used to detect source address spoofing.

   Rogue neighbor coordination messages with spoofed RLOC source
   addresses can consume network resources and cause VET nodes to
   perform extra work.  Nonetheless, VET nodes SHOULD NOT "blacklist"
   such RLOCs, as that may result in a denial of service to the RLOCs'
   legitimate owners.

   VBRs and VBGs observe the recommendations for network ingress
   filtering [RFC2827].

Appendix A.  Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) Considerations

   A priori uniqueness determination (also known as "pre-service DAD")
   for an RLOC assigned on an enterprise-interior interface would
   require either flooding the entire enterprise network or somehow
   discovering a link in the network on which a node that configures a
   duplicate address is attached and performing a localized DAD exchange
   on that link.  But, the control message overhead for such an
   enterprise-wide DAD would be substantial and prone to false-negatives
   due to packet loss and intermittent connectivity.  An alternative to
   pre-service DAD is to autoconfigure pseudo-random RLOCs on
   enterprise-interior interfaces and employ a passive in-service DAD
   (e.g., one that monitors routing protocol messages for duplicate
   assignments).

   Pseudo-random IPv6 RLOCs can be generated with mechanisms such as
   CGAs, IPv6 privacy addresses, etc. with very small probability of
   collision.  Pseudo-random IPv4 RLOCs can be generated through random
   assignment from a suitably large IPv4 prefix space.

   Consistent operational practices can assure uniqueness for VBG-
   aggregated addresses/prefixes, while statistical properties for
   pseudo-random address self-generation can assure uniqueness for the
   RLOCs assigned on an ER's enterprise-interior interfaces.  Still, an
   RLOC delegation authority should be used when available, while a
   passive in-service DAD mechanism should be used to detect RLOC
   duplications when there is no RLOC delegation authority.


Appendix B.  Anycast Services

   Some of the IPv4 addresses that appear in the Potential Router List
   may be anycast addresses, i.e., they may be configured on the VET
   interfaces of multiple VBRs/VBGs.  In that case, each VET router
   interface that configures the same anycast address must exhibit
   equivalent outward behavior.

   Use of an anycast address as the IP destination address of tunneled
   packets can have subtle interactions with tunnel path MTU and
   neighbor discovery.  For example, if the initial fragments of a
   fragmented tunneled packet with an anycast IP destination address are
   routed to different egress tunnel endpoints than the remaining
   fragments, the multiple endpoints will be left with incomplete

Internet-Draft                     VET                      October 2011


   reassembly buffers.  This issue can be mitigated by ensuring that
   each egress tunnel endpoint implements a proactive reassembly buffer
   garbage collection strategy.  Additionally, ingress tunnel endpoints
   that send packets with an anycast IP destination address must use the
   minimum path MTU for all egress tunnel endpoints that configure the
   same anycast address as the tunnel MTU.  Finally, ingress tunnel
   endpoints should treat ICMP unreachable messages from a router within
   the tunnel as at most a weak indication of neighbor unreachability,
   since the failures may only be transient and a different path to an
   alternate anycast router quickly selected through reconvergence of
   the underlying routing protocol.

   Use of an anycast address as the IP source address of tunneled
   packets can lead to more serious issues.  For example, when the IP
   source address of a tunneled packet is anycast, ICMP messages
   produced by routers within the tunnel might be delivered to different
   ingress tunnel endpoints than the ones that produced the packets.  In
   that case, functions such as path MTU discovery and neighbor
   unreachability detection may experience non-deterministic behavior
   that can lead to communications failures.  Additionally, the
   fragments of multiple tunneled packets produced by multiple ingress
   tunnel endpoints may be delivered to the same reassembly buffer at a
   single egress tunnel endpoint.  In that case, data corruption may
   result due to fragment misassociation during reassembly.

   In view of these considerations, VBGs that configure an anycast
   address should also configure one or more unicast addresses from the
   Potential Router List; they should further accept tunneled packets
   destined to any of their anycast or unicast addresses, but should
   send tunneled packets using a unicast address as the source address.
