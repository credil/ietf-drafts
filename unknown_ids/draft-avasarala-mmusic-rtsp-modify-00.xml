  <t> This specification defines the new MODIFY method for the Real Time Streaming 
      Protocol (RTSP). MODIFY method allows a RTSP client to indicate to the RTSP server
      to modify a particular session. Using MODIFY method, a client can indicate to
      either transfer or share a particular streaming session with other RTSP device.

<section title="Introduction" toc="default">
<t> The RTSP <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis"></xref> defines the SETUP method for the RTSP clients to
    establish streaming sessions with RTSP servers. The SETUP method could also be used for
    session modification when sent in the middle of a streaming session. However this SETUP
    can only be used for changing transport parameters as mentioned in Section 13.3.1 of 
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis"></xref> and not for changing the target device. 
    Now a days with users having multiple devices like mobiles, TV, etc it would become 
    necessary to facilitate sharing or transfer of content streaming sessions across devices. 
    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
    As a result in order to facilitate the sharing or transfer of content streaming sessions
    among RTSP based devices, there is a need for a mechanism within the RTSP protocol to 
    facilitate this procedure. The MODIFY method defined in this document fulfills the need and
    provides a mechanism for the primary RTSP client to initiate a streaming session sharing or
    transfer with another device.

<section title="The MODIFY Method" anchor="modify">
<t>MODIFY is a RTSP method as defined by <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis"></xref>. The
   MODIFY method indicates that the RTSP Client intends to modify certain parameters of 
   the current streaming session (identified by the RTSP URL).The modifications could be a request
   to the RTSP Server to redirect or the share the content streaming session with another RTSP Client.

  <section title="Overview of Operation" anchor="over">
  <t>Operation of this extension is straightforward. The RTSP client begins with a 
  SETUP request which proceeds normally. Once the content streaming session is in
  progress, then the RTSP client can generate a RTSP MODIFY method that contains the
  required operation to be performed and the target device for the purposes of modifying
  the session target i.e. either adding a new target by sharing the session with that
  device or by changing the target by transferring the session to that target. 
  <vspace blankLines="1"/>
  The response to a MODIFY request would be a final response indicating that the operation
  is successful or a suitable error response indicating failure. The Allow header could
  be used to indicate support for the MODIFY method. The usage of MODIFY method SHALL 
  be restricted to only changing the target of content streaming session and not for any
  other modifications. 
  </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Determining support for session target modification" anchor="supp">
  <t> The content streaming session origination happens as per procedures defined in 
  <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis"></xref>. However a RTSP server compliant to 
  this specification SHOULD list the method MODIFY in the Public header field in the 200
  final response sent to the OPTIONS request.
  <vspace blankLines="1"/>
  If the Public header in the 2xx response from RTSP server contains MODIFY method, it 
  indicates that the RTSP server supports session modification procedures for changing
  the target and the RTSP client can follow the procedures of <xref target="sessmod"></xref>. </t>
  </section>
  <section title="MODIFY method handling" anchor="modhand">
    <section title="Sending a session modification request" anchor="sessmod">
    <t> The MODIFY request would be constructed as would any other request within a particular
    streaming session on a particular URI and only when a particular streaming session is active.
    The RTSP client initiates the MODIFY method request when it wants to either transfer or share
    the ongoing streaming session to or with another RTSP client device. 
    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
    The RTSP device initiating the MODIFY request SHALL add the Require header defined in 
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis"></xref> with the proposed option-tag values "Transfer"
    or "Share" to indicate the action to be taken.
    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
    The RTSP device SHALL also add the proposed Target header as described in <xref target="Target"></xref>, 
    containing the target device address to or with whom the session is being transferred to or shared with. </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Processing a session modification request" anchor="recvmod">
    <t> The MODIFY request is processed as a mid session request. The streaming server looks at the 
        RTSP Require header present in the MODIFY request and determines the corresponding action that needs
        to be taken. Then the server looks for the Target header and determines the new target device. 
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        If the MODIFY is received without the mandatory headers: "Require" and "Target", then the server
        SHALL reject the MODIFY with a 400 Bad Request and a Reason-Phrase as "Missing Require header field".
        In addition if the Require header field has values other than "Transfer" or "Share", then the
        server SHALL reject the MODIFY with a 456 or a 400 Bad Request response.
