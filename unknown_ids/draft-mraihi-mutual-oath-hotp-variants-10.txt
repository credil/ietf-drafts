1.  Introduction

   OATH has identified several use cases and scenarios that require an
   asynchronous variant to accommodate users who do not want to maintain
   a synchronized authentication system.  A commonly accepted method for
   this is to use a challenge-response scheme.

   Such challenge response mode of authentication is widely adopted in
   the industry.  Several vendors already offer software applications
   and hardware devices implementing challenge-response - but each of
   those uses vendor-specific proprietary algorithms.  For the benefits
   of users there is a need for a standardized challenge-response
   algorithm which allows multi-sourcing of token purchases and
   validation systems to facilitate the democratization of strong
   authentication.  Additionally, this specification describes the means
   to create symmetric key based digital signatures.  Such signatures
   are variants of challenge-response mode where the data to be signed
   becomes the challenge.


2.  Notation and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Algorithm Requirements

   This section presents the main requirements that drove this algorithm
   design.  A lot of emphasis was placed on flexibility and usability,
   under the constraints and specificity of the HOTP algorithm and
   hardware token capabilities.

   R1 - The algorithm MUST support asynchronous challenge-response based
   authentication.

   R2 - The algorithm MUST be capable of supporting symmetric key based
   digital signatures.  Essentially this is a variation of challenge-
   response where the challenge is derived from the data that need to be
   signed.

   R3 - The algorithm MUST be capable of supporting server-
   authentication, whereby the user can verify that he/she is talking to
   a trusted server.

   R4 - The algorithm SHOULD use HOTP [RFC4226] as a key building block.

Internet-Draft                    OCRA                        March 2010


   R5 - The length and format of the input challenge SHOULD be
   configurable.

   R6 - The output length and format of the generated response SHOULD be
   configurable.

   R7 - The challenge MAY be generated with integrity checking (e.g.,
   parity bits).  This will allow tokens with pin pads to perform simple
   error checking when the user enters the challenge value into a token.

   R8 - There MUST be a unique secret (key) for each token/soft token
   that is shared between the token and the authentication server.  The
   keys MUST be randomly generated or derived using a key derivation
   algorithm.

   R9 - The algorithm MAY enable additional data attributes such as a
   timestamp or session information to be included in the computation.
   These data inputs MAY be used individually or all together.


4.  OCRA Background

   OATH introduced the HOTP algorithm as a first open, freely available
   building block towards strengthening authentication for end-users in
   a variety of applications.  One-time passwords are very efficient at
   solving specific security issues thanks to the dynamic nature of OTP
   computations.

   After carefully analyzing different use cases, OATH came to the
   conclusion that providing for extensions to the HOTP algorithms was
   important.  A very natural extension is to introduce a challenge mode
   for computing HOTP values based on random questions.  Equally
   beneficial is being able to perform mutual authentication between two
   parties, or short-signature computation for authenticating
   transaction to improve the security of e-commerce applications.

4.1.  HOTP Algorithm

   The HOTP algorithm, as defined in [RFC4226] is based on an increasing
   counter value and a static symmetric key known only to the prover and
   verifier parties.

   As a reminder:
                     HOTP(K,C) = Truncate(HMAC-SHA1(K,C))

   Where Truncate represents the function that converts an HMAC-SHA-1
   value into an HOTP value.

   We refer the reader to [RFC4226] for the full description and further
   details on the rationale and security analysis of HOTP.

   The present draft describes the different variants based on similar
   constructions as HOTP.


5.  Definition of OCRA

   OCRA is a generalization of HOTP with variable data inputs not solely
   based on an incremented counter and secret key values.

   The definition of OCRA requires a cryptographic function, a key K and
   a set of DataInput parameters.  This section first formally
   introduces the OCRA algorithm and then introduces the definitions and
   default values recommended for all parameters.

   In a nutshell,
                     OCRA = CryptoFunction(K, DataInput)

   Where:

   o  K: a shared secret key known to both parties
   o  DataInput: a structure that contains the concatenation of the
      various input data values defined in details in section 5.1
   o  CryptoFunction: this is the function performing the OCRA
      computation from the secret key K and the DataInput material;
   CryptoFunction is described in details in section Section 5.2

5.1.  DataInput Parameters

   This structure is the concatenation over byte array of the OCRASuite
   value as defined in section 6 with the different parameters used in
   the computation, save for the secret key K.

   DataInput = {OCRASuite | 00 | C | Q | P | S | T} where:

   o  OCRASuite is a value representing the suite of operations to
      compute an OCRA response
   o  00 is a byte value used as a separator
   o  C is an unsigned 8-byte counter value processed high-order bit
      first, and MUST be synchronized between all parties; It loops
      around from "{Hex}0" to "{Hex}FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF" and then starts
      over at "{Hex}0"
   o  Q, mandatory, is a 128-byte list of (concatenated) challenge
      question(s) generated by the parties; if Q is less than 128 bytes,
      then it should be padded with zeroes to the right

Internet-Draft                    OCRA                        March 2010


   o  P is a hash (SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512 are supported) value of PIN/
      password that is known to all parties during the execution of the
      algorithm; the length of P will depend on the hash function that
      is used
   o  S is an UTF-8 encoded string of length upto 512 bytes that
      contains information about the current session; the length of S is
      defined in the OCRASuite string
   o  T is an 8-byte unsigned integer in big endian (i.e. network byte
      order) representing the number of time-steps(seconds, minutes,
      hours or days depending on the specified granularity) since
      midnight UTC of January 1, 1970.  More specificatlly, if the OCRA
      computation includes a timestamp T, you SHOULD first convert your
      current local time to UTC time (text form); you can then derive
      the UTC time in the proper format (i.e. seconds, minutes, hours or
      days elapsed from Epoch time); the size of the time-step is
      defined in the OCRASuite string

   When computing a response, the concatenation order is always the
   following:


                                    C |


                OTHER-PARTY-GENERATED-CHALLENGE-QUESTION |


                    YOUR-GENERATED-CHALLENGE-QUESTION |


                                 P| S | T


   If a value is empty (i.e. a certain input is not used in the
   computation) then the value is simply not represented in the string.

   The counter on the token or client MUST be incremented every time a
   new computation is requested by the user.  The server's counter value
   MUST only be incremented after a successful OCRA authentication.

5.2.  CryptoFunction

   The default CryptoFunction is HOTP-SHA1-6, i.e. the default mode of
   computation for OCRA is HOTP with the default 6-digit dynamic
   truncation and a combination of DataInput values as the message to
   compute the HMAC-SHA1 digest.

   As indicated in section 5.1, we denote t as the length in digits of



M'Raihi, et al.         Expires September 7, 2010               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                    OCRA                        March 2010


   the truncation output.  For instance, if t = 6, then the output of
   the truncation is a 6-digit value.

   We define the HOTP family of functions as an extension to HOTP:

   1.  HOTP-H-t: these are the different possible truncated versions of
       HOTP, using the dynamic truncation method for extracting an HOTP
       value from the HMAC output
   2.  We will denote HOTP-H-t as the realization of an HOTP function
       that uses an HMAC function with the hash function H, and the
       dynamic truncation as described in [RFC 4226] to extract a t-
       digit value
   3.  t=0 means that no truncation is performed and the full HMAC value
       is used for authentication purpose

   We list the following preferred modes of computation, where * denotes
   the default CryptoFunction:

   o  HOTP-SHA1-4: HOTP with SHA-1 as the hash function for HMAC and a
      dynamic truncation to a 4-digit value; this mode is not
      recommended in the general case but can be useful when a very
      short authentication code is needed by an application
   o  HOTP-SHA1-6: HOTP with SHA-1 as the hash function for HMAC and a
      dynamic truncation to a 6-digit value
   o  HOTP-SHA1-8: HOTP with SHA-1 as the hash function for HMAC and a
      dynamic truncation to an 8-digit value
   o  HOTP-SHA256-6: HOTP with SHA-256 as the hash function for HMAC and
      a dynamic truncation to a 6-digit value
   o  HOTP-SHA512-6: HOTP with SHA-512 as the hash function for HMAC and
      a dynamic truncation to a 6-digit value

   This table summarizes all possible values for the CryptoFunction:

     +---------------+--------------------+-------------------------+
     |      Name     | HMAC Function Used |  Size of Truncation (t) |
     +---------------+--------------------+-------------------------+
     |  HOTP-SHA1-t  |      HMAC-SHA1     | 0 (no truncation), 4-10 |
     | HOTP-SHA256-t |     HMAC-SHA256    | 0 (no truncation), 4-10 |
     | HOTP-SHA512-t |     HMAC-SHA512    | 0 (no truncation), 4-10 |
     +---------------+--------------------+-------------------------+

6.  The OCRASuite

   An OCRASuite value is a text string that captures one mode of
   operation for the OCRA algorithm, completely specifying the various

Internet-Draft                    OCRA                        March 2010


   options for that computation.  An OCRASuite value is represented as
   follows:
                     Algorithm:CryptoFunction:DataInput

   The client and server need to agree on one or two values of
   OCRASuite.  These values may be agreed at time of token provisioning
   or for more sophisticated client-server interactions these values may
   be negotiated for every transaction.

   Note that for Mutual Challenge-Response or Signature with Server
   Authentication modes, the client and server will need to agree on two
   values of OCRASuite - one for server computation and another for
   client computation.

6.1.  Algorithm

   Description: Indicates the version of OCRA algorithm.

   Values: OCRA-v where v represents the version number (e.g. 1, 2
   etc.).  This document specifies version 1 of the OCRA algorithm.

6.2.  CryptoFunction

   Description: Indicates the function used to compute OCRA values

   Values: Permitted values are described in section 5.2

6.3.  DataInput

   Description: This component of the OCRASuite string captures the list
   of valid inputs for that computation; [] indicates a value is
   optional:

   [C] | QFxx | [PH | Snnn | TG] : Challenge-Response computation

   [C] | QFxx | [PH | TG] : Plain Signature computation

   Each input that is used for the computation is represented by a
   single letter (except Q) and they are separated by a hyphen.

   The input for challenge is further qualified by the formats supported
   by the client for challenge question(s).  Supported values can be:

                 +------------------+-------------------+
                 |    Format (F)    | Up to Length (xx) |
                 +------------------+-------------------+
                 | A (alphanumeric) |       04-64       |
                 |    N (numeric)   |       04-64       |
                 |  H (hexadecimal) |       04-64       |
                 +------------------+-------------------+

                      Table 2: Challenge Format Table

   The default challenge format is N08, numeric and upto 8 digits.

   The input for P is further qualified by the hash function used for
   the PIN/password.  Supported values for hash function can be:

   Hash function (H) - SHA1, SHA256, SHA512.

   The default hash function for P is SHA1.

   The input for S is further qualified by the length of the session
   data in bytes.  The client and server could agree to any length but
   the typical values are:

   Length (nnn) - 064, 128, 256 and 512.

   The default length is 064 bytes.

   The input for timestamps is further qualified by G, size of the time-
   step.  G can be specified in number of seconds, minutes or hours:

           +--------------------+-----------------------------+
           | Time-step Size (G) |           Examples          |
           +--------------------+-----------------------------+
           |       [1-59]S      | number of seconds, e.g. 20S |
           |       [1-59]M      |  number of minutes, e.g. 5M |
           |       [0-48]H      |  number of hours, e.g. 24H  |
           +--------------------+-----------------------------+

                       Table 3: Time-step Size Table

   Default value for G is 1M, i.e. time step size is one minute and the
   T represents the number of minutes since Epoch time.

   Here are some examples of OCRASuite strings:
   o  OCRA-1:HOTP-SHA512-8:C-QN08-PSHA1 means version 1 of the OCRA
      algorithm with HMAC-SHA512 function, truncated to an 8-digit
      value, using the counter, a random challenge and a SHA1 digest of
      the PIN/Password as parameters.  It also indicates that the client

      supports only numeric challenge upto 8 digits in length
   o  OCRA-1:HOTP-SHA256-6:QA10-T1M means version 1 of the OCRA
      algorithm with HMAC-SHA256 function, truncated to a 6-digit value,
      using a random alphanumeric challenge upto 10 characters in length
      and a timestamp in number of minutes since Epoch time
   o  OCRA-1:HOTP-SHA1-4:QH8-S512 means version 1 of the OCRA algorithm

7.  Algorithm Modes for Authentication

   This section describes the typical modes in which the above defined
   computation can be used for authentication.

7.1.  One way Challenge-Response

   A challenge/response is a security mechanism in which the verifier
   presents a question (challenge) to the prover who must provide a
   valid answer (response) to be authenticated.

   To use this algorithm for a one-way challenge-response, the verifier
   will communicate a challenge value (typically randomly generated) to
   the prover.  The prover will use the challenge in the computation as
   described above.  The prover then communicates the response to the
   verifier to authenticate.

   Therefore in this mode, the typical data inputs will be:
      C - Counter, optional.
      Q - Challenge question, mandatory, supplied by the verifier.
      P - Hashed version of PIN/password, optional.
      S - Session information, optional.
      T - Timestamp, optional.

   The diagram below shows the message exchange between the client
   (prover) and the server (verifier) to complete a one-way challenge-
   response authentication.

   It is assumed that the client and server have a pre-shared key K that
   is used for the computation.

7.2.  Mutual Challenge-Response

   Mutual challenge-response is a variation of one-way challenge-
   response where both the client and server mutually authenticate each
   other.

   To use this algorithm, the client will first send a random client-
   challenge to the server.  The server computes the server-response and
   sends it to the client along with a server-challenge.

   The client will first verify the server-response to be assured that
   it is talking to a valid server.  It will then compute the client-
   response and send it to the server to authenticate.  The server
   verifies the client-response to complete the two-way authentication
   process.

   In this mode there are two computations: client-response and server-
   response.  There are two separate challenge questions, generated by
   both parties.  We denote these challenge questions Q1 and Q2.

   Typical data inputs for server-response computation will be:
      C - Counter, optional.
      QC - Challenge question, mandatory, supplied by the client.
      QS - Challenge question, mandatory, supplied by the server.
      S - Session information, optional.
      T - Timestamp, optional.

   Typical data inputs for client-response computation will be:

      S - Session information, optional.
      T - Timestamp, optional.

   The following picture shows the messages that are exchanged between
   the client and the server to complete a two-way mutual challenge-
   response authentication.

   It is assumed that the client and server have a pre-shared key K (or
   pair of keys if using dual-key mode of computation) that is used for
   the computation.

   In this section we describe the typical modes in which the above
   defined computation can be used for digital signatures.

7.3.1.  Plain Signature

   To use this algorithm in plain signature mode, the server will
   communicate a signature-challenge value to the client (signer).  The
   signature-challenge is either the data to be signed or derived from
   the data to be signed using a hash function, for example.

   The client will use the signature-challenge in the computation as
   described above.  The client then communicates the signature value
   (response) to the server to authenticate.

   Therefore in this mode, the data inputs will be:
      C - Counter, optional.
      QS - Signature-challenge, mandatory, supplied by the server.
      P - Hashed version of PIN/password, optional.
      T - Timestamp, optional.

   The picture below shows the messages that are exchanged between the
   client (prover) and the server (verifier) to complete a plain
   signature operation.

   It is assumed that the client and server have a pre-shared key K that
   is used for the computation.

               |    Response = SIGN                        |

7.3.2.  Signature with Server Authentication

   This mode is a variation of the plain signature mode where the client
   can first authenticates the server before generating a digital
   signature.

   To use this algorithm, the client will first send a random client-

   challenge to the server.  The server computes the server-response and
   sends it to the client along with a signature-challenge.

   The client will first verify the server-response to authenticate that
   it is talking to a valid server.  It will then compute the signature
   and send it to the server.

   In this mode there are two computations: client-signature and server-
   response.

   Typical data inputs for server-response computation will be:
      C - Counter, optional.
      QC - Challenge question, mandatory, supplied by the client.
      QS - Signature-challenge, mandatory, supplied by the server.
      T - Timestamp, optional.

   Typical data inputs for client-signature computation will be:

      QC - Challenge question, mandatory, supplied by the client.
      QS - Signature-challenge, mandatory, supplied by the server.
      P - Hashed version of PIN/password, optional.
      T - Timestamp, optional.

   The diagram below shows the messages that are exchanged between the
   client and the server to complete a signature with server

   the computation.

8.  Security Considerations

   Any algorithm is only as secure as the application and the
   authentication protocols that implement it.  Therefore, this section
   discusses the critical security requirements that our choice of
   algorithm imposes on the authentication protocol and validation
   software.

8.1.  Security Analysis of the OCRA algorithm

   The security and strength of this algorithm depends on the properties
   of the underlying building block HOTP, which is a construction based
   on HMAC [RFC2104] using SHA-1 as the hash function.

   The conclusion of the security analysis detailed in [RFC4226] is
   that, for all practical purposes, the outputs of the dynamic
   truncation on distinct counter inputs are uniformly and independently
   distributed strings.

   The analysis demonstrates that the best possible attack against the



M'Raihi, et al.         Expires September 7, 2010              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                    OCRA                        March 2010


   HOTP function is the brute force attack.

8.2.  Implementation Considerations

   IC1 - In the authentication mode, the client MUST support two- factor
   authentication, i.e., the communication and verification of something
   you know (secret code such as a Password, Pass phrase, PIN code,
   etc.) and something you have (token).  The secret code is known only
   to the user and usually entered with the Response value for
   authentication purpose (two-factor authentication).  Alternatively,
   instead of sending something you know to the server, the client may
   use a hash of the Password or PIN code in the computation itself,
   thus implicitly enabling two-factor authentication.

   IC2 - Keys should be of the length of the CryptoFunction output to
   facilitate interoperability.

   IC3 - Keys SHOULD be chosen at random or using a cryptographically
   strong pseudo-random generator properly seeded with a random value.
   We RECOMMEND following the recommendations in [RFC1750] for all
   pseudo-random and random generations.  The pseudo-random numbers used
   for generating the keys SHOULD successfully pass the randomness test
   specified in [CN].

   IC4 - Challenge questions SHOULD be 20-byte values and MUST be at
   least t-byte values where t stands for the digit-length of the OCRA
   truncation output.

   IC5 - On the client side, the keys SHOULD be embedded in a tamper
   resistant device or securely implemented in a software application.
   Additionally, by embedding the keys in a hardware device, you also
   have the advantage of improving the flexibility (mobility) of the
   authentication system.

   IC6 - We RECOMMEND following the recommendations in [RFC1750] for all
   pseudo-random and random challenge generations.

   IC7 - All the communications SHOULD take place over a secure channel
   e.g.  SSL/TLS, IPsec connections.

   IC8 - The OCRA algorithm when used in mutual authentication mode or
   in signature with server authentication mode MAY use dual key mode -
   i.e. there are two keys that are shared between the client and the
   server.  One shared key is used to generate the server response on
   the server side and to verify it on the client side.  The other key
   is used to create the response or signature on the client side and to
   verify it on the server side.

Internet-Draft                    OCRA                        March 2010


   IC9 - We recommend that implementations MAY use the session
   information, S as an additional input in the computation.  For
   example, S could be the session identifier from the TLS session.
   This will enable you to counter certain types of man-in-the-middle
   attacks.  However, this will introduce the additional dependency that
   first of all the prover needs to have access to the session
   identifier to compute the response and the verifier will need access
   to the session identifier to verify the response.

   IC10 - In the signature mode, whenever the counter or time (defined
   as optional elements) are not used in the computation, there might be
   a risk of replay attack and the implementers should carefully
   consider this issue in the light of their specific application
   requirements and security guidelines.  The server SHOULD also provide
   whenever possible a mean for the client (if able) to verify the
   validity of the signature challenge.

   IC11 - We also RECOMMEND storing the keys securely in the validation
   system, and more specifically encrypting them using tamper-resistant
   hardware encryption and exposing them only when required: for
   example, the key is decrypted when needed to verify an OCRA response,
   and re-encrypted immediately to limit exposure in the RAM for a short
   period of time.  The key store MUST be in a secure area, to avoid as
   much as possible direct attack on the validation system and secrets
   database.  Particularly, access to the key material should be limited
   to programs and processes required by the validation system only.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


10.  Conclusion

   This draft introduced several variants of HOTP for challenge-
   response based authentication and short signature-like computations.

   The OCRASuite provides for an easy integration and support of
   different flavors within an authentication and validation system.

   Finally, OCRA should enable mutual authentication both in connected
   and off-line modes, with the support of different response sizes and
   mode of operations.
