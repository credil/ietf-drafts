		<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
			<t>
			The Internet is being recognized as a critical infrastructure similar in nature to
			the power grid and a potable water supply.  Just like those infrastructures, means are
			needed to provide resiliency and adaptability to the Internet so that it remains
			consistently available to the public throughout the world even during times of 
			duress or attack.  For this reason, many SDOs are
			developing standards with hopes of retaining an acceptable level, or even improving
			this availability, to its users.
			These SDO efforts usually define themselves as "security" efforts.  It is the opinion
			of the authors that there are many different definitions of the term "security" and
			it may be applied in many diverse ways.  As such, we offer no assurance that the
			term is applied consistently throughout this document.
			</t>

			<t>
			Many of these SDOs have diverse charters and goals and will take entirely different
			directions in their efforts to provide standards.  However, even with that, there
			will be overlaps in their produced works.  If there are overlaps then there is a
			potential for conflicts and confusion.  This may result in:
			<list>
				<t>
				Vendors of networking equipment who are unsure of which standard to follow.
				</t>
				<t>
				Purchasers of networking equipment who are unsure of which standard will
				best apply to the needs of their business or ogranization.
				</t>
				<t>
				Network Administrators and Operators unsure of which standard to follow
				to attain the best security for their network.
				</t>
			</list>
			For these reasons, the authors wish to encourage all SDOs who have an interest
			in producing or in consuming standards relating to good security practices to
			be consistent in their approach and their recommendations.  In many cases, the
			authors are aware that the SDOs are making good efforts along these lines.  
			However, the authors do not participate in all SDO efforts and cannot know 
			everything that is happening.
			</t>
			
			<t>
			The OpSec Working Group met at the 61st IETF and agreed that this document
			could be a useful reference in producing the documents described in the
			Working Group Charter.  The authors have agreed to keep this document current
			and request that those who read it will submit corrections or comments.

			The first part of the body of this document, <xref target="glossaries" />, 
                        contains a listing of online glossaries relating to networking
			and security.  It is very important that the definitions of words relating to
			security and security events be consistent.  Inconsistencies between the useage
			of words on standards is unacceptable as it would prevent a reader of two 
			standards to appropriately relate their recommendations.  The authors of this
			document have not reviewed the definitions of the words in the listed glossaries
			so can offer no assurance of their alignment.

			The second part, <xref target="sdo" />, contains a listing of SDOs 
                        that appear to be working on security standards.

From broadband Internet to latest-generation wireless technologies, from aeronautical and maritime navigation to radio astronomy and satellite-based meteorology, from convergence in fixed-mobile phone, Internet access, data, voice and TV broadcasting to next-generation networks, ITU is committed to connecting the world. 
</t>
				<t>
				The ITU is comprised of three sectors:
				</t>
				<section anchor="itut" title="ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector - ITU-T">
					<t>
					http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/
					</t>
					<t>
ITU-T Recommendations are defining elements in information and communication technologies (ICTs) infrastructure. Whether we exchange voice, data or video messages, communications cannot take place without standards linking the sender and the receiver. Today’s work extends well beyond the traditional areas of telephony to encompass a far wider range of information and communications technologies.

				</section>
				<section anchor="itur" title="ITU Radiocommunication Sector - ITU-R">
					<t>
					http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/
					</t>
					<t>
The ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) plays a vital role in the global management of the radio-frequency spectrum and satellite orbits - limited natural resources which are increasingly in demand from a large and growing number of services such as fixed, mobile, broadcasting, amateur, space research, emergency telecommunications, meteorology, global positioning systems, environmental monitoring and communication services - that ensure safety of life on land, at sea and in the skies.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential.
				</t>
				<t>
				http://www.w3.org/Security/Activity
				</t>
				<t>
The work in the W3C Security Activity currently comprises two Working Groups, the Web Security Context Working Group and the XML Security Working Group.
</t><t>
The Web Security Context Working Group focuses on the challenges that arise when users encounter currently deployed security technology, such as TLS: While this technology achieves its goals on a technical level, attackers' strategies shift towards bypassing the security technology instead of breaking it. When users do not understand the security context in which they operate, then it becomes easy to deceive and defraud them. This Working Group is planning to see its main deliverable, the User Interface Guidelines, through to Recommendation, but will not engage in additional recommendation track work beyond this deliverable. The Working Group is currently operating at reduced Team effort (compared to the initial effort reserved to this Working Group). Initial (and informal) conversations about forming an Interest Group that could serve as a place for community-building and specification review have not led as far as we had hoped at the previous Advisory Committee Meeting, but are still on the Team's agenda.
</t><t>
The XML Security Working Group started up in summer 2008, and has decided to publish an interim set of 1.1 specifications as it works towards producing a more radical change to XML Signature. The XML Signature 1.1 and XML Encryption 1.1 specifications clarify and enhance the previous specifications without introducing breaking changes, although they do introduce new algorithms.

				Abstract: This standard contains a set of baseline security requirements for the 
				management plane.  The President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory 
				Committee Network Security Information Exchange (NSIE) and Government NSIE jointly 
				established a Security Requirements Working Group (SRWG) to examine the security 
				requirements for controlling access to the public switched network, in particular 
				with respect to the emerging next generation network.  In the telecommunications 
				industry, this access incorporates operation, administration, maintenance, and 
				provisioning for network elements and various supporting systems and databases.  
				Members of the SRWG, from a cross-section of telecommunications carriers and 
				vendors, developed an initial list of security requirements that would allow 
				vendors, government departments and agencies, and service providers to implement 
				a secure telecommunications network management infrastructure.  This initial list 
				of security requirements was submitted as a contribution to Committee 
				T1 - Telecommunications, Working Group T1M1.5 for consideration as a standard.  
				The requirements outlined in this document will allow vendors, government 
				departments and agencies, and service providers to implement a secure 
				telecommunications network management infrastructure.

				in telecommunications and information technologies, describe practical issues, 
				and indicate how the different aspects of security in today's applications are 
				addressed by ITU-T Recommendations. This manual has a tutorial character: it 
				collects security related material from ITU-T Recommendations into one place 
				and explains the respective relationships. The intended audience for this 
				manual are engineers and product managers, students and academia, as well as 
				regulators who want to better understand security aspects in practical
