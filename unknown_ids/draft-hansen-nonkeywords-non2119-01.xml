    <abstract>
      <t>Specifications can contain normative keywords, as defined in RFC
        2119, to signify requirements, permission or prohibitions. 
	They include MUST, SHOULD and MAY, which are commonly spelled in 
	all CAPITALS (but need not be). 
	These words can also be used for non-normative purposes.
        However when used within an RFC this is confusing, given their typical 
	use as normative vocabulary, even when they do not formally have normative import. 
      </t>
      <t>
	Several words and phrases are specified in this document for non-normative purposes
	as alternatives to the normative vocabulary of RFC 2119. 
	Authors who follow these guidelines do NOT need to incorporate any 
	declaration at the beginning of their document.

    <section title="A List of Synonyms">
      <t> To indicate a degree of requirement, permission or prohibition for
        an aspect of a specification, words such as MUST, SHOULD and MAY are
        defined as normative vocabulary in the culture of RFCs.<xref target="RFC2119"/>. 
	However it is also natural to use them non-normatively, in a narrative fashion. 
	Even when this is permitted,
        such as RFCs that do not invoke the conventions of RFC 2119,
        non-normative use of these words can be confusing;
	their normative meaning is too deeply ingrained for RFCs.
      </t>
      <t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>. 
      </t>
      <t>Fortunately, there are other words readily available, in lieu of the
        RFC 2119 words.
        <list>
          <t><list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="MUST, REQUIRED, SHALL:">The words "needs to" and
                "necessary" can be used to connote that something is essential. 
	      </t>
              <t hangText="SHOULD, RECOMMENDED:">The words "ought", "encouraged"
                and "suggest strongly" can be used to connote something that is 
		strongly urged. 
	      </t>
              <t hangText="MAY, OPTIONAL:">The words "can" and "might" can be used 
		to indicate the possibility of or ability for an action.
		The words "is allowed to" or "is permitted to" can be used to 
		indicate permission for an action.
	      </t>
              <t hangText="NOT:">The word "not" may be freely used with any of
                the above suggestions and will not be taken to have any separate
                2119 connotation. 
		The word only takes on a special meaning when it is combined with 
		one of the RFC 2119 words.
		For example, "ought not" is non-normative, while "should not" and
		"SHOULD NOT" are normative in the RFC 2119 sense.

      <t> 
	The 2119 terms are frequently used to specify behavior with security
        implications. 
	The effects on security of changing something from a
        "MUST" to a "needs to", or vice versa, can be very subtle, as one has
        normative meaning and the other does not. 
	Document authors should take
        the time to consider the effects of using non-normative verbiage as
        specified in this document instead of the normative verbiage from
        2119.
