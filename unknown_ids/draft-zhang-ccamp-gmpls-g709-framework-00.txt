1. Introduction 

   OTN is becoming a mainstream support technology for the backbone 
   transport network and the metropolitan core transport layer. It is 
   desirable for operators to introduce control plane such as 
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) to the OTN 
   networks, because GMPLS can improve the network reliability through 
   restoration mechanisms (e.g., resist multiple failures) and resource 
   usage efficiency through mesh-shared.    

   GMPLS extends MPLS to encompass time division multiplexing (TDM) 
   networks (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, and G.709 digital wrapper), lambda 
   switching optical networks, and spatial switching (e.g., incoming 
   port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber). [RFC3945] provides the 
   architecture of GMPLS. For GMPLS networks, signaling, routing and 
   link management are the basic modules. The signaling function and 
   Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) 
   extensions are described in [RFC3471] and [RFC3473]. The routing 
   extensions and OSPF extensions are described in [RFC4202] and 
   [RFC4203]. The link management protocol is described in [RFC4204].  

   The existing GMPLS protocol suite can provide the basic principle for 
   GMPLS control of OTN networks. However, there is some difference 
   between normal TDM networks (e.g., SDH/Sonet) and OTN networks 
   (especially for OTN digital wrapper), because some new features are 
   introduce recently in ITU-T, for example, various multiplexed 
   structure, two types of Tributary Slot (i.e., 1.25Gbps and 2.5Gbps) 
   and the ODUk definition has been extended to include the ODUflex 
   function.  

   Therefore, this document reviews the OTN technology and provides a 
   framework for applying GMPLS and PCE architecture to the control of 
   OTN networks. 

   Note that G.709 OTN can be divided into two layers roughly, which are 
   digital wrapper layer and wavelength layer, in this document, it only

   scope. Please refer to [WSON-Frame] for further information.

3. G.709 Optical Transport Network (OTN) 

   This section provides an overview of G.709 Optical Transport Network 
   based on ITU-T G.709 related recommendations. [ITUT-G872] describes 
   the functional architecture of optical transport networks providing 
   optical signal transmission, multiplexing, routing, supervision, 
   performance assessment, and network survivability. [ITUT-G709] 
   defines the interfaces of the optical transport network to be used 
   within and between subnetworks of the optical network. With the 
   evolution and deployment of G.709 technology many new features are 
   defined in ITU-T recommendations. For example, ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 
   containers and ODUflex are described in [G709-V3], ODU3e1, ODU3e2 are 
   described in [Gsup43]. 
    
   The purpose of this section is to provide some background and basic 
   reference about OTN technology and then determine how the current 
   GMPLS protocol suit and the PCE architecture can be accommodated to 
   encompass the OTN. For the detailed OTN related technical information 
   please refers to the ITU-T recommendations. 
    
3.1. OTN Layer Network 

   The basic structure of OTN is shown in Figure 1. Three layer networks 
   are illustrated which include optical channel layer (OCh), section 
   layers: OMSn (Optical Multiplex section) and OTNn (Optical 
   Transmission Section), and single channel section layer: OPSn 
   (optical physical section). 
   OCh substructure indicated by Figure 1 consists of  
   -  Analogue layer (OCh/OChr): The optical channel with full (OCh) or 
      reduced functionality (OChr), which provides transparent network 
      connections between 3R regeneration points in the OTN. 
   -  Digital layer (OTU): The completely or functionally standardized 
      optical channel transport unit (OTUk/OTUkV) which provides

      supervision and conditions the signal for transport between 3R 
      regeneration points in the OTN. 
   -  Digital layer (ODU/OPU): The optical channel data unit (ODUk) 
      which provides: 
      o  tandem connection monitoring (ODUkT); 
      o  end-to-end path supervision (ODUkP); and 
      o  adaptation of client signals via the Optical Channel Payload 
         Unit (OPUk)

3.1.1.1. Optical channel Layer network (OCh) 

   The OCh transports a digital client signal between 3R regeneration 
   points. The OCh client signals defined in [ITUT-G709] are the OTUk 
   signals. Optical Transport Module (OTM-n.m, OTM-nr.m, OTM-0.m, OTM-
   0.mvn) is described in [ITUT-G709] in detail.

3.1.1.3. Optical transmission section layer network (OTS) 

   The optical transmission section layer network provides for the 
   transport of an optical multiplex section through an optical 
   transmission section trail between access points. 

3.1.2. Digital layer 

3.1.2.1. Optical channel transport unit (OTU) 

   The OTUk conditions the ODUk for transport over an optical channel 
   network connection.  

   Currently, the following OTUk types are defined: OTU1, OTU2, OTU3, 
   OTU4, OTU2e, OTU3e1, OTU3e2. OTUk has a bandwidth/bit rate BR and a 
   bit rate tolerance T i.e. OTU(BR,T). The detailed bit rates and 
   tolerance of the OTUk signals are defined in [ITUT-G709], [Gsup43] 
   and [G709-V3]. 

    
3.1.2.2. Optical channel data unit (ODUk) 

   The optical channel data unit (ODUk) provides adaptation of client 
   signals via the Optical Channel Payload Unit (OPUk) LO ODU (Lower 
   order ODU) can be multiplexed into HO ODU (higher order ODU), which 
   is described in section 3.2.2. 

   Currently, the following ODUk types are defined: ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, 
   ODU3, ODU4, ODU2e, ODUflex, ODU3e1, ODU3e2. ODUk has a bandwidth/bit 
   rate BR and a bit rate tolerance T i.e. ODU(BR,T). The detailed bit 
   rates and tolerance of the ODUk signals (except ODUflex) are defined 
   in [ITUT-G709], [Gsup43] and [G709-V3]. The bitrate and tolerance of 
   the ODUflex is dependent on the client signal. 
    
   HO ODUk types are: ODU1, ODU2, ODU3, ODU4, ODU3e1, ODU3e2. 
    
   LO ODUk types are: ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e, ODU3, ODU4, ODUflex. 
   ODU3e1 and ODU3e2 can be treated as LO ODU signals outside the domain 
   in which these signals terminate.

3.1.2.3. Optical channel payload unit (OPUk) 

   The OPUk encapsulates the Client signal (e.g. SONET/SDH, Ethernet 
   bit/codeword streams, Ethernet VLANs) and fulfils any rate 
   justification that is needed. It is mapped at the source, demapped at 
   the sink, and not modified by the network. 

   Currently, the following OPUk types are defined: OPU0, OPU1, OPU2, 
   OPU3, OPU4, OPU2e, OPUflex, OPU3e1, OPU3e2. OPUk has a bandwidth/bit 
   rate BR and a bit rate tolerance T i.e. OPU(BR,T). The detailed bit 
   rates and tolerance of the OPUk signals are defined in [ITUT-G709], 
   [Gsup43] and [G709-V3]. 
    
3.2. Mapping/Multiplexing 

   From the perspective of digital and analogue layers, there are two 
   processes for the mapping and multiplexing. 
    
   One process is that a (non-OTN) client signal is mapped into a lower 
   order OPU, which will be mapped into the associated LO ODU. The LO 
   ODU signal can be either mapped into the associated OTU[V] signal, or 
   into an ODTU, which will be multiplexed into an ODTU Group (ODTUG). 
   The ODTUG signal is mapped into a higher order OPU, and the HO OPU 
   signal is then mapped into the associated HO ODU, which will be 
   mapped into the associated OTU[V]. Therefore a LO ODU may be carried 
   either directly over an OCh or over a HO ODU. 

   A HO ODU may be treated in a second domain as a LO ODU, and be mapped 
   in that domain in to an ODTU. For interworking with OTN networks 
   based on the 2003 version of G.709, this mapping of a HO ODU into 
   another HO ODU may occur within one domain for the cases of ODU0 -> 
   ODU1 -> ODU2, ODU0 -> ODU1 -> ODU3, ODU0 -> ODU2 -> ODU3 and ODUflex 
   -> ODU2 -> ODU3. 

   The other process is that an OTU[V] signal is mapped either into an 
   Optical Channel signal (i.e., OCh and OChr), or into an OTLk.n. The 
   OCh/OChr signal is mapped into an Optical Channel Carrier (i.e., OCC 
   and OCCr). The OCC/OCCr signal is multiplexed into an OCC Group, 
   identified as OCG-n.m and OCG-nr.m. The OCG-n.m signal is mapped into 
   an OMSn. The OMSn signal is mapped into an OTSn. The OTSn signal is

   signal is multiplexed into an OTLC Group, identified as OTLCG. The 
   OTLCG signal is mapped into an OPSMnk. The OPSMnk signal is presented 
   at the OTM-0.mvn interface. 

   The detailed multiplexing and mapping structures are described in 
   [ITUT-G709], [Gsup43] and [G709-V3]. 

    
3.2.1. Mapping 

   There are several kinds of mapping. For example, the client signal or 
   an Optical channel Data Tributary Unit Group (ODTUGk) is mapped into 
   the OPUk. The OPUk is mapped into an ODUk and the ODUk is mapped into 
   an OTUk[V]. The OTUk[V] is mapped into an OCh[r] and the OCh[r] is 
   then modulated onto an OCC[r]. 

    
3.2.1.1. Mapping of client signals 

   OPUk supports mapping of various of client signals like CBR2G5, 
   CBR10G, CBR10G3, CBR10G3 and CBR40G signals, ATM cell stream, GFP 
   encapsulated IP, MPLS, Ethernet packet/frame streams, test signal, 
   fibre channel, etc, which are described in [ITUT-G709] in more detail. 

3.2.1.2. Other mapping relationships  

   OTN supports other mapping like ODUj into ODTUjk or ODTUk.ts, ODTU 
   into OPUk, etc. which are described in [ITUT-G709] and [G709-V3] in 
   more detail. 

3.2.2. Multiplexing 

   OTN has a multi stage multiplexing capability including one or more 
   TDM stages and one WDM stage which are introduced in the following 
   sections. 
    
3.2.2.1. ODUk Time-Division Multiplex 

   LO ODU can be multiplexed into HO ODU, the process is as follows: LO 
   ODU signal is mapped into an ODTU, which will be multiplexed into an 
   ODTU Group (ODTUG). And then the ODTUG signal is mapped into a higher 
   order OPU, which then is mapped into the associated HO ODU. 
   In this process, multiplexing an ODTU into an OPU is realized by 
   means of the mapping of the ODTU signal in one or several OPU 
   Tributary Slots. This section is only concerned about multiplexing

   process not mapping process. This section describes the means of 
   Tributary Slot allocation when multiplexing LO ODU into HO ODU. 
    
    
3.2.2.1.1. Tributary Slot introduction 

   The OPUk is divided in a number of Tributary Slots (TS) and these 
   Tributary Slots are interleaved within the OPUk. There are two types 
   of Tributary Slots: 
   1. Tributary Slot with a bandwidth of approximately 2.5 Gbps 
      introduced in [ITUT-G709]; an OPUk is divided in n Tributary Slots, 
      numbered 1 to n. 
   2. Tributary Slot with a bandwidth of approximately 1.25 Gbps 
      introduced in [G709-V3]; an OPUk is divided in 2n Tributary Slots, 
      numbered 1 to 2n. 
    
   Equipment supporting a 1.25Gbps TS structure for OPU2 or OPU3 must be 
   backward compatible with equipment which supports only the 2.5G TS 
   structure. Specific Tributary Slots must be combined together (e.g., 
   combination of TS#i and TS#i+4 on an HO ODU2 link) for the LO ODU at 
   one end of the HO ODU link which supports the 1.25Gbps TS structure, 
   so that the LO ODU can be carried on the HO ODU link correctly. 

   In the following example, suppose that the two ends of an ODU2 or 
   ODU3 link support different TS structure, where node A supports the 
   1.25Gbps TS structure, while node B supports the 2.5Gbps TS, as shown 
   in the figure below: 

          +-----+                            +-----+ 
          |     |                            |     | 
          |  A  +-------ODU2/ODU3 link-------+  B  | 
          |     |                            |     | 
          +-----+                            +-----+ 
     (Support 1.25G TS)                  (Support 2.5G TS) 
    

   o  In case of ODU1 multiplexing into ODU2, node A maps the ODU1 into 
      the TS#i and TS#i+4 (where i<=4) (with the granularity of 1.25Gbps) 
      of OPU2, so that node B can retrieve the ODU1 from the TS#i (with 
      the granularity of 2.5Gbps) of the OPU2, and vice versa. 

   o  In case of ODU1 multiplexing into ODU3, node A maps the ODU1 into 
      the TS#i and TS#i+16 (where i<=16) (with the granularity of

      1.25Gbps) of OPU3, so that node B can retrieve the ODU1 from the 
      TS#i (with the granularity of 2.5Gbps) of the OPU3, and vice versa. 

   o  In case of ODU2 multiplexing into ODU3, node A maps the ODU2 into 
      the TS#a/TS#a+16, TS#b/TS#b+16, TS#c/TS#c+16 and TS#d/TS#d+16 
      (where a<b<c<d<=16) (with the granularity of 1.25Gbps) of OPU3, so 
      that node B can retrieve the ODU2 from the TS#a, TS#b, TS#c and 
      TS#d (with the granularity of 2.5Gbps) of the OPU3, and vice versa. 

    
3.2.2.1.2. Multiplexing Hierarchy 

   The multiplexing of ODUj (j = 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, flex) into an ODUk (k > 
   j) signal can be depicted as follows: 
   -  ODU0 into ODU1 multiplexing (with 1,25Gbps TS granularity) 

   -  ODU0, ODU1, ODUflex into ODU2 multiplexing (with 1.25Gbps TS 
      granularity) 

   -  ODU1 into ODU2 multiplexing (with 2.5Gbps TS granularity) 

   -  ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e and ODUflex into ODU3 multiplexing (with 
      1.25Gbps TS granularity) 

   -  ODU1, ODU2 into ODU3 multiplexing (with 2.5Gbps TS granularity) 

   -  ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e, ODU3 and ODUflex into ODU4 multiplexing 
      (with 1.25Gbps TS granularity) 

   -  ODU2e into ODU3e1 multiplexing (with 2.5Gbps TS granularity) 

   -  ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e, ODUflex into ODU3e2 multiplexing (with 
      1.25Gbps TS granularity) 

3.2.2.1.3. Tributary Slot allocation 

    
   When LO ODUj (e.g., ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU3, etc.) at different rate 
   is multiplexed into HO ODUk, it will need different amount of 
   tributary slots to be allocated in OPUk. And when LO ODUj at a 
   certain rate is multiplexed into HO ODUk, it will also need different 
   amount of tributary slots with different TS granularity to be 
   allocated in OPUk. Allocations of TS numbers for different cases are

3.2.2.1.4. Tributary Port Number assignment 

   TBD. 
    
3.2.2.2. ODUflex 

   ODUk has a bandwidth/bit rate BR and a bit rate tolerance T i.e. 
   ODU(BR,T). Compared with ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU3, ODU4 and ODU2e, 
   ODUflex has a bandwidth which is locked to the CBR client signal's 
   bandwidth or which is configurable for case of GFP encapsulated 
   packet/frame streams. This is a new feature of OTN specified in 
   [G709-V3]. That is, for ODUflex, BR and T are not predefined.  
   ODUflex is transported by mapping into n (n <= Total TS numbers of 
   OPUk) tributary slots of an OPUk (of a HO ODUk) for k>=1. The value 
   of n depends on the BR, T of ODUflex and the BR, T of the 
   ODU2/ODU3/ODU3e2/ODU4 which ODUflex will be multiplexed into. For 
   example, for multiplexing the ODUflex at a certain rate like ODUflex 
   (2.5G, +/-20ppm), it will need 3 of the 8 TS into ODU2, but it will 
   only need 2 of the 32 TS into ODU3. 
    
    
3.2.2.3. Wavelength division multiplex 

   Up to n (n>=1) OCC[r] are multiplexed into an OCG-n[r].m using 
   wavelength division multiplexing. The OCG-n[r].m is transported via 
   the OTM-n[r].m. For the case of the full functionality OTM-n.m 
   interfaces the OSC is multiplexed into the OTM-n.m using wavelength 
   division multiplexing. 
    
4. Connection management in OTN 

   There are four main layers in OTN: (1) OMSn/OTSn and OPSn layers (2) 
   OCh layer (3) HO ODU layer, (4) LO ODU layer. 

   As [ITUT-G872] described, OTN-based transport network equipment is 
   concerned with control of connectivity of ODU paths and optical 
   channels and not with control of connectivity of the client layer. So 
   this document focuses on the connection management of LO and HO ODU 
   paths and optical channel paths. 

   This section provides the overview of management of two layers: OCh 
   and ODU (both LO and HO).

4.1. Connection management of OCh 

   In the general case of limited or no wavelength converters, an OCh 
   connection request needs a light path from source to destination. 
   This path computation is known as the Routing and Wavelength 
   Assignment (RWA) problem [HZang00]. In the case of full wavelength 
   converters at each node, OCh path computation is equivalent to a 
   circuit-switch TDM network with full time slot interchange capability. 
   The control of connectivity of optical channels is within the scope 
   of WSON (Wavelength Switched Optical Networks) ongoing working in 
   CCAMP Working Group in IETF.  

   OCh connections are managed as part of the LO and HO ODU connection 
   set up. OCh connections do not exist outside the scope of a LO or HO 
   ODU in the OTN. 

4.2. Connection management of ODU 

   As described above, LO ODUj can be either mapped into the associated 
   OTUk signal (k = j), or multiplexed to HO ODUk (k > j), and HO ODUk 
   is mapped into an OTUk, and the OTUk is mapped into an OCh.  

   In the case of LO ODUj mapping into OTUk (k = j), Figure 2 give an 
   example of this kind of LO ODU connection. 

   In Figure 2, The LO ODUj is switched at the intermediate ODXC node. 
   From the viewpoint of connection management, when a LO ODU connection 
   is setup, the OTUk and OCh connections are setup correspondingly; i.e. 
   the OTU/OCh connection set up is slaved to the LO ODU connection set 
   up. The management of this OTUk is similar to ODU. LO ODUj and 
   OCh/OTUk have client/server relationships. 

   For example, one LO ODU1 connection can be setup between Node A and 
   Node C. When there is no HO ODU supported ODU1 links available, this 
   LO ODU1 connection is to be supported by OCh/OTU1 connections, which 
   are to be set up between Node A and Node B and between Node B and 
   Node C. LO ODU1 can be mapped into OTU1 at Node A, demapped from it 
   in Node B, switched at Node B, and then mapped into the next OTU1 and 
   demapped from this OTU1 at Node C.

                   Figure 2 Connection of LO ODUk (1) 

   In the case of LO ODUj multiplexing into HO ODUk, Figure 3 gives an 
   example of this kind of LO ODU connection. 

   In Figure 3, OCh, OTUk, HO ODUk are associated with each other. The 
   LO ODUj is multiplexed/de-multiplexed into/from the HO ODU at each 
   ODXC node and switched at each ODXC node (i.e. trib port to line port, 
   line card to line port, line port to trib port). From the viewpoint 
   of connection management, when a LO ODU connection is setup, it will 
   be using the existing HO ODUk (/OTUk/OCh) connections which have been 
   set up prior to the LO ODU service request. Those HO ODUk connections 
   provide LO ODU links, of which the LO ODU connection manager requests 
   a link connection to support the LO ODU connection. LO ODUj and 
   OCh/OTUk/HO ODUk have client/server relationships. 

   For example, one HO ODU2 (/OTU2/OCh) connection can be setup between 
   Node A and Node B, another HO ODU3 (/OTU3/OCh) connection can be 
   setup between Node B and Node C prior to any LO ODU service requests. 
   LO ODU1 can be generated at Node A, switched to one of the 10G line 
   ports and multiplexed into a HO ODU2 at Node A, demultiplexed from 
   the HO ODU2 at Node B, switched at Node B to one of the 40G line 
   ports and multiplexed into HO ODU3 at Node B, demultiplexed from HO 
   ODU3 at Node C and switched to its LO ODU1 terminating port at Node C.

   this case, a LO ODUj is set up via an OTUk/OCh (k = j) connection 
   between Node A and Node B and via one or more tributary slots in an 
   existing HO ODUk (/OTUk/OCh)(k > j) connection between Node B and 
   Node C. The OTUk/OCh connection between Node A and Node B must be set 
   up as part of the LO ODUj connection set up. A LO ODUj link 
   connection must be instantiated within the HO ODUk between Node B and 
   Node C.  

   A LO ODU2 can be generated at Node A, switched to one of the 10G line 
   ports and mapped into an OTU2/OCh at Node A, demapped from the OTU2 
   at Node B, switched at Node B to one of the 40G line ports and

   Node C and switched to its LO ODU2 terminating port at Node C.

   Prior to any LO ODUj connection request, network planning/engineering 
   will generate connection requests (a) in figure 3 for the creation of 
   HO ODUk/OTUk/OCh connections. Afterwards a LO ODUj connection request

   ODUk connections. 

   Prior to any LO ODUj connection request, network planning/engineering 
   will generate connection request (a) in figure 4 for the creation of 
   the HO ODUk/OTUk/OCh connection. Afterwards a LO ODUj connection 
   request (b) will make use of the LO ODU link bandwidth provided by 
   this HO ODUk connection. In addition, the LO ODUj connection request 
   (b) generates an OTUk/OCh connection request (c) to cross the OCh 
   subnetwork between nodes A and B. 

   So Connection Management should consider how to manage these 
   different LO ODU, HO ODU, OTU and OCh connections within the OTN. As 
   agreed in Q.12/15 each ODU layer (LO ODU, HO ODU) will have 
   visibility into the OCh layer to enable ODU connection set up through 
   a mix of subwavelength and wavelength links and matrices. 

   For the connection indicated by (b) in Figure 2-4, this LO ODUk is a 
   client of the connections indicated by (a) and (c). There are many 
   Levels at different rates for LO ODUk (e.g., ODUflex, ODU0, ODU1, 
   ODU2, ODU3, etc.). Each LO ODUk may share the same server Higher ODUk. 
   For example, in Figure 5, LO ODU1 and LO ODU2 share the same server 
   Higher ODU3. From the viewpoint of layer connection, a simpler 
   representation is to describe the LO ODU as a single layer network, 
   in which the bit rate of a client is a parameter.  This 
   representation shows a single topology containing (OTUk/OCh/OMSn/OTSn, 
   OTUk/OChr/OPSn and HO ODUk/OTUk/OCh supported) LO ODU links and 
   subnetworks (i.e. resources) that is shared by all client ODU signals.

   The path computation for LO ODU is to select a suitable route through 
   the network using available LO wavelength and sub-wavelength ODU 
   links and matrices, allocate on sub-wavelength LO ODU links one or 
   more tributary slots of the Higher Order OPU to the LO ODU link 
   connection and allocate on wavelength LO ODU links one wavelength to 
   the LO ODU link connection.  

   The path computation for HO ODU is to select a suitable route through 
   the network using available HO wavelength and sub-wavelength ODU 
   links and matrices, allocate on sub-wavelength HO ODU links one or 
   more tributary slots to the HO ODU link connection and allocate on 
   wavelength HO ODU links one wavelength to the HO ODU link connection.  

   OTM-0.m and OTM-0.mvn connections support a single OTUk and a single 
   ODUk link connection. LO ODU or HO ODU path computation can select 
   such OTM-0 support LO ODU or HO ODU link, in which case the full 
   capacity is allocated to the LO or HO ODU link connection. 

    

   Take the following Figure 6 as an example, the single topology 
   containing links and matrices can be illustrated as follows: 

   LO ODU Link #1: HO ODU2, support transport of ODU0, ODU1, ODU2; 

   LO ODU Link #2: HO ODU3, support transport of ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU3; 

   LO ODU Link #3: HO ODU2, support transport of ODU0, ODU1, ODU2; 

   LO ODU Link #4: HO ODU1, support transport of ODU0; 

   LO ODU Link #5: HO ODU1, support transport of ODU0; 

   LO ODU Matrix A 

   LO ODU Matrix B 

   LO ODU Matrix C 

   LO ODU Matrix D 

   LO ODU Matrix E 

   If the LO ODUk (k = 0) connection from A to D is requested, two paths 
   may be feasible. One alternative is A-> Link #1 -> B -> Link #2 -> C 
   -> Link #3 -> D. Along this path, LO ODU0 is multiplexed into HO ODU2, 
   and then transported along Link #1 to Node B where it is

   then multiplexed onto Link #2 to go to Node C. At Node C the LO ODU0 
   is demultiplexed, switched through LO ODU Matrix C and then 
   multiplexed onto Link #3 to go to Node D. At Node D the LO ODU0 is 
   demultiplexed from the HO ODU, switched through LO ODU Matrix D and 
   then terminated.

5. GMPLS/PCE Implications 

5.1. Implications for LSP Hierarchy with GMPLS TE 

   The path computation for LO ODU connection request is based on the 
   topology of ODU layer, including OCh layer visibility.  

   The OTN path computation can be divided into two layers as described 
   in section 4. One layer is OCh/OTUk/ODUk, the other is LO ODU. 
   [RFC4206] defines the mechanisms to accomplish creating the hierarchy 
   of LSPs. The LSP management of multiple layers in OTN can follow the 
   procedures defined in [RFC4206] and related MLN drafts. 

   As discussed in section 4, the route path computation for OCh is in 
   the scope of WSON [WSON-Frame]. Therefore, this document only 
   considers ODU layer for LO ODU connection request since the OCh layer 
   is being discussed in WSON scope [WSON-Frame]. 

5.2. Implications for GMPLS Signaling 

   The signaling function and Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic 
   Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions are described in [RFC3471] and [RFC 
   3473]. For OTN-specific control, [RFC4328] defines signaling 
   extensions to support G.709 Optical Transport Networks Control.  
 
 
zhang                    Expires April 2010                   [Page 19] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-g709-framework-00.txt              October 2009 
    

   However, with the evolution of OTN, there are some new features 
   introduced in ITU-T, for example, ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 and ODUflex. 

   Therefore, it is obvious that [RFC4328] can not support these new 
   features of OTN from control plane perspective, and it should be 
   updated or replaced to support the evolution of OTN. 

5.2.1. Identifying OTN signals 

   [RFC4328] defines the LSP Encoding Type, the Switching Type and the 
   Generalized Protocol Identifier (Generalized-PID) constituting the 
   common part of the Generalized Label Request. And the G.709 Traffic 
   Parameters are also defined in [RFC4328]. But some new features for 
   the evolving OTN has been introduced since [RFC4328] released. This 
   new features are summarized as follows: 

   (1) New signal types of digital wrapper layer 

      a) Optical Channel Transport Unit (OTUk)  
         -  OTU4 
         -  OTU2e 
         -  OTU3e1 
         -  OTU3e2 

      b) Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUk): 
         -  ODU0 
         -  ODU2e 
         -  ODU3e1 
         -  ODU3e2      
         -  ODU4 
         -  ODUflex 

   (2) A new Tributary Slot (TS) granularity (i.e., 1.25 Gbps) 

   (3) Signal type with variable bandwidth: 


 
 
zhang                    Expires April 2010                   [Page 20] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-g709-framework-00.txt              October 2009 
    

       ODUflex has a variable bandwidth/bit rate BR and a bit rate 
       tolerance T. Different bandwidth may need different numbers of 
       tributary slots allocation when this kind of connection setup. 
       Therefore, bit rate and bit rate tolerance should be carried in 
       the Traffic Parameter in the signaling of connection setup request. 

   (4) New multiplexing hierarchy (For example, ODU0 into ODU1 
       multiplexing (with 1,25Gbps TS granularity).) 

   So [RFC4328] needs to be updated to support all the signal types and 
   related mapping and multiplexing with all kinds of tributary slots. 
   Moreover, the extensions should consider the scalability to match 
   future evolvement of OTN.  

   For item (1) and (3), new traffic parameters may need to be extended 
   in signaling message; 

   For item (2) and (4), new label should be defined to carry the exact 
   label allocation information. 

    

5.2.2. Tributary Port Number assignment 

   TBD. 

5.3. Implications for GMPLS Routing 

   As discussed in section 4.2.2, path computation element should select 
   a suitable route for LO ODU connection request and then allocate one 
   or more Higher Order OPU tributary slots. In order to compute the 
   suitable path (including tributary slots allocation) correctly, 
   routing protocol should be extended to convey some information to 
   represent ODU TE topology. 

   GMPLS Routing [RFC4202] defines Interface Switching Capability 
   Descriptor of TDM which can be used for ODU. However, some other 
   issues should also be considered which are discussed below. 

5.3.1. Requirement for conveying Interface Switching Capability specific 
   information 

   Interface Switching Capability Descriptors present a new constraint   
   for LSP path computation. [RFC4203] defines the switching capability 
   and related Maximum LSP Bandwidth and the Switching Capability 
   specific information. When the Switching Capability field is TDM the 
   Switching Capability specific information field includes Minimum LSP 
 
 
zhang                    Expires April 2010                   [Page 21] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-g709-framework-00.txt              October 2009 
    

   Bandwidth, an indication whether the interface supports Standard or 
   Arbitrary SONET/SDH, and padding. So routing protocol should be 
   extended when TDM is ODU type to support representation of ODU 
   switching information. 

   As discussed in section 3.2.2.1.3, many types of ODUj can be 
   multiplexed the same ODUk. For example, both ODU0 and ODU1 can be 
   multiplexed into ODU2. One ODU link may support one or more types of 
   ODU signals multiplexing. The routing protocol should be extended to 
   carry this multiplexing capability. 

   As discussed in section 3.2.2.1.4, one type of ODUj can be 
   multiplexed to one ODUk by different tributary slots. For example, 
   ODU1 can be multiplexed into ODU2 with either 2.5Gbps TS granularity 
   or 1.25G TS granularity. The routing protocol should be extended to 
   carry which TS granularity supported by the ODU interface.  

   Moreover, Total bandwidth of the TE link, Unreserved Bandwidth of the 
   TE link, Maximum LSP Bandwidth, Min LSP Bandwidth, etc., which are 
   Switching Capability specific information for OTN should be carried 
   by routing protocol extensions for allocation of tributary slots. 

5.4. Implications for Auto-discovery 

   As discussed in section 5.3, Path computation needs to know the 
   interface switching capability of links. The switching capability of 
   two ends of the link may be different, so the link capability of two 
   ends should be discovered.  

   [RFC4204] defines the link management protocol which is part of the 
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocol suite to manage Traffic Engineering 
   (TE) links. [RFC4204] can be a good candidate to be extended to 
   implement the auto-discovery of link capability for OTN networks. 

5.4.1. Discovering the Granularity of the TS 

   As discussed in section 3.2.2.1.1, the two ends of an ODU link may 
   support different TS structure. In that case, the LO ODU must be 
   mapped into specific combined Tributary Slots in the end of link with 
   TS of 1.25Gbps. For example, if the local end can support 1.25Gbps 
   and the remote end can support 2.5Gbps, and then the local end should 
   imitate 2.5Gbps.                 

   In order to reserve TS resources correctly for a LO ODU connection, 
   the control plane of the two ends MUST know which granularity the 
   other end can support before creating the LO ODU connection.

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-g709-framework-00.txt              October 2009 
    

   Therefore, it is necessary for the two ends of a link to discover the 
   granularity of the TS. 

5.4.2. Discovering the Supported LO ODU Signal Types 

   Many new ODU signal types are introduced by [Gsup43] and [G709-V3], 
   such as ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e, ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and ODUflex. It is possible 
   that equipment does not always support all the LO ODU signal types 
   introduced by those new standards or drafts. If one end of an HO ODU 
   link can not support a certain LO ODU signal type, the HO ODU link 
   can not be selected to carry such type of LO ODU connection. 

   Therefore, it is necessary for the two ends of an HO ODU link to 
   discover which types of LO ODU can be supported by the HO ODU link. 
   After discovering, the capability information can be flooded by IGP, 
   so that the correct path for an ODU connection can be calculated. 

5.5. Implications for PCE 

   [PCE-APS] describes the requirements for GMPLS applications of PCE in 
   order to establish GMPLS LSP. PCE needs to consider the GMPLS TE 
   attributes appropriately once a PCC or another PCE requests a path 
   computation. The TE attributes which can be contained in the path 
   calculation request message from the PCC or the PCE defined in [PCECP] 
   includes switching capability, encoding type, signal type, etc. 

   As described in section 5.2.1, new signal type and new signal with 
   variable bandwidth information need to be carried in the extended 
   signaling message of path setup. For the same consideration, PCECP 
   also has a desire to be extended to carry the new signal type and 
   related variable bandwidth information when a PCC requests a path 
   computation. 

    

6. Security Considerations 

   TBD. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   TBD.

Intellectual Property 
 
   The IETF Trust takes no position regarding the validity or scope of   
   any Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be   
   claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology   
   described in any IETF Document or the extent to which any license   
   under such rights might or might not be available; nor does it   
   represent that it has made any independent effort to identify any   
   such rights. 

   Copies of Intellectual Property disclosures made to the IETF   
   Secretariat and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or   
   the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or   
   permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or   
   users of this specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR   
   repository at http://www.ietf.org/ipr 

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any   
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary   
   rights that may cover technology that may be required to implement   
   any standard or specification contained in an IETF Document. Please   
   address the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org. 

   The definitive version of an IETF Document is that published by, or   
   under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of IETF Documents that are   
   published by third parties, including those that are translated into   
   other languages, should not be considered to be definitive versions   
   of IETF Documents. The definitive version of these Legal Provisions   
   is that published by, or under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of   
   these Legal Provisions that are published by third parties, including   
   those that are translated into other languages, should not be   
   considered to be definitive versions of these Legal Provisions. 

   For the avoidance of doubt, each Contributor to the IETF Standards   
   Process licenses each Contribution that he or she makes as part of   
   the IETF Standards Process to the IETF Trust pursuant to the   
   provisions of RFC 5378. No language to the contrary, or terms,   
   conditions or rights that differ from or are inconsistent with the   
   rights and licenses granted under RFC 5378, shall have any effect and   
   shall be null and void, whether published or posted by such   
   Contributor, or included with or in such Contribution.
