Abstract

   The URLFETCH command defined as part of URLAUTH provides a mechanism
   for third-parties to gain access to data held within messages in a
   user's private store, however, this data is sent verbatim, which is
   not suitable for a number of applications.  This memo specifies a
   method for obtaining data in forms suitable for non-mail
   applications.

Internet-Draft               URLFETCH BINARY               November 2007


1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

   Protocol examples are line-wrapped for clarity.  Protocol strings are
   prefixed with C: and S: for client and server respectively, and
   elided data is represented by [...].  Implementors should note these
   notations are for editorial clarity only.


2.  Introduction

   Although [URLAUTH] provides a URLFETCH command which can be used to
   dereference a URL and return the body part data, it does so by
   returning the encoded form, without sufficient data to decode.  This
   is suitable for use in mail applications such as [BURL], where the
   encoded form is suitable, but not where access to the actual content
   is required, such as [STREAMING].

   This memo specifies a mechanism which returns additional metadata
   about the part, such as its media type, as well as removing any
   content transfer encoding used on the body part.


3.  Extended URLFETCH

   This extension is available in any IMAP server implementation which
   includes URLAUTH=BINARY within its capability string.

   Such servers accept additional, per-URL, parameters to the URLFETCH
   command, and will provide, upon request, additional data for each URL
   dereferenced.

3.1.  Command Parameters

   The URLFETCH command is extended by the provision of optional
   parameters.  The extended URLFETCH command is distinct by enclosing
   each URL and associated parameters in a parenthesized list.  The
   absence of any parameters, or if the URL is sent unenclosed, causes
   the command to behave precisely as specified in [URLAUTH].

   Available parameters are:

Internet-Draft               URLFETCH BINARY               November 2007


   BODYPARTSTRUCTURE
      Provides a BODYPARTSTRUCTURE in additional to the data itself.
      BODYPARTSTRUCTURE is defined in [CONVERT].

   BINARY
      Remove any Content-Transfer-Encoding.  In particular, this means
      that the data MAY contain NUL octets, and not be formed from
      textual lines.  Data containing NUL octets MUST be transferred
      using the literal8 syntax defined in [BINARY].


3.2.  Response Metadata

   In order to carry any requested metadata and provide additional
   information to the consumer, the URLFETCH response is similarly
   extended.

   Following the URL itself, servers will include a series of
   parenthesized metadata elements.  Defined metadata elements are as
   follows:
   BODYPARTSTRUCTURE
      The BODYPARTSTRUCTURE provides information about the data
      contained in the response, as it has been returned.  It will
      reflect any conversions or decoding that have taken place.


   Note that unlike [CONVERT], BODYPARTSTRUCTURE is not appended with
   the part specifier, as this is implicit in the URL.

4.  Formal Syntax

   This formal syntax uses ABNF as specified in [ABNF], and includes
   productions defined in [URLAUTH] and [IMAP].

   capability       =/ "URLAUTH=BINARY"

      ; Command parameters; see Section 3.1

   urlfetch         =  "URLFETCH" 1*(SP url-fetch-arg)

   url-fetch-arg    =  url-fetch-simple / url-fetch-ext

   url-fetch-simple =  url-full
      ; Unextended URLFETCH.

   url-fetch-ext    =  "(" url-full *(SP url-fetch-param) ")"
      ; If no url-fetch-param present, as unextended.

   url-fetch-param  =  "BINARY" / "BODYPARTSTRUCTURE" / atom
      ; TODO: Should this be iana-token?

      ; Response; see Section 3.2

   urlfetch-data    =  "*" SP "URLFETCH" 1*(SP url-full [url-metadata]
                       SP (nstring / literal8))
      ; MUST use nstring and MUST NOT use SP url-metadata when client
      ; issues url-fetch-simple or no url-fetch-param.

   url-metadata     =  1*(SP "(" url-metadata-el ")")

   url-metadata-el  =  "BODYPARTSTRUCTURE" SP body
