Abstract

   At the IETF 77 Clouds Bar BoF, it was suggested that an internet
   draft on survey of standard organizations and working groups that are
   focusing on cloud-based systems and services be prepared.  The
   objective is to take a snapshot of industry activities related to
   cloud features and functions for the purpose of creating a gap
   analysis.  This document is that survey on industry work items.  At
   the end of this survey a section on work item analysis is presented.

Internet-Draft   Cloud Industry Workitem Survey Results    December 2010


1.  Introduction

   This draft presents a survey of the industry work item related to
   cloud activities.  By conducting a comprehensive survey, work items
   in Cloud standards can be determined.  This will allow us to
   determine the IETF work that would be required to address the work
   items.  Once these IETF work have been completed, seamless
   interoperability of cloud services can be realized.

2.  Terminology

   Cloud-based systems are conveniently-connected modular blocks of
   resources

   o  Both physical and virtual modularizations of resources are
      possible

   o  For this discussion, the resources include computing (CPU),
      communications (bandwidth), memory (storage), management,
      database, software, applications, services, interconnectivity,
      etc.

   o  The objective is to make the resources available ubiquitously for
      mission-specific applications and services in order to support the
      ultimate level of privacy/security, scalability and reliability
      cost-effectively and without the headache of owning and
      maintaining the infrastructure

   Service over Cloud

   o  Utilize (stitch, weave, embroider, ...) the resources from Cloud
      to provision, create, deliver, and maintain an End-to-End Service

   o  Use the service only when you Need it

   o  Pay only for the time duration and type of use of service (incl.
      the costs for resources used)

3.  Work Items Explanation

   WorkItem A: Cloud Client-side API (if proprietary why?  If open
   protocol, how it is modified/adapted)

   o  Cloud Client-side API is the interface provided to users and
      third-party developers to access resources of the Cloud Computing
      Platforms.  In this work item, we need to find out whether the API
      is proprietary, or open, and how it is modified/adapted.

   WorkItem B: Cloud Server-side API (if proprietary why?  If open
   protocol, how it is modified/adapted)

   o  Cloud Server-side API is the interface provided to applications/
      services running on the Cloud Computing Platforms to access the
      capabilities of the Platforms.  In this work item, we need to find
      out whether the API is proprietary, or open, and how it is
      modified/adapted.

   WorkItem C: Clouds OS layer (what are added to the VM layer to hide
   the complexity)

   o  Clouds OS layer refers to an Operating System or Hypervisor and
      Virtual Machines (VM) that resides above the physical resource
      layer to manage the physical resource.  We need to investigate
      what are added to the VM layer to hide the complexity of the Cloud
      system.

   WorkItem D: Cloud Service and Resources Logging, Auditing, and
   Reporting

   o  Cloud Logging, Auditing, and Reporting are used to trace Cloud
      Service and Resources activities and status.  Cloud logging means
      that an open and extensible log format to be used by any cloud
      entity or cloud application to log and trace users or system
      activities that occur in the cloud.  Auditing and Reporting means
      that specific information can be got from the Cloud system for
      diagnosis fault or analysis system behavior.

   WorkItem E: Cloud Service Performance and Security Monitoring and
   Reporting

   o  Cloud Performance and Security Monitoring and Reporting are used
      to trace Cloud service performance and security behavior.  Cloud
      Service Performance means the ability to deliver guaranteed
      Quality of Services (QoS) services on Cloud.  Cloud Security
      Monitoring and Reporting provide interactive displays and
      automated reports of all security-related components, including

      real-time monitoring of services/applications user accounts,
      files, access, intrusions, etc.

   WorkItem F: Cloud Resources Definition and Description

   o  Cloud Resources Definition and Description is the mechanism that
      can be used as a general method for conceptual description or
      modeling of information that is implemented in cloud abstracted
      resources, using a variety of syntax formats.

   WorkItem G: Cloud Resources and VM Mobility across Private-Private,
   Private-Public, etc.  Clouds

   o  This workitem is to investigate whether the industry focus on
      Cloud Resources and VM Mobility.  If so, what kind of technology
      is used.

   WorkItem H: Multi-Domain Distributed Scaling and Filing of
   Information / Resources

   o  This workitem is to investigate whether the industry services are
      distributed among multi-domain and scale on demand, and the
      information and resources (such as billing, logging record) are
      filed among multi-domain in the Cloud.

   WorkItem I: Provisioning of advanced services (XaaS, voice, video,
   streaming media, gaming, etc.) over a variety of Clouds

   o  This workitem is to investigate whether the industry advanced
      services can be deployed on other Clouds.

   WorkItem J: Support and maintenance of advanced services over a
   variety of Clouds

   o  This workitem is to investigate whether the Cloud can provide
      support and maintenance to other cloud industry advanced services.

   WorkItem K: Address resolution and extension (e.g, VPN extension to
   private Clouds)

   o  ARP extension provides a scalable Address Resolution protocol to
      map virtual host's identity to physical IP/MAC addresses to solve
      client routing among multiple subnetworks.

   WorkItem L: Risk, Resiliency, and SLA (RRS): Risk-tolerance, MMTF,
   MMTR, etc. for Components and Apps/Services (End-to-End)

4.15.  Mosso/Rackspace

   http://www.mosso.com/. http://www.rackspacecloud.com/.

   Mosso is owned by Rackspace, The Cloud Portal is running on Mosso.

   The Rackspace Cloud was originally launched as Mosso LLC on March 4,
   2006, a wholly owned subsidiary startup billed as a utility computing
   offering.  As it pre-dated mainstream adoption of cloud computing it
   was "retooled" and relaunched on February 19, 2008, adopting the
   tagline "Mosso: The Hosting Cloud".  The "Mosso" branding (including
   the mosso.com domain) was then dropped on June 17, 2009 in favour of
   "The Rackspace Cloud" branding (including the rackspacecloud.com
   domain).  Since then, customer contracts have been executed with
   Rackspace US, Inc. d/b/a The Rackspace Cloud rather than with the
   Mosso LLC subsidiary.

4.18.  Sun Caroline

   https://www.projectcaroline.net/main/.
   http://labs.oracle.com/projects/caroline/.

   An advanced R&D project at Sun Microsystems, Project Caroline is a
   hosting platform for development and delivery of dynamically scalable
   Internet-based services.  It is designed to serve an emerging market
   of small and medium sized software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers.
   Anticipating needs driven by new SaaS business models and processes,
   Project Caroline helps SaaS providers develop services rapidly using
   high-level programming languages like the Java(tm) programming
   language, Ruby, Python, and Perl, to update in-production services
   frequently, and to automatically flex their use of platform resources
   to match changing runtime demands.

   http://www.adobe.com/products/air/

   The Adobe AIR 2 runtime enables developers to use HTML, JavaScript,
   Adobe Flash software, and ActionScript to build web applications that
   run as standalone client applications without the constraints of a
   browser.  Adobe AIR and the Adobe Flash Platform unleash the
   creativity of designers and developers by providing a consistent and
   flexible development environment for the delivery of applications
   across devices and platforms.  Support for additional platforms,
   including Android, is under development.

   Google Apps are reliable, secure web-based office tools for any size
   business.  They are powerful, and intuitive applications like Gmail,
   Google Calendar and Google Docs can help reduce your IT costs and
   help employees collaborate more effectively.

   The Apps Engine allows developers to write applications to run on
   Google's servers while accessing data that resides in the Google
   cloud as well as data that resides behind the corporate firewall.

   http://aws.amazon.com/s3/

   Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet.  It is designed to make web-
   scale computing easier for developers.

   Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used
   to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere
   on the web.  It gives any developer access to the same highly
   scalable, reliable, secure, fast, inexpensive infrastructure that
   Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.  The service
   aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to
   developers.

4.32.  Apache CouchDB

   http://couchdb.apache.org/

   Apache CouchDB is a document-oriented database that can be queried
   and indexed in a MapReduce fashion using JavaScript.  CouchDB also
   offers incremental replication with bi-directional conflict detection
   and resolution.

   CouchDB provides a RESTful JSON API than can be accessed from any
   environment that allows HTTP requests.  There are myriad third-party
   client libraries that make this even easier from your programming
   language of choice.  CouchDB!_s built in Web administration console
   speaks directly to the database using HTTP requests issued from your
   browser.

4.34.  LongJump

   http://www.longjump.com/

   LongJump began with the following belief: Precious development
   resources are better utilized creating innovative solutions for the
   web, rather than reinventing common technologies.  This allows ideas
   to become reality faster and provides a common development
   methodology that scales and adapts to changing market conditions.

5.  Summary and Analysis

   In summary, this survey of Cloud Industries shows that there are a
   variety of ways to support both client-side and server-side
   application layer programming interfaces (APIs) to support cloud
   services.  Many of these services tend to utilize resources across
   multiple administrative, technology, and geographically distributed
   domains.  There is no unified and universally acceptable protocol and
   mechanism to define the mobility of resources across domains.  The
   early implementers tend to utilize the features and functions of the
   existing protocols along with their proprietary modifications or
   extensions in order to achieve their goals.  In addition to using a
   virtualization layer (VM layer), a thin Cloud operating system (OS)
   layer may be useful to hide the complexity, specificity, and
   regionality (locality) of the resources.  We also observe that
   different industries are trying to develop many different methods for
   logging and reporting of resource usage for Cloud services.  This
   will create auditing transparency problems which may negatively
   impact the development of security and service level agreement
   features.  At the end, these may in fact result in an increase in the
   effective cost for services that utilize the cloud based systems and
   networks, violating the very foundation on which the concept of using
   cloud is based on.

7.  Conclusion

   We have presented a survey of Cloud Industries along with a simple
   early analysis.  This survey has revealed that different Industries
   are utilizing a set of proprietary solutions/interfaces for cloud
   services, or some time they modify or extend open solutions/
   interfaces in order to satisfy their niche objectives.  These will
   not only cause interoperability problems, but may also negatively
   impact further development of protocols and services in this very
   important area of cloud computing and networking.  IETF is the best
   organization to address these issues.

   o  Based on the statistics data, most of the solutions on the Work
      Items D, E, K are proprietary, fundamental functions for the
      Cloud, so they are of the first higher priority.

   o  The Work Items A, B, C, F have open solutions, it!_s better to
      investigate whether they are suitable for IETF framework and which
      is the best, so they are of the second higher priority.

   o  The Work Items G, H are interoperability related , I, J are
      service related, and L, M are capability related, so they are of
      the lower priority.
