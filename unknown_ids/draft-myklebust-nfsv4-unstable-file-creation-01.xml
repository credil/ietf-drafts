			This document describes an extension to the
			NFSv4 protocol to allow clients to create and
			write files with greater efficiency.
		</t>
		<t>
			The proposed extension allows the server to defer
			creating the file on stable storage when replying
			to an OPEN call. The aim is to improve server
			efficiency and scalability by reducing the number
			of required disk accesses when writing a file from
			scratch.

	<section title="Introduction">
		<t>
			One of the remaining sources of performance and
			scalability issues in the NFSv4.1 protocol
			<xref target="RFC5661" />,
			for workloads that require the
			creation of large numbers of files, is that file
			creation is still required to be synchronous.
			This limitation means that the minimum number
			of disk accesses in a workload that involves
			creating a file, writing to it and then closing it
			is 2: one at OPEN time, and one at COMMIT.
			The following proposal allows the client to indicate
			to the server, by means of a new attribute, that
			it is prepared to take on the burden of re-creating
			the file from scratch if the server should reboot
			before the file has been fully written.
			The same attribute also allows the client to check
			on the state of the file on the server, and thus
			perhaps to optimise away unnecessary COMMIT requests.

			The attribute 'stable_state' is an optional
			per-file attribute that can be used by the
			client to determine whether or not the server
			believes that all metadata and data has
			been committed to persistent storage. It is
			expected that clients may wish to poll it as
			part of a post-op attribute request or an
			attribute refresh.

			<list style="symbols">
				<t>
					If the server returns a zero value, then the
					client may assume that all metadata and data
					changes that were made since the server last
					rebooted have been committed to persistent
					storage.
				</t>
				<t>
					If the server sets the bits NFS4_UNSTABLE_METADATA
					and/or NFS4_UNSTABLE_DATA, then this means that
					there may be respectively metadata, or data that
					has not been synced to disk. The client should
					be prepared to send a COMMIT request in order to
					ensure persistence of metadata and data.
				</t>
				<t>
					If the server sets the bit NFS4_UNSTABLE_PNFS,
					then this indicates that there are outstanding
					layouts for write, and thus the state of the
					file may not be fully known to the server.
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		<t>
			A naive server may choose to implement 'stable_state'
			in terms of a simple flag: it sets NFS4_UNSTABLE_DATA
			when it receives an unstable WRITE request, sets
			NFS4_UNSTABLE_METADATA when it receives an unstable
			OPEN or SETATTR requests and clears both flags
			when it receives a COMMIT. While such an
			implementation may not be as useful for avoiding
			unnecessary COMMIT operations, it is sufficient
			to support unstable OPEN and SETATTR.
		</t>
		<section title="Use of the 'stable_state' attribute for unstable OPEN requests">
			<t>
				We propose a new mode of file creation named
				"unstable file creation". By choosing this
				mode of creation, the client is notifying the
				server that it may defer syncing to disk the
				new file's directory entry as well as the new
				file metadata. In case of a server reboot, the
				client is then responsible for replaying the
				file creation if the reboot occurred before
				the file metadata was committed to disk.
			</t>
			<section title="Client use of the 'stable_state' attribute">
				<t>
					In order to indicate that the client wishes
					to have the server use unstable file creation,
					it must set the NFS4_UNSTABLE_METADATA bit in
					the optional attribute 'stable_state'. Upon
					return of the OPEN call, the client then
					checks that 'stable_state' was indeed set by
					inspecting the 'attrset' bitmap in the usual
					way. It can assume that if the 'stable_state'
					was not set, then the file has been created
					in persistent storage.
				</t>
				<t>
					The client MUST NOT set the 'stable_state'
					to any value other than NFS4_UNSTABLE_METADATA.
					The server SHOULD return NFS4ERR_INVAL if it
					receives an invalid value.
				</t>
				<t>
					Once the client is done making changes to the
					file, it may use a COMMIT to force the server
					to flush all data and metadata changes to
					persistent storage.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Server response upon receiving an unstable OPEN request">
				<t>
					Upon receiving an OPEN request that
					includes a 'stable_state' attribute,
					the server MAY choose to ignore it,
					and simply apply the usual NFSv4 rule
					that all metadata must be committed
					to persistent storage. If so, it
					simply omits the 'stable_state' bit
					from the returned attribute bitmap.
				</t>
				<t>
					The server MUST NOT set the
					'stable_state' flag if the file already
					exists.
				</t>
				<t>
					If the server does choose to honour
					the 'stable_state' attribute, then it
					MUST also return a write delegation to
					the client. This write delegation is
					needed in order to allow the client
					to detect the recovery edge condition
					in which a second client attempts
					to rename the file or delete it just
					prior to a server reboot.
				</t>
				<t>
					Once the file has been created in the
					server cache memory, the server is
					then free to process the remaining
					elements of the COMPOUND without
					syncing the new file metadata to
					disk.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Delegation return and unstable OPEN">
				<t>
					If the client returns the write delegation,
					then it MUST ensure that the file metadata is
					in a stable state. It does so by
					sending a COMMIT operation, unless polling
					has already established that the
					'stable_state' attribute no longer
					sets the NFS4_UNSTABLE_METADATA bit.

				<t>
					A server that supports unstable file
					creation SHOULD reject all CREATE and
					ordinary file creation attempts during
					the grace period using the error
					NFS4ERR_GRACE in order to allow
					clients to recover any unstable files
					that may have been lost.
				</t>
				<t>
					In order to recover the file,
					the client MUST replay the original
					OPEN that was used to create the file,
					using an open claim type of
					CLAIM_PREVIOUS_UNSTABLE.
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>
							If the server is no longer
							in the recovery grace
							period, then it MUST return
							NFS4ERR_NO_GRACE.
						</t>
						<t>
							If the server discovers
							that the file already
							exists, it treats the
							OPEN as if it were a
							CLAIM_PREVIOUS request
							for a write delegation.
						</t>
						<t>
							If the file does not
							exist, then the server
							creates the file in
							the usual fashion
							and returns a valid
							write delegation.
						</t>	
					</list>
				</t>
				<t>
					Recovery from a NFS4ERR_NO_GRACE error will,
					as usual, depend on the client's operating
					environment. However, client implementors should
					note the existence of the following race
					condition:
					<list style="numbers">
						<t>
							Client 1 creates an unstable
							file, and receives a filehandle
							which it caches.
						</t>
						<t>
							The server reboots before it has
							committed the file to disk. The
							filehandle information, in particular,
							is lost.
						</t>
						<t>
							A network partition prevents client 1
							from recovering the file.
						</t>
						<t>
							After the grace period expires, client 2
							creates a file, and the server assigns it
							the same filehandle as was previously
							assigned to the unstable file created
							by client 1.
						</t>
						<t>
							After the network partition is done,
							client 1 attempts to recover the unstable
							file, but receives NFS4ERR_NO_GRACE.
							At this point, client 1 may attempt to access
							the file via the filehandle, but this now
							points to the new file created by client 2. 
						</t>
					</list>
					If the server supports the 'time_create', 'time_metadata' or
					'time_modify' recommended attributes, then client 1 may
					use that information to disambiguate the situation above.
					Should that information not be available, however, the
					client may have to fall back to attempting an exclusive
					create for the same file, and returning an error to the
					application should this fail.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Directory cache consistency and unstable files">
				<t>
					While the client that created the file
					can easily recover in case of a server
					reboot, it is not necessarily so easy
					for other clients to do so. While the
					write delegation does indeed ensure
					that those clients do not hold the
					file open (neither do they hold any
					cached data), it does not guarantee
					that they are not caching LOOKUP or
					READDIR data.
				</t>
				<t>
					In order to avoid issues with directory
					cache consistency across server reboots, it is
					therefore RECOMMENDED that servers
					ensure that initial file metadata be
					committed to persistent storage prior
					to replying to a another client's
					LOOKUP of the new file, or READDIR
					of the directory in which the new file
					was created. This will also prevent
					those clients from seeing
					filehandles and fileids that might
					change upon server reboot.
				</t>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section title="Use of the 'stable_state' attribute in unstable SETATTR requests">
			<t>
				If it holds a write delegation, the client may
				also use the 'stable_state' attribute in a
				SETATTR request to indicate to the server that
				it is ready to replay this SETATTR in the case
				of a server reboot.
			</t>
			<t>
				The procedure is the same as for OPEN. In order
				to indicate to the server that it wants the
				SETATTR request to be unstable, the client
				sets the 'stable_state' attribute to the value
				NFS4_UNSTABLE_METADATA.
			</t>
			<t>
				Again, the server MAY ignore the 'stable_state'
				attribute, in which case it MUST immediately
				commit the attributes to stable storage, and
				MUST clear the 'stable_state' bit in the
				returned attribute bitmap.
			</t>
			<t>
				If the client does not hold a valid
				write delegation, then the server MUST also
				ignore the 'stable_state' attribute.
			</t>
			<section title="Client unstable SETATTR recovery in case of a server reboot">
				<t>
					If the server reboots before the client
					has had a chance to issue a COMMIT,
					then after recovering the write
					delegation, the client SHOULD
					check the server attributes against
					its own cached values. If there is
					a mismatch, then it is responsible
					for correcting this by replaying
					the relevant SETATTR calls.
				</t>

			<section title="Delegation return and unstable SETATTR">
