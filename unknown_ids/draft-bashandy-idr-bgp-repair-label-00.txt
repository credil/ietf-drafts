Abstract

Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the provider edge BGP
speaker PE1, PE2,..., PEn know about a prefix P/p via the external
routers CE1, CE2,..., CEm.  If the PE router PEi loses connectivity to
the primary path, whether it is another PE router or a CE router, it
desirable to immediately restore traffic by rerouting packets arriving
to PEi and destined to the prefix P/p to one of the other PE routers
that advertised P/p, say PEj, until BGP re-converges. However if the
loss of connectivity of PEi to the primary path also resulted in the
loss of connectivity between PEj and CEj, rerouting a packet without
before the control plane converges may result in a loop. In this
document, we propose using a repair label for traffic restoration
while avoiding loops. We propose advertising the ''repair'' label
through BGP.

1. Introduction

   In a BGP free core, where traffic is tunneled between edge routers
   and edge routers assign labels to prefixes, BGP speakers advertise
   reachability information about prefixes and associate a local label
   with each prefix such as L3VPN [9], 6PE [10], and Softwire [8].
   Suppose that a given edge router is chosen as the best next-hop for
   a prefix P/p. An ingress router that receives a packet from an
   external router and destined for the prefix P/p pushes the label
   advertised by the egress edge router and then ''tunnels'' the packet
   across the core to that egress router. Upon receiving the labeled
   packet from the core, the egress router uses the label on the
   packet to take the appropriate forwarding decision.

   In modern networks, it is not uncommon to have a prefix reachable
   via multiple edge routers. One example is the best external path
   [7] Another more common and widely deployed scenario is L3VPN [9]
   with multi-homed VPN sites. As an example, consider the L3VPN
   topology depicted in Figure 1.

             Figure 1 VPN prefix reachable via multiple PEs

   PE3 is the ingress PE. PE1 and PE2 are both egress PEs connected to
   CE. CE advertises one or more VPN prefixes, denoted by P/p. PE1 and
   PE2 advertise P/p as VPNv4 or VPNv6 routes to all ingress PEs,
   including PE3, and associates a label with each route.

   Suppose that the ingress PE, PE3, chooses PE1 as the next-hop for
   the prefix P/p. In order to minimize traffic loss, it is highly
   desirable for PE1 to reroute all traffic destined to P/p to PE2 as
   soon as the connectivity to CE is lost and without waiting for the
   control plane (whether it is IGP or BGP) to re-converge and
   computes new the best path. In doing so, PE1 pushes the label
   advertised by PE2 for the prefix P/p, and then ''tunnels'' the packet
   to PE2. However if the loss of PE1-CE connectivity was due to CE
   crash, then PE2 will also reroute the traffic back to PE1,
   resulting in loop. Due to ultra scalability requirements, where
   there is a need to support thousands of peers and hundreds of
   thousands of prefixes, there is a need to support quick traffic
   restoration without waiting for the control plane to converge and
   without risking loops.

   1.1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   1.2. Terminology

   This section outlines the terms used in this document. For ease of
   use, we will use terms similar to those used by L3VPN [9]

   o  Protected prefix: It is a prefix P/p (of any AFI) that a BGP
      speaker has an external path to. The BGP speaker may learn about
      the prefix from an external peer through BGP, some other
      protocol, or manual configuration. The protected prefix is
      advertised to some or all the internal peers.

   o  Primary egress PE: It is an IBGP peer that can reach the
      protected prefix P/p through an external path and advertised the
      prefix to the other IBGP peers. The primary egress PE was chosen
      as the best path by one or more internal peers. In other words,
      the primary egress PE is an egress PE that will normally be used
      when there is no failure. Referring to Figure 1, PE1 is a
      primary egress PE.

   o  CE: It is an external router through which an egress PE can
      reach a prefix P/p. The router ''CE'' in Figure 1 is an example of
      such CE

   o  Ingress PE: It is a BGP speaker that learns about a prefix
      through another IBGP peer and chooses that IBGP peer as the
      next-hop for the prefix. PE3 in Figure 1 is an example of an
      ingress PE

   o  Repairing PE: It is the PE that attempts to restore traffic when
      the primary path is no longer reachable ''without'' waiting for
      BGP to re-converge. The repairing PE restores the traffic by
      rerouting the traffic (through a tunnel) towards the pre-
      calculated repair PE when it detects that the primary path
      longer reachable. The primary path may be a CE or another egress
      PE. Referring to Figure 1, if PE3 chooses PE1 as the primary
      egress PE and PE1 decides to reroute traffic to PE2 on losing
      reachability with CE, then PE1 is a repairing PE. If PE3 chooses
      PE1 as a primary path and PE3 decides to use PE2 as a repair
      path when it loses reachability to PE2, then PE3 is a repairing
      PE.

   o  Primary label: It is the label advertised by the primary egress
      PE to be used for normal traffic forwarding.

Internet-Draft        BGP FRR using Repair Label          February 2011

   o  Repair egress PE: It is an egress PE other than the primary
      egress PE that can reach the protected prefix P/p through an
      external neighbor. The repair PE is pre-calculated via other PEs
      prior to any failure

   o  Repair label: It is the label that will be pushed on the packet
      when the repairing PE reroutes the traffic (through a tunnel)
      towards the repair egress PE. Section 2. discusses how the
      repair label is used. Section 3. discusses semantics of and
      methods for disseminating repair label information.

   o  Repair path: It is the repair egress PE and the repair label.

2. Protocol Operation

   This section explains the operation of the control and forwarding
   planes of routers participating BGP-free core traffic restoration.

   2.1. Control plane Operation

   1. As usual, each PE allocates a local label for each prefix it can
      reach through an external neighbor CE. This is the primary label
      used for normal traffic forwarding.

   2. To provide repair path information to all PEs, the PE also
      allocates a repair label to the prefix if it can reach that
      prefix via an external neighbor. Different repair label
      allocation schemes are proposed in Section 3.

   3. If repair label advertisement is used (Sections 3.1. ), the PE
      advertises both the primary and repair labels to all IBGP peers.

   4. When a PE receives the label advertisement from egress PEs, it
      calculates a primary egress PE and a repair egress PE based on
      its internal path selection criteria. Note that the method of
      choosing the repair path is beyond the scope of this document.

   5. In the end, for some of the prefix advertised by more than one
      PE, an egress PE will have

       o a primary path

       o a repair path consisting of a repair PE and a repair label
          advertised by or agreed upon with the chosen repair PE.

   6. A PE "never" protects a repair label. Hence on any PE, a repair
      label only has paths towards the CE. However a primary label may
      have a repair path towards a chosen repair PE

Internet-Draft        BGP FRR using Repair Label          February 2011

2.1.1. Additional Rules for allocating and advertising a Repair label

   o  A repairing PE MUST NOT advertise a repair for a prefix if it does
      NOT have an external path to the prefix

   o  A repairing PE MUST NOT associate an internal path with a repair
      label

   o  Repair labels SHOULD be advertised with labeled address families
      only. That is AFI/SAFI 1/4, 2/4, 1/128, and 2/128.



   2.2. Forwarding Plane Operation on Losing Primary path
      Reachability

   As soon as a PE loses reachability to the primary path of the
   protected prefix P/p, the forwarding plane processes arriving
   traffic as follows:

   1. If the repair label is an advertised label

       a. If the repairing PE is an egress PE, the packet arrives at
          the repairing PE with the primary label at the top because
          the packet is ''tunneled'' from the ingress PE(s). In that
          case, the repairing swaps the incoming label stack with the
          "repair label stack" advertised by the repair egress PE.
          Section 3.1.2. specifies all the details

       b. If the repairing PE is an ingress PE, it pushes the "repair
          label stack" advertised by the repair egress PE. Section
          3.1.2. specifies all the details

   2. If the repair label is an agreed upon service label

       a. If the repairing PE is an egress PE, it swaps the incoming
          label with the normal label advertised by the repair PE.
          Otherwise it pushes the primary label advertised by the
          repair PE.

       b. The repairing PE pushes the repair label on top of the label
          stack.

       c. Section Error! Reference source not found.specifies the
          details.

   3. The repairing PE tunnels the packet to the repair PE

Internet-Draft        BGP FRR using Repair Label          February 2011

   4. At the repair PE, the packet arrives with the repair label at
      the top. If the repair label is a service label, the repair PE
      pops the service label and uses the rest of the label stack.
      Otherwise the repair PE uses the incoming label stack

   5. If the repair egress PE can reach the CE, the repair PE forwards
      the packet towards the CE.

   6. If the repair CE cannot reach the CE, the traffic will be
      dropped because a PE never protects a repair label

   2.3. Example

   Consider the L3VPN [9] topology depicted in Figure 2 where two PEs
   are connected to the same PE. Assume that the core is LDP. We will
   be using an advertised repair label.

                                  PE1

                                       \
                                        \

                                      /
                                     /
                                   PE2

                        Figure 2 : L3VPN Example

   5000 -----> CE (unlabeled)

   PE2 has the following
   2000 -----> CE (unlabeled)
        -----> PE1, swap 2000 with 5000 and then push 4567
   3000 ------> CE (unlabeled)

   After the CE crashes
   ''''''''''''''''''''
   PE1 has the following entry:
   4000 -----> PE2, swap 4000 with 3000 and then push 1234
   5000 -----> Drop


   PE2 has the following
   2000 -----> PE1, swap 2000 with 5000 and then push 4567
   3000 ------> Drop


   Because of the above routing entries, any traffic arriving from the
   core at PE1 and destined for 10.0.0/8,  is rerouted towards PE2
   using the repair VPN label 3000. PE2 will just drop it instead of
   looping it back towards PE1.

   After the link between PE and CE fails (CE did not crash)
   '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
   PE1 has the following entry:
   4000 -----> PE2, swap 4000 with 3000 and then push 1234
   5000 -----> Drop

   PE2 has the following
   2000 -----> CE (unlabeled)
        -----> PE1, swap 2000 with 5000 and then push 4567
   3000 ------> CE


   Because of the above routing entries, any traffic arriving from the
   core at PE1 and destined for 10.0.0/8 is rerouted towards PE2 using
   the repair VPN label 3000. PE2 will forward the traffic towards CE.

3. How to Disseminate Repair Label Information

   To ensure maximum flexibility, we specify two approaches to
   disseminate the repair label:

   o  Advertise the repair label as an optional path attribute

   o  An agreed upon service label

Internet-Draft        BGP FRR using Repair Label          February 2011

   3.1. Advertising the repair label as an Optional Path Attribute

   Advertising the repair label as an optional path attributes has
   some advantages:

   o  An egress PE can benefits from a scalable repair label
      allocation schemes such as per-CE repair label allocation

   o  Allows the repairing PE to share the same repair path among
      multiple protected prefixes. Since the repair path is shared by
      all labels sharing the path attribute, the repairing PE can
      optimize its RIB and FIB by sharing the same repair path data
      structure among a large number of protected prefixes.

   o  Reduces the BGP update message size. Instead of having to send
      additional labels per prefix, multiple prefixes can share the
      same repair label

   o  The number of labels used for traffic restoration does not
      depend on the number of protected prefixes

   o  Allows for incremental deployment because the attribute is
      optional

   The main disadvantage of sharing the same repair path among
   multiple primary paths is loss of fine grain control. It is not
   possible to manage, control, or provide differentiated handling to
   traffic on per prefix basis until the network re-converges. The
   loss of fine grain control is limited to the BGP re-convergence
   period.

   It is noteworthy to mention that per-CE repair label allocation has
   some advantages over per-prefix repair label allocation. First it
   results in using fewer labels. Second it allows for better packing
   in BGP messages. Third it does not require special handling in the
   forwarding plane at the repair PE. Fourth it maximizes the packet
   switching performance because the egress PE can take a forwarding
   decision with a single FIB lookup.

3.1.1. Structure of the Repair Label Path Attribute

   This document defines the repair label attribute as an optional
   non-transitive path attribute [2] as follows:

      Attribute name: REPAIR_LABEL

      Type code: 129

      Attribute Flags:

         Optional bit: 1

         Transitive bit: 0

         Partial bit: 0

         Extended Length bit: 0

      Length of the attribute: It indicates the length in octets of
      the attribute

      Attribute Value: The attribute value contains a stack of one or
      more labels. The encoding of the labels is identical to encoding
      of the ''label'' field in [4]. The value of the bottom of stack
      (BOS) bit is determined at traffic restoration time as specified
      in Section 3.1.2.

3.1.2. Semantics of the Repair Label Attribute

   This document specifies the semantics of the repair label attribute
   when the attribute carries one repair label only. The semantics of
   more than one repair label is beyond the scope of this document.

   Suppose a BGP speaker PE1 receives an update message with a repair
   label attribute containing the label ''Lr2'' from the IBGP peer PE2.
   Suppose the NLRI in the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute [3] contains the
   prefixes R1, R2,. . . , Rn each bound to a label L21, L22,. . . ,
   L2n, respectively. This means the following:

   1. PE2 will never attempt to repair a packet arriving with the
      label ''Lr''. Hence PE2 will either forward the packet to an
      external CE or drop the packet

   2. PE2 expects the following from PE1:

       a. Case a: The route Ri on PE1 is bound to a local label ''L1i''
          Suppose PE1 receives a packet with the label ''L1i'' at the
          top of the stack. If the PE1 loses the primary path for a
          prefix Ri and PE1 decides that PE2 is the repair PE for the
          prefix Ri, then PE1 has to swap the label ''L1i'' on the
          packet with the repair label ''Lr2'' and then tunnel the
          packet to PE2. The bottom of stack (BOS) bit MUST be copied
          from the label arriving on the packet to the label ''Lr2''

       b. Case b: The router Ri on PE1 is not bound to any local
          label. If the PE1 loses the primary path for a prefix Ri and
          PE1 decides that PE2 is the repair PE for the prefix Ri,
          then PE1 MUST push the label ''Lr2'' and then tunnel the
          packet to PE2. The bottom of stack (BOS) bit in ''Lr2'' MUST
          be set as specified in[5].

3.1.3. Additional Rule when Forwarding Advertisements Containing the
   Repair Path Attribute

   As specified in Section 3.1.1. the repair label attribute is a non-
   transitive attribute. However there may be cases, such as inter-AS
   option (b)[9], route reflectors [11], or confederation, [12], where
   a router may replace the advertised next-hop with its own before
   forwarding an advertisement. If a BGP speaker replaces the next-hop
   attribute with its own and the advertisement contains a repair
   label attribute with label stack ''Sr'', there are two options

   o  Option 1: The BGP speaker MUST NOT advertise the repair label
      attribute

   o  Option 2: The BGP speaker MUST replace the repair label stack
      ''Sr'' with a locally allocated label stack ''Sr1'' before
      advertising the route and then advertise the stack ''Sr1'' in the
      repair label attribute. For the forwarding plane, the BGP
      speaker MUST install a swap forwarding entry such that if the
      BGP speaker receives a packet with the label stack ''Sr1'', it
      swaps ''Sr1'' with the stack ''Sr''.

   Note that advertising the repair label attribute by the router
   depends on whether the router understands the semantics of and
   supports the repair label attribute at the time of receiving an
   advertisement containing the repair label attribute.

4. Security Considerations

   No additional security risk is introduced by using the mechanisms
   proposed in this document

5. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP path attribute. IANA maintains a
   list of the current BGP attribute typecodes in [6]. This document
   proposes defining a new typecode value of ''129'' for the
   REPAIR_LABEL path attribute

6. Conclusions

   This document proposes using a repair label to allow restoring
   traffic prior to BGP convergence while avoiding loops
