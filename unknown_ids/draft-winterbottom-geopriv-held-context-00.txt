1.  Introduction

   The HELD specification [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery]
   provides a set of features that can be used by an End-Point to
   retrieve location information from an LCS.  The basic HELD
   specification does this in a more or less stateless manner.  There
   are situations however, where the End-Point wants or requires
   explicit management of data in a stateful manner on the LCS.  This
   specification describes an extension to the HELD protocol to support
   End-Point management of state information contained in a "context" on
   the LCS.

   Information contained in a context relates to a specific End-Point.
   One of the most critical pieces of functionality provided in this
   specification is the ability to void a location URI.  This is
   important, because without this functionality there is no way stop a
   third-party that has your location URI from obtaining your location.
   This condition will persist until the location URI expires.  The
   extension defined in this specification changes this behaviour by
   providing the End-Point the means to create, update, and terminate a
   context on the LCS to which a specific location URI set is bound.
   Terminating the context therefore explicitly voids the location URI
   ending the ability of a third-party to locate the Target.

   In addition to context management constructs this document also
   provides a set of guidelines to be followed by designers of future
   context data extensions.

2.  Terminology

   The key conventions and terminology used in this document are defined
   as follows:

   This document reuses the terms Target, as defined in [RFC3693].

   This document uses the term Location Configuration Server, LCS, as
   the node in the access network providing location information to an
   end-point.  This term is also used in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps].

   This document uses the term End-Point to refer to the device or host
   requesting to which contextual information stored on the LCS applies.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Detailed Description

   An End-Device wishing to have a context created on the LCS includes a
   <createContext> element in the <locationRequest>.  Information that
   the End-Point wants in the context is included inside the
   <createContext> element.  Extensibility to the context scheme is
   provided to allow additional elements to added to the context easily.
   The general idea is shown in Figure 1.


   <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
     <locationType>locationURI</locationType>
     <hcx:createContext
             hcx:xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:context"
             hcx:lifeTime="7200">
       <ex1:extension-1
             ex1:xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:ex1">
         <ex1:value>7200</ex1:value>
       </ex1:extension-1>
       <extension-2 xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:ex2"/>
       <extension-3 xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:ex3"/>
       .
       .
       .
       <extension-N xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:exN"/>
     </hcx:createContext>
   </locationRequest>

                       Figure 1: createContext Usage

   An LCS that understands this new element SHALL include a
   <contextResponse> element in the corresponding heldRepsonse message.
   An LCS that does not understand this new element MUST ignore the
   element as per [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery].  The End-
   Point MUST assume that the LCS does not understand context related
   messages if it does not obtain a <contextResponse> element in the
   <heldResponse> message when a context was requested.  Since it is
   impossible to predict in advance which elements and extensions the
   LCS will understand before sending them, a mechanism for the LCS to
   tell the End-Point which elements were understood and used is
   required by each context data extension.  Guidelines for defining
   context data extensions are provided in Section 6.

   An LCS supporting the behaviour described in the previous section may
   respond to the locationRequest of Figure 1 with a response similar to
   Figure 2.

   The End-Point can update information associated with a context by
   sending an <updateContext> element in a locationRequest message,
   along with the data that it wants changed in its context.  Elements
   previously provided to the LCS but not included in the
   <updateContext> data set SHALL remain unchanged.  The End-Point MUST
   include the "id" attribute that it received as part of the
   <contextResponse> with any <updateContext> request to clearly
   identify the changing context to the LCS.  This is important because
   in some circumstances an End-Point may be behind a firewall or NAT so
   the LCS can't distinguish the End-Point creating the context from
   other devices behind the same NAT.  The "id" makes this distinction
   possible.

4.  Location URI and id Generation Rules

   A primary aim of this specification is to provide an End-Point with
   the ability to void a location URI when it is associated with a
   context.  To achieve this, a location URI generated as part of a
   context creation needs to be unique with in the scope of the LCS, and
   applicable only to that context.  If the End-Point destroys a context
   and then subsequently creates a new one, URIs associated the new
   context MUST be different from those generated for the previous
   context.

   The context id provided by the LCS to the End-Point in the
   <contextResponse> MUST be unique per context, and SHOULD be different
   from the identifier provided in any generated location URI.  This
   latter constraint ensures that possession of a location URI does not
   automatically provide access and control over the internals of the
   context.

   A context id is generated by an LCS to uniquely identify a context.
   The context id MUST NOT include any information that could be used to
   identify the Target or End-Point.  Similarly, it MUST NOT be feasible
   for a third-party to easily determine a context id by knowing the
   identity of the Target or End-Point.  This implies that internal
   correlation (using a hash-table or similar) is the only method that
   the LCS can use to associate a context id with a particular End-
   Point.

6.  Guidelines For Defining Context Data Extensions

   A context contains specific information about an End-Point and is
   stored on the LCS.  It is impossible to predetermine all information
   that an End-Point may want or need stored in a context so the context
   control mechanisms need to be flexible to allow easy extensibility.
   When defining context data extensions it is necessary to consider how
   they will be used; this includes not only how to provide the
   information from the End-Point to the LCS, but also acceptance and
   error indications from the LCS back to the End-Point.  For example a
   context may be created with several extensions included, how does the
   LCS indicate that extensions 1 and 3 were successful but that
   extension 2 had a problem in its formatting?  Guidelines for
   designing context extensions that provide functionality are described
   in this section.

   Two basic types of context data extension are envisioned.  The first
   consist of data provided by the End-Point to be consumed by the LCS;
   for example information pertaining to PIDF-LO construction, usage-
   rules, and authorization policies.  The second type of data consists
   of a two way exchange between the End-Device and the LCS; for example
   exchanging location determination capabilities.

   When defining a context data extension it is necessary to ensure that
   the LCS can provide an adequate response to the End-Point application
   indicating acceptance or rejection of the data provided.  This may be
   an explicit OK or FAIL message within the extension namespace, or it
   may be an attribute associated with part of a larger data exchange.
   Either way it is mandatory for a context data extension to provide
   this functionality.

   When defining information to be included in a context data extension
   consideration should be given to how that data can be removed from
   the context.  In some cases it may be necessary to void the context
   on the LCS in order to remove information, but this SHOULD be treated
   as a last resort and not used as the primary mechanism for removing
   data from the context.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are several security concerns associated with the details in
   this specification.  The first is to do with the nature of the
   sensitivity of any data passed from the End-Point to the LCS for
   inclusion in a context.  The second is the ability of the LCS to
   contain the number of contexts that it will permit to exist for a
   given End-Point address.

   HELD [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] mandates the use of
   TLS for exchanges between an End-Point and the LCS.  This is deemed
   sufficiently secure to hide any contextual data from a would-be
   eavesdropper while the data is in transit.  The LCS implementation
   and the operator of the LCS need to take sufficient steps to ensure
   that active contextual data on the LCS is not readily available to
   anyone other than the End-Point that owns the data.  The End-Point
   MUST not provide any information to the LCS that it does not want the
   LCS to know or be able to use in some capacity associated with
   determination or providing of the End-Point's location.  The LCS
   SHALL not use any context information provided to it by an End-Point
   except to assist it with the determination and generation of location
   information associated with the End-Point.

   It is quite conceivable that an LCS will be required to provide
   location to end hosts residing behind a NAT; a DSL home router with 5
   PCs attached is a good example this situation.  In this case it is
   reasonable for each device to create its own context on the LCS, and
   for the LCS to treat each context individually even though the LCS
   cannot make any other distinction between the end hosts; that is,
   they share a common IP address/identity from the LCS perspective.  It
   may even be reasonable in some situations for a single device to want
   more than one context.  This environment however opens the LCS to a
   type of denial of service attack through an overload on contexts.  It
   is RECOMMENDED that an implementor of this specification include
   mechanisms to restrict to maximum number of contexts that can be
   created on the LCS by an individual End-Point.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that an LCS operator impose limits on context creation such that it
   is restricted to a sustainable level.

   This specification provides the ability to for an End-Point to void a
   location URI which extends the End-Point's ability to enforce it
   rights to privacy.  Using the mechanisms described in this memo an
   End-Point can create URIs with short validity periods, this restricts
   how long a third-party is able to obtain the location of the End-
   Point while still allowing the End-Point the convenience of using a
   location reference.  Using short-term location URIs in a carefully
   controlled manner may obviate the need for individual location
   authorization policies on the LCS.  This leads to reduced LCS

   complexity and the amount of private information that the End-Point
   need share with the LCS.

   The generation of context identifiers by the LCS is a critical
   component to supporting the functionality described in this memo.
   The LCS MUST follow the rules described in Section 4 for generating
