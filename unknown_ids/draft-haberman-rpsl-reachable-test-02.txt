Abstract

   The deployment of new IP connectivity typically results in
   intermittent reachability for numerous reasons which are outside the
   scope of this document.  In order to aid in the debugging of these
   persistent problems, this document proposes the creation of a new
   Routing Policy Specification Language attribute that allows a network
   to advertise an IP address which is reachable and can be used as a
   target for diagnostic tests (e.g., pings).

Internet-Draft           RPSL Pingable Attribute           November 2009


1.  Introduction

   The deployment of new IP connectivity typically results in
   intermittent reachability for numerous reasons which are outside the
   scope of this document.  In order to aid in the debugging of these
   persistent problems, this document proposes the creation of a new
   Routing Policy Specification Language attribute [RFC4012] that allows
   a network to advertise an IP address which is reachable and can be
   used as a target for diagnostic tests (e.g., pings).

   The goal of this diagnostic address is to provide operators a means
   to advertise selected hosts that can be targets of tests for such
   common issues as reachability and Path MTU discovery.

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  RPSL Extension for Diagnostic Address

   Network operators wishing to provide a diagnostic address for its
   peers, customers, etc. can advertise its existence via the Routing
   Policy Specification Language [RFC4012] [RFC2622].  The pingable
   attribute is a member of the route and route6 objects in the RPSL.
   The pingable attribute has the following characteristics:

   +-----------+-------------------------------+-----------------------+
   | Attribute |             Value             |          Type         |
   +-----------+-------------------------------+-----------------------+
   |  pingable |       <ipv6-address> or       |       mandatory,      |
   |           |         <ipv4-address>        |      multi-valued     |
   |  ping-hdl |          <nic-handle>         |       mandatory,      |
   |           |                               |      multi-valued     |
   +-----------+-------------------------------+-----------------------+

   The pingable attribute allows a network operator to advertise an IP
   address of a node which should be reachable from outside networks.
   This node can be used as a destination address for diagnostic tests.
   The ping-hdl provides a link to contact information for an entity
   capable of responding to queries concerning the specified IP address.
   An example of using the pingable attribute is shown in Figure 1.

3.  Using the RPSL Pingable Attribute

   The presence of one or more pingable attributes signals to network
   operators that the maintainer of the referenced network is providing
   the address(es) for external diagnostic testing.  Tests involving the
   advertised address(es) SHOULD be rate limited to no more than ten
   probes in a five minute window unless prior arrangements are made
   with the maintainer of the attribute.


4.  IANA Considerations

   None.


5.  Acknowledgements

   Randy Bush and David Farmer provided the original concept for the
   pingable attribute and useful comments on preliminary versions of
   this draft.  Joe Abley provided comments that justified moving the
   attribute to the route/route6 object and the inclusion of a point of
   contact.  Larry Blunk provided useful comments to improve the
   document.
