      <t>This document describes a method for streaming multimedia attachments
      received by a resource constrained and/or mobile device from an IMAP
      server. It allows such clients, which often have limits in storage space
      and bandwidth, to play video and audio e-mail content.</t>

      <t>The document describes a profile for making use of the IMAP URLAUTH
      extension (RFC 4467), the Network Announcement SIP Media Service (RFC
      4240), and the Media Server Control Markup Language (RFC 5022).</t>

      <t>In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
      server respectively. If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to multiple

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>Email clients on resource and/or network constrained devices, such as
      mobile phones, may have difficulties in retrieving and/or storing large
      attachments received in a message. For example, on a poor network link,
      the latency required to download the entire attachment may not be
      acceptable to the user. Conversely, even on a high-speed network, the
      device may not have enough storage space to secure the attachment once
      retrieved.</t>

      <t>For certain media, such as audio and video, there is a solution: the
      media can be streamed to the device, using protocols such as <xref target="RTP">
      RTP</xref>. Streaming can be initiated and controlled using protocols such as
      <xref target="SIP">SIP</xref> and particularly the media server profiles as
      specified in <xref target="NETANN">RFC 4240</xref> or <xref
      target="MSCML"> MSCML</xref>. Streaming the media to the device
      addresses both the latency issue, since the client can start playing the
      media relatively quickly, and the storage issue, since the client does not need
      to store the media locally. A tradeoff is that the media cannot be
      viewed/played when the device is offline.</t>

      <t>Examples of the types of media that would benefit from the ability to
      stream such media to the device include: <list style="symbols">
          <t>Voice or Video mail messages received as an attachment</t>

          <t>Audio clips such as ring tones received as an attachment</t>

          <t>Video clips, such as movie trailers, received as an
          attachment</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The client may wish to present the user with the ability to use
      simple "VCR"-style controls such as pause, fast-forward and rewind. In
      consideration of this, the document presents two alternatives for
      streaming media - a simple mechanism which makes use of the announcement
      service of RFC 4240, and a more complex mechanism which allows VCR
      controls, based on <xref target="MSCML">MSCML (RFC 5022)</xref>. The
      choice of which mechanism to use is up to the client, for
      example it may be
      based on limitations of the client or the configured media server. This
      document presents suggestions for determining which of these
      streaming services are available.</t>

        <t>The proposed mechanism has the following steps: <list
            style="numbers">
            <t>Client determines from MIME headers of a particular message that a
            particular message part (attachment) should be streamed to the
            user. Note that no assumptions are made about how/when/if the
            client contacts the user of the client about this decision. User
            input MAY be required in order to initiate the proposed
            mechanism.</t>

            <t>Client constructs an IMAP URL referencing the message part, and
            uses the <xref target="URLAUTH">GENURLAUTH</xref> command to
            generate a URLAUTH authorized IMAP URL.</t>

            <t>Client connects to a SIP Media Server using the Announcement
            Service as specified in <xref target="NETANN">RFC 4240</xref>, or
            the IVR Service as specified in <xref target="MSCML">RFC
            5022</xref>, and passes the URLAUTH authorized URL to the media
            server.</t>

            <t>Media Server connects to the IMAP Server specified in the
            referenced URL, and uses the IMAP <xref
            target="URLAUTH">URLFETCH</xref> command to retrieve the message
            part.</t>

            <t>Media server streams the retrieved message part to the client
            using <xref target="RTP">RTP</xref>.</t>

            <t>The media server or the client terminate the media streaming, or the streaming ends
              naturally. The SIP session is terminated by either client or server.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>It should be noted that the proposed mechanism makes several
        assumptions about the mobile device, as well as available network services,
        namely: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Mobile device is provisioned with, or obtains via some
	    dynamic mechanism (see Section <xref target="discovery"
	    format="counter"/>), the location of a media
	    server which supports either <xref target="NETANN">RFC
	    4240</xref> and/or <xref target="MSCML">RFC 5022</xref>.</t>

            <t>Media Server(s) used by the mobile device support the <xref
            target="IMAPURL">IMAP URL</xref> scheme for the announcement
            and/or IVR services</t>

            <t>IMAP Server used by the mobile device supports generating
            anonymous IMAP URLs using the URLAUTH mechanism as well as
	    the IMAP <xref target="URLFETCH_BINARY">BINARY</xref> extension</t>
          </list></t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="genurlauth" title="Client use of GENURLAUTH Command"
               toc="default">
        <t>The decision to make use of streaming services for a message part
        will usually be predicated on the content type of the message part.
        Using the capabilities of the IMAP FETCH command, clients determine
        the <xref target="MIME">MIME</xref> Content-Type of particular message
        parts and based on local policies or heuristics, decide that streaming
        for that message part will be attempted.</t>

        <t>Once the client has determined that a particular message part
        requires streaming, the client generates an IMAP URL that refers to
        the message part according to the method described in <xref
        target="IMAPURL">RFC 5092</xref>. The client then begins the process
        of generating an URLAUTH URL, by appending ";EXPIRE=&lt;datetime&gt;"
        and ";URLAUTH=&lt;access&gt;" to the initial URL.</t>

        <t>The ";EXPIRE=&lt;datetime&gt;" parameter is optional, however it
        SHOULD be used, since the use of anonymous URLAUTH authorized URLs is
        a security risk, and doing so ensures that at some point in the
        future, permission to access that URL will cease.</t>

        <t>The &lt;access&gt; portion of the URLAUTH parameter SHOULD be
        'authuser' if a media server discovery mechanism such as that discussed in <xref
        target="discovery"/> specifies that the media server is an
        authorised user of the IMAP server. Without specific prior knowledge
        of such a configuration (either through a suitable discovery mechanism or by
        an out of band mechanism), the client MUST use the 'anonymous' access
        identifier.</t>

        <t>The client uses the URL generated as a parameter to the GENAUTHURL
        command, using the INTERNAL authorization mechanism. The URL returned
        by a successful response to this command will then be passed to the
        media server. If no successful response to the GENURLAUTH command is
        received, then no further action will be possible with respect to
        streaming media to the client.</t>

               title="Client Determination of Media Server Capabilities"
               toc="default">
        <t>Once an authorized IMAP URL has been generated, it is up to the
        client to pass that URL to a suitable media server that is capable of
        retrieving the URL via IMAP, and streaming the content to the client
        using the <xref target="RTP">RTP</xref> protocol.</t>
        
        <t>
          This section specifies the behaviour of clients that have not determined,
          (either statically through configuration, or dynamically through a discovery process
          as discussed in Section <xref target="discovery" format="counter"></xref>),
          the capabilities of the media server with respect to the services (i.e. RFC 4240 or 5022)
          supported by that media server. Clients that have determined those capabilities should use
          the mechanisms described in Section <xref target="netanninvite" format="counter"></xref>
          or Section <xref target="mscmlinvite" format="counter"></xref>, as appropriate.
        </t>

        <t>If the client supports the MSCML IVR service, then it SHOULD attempt
        to contact the media server using the MSCML protocol by sending a SIP
        INVITE which has the service indicator "ivr". Due to issues described
        in <xref target="security"></xref>, the client SHOULD use a suitable
        end-to-end encryption method, such as <xref
        target="SMIME">S/MIME</xref>.</t>

        <t>Assuming the media server responds to the INVITE without error, the
        client can carry on using the MSCML IVR service as specified in <xref
        target="mscmlinvite"></xref>. If the media server responds with an
        error indicating that the "ivr" service is not supported, then if the
        client supports it, the client SHOULD attempt to contact the media
        server using the Announcement Service, as described in <xref
        target="netanninvite"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The following example shows an example SIP INVITE using the "ivr"
        service indicator: <vspace blankLines="1" />

      <section anchor="netanninvite"
               title="Client Use of the Media Server Announcement Service"
               toc="default">
        <t>Assuming the client or media server does not support use of the
        MSCML protocol, the media server announcement service is used, as
        described in <xref target="NETANN">RFC 4240</xref>. This service
        allows the client to send a SIP INVITE to a special username ('annc')
        at the media server (the "announcement" user), supplying the URL
        obtained as per <xref target="genurlauth"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The SIP INVITE is constructed as shown in the examples below; note
        that as per RFC 4240, the play parameter is mandatory, and specifies
        the authorized IMAP URL to be played.</t>

        <t>Examples of valid SIP INVITE URIs sent to the media server
        announcement service:</t>

        <t>If the client receives a 200 (OK) response, the media server has
        successfully retrieved the content from the IMAP server and the
        negotiated RTP stream will shortly begin after the ACK.</t>

        <t>There are many possible response codes, however a response code of 404
          received from the media server 
        indicates that the content could not be found or could not be
        retrieved for some reason. For example, the media server may not
        support the use of IMAP URLs. At this point, there are several options
        to the client, such as using alternate media servers, or giving up in
        attempting to stream the required message part.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="transcoding" title="Media Negotiation and Transcoding">
        <t>This document uses standards and protocols from two traditionally
        separate application areas: Mobile Email (primarily IMAP) and Internet
        Telephony/Streaming (e.g. SIP/RTP). Since the document primarily
        addresses enhancing the capabilities of mobile email, it is felt
        worthwhile to give some examples of simple SIP/SDP exchanges, and
        discussing capabilities such as media negotiation (using SDP) and
        media transcoding.</t>

        <t>In the below example, the client contacts the media server using
        the SIP INVITE command to contact the Announcement service (see <xref
        target="netanninvite"></xref>), advertising support for a range of
        audio and video codecs (using <xref target="SDP">SDP</xref>), and in
        response the media server advertises only a set of audio codecs. This
        process is identical for the IVR service, except that the IVR service
        does not use the SIP Request-URI to indicate the content to be played;
        instead this is carried in a subsequent SIP INFO request.</t>

        <t>The client and server now know from the SDP advertised by both
        client and server that communication must be using the subset of audio
        codecs supported by both client and server (in the example SDP, it is
        clear that the server does not support any video codecs). The media
        server may perform transcoding (i.e. converting between codecs) on the
        media received from the IMAP server in order to satisfy the codecs
        supported by the client: for example the media server may downgrade
        the video retrieved from the IMAP server to the audio component
        only.</t>

        <t>For clients using the Announcement service, the media server MUST
        return an error to the INVITE if it cannot find a common codec between
        the client, server and media, and it cannot transcode to a suitable
        codec. Similarly, for clients using the MSCML IVR service, the media
        server MUST return a suitable error response to the
        &lt;playcollect&gt; request.</t>

      <section anchor="mscmlinvite"
               title="Client Use of the Media Server MSCML IVR Service"
               toc="default">
        <t>Once the client has determined that the media server supports the
        IVR service, it is up to the client to generate a suitable MSCML
        request to initiate streaming of the required media.</t>

        <t>When using the IVR service, the initial SIP invite is used only to
        establish that the media server supports the MSCML IVR service, and to
        negotiate suitable media codecs. Once the initial SIP INVITE and
        response to that INVITE have been completed successfully, the client
        must generate a SIP INFO request with MSCML in the body of the request
        to initiate streaming.</t>

        <t>The &lt;playcollect&gt; request is used, as this allows the use of
        DTMF digits to control playback of the media, such as fast-forward or
        rewind.</t>

        <t>Since the playcollect request is used purely for its VCR
        capabilities, there is no need for the media server to perform DTMF
        collection, therefore the playcollect attributes "firstdigittimer",
        "interdigittimer" and "extradigittimer" SHOULD all be set to "0ms",
        which will have the effect of causing digit collection to cease
        immediately the media has finished playing.</t>

        <t>The "ffkey" and "rwkey" attributes of &lt;playcollect&gt; are used
        to control fast forward and rewind behaviour, with the "skipinterval"
        attribute being used to control the 'speed' of these actions.</t>

        <t>The &lt;prompt&gt; tag is used to specify the media to be played,
        and SHOULD have a single &lt;audio&gt; tag that gives the URL of the
        media, as per the <xref target="genurlauth"></xref>. The
        audio-specific name of the tag is historical, as the tag can be used
        for video as well as audio content. The "stoponerror" attribute SHOULD
        be set to "yes", as then meaningful error messages will be returned by
        the media server in the event of problems such as retrieving the media
        from the IMAP server.</t>

        <t>An example SIP INFO request using the &lt;playcollect&gt; request
        is shown at the end of this section.</t>

        <t>It should be noted that under normal (i.e. non-error) conditions,
        the response to the &lt;playcollect&gt; request is a SIP 200 (OK)
        response. The media server then streams the media, and only when the
        media has finished playing (naturally or due to a user request), does
        the media server send a &lt;playcollect&gt; response, which includes
        details of the media played, such as length, and any digits
        collected.</t>

        <t>The client may suspend playback of the media at any time by either
        sending the DTMF escape key (specified as an attribute to the
        &lt;playcollect&gt; request) or by sending a &lt;stop&gt; request to
        the media server in a SIP INFO request. Upon receipt of the request,
        the media server will acknowledge it, and then cease streaming of the
        media, followed by a SIP INFO request containing the
        &lt;playcollect&gt; response.</t>

        <t>If the media server cannot play the media for any reason, for
        example if it cannot retrieve the media from the IMAP server,
        streaming will not take place, and the &lt;playcollect&gt; response
        will be sent, usually with meaningful values in the &lt;error_info&gt;
        element.</t>

        <t>The following gives an example dialog between a client and media
        server, including a rewind request, and termination of the playback by
        use of the escape key. Some elements of the SIP dialog such as full
        SIP header fields and SDP are omitted for reasons of brevity. (The protocol
        diagram in <xref target="mscml_protocol"></xref> shows the high-level
        message flow between all the components, including the IMAP
        server.)</t>

      <section anchor="urlfetch" title="Media Server Use of IMAP Server">
        <t>This section describes how the media server converts the IMAP URL
        received via the announcement or IVR service into suitable IMAP
        commands for retrieving the content.</t>

        <t>The media server first connects to the IMAP server specified in the
        URL. Once connected, the media server SHOULD use <xref
        target="TLS">TLS</xref> to encrypt the communication path.</t>

        <t>If the media server is configured as an authorized user of the IMAP
        server, it SHOULD authenticate to the IMAP server using the
        credentials for that user. This document does not go into the details
        of IMAP authentication, but the authentication SHOULD NOT use the
        LOGIN command over a non-encrypted communication path.</t>

        <t>If the media server is not configured as an authorized user of the
        IMAP server, then the behaviour specified in <xref target="IMAPURL">
          IMAP URL bis4</xref> MUST be followed. That is, if the server advertises AUTH=ANONYMOUS 
          IMAP capability, the media server MUST use the AUTHENTICATE command 
          with ANONYMOUS [ANONYMOUS] SASL mechanism.  If SASL ANONYMOUS is not 
          available, the user name "anonymous" is used with the "LOGIN" command
          and the password is supplied as the Internet e-mail address of the 
          administrative contact for the media server.</t>

        <t>Once authenticated, the media server issues the URLFETCH command,
        using the URL supplied in the 'play' parameter of the SIP INVITE (or
        audio tag of the MSCML). If the IMAP server does not advertise URLAUTH=BINARY in its
        capability string, then the media server returns a
	suitable error code to the client.</t>
	<t>The additional parameters to the URLFETCH command
        specified in <xref target="URLFETCH_BINARY">(URLFETCH
	BINARY)</xref> are used by the media server to tell the IMAP
	server to remove any transfer encoding and return the content
	type of the media (as content type information is not
	contained in the IMAP URL).
        </t>
	<t> 
        A successful URLFETCH command will return the message part
        containing the media to be streamed.
        If the URLFETCH was unsuccessful, then the media server MUST return an
        appropriate error code to the client with an appropriate reason
        code.</t>

        <t>Assuming the content is retrieved successfully, the
        media server returns a 200 (OK) response code to the client. After an
        ACK is received, an RTP stream is delivered to the client using the
        parameters negotiated in the SDP.</t>

        <t>If appropriate, the media server MAY choose to implement connection
        caching, in which case connection and disconnection from the IMAP
        server are handled according to whatever algorithm the media server
        chooses. For example, the media server may know, a priori, that it
        will always access the same IMAP server using the same login
        credentials with an access pattern that would benefit from connection
        caching, without unduly impacting server resources.</t>

      <section anchor="discovery"
               title="Media Server Discovery"
               toc="default">
        <t>This section discusses possibilities for the automatic
	discovery of suitable media servers to perform streaming
	operations. Defining such a mechanism to perform media server
	discovery is outside the scope of this document, however it is
	worthwhile exploring the issues involved.</t>
        <t>
        There are two possibilities for clients with regard to determining
        the hostname and port number information of a suitable media server:
        <list style="numbers">
            <t>No discovery of media servers is required: clients are
            configured with suitable media server information in an
            out-of-band manner.</t>

            <t>Discovery of media servers is required: clients use the
            discovery mechanism described in this section to determine a
            suitable media server to use for streaming multimedia message
            parts.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>There are several scenarios where media server discovery would be a
        requirement for streaming to be successful: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Client is not configured with the address of any media
            servers.</t>

            <t>Client is configured with the address of one or more media
            servers, but the IMAP server is configured to only accept URLFETCH
            requests from specific media servers (for security or site policy
            reasons), and thus streaming would fail due to the media server
            not being able to retrieve the media from the IMAP server.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>There is also a scenario where media server location would improve
        the security of the streaming mechanism, by avoiding the use of
        completely anonymous URLs. For example, the client could
        discover a media server address that was an authorised user of the IMAP
	server, which would allow the client to generate a URL,
	which was secure in that it could *only* be accessed by a
	specific (presumably trusted) media server.</t>

        <t>One possible solution could involve using the IMAP <xref
        target="METADATA">METADATA</xref> extension, via the use of an entry
        that provides the contact information for suitable media servers for
        use with the IMAP server, as well as perhaps the streaming
	services provided by those media server. Media
	Server discovery should be optional: clients
        are free to use pre-configured information about media
	servers, or to fall-back to such information if no suitable
	discovery mechanism is available.

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>This document proposes the use of <xref target="URLAUTH">URLAUTH</xref>
        "pawn tickets", received over <xref target="IMAP">IMAP</xref>, and transmitted 
        over <xref target="SIP">SIP</xref>, possibly within the MSCML payload of 
        <xref target="MSCML">RFC 5022</xref>, in order to stream media received in messages.
        As such, the security considerations in all these documents apply to this specification.
      </t>
      <t>In summary, as the authorized URLs may grant access to data, implementors of this 
        specification need to consider the following:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Use of an anonymous pawn ticket grants
            access to any client of the IMAP server without requiring any
            authentication credentials. Even if one grants an authorized pawn
            ticket, any client that happens to be an
            authorized user of the IMAP server will have access granted. The security mechanisms 
            referenced above SHOULD be used to prevent unauthorized access to the pawn ticket.
          </t>  
          <t>If the announcement service is used to set up streaming, then 
             <xref target="NETANN">RFC 4240</xref> specifies that the
             pawn ticket is passed in the Request-URI. Thus, if the SIP communication channel is not
             secured with TLS (e.g. using the <xref target="SIP">sips URI scheme</xref>), untrusted 
             third-parties may be able to
             intercept the pawn ticket. Using sips in this situation protects the pawn ticket from untrusted
             third-parties, however, it still allows proxies access to the pawn ticket. 
          </t>
          <t>
            To fully protect the pawn ticket, the IVR service, 
            <xref target="MSCML">RFC 5022</xref>, which uses MSCML to carry the pawn ticket in the body 
            of the request, is RECOMMENDED,  using an end-to-end encryption of the MSCML payload, 
            such as <xref target="SMIME">S/MIME</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the media server location is retrieved from the IMAP
            server (see Section <xref target="discovery" format="counter"></xref>), there is an
            implicit level of trust in the media server used, since the media server has
            access to both the pawn ticket and the content to be streamed. Trust in media servers
            configured by out-of-band mechanisms is beyond the scope of this document.

    <section anchor="drm" title="Digital Rights Management (DRM) Issues">
      <t>This document does not specify any Digital Rights Management (DRM)
      mechanisms for controlling access to and copying of the media to be
      streamed. This is intentional. A reference to a piece of media content
      is created using the <xref target="URLAUTH">URLAUTH</xref> command; 
      any DRM required thus should be implemented within the media itself, 
      as implementing checks within URLAUTH could affect any use of the URLAUTH
      command, such as the <xref target="BURL">BURL</xref> command for message
      submission.</t>
      
      <t>The use of URLAUTH in this specification is believed to be pursuant with,
        and used only for, the execution of those rights to be expected when media
        is sent via traditional internet messaging, and causes no duplication of 
        media content which is not essentially provided by the action of sending the 
        message; that is, the use of the content for downloading and viewing, which 
        *is* implicitly granted by the sender of the message, in as much as the sender
        has the right to grant such rights.
      </t>
      
      <t>The document authors believe that if DRM is a requirement for Internet
      messaging, then a suitable DRM mechanism should be created. How such a
      mechanism would work is outside the scope of this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="deployment" title="Deployment Considerations">
        <t>This document assumes an Internet deployment where there are no
        network restrictions between the different components. Specifically,
        it does not address issues that can occur when network policies
        restrict the communication between different components, especially
        between the media server and the IMAP server, and between the client
        the media server. In particular, RFC 5022 states that "It is unlikely, 
        but not prohibited, for end-user SIP UACs to have a direct signaling 
        relationship with a media server." This caveat makes it likely
        that firewalls and other network security mechanisms will be configured
        to block direct end-user access to media servers.
        </t>
        <t>In order for either of the streaming mechanisms described in this document
        to work, local administrators MUST relax firewalls policies such that appropriate
        SIP UACs running on mobile devices are permitted to access the media servers
        directly using the SIP protocol. The detail of how the restrictions are
        relaxed, (for example,
        only allowing clients connecting from the network space owned/maintained 
        by the operator of the media server) is a matter of local policy, and so is 
        outside the scope of this document.
