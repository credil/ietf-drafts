                      The SPF/Sender-ID Experiment
                  draft-kucherawy-spfbis-experiment-00

Abstract

   In 2006 the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising
   SPF and Sender-ID, two proposed email authentication protocols.
   Because of interoperability concerns and the inability of the working
   group producing them to converge on a single specification, the IESG
   required them to have Experimental status and invited the community
   to observe their deployments for a period of time, hoping convergence
   would be possible later.

   After six years, sufficient experience and evidence have been
   collected that the experiment thus created can be considered
   concluded, and a common path toward can be selected.  This memo
   presents those findings.

Internet-Draft          SPF/Sender-ID Experiment           February 2012


1.  Introduction

   In April, 2006, the MARID working group published the [SPF] and
   [SUBMITTER]/[SENDER-ID]/[PRA] email authentication protocols.  Both
   of these enabled one to publish via the Domain Name System a policy
   declaring which mail servers were authorized to send email on behalf
   of a specific domain name.  The two protocols made use of this policy
   statement and some specific (but different) logic to evaluate whether
   or not the email client sending or relaying a message was authorized
   to do so.

   Because Sender-ID could use the same policy statement as SPF, the
   IESG at the time was concerned that an implementation of Sender-ID
   might erroneously apply that statement to a message and, depending on
   selected recipient actions, could improperly interfere with message
   delivery.  As a result, the IESG required the publication of all of
   these documents as Experimental, and requested that the community
   observe deployment and operation of the protocols over a period of
   two years from publication in order to determine a reasonable path
   forward.

   This working group has convened to resolve this experiment and
   propose advancement of a single protocol going forward.  This memo
   presents evidence on both deployment and efficacy of the two
   protocols, and further discusses the increasing need for convergence.
   At the end it presents conclusions and recommends a path forward, as
   the IESG requested.


2.  The Need For Convergence

   These two protocols fall into a family of protocols that provide
   domain-level email authentication services.  Another prominent one is
   [DKIM].  Various efforts exist that use these as building blocks to
   increased abuse filtering capabilties, and indeed this sort of work
   has spawned another working group in the Applications area, with
   still more of these incubating in associations and trade groups
   outside of the IETF.

   There is thus some palpable interest in having a path authorization
   scheme, as well as a domain-level signing scheme, on the Standards
   Track so that these newer technologies can develop.  This is, in
   part, why the community has decided to expend the energy to bring
   this experiment to a conclusion and document the results.

3.  Evidence of Deployment

   A query of approximately 287,000 domains known to be publishing SPF
   policy records in some way revealed that only 1.63% of them published
   using the SPF resource record type.  This suggests that using SPF
   records as a way of separating SPF processing from Sender-ID
   processing is not a reliable heuristic.  For sites that published
   both SPF and TXT RRs, as many as 17% of these actually included
   separate policies, which suggests that keeping the two synchronized
   could actually be an operational concern.  It is possible, but
   considered unlikely, that the deviation was deliberate in the
   observed cases.

   Further analysis suggests that of that same large set of domains,
   approximately 1,200, or fewer than 1%, published Sender-ID records
   (identified by "v=spf2").

   It is likely impossible to determine from a survey which MTAs have
   SPF or Sender-ID checking enabled at message ingress since it does
   not appear, for example in the reply to the EHLO command from
   extended [SMTP].


4.  Evidence of Differences

   Specific data collected by multiple independent working group
   contributors (see Appendix A) shows that in more than 95% of cases,
   Sender-ID and SPF reach the same conclusion about a message.  Given
   the data presented in the previous section, this means the domains
   found in PRA-selected header fields in the message matched the
   RFC5321.MailFrom domain.

   [other data TBD]


5.  Conclusions

   Given the evidence above, the working group feels that the experiment
   allows the following conclusions:

7.  Security Considerations

   This memo contains information for the community only, akin to an
   implementation report, and does not introduce any new security
   concerns.  Its implications could, in fact, resolve some.
