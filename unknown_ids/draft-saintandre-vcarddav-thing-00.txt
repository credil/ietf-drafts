Internet-Draft              vCard KIND:thing                  April 2011


1.  Introduction

   Version 4 of the vCard specification [VCARD] defines a new KIND
   property that specifies the type of entity that a vCard represents.
   During working group discussion of that specification, the "thing"
   value of the KIND property was removed, with the expectation that the
   value might be defined in a vCard extension.  This document defines
   such an extension.


2.  Meaning

   When the KIND property has a value of "thing", the vCard represents a
   software application (e.g.,a server, a chatroom, or a bot) or a
   physical object (e.g., a building or a machine).  As one example of
   the "thing" KIND, vCards are currently used in the Extensible
   Messaging and Presence Protocol [XMPP] to represent instant messaging
   servers that are deployed on the network.

   All properties in a thing's vCard apply to one of the following:

   o  The thing itself (e.g., the FN property might represent the
      friendly name of an application service, the URL property might
      represent a website that contains further information about the
      service, and the ADR, GEO, and TZ properties might represent the
      physical address, geographical location, and timezone of the
      machine where the service is hosted).
   o  An organization or person that owns the thing (e.g., the LOGO
      property might represent the corporate logo of a service
      provider).
   o  A person or role that controls the thing (e.g., the TEL, EMAIL,
      and IMPP properties might represent ways to contact a server
      administrator).

   The following base properties make sense for vCards that represent
   things (this list is not exclusive, and other properties might be
   applicable as well):

   o  FN
   o  ADR
   o  TEL
   o  EMAIL
   o  IMPP
   o  LANG
   o  TZ
   o  GEO

Internet-Draft              vCard KIND:thing                  April 2011


   o  LOGO
   o  URL
   o  KEY


3.  Example

   The following example of an XMPP server is borrowed from [XMPP-VCARD]
   and uses the XML representation of vCard described in [VCARDXML].

   <vcard xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:vcard-4.0">
     <vcards>
       <fn><text>jabber.org IM service</text></fn>
       <url><uri>http://www.jabber.org/</uri></url>
       <lang>
         <parameters><pref>1</pref></parameters>
         <language-tag>en</language-tag>
       </lang>
       <email>
         <parameters><type><text>work</text></type></parameters>
         <text>xmpp@jabber.org</text>
       </email>
       <impp>
         <parameters><type><text>work</text></type></parameters>
         <uri>xmpp:jabber.org</uri>
       </impp>
       <logo>
         <parameters><type><text>work</text></type></parameters>
         <uri>http://www.jabber.org/images/logo.png</uri>
       </logo>
       <geo>
         <parameters><type><text>work</text></type></parameters>
         <uri>geo:42.25,-91.05</uri>
       </geo>
       <tz><text>America/Chicago</text></tz>
       <kind><text>thing</text></kind>
     </vcard>
   </vcards>


4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add "thing" to the registry of property
   values for vCard4.  In conformance with Section 10.2.6 of [VCARD],
   the registration is as follows, where the reference is to XXXX.

Internet-Draft              vCard KIND:thing                  April 2011


   Value:  thing
   Purpose:  The object represented by the vCard is an automated entity,
      such as a software application or a physical object.
   Conformance:  This value can be used with the "KIND" property.
   Example:  See Section 3 of XXXX.


5.  Security Considerations

   Use of vCards to represent non-human entities is not envisioned to
   introduce security considerations beyond those specified for vCards
   in general as described in [VCARD].
