1. Introduction 

   Over the past several years MPLS networks have gained greater 
   popularity. However, there is no standard method to compare and 
 
 
Akhter & Asati           Expires March, 2009                   [Page 2] 

Internet-Draft      MPLS Benchmarking Methodology         November 2008 
    

   contrast the varying implementations and their strong and weak 
   points. This document proposes a methodology using common criteria 
   for the comparison of various implementations of basic MPLS 
   forwarding devices. 

   The terms used in this document remain consistent with those defined 
   in "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect Devices" 
   RFC1242 [RFC1242]. This terminology SHOULD be consulted before using 
   or applying the recommendations of this document. 

    

2. Document Scope 

   The purpose of this draft is to describe a methodology specific to 
   the benchmarking of MPLS forwarding devices. The scope of this 
   benchmarking will be limited to various types of packet-forwarding 
   and delay measurements in a laboratory setting. It builds upon the 
   tenets set forth in RFC2544 [RFC2544], RFC1242 [RFC1242] and other 
   IETF Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) efforts. 

   MPLS [RFC3031] is a foundation enabling technology for other more 
   advanced technologies such as Layer 3 MPLS-VPNs, Layer 2 MPLS-VPNs, 
   and MPLS Traffic Engineering. This document focuses on MPLS 
   forwarding characterization. This document is not a replacement for, 
   but a complement to, RFC 2544. 

    

    

3. Key Words to Reflect Requirements 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 
   [RFC2119].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make 
   the intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While 
   this document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards 
   track document. 

    

4. Test Methodology 

   The set of methodologies described in this document will use the 
   topologies described in this section. An effort has been made to 
 
 
Akhter & Asati           Expires March, 2009                   [Page 3] 

Internet-Draft      MPLS Benchmarking Methodology         November 2008 
    

   exclude superfluous equipment needs such that each test can be 
   carried out with the minimum number of requirements. 

   Figure 1 illustrates the sample topology in which the DUT is 
   connected to the test ports on the test tool. 

                    +-----------------+ 
    +---------+     |                 |     +---------+ 
    | Test    |     |                 |     | Test    | 
    | Port A1 +-----+ DA1         DB1 -----+ Port B1 |

    +---------+     |                 |     +---------+ 
         ...        |                 |        ... 
    +---------+     |                 |     +---------+ 
    | Test    |     +-----------------+     | Test    |

           Figure 1 Topology #1 for MPLS Forwarding Benchmarking 

    

   p = number of ports; determined by the maximum unidirectional 
   forwarding throughput of the DUT and the load capacity of the media 
   between the Test Ports and DUT.  

   For example, if the DUT's forwarding throughput is 100 frames per 
   second (fps), and the media capacity is 50 fps, then p = 2.  

   The exact throughput is a measured quantity obtained through 
   testing. Throughput may vary depending on the number of ports used, 
   and other factors. The number of ports used (p) SHOULD be reported 
   for both Tx and Rx sides of DUT. Please see Test Setup in section 6. 

     

4.1. Test Considerations 

   This methodology assumes a full-duplex uniform medium topology. The 
   medium used MUST be reported in each test result. Issues regarding 
   mixed transmission media, speed mismatches, media header differences 
   etc, are not under consideration. Traffic-affecting features such as 
   Flow control, QoS, Graceful Restart etc. MUST be disabled, unless 
 
 
Akhter & Asati           Expires March, 2009                   [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft      MPLS Benchmarking Methodology         November 2008 
    

   explicitly requested in the test case. Additionally, any non-
   essential traffic MUST also be avoided. 

    

4.1.1. IGP Support 

   It is highly RECOMMENDED that all of the interfaces (A1, DA1, DB1, 
   A2..) on DUT and test tool support an IGP such as IS-IS, OSPF, 
   EIGRP, RIP etc. Furthermore, there are testing considerations in 
   this document that the device is able to provide a stable control-
   plane during heavy forwarding workloads. The route distribution 
   method used (OSPF, IS-IS, EIGRP, RIP etc.) MUST be reported. 

    

4.1.2. Label Distribution Support 

   The DUT and test tool must support at least one protocol for 
   exchanging MPLS labels. The DUT and test tool MUST be capable of 
   learning and advertising MPLS label bindings via the chosen 
   protocol(s), and use them during packet forwarding all the time 
   (including when the label bindings change). The most commonly used 
   protocols are Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036], Resource 
   Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) [RFC5151] and 
   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC3107]. 

   All of the interfaces connected to the DUT such as A1, DA1, DB1, A2 
   etc., SHOULD support LDP, RSVP-TE, and BGP for IPv4 or IPv6 
   Forwarding Equivalence Classes (FECs).  

   This document discourages the use of static label to establish the 
   MPLS label switched paths, since it is not commonly used in the 
   production networks. 

    

4.1.3. Frame Sizes 

   Each test SHOULD be run with different (layer 2) frame sizes in 
   different trials. The recommended sizes for IPv4 are 64, 128, 256, 
   512, 1024, 1280 and 1518. Recommended sizes for other media can be 
   found in RFC 2544 and IPv6 Benchmarking [RFC5180]. Frame sizes MUST 
   be based on the pre-MPLS shim version of the frame. 

   In addition to the individual frame size trials, results MAY also be 
   collected with multiple simultaneous frame sizes (sometimes referred 
 
 
Akhter & Asati           Expires March, 2009                   [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft      MPLS Benchmarking Methodology         November 2008 
    

   to as an IMIX to simulate real network traffic according to the 
   frame size ordering and usage). There is no standard for mixtures of 
   frame sizes, and the results are subject to wide interpretation. See 
   section 18 of RFC 2544. 

   When running trials using multiple simultaneous frame sizes, the DUT 
   configuration MUST remain the same.  

    

4.1.4. Time-to-Live (TTL) or Hop Limit 

   The MPLS TTL or IPv4 TTL or IPv6 Hop Limit (depending on which 
   portion of the frame the DUT is basing the forwarding behavior) MUST 
   be large enough to traverse the DUT.  

   If TTL/Hop Limit Decrement is a configurable option on the DUT, the 
   setting SHOULD be reported. 

    

4.1.5. Trial Duration 

   Unless otherwise specified, the test portion of each trial SHOULD be 
   no less than 30 seconds when static routing is in place, and no less 
   than 200 seconds when a dynamic routing protocol and LDP (default 
   LDP holddown timer is 180 seconds) are being used. 

   The longer trial time used for dynamic routing protocols is to 
   verify that the DUT is able to maintain a stable control plane when 
   the data-forwarding plane is under stress. 

    

4.1.5.1. Traffic Verification 

   In all cases, sent traffic MUST be accounted for, whether it was 
   received on the wrong port, correct port or not received at all. 
   Specifically, traffic loss (also referred to as frame loss) is 
   defined as the traffic (i.e. one or more frames) not received where 
   expected (i.e. received on incorrect port, or received with 
   incorrect layer2 or above header information etc.). In addition, 
   presence or absence of MPLS header, ethertype (0x8847 vs. 0x0800), 
   checksum, frame sequencing and correct MPLS TTL decrementing, MUST 
   be verified in the received frame.

Internet-Draft      MPLS Benchmarking Methodology         November 2008 
    

   Many test tools may, by default, only verify that they have received 
   the embedded signature on the receive side. However, for MPLS header 
   presence verification, some tests will require the MPLS header to be 
   imposed while others will require a swap or disposition. Hence, this 
   document requires the test tool to verify the MPLS stack depth. An 
   even greater level of verification would be to check if the correct 
   label was imposed, but that is out of scope for these tests. 

    

4.1.6. Address Resolution and Dynamic Protocol State 

   If the test or media is making use of a dynamic protocol (eg ARP, 
   OSPF, LDP), all state for the protocols should be pre-established 
   before the start of the trial. 

    

4.1.7. Abbreviations Used 

   Please refer to Figure 1, "Port based Remote Network" for a topology 
   view of the network. The following abbreviations are used in this 
   document - 

   M  := Module Side (could be A or B) 

   P  := port number  

   RN := Remote Network (can also be thought of as a network that is 
   reachable via Mp). 

   Y  := number of network. (i.e. the first network reachable via B1 
   would be called B1RN1 and the 5th network would be called B1RN5) 

      

5. Reporting Format 

   For each test case, it is RECOMMENDED that the following variables 
   be reported in addition to the specific parameters requested by the 
   test case:

6. MPLS Forwarding Benchmarking Tests 

   MPLS is a different forwarding paradigm from IP. Unlike IP packet 
   and IP forwarding, an MPLS packet may contain more than one MPLS 
   header and may go through one of three forwarding operations - 
   imposition, swap and disposition. Such characteristics desire 
   further granularity in MPLS forwarding benchmarking than those 
   described in RFC2544. Thus the benchmarking includes, but is not 
   limited to:  

     1. Throughput 

     2. Latency

Internet-Draft      MPLS Benchmarking Methodology         November 2008 
    

     3. Frame Loss rate 

     4. System Recovery 

     5. Reset 

     6. MPLS EXP field Operations (including explicit-null cases) 

     7. Negative Scenarios (TTL expiry, etc) 

     8. Multicast 

 

   This document focuses on the first five categories, inline with the 
   spirit of RFC2544. All the benchmarking test cases described in this 
   document are expected to, at a minimum, follow the 'Test Setup' and 
   'Test Procedure' below -  

 

   Test Setup 

     Referring to Figure 1, a single A and B interface SHOULD be used 
     (p = 1 SHOULD be used). However, if the forwarding throughput of 
     the DUT is more than that of the media rate of a single interface, 
     then additional A and B interfaces MUST be enabled so as to exceed 
     the DUT's forwarding throughput. In such case, the tool traffic 
     should use IP addresses assigned to BpRN1 and BpAN as the IP 
     destinations and conform to section 16 of RFC 2544. 

      

   Test Procedure (Refer to section 26 of RFC 2544) 

     Send traffic from port(s) Ap towards DUT at a constant load 
     towards IP prefixes (BpRN1 addresses) advertised by the tool on 
     the receive ports, for a fixed time interval.  

     If any frame loss is detected, a new iteration is needed where the 
     offered load is decreased and the sender will transmit again. An 
     iterative search algorithm MUST be used to determine the maximum 
     offered frame rate with a zero frame loss. 

     Each iteration should involve varying the offered load of the 
     traffic, while keeping the other parameters (test duration, number 
     of interfaces, number of addresses, frame size etc) constant,

     until the maximum rate at which none of the offered frames are 
     dropped is determined.

6.1. Throughput 

   This section contains the description of the tests that are related 
   to the characterization of DUT's MPLS traffic forwarding.  

    

6.1.1. Throughput for MPLS Label Imposition  

   Objective 

     To obtain the DUT's Throughput (as per RFC 2544) during label 
     imposition (i.e. IP to MPLS).  

   Test Setup 

     In addition to setup described in section 6, the test tool should 
     advertise the IP prefix(es) i.e. RNx(using a routing protocol as 
     per section 1.1) and associated MPLS label (using a label 
     distribution protocol as per section 1.2) on its receive ports Bp 
     to DUT. The test tool may learn these IP prefixes on its transmit 
     ports Ap from DUT. 

   Discussion 

     The DUT's MPLS forwarding table must contain a non-reserved MPLS 
     label value as the outgoing label for the learned prefix, 
     resulting in IP-to-MPLS forwarding operation. The test tool must 
     receive MPLS packets on receive ports Bp (from DUT) with the same 
     label values that are advertised. 

   Procedure 

     Please see Test Procedure in section 6. Additionally, the test 
     tool MUST send unlabeled IP packets on transmit ports Ap (with IP 
     destination belonging to above IP prefix(es)), and expect to 
     receive MPLS packets on receive ports Bp.  

   Reporting Format 

     Same as RFC2544 and the parameters of section 5. 

     Results for each test SHOULD be in the form of a table with a row 
     for each of the tested frame sizes. Additional columns SHOULD 
     include: offered load and measured throughput.

6.1.2. Throughout for MPLS Label Swap  

   Objective 

     To obtain the DUT's Throughput (as per RFC 2544) during label 
     swapping (i.e. MPLS to MPLS).  

   Test Setup 

     In addition to setup described in section 6, the test tool must be 
     set up to advertise IP prefix (using a routing protocol as per 
     section 1.1) and associated MPLS label (using a label distribution 
     protocol as per section 1.2) on the receive ports Bp, and learn 
     the IP prefix(es) with the appropriate MPLS labels on the transmit 
     ports Ap. The test tool then must use the learned MPLS label 
     values and learned IP prefix values in MPLS packets transmitted on 
     ports Ap.  

   Discussion 

     The DUT's MPLS forwarding table must contain non-reserved MPLS 
     label values as the outgoing and incoming labels for the learned 
     prefix, resulting in MPLS-to-MPLS forwarding operation. The test 
     tool must receive MPLS packets on receive ports Bp (from DUT). The 
     received MPLS packets must contain the same number of MPLS headers 
     as those of transmitted MPLS Packets. 

   Procedure 

     Please see Test Procedure in section 6. Additionally, the test 
     tool must send MPLS packets on its transmit ports Ap (with IP 
     destination belonging to advertised IP prefix(es)), and expect to 
     receive MPLS packets on its receive ports Bp.  

   Reporting Format 

     Same as RFC2544 and the parameters of section 5. 

     Results for each test SHOULD be in the form of a table with a row 
     for each of the tested frame sizes.

6.1.3. Throughout for MPLS Label Disposition  

   Objective 

     To obtain the DUT's Throughput (as per RFC 2544) during label 
     disposition (i.e. MPLS to IP) using "Untagged" outgoing label. 

   Test Setup 

     In addition to setup described in section 6, the test tool must be 
     set up to advertise the IP prefix(es) (using a routing protocol as 
     per section 1.1) without any MPLS label on the receive ports Bp, 
     and learn the IP prefix(es) with the appropriate MPLS labels on 
     the transmit ports Ap. The test tool then must use the learned 
     MPLS label values and learned IP prefix values in MPLS packets 
     transmitted on ports Ap.  

   Discussion 

     The DUT's MPLS forwarding table must contain an untagged outgoing 
     label for the learned prefix, resulting in MPLS-to-IP forwarding 
     operation. The test tool must receive IP packets on receive ports 
     Bp (from DUT). 

   Procedure 

     Please see Test Procedure in section 6. Additionally, the test 
     tool must send MPLS packets on its transmit ports Ap (with IP 
     destination belonging to advertised IP prefix(es)), and expect to 
     receive IP packets on its receive ports Bp.  

   Reporting Format 

     Same as RFC2544 and the parameters of section 5.

6.1.4. Throughput for MPLS Label Disposition (Aggregate) 

   Objective 

     To obtain the DUT's Throughput (as per RFC 2544) during label 
     disposition (i.e. MPLS to IP) using "Aggregate" outgoing label. 

   Test Setup 

     In addition to setup described in section 6, the DUT should be 
     provisioned such that it allocates an aggregate outgoing label to 
     a prefix (where the prefix may be a 'BGP aggregated prefix' , 'BGP 
     VPN connected prefix' or an IGP aggregation that results in an 
     aggregate label, etc. and must include the addresses belonging to 
     the DUT receive ports Bp). 

     The DUT must advertise the IP prefix(es) along with the MPLS 
     label(s) via a label distribution protocol to the test tool on 
     tool transmit ports Ap. 

     The test tool then must use the learned MPLS label values and 
     learned IP prefix values in MPLS packets transmitted on ports Ap.  

   Discussion 

     The DUT's MPLS forwarding table must contain an aggregate outgoing 
     label and IP forwarding table must contain a valid entry for the 
     learned prefix, resulting in MPLS-to-IP forwarding operation (i.e. 
     MPLS header removal followed by IP lookup). The test tool must 
     receive IP packets on receive ports Bp (from DUT). 

   Procedure 

     Please see Test Procedure in section 6. Additionally, the test 
     tool must send MPLS packets on its transmit ports Ap (with IP 
     destination belonging to advertised IP prefix(es)), and expect to 
     receive IP packets on its receive ports Bp.  

   Reporting Format 

     Same as RFC2544 and the parameters of section 5. 

     Results for each test SHOULD be in the form of a table with a row 
     for each of the tested frame sizes.

7. Security Considerations 

   Benchmarking activities, as described in this memo, are limited to 
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory 
   environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints 
   specified in the sections above. 

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup 
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test 
   traffic into a production network or misroute traffic to the test 
   management network. 

   There are no specific security considerations within the scope of 
   this document. 

    

8. IANA Considerations 

   There are no considerations for IANA at this time.
