Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                   June 2011


1.  Introduction

   The base vCard 4.0 specification [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev] defines
   a large number of properties, including date of birth.  This
   specification adds three new properties to vCard 4.0, for place of
   birth, place of death, and date of death.

1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Syntax specifications shown here use the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234], and are specified as in the base
   vcard specification [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].


2.  Identification Property Extensions

2.1.  Property: BIRTH

   Namespace:

   Property name:  BIRTH

   Purpose:  To specify the place of birth of the object the vCard
       represents.

   Value type:  A single text value (default) or a single URI value.

   Cardinality:  *1

   Property parameters:  VALUE, LANGUAGE

   Description:

   Format definition:
       BIRTH-param =  "VALUE=" / ("text" / "uri")
       BIRTH-value =  text / uri
           ; Value and parameter MUST match.

       BIRTH-param =/  altid-param / language-param / any-param

   Examples:
       BIRTH:Babies'R'Us Hospital
       BIRTH;VALUE=uri:http://example.com/hospitals/babiesrus.vcf
       BIRTH;VALUE=uri:geo:46.769307,-71.283079

2.2.  Property: DEATH

   Namespace:

   Property name:  DEATH

   Purpose:  To specify the place of death of the object the vCard
       represents.

   Value type:  A single text value (default) or a single URI value.

   Cardinality:  *1

   Property parameters:  VALUE, LANGUAGE

   Description:

   Format definition:
       DEATH-param =  "VALUE=" / ("text" / "uri")
       DEATH-value =  text / uri
           ; Value and parameter MUST match.

       DEATH-param =/  altid-param / language-param / any-param

   Examples:
       DEATH:Aboard the Titanic\, near Newfoundland
       DEATH;VALUE=uri:http://example.com/ships/titanic.vcf
       DEATH;VALUE=uri:41.731944,-49.945833

2.3.  Property: DDAY

   Namespace:

   Property name:  DDAY

   Purpose:  To specify the date of death of the object the vCard
       represents.

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                   June 2011


   Cardinality:  *1

   Property parameters:  VALUE, CALSCALE, LANGUAGE
       CALSCALE can only be present when the value is a
       date-and-or-time value and actually contains a date or date-time.
       LANGUAGE can only be present when the value is text.

   Description:

   Format definition:
       DDAY-param =  DDAY-param-date / DDAY-param-text
       DDAY-value =  date-and-or-time / text
           ; Value and parameter MUST match.

       DDAY-param-date =  "VALUE=date-and-or-time"
       DDAY-param-text =  "VALUE=text" / language-param

       DDAY-param =/  altid-param / calscale-param / any-param
           ; calscale-param can only be present when DDAY-value is
           ; date-and-or-time and actually contains a date or date-time.

   Examples:
       DDAY:19960415
       DDAY:--0415
       DDAY;19531015T231000Z
       DDAY;VALUE=text:circa 1800


3.  Security Considerations

   This presents no security considerations beyond those in section 9 of
   the base vcard specification [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].


4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add the following entries to the vCard
   Properties registry, defined in [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev] section
   10.3.1.

         +-----------+--------------+---------+------------------------+
         | Namespace | Property     | Status  | Reference              |
         +-----------+--------------+---------+------------------------+
         |           | BIRTH        | Current | RFCXXXX, section 2.1   |
         |           | DEATH        | Current | RFCXXXX, section 2.2   |
         |           | DDAY         | Current | RFCXXXX, section 2.3   |
         +-----------+--------------+---------+------------------------+
