It has been common for network administrators to filter IP traffic coming 
from unallocated IPv4 address space. Now that there are no longer any 
unallocated IPv4 /8s, this practise is more complicated, fragile and 
expensive. Network administrators are advised to remove filters 
based on the registration status of the address space.

</t>

<t>

This document explains why any remaining filters for unallocated IPv4 /8s 
should now be removed on border routers and documents those IPv4 unicast 
prefixes that should not be routed across the public Internet.

<t>
         
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

<section title="Traffic Filtering Options">

<section title="No Longer Filtering Based on Address Registration Status">

<t>

Network administrators who implemented filters for unallocated IPv4 /8s
did so in the knowledge that those /8s were not a legitimate source of 
traffic on the Internet and that there was a small number of filters
to implement. Now that there are no longer any unallocated unicast IPv4 
/8s, there will be legitimate Internet traffic coming from all unicast /8s 
that are not reserved for special purposes in an RFC.

</t>

<t>

Removing ingress filters based on the registration status of the IPv4 address 
is a simple approach that will avoid blocking legitimate Internet traffic.
   
</t>
   
</section>

<section title="Continuing to Filter Traffic from Unallocated IPv4 Space">

<t>
      
Some network administrators might want to continue filtering unallocated IPv4 
addresses managed by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). This requires 
significantly more granular ingress filters and the highly dynamic nature of 
the RIRs' address pools means that filters need to be updated on a daily basis 
to avoid blocking legitimate incoming traffic.
      
</t>

<section title="Prefixes That Should Not be Routed Across the Internet">

<t> 
   
Network operators who only wish to filter traffic originating from addresses that
should never be routed across the Internet can deploy a set of ingress filters 
designed to block traffic from address blocks reserved for special purposes. These 
are:

   <list>
      
      <t> - 0.0.0.0/8 (Local identification) <xref target="RFC1122"/>;</t>
      <t> - 10.0.0.0/8 (Private use) <xref target="RFC1918"/>;</t>
      <t> - 127.0.0.0/8 (Loopback) <xref target="RFC1122"/>; </t>
      <t> - 169.254.0.0/16 (Link local) <xref target="RFC3927"/>; </t>
      <t> - 172.16.0.0/12 (Private use) <xref target="RFC1918"/>;</t>
      <t> - 192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET-1) <xref target="RFC5737"/>; </t>
      <t> - 192.168.0.0/16 (Private use) <xref target="RFC1918"/>; </t>
      <t> - 198.18.0.0/15 (Benchmark testing) <xref target="RFC2544"/>;</t>
      <t> - 198.51.100.0/24 (TEST-NET-2) <xref target="RFC5737"/>;</t>
      <t> - 203.0.113.0/24 (TEST-NET-3) <xref target="RFC5737"/>;</t>
      <t> - 224.0.0.0/4 (Multicast) <xref target="RFC5771"/>; and</t>
      <t> - 240.0.0.0/4 (Future use) <xref target="RFC1112"/>.</t>
   </list>
   
</t>

<t>
   
A full set of special use IPv4 addresses can be found in <xref target="RFC5735"/>. It
includes prefixes that are intended for Internet use.
   
</t>

</section>
   
<section title='Security Considerations'>

   <t>
      
The cessation of filters based on unallocated IPv4 /8 allocations is an
evolutionary step towards reasonable security filters.  While these
filters are no longer necessary, and in fact harmful, this does not
obviate the need to continue other security solutions.  These other
solutions are as necessary today as they ever were.
