    <t>
    This document specifies the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), a specialized RESTful transfer protocol for use with constrained networks and nodes for machine-to-machine applications such as smart energy and building automation. These constrained nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. 
    CoAP provides the REST Method/Response interaction model between application end-points, supports built-in resource discovery, and includes key web concepts such as URIs and content-types. CoAP easily translates to HTTP for integration with the web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead and simplicity for constrained environments.

  <section anchor='introduction' title="Introduction">

  <t>
  The use of web services on the Internet has become ubiquitous in most applications, and depends on the fundamental Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture of the web. 
  </t>
  <t>
  The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) working group aims at realizing the REST architecture in a suitable form for the most constrained nodes (e.g. 8-bit microcontrollers with limited RAM and ROM) and networks (e.g. 6LoWPAN). Constrained networks like 6LoWPAN support the expensive fragmentation of IPv6 packets into small link-layer frames. One design goal of CoRE has been to keep message overhead small, thus limiting the use of fragmentation.  
  </t>
  <t>One of the main goals of CoRE is to design a generic RESTful protocol for the special requirements of this constrained environment, especially considering energy, building automation and other M2M applications. The goal of CoAP is not to blindly compress HTTP, but rather to realize a subset of REST common with HTTP but optimized for M2M applications. Although CoRE could be used for compressing simple HTTP interfaces, it more importantly also offers features for M2M such as built-in discovery, multicast support and asynchronous transactions.
  </t>
  <t>
  This document specifies the RESTful Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) , which easily translates to HTTP for integration with the existing web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead and simplicity for constrained environments and M2M applications <xref target="I-D.shelby-core-coap-req"/>. CoAP has the following main features:

  <list style="symbols">
    <t>Constrained RESTful protocol fulfilling M2M requirements.</t>
    <t>A stateless HTTP mapping, allowing proxies to be built providing access to CoAP resources via HTTP in a uniform way or for HTTP simple interfaces to be realized alternatively over CoAP.</t>
    <t>UDP binding with reliable unicast and best-effort multicast support.</t>
    <t>Asynchronous transaction support.</t>
    <t>Low header overhead and parsing complexity.</t>
    <t>URI and Content-type support.</t>

  <section anchor='protocol' title="Constrained Application Protocol">

  <t>
  This section specifies the basic functionality and processing rules of the protocol. 
  </t>

    <section anchor='interaction' title="Interaction Model">

    <t>
    The REST interaction model of CoAP is similar to the client/server model of HTTP. However, Machine-to-machine interactions typically result in a CoAP implementation acting in both client and server roles (called an end-point). A CoAP REST exchange is equivalent to that of HTTP, and is sent by a client to request an action (using a Method Code) on a resource (identified by a URI) on a server. A response is then sent with a Response Code and resource representation if appropriate. </t>
    
	<t>
	Unlike HTTP, CoAP deals with these REST interchanges asynchronously over a UDP transport with support for both unicast and multicast interactions. This is achieved using transaction messages (Confirmable, Non-Confirmable, Acknowledgment, Reset) supporting optional reliability (with exponential back-off) and transaction IDs between end-points to carry REST requests and responses. These transactions are transparent to the REST interchanges. The only difference being that responses may arrive asynchronously. 
	</t>
	<t>
	One could think of CoAP as using a two-layer approach, a transactional layer used to deal with UDP and the asynchronous nature of the interactions, and the REST interactions using Method and Response codes. 
	</t>

<section anchor="synchronous-response" title="Synchronous response">

<t>The most basic interaction between the REST and Transaction layers works by
sending a REST request in a confirmable CoAP message and waiting for
an acknowledgment message that also carries the REST response.
E.g., two possible interactions for a basic GET are shown in <xref target="get-basic"/>.</t>

<figure anchor="get-basic" title="Two basic GET transactions, one successful, one not found"><artwork><![CDATA[
Client             Server       Client             Server
   |                 |             |                 |
   |    CON tid=47   |             |    CON tid=53   |
   |     GET /foo    |             |     GET /baz    |
   +---------------->|             +---------------->|
   |                 |             |                 |
   |    ACK tid=47   |             |    ACK tid=53   |
   |  200 "<temp...  |             |    404 "Not...  |
   |<----------------+             |<----------------+
   |                 |             |                 |
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Note that at the transaction layer, the response is returned in an ACK
message, independent of whether the request was successful at the REST layer.
In effect, the REST response is piggy-backed on the ACK message, so no
separate acknowledgment is required that the GET message was received.</t>

<t>The relationship between the confirmable message (CON) and the
acknowledgment message (ACK) is indicated by the transaction ID,
which is echoed back by the server in the ACK.
Transaction IDs are short-lived, they only serve to couple CON and ACK
messages.</t>

<t>The tight coupling between CON and ACK also relieves the ACK of the
need to echo back information from the request, such as the URI or a
request token supplied by the client.  We say that a REST response
carried in an ACK <spanx style='emph'>pertains</spanx> to the REST request in the corresponding
CON.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="asynchronous-response" title="Asynchronous response">

<t>Not all interactions are as simple as the basic synchronous exchange
shown.  For example, a server might need longer to obtain the
representation of the resource requested than it can wait sending back
the acknowledgment, without risking the client to repeatedly
retransmit the request.  To handle this case, the REST response is
decoupled from the transaction layer acknowledgment.  Actually, the
latter does not carry any REST message at all.</t>

<t>As the client cannot know that this will be the case, it sends exactly
the same confirmable message with the same REST request.  The server
maybe attempts to obtain the resource (e.g., by acting as a proxy) and
times out an ACK timer, or it immediately sends an acknowledgment
knowing in advance that there will be no quick answer.  The
acknowledgment effectively is a promise that the REST request will be
acted upon, see <xref target="get-async"/>.</t>

<figure anchor="get-async" title="An asynchronous GET transaction"><artwork><![CDATA[
Client             Server
   |                 |
   |   CON tid=48    |
   |  GET http://n.. |
   +---------------->|
   |                 |
   |   ACK tid=48    |

   |   ACK tid=783   |
   +---------------->|
   |                 |
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>When the server finally has obtained the resource representation and
is ready to send the response, it initiates a transaction to the
client.  This new transaction has its own transaction ID, so there is
no automatic coupling of the response to the request.  Instead, the
URI (and possibly token) is echoed back to the client in order to
associate the REST response to the original REST request.
To ensure that this message is not lost, it is again sent as a
confirmable message and answered by the client with an ACK, citing the
new TID chosen by the server.</t>

<t>As a special failure situation, a client may no longer be aware that
it sent a request, e.g., if it does not have stable storage and was
rebooted in the meantime.  This can be indicated by a special "Reset"
message, as shown in <xref target="get-orphaned"/>.</t>

	<section anchor='transactions' title="Transaction messages">
	
	<t>The CoAP transactions make use of four different message types, described in this section. These messages are transparent to the REST request/response carried over them.</t>
	
	  <section anchor='confirmable' title="Confirmable (CON)">
		<t>
		Some messages require an acknowledgment, either just to know they did
arrive or also to deliver the reply to a request.  We call these
messages "Confirmable".  When no packets are lost, each Confirmable
message elicits exactly one return message of type Acknowledgment or
type Reset.
		</t>
	  </section>

	  <section anchor='non-confirmable' title="Non-Confirmable (NON)">
		<t>
		Some other messages do not require an acknowledgment. This is
particularly true for messages that are repeated regularly for
application requirements, such as repeated readings from a sensor
where eventual arrival is sufficient.
		</t>
	  </section>
	  
	  <section anchor='acknowledgment' title="Acknowledgment (ACK)">
		<t>
		An Acknowledgment message acknowledges that a specific Confirmable
message (identified by its Transaction ID) arrived.  As with all of
the message types itself, it may carry a payload and some options to
provide more details, such as the result of a request that was carried
in the Confirmable.
		</t>
	  </section>	  

	  <section anchor='reset' title="Reset (RST)">
		<t>
		A Reset message indicates that a specific Confirmable message was
received, but some context is missing to properly process it.  This
condition is usually caused when the receiving node has rebooted and has
forgotten some state that would be required to interpret the message.
		</t>
	  </section>

      <section anchor='transactionid' title="Transaction IDs">

      <t>
      The Transaction ID is an unsigned integer kept by a CoAP end-point for all of the CoAP Confirmable or Non-Confirmable messages it sends. Each CoAP end-point keeps a single Transaction ID variable, which is changed each time a new Confirmable or Non-Confirmable message is sent regardless of the destination address or port. The Transaction ID is used to match an Acknowledgment with an outstanding request, for retransmission and to discard duplicate messages. The initial Transaction ID should be randomized. The same Transaction ID MUST NOT be re-used within the potential retransmission window, calculated as RESPONSE_TIMEOUT * (2 ^ MAX_RETRANSMIT - 1).
      </t>
      
<!-- TODO: This specification does not work for a large client interacting with thousands of servers. (Carsten) -->

      </section>

	</section>


    <section anchor='methods' title="Methods">
    <t>
    CoAP supports the basic RESTful methods of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, which are easily mapped to HTTP. In this section each method is defined along with its behavior. A unicast request with an unknown or unsupported Method Code MUST generate a message with a "405 Method Not Allowed" Response Code.
    </t>
    <t>
    As CoAP methods manipulate resources, they have the same properties of safe (only retrieval) and idempotent (you can invoke it multiple times with the same effects) as HTTP <xref target="RFC2616">Section 9.1</xref>. The GET method is safe, therefore it MUST NOT take any other action on a resource other than retrieval. The GET, PUT and DELETE methods MUST be performed in such a way that they are idempotent.
    </t>

      <section anchor='read' title="GET">
      <t>
      The GET method retrieves the information of the resource identified by the request URI. Upon success a 200 (OK) response SHOULD be sent.
      </t>
      <t>
      The response to a GET is cacheable if it meets the requirements in <xref target="caching"/>.
      </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor='create' title="POST">
      <t>
      The POST method is used to request the server to create a new resource under the requested URI. If a resource has been created on the server, the response SHOULD be 201 (Created) including the URI of the new resource in a Location Option with any possible status in the message body. If the POST succeeds but does not result in a new resource being created on the server, a 200 (OK) response code SHOULD be returned. 
      </t>  
      <t>
      Responses to this method are not cacheable.
      </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor='update' title="PUT">
      <t>
      The PUT method requests that the resource identified by the request URI be updated with the enclosed message body. If a resource exists at that URI the message body SHOULD be considered a modified version of that resource, and a 200 (OK) response SHOULD be returned. If no resource exists then the server MAY create a new resource with that URI, resulting in a 201 (Created) response. If the resource could not be created or modified, then an appropriate error response code SHOULD be sent.
      </t>
      <t>
      Responses to this method are not cacheable.
      </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor='delete' title="DELETE">
      <t>
      The DELETE method requests that the resource identified by the request URI be deleted. The response 200 (OK) SHOULD be sent on success.
      </t>
      <t>
      Responses to this method are not cacheable.
      </t>
      </section>

<!-- Carsten: The idempotence then requires that deleting a non-existing resource also returns a 200? -->

    </section>


    <section title="Response Codes">

    <t>
    CoAP makes use of a subset of HTTP response codes as defined in <xref target="appendix_codes"/>.
    </t>

    </section>


    <section anchor='opt' title="Options">
	  <t>
	  CoAP makes use of compact, extensible Type-Length-Value (TLV) style options. This section explains the processing of CoAP options along with a summary of the main features implemented in options such as URIs and Content-types.  
	  </t>
	

    <section anchor='opt-proc' title="Option Processing">
      <t>
      If no options are to be included, the Option Count field is set to 0 below and the Payload (if any) immediately follows the Transaction ID. If options are to be included, the following rules apply. The number of options is placed in the Option Count field. Each option is then placed in order of Type, immediately following the Transaction ID with no padding. Upon reception, unknown options of class "elective" MUST be silently skipped.

    <section anchor='uri' title="URIs">
    <t>
    The Universal Resource Identifier (URI) <xref target="RFC3986"/> is an important feature of the REST architecture, where the relative part of the URI indicates the resource being manipulated. CoAP supports URIs similarly to HTTP, e.g. coap://[2001:DB8::101]/s/temp. As this URI is used purely as a locator, CoAP only supports Universal Resource Locator features of <xref target="RFC3986"/> although throughout the document we refer to URI. 
    </t>
    <t>
    CoAP splits the URI up into its three parts with the Uri-Scheme, Uri-Authority and Uri-Path Options. The full URI can be created by concatenating those options (or their defaults if not present). Uri-Scheme and Uri-Authority options are used for proxying, whereas Uri-Path is used for all requests. CoAP does not support "." or ".." in URIs nor does it support IRIs. A CoAP implementation SHOULD support query "?" processing  (see <xref target="discovery"/> on the use of the query string in discovery), however fragment "#" processing is not supported. All URI strings in CoAP MUST use the US-ASCII encoding defined in <xref target="RFC3986"/>. When using the Uri-Path Option the leading slash MUST be omitted. Thus the above example "/s/temp" is included in the Uri-Path Option as "s/temp". 
    </t>
    <t>
    Application designers are encouraged to make use of short, but descriptive URIs. For example URIs 14 or less bytes in length fit in a more compact option header. In addition, very short URIs such as "/1" can be assigned as an alternative short URI for a resource by the application. CoAP resource descriptions includes an attribute to indicate if a short alternative URI of a resource is available (see <xref target="discovery"/>).
    </t>
    <t>
    The CoAP protocol scheme is identified in URIs with "coap://" [IANA_TBD_SCHEME].
    </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor='content-type' title="Content-type encoding">

    <t>
    In order to support heterogeneous uses, CoAP is transparent to the use of different application payloads. In order for the application process receiving a packet to properly parse a payload, its content-type should be explicitly known from the header (as e.g. with HTTP). The use of typical binary encodings for XML is discussed in <xref target="I-D.shelby-6lowapp-encoding"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
    String names of Internet media types (MIME types) <xref target="RFC2046"/> are not optimal for use in the CoAP header. Instead, CoAP simply assigns identifiers to a subset of common media and content transfer encoding types. The content-type identifier is optionally included in the Content-type Option Header of messages to indicate the type of the message body. CoAP Content-type identifiers are defined in <xref target="appendix_content"/>. In the absence of the Content-type Option the MIME type "text/plain" MUST BE assumed.

In SI units, these are measured in seconds.
CoAP durations represent integer numbers of seconds, but instead of
representing these numbers as integers, a more compact single-byte
pseudo-floating-point (pseudo-FP) representation is used (<xref target="pseudofp"/>).</t>

bit) is the decoded value.  If the high bit is set, the mantissa
(including the high bit, but with the exponent field cleared out) is
shifted left by the exponent to yield the decoded value.</t>

<t>The (n,e)-pseudo-FP format can be decoded with a single line of code

  <section anchor='binding' title="UDP Binding">

  <t>
  The CoAP protocol operates by default over UDP. CoAP could also be used over other transports such as TCP or SCTP, the specification of which is out of this document's scope.
  </t>
  
    <t>
    The goal of binding CoAP to UDP is to provide the bare minimum features for the protocol to operate over UDP, without trying to re-create the full feature set of a transport like TCP. CoAP over UDP has the following features:
    </t>
    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Simple stop-and-wait retransmission reliability with exponential back-off as described in <xref target="retransmission"/> for Confirmable messages.</t>
        <t>Transaction ID for response matching as described in <xref target="transactionid"/>.</t>
        <t>Multicast support as described in <xref target="multicast"/>.  </t>
      </list>
    </t>

    <t>
   The length of the Payload in a CoAP message is calculated from the datagram length. While specific link layers make it beneficial to keep CoAP messages small enough to fit into their link layer packets (see <xref target="introduction"/>), this is a matter of implementation quality.  The CoAP specification itself provides only an upper bound to the message size. A CoAP message SHOULD fit within a single IP packet and MUST fit within a single IP datagram. If the Path MTU is not known for a destination, an MTU of 1280 octets SHOULD be assumed.
    </t>  
 
 <section anchor='multicast' title="Multicast">
 	<t>
 	CoAP supports the use of multicast destination addresses. Multicast messages SHOULD be Non-Confirmable. If a Confirmable multicast message is sent then retransmission MUST NOT be performed. Furthermore, a destination end-point to a multicast Confirmable message MUST only send an Acknowledgment if the response code included indicates success (Code = 2XX) in order to eliminate error code response floods. Other mechanisms for avoiding congestion from multicast requests are being considered in <xref target="I-D.eggert-core-congestion-control"/>.

</section>
 
 
 <section anchor='retransmission' title="Retransmission">
      <t>
      A CoAP end-point keeps track of open Confirmable messages it sent that are waiting for a response. Each entry includes at least the destination IP address and port of the original message, the message itself, a retransmission counter and a timeout. When a Confirmable is sent, an entry is made for that message with a default initial timeout of RESPONSE_TIMEOUT and the retransmission counter set to 0. When a matching Acknowledgment is received for an entry, the entry is invalidated. When a timeout is triggered for an entry and the retransmission counter is less than MAX_RETRANSMIT, the original message is retransmitted to the destination without modification, the retransmission counter is incremented, and the timeout is doubled. If the retransmission counter reaches MAX_RETRANSMIT on a timeout, then the entry is removed and the application process informed of delivery failure.
      </t>
      <t>
      For CoAP messages sent to IP multicast addresses, retransmission MUST NOT be performed. Therefore MAX_RETRANSMIT is always set to 0 when the destination address is multicast.
      </t>
      </section>

  <section anchor='congenstion' title="Congestion Control">
      <t>
      In addition to the exponential back-off mechanism in <xref target="retransmission"/>, further congestion control optimizations are being considered and tested for CoAP. These congestion control mechanism under consideration are described in <xref target="I-D.eggert-core-congestion-control"/>.
      </t>
  </section>	

    <section anchor='port' title="Default Port">
    <t>
    The CoAP default port number [IANA_TBD_PORT] MUST be supported by a server for resource discovery (see <xref target="discovery"/>) and SHOULD be supported for providing access to other resources. In addition other end-points may be hosted in the dynamic port space.
    </t>
    <t>
    When a CoAP server is hosted by a 6LoWPAN node, it SHOULD support a port in the 61616-61631 compressed UDP port space defined in <xref target="RFC4944"/>. The specific port number in use will be communicated in a URI and/or by some other discovery mechanism.

  <section anchor='caching' title="Caching">

  <t>
  CoAP end-points are by definition constrained by bandwidth and processing power. To optimize the performance of data transfer under these constraints, we use caching features consistent with HTTP.  Caching includes the following concepts:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>Cache life of a resource is controlled via the Max-Age header option</t>
      <t>Cache refresh and versioning of a resource is controlled via the Etag header option</t>
      <t>Proxies between a client and end-point may participate in the caching process on behalf of sleeping end-points and to avoid unnecessary traffic on the constrained network</t>
    </list>
  </t>

    <section anchor='cache-control' title="Cache control">
    <t>
    When an end-point responds to a GET request by sending a representation of the resource, it SHOULD specify the Max-Age header option.  The Max-Age specifies the cache life of the resource in seconds.  Resources which change rapidly will have a short cache life, and resources which change infrequently should specify a long cache life.  If Max-Age is unspecified in a GET response, then it is assumed to be 60 seconds.  If an end-point wishes to disable caching, it must explicitly specify a Max-Age of zero seconds.
    </t>

    <t>
    When a client reads the response from a GET request, it should cache the resource representation for the cache lifetime as specified by the Max-Age header.  During the cache lifetime, the client SHOULD use its cached version and avoid performing additional GETs for the resource.
    </t>

    <t>
    In general, the origin server end-point is responsible for determining cache age. However, in some cases a client may wish to determine its own tolerance for cache staleness.  In this case, a client may specify the Max-Age header during a GET request.  If the client's Max-Age is of a shorter duration than the age of a cached resource, then the proxy or end-point SHOULD perform a cache refresh.  If the client specifies a Max-Age of zero seconds, then the response MUST discard the cached representation and return a fresh representation.

    <section anchor='cache-refreshing' title="Cache refresh">
    <t>
    After the expiration of the cache lifetime, clients and proxies can refresh their cached representation of a resource.  Cache refresh is accomplished using a GET request which will return a representation of the resource's current state.
    </t>

    <t>
    If the end-point has the capability to version the resource, then the end-point should include the Etag header option in the response to a GET request.  The Etag is a variable length sequence of bytes which captures a version identifier of the resource.  The Etag is an opaque identifier; clients MUST NOT infer any semantics from the Etag value.
    </t>

    <t>
    If an end-point specifies the Etag header option with a response, then the client SHOULD specify a matching Etag header option in their GET request during cache refresh.  If the end-point's version of the resource is unmodified, then the server SHOULD return a 304 response with no payload to avoid retransmitting the resource representation.
    </t>

    <section anchor='proxying' title="Proxying">

    <t>
	A proxy is defined as a CoAP end-point which services cached requests on behalf of other CoAP end-points.  Any node in a CoAP network may act as a proxy, although in general the node between the constrained network and the Internet at large SHOULD always support proxy functionality.
	</t>

	<t>
	Proxies should be used under the following scenarios:
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>Clients external to the constrained network SHOULD always make requests through a proxy to limit traffic on the constrained network</t>

	  <t>Clients internal to the constrained network MAY use a proxy based on network topology when performance warrants</t>

	  <t>Clients of sleeping devices MUST use a proxy to access resources while the device is sleeping</t>

<!-- Carsten: How do they find out?
We would need a "coapsleeper" scheme or some such.
(And how do they find the right proxy?  Which might change...) -->	  
	  
	</list>  
	</t>

	<t>
	Proxy requests are made as normal CON requests to the proxy end-point. All proxy requests MUST use the Uri-Authority header to indicate the origin server's IP address using the URI format defined by RFC 3986:
	</t>

       <figure>
         <artwork><![CDATA[

  full uri  = "coap://" + authority + path
  authority = host [ ":" port ]
  host      = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name 
              (as defined by RFC 3986)
  port      = *DIGIT

         ]]></artwork>
       </figure>

	<t>
	The host part is case insensitive and may be an IPv4 literal, IPv6 literal in square brackets, or a registered name.  The port number is optional, if omitted or zero-length it is assumed to be the default CoAP port (see <xref target="port"/>).  
	</t>

	<t>If a request is made using the Uri-Authority header, then the following steps are taken:
	<list>

  	<t>1.  If the authority (host and port) is the same as the proxy end-point, then the request MUST be treated as a local request and the path part is used as Uri-Path</t>

  	<t>2.  If the end-point does not support proxy functionality for the given URI or Method code, then the 400 Bad Request (TBD) error code MUST be returned</t>

 	<t>3.  If the proxy does not contain a fresh cached representation of the resource, then the proxy MUST attempt to refresh its cache according to section 5.2.  The origin server's IP address and port is determined by the authority part of the full URI.  The Uri-Path option for the refresh request is determined by the path part of the full URI.</t>

  	<t>4.  If the proxy fails to obtain a fresh cached representation, then a 502 Bad Gateway error code MUST be returned</t>

  	<t>5.  The proxy returns the cached representation on behalf of the origin server</t>
  	
	</list>
	</t>
	
	<t>
	All CoAP options are considered end-to-end and MUST be stored as part of the cache entry and MUST be transmitted in the proxy's response.  The Max-Age option should be adjusted by the proxy for each response using the formula: <![CDATA[proxy-max-age = original-max-age - cache-age]]>. For example if a request is made to a proxied resource that was refreshed 20sec ago and had an original Max-Age of 60sec, then that resource's proxied Max-Age is now 40sec.

  <section anchor='discovery' title="Resource Discovery">

  <t>
  The discovery of resources offered by a CoAP end-point is extremely important in machine-to-machine applications where there are no humans in the loop and static interfaces result in fragility. The discovery of resources provided by an HTTP Web Server is typically called Web Discovery. In this document we refer to the discovery of resources offered by a CoAP end-point as resource discovery. CoAP resource discovery enables both unicast and multicast discovery of resources including filtering on attributes of resource descriptions. CoAP resource discovery can also be used to discovery HTTP resources. 
  </t>
  <t>
  CoAP makes the assumption that all CoAP servers host an end-point on the default CoAP port (see <xref target="port"/>) hosting a well-known discovery resource, or otherwise have been configured or discovered using some general service discovery mechanism such as <xref target="I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd"/>. This section assumes that such a configuration or service discovery has already been performed a priori, if needed.
  </t>
  <t>
  Resource discovery in CoAP is accomplished through the use of well-known resources which describe the links (resource descriptions) offered by that CoAP server. Well-known resources use the URI form "/.well-known/" as specified in <xref target="RFC5785"/>.  CoAP discovery defines a new well-known URI for discovery "/.well-known/r" [IANA_TBD_WELLKNOWN]. A CoAP end-point MUST support this URI for the purpose of resource discovery. It is however up to the application which resources descriptions are included and how they are organized. The resource representation of this resource is described in <xref target="link_format"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
  CoAP Resource Discovery supports the following interactions:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>[GET /.well-known/r] returns a list of links available from a CoAP server (if any). This request may be unicast or multicast.</t>
      
      <t>Filtering may be performed on any of the resource description attributes using a query string as specified in <xref target="discovery_filtering"/>. For example [GET /.well-known/r?n=Temperature] would return resources with the name Temperature.
      </t>
      
      <t>More capable end-points such as proxies could support a resource directory by requesting the resource descriptions of other end-points or accepting [POST /.well-known/r] messages from other CoAP end-points. This adds the resources of other end-points to a resource directory in which absolute URIs are included for the links. The details of such an entity are however out of scope for this document.</t>
      
      <t>CoAP may also be used to discovery HTTP resources or an HTTP server may use the well-known resource and link-format as discussed in <xref target="discovry_http"/>. </t>
    </list>
  </t>
  <t>
  End-points with a large number of resources SHOULD include resource descriptions only for important collections and organize their resource descriptions into a hierarchy of link resources. This is done by including links in the /.well-known/r list which point to other resource lists, e.g. <![CDATA["</.well-known/r/s>;n=Sensors;ct=40"]]>. Such a hierarchy SHOULD be under the /.well-known/r path.
  </t>
   
    <section anchor='link_format' title="Link Format">

    <t>
    CoAP resource discovery makes use of the HTTP Link Header format specified in <xref target="I-D.nottingham-http-link-header"/> which is in Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation <xref target="RFC5234"/>. This specification allows for the use of this simple link format by other protocols, thus not limiting it to the actual HTTP Link Header. The format does not require special XML or binary parsing, and is extensible. The format is also compatible with the naming and descriptions used in <xref target="I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd"/>. 
    </t>
    <t>
    <xref target="I-D.nottingham-http-link-header"/> did not request a MIME type for this link format, as it assumes that would usually be carried in an HTTP header. This specification thus requests a MIME type for this header as in <xref target="appendix_content"/> [IANA_TBD_LINK].
    </t>
    <t>
    The CoAP link-format defines default attributes for CoAP resource discovery. All link parameters are optional and custom link-extensions MAY be defined.  Multiple descriptions are separated by commas as in <xref target="I-D.nottingham-http-link-header"/>. The following ABNF specification defines the format:

<section anchor='discovery_naming' title="Naming">

	<t>
	CoAP resource naming is designed to be compatible with DNS-based Service Discovery naming. The n= attribute carries what can be considered the "Instance" part of a DNS-SD name. The "Service" and "Domain" parts of DNS naming are implied as Service is assumed to be "_coap._udp" and Domain is assumed to be .local. The Service part MAY be included as _http._tcp in the case of an HTTP resource. The Domain MAY be included if different than .local.
	</t>
	
	<t>Whereas service discovery is used to find the IP address, port and protocol of an unknown service, resource discovery is a fine-grained discovery of resource URIs within a web service. CoAP resource descriptions can be imported into DNS-SD for exposure to service discovery by using the n= attribute as the "Instance", "_coap_udp" as the Service and a default of ".local" as the Domain. The DNS TXT record can be generated by importing the resource description attributes as they share the same format as Section 6 of <xref target="I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd"/>. 
	</t>

</section>

<section anchor='discovery_filtering' title="Query Filtering">
	<t>
	A CoAP end-point SHOULD support the query string /.well-known/r? with uri= or any of the resource description attributes for the purpose of filtering a discovery. Wildcard * endings SHOULD be supported. An exact match is performed on the query string, and a 200 OK response is returned with a link-style structure that contains the matching entries (if any). If resource descriptions are organized hierarchically, a query on the root resource /.well-known/r SHOULD return all matching resource descriptions from the entire hierarchy if possible.
	</t>
	<t>
	For a unicast query with no matching entries a 404 Not Found code is returned, however no response is sent in case of a multicast query as described in <xref target="multicast"/> to prevent a flood of responses.	
	</t>
	
</section>
  
<section anchor='discovry_http' title="HTTP Resource Discovery">
	<t>
	This mechanism may also be used to discover HTTP resources as HTTP lacks a built-in discovery mechanism and multicast support. When HTTP resources are listed in the link-format HTTP they SHOULD be indicated by including http:// in the link-value field or the _http._tcp Service in the name attribute. 
	</t>	
	<t>
	An HTTP server may make use of the /.well-known/r URI scheme and link-format representation defined in this section for the purpose of discovery using HTTP. This may especially be useful for a CoAP-HTTP proxy to expose the resources available in a constrained domain to HTTP clients.

  <section anchor='http' title="HTTP Mapping">
	
  <t>
  CoAP supports a limited subset of HTTP functionality, and thus a mapping to HTTP is straightforward. There might be several reasons for mapping between CoAP and HTTP, for example when designing a REST interface for use over either protocol or when realizing a CoAP-HTTP proxy. Likewise, CoAP could equally be mapped to other protocols such as XMPP or SIP, the definition of which is out of scope. 
  </t>

  <t>
  The mapping of CoAP to HTTP is a straightforward conversion of the CoAP method or response code, content-type and options to the corresponding HTTP feature. The payload is carried in an equivalent way by both protocols. The mapping of HTTP to CoAP requires checking for methods, response codes, options and content-types that are not supported by CoAP. A mapping SHOULD attempt to map options, response codes and content-types to a suitable alternative if possible. Otherwise the unsupported feature SHOULD be silently dropped if possible, or an appropriate error code generated otherwise.
  </t>

  <t>
  The caching and proxying of CoAP is specified in <xref target="caching"/>. In a similar manner, caching and proxying MAY be performed between CoAP and HTTP by an intermediate node. A proxy SHOULD respond with a 502 (Bad Gateway) error to HTTP requests which can not be successfully mapped to CoAP. CoAP transaction messages are transparent to REST and MUST have no affect on a proxy function.

Servers A and B have a matching resource, therefore they send back a successful 200 OK response with the matching resource in the payload. C does not attempt to send a response.</t>

  <section title="Security Considerations">
         <t> 
         TODO: Expand this section to a full security analysis, including how to use CoAP with various security options.
         </t>
         <t>
         Some of the features considered in this document will need further security considerations during a protocol design. For example the use of string URLs may have entail security risks due to complex processing on limited microcontroller implementations.
         </t>
         <t>
     	 The CoAP protocol will be designed for use with e.g. (D)TLS, IPsec or object security. A protocol design should consider how integration with these security methods will be done, how to secure the CoAP header and other implications.

         [IANA_TBD_SCHEME] This document suggests the scheme coap:// to identify this protocol in a URI. The string "coap" should similarly be used in well-known port and service discovery registrations.
        </t>
        <t>
         [IANA_TBD_PORT] Apply for a well-known port number in the 0-1023 space as CoAP end-points are usually executed by an operating system or root process. http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers

     	<t>
     	 [IANA_TBD_MIME] A new registry is required for the Internet MIME type identifier space for CoAP as described in <xref target="appendix_content"/>.

<section anchor="appendix_content" title="Content Types">

  <t>
  Internet media types are identified by a string in HTTP, such as "application/xml". This string is made up of a top-level type "application" and a sub-type "xml" <xref target="RFC2046"/>. In order to minimize the overhead of using these media types to indicate the type of message payload, CoAP defines an identifier encoding scheme for a subset of Internet media types. It is expected that this table of identifiers will be extensible and maintained by IANA for values of 0-200 [IANA_TBD_MIME].
  </t>
  <t>
  The Content-type Option is formatted as an 8-bit unsigned integer. Initial mappings from Internet media types to a suitable identifier is shown in <xref target="tab-mediatype"/>. Composite high-level types (multipart and message) are not supported. Identifier values from 201-255 are reserved for vendor specific, application specific or experimental use and are not maintained by IANA.
