INTERNET DRAFT                    EUDP                  January 30, 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document is a specification of experimental Extendable User
   Datagram Protocol (EUDP), which is based on User Datagram Protocol
   (UDP), but allows to extend its header and, therefore, its
   functionality with options.

   Such solution may be useful in the situations when UDP provides lack
   of features while other transport-layer protocols, such as
   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [RFC793] or Datagram Congestion
   Control Protocol (DCCP) [RFC4340], have excessive facilities, which
   might not be needed in such particular case.  Current transport-layer
   protocols are not able to cope with such situations.  Unlike them,
   EUDP may provide theoretically unlimited number of features, that may
   be appended to core transport facilities, depending on what the
   client wants EUDP to provide.  Therefore, EUDP is intended to be a
   universal solution, that may be used in almost any situation and may
   suit to almost any requirements.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol Description

2.1. Lower Layer Protocols Considerations

   EUDP is a transport-layer protocol.  It is implemented on the top of
   Internet Protocol (IP).  EUDP supports as IPv4 [RFC791], as IPv6
   [RFC2460] as lower-layer protocol.  The IP Protocol number to be used
   with EUDP is TBD1.  Moreover, EUDP SHOULD be able to operate on the
   any protocol that provides the same functionality as IP, such as EIP
   [RFC1385] or TP/IX [RFC1475].

2.2. Packet Format

2.2.1. Header

2.2.2. Fields

   Source Port (16 bits) - REQUIRED field which is defied and is to be
   used as described in UDP specification - RFC 768 [RFC768].  EUDP uses
   the same port set as UDP.

   Destination Port (16 bits) - REQUIRED field which is defied and is to
   be used as described in UDP specification - RFC 768 [RFC768].  EUDP
   uses the same port set as UDP.

   options) MUST be an integral number of 32 bits long.

   Options (variable length) - OPIONAL field, that is used to carry EUDP
   options in.  EUDP option are described in Section 2.3.

   Padding (variable length) - OPTIONAL field.  The EUDP header padding
   is used to ensure that the EUDP header ends and data begins on a 32
   bit boundary.  The padding MUST be composed of zeros.

    NOTE: Bits 48-63 are reserved for future use and MUST be ignored by
    EUDP hosts until their use will be properly specified.

2.3. EUDP Options

2.3.1. Generic Description

   EUDP options are placed into the 'Options' header field.  Options may
   occupy space at the end of the EUDP header and are a multiple of 8
   bits in length.  An option may begin on any octet boundary.  There
   are two cases for the format of an option:

     a) a single octet of option-kind.

     b) an octet of option-kind, an octet of option-length, and the
     actual option-data octets.  The option-length counts the two octets
     of option-kind and option-length as well as the option-data octets.

   Note that the list of options MAY be shorter than the data offset
   field might imply.  The content of the header beyond the 'End Of
   Options List' option MUST be header padding (i.e., zero).

   All options can be _mandatory_ or _elective_ for support.  EUDP nodes
   MUST support all _mandatory_ options.  Support of _elective_ options
   is OPTIONAL.

   Pre-defined options are specified in Section 2.3.2.

2.3.2. Pre-Defined Options

   This section specifies pre-defined EUDP options.

2.3.2.1. 'No Operation' Option

   beginning of a subsequent option on a word boundary.

   The option is _mandatory_ for support.

2.3.2.2. 'End Of Options List' Option

   +--------+
   | Kind=1 |
   +--------+

   This option code indicates the end of the option list.  This might
   not coincide with the end of the EUDP header according to the 'Data
   Offset' header field.  This SHALL be used at the end of all options,
   not the end of each option, and need only be used if the end of the
   options would not otherwise coincide with the end of the EUDP header.

   The option is _mandatory_ for support.

2.3.2.3. 'Echo Request' Option

   +--------+--------+-------//-------+
   | Kind=2 | Length |      Data      |
   +--------+--------+-------//-------+

   The 'Echo Request' option is used to provide the possibility of echo
   debugging using the EUDP.  The option-data octets of option MAY
   consist of arbitrary octets.  The receiver of the packet with this
   option MUST answer with the packet with 'Echo Response' option (see
   Section 2.3.2.4).

   The option is _elective_ for support.

2.3.2.4. 'Echo Response' Option

   +--------+--------+-------//-------+
   | Kind=3 | Length |      Data      |
   +--------+--------+-------//-------+

   The 'Echo Response' option is used to answer the packets with 'Echo
   Request' option.  The packet containing 'Echo Response' option MUST
   be send after receiving any EUDP packet with 'Echo Request' option. 
   The option-data octets of the option MUST be the same as in  'Echo
   Request' option in the received packet.

   The option is _elective_ for support.

2.3.2.5. 'Packet Identifier' Option

   +--------+--------+--------+-------+
   | Kind=4 |Length=4|    Packet ID   |
   +--------+--------+--------+-------+

   The 'Packet Identifier' option is asked to request the acknowledgment
   of the single packet.  The 'Packet ID' field is filled by arbitrary
   bytes by the sender of the packet with this option.  The receiver of
   the packet with 'Packet Identifier' option MUST answer with the
   packet with 'Packet Acknowledgment' option (see Section 2.3.2.6). See
   Section 2.5 for details.

   The option is _elective_ for support.

2.3.2.6. 'Packet Acknowledgment' Option

   +--------+--------+--------+-------+
   | Kind=5 |Length=4| ACK Packet ID  |
   +--------+--------+--------+-------+

   The 'Packet Acknowledgment' option is used to answer the packets with
   'Packet Identifier' option.  The 'ACK Packet ID' field in the option
   in the packet sent to the originating host for packet with 'Packet
   Identifier' option MUST be the same as in received from this host
   packet.  See Section 2.5 for details.

   The option is _elective_ for support.

2.3.2.7. 'Options Negotiation Request' Option 

   +--------+--------+--------+-------//-------+
   | Kind=6 | Length | Opt.#1 | Opt#2 .. Opt#N |
   +--------+--------+--------+-------//-------+

   The 'Options Negotiation Request' option is used to initiate the
   negotiation of use of _elective_ options (see Section 2.3.1).  If the
   EUDP host wants to use one or more _elective_ options, it SHOULD
   firstly negotiate their use with the other host.  The option-data
   octets of the option contain the numbers of options the host wants to
   negotiate.  The EUDP host that receives the packet with this option
   SHALL answer with the packet with 'Options Negotiation Response' (see
   Section 2.3.2.8).  The 'Options Negotiation Request' option MUST
   contain the numbers of _elective_ options only.

   The option is _mandatory_ for support.

2.3.2.8. 'Options Negotiation Response' Option

   +--------+--------+--------+-------//-------+
   | Kind=7 | Length | Opt.#1 | Opt#2 .. Opt#N |
   +--------+--------+--------+-------//-------+

   The 'Options Negotiation Response' option is used to complete the
   _elective_ options negotiation.  Once EUDP host receives the 'Options
   Negotiation Request' option (see Section 2.3.2.7), it SHALL check
   what option from the list mentioned in the negotiation request it
   supports and put appropriate values into the 'Options Negotiation
   Response' option, put it into the EUDP packet and send back.

   The option is _mandatory_ for support.

2.3.2.9. 'Packet Checksum' Option

   +--------+--------+--------+-------+
   | Kind=8 |Length=4|    Checksum    |
   +--------+--------+--------+-------+

   The 'Packet Checksum' option is used to carry packet checksum,
   calculated using the method described in RFC 768 [RFC768].  Packets
   containing this option with bad checksum SHOULD be discarded.

   The option is _elective_ for support.

2.4. Pseudo Header

   EUDP does not use pseudo header.

2.5. Packet Delivery Acknowledgment Mechanism

   EUDP provides the possibility to request the acknowledgment of the
   single EUDP packet.  This is provided by 'Packet Identifier' and
   'Packet Acknowledgment' options.  In the simplest form, the delivery
   acknowledgment mechanism works as below.

   If EUDP host (let it be A) wants to request the acknowledgment of
   delivery of some packet, it puts the 'Packet Identifier' option in it
   and sends this packet to another EUDP host (let it be B).  Once B
   receives the A's packet, it checks the 'Packet Identifier' option to
   find out the packet identifier.  After it finds it out, this number
   becomes the 'ACK Packet Identifier', that is put into 'Packet
   Acknowledgment' option, which is put into the EUDP packet, and sent
   to A.  The packet identifiers MAY be reused once they are
   acknowledged, since EUDP does provides stateless connection.

   Compared with acknowledgment mechanism of TCP [RFC793], EUDP provides
   simpler and more liberal system.  While TCP makes using the packet

   sequence numbers and acknowledgement mandatory, EUDP allows the host
   to decide whether the packet needs to be acknowledged by the other
   side or not.

2.6. Compatibility with UDP

   The applications which use UDP can safely use EUDP with no options
   instead.


3.  Security Considerations

   Generic security issues for UDP concern EUDP as well.

   Additional security can be provided by EUDP options.  This document
   does not define such options.

   UDP itself does not provide any authentication features.  Such
   features can be provided by additional options, which are not defined
   by this document.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1. 'EUDP Options Numbers' Registry

   IANA is asked to create and maintain the registry named 'EUDP Options
   Numbers Registry' following the guidelines below.

   The regsitry consists of 5 values: Option Kind, Option Length,
   Support Criteria, Name and Reference. They are described below.

     Option Kind - an integer; refers to the value used in EUDP options.
     Values from 0 to 255 are assigned.

     Option Length - an integer, 'variable' (for multi-octet options) or
     'N/A' (for one-octet options).

     Support Criteria -  'Mandatory' and 'Elective' (see Section 2.3.1).

     Name - contains the name of the option.

     Reference - the reference to the document, that defines the option.

   The initial values are given below; assignments to this registry for
   _mandatory_ options are to be made following the 'IETF Consensus'
   policies; for _elective_ options - following the 'RFC required'
   policies. [RFC5226]

4.2. EUDP Port Numbers Assignment

   As EUDP uses the same port set as UDP, IANA is asked to mark the UDP
   port numbers registry values may be used with EUDP as well.
