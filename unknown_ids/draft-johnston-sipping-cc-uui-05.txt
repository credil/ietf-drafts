Abstract

   Several approaches to transporting the ITU-T Q.931 User to User
   Information Element (UU IE) data in SIP have been proposed.  As
   networks move to SIP it is important that applications requiring this
   data can continue to function in SIP networks as well as the ability
   to interwork the information to/from ISDN for end-to-end
   transparency.  This extension will also be used for native SIP
   endpoints implementing similar services and interworking with ISDN
   services.  This document discusses requirements and approaches and
   recommends a new header field User-to-User be standardized.  Example
   use cases include an exchange between two User Agents, retargeting by
   a proxy, and redirection.  An example application is in an Automatic

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2008


1.  Overview

   This document describes the transport of User to User Information
   (UUI) in ISDN interworking scenarios using SIP [RFC3261].
   Specifically, we discuss the transport of call control related ITU-T
   Q.931 User to User Information Element (UU IE) [Q931] data in SIP.
   Q.931 UUI is widely used in the PSTN today in contact center and call
   centers which are transitioning away from ISDN to SIP.  This
   extension will also be used for native SIP endpoints implementing
   similar services and interworking with ISDN services.  Five different
   use case call flows are discussed.

   It is important to note that this extension will not be used for
   transport of information where the content is known and a specific
   SIP header field exists for carrying this information.  For cases
   where the content of user to user information is relevant to SIP, it
   is expected a new SIP header field will be created to transport the
   information.  For example, location information is an example of user
   to user information, and obviously it needs to be transported in a
   specifically named SIP header rather than transported using this
   generic mechanism.  It is also important to note that standardization
   of the UUI content is explicitly out of scope for this specification.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements

   This section discusses the requirements for the transport of call
   control related user to user information (UUI).  We define call
   control UUI as information that is generated, transported, and
   consumed at the time of call setup (i.e. during a pending INVITE
   transaction).  The information can be used for call routing,
   alerting, call distribution, or simply rendering.  The exact usage
   and semantics of call control UUI is out of scope - SIP is simply
   providing the transport function for this that ISDN Provides in the
   PSTN.  Non-call control UUI can be sent using the INFO method and not
   using the extensions described in this specification.

   REQ-1: The mechanism will allow UAs to insert and receive ITU-T Q.931
   User to User Information Element (referred to as UUI) data in SIP
   call setup requests and responses.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2008


      SIP messages covered by this include INVITE requests and end-to-
      end responses to the INVITE, which includes 18x and 200 responses.

   REQ-2: The mechanism will allow UAs to insert and receive ITU-T Q.931
   User to User Information Element (referred to as UUI) data in SIP
   call teardown requests and responses.

      Q.931 UUI supports inclusion in release and release completion
      messages.  SIP messages covered by this include BYE and 200 OK
      responses to a BYE.

   REQ-3: The mechanism will allow UUI to be inserted and retrieved in
   SIP redirects to INVITEs.

      SIP messages covered by this include 3xx responses to INVITE and
      REFER requests.

   REQ-4: The mechanism will allow UUI to be able to survive proxy
   retargeting.

      Retargeting is a common method of call routing in SIP, and must
      not result in the loss of user to user information.

   REQ-5: The mechanism will allow the UUI to be transported directly in
   the SIP message.

      Passing a pointer or link to the UUI information will not meet the
      real-time processing considerations.

   REQ-6: The mechanism will minimize reliance on SIP extensions or
   uncommon SIP behavior.

   REQ-7: The mechanism will allow the inserter of UUI to be sure that
   the recipient understands the call control UUI mechanism.

      Understanding the mechanism means that the UAS will extract and
      utlize the UUI information transported.  Understanding the format
      and nature of the actual UUI data is not covered by this
      requirement.


4.  Use Cases

   This section discusses four uses cases for the transport of call
   control related user to user information.  What is not discussed here
   is the transport of non-call control UUI which can be done using the
   SIP INFO method.  These use cases help explain the requirements from
   the previous section.

4.1.  User Agent to User Agent

   In this scenario, the originator UA includes UUI in the INVITE sent
   through a proxy to the terminating UA.  The terminator can use the
   UUI in any way.  If it is an ISDN gateway, it could map the UUI into
   the appropriate Q.931 element.  Alternatively, it might render the
   information to the user, or use it for alerting or as a lookup for a
   screen pop.  In this case, the proxy does not need to understand the
   UUI mechanism, but normal proxy rules should result in the UUI being
   forwarded without modification.  This call flow is shown in Figure 1.

              Originator              Proxy             Terminator
                   |                    |                    |
                   |   INVITE (UUI) F1  |                    |
                   |------------------->|   INVITE (UUI) F2  |

                   |          200 OK F5 |<-------------------|
                   |<-------------------|                    |

                   |------------------->|            ACK F7  |
                   |                    |------------------->|

   Figure 1.  Call flow with UUI exchanged between Originator and
   Terminator.

   This call flow utilizes REQ-1.

4.2.  Proxy Retargeting

   In this scenario, the originator UA includes UUI in the INVITE sent
   through a proxy to the terminating UA.  The proxy retargets the
   INVITE, sending it to a different termination UA.  The UUI
   information is then processed by the terminating UA.  This call flow
   is shown in Figure 2.

              Originator              Proxy            Terminator 2
                   |                    |                    |
                   |   INVITE (UUI) F1  |                    |
                   |------------------->|   INVITE (UUI) F2  |
                   |      100 Trying F3 |------------------->|
                   |<-------------------|         200 OK F4  |

                   |<-------------------|                    |

                   |------------------->|            ACK F7  |
                   |                    |------------------->|

   Figure 2.  Call flow with Proxy Retargeting.

   This call flow utilizes REQ-1 and REQ-4.

4.3.  Redirection

   In this scenario, UUI is inserted by a redirect server which is then
   included in the INVITE sent by the Originator to the Terminator.  In
   this case, the Originator does not necessarily need to support the
   UUI mechanism but does need to support the SIP redirection mechanism
   used to include the UUI information.

              Originator          Redirect Server        Terminator
                   |                    |                    |
                   |          INVITE F1 |                    |
                   |------------------->|                    |
                   | 302 Moved (UUI) F2 |                    |

                   |------------------->|                    |
                   |  INVITE (UUI) F4   |                    |
                   |---------------------------------------->|
                   |  200 OK F5                              |
                   |<----------------------------------------|
                   |  ACK F6                                 |
                   |---------------------------------------->|

   Figure 3.  Call flow with UUI exchanged between Redirect Server and
   Terminator

   This call flow utilizes REQ-1 and REQ-3.

   A common application of this call flow is an Automatic Call
   Distributer (ACD) in a PSTN contact center.  The originator would be
   a PSTN gateway.  The ACD would act as a Redirect Server, inserting
   UUI based on called number, calling number, time of day, and other
   information.  The resulting UUI would be passed to the agent's
   handset which acts as the Terminator.  The UUI could be used to
   lookup information rendered to the agent at the time of call
   answering.

4.4.  Referral

   In this scenario, a Referrer UA causes an INVITE to be generated
   between the Originator and Terminator with UUI information inserted
   by the Referrer UA.  Note that this REFER [RFC3515] could be part of
   a transfer operation or it might be unrelated to an existing call,
   such as out-of-dialog REFER call control.  In some cases, this call

   flow is used in place of the redirection call flow, but where
   immediately upon answer, the REFER is sent.  This scenario is shown
   in Figure 4.

              Originator           Referrer             Terminator

   Figure 4.  Call flow with transfer after answer.

   Some scenarios involving referral have been proposed to use a REFER
   sent during an early dialog.  This NOT RECOMMENDED call flow is shown
   in Figure 5.  This flow is not recommended due to the number of
   messages exchanged (due to the REFER, CANCEL, and 487 responses) and
   the sending of the REFER in the early dialog.

5.  Possible Mechanisms

   Three mechanisms for transporting UUI will be described: MIME body,
   URI parameter, and header field transport.

5.1.  Why INFO is Not Used

   Since the INFO method [RFC2976]., was developed for ISUP interworking
   of user-to-user information, it might seem to be the logical choice
   here.  For non-call control user-to-user information, INFO can be
   utilized for end to end transport.  However, for transport of call
   control user-to-user information, INFO can not be used.  As the call



Johnston & McMillen        Expires May 4, 2009                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2008


   flows in the previous section show, the information is related to an
   attempt to establish a session and must be passed with the session
   setup request (INVITE), responses to that INVITE, or session
   termination requests.  As a result, it is not possible to use INFO in
   these cases.

5.2.  MIME body Approach

   One method of transport is to transport the UUI information as a MIME
   body.  This is in keeping with the SIP-T architecture [RFC3372] in
   which MIME bodies are used to transport ISUP information.  Since the
   INVITE will normally have an SDP message body, the resulting INVITE
   with SDP and UUI will be multipart MIME.  The insertion of a UUI
   message body by a redirect server or in a REFER is difficult.  The
   body would need to be encoded in the Contact URI of the 3xx response
   or the Refer-To URI of a REFER.  For example:

  <allOneLine>
  Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?Content-Type=
  application/isup&body=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
  </allOneLine>

   Note that the <allOneLine> tag convention from SIP Torture Test
   Messages [RFC4475] is used to show that there are no line breaks in
   the actual message syntax.

   The MIME body approach meets REQs 1-5.  However, it does not meet
   REQ-6 as support for Multipart MIME and escaped bodies in URIs is
   uncommon in SIP UAs.

5.3.  URI Parameter

   Another proposed approach is to encode the UUI as a URI parameter
   into the Contact or Refer-To URI.

  <allOneLine>
  Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com;uui=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6
  F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
  </allOneLine>

   The resulting INVITE would contain UUI in the Request-URI of the
   INVITE.  The URI parameter has a drawback in that a URI parameter
   will not survive retargeting by a proxy as shown in Figure 2.  That
   is, if the URI is an Address of Record instead of a Contact URI, the
   URI parameter will not be copied over the Contact URI, resulting in
   the loss of the information.  As a result, this approach does not
   meet REQ-4.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2008


5.4.  Header Field Approach

   Another approach that has been proposed is to use a header field to
   transport the UUI information.  The header field would be included in
   INVITE requests and responses and BYE requests and responses, and
   would pass transparently through proxies.  For redirection, the
   header field would be escaped into the Contact or Refer-To URI.  This
   is commonly supported in UAs due to call transfer use cases.  As a
   result, the header field approach supports REQs 1-6.  In order to
   meet REQ-7, a SIP feature tag is needed which can be included in
   Supported and Require header fields.

   The Call-Info header field is related to the UUI information.
   However, there are a number of important differences:

      Call-Info is typically used for rendering to the user.  While some
      of the UUI information may ultimately be rendered to the user,
      most of the UUI information will be consumed by the end device.

      Call-Info usually contains a URI pointer the information instead
      of the actual information itself which does not REQ-5.  It could
      be possible to use a data URI to carry the UUI directly in this
      header field.

   Overall, the overloading of the Call-Info header field for carrying
   ISUP UUI does not seem like a good idea.  For these reasons, a
   separate header field needs to be defined, described here as User-to-
   User.  For example, here is an example User-to-User header field from
   message F1 in Figure 1:

   User-to-User: 56a390f3d2b7310023a;encoding=hex

   For example, here is an escaped User-to-User header field from the
   redirection response F2 of Figure 3:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?User-to-User=
   56a390f3d2b7310023a%3Bencoding%3Dhex>
   </allOneLine>

   The resulting INVITE F5 would contain the User-to-User header field
   of the previous example.

   An escaped User-to-User header field from the REFER message response
   F1 of Figure 4:

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2008


   <allOneLine>
   Refer-To: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?User-to-User=
   56a390f3d2b7310023a%3Bencoding%3Dhex>
   </allOneLine>

   This would result in the INVITE F4 containing the User-to-User header
   field of the first example.


6.  Recommendation

   The recommendation is to define a new SIP header field "User-to-User"
   to transport UUI information in ISDN interworking applications since
   this mechanism best supports the requirements.  A SIP feature tag
   "uui" also needs to be defined so that it can be used in Supported
   and Require header fields to meet REQ-6.

   The format of the UUI information is a topic of future
   standardization.  Currently, UUI is proprietary, requiring
   coordinated configuration between servers.  Standardizing the format
   or providing content tags would provide additional benefits.


7.  Appendix - Syntax for UUI Header Field

   Editor's Note: Eventually this text will move to a SIP Working Group
   document to define the new header field.

   The User-to-User header field can be present in INVITE requests and
   responses only and in BYE requests and responses.

   Current usage is to interoperate with ISDN User to User Signaling
   (UUS), a supplementary service in which manufacturer specific
   information is transported via the codeset 0 User-user Information
   IE.  Three services are defined: service 1, service 2, and service 3.
   This draft only addresses the SIP equivalent of service 1 although it
   could easily be expanded later to address services 2 and 3.  UUS
   Service 1 involves user to user signaling exchanged during call setup
   and clearing within the following Q.931 call control messages: SETUP,
   ALERT, CONNECT, DISCONNECT, RELEASE, and RELEASE COMPLETE.  UUS
   Service 2 involves user to user signaling exchanged during call
   establishment (between ALERT and CONNECT) via the USER INFORMATION
   message.  This service usually has a maximum of 2 USER INFORMATION
   messages in each direction.  UUS Service 3 involves user to user
   signaling exchanged on an active call via the USER INFORMATION
   message.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur



Johnston & McMillen        Expires May 4, 2009                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2008


   Form (BNF) as described in RFC 2234 and extends RFC 3261.

         UUI         = "User-to-User" HCOLON uui-data *(SEMI uui-param)
         uui-data    = token
         uui-param   = enc-param | generic-param
         enc-param   = "encoding=" ("hex" | token)

   Only one User-to-User header field may be present in a request or
   response.

      OPEN ISSUE: Should we allow multiple User-to-User header fields in
      SIP even though ISDN does not support this?  If so, we would need
      to provide guidance for a SIP to ISDN gateway for mapping, such as
      map the first header field and drop the rest.

   The only defined parameter for the User-to-User header field is the
   encoding parameter. "encoding=hex" is used to indicate that the UUI
   information is encoded as hex digits per the ISDN specification.  The
   first octet is the protocol discriminator).  Other encoding methods
   of encoding may also be standardized.

      OPEN ISSUE: Is there an advantage in extracting the protocol
      discriminator and encoding in a header parameter?  What would a
      SIP UA do with this information?

   Note that ISDN limits UUI to 128 octets in length.  While this header
   field has no such limitations, transporting UUI longer than 128
   octets will result in interoperability failures when interworking
   with ISDN.


8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Registration of Header Field

   This document defines a new SIP header field named "User-to-User".

   The following row shall be added to the "Header Fields" section of
   the SIP parameter registry:

                 | Header Name      | Compact Form | Reference |
                 +------------------+--------------+-----------+
                 | User-to-User     |              | [RFCXXXX] |
                 +------------------+--------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of

   this document.

8.2.  Registration of Header Field Parameter

   This document defines a parameter for the header field defined in the
   preceding section.  The header field "User-to-User" can contain the
   parameter "encoding".

   The following rows shall be added to the "Header Field Parameters and
   Parameter Values" section of the SIP parameter registry:


   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
   | Header Field     | Parameter Name | Predefined Values | Reference |
   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
   | User-to-User     | encoding       | No                | [RFCXXXX] |
   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   this document.

8.3.  Registration of SIP Option Tag

   This specification registers a new SIP option tag, as per the
   guidelines in Section 27.1 of [RFC3261].

   This document defines the SIP option tag "uui".

   The following row has been added to the "Option Tags" section of the
   SIP Parameter Registry:

   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | Name       | Description                              | Reference |
   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | uui        | This option tag is used to indicate that | [RFCXXXX] |
   |            | a UA supports and understands the        |           |
   |            | User-to-User header field.               |           |
   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   this document.


9.  Security Considerations

   User to user information can be exchanged over SIP on a hop-by-hop or
   end-to-end basis.  In some cases, it may carry private information
   that may need confidential transport and integrity protection.



Johnston & McMillen        Expires May 4, 2009                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2008


   Standard SIP security mechanisms can be used to secure this header
   field.  For example, TLS transport can provide single hop
   confidentiality and integrity protection.  For multiple hop or end-
   to-end confidentiality and integrity protection, S/MIME can be
   utilized.

   Information contained in a User-to-User header field should only be
   trusted if it is received within a trust domain.  For example,
   Spec-T, defined in [RFC3324] could be used to define a trust domain.
   When utilized by a gateway to map information to or from ISDN Q.931,
   appropriate policy should be applied based on the PSTN trust domain.
