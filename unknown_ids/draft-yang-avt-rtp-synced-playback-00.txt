Abstract

   When watching the same IPTV channel, different TV sets may not
   render the same picture and the associated audio at the same moment.
   This variation of end-to-end delay between users is referred to as
   inter-user playback delay.  Unicast based rapid acquisition of
   multicast RTP sessions (RAMS) as specified in [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-
   acquisition-for-rtp] is an important technique in achieving fast
   channel switching in IPTV applications.  In addition, RAMS also
   significantly relaxes the requirement of relatively short random
   access point period in encoding of video streams in multicast
   applications, thus allowing significantly improved compression
   efficiency.  However, on the other hand, the use of RAMS increases
   inter-user playback delay.  This document specifies a mechanism to
   help reduce inter-user playback delay in RAMS.

1. Introduction

   The Internet-Draft "Unicast-Based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast
   RTP Sessions" in [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] presents
   a method based on unicast burst stream for rapid acquisition of
   multicast RTP sessions (RAMS), thus to reduce the waiting time for
   the so-called Reference Information (RI).  This method is effective
   in reducing channel switching and tune-in delay in multicast
   applications, such as IPTV.  The RI typically starts at an access
   unit that is a random access point.  In RAMS, RTP receivers start
   playback from the random access point from which the RI starts when
   they switch from one multicast session to another.  As the unicast
   burst stream starts from the RI and is transmitted as fast as
   possible and faster than the media rate, on average the receiver
   can start processing the unicast burst stream almost immediately,
   and does not need to wait for the next random access point if it
   directly joined the multicast group.

   Another important benefit brought by RAMS is that significantly
   improved coding efficiency for video streams is possible.  In
   conventional multicast applications, video streams must be encoded
   with frequent random access points, e.g. 0.5 to 1 second, to allow
   new receivers to tune-in or existing users to switching from
   another multicast session.  Random access points typically contain
   intra-coded pictures, for which the compression efficiency is
   significantly, e.g., several to ten times, lower than inter-coded
   pictures.  Therefore, the less the random access points, the higher
   the coding efficiency.  When RAMS is in use, random access period
   length is less critical for the tune-in or channel switching delay.
   This means that the video random access point frequency can be
   significantly reduced, leading to significantly improved
   compression efficiency.

   In multicast applications, receivers receiving the same multicast
   session can not playback the same content in an absolutely
   synchronized manner, due to the variation in various delays
   including end-to-end transmission delay, receiver buffering delay,
   decoding buffering delay, and output buffering delay.  Moreover,
   events like session transfer or rebroadcast can further increase
   inter-user playback delay.  Thus, different users may watch
   different pictures from different TV sets when watching the same
   IPTV content.  In this document, this playback delay variation
   between different users is referred to as inter-user playback delay.

   In some application scenarios, e.g., remote education or a
   discussion room for an ongoing TV program in a social network,
   different users may be discussing the same content received through
   multicast.  In this case, an obvious playback synchronization loss
   due to excessive inter-user playback delay can generate bad user
   experience.

   A disadvantage of RAMS is that the use of the technique increases
   inter-user playback delay.  Regardless of when the receiver starts
   the RAMS request (i.e. joins the program), the playback will start
   from the previous random access point.  Thus, the later the
   receiver joins the program in between two random access points, the
   longer the display delay will the user have compared to other users.
   The longest inter-user playback delay due to the use of RAMS is
   close to the interval between the two random access points, when
   one user joins the program right after the first random access
   point while another user joins the program right before second
   random access point, as depicted in Figure 1 below.  In Figure 1,
   the two I frames are two consecutive random access points.

    |<--The longest inter-user playback delay due to RAMS use-->|

         Figure 1 Inter-user playback delay due to the use of RAMS

   As can be seen from the above analysis, the issue of inter-user
   playback delay also constrains the use of long random access period
   length for improved compression efficiency, which has been another
   important benefit of RAMS.

   In this document, we describe a mechanism to reduce inter-user
   playback delay and to allow the use of long random access period
   length for improved compression efficiency when RAMS is in use.

3. Definitions

   This document uses the following acronyms and definitions:

   Inter-User Playback Delay: The playback delay between different
   users for the same content on the same multicast session.

4. Inter-User Playback Delay Reduction

   The mechanism involves the following changes to the RAMS method:

   1) When the RTP Receiver (RR) sends a rapid acquisition request for
      the new multicast RTP session, the request MAY contain
      additional information indicating whether RR supports inter-user
      playback delay reduction.

   2) When the Retransmission Sever (RS) receives the RAMS-R message
      and decides to accept it, RS MAY include the following
      additional information in the RAMS-I message to RR:

      a) N, the playback delay reduction target in number of frame
         durations; and

      b) V, recommended interval, in frames, between two continuous
         events for skipping of one frame.

      When the RAMS-R message indicates that RR supports inter-user
      playback delay reduction, RS SHOULD include the above
      information in the RAMS-I message.

   3) When RR receives an RAMS-I message containing the above
      information, it SHOULD speed up media rendering during playback
      taking into account the information as follows.  During the
      speedup playback, after each V frames, one frame is skipped as
      if it was not present, and the presentation time of each
      remaining frame is shifted earlier by one frame duration, until
      totally N frames have been skipped. Receivers will playback the
      media content with its original speed after totally N frames
      have been skipped.  Note that decoding remains the same as if
      speedup playback was not in use.

5. Message Extensions

   This section defines the extensions to RAMS-R and RAMS-I messages
   for inter-user playback delay reduction.
