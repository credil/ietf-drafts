                Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
                        draft-ietf-core-coap-02

Abstract

   This document specifies the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),
   a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained networks
   and nodes for machine-to-machine applications such as smart energy
   and building automation.  These constrained nodes often have 8-bit
   microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while networks
   such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates and a typical
   throughput of 10s of kbit/s.  CoAP provides a method/response
   interaction model between application end-points, supports built-in
   resource discovery, and includes key web concepts such as URIs and
   content-types.  CoAP easily translates to HTTP for integration with
   the web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast
   support, very low overhead and simplicity for constrained
   environments.

1.  Introduction

   The use of web services on the Internet has become ubiquitous in most
   applications, and depends on the fundamental Representational State
   Transfer (REST) architecture of the web.

   The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) working group aims at
   realizing the REST architecture in a suitable form for the most
   constrained nodes (e.g. 8-bit microcontrollers with limited RAM and
   ROM) and networks (e.g. 6LoWPAN).  Constrained networks like 6LoWPAN
   support the expensive fragmentation of IPv6 packets into small link-
   layer frames.  One design goal of CoRE has been to keep message
   overhead small, thus limiting the use of fragmentation.

   One of the main goals of CoRE is to design a generic web protocol for
   the special requirements of this constrained environment, especially
   considering energy, building automation and other M2M applications.
   The goal of CoAP is not to blindly compress HTTP, but rather to
   realize a subset of REST common with HTTP but optimized for M2M
   applications.  Although CoRE could be used for compressing simple
   HTTP interfaces, it more importantly also offers features for M2M
   such as built-in discovery, multicast support and asynchronous
   transactions.

   This document specifies the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) ,
   which easily translates to HTTP for integration with the existing web
   while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support,
   very low overhead and simplicity for constrained environments and M2M
   applications [I-D.shelby-core-coap-req].  CoAP has the following main
   features:

   o  Constrained web protocol fulfilling M2M requirements.

   o  A stateless HTTP mapping, allowing proxies to be built providing
      access to CoAP resources via HTTP in a uniform way or for HTTP
      simple interfaces to be realized alternatively over CoAP.

   o  UDP binding with reliable unicast and best-effort multicast
      support.

   o  Asynchronous transaction support.

   o  Low header overhead and parsing complexity.

   o  URI and Content-type support.

   o  Built-in resource discovery.

   o  Simple proxy and caching capabilities.


2.  Constrained Application Protocol

   This section specifies the basic functionality and processing rules
   of the protocol.

2.1.  Interaction Model

   The interaction model of CoAP is similar to the client/server model
   of HTTP.  However, Machine-to-machine interactions typically result
   in a CoAP implementation acting in both client and server roles
   (called an end-point).  A CoAP exchange is equivalent to that of
   HTTP, and is sent by a client to request an action (using a Method
   Code) on a resource (identified by a URI) on a server.  A response is
   then sent with a Response Code and resource representation if
   appropriate.

   Unlike HTTP, CoAP deals with these interchanges asynchronously over a
   UDP transport with support for both unicast and multicast
   interactions.  This is achieved using transaction messages
   (Confirmable, Non-Confirmable, Acknowledgment, Reset) supporting
   optional reliability (with exponential back-off) and transaction IDs
   between end-points to carry requests and responses.  These
   transactions are transparent to the request/response interchanges.
   The only difference being that responses may arrive asynchronously.

   One could think of CoAP as using a two-layer approach, a
   transactional layer used to deal with UDP and the asynchronous nature
   of the interactions, and the request/response interactions using
   Method and Response codes.

2.1.1.  Synchronous response

   The most basic interaction between the Req/Res and Transaction layers
   works by sending a request in a confirmable CoAP message and waiting
   for an acknowledgment message that also carries the response.  E.g.,
   two possible interactions for a basic GET are shown in Figure 2.

   Client             Server       Client             Server
      |                 |             |                 |
      |    CON tid=47   |             |    CON tid=53   |
      |     GET /foo    |             |     GET /baz    |
      +---------------->|             +---------------->|
      |                 |             |                 |
      |    ACK tid=47   |             |    ACK tid=53   |
      |  200 "<temp...  |             |    404 "Not...  |
      |<----------------+             |<----------------+
      |                 |             |                 |

    Figure 2: Two basic GET transactions, one successful, one not found

   Note that at the transaction layer, the response is returned in an
   ACK message, independent of whether the request was successful at the
   Req/Res layer.  In effect, the response is piggy-backed on the ACK
   message, so no separate acknowledgment is required that the GET
   message was received.

   The relationship between the confirmable message (CON) and the
   acknowledgment message (ACK) is indicated by the transaction ID,
   which is echoed back by the server in the ACK.  Transaction IDs are
   short-lived, they only serve to couple CON and ACK messages.

   The tight coupling between CON and ACK also relieves the ACK of the
   need to echo back information from the request, such as the URI or a
   request token supplied by the client.  We say that a response carried
   in an ACK _pertains_ to the request in the corresponding CON.

2.1.2.  Asynchronous response

   Not all interactions are as simple as the basic synchronous exchange
   shown.  For example, a server might need longer to obtain the
   representation of the resource requested than it can wait sending
   back the acknowledgment, without risking the client to repeatedly
   retransmit the request.  To handle this case, the response is
   decoupled from the transaction layer acknowledgment.  Actually, the
   latter does not carry any message at all.

   As the client cannot know that this will be the case, it sends
   exactly the same confirmable message with the same request.  The

   server maybe attempts to obtain the resource (e.g., by acting as a
   proxy) and times out an ACK timer, or it immediately sends an
   acknowledgment knowing in advance that there will be no quick answer.
   The acknowledgment effectively is a promise that the request will be
   acted upon, see Figure 3.

   Client             Server
      |                 |
      |   CON tid=48    |
      |  GET http://n.. |
      +---------------->|
      |                 |
      |   ACK tid=48    |
      |<----------------+
      |                 |
      ... Time Passes ...
      |                 |

      |     "<html..    |

      +---------------->|
      |                 |

                 Figure 3: An asynchronous GET transaction

   When the server finally has obtained the resource representation and
   is ready to send the response, it initiates a transaction to the
   client.  This new transaction has its own transaction ID, so there is
   no automatic coupling of the response to the request.  Instead, the
   URI (and possibly token) is echoed back to the client in order to
   associate the response to the original request.  To ensure that this
   message is not lost, it is again sent as a confirmable message and
   answered by the client with an ACK, citing the new TID chosen by the
   server.

   As a special failure situation, a client may no longer be aware that
   it sent a request, e.g., if it does not have stable storage and was
   rebooted in the meantime.  This can be indicated by a special "Reset"
   message, as shown in Figure 4.

2.2.  Transaction messages

   The CoAP transactions make use of four different message types,
   described in this section.  These messages are transparent to the
   request/response carried over them.

2.2.1.  Confirmable (CON)

   Some messages require an acknowledgment, either just to know they did
   arrive or also to deliver the reply to a request.  We call these
   messages "Confirmable".  When no packets are lost, each Confirmable
   message elicits exactly one return message of type Acknowledgment or
   type Reset.

2.2.2.  Non-Confirmable (NON)

   Some other messages do not require an acknowledgment.  This is
   particularly true for messages that are repeated regularly for
   application requirements, such as repeated readings from a sensor
   where eventual arrival is sufficient.

2.2.3.  Acknowledgment (ACK)

   An Acknowledgment message acknowledges that a specific Confirmable
   message (identified by its Transaction ID) arrived.  As with all of
   the message types itself, it may carry a payload and some options to
   provide more details, such as the result of a request that was
   carried in the Confirmable.

2.2.4.  Reset (RST)

   A Reset message indicates that a specific Confirmable message was
   received, but some context is missing to properly process it.  This
   condition is usually caused when the receiving node has rebooted and

Internet-Draft   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)  September 2010


   has forgotten some state that would be required to interpret the
   message.

2.2.5.  Transaction IDs

   The Transaction ID is an unsigned integer kept by a CoAP end-point
   for all of the CoAP Confirmable or Non-Confirmable messages it sends.
   Each CoAP end-point keeps a single Transaction ID variable, which is
   changed each time a new Confirmable or Non-Confirmable message is
   sent regardless of the destination address or port.  The Transaction
   ID is used to match an Acknowledgment with an outstanding request,
   for retransmission and to discard duplicate messages.  The initial
   Transaction ID should be randomized.  The same Transaction ID MUST
   NOT be re-used within the potential retransmission window, calculated
   as RESPONSE_TIMEOUT * (2 ^ MAX_RETRANSMIT - 1).

2.3.  Methods

   CoAP supports the basic methods of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, which are
   easily mapped to HTTP.  In this section each method is defined along
   with its behavior.  A unicast request with an unknown or unsupported
   Method Code MUST generate a message with a "405 Method Not Allowed"
   Response Code.

   As CoAP methods manipulate resources, they have the same properties
   of safe (only retrieval) and idempotent (you can invoke it multiple
   times with the same effects) as HTTP Section 9.1 [RFC2616].  The GET
   method is safe, therefore it MUST NOT take any other action on a
   resource other than retrieval.  The GET, PUT and DELETE methods MUST
   be performed in such a way that they are idempotent.  Unlike PUT,
   POST is not idempotent because the URI in the request indicates the
   resource that will handle the enclosed body.  This resource indicated
   by the POST may be used for data processing, a gateway to other
   protocols and it may create a new resource as a result of the POST.

2.3.1.  GET

   The GET method retrieves the information of the resource identified
   by the request URI.  Upon success a 200 (OK) response SHOULD be sent.

   The response to a GET is cacheable if it meets the requirements in
   Section 5.

2.3.2.  POST

   The POST method is used to request the server to create a new
   resource under the requested URI.  If a resource has been created on
   the server, the response SHOULD be 201 (Created) including the URI of

   the new resource in a Location Option with any possible status in the
   message body.  If the POST succeeds but does not result in a new
   resource being created on the server, a 200 (OK) response code SHOULD
   be returned.

   Responses to this method are not cacheable.

2.3.3.  PUT

   The PUT method requests that the resource identified by the request
   URI be updated or created with the enclosed message body.  If a
   resource exists at that URI the message body SHOULD be considered a
   modified version of that resource, and a 200 (OK) response SHOULD be
   returned.  If no resource exists then the server MAY create a new
   resource with that URI, resulting in a 201 (Created) response.  If
   the resource could not be created or modified, then an appropriate
   error response code SHOULD be sent.

   Responses to this method are not cacheable.

2.3.4.  DELETE

   The DELETE method requests that the resource identified by the
   request URI be deleted.  The response 200 (OK) SHOULD be sent on
   success.

   Responses to this method are not cacheable.

2.4.  Response Codes

   CoAP makes use of a subset of HTTP response codes as defined in
   Section 11.1.

2.5.  Options

   CoAP makes use of compact, extensible Type-Length-Value (TLV) style
   options.  This section explains the processing of CoAP options along
   with a summary of the main features implemented in options such as
   URIs and Content-types.

2.5.1.  Option Processing

   If no options are to be included, the Option Count field is set to 0
   below and the Payload (if any) immediately follows the Transaction
   ID.  If options are to be included, the following rules apply.  The
   number of options is placed in the Option Count field.  Each option
   is then placed in order of Type, immediately following the
   Transaction ID with no padding.  Upon reception, unknown options of



Shelby, et al.           Expires March 31, 2011                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)  September 2010


   class "elective" MUST be silently skipped.  Unknown options of class
   "critical" in a Confirmable SHOULD cause the return of a response
   code "400 Bad Request" (TBD) including a copy of the critical option
   number in the payload of the response.

2.5.2.  URIs

   The Universal Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] is an important
   feature of the web architecture, where the relative part of the URI
   indicates the resource being manipulated.  CoAP supports URIs
   similarly to HTTP, e.g. coap://[2001:DB8::101]/s/temp.  As this URI
   is used purely as a locator, CoAP only supports Universal Resource
   Locator features of [RFC3986] although throughout the document we
   refer to URI.

   CoAP splits the URI up into its three parts with the default coap://
   scheme, Uri-Authority and Uri-Path Options.  The full URI can be
   created by concatenating those parts (or their defaults if not
   present).  CoAP does not support "." or ".." in URIs nor does it
   support IRIs.  A CoAP implementation SHOULD support query "?"
   processing, however fragment "#" processing is not supported.  All
   URI strings in CoAP MUST use the US-ASCII encoding defined in
   [RFC3986].  When using the Uri-Path Option the leading slash MUST be
   omitted.  Thus the above example "/s/temp" is included in the Uri-
   Path Option as "s/temp".

   The authority part of a URI is important in determining the correct
   representation to return on end-points maintaining virtual servers
   and for intermediate components such as proxies.  For this reason it
   is important that the full URI can be reconstructed when needed.
   However, at the same time, it is often advantageous for CoAP to elide
   the Uri-Authority when it is unknown or identical to the IPv6
   destination address for efficiency.  The following rules apply to
   processing a CoAP request:

   1.  If the Uri-Authority option is absent and the remainder of the
       URI uniquely identifies a resource the server MAY proceed to
       execute the request.

   2.  If an origin server is able to determine the IP destination
       address of the request, it MAY assume this as the authority of
       the URI.

   3.  If no authority can be determined and the server requires the
       authority to identify the resource it MUST reject the request
       with "400 Bad Request" (TBD: 400 is already overloaded, thus a
       new response code may be created for this purpose).

Internet-Draft   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)  September 2010


   Application designers are encouraged to make use of short, but
   descriptive URIs.  For example URIs 14 or less bytes in length fit in
   a more compact option header.  In addition, very short URIs such as
   "/1" can be assigned as an alternative short URI for a resource by
   the application.  The CoRE Link Format includes an attribute to
   indicate if a short alternative URI of a resource is available (REF).

   The CoAP protocol scheme is identified in URIs with "coap://"
   [IANA_TBD_SCHEME].

2.5.3.  Content-type encoding

   In order to support heterogeneous uses, CoAP is transparent to the
   use of different application payloads.  In order for the application
   process receiving a packet to properly parse a payload, its content-
   type should be explicitly known from the header (as e.g. with HTTP).
   The use of typical binary encodings for XML is discussed in
   [I-D.shelby-6lowapp-encoding].

   String names of Internet media types (MIME types) [RFC2046] are not
   optimal for use in the CoAP header.  Instead, CoAP simply assigns
   identifiers to a subset of common media and content transfer encoding
   types.  The content-type identifier is optionally included in the
   Content-type Option Header of messages to indicate the type of the
   message body.  CoAP Content-type identifiers are defined in
   Section 11.2.  In the absence of the Content-type Option the MIME
   type "text/plain" MUST BE assumed.


3.  Message Formats

   CoAP makes use of asynchronous transactions using a simple binary
   header format.  This base header may be followed by options in Type-
   Length-Value (TLV) format.  CoAP is bound to UDP as described in
   Section 4.

   Any bytes after the headers in the packet are considered the message
   payload, if any.  The length of the message payload is implied by the
   datagram length.  See Section 4 for further message length
   requirements.

3.1.  CoAP header

   This section defines the CoAP header, which is shared for all CoAP
   messages.  CoAP makes use of an asynchronous transaction model.
   These transactions are used to carry request/response exchanges,
   either using a Method Code (GET/PUT/POST/DELETE) to invoke
   interaction with a resource, or a Response Code carried in an

   Header Fields:

      Ver:  Version. 2-bit unsigned integer.  Indicates the version of
         CoAP.  Implementations of this specification MUST set this
         field to 1.  Other values are reserved for future versions.

      T: 2-bit unsigned integer Transaction Type field.  Indicates if
         this message is Confirmable (0), Non-Confirmable (1),
         Acknowledgment (2) or Reset (3).

      OC:  4-bit unsigned integer Option Count field.  Indicates if
         there are Option Headers following the base header.  If set to
         0 the payload (if any) immediately follows the base header.  If
         greater than zero the field indicates the number of options to
         immediately follow the header.

      Code:  8-bit unsigned integer.  This field indicates the Method or
         Response Code of a message.  The value 0 indicates no code.
         The values 1-10 are used for Method Codes as defined in
         Table 1.  The values 11-39 are reserved for future use.  The
         values 40-255 are used for Response Codes as defined in
         Section 11.1.

      Transaction ID:  16-bit unsigned integer.  A unique Transaction ID
         assigned by the source and used to match responses.  The
         Transaction ID MUST be changed for each new request (regardless
         of the end-point) and MUST NOT be changed when retransmitting a
         request (see Section 2.2.5).

3.2.  Header options

   CoAP messages may also include one or more header options in TLV
   format.  Options MUST appear in order of option type (see Table 2).
   A delta encoding is used between each option header, with the Type
   identifier for each Option calculated as the sum of its Option Delta
   field and the Type identifier of the preceding Option in the message,
   if any, or zero otherwise.

   Each option header includes a Length field which can be extended by
   an octet for options with values longer than 14 octets.  CoAP options
   include the concept of Critical (odd value) and Elective (even value)
   options (see Section 2.5.1).

   Each option has the following format:


         0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
       | option delta  |    length     | for 0..14

                                                  for 15..270:
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
       | option delta  | 1   1   1   1 |          length - 15          |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+


                      Figure 6: Header option format

   Option delta:  4-bit unsigned integer.  This field defines the
      difference between the option Type of this option and the previous
      option (or zero for the first option).  In other words, the Type
      identifier is calculated by simply summing the Option delta fields
      of this and previous options before it.  The Option Values 14, 28,
      ... are reserved for no-op options with no value (they are
      ignored) and are used for deltas larger than 14.  Thus these can
      be used as "fenceposts" if deltas larger than 15 would otherwise

      be required.

   Length:  Length Field.  Normally Length is a 4-bit unsigned integer
      allowing values of 0-14 octets.  When the length is 15 or more,
      another byte is added as an 8-bit unsigned integer plus 15
      allowing values of 15-270 octets.

   Option Value  The value in the format defined for that option in
      Table 2 of Length octets.  Options MAY use variable length values.

   The following options are defined in this document.  The Default
   column indicates the value to be assumed in the absence of this
   option (if any).

3.2.1.  Content-type Option

   The Content-type Identifier Option indicates the Internet media type
   identifier of the message-body, see Section 11.2 for the encoding and
   identifier tables.  A Content-type Identifier Option SHOULD be
   included if there is a payload included with a CoAP message.  In the
   absence of the Content-type Option the MIME type "text/plain" (0)
   MUST be assumed.  This option MUST be supported by all end-points.
   This option MUST NOT occur more than once in a header.

Internet-Draft   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)  September 2010


3.2.2.  Uri-Authority Option

   The Uri-Authority Option indicates the authority (host + port) part
   of a URI.  Examples of this option include "[2001:DB8::101]",
   "198.51.100.0:8000" and "sensor.example.com".  This option is used by
   servers to determine which resource to return and by intermediate
   components, e.g. when accessing a resource via a proxy.
   Section 2.5.2 specifies the rules for URIs in CoAP.  This option
   SHOULD be included in a request when the authority of the URI is
   known.  This option MUST be supported by an end-point implementing
   proxy functionality.  This option MUST NOT occur more than once in a
   header.

3.2.3.  Uri-Path Option

   The Uri-Path Option indicates the absolute path part of a URI.  One
   example of an absolute path in his option is "s/light".  In the
   absence of this option, the path is assumed to be "/".  Section 2.5.2
   specifies the rules for URIs in CoAP.  The leading slash is assumed
   and MUST be omitted.  This option MUST be supported by all end-
   points.  This option MUST NOT occur more than once in a header.

3.2.4.  Location Option

   The Location Option indicates the location of a resource as an
   absolute path URI and is similar to the Uri-Path Option.  The
   Location Option MAY be included in a response to indicate the
   Location of a new resource created with POST or together with a 30x
   response code.  The leading slash is assumed and MUST be omitted.
   This option MUST NOT occur more than once in a header.

3.2.5.  Max-age Option

   The Max-age Option indicates the maximum age of the resource for use
   in cache control in seconds.  The option value is represented as a
   variable length unsigned integer between 8 and 32 bits.  A default
   value of 60 seconds is assumed in the absence of this option.

   When included in a request, Max-age indicates the maximum age of a
   cached representation of that resource the client will accept.  When
   included in a response, Max-age indicates the maximum time the
   representation may be cached before it MUST be discarded.  This
   option MUST NOT occur more than once in a header.

3.2.6.  Etag Option

   The Etag Option is an opaque sequence of bytes which specifies the
   version of a resource representation.  An Etag may be generated for a



Shelby, et al.           Expires March 31, 2011                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)  September 2010


   resource in any number of ways including a version, checksum, hash or
   time.  An end-point receiving an Etag MUST treat it as opaque and
   make no assumptions about its format.  The Etag MAY be included in a
   response to indicate to a client if a resource has changed.  The Etag
   SHOULD be included in a request used for a cache refresh to indicate
   the client's current version of the resource (see Section 5.2).


4.  UDP Binding

   The CoAP protocol operates by default over UDP.  CoAP may also be
   used with Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) as described in
   Section 10.  CoAP could also be used over other transports such as
   TCP or SCTP, the specification of which is out of this document's
   scope.

   The goal of binding CoAP to UDP is to provide the bare minimum
   features for the protocol to operate over UDP, without trying to re-
   create the full feature set of a transport like TCP.  CoAP over UDP
   has the following features:

   o  Simple stop-and-wait retransmission reliability with exponential
      back-off as described in Section 4.2 for Confirmable messages.

   o  Transaction ID for response matching as described in
      Section 2.2.5.

   o  Multicast support as described in Section 4.1.

   The length of the Payload in a CoAP message is calculated from the
   datagram length.  While specific link layers make it beneficial to
   keep CoAP messages small enough to fit into their link layer packets
   (see Section 1), this is a matter of implementation quality.  The
   CoAP specification itself provides only an upper bound to the message
   size.  A CoAP message SHOULD fit within a single IP packet and MUST
   fit within a single IP datagram.  If the Path MTU is not known for a
   destination, an MTU of 1280 octets SHOULD be assumed.

4.1.  Multicast

   CoAP supports the use of multicast destination addresses.  Multicast
   messages SHOULD be Non-Confirmable.  If a Confirmable multicast
   message is sent then retransmission MUST NOT be performed.
   Furthermore, a destination end-point to a multicast Confirmable
   message MUST only send an Acknowledgment if the response code
   included indicates success (Code = 2XX) in order to eliminate error
   code response floods.  Other mechanisms for avoiding congestion from
   multicast requests are being considered in



Shelby, et al.           Expires March 31, 2011                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)  September 2010


   [I-D.eggert-core-congestion-control].

4.2.  Retransmission

   A CoAP end-point keeps track of open Confirmable messages it sent
   that are waiting for a response.  Each entry includes at least the
   destination IP address and port of the original message, the message
   itself, a retransmission counter and a timeout.  When a Confirmable
   is sent, an entry is made for that message with a default initial
   timeout of RESPONSE_TIMEOUT and the retransmission counter set to 0.
   When a matching Acknowledgment is received for an entry, the entry is
   invalidated.  When a timeout is triggered for an entry and the
   retransmission counter is less than MAX_RETRANSMIT, the original
   message is retransmitted to the destination without modification, the
   retransmission counter is incremented, and the timeout is doubled.
   If the retransmission counter reaches MAX_RETRANSMIT on a timeout,
   then the entry is removed and the application process informed of
   delivery failure.

   For CoAP messages sent to IP multicast addresses, retransmission MUST
   NOT be performed.  Therefore MAX_RETRANSMIT is always set to 0 when
   the destination address is multicast.

4.3.  Congestion Control

   In addition to the exponential back-off mechanism in Section 4.2,
   further congestion control optimizations are being considered and
   tested for CoAP.  These congestion control mechanism under
   consideration are described in [I-D.eggert-core-congestion-control].

4.4.  Default Port

   The CoAP default port number [IANA_TBD_PORT] MUST be supported by a
   server for resource discovery (see Section 6) and SHOULD be supported
   for providing access to other resources.  In addition other end-
   points may be hosted in the dynamic port space.

   When a CoAP server is hosted by a 6LoWPAN node, it SHOULD support a
   port in the 61616-61631 compressed UDP port space defined in
   [RFC4944].  The specific port number in use will be communicated in a
   URI and/or by some other discovery mechanism.


5.  Caching

   CoAP end-points are by definition constrained by bandwidth and
   processing power.  To optimize the performance of data transfer under

   Caching includes the following concepts:

   o  Cache life of a resource is controlled via the Max-Age header
      option

   o  Cache refresh and versioning of a resource is controlled via the
      Etag header option

   o  Proxies between a client and end-point may participate in the
      caching process on behalf of sleeping end-points and to avoid
      unnecessary traffic on the constrained network

5.1.  Cache control

   When an end-point responds to a GET request by sending a
   representation of the resource, it SHOULD specify the Max-Age header
   option.  The Max-Age specifies the cache life of the resource in
   seconds.  Resources which change rapidly will have a short cache
   life, and resources which change infrequently should specify a long
   cache life.  If Max-Age is unspecified in a GET response, then it is
   assumed to be 60 seconds.  If an end-point wishes to disable caching,
   it must explicitly specify a Max-Age of zero seconds.

   When a client reads the response from a GET request, it should cache
   the resource representation for the cache lifetime as specified by
   the Max-Age header.  During the cache lifetime, the client SHOULD use
   its cached version and avoid performing additional GETs for the
   resource.

   In general, the origin server end-point is responsible for
   determining cache age.  However, in some cases a client may wish to
   determine its own tolerance for cache staleness.  In this case, a
   client may specify the Max-Age header during a GET request.  If the
   client's Max-Age is of a shorter duration than the age of a cached
   resource, then the proxy or end-point SHOULD perform a cache refresh.
   If the client specifies a Max-Age of zero seconds, then the response
   MUST discard the cached representation and return a fresh
   representation.

5.2.  Cache refresh

   After the expiration of the cache lifetime, clients and proxies can
   refresh their cached representation of a resource.  Cache refresh is
   accomplished using a GET request which will return a representation
   of the resource's current state.

   If the end-point has the capability to version the resource, then the
   end-point should include the Etag header option in the response to a

Internet-Draft   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)  September 2010


   GET request.  The Etag is a variable length sequence of bytes which
   captures a version identifier of the resource.  The Etag is an opaque
   identifier; clients MUST NOT infer any semantics from the Etag value.

   If an end-point specifies the Etag header option with a response,
   then the client SHOULD specify a matching Etag header option in their
   GET request during cache refresh.  If the end-point's version of the
   resource is unmodified, then the server SHOULD return a 304 response
   with no payload to avoid retransmitting the resource representation.

5.3.  Proxying

   A proxy is defined as a CoAP end-point which services cached requests
   on behalf of other CoAP end-points.  Any node in a CoAP network may
   act as a proxy, although in general the node between the constrained
   network and the Internet at large SHOULD always support proxy
   functionality.

   Proxies should be used under the following scenarios:

   o  Clients external to the constrained network SHOULD always make
      requests through a proxy to limit traffic on the constrained
      network

   o  Clients internal to the constrained network MAY use a proxy based
      on network topology when performance warrants

   o  Clients of sleeping devices MUST use a proxy to access resources
      while the device is sleeping

   Proxy requests are made as normal CON requests to the proxy end-
   point.  All proxy requests MUST use the Uri-Authority header to
   indicate the origin server's IP address using the URI format defined
   by RFC 3986:


     full uri  = "coap://" + authority + path
     authority = host [ ":" port ]
     host      = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name
                 (as defined by RFC 3986)
     port      = *DIGIT


   The host part is case insensitive and may be an IPv4 literal, IPv6
   literal in square brackets, or a registered name.  The port number is
   optional, if omitted or zero-length it is assumed to be the default
   CoAP port (see Section 4.4).

Internet-Draft   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)  September 2010


   When a request is made to a proxy, then the following steps are
   taken:

      1.  If the authority (host and port) is recognized as identifying
      the proxy end-point, then the request MUST be treated as a local
      request and the path part is used as Uri-Path

      2.  If the proxy does not contain a fresh cached representation of
      the resource, then the proxy MUST attempt to refresh its cache
      according to section 5.2.  The origin server's IP address and port
      is determined by the authority part of the full URI.  The Uri-Path
      option for the refresh request is determined by the path part of
      the full URI.

      3.  If the proxy fails to obtain a fresh cached representation,
      then a 502 Bad Gateway error code MUST be returned

      4.  The proxy returns the cached representation on behalf of the
      origin server

   All CoAP options are considered end-to-end and MUST be stored as part
   of the cache entry and MUST be transmitted in the proxy's response.
   The Max-Age option should be adjusted by the proxy for each response
   using the formula: proxy-max-age = original-max-age - cache-age.  For
   example if a request is made to a proxied resource that was refreshed
   20sec ago and had an original Max-Age of 60sec, then that resource's
   proxied Max-Age is now 40sec.


6.  Resource Discovery

   The discovery of resources offered by a CoAP end-point is extremely
   important in machine-to-machine applications where there are no
   humans in the loop and static interfaces result in fragility.  A CoAP
   end-point SHOULD support the CoRE Link Format of discoverable
   resources as described in (REF).


7.  HTTP Mapping

   CoAP supports a limited subset of HTTP functionality, and thus a
   mapping to HTTP is straightforward.  There might be several reasons
   for mapping between CoAP and HTTP, for example when designing a web
   interface for use over either protocol or when realizing a CoAP-HTTP
   proxy.  Likewise, CoAP could equally be mapped to other protocols
   such as XMPP or SIP, the definition of which is out of scope.

   The mapping of CoAP to HTTP is a straightforward conversion of the



Shelby, et al.           Expires March 31, 2011                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)  September 2010


   CoAP method or response code, content-type and options to the
   corresponding HTTP feature.  The payload is carried in an equivalent
   way by both protocols.  The mapping of HTTP to CoAP requires checking
   for methods, response codes, options and content-types that are not
   supported by CoAP.  A mapping SHOULD attempt to map options, response
   codes and content-types to a suitable alternative if possible.
   Otherwise the unsupported feature SHOULD be silently dropped if
   possible, or an appropriate error code generated otherwise.

   The caching and proxying of CoAP is specified in Section 5.  In a
   similar manner, caching and proxying MAY be performed between CoAP
   and HTTP by an intermediate node.  A proxy SHOULD respond with a 502
   (Bad Gateway) error to HTTP requests which can not be successfully
   mapped to CoAP.  CoAP transaction messages are transparent to
   request/response exchanges and MUST have no affect on a proxy
   function.


8.  Protocol Constants

   This section defines the relevant protocol constants defined in this
   document:

   RESPONSE_TIMEOUT                        1 second

   MAX_RETRANSMIT                          5


9.  Examples

   Figure 7 shows a basic request sequence.  A client makes a
   Confirmable GET request for the resource /temperature to the server
   with a Transaction ID of 1234.  The request includes one Uri-Path
   Option (delta 0 + 9 = 9) "temperature" of Len = 11.  This request is
   a total of 16 octets long.  The corresponding Acknowledgment is of
   Code 200 OK and includes a Payload of "22.3 C".  The Transaction ID
   is 1234, thus the transaction is successfully completed.  The
   response is 10 octets long and a Content-type of 0 (text/plain) is
   assumed as there is no Content-type Option.

10.  Security Considerations

   This section describes mechanisms that can be used to secure CoAP and
   analyzes the possible threats to the protocol and its limitations.
   Security bootstrapping (setting up keys) in constrained environments
   is considered in [I-D.oflynn-core-bootstrapping].

10.1.  Securing CoAP with IPSec

   One mechanism to secure CoAP in constrained environments is the IPsec
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC2406].  Using IPsec ESP with
   the appropriate configuration it is possible for many constrained
   devices to support encryption with built-in link-layer encryption
   hardware, for example most IEEE 802.15.4 radio chips are compatible
   with AES-CBC (with 128-bit keys) [RFC3602] as defined for use with
   IPsec in [RFC4835].  When using IPsec to secure CoAP, both
   authentication and confidentiality SHOULD be applied as recommended
   in [RFC2406].  The use of IPsec between CoAP end-points is
   transparent to the application layer and does not require special
   consideration for a CoAP implementation.

   IPsec may not be appropriate for all environments.  For example,
   IPsec support is not available for many embedded IP stacks and even
   in full PC operating systems or on backend web servers, application



Shelby, et al.           Expires March 31, 2011                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)  September 2010


   developers may not have sufficient access to configure or enable
   IPsec or to add a security gateway to the infrastructure.  Problems
   with firewalls and NATs may furthermore limit the use of IPsec.

10.2.  Securing CoAP with DTLS

   Just as HTTP may be secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) over
   TCP, CoAP may be secured using Datagram TLS (DTLS) [RFC4347] over
   UDP.  This section describes how to secure CoAP with DTLS , along
   with the minimal configurations appropriate for constrained
   environments.  DTLS is in practice TLS with added features to deal
   with the unreliable nature of the UDP transport.

   In some constrained nodes (limited flash and/or RAM) and networks
   (limited bandwidth or high scalability requirements) DTLS may not be
   applicable.  The protocol is an order of magnitude more complex than
   CoAP and has appreciable handshake overhead needed to maintain
   security sessions.  DTLS makes sense for applications where the
   session maintenance makes is compatible with application flows and
   sufficient resources are available on the constrained nodes and for
   the added network overhead.

   As with IPSec, DTLS should be configured with a cypher suite
   compatible with any possible hardware engine on the node, for example
   AES-CBC in the case of IEEE 802.15.4.  Implementations MUST support
   the mandatory to implement cipher suite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
   as specified in [RFC5246].

10.3.  Threat analysis and protocol limitations

   This section is meant to inform protocol and application developers
   about the security limitations of CoAP as described in this document.
   As CoAP realizes a subset of the features in HTTP/1.1, the security
   considerations in Section 15 of [RFC2616] are also pertinent to CoAP.
   This section concentrates on describing limitations specific to CoAP
   and CoRE.

   be used in well-known port and service discovery registrations.

   [IANA_TBD_PORT] Apply for a well-known port number in the 0-1023
   space as CoAP end-points are usually executed by an operating system
   or root process. http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers

   [IANA_TBD_MIME] A new registry is required for the Internet MIME type
   identifier space for CoAP as described in Section 11.2.

11.1.  Codes

   CoAP makes use of (a subset of) the HTTP status codes defined in
   [RFC2616].  The HTTP status code is encoded into an 8-bit unsigned
   integer code with the mapping defined in Table 3.  The use of these
   codes is defined throughout this document using the HTTP Name.

   "application" and a sub-type "xml" [RFC2046].  In order to minimize
   the overhead of using these media types to indicate the type of
   message payload, CoAP defines an identifier encoding scheme for a
   subset of Internet media types.  It is expected that this table of
   identifiers will be extensible and maintained by IANA for values of
   0-200 [IANA_TBD_MIME].

   The Content-type Option is formatted as an 8-bit unsigned integer.
   Initial mappings from Internet media types to a suitable identifier
   is shown in Table 4.  Composite high-level types (multipart and
   message) are not supported.  Identifier values from 201-255 are
   reserved for vendor specific, application specific or experimental
   use and are not maintained by IANA.
