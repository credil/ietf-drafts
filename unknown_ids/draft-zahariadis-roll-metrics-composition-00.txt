1  Introduction

   Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have specific routing
   requirements, as described in [RFC5548], [RFC5673], [RFC5826], and
   [RFC5867]. In these RFCs, several (and sometimes contradicting)
   requirements are set by each application domain. In order to cope
   with them, a number of routing metrics and constraints has been
   spelled out in [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics], consisting of
   link/node, qualitative/quantitative, static/dynamic metrics and
   constraints. According to [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], these metrics and
   constraints are carried in objects that are OPTIONAL within RPL
   messages.

   Path computation algorithms for single metrics have already been
   proposed and used in current Internet Drafts [I-D.ietf-roll-OF0], [I-
   D.gnawali-roll-etxof], and [I-D.gnawali-roll-minrank-hysteresis-of].

   For providing Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing in future
   applications, the Objective Function (OF) and Rank value might be
   built upon a composite metric, consisting of several basic metrics,
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics].

   The intention of this document is to set the guidelines for the
   proper selection of basic metrics as well as the design of composite
   routing metrics for LLNs, taking into consideration the theoretical
   framework of [Sobrinho], as refined by [Yang]. Thus, the main target
   of this document is to examine the properties that routing metrics
   must hold to provide consistency, optimality and loop-freeness for
   the RPL routing protocol. In this way, each node will select the
   shortest path (or shortest constraint path, in the presence of
   constraints).

   The document does not intend to provide one composite metric that
   fits all cases, but rather to sketch out the guidelines for designing
   appropriate composite metrics, in line with specific application
   requirements.

   The effectiveness and performance of composite metrics used for IP
   performance evaluation is beyond the scope of this document and can
   be found in [RFC2330], [RFC5835] and [RFC6049].

   The purpose of this document is to provide a common framework for
   various classes of metrics that are composed of basic metrics.

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the concepts of [I-
   D.ietf-roll-rpl] and [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics].

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   This document makes use of the terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-
   terminology]. Apart from [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology], this document
   defines the following terms, in accordance with [RFC5835]
   terminology:


   basic metric: a metric governed by specific rules and properties,
              capturing specific link or node characteristics. Examples
              of basic metrics are hop-count, ETX, LQL, etc.

   derived metric: a metric that is defined in terms of a basic metric,
              retaining the properties and rules of the basic metric.
              For example, (1-(1/ETX)) is an ETX derived metric, since
              it retains the rules and properties of the basic metric
              (ETX).

   composite metric: is defined as a routing metric consisting of
              several basic or/and derived metrics by applying a
              deterministic process or function (composition function).

   composition function: a deterministic process applied to primary
              and/or derived metrics to derive a composite metric.

   optimal path: is defined as a path in the DAG that minimizes (or
              maximizes, respectively) the Rank value between any given
              pair of source-destination nodes.

   sub-path: is defined as any portion of the path traversed between any
              given pair of source-destination nodes.

   path weight: a value representing link or/and node characteristics of
              a path. This definition coincides with 'path cost' defined
              in [I-D.ietf-roll-minrank-hysteresis-of]. Path weight is
              used by RPL to compare different paths.

   metric order relation: is used for weight comparison of paths with
              the same source and destination nodes, leading to the next
              hop neighbor selection. For example: '>' (greater than) is
              an order relation.

   metric operator: is used for the transformation of link weights and
              node characteristics into path weights. As an example,
              addition ( + ) is defined as a metric operator.

1.2  Motivation

   Different metrics are defined to capture different link and node
   characteristics of a path. For example, some metrics capture network
   latency, some others take into account the energy consumption of a
   node, while others focus on link reliability. The diversity of RPL
   routing protocol application domains, as described in [RFC5548],
   [RFC5673], [RFC5826], and [RFC5867] motivate the design of different
   composite routing metrics to cope with different routing application
   requirements.

   However, the selection of basic and derived metrics to design an
   efficient composite metric is neither an arbitrary nor a trivial
   task.

   Combining routing metrics of different types may lead to routing
   loops or selection of non-optimal paths.

   This document presents the guidelines for designing QoS routing
   strategies set by different applications, by identifying the
   properties that a composite metric must hold in order to work
   seamlessly with RPL routing protocol.

2  Basic and Derived Metrics Properties and Rules

   Routing metrics are the representation of an LLN in routing process.
   Thus, they might result in major implications on the complexity of
   optimal path computation, the existence of optimal path and the range
   of application requirements that can be supported.

   Path computation algorithms using a basic metric have been widely
   used in the literature and practice [I-D.ietf-roll-of0], [I-D.ietf-
   roll-etxof], [I-D.ietf-roll-minrank-hysteresis-of]. However, in order
   to support a wide range of QoS requirements dictated by different
   application domains, several routing metric forming a composite
   metric must be taken into account.

   RPL is a distance vector based, hop-by-hop routing protocol that
   builds Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) based on routing metrics and
   constraints. Following the routing algebra formalism presented in
   [Sobrinho] and refined in [Yang], routing metrics must hold specific
   properties, namely isotonicity and monotonicity, in order to fulfil
   routing protocol requirements (consistency, optimality, loop-
   freeness).

   In the following sections, basic metrics are examined and categorized
   according to their properties and rules. This exercise will provide
   useful information for the composition of efficient composite

Internet Draftdraft-zahariadis-roll-metrics-composition-00July 2011


   metrics.

2.1  Metric Domain

   Basic metrics are defined in different domains. For example, hop-
   count has the value of 1 per-hop, while ETX is defined in [1,
   +infinity) and LQL from 0 to 7, where 0 means undetermined and 1
   indicates the highest link quality. Intuitively, the selection of the
   basic metrics to derive a composite metric MUST take into account the
   domain of each one of the basic metrics selected. This can be
   achieved by defining derived metrics, as will be explained later in
   this document. 

2.2  Aggregation Rules

   According to [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics], a metric can either be
   recorded or aggregated along the path. In the former case, the metric
   can be of maximum type (A=0x01) or minimum type (A=0x02), while in
   the latter case, a metric can be of additive type (A=0x00) or
   multiplicative type (A=0x03).

   Let m(i,r) be the metric value for link and node characteristics
   between nodes i and r. Then, for any path p from node i to node r, we
   define that: 

   a metric is additive if: m(p)=m(i,j)+m(j,k)+...+m(q,r),

   a metric is multiplicative if: m(p)=m(i,j)*m(j,k)*...*m(q,r),

   a metric is concave if: m(p)=max[m(i,j),m(j,k),...,m(q,r)] or
   m(p)=min[m(i,j),m(j,k),...,m(q,r)].

   In most of the cases, basic metrics are aggregated along the path,
   indicating end-to-end characteristics of the network. This
   categorization is related to metric operator.

   Metrics differ in the aggregation rule they follow. As an example,
   hop-count and ETX are additive metrics, while RSSI is a
   multiplicative metric. 

   Moreover, the concave metrics are recorded (and not aggregated) along
   the path.

   Examples taken from routing schemes in IP networks that make use of
   concave metrics are 'widest-shortest' and 'shortest-widest' path
   calculation metrics.

   Thus, the composite metric must also take into account the
 


Zahariadis, et al.      Expires January 30, 2012                [Page 6]

Internet Draftdraft-zahariadis-roll-metrics-composition-00July 2011


   aggregation rules of the selected primary metrics.

2.3  Metric Order Relation

   Another categorization of basic metrics is derived from the fact that
   some are 'maximizable' (the higher value, the better) while others
   are 'minimizable' (the lower value, the better). For example, a node
   selects for routing a neighboring node (DODAG parent) that advertises
   (DIO) the minimum hop-count (or aggregated ETX) value to reach DAG
   root node. On the other hand, if the Objective Function is based on
   RSSI (or throughput) values, then the maximum value will lead the
   process of the DODAG parent selection.

   In Figure 1, the properties and rules for some of the well-known
   primary metrics used in LLNs are presented.

3  Composition Metrics Requirements

   As discussed in the previous section and supported by [Sobrinho] and
   [Yang], the selection of the basic routing metrics for designing a
   composite metric is not straightforward for the routing solution to
   lead to fulfil routing protocol requirements (consistency,
   optimality, loop-freeness). In this section the composition metrics
   requirements will be examined, followed by explanatory text or
   representative examples, to guide prospective routing protocol
   designs and implementations. 

   - Metrics MUST be well-defined. 

   For applying an efficient composite metric, all basic or derived
   metrics must be well-defined. The use of new or not thoroughly tested
 


Zahariadis, et al.      Expires January 30, 2012                [Page 7]

Internet Draftdraft-zahariadis-roll-metrics-composition-00July 2011


   basic metrics MUST be avoided.

   - Metrics MUST reflect the basic characteristics of LLNs.

   Each network has its own unique characteristics. As an example, a
   fundamental concern in ad-hoc networks consists on link reliability
   and node mobility, while in IP networks, bandwidth and latency are of
   great importance. LLNs are no exception. The resource constraints of
   such networks demand primarily for energy conservation, link
   instabilities and (in some applications) heavy traffic load. Thus,
   the basic metrics selected for defining a composite metric must be
   analyzed towards capturing the fundamental characteristics of LLNs.

   - Metrics MUST be orthogonal and not antagonistic. 

   Orthogonality means that no correlated information is carried within
   different basic metrics. As an example, the use of RSSI and LQL for
   metric composition MUST be avoided, since they capture the same LLN
   characteristic; link reliability. 

   Moreover, the use of antagonistic metrics must be avoided. As
   antagonistic metrics can be defined metrics that eliminate the
   effects of one another.

   - Metrics MUST exhibit continuity.

   That is, small variations in metric values, MUST result in small
   variations in the composite metric value. This requirement is more
   related to derived metrics. Special attention must be paid so that
   the derived metrics do not produce instabilities and inconsistencies.

   - Metrics MUST be scalable.

   A composite metric must be able to scale to large LLNs. This
   requirement is relevant to path computation complexity, since the
   complexity of the path computation is determined by the composition
   rules of the metric. Especially in LLNs, this requirement is of
   importance, taking into account that the computational power of LLN
   nodes is constrained.

   - Metrics must have known and identified sources of inaccuracies and
   measurement uncertainties.

   Most of the basic metrics are prone to inaccuracies. A representative
   example is LQL, as defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics]. In
   other words, when such metrics are used, the sources of inaccuracies
   must be, at least, identified.

 


Zahariadis, et al.      Expires January 30, 2012                [Page 8]

Internet Draftdraft-zahariadis-roll-metrics-composition-00July 2011


   - Metrics MUST follow the same properties and rules.

   As described above, the combination of metrics retaining different
   properties may lead to routing instabilities and selection of non-
   optimal paths. It is RECOMMENDED that basic routing metrics with
   different properties are transformed to derived metrics holding the
   same properties in order to be used for metric composition. For
   example, in case that ETX is used in conjunction to the node
   remaining energy (defined as RE =Enow/Emax), then a derived metric
   must be used for remaining energy (such as 1/RE). With this
   transformation, both metrics are additive, they share the same domain
   and are both 'minimizable'.

   - Metrics MUST be normalized.

   In case that an additive composite metric is used in conjunction with
   weighting factors for providing better QoS characteristics according
   to different applications, normalization of basic or derived metrics
   MUST take place. In the previous example, a composite metric
   (consisting of ETX and RE) could be defined as: a1*(1-(1/ETX))+a2*(1-
   RE). In this case, both derived metrics are defined in [0,1), are
   additive and 'minimizable'.Furthermore, if RSSI participates in the
   composite metric, then RSSI must become an additive metric by
   applying the logarithmic properties and then used in the form of the
   following derived metric: a3*(1/log(RSSI)).

   - Composite metric MUST hold isotonic and monotonic properties.

   Monotonicity means that the path weight strictly increases when
   prefixed or suffixed by another path. If the algebra is monotonic,
   then convergence of the routing protocol is ensured.

   Moreover, the isotonicity property essentially means that a routing
   metric should ensure that the order of the weights of two paths is
   preserved if they are appended or prefixed by a common third path. If
   the algebra is isotonic, then the paths onto which routing protocols
   converge are optimal.

4  Applicability to RPL

   According to [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], Objective Function (OF) defines how
   routing metrics, optimization objectives and related functions are
   used to compute Rank. Furthermore, OF dictates how parents in the
   DODAG are selected and thus the DODAG formation is defined by OF.

   On the other hand, Rank defines the node's individual position
   relative to other nodes with respect to a DODAG root. Rank strictly
   increases in the Down direction (towards leaf nodes) and strictly
 


Zahariadis, et al.      Expires January 30, 2012                [Page 9]

Internet Draftdraft-zahariadis-roll-metrics-composition-00July 2011


   decreases in the Up direction (towards root node). The exact way Rank
   is computed, depends on the DAG's OF, as mentioned earlier.

   Furthermore, according to [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], minHopRankIncrease
   value is defined as the minimum increase in Rank between a node and
   any of its DODAG parents, while maxRankIncrease is defined as the
   maximum value increase that a given node can advertise within the
   same DODAG version.

   There are two distinct approaches to follow, regarding the usability
   of multiple basic or derived routing metrics into one composite
   metric in a routing protocol, namely the lexical metric composition
   and the additive metric composition.

4.1  Lexical Metric Composition

   According to the lexical metric composition approach, when comparing
   two composite metric values, the node will select as a DODAG parent
   the node with the lower value of the first component, and if the
   first component values are equal (or differ less than a predefined
   threshold) then it will select the one with the lower value of the
   second composite metric component. Some examples of well-known
   composite lexical metrics used in IP networks are 'widest-shortest'
   path, that selects the widest path among the set of shortest paths
   between the source and the destination node, and 'most reliable-
   shortest' path, that selects the most reliable path among the set of
   shortest paths.

   This is totally in line with the "Prec" field carried within the DAG
   Metric Container Object defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] and [I-
   D.ietf.roll-routing-metrics] that indicates the precedence of each
   routing metric (or constraint) present in the Objective Function.

4.2  Additive Metric Composition

   According to the additive metric composition, the Rank is evaluated
   based on a defined OF (composition function) and advertised through
   the DIO message. Moreover, the values of the basic metrics are
   aggregated along the path and are included in the DAG Metric
   Container Object.

   This approach is also compatible with RPL specifications, since
   according to [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics], in this case the
   relevant flags of the DAG Metric Container Object must be: C = 0, O =
   0, A = 0x00, and R = 0.

   As explained in this document, the composition of several basic or
   derived routing metrics into a composite routing metric is a
   challenging problem.

   Thus, the goal of this document is to describe the framework for
   routing metrics composition properties and mechanisms, providing
   guidelines for the proper selection and composition of basic metrics
   into composite metrics for applicability to RPL routing protocol.

   This has been achieved by examining issues related to composing a
   routing metric, subject to multiple basic metrics and constraints.

6  Security Considerations

   No new considerations are raised by this document.

7  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.
