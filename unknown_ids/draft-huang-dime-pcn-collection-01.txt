Abstract

   Pre-Congestion notification (PCN) is a technique for maintaining QoS
   for inelastic flows in a DIFFServ domain.  The PCN architecture
   requires that egress nodes send reports of congestion-related events
   (flow admission state change, excess flow) reliably to a policy
   decision point.  The ITU-T is working on a variant of this
   architecture which places the policy decision point in a central node
   rather than ingress or egress nodes of the network.  In this case the
   policy decision point must request and obtain certain data from an
   ingress node when it receives an excess flow report affecting that
   ingress node.  This memo defines a Diameter application to support
   egress node reporting and data collection from the ingress node.  The
   nature of the data flows requires the policy decision point to act
   both as server and as client.  Hence this memo draws upon the
   precedent established by the Rw application (RFC 5431 and ITU-T
   Recommendation Q.3303.3).

1.  Introduction

   The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
   quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain
   [RFC2475] in a simple, scalable and robust fashion.  Two mechanisms
   are used: admission control, to decide whether to admit or block a
   new flow request, and (in abnormal circumstances) flow termination to
   decide whether to terminate some of the existing flows.  Together
   they protect the QoS of previously admitted flows.  To achieve this,
   the overall rate of the PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the
   PCN-domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain
   configured rates are exceeded.  These configured rates are below the
   rate of the link thus providing notification before any congestion
   occurs ("pre-congestion notification").  The level of marking allows
   decisions to be made about whether to admit or terminate.  For a full
   description of the PCN architecture, see [RFC5559].

   Marking statistics are gathered by egress nodes on a per-ingress-
   egress aggregate basis.  They are processed to determine whether new
   flows can be admitted to the aggregate over the next measurement
   interval and whether some flows should be terminated to protect QoS
   for the remainder (flow termination is expected to be relatively
   infrequent, typically a result of network failure).  The admission
   state is based on a congestion level estimate (CLE), which the egress
   node reports to a decision point whenever the CLE value passes a set
   threshold (upward or downward).  The decision to terminate flows is
   made on the basis of a different criterion.  When the egress node
   detects that this criterion has been satisfied, it sends a report to
   the decision node providing measurement values that are used to
   determine the total volume of traffic that must be terminated.  If
   equal cost multipath (ECMP) routing is in use, it also sends a list
   of individual flows that were marked at the termination level.


2.  Related Work

   The ITU-T is doing work to exploit the PCN technology in an
   environment where the decisions are made by a central policy decision
   point (PDP) [Q.3303.3], which needs the information generated by PCN
   marking to support per-flow decisions on admission and termination.
   This memo defines a Diameter application to transfer the information
   from edge nodes to the PDP.  Egress node reports are sent by the
   egress node acting as client to the PDP acting as server.  Data
   generated at the ingress node are needed only when flow termination
   is required.  They are requested by the PDP acting as client and sent
   in responses by the ingress node acting as server.  The PDP thus acts
   both as client and as server in the same application.  The Rw
   application [RFC5431] provides a precedent for such an application.

Internet-Draft             PCN Data Collection                 July 2009


   The PCN Data Collection application is related to existing ITU-T
   applications as follows:

   o  The Rs application allows application-level functions to request
      flow admission for individual application flows.

   o  The Rw application provides the control linkage between a Policy
      Decision Point and an ingress router, to pass down decisions on
      flow admission following either the push or the pull model.  The
      Rw application also passes flow termination decisions.

   As can be seen from this brief description, the PCN Data Collection
   application defined in this memo is complementary to the Rw
   application.  Within the strict terms of the ITU-T architecture, it
   is a realization of a different interface, the Rc interface.
   However, the PCN Data Collection application is intended for use in
   any of a number of architectures based on a centralized policy
   decision element.


3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.  The Diameter PCN Data Collection Application

4.1.  Advertising Application Support

   Clients, servers, and proxies supporting the PCN Data Collection
   application MUST advertise support by including the value <AID> in
   the Auth-Application-Id of Congestion-Report-Request (CRR),
   Congestion-Report-Answer (CRA), Measurement-Poll-Request (MPR), and
   Measurement-Poll-Answer (MPA) messages.

4.2.  Diameter Session Usage

   Diameter sessions are implicitly terminated.  An implicitly
   terminated session is one for which the server does not maintain
   state information.  The client does not need to send any re-
   authorization or session termination requests to the server.  The
   Diameter base protocol includes the Auth-Session-State AVP as the
   mechanism for the implementation of implicitly terminated sessions.
   The client (server) SHALL include in its requests (responses) the
   Auth-Session-State AVP set to the value NO_STATE_MAINTAINED (1), as
   described in RFC 3588 [RFC3588].  As a consequence, the server does

   not maintain any state information about this session and the client
   does not need to send any session termination request.  Neither the
   Authorization-Lifetime AVP nor the Session-Timeout AVP SHALL be
   present in requests or responses.

4.3.  Commands

   The PCN Data Collection application defines four new commands,
   Congestion-Report-Request(CRR), Congestion-Report-Answer(CRA),
   Measurement-Poll-Request (MPR) and Measurement-Poll-Answer (MPA).

4.3.1.  Congestion-Report-Request (CRR) Command

   The egress node sends the Congestion-Report-Request (CRR) command,
   indicated by the Command-Code field set to <CC1> and the Command
   Flags' 'R' bit set, to report when the congestion level estimate
   (CLE) moves above or drops below the pre-congestion reporting
   threshold, or when an excess flow condition is detected.  Multiple
   reports MAY be included in the same message, as described in
   Section 4.5.2.

   Message format:

     <CRR> ::= < Diameter Header: CC1, REQ, PXY >
               < Session-Id >
               { Auth-Application-Id }
               { Auth-Session-State }
               { Origin-Host }
               { Origin-Realm }
               { Destination-Realm }
               [ Destination-Host ]
               [ Event-Timestamp ]
             * [ PCN-Congestion-Info ]
             * [ PCN-Excess-Flow-Info ]
             * [ Proxy-Info ]
             * [ Route-Record ]
             * [ AVP ]

   At least one instance of the PCN-Congestion-Info or the PCN-Excess-
   Flow-Info AVP MUST be present; the value of the Session-Id AVP MUST
   be unique and SHOULD be set according to the recommendations in
   Section 8.8 of RFC 3588.

4.3.2.  Congestion-Report-Answer (CRA) Command

   The PDP uses the Congestion-Report-Answer (CRA) command, indicated by
   the Command-Code field set to <CC2> and the Command Flags' 'R' bit
   cleared, to acknowledge an Congestion-Report-Request command sent by

   an egress node.  The Congestion-Report-Answer command contains the
   same Session-Id as the corresponding request.

   Message format:

     <CRA> ::= < Diameter Header: CC2, PXY >
               < Session-Id >
               { Auth-Application-Id }
               { Auth-Session-State }
               { Result-Code }
               { Origin-Host }
               { Origin-Realm }
               [ Error-Message ]
               [ Error-Reporting-Host ]
               [ Failed-AVP ]
               [ Event-Timestamp ]
             * [ Proxy-Info ]
             * [ AVP ]

4.3.3.  Measurement-Poll-Request (MPR) Command

   The PDP sends the Measurement-Poll-Request (MPR) command, indicated
   by the Command-Code field set to <CC3> and the Command Flags' 'R' bit
   set, to request that an ingress node report the rate at which PCN-
   marked traffic has been forwarded to a given ingress-egress
   aggregate, measured over a given measurement period as described in
   Section 4.5.4.  The value of the Session-Id AVP MUST be unique and
   SHOULD be set according to the recommendations in Section 8.8 of RFC
   3588.

   Message format:

     <MPR> ::= < Diameter Header: CC3, REQ, PXY >
               < Session-Id >
               { Auth-Application-Id }
               { Auth-Session-State }
               { Origin-Host }
               { Origin-Realm }
               { Destination-Realm }
               { I-E-Aggregate-Id }
               [ Destination-Host ]
               [ Event-Timestamp ]
             * [ Proxy-Info ]
             * [ Route-Record ]
             * [ AVP ]

4.3.4.  Measurement-Poll-Answer (MPA) Command

   The ingress node sends the Measurement-Poll-Answer (MPA) command,
   indicated by the Command-Code field set to <CC4> and the Command
   Flags' 'R' bit cleared, in response to an MPR sent by the PDP.

   Message format:

     <MPA> ::= < Diameter Header: CC4, PXY >
               < Session-Id >
               { Auth-Application-Id }
               { Auth-Session-State }
               { Result-Code }
               { Origin-Host }
               { Origin-Realm }
               { PCN-Sent-Info }
               [ Error-Message ]
               [ Error-Reporting-Host ]

               [ Event-Timestamp ]
             * [ Proxy-Info ]
             * [ AVP ]

4.4.  Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs)

   This section describes the AVPs specific to the PCN Data Collection
   application.  The 'M' bit MUST be set and the 'V' bit MUST NOT be set
   for all of these AVPs when used in the PCN Data Collection
   application.

4.4.1.  I-E-Aggregate-Id AVP

   The I-E-Aggregate-Id AVP (AVP code <AVP1>) is of type UTF8String.  It
   identifies a specific ingress-egress aggregate flow.  The internal
   structure of the I-E-Aggregate-Id value is network dependent.

4.4.2.  PCN-Congestion-Info AVP

   The PCN-Congestion-Info AVP (AVP code <AVP2>) is of type Grouped.  It
   identifies an ingress-egress aggregate, reports the current value of
   the congestion level estimate (CLE), and indicates whether the report
   is generated because the CLE has risen above the reporting threshold
   or because it has fallen below the reporting threshold.

   The PCN-Congestion-Info AVP has the following format:

     PCN-Congestion-Info ::= < AVP Header: AVP2 >
                                   { I-E-Aggregate-Id }
                                   { CLE-Value }
                                   { CLE-Report-Reason }
                                 * [ AVP ]

4.4.3.  CLE-Value AVP

   The CLE-Value AVP (AVP code <AVP3>) is of type Float32.  It gives the
   current (smoothed) congestion level estimate as a fraction between
   0.0 and 1.0.

4.4.4.  CLE-Report-Reason AVP

   The CLE-Report-Reason AVP (AVP code <AVP4>) is of type Enumerated.
   The following values are defined in this document:

   PRECONGESTION_ONSET (0)
      The current CLE (reported in CLE-Value) is above the configured
      onset reporting threshold.  The CLE derived in the previous
      measurement period was below that threshold.

   PRECONGESTION_END (1)  The current CLE (reported in CLE-Value) is
      below the configured end-of-precongestion reporting threshold,
      which may have the same value as the onset reporting threshold.
      The CLE derived in the previous measurement period was above that
      threshold.

4.4.5.  PCN-Excess-Flow-Info AVP

   The PCN-Excess-Flow-Info AVP (AVP code <AVP5>) is of type Grouped.
   It identifies an ingress-egress aggregate, reports a rate of excess
   traffic for that aggregate, and MAY identify a number of individual
   flows within that aggregate that experienced the markings that led to
   the generation of the PCN-Excess-Flow-Info AVP.  Precise details of
   the conditions under which this AVP is generated and how the
   individual flows are selected are given in the specification for the
   PCN edge behavior deployed in the domain.

   The PCN-Excess-Flow-Info AVP has the following format:

     PCN-Excess-Flow-Info ::= < AVP Header: AVP5 >
                                { I-E-Aggregate-Id }

4.4.6.  I-E-Aggregate-Excess-Rate AVP

   The I-E-Aggregate-Excess-Rate AVP (AVP code <AVP6>) is of type
   Unsigned32.  It gives the rate of flow of excess traffic in octets
   per second that the egress node derived for the identified ingress-
   egress aggregate for the measurement period ending at the time given
   by the Event-Timestamp AVP (if present).

4.4.7.  Flow-Number AVP

   The Flow-Number AVP (Vendor code 10415, AVP code 509)
   [ETSI-TS-129-209-V6.7.0] is of type Unsigned32, and it contains the
   ordinal number of the IP flow(s).  The rules for how the ordinal
   number should be assigned are not described in this document.

4.4.8.  Flow-Description AVP

   The Flow-Description AVP (Vendor code 10415, AVP code 507)
   [ETSI-TS-129-209-V6.7.0] is of type IPFilterRule, and defines a
   packet filter for an IP flow with the following information:

   o  Direction (in or out).

   o  Source and destination IP address (possibly masked).

   o  Protocol.

   o  Source and destination port (list or ranges).

   The b type SHALL be used with the following restrictions:

   o  Only the Action "permit" SHALL be used.

   o  No "options" SHALL be used.

   o  The invert modifier "!" for addresses SHALL not be used.

   o  The keyword "assigned" SHALL not be used.

   The Flow-Description AVP SHALL be used to describe a single IP flow.
   The direction "in" refers to uplink IP flows, and the direction "out"
   refers to downlink IP flows.

4.4.9.  PCN-Sent-Info AVP

   The PCN-Sent-Info AVP (AVP code <AVP7>) is of type Grouped.  It
   provides the rate of flow of PCN-marked traffic in octets per second
   that the ingress node derived for the identified ingress-egress

   aggregate for the measurement period ending at the time given by the
   Event-Timestamp AVP (if present).

   The PCN-Sent-Info AVP has the following format:

     PCN-Sent-Info ::= < AVP Header: AVP7 >
                       { I-E-Aggregate-Id }
                       { I-E-Aggregate-Sent-Rate }
                     * [ AVP ]

4.4.10.  I-E-Aggregate-Sent-Rate AVP

   The I-E-Aggregate-Sent-Rate AVP (AVP code <AVP8>) is of type
   Unsigned32.  It gives the rate of flow of PCN-marked traffic in
   octets per second that the ingress node forwarded to the identified
   ingress-egress aggregate, calculated for the measurement period
   ending at the time given by the Event-Timestamp AVP (if present).

4.5.  Procedures

   The following subsections discuss the processing requirements placed
   upon the various participating Diameter nodes by the PCN Data
   Collection application.

4.5.1.  Overall Procedures

   The egress node measures the traffic from a particular ingress node,
   and calculates the congestion level estimate(CLE) at the ingress-
   egress aggregate level.  The egress node may compare the CLE
   calculated at the current interval with the CLE calculated at the
   last interval, if the difference of the two CLEs exceeds a preset
   range, the egress node sends the feedback information, including at
   least the current CLE, to the PDP.  After receiving the feedback
   information, the PDP saves the it for admission control and flow
   termination.  After receiving a service flow request, the PDP can
   determine whether to admit the request or not based on the feedback
   information.  Besides, the PDP also decides whether some of the
   admitted flows need to be terminated.  The PDP needs to signal to the
   ingress node the decision about admission or termination.

4.5.2.  Egress Node behavior

   For each ingress-egress aggregate flow it serves, the egress node
   meters received traffic for PCN markings, recomputes its smoothed
   congestion level estimate, and determines whether there is excess
   flow in successive measurement periods in accordance with the PCN
   edge behavior specification deployed in the domain.  When a change in
   the smoothed congestion level estimate causes it to cross a reporting

   threshold, either upward or downward, the egress node MUST send a
   Congestion-Report-Request message to the PDP.  Similarly, the egress
   node MUST send a Congestion-Report-Request message to the PDP when
   excess flow is detected for an ingress-egress aggregate served by
   that node.

   The Event-Timestamp AVP SHOULD be present, and SHOULD provide the
   ending time of the measurement period from which the data triggering
   the generation of the message were derived.  At least one instance
   either of the PCN-Congestion-Info or the PCN-Excess-Flow-Info AVP
   MUST be present.  Both AVPs MAY be present for the same ingress-
   egress aggregate, if both apply according to the edge behavior
   specification.  Multiple instances of either AVP MAY be present, but
   each instance MUST report on a different ingress-egress aggregate.

4.5.3.  PDP behavior

   If the PDP receives an Congestion-Report-Request (CRR) identified as
   belonging to the PCN Data Collection application, it MUST acknowledge
   the message with an Congestion-Report-Answer (CRA).  The PDP usage of
   the information provided by PCN-Congestion-Info and PCN-Excess-Flow-
   Info AVPs is described in the applicable edge behavior specification.

   When the PDP receives an CRR containing an PCN-Excess-Flow-Info AVP,
   it MAY send a Measurement-Poll-Request (MPR) to the ingress node for
   the aggregate concerned.  The I-E-Aggregate-Id MUST identify the
   ingress-egress aggregate flow for which information is being
   requested.  The Event-Timestamp MUST be present if it was present in
   the CRR that contained the PCN-Excess-Flow-Info AVP, and MUST have
   the same value.

   If the PDP receives a successful Measurement-Poll-Answer message, it
   uses the information contained in the PCN-Sent-Info AVP as described
   in the applicable edge behavior specification.

4.5.4.  Ingress Node behavior

   When an ingress node receives an MPR, it MUST generate a Measurement-
   Poll-Answer message containing an instance of the PCN-Sent-Info AVP.
   The I-E-Aggregate-Id within the PCN-Sent-Info AVP MUST be the same as
   received in the MPR, and the I-E-Aggregate-Sent-Rate MUST be a rate
   measured for that aggregate.  If Event-Timestamp is present in the
   MPR, the measurement upon which I-E-Aggregate-Sent-Rate is based
   SHOULD be that for the latest measurement period ending before or at
   the time given by Event-Timestamp, if available.  In any case, Event-
   Timestamp SHOULD be present in the MPA, and if it is, MUST give the
   end-time of the measurement period upon which I-E-Aggregate-Sent-Rate
   is based.

6.  Security Considerations

   The following sections discuss the security threats against the
   Diameter PCN Data Collection application and describe some
   countermeasures.

6.1.  Traffic Security

   Application traffic MUST be secured as specified in RFC 3588 (i.e.,,
   through the use of (preferably) TLS or IPsec).  In the absence of
   appropriate protection, all manner (including man-in-the-middle) of
   attacks are possible, potentially resulting in the inappropriate
   termination and non-admittance of flows.

6.2.  Device Security

   Compromise of an ingress node by an attacker could result in the
   inappropriate refusal of admittance to valid flows, while the
   compromise of an egress node could allow the termination of valid
   flows.

   Compromise of the PDP could result in both denial of admission to new
   flows and termination of existing flows, enabling an attacker to
   essentially control PCN traffic on the affected network.
