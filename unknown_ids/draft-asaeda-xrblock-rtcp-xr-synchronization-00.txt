Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks                   May 2011


1.  Introduction

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   This new block type supports reporting of initial synchronization
   delay.  Information is recorded about the difference between the
   start of RTP sessions and the time the RTP receiver acquires all
   components of RTP sessions [RFC6051].  It also supports reporting of
   the general Synchronization offset status of an arbitrary number of
   streams, with the same RTCP CNAME.  Information is recorded about the
   synchronization offset time of each RTP stream relative to the
   reference RTP stream with the same CNAME and General Synchronization
   Offset of zero.

   The metrics belong to the class of transport level metrics defined in
   [MONARCH] (work in progress).


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability

   The report blocks defined in this document could be used by dedicated
   network monitoring applications.

   When joining a layered video session in such an application, a
   receiver may not synchronize playout across the multimedia session
   until RTCP SR packets have been received on all of the component RTP
   sessions.  For unicast session, the delay due to negotiation of NAT
   pinholes, firewall holes, quality-of-service, and media security keys
   is contributed to such initial synchronization playout.  For
   multicast session, such initial synchronization delay varies with the
   session bandwidth and the number of members, the number of senders in
   the session.  The synchronization delay and offset block can be used
   to report the initial synchronization delay of these RTP streams
   beyond the information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.
   In the absence of packet loss, the initial synchronization delay
   equals to the average time taken to receive the first RTCP packet in
   the RTP session with the longest RTCP reporting interval.  In the
   presence of packet loss, the media synchronization needs to wait

   until the reporting interval has passed, and the next RTCP SR packet
   is sent.

   In an RTP multimedia session, there can be an arbitrary number of
   streams, with the same RTCP CNAME.  This block can be used to report
   the general Synchronization offset status of these RTP streams beyond
   the information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  For
   layered session or multimedia session, the first RTP packet can be
   chosen as the basic packet of reference RTP stream.


4.  Synchronization Delay and Offset Metric Block

   Metrics in this block report on synchronization delay and offset in
   the stream arriving at the RTP system.


4.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The Synchronization Delay and Offset Metric Block has the following
   format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     BT=TBD    |I| tag |sdotype|          Block length         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |              Synchronization delay and offset                 |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.2.  Definition of Fields in Synchronization Delay and Offset Metrics
      Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The Layered Stream Statistics Metrics block is identified by the
      constant <LSSM>.

   Interval metric flag (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Basic Loss/Discard
      metrics are Interval or Cumulative metrics, that is, whether the
      reported values applies to the most recent measurement interval
      duration between successive metrics reports (I=1) (the Interval
      Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=0) (the Cumulative Duration).

Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks                   May 2011


   Measurement Identifier association (tag): 3 bits

      This field is used to identify the Measurement Identifier block
      [MEASIDENT] which describes this measurement.

   Synchronization Delay and Offset Metric Type (sdotype): 4 bits

      This field is used to identify the Synchronization Delay and
      Offset Metric Type used in this report block, according to the
      following code:
      *  0: Initial synchronization delay [RFC6051]
      *  1: General synchronization offset [RFC6051]

   Block length: 16 bits

      The constant 3, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   Synchronization delay and offset: 32 bits

      For Initial synchronization delay, the average delay, expressed in
      units of 1/65536 seconds, between the RTCP packets received on all
      of the components RTP sessions and the beginning of session
      [RFC6051].  The value is calculated as follows:

         The average time, expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds, taken
         to receive the first RTCP packet in the RTP session with the
         longest RTCP reporting interval [RFC6051].

      For General synchronization offset, This field represents the
      synchronization offset time of one RTP stream in milliseconds
      relative to the reference RTP stream with the same CNAME and
      General Synchronization Offset of zero [RFC6051].  This value is
      calculated based on the interarrival time between arbitrary RTP
      packet and the reference RTP packet with the same CNAME, and
      timestamps of this arbitrary RTP packet and the reference RTP
      packet with the same CNAME.


5.  SDP Signaling

   One new parameter is defined for the six report blocks defined in
   this document to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566] using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].
   They have the following syntax within the "rtcp-xr" attribute
   [RFC3611]:

     rtcp-xr-attrib =  "a=rtcp-xr:"
                       [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF
           xr-format = syn-delay-offset
              syn-delay-offset = " syn-delay-offset "
                              ["=" max-size]
                 max-size = 1*DIGIT ; maximum block size in octets

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.


6.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of [RFC3611].

   This document assigns one new block type value in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry:

      Name:       SDOM
      Long Name:  Synchronization Delay and Offset Metric
      Value       <SDOM>
      Reference:  Section 4

   This document also registers one new SDP [RFC4566] parameter for the
   "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry:

      *  "syn-delay-offset"

   The contact information for the registrations is:

   The new RTCP XR report blocks proposed in this document introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
