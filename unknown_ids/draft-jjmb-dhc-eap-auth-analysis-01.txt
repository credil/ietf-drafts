Internet-Draft        DHCP Authentication Analysis         November 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document provides an independent analysis of the proposal to
   support end-user authentication using extension to DHCP.  While the
   current proposal largley focuses on Broadband Digital Subscriber Line
   scenarions the adhoc team that has been assembled will evaulate the
   proposal generally from a DHCP point of view.  This analysis will
   also cite architectural and best practice considerations for the
   authors to consider as part of this work.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   The following terms and acronyms are used in this document:

   o  DHCPv4 - "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol" [RFC2131]

   o  DHCPv6 - "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6" [RFC3315]

   o  DHCP - DHCPv4 and/or DHCPv6


3.  Message and Option Definition

   In this section considerations pertaining to how the DHCPEAP messages
   have been defined in [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] are discussed.
   Recommendations as to how messages may be defined are also documented
   in this section.

3.1.  Message Type Overloading

   [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] defines a DHCP single EAP message to
   support end-user DHCP-based authentication.  However, the DHC working
   group has found that using the same DHCP message type for more than
   one leg of a packet exchange creates confusion, and we recommend
   instead that a different message type be used for each leg of the
   transaction.  In this case a four message model may better satisfy
   the requirements, similar, for example, to the DISCOVER/OFFER/
   REQUEST/ACK cycle in the standard DHCPv4 bootstrapping exchange.

Internet-Draft        DHCP Authentication Analysis         November 2009


3.2.  Differences in Message and Option Names

   [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] mingles DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 message types.
   This is not valid.  DHCPv4 messages and options must be clearly
   defined and referenced to for IPv4.  DHCPv6 messages and options must
   be defined and referenced for IPv6.

3.3.  Message and Option Sizing

   [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] introduces a DHCP Capability Vendor-
   specific Suboption for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 which is specified to carry
   authentication information.  This information is required to support
   the desired protocol behavior.  However, including this data in a
   DHCP greatly increases the size of the DHCP option payload.  While
   [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] specifies how large options are to be
   handled, this large option payload still has the potential to create
   problems; there is the potential for this option to squeeze out other
   DHCP options required for correct DHCP configuration

   Additionally, the authors of [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] should mention
   that in practice the Maximum Message Size option is rarely used by
   DHCP clients and as such we have no real operational experience that
   tells us what percentage of relay agents will fail in the face of
   DHCP packets larger than 576 bytes.

3.4.  RADIUS Message Requirements

   Section 5.1 and 5.2 of [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] mention RADIUS
   attributes required to support this behavior.  These are not included
   as part of [RFC4014].  These messages still need to be specified.


4.  Protocol behavior

   [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] requires that end-user DHCP-based
   authentication must be handled independently in the case where both
   IPv4 and IPv6 service are present.  [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] is not
   clear as to how clients and servers handle conflicts where both IPv4
   and IPv6 are used simultaneously and further how conflicts are
   resolved when such scenarios arise.  See the beginning of section 5
   of [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl].

4.1.  DHCP Clients

4.1.1.  Packet Size

   Packet size for DHCP clients that support end-user DHCP-based
   authentication remains a concern.  DHCP clients MUST advertise their



Brzozowski, et al.        Expires May 23, 2010                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        DHCP Authentication Analysis         November 2009


   ability to support larger packet sizes, however, this alone will not
   ensure that intermediate elements like DHCP relay agents will support
   the same or adversely impact exchanges between DHCP clients and
   servers.  DHCP clients in this case include but are not limited to
   those include with operating systems and home networking equipment.

4.1.2.  Standalone Client Behavior

   The behavior for home gateway (HG) as defined in
   [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] has been specified, however, specification
   of standalone client behavior remains absent.  In order for this
   proposal to be complete it must be specified how standalone client
   are to behave to support end-user authentication using DHCP.

4.1.3.  Handling of non-EAP responses

   Section 5 of [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] also indicates that a client
   may receive one or more DHCP OFFER/ADVERTISE messages some of which
   may or may not support DHCP EAP authentication.  It is unclear and
   unspecified how or if the client is to wait for DHCPEAP messages if
   it has already received a DHCPOFFER or DHCP Advertise message.  An
   EAP-capable client could accept a DHCPOFFER or DHCP Advertise message
   and consequently miss a subsequent DHCPEAP message, which would
   prevent it from authenticating.

   This is further complicated in the case where the DHCP client is not
   a home gateway, and may in fact be a portable device such as a laptop
   computer.  When the DHCP/EAP capable client is connected to a
   provider network supporting DHCP/EAP, the client may wait for a
   DHCPEAP message from the server.  When the client is connected to
   some other network, where DHCP/EAP is not supported, it may still
   wait for such a message.  This would create a delay in the
   availability of the network for the end user when not connecting to
   the provider network.

4.1.4.  Protocol State Machine is Only in Client

   [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] proposes that if the relay agent or server
   decides to do DHCP/EAP, the original DHCPDISCOVER message from the
   DHCP client will be cached.  Once the EAP authentication has
   succeeded, the DHCPDISCOVER will be forwarded to the server or, in
   the case where the server does the EAP authentication, the server
   will take the cached DHCPDISCOVER and send a DHCPOFFER in response to
   it.

   However, this proposal ignores the fact that the DHCP client, not the
   DHCP server, drives the DHCP protocol.  The DHCP client determines
   when to send the DHCPDISCOVER, and the DHCP server responds.  The



Brzozowski, et al.        Expires May 23, 2010                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        DHCP Authentication Analysis         November 2009


   DHCP client determines when to send the DHCPREQUEST, and the DHCP
   server responds.  The DHCP client determines when to renew, and so
   on.

   Hence, we strongly recommend that the proposed protocol be changed so
   that, after a successful DHCP/EAP exchange, the DHCP client restarts
   its state machine at the INIT state and sends a new DHCPDISCOVER,
   with a new transaction ID.  This eliminates three problems:

      - the need for the DHCP server or relay to cache the DHCPDISCOVER

      - the problem of how to retransmit if the DHCP server doesn't send
      a response to the DHCPDISCOVER cached and eventually forwarded by
      the relay agent

      - the problem that the DHCP client state machine would have to
      remember the xid in the original DHCPDISCOVER packet, even though
      it's gone through several state transitions since the DHCPDISCOVER
      was sent.

   Needless to say, the same suggestion applies for the DHCPv6 protocol,
   although the names of the packets are different and DHCPv6 doesn't
   name the client's states.

4.1.5.  Transaction IDs

   The proposed protocol extension does not document the handling of the
   DHCP client's transaction IDs during the processing of EAP-specific
   messages.  We recommend that each EAP message sourced by the client
   have a new transaction ID, which should then be returned in the
   response from the server.

4.1.6.  EAP Protocol Direction

   The proposed protocol extension attempts to replace PPPoE/EAP with a
   new protocol based on DHCP.  However, the DHCP protocol is client-
   initiated, whereas EAP is server-initiated.  For example, consider
   PPP Extensible Authentication Protocol [RFC2284].  In this document,
   the authenticator initiates the packet exchange after the layer two
   (PPPoE) connection is established.

   The proposal does not explain how this incompatibility is resolved.
   Either the proposal needs to turn the DHCP client state machine on
   its head, or it needs to turn the EAP state machine on its head.  The
   document proposes neither solution, so we can't evaluate the impact
   the solution to this problem would have on the DHCP protocol.

Internet-Draft        DHCP Authentication Analysis         November 2009


4.1.7.  Reliable Delivery of EAP messages

   The proposal doesn't talk about retransmission for DHCPEAP messages.
   This is a particularly important omission because of the reversal of
   roles implicit in doing DHCP over EAP, as discussed in the previous
   section, "EAP Protocol Direction."  Since DHCP is a UDP-based
   protocol with no guaranteed delivery, retransmission is not optional,
   and the way in which the DHCP client or EAP authenticator does
   retransmission must be specified explicitly, or this proposal does
   not in any way guarantee interoperability.

4.1.8.  Re-Authentication

   The proposal doesn't cover re-authentication.  Although section 2,
   "Problem Statement," mentions user authentication and connection
   liveness probing, the actual protocol document never proposes a
   method whereby this requirement is satisfied.

   We theorize that it might be possible to somehow accomplish this
   using DHCPFORCERENEW in DHCPv4 and DHCP Reconfigure in DHCPv6, but
   nowhere in the document is this solution discussed.  So again, there
   is no way to evaluate how the solution to this problem would interact
   with DHCP.

4.2.  DHCP Servers

   In the DHCP protocol, the state machine is in the client, not the
   server.  The server retains information about the client's IP address
   allocation, but from the perspective of the protocol, the DHCP server
   only sends messages in response to messages sent by the DHCP client.
   So [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] places a new requirement on DHCP servers
   that they retain DHCPDISCOVER messages sent by clients during the EAP
   authentication process.  This problem would be solved by following
   the related recommendations in the earlier section on DHCP clients.

4.3.  DHCP Relay Agents

   [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] does not say whether or not the relay agent
   should append a relay agent information option to EAP-specific
   messages.  We think that a non-EAP-aware relay agent would have to do
   so, but the draft should talk about this issue.

   [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] proposes a mode in which the DHCP relay
   agent implements the EAP protocol itself, rather than relying on the
   DHCP server to do so.  In order to do this, the relay agent, which in
   the normal DHCP protocol is completely stateless, must now retain
   state regarding the progress of the DHCP protocol.  There are two
   different ways in which this protocol extension adds state to the



Brzozowski, et al.        Expires May 23, 2010                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        DHCP Authentication Analysis         November 2009


   relay agent:

      - The relay agent must retain the initial DHCPDISCOVER packet sent
      by the client.

      - Once the EAP authentication has succeeded, the relay agent must
      remember that the authentication has succeeded, so that if the
      DHCP client must retransmit its DHCPDISCOVER, the relay agent does
      not attempt to redo the entire EAP authentication process.  This
      state must be retained for the entire duration of the DHCP
      protocol from that point on, so that the initial four-way
      handshake can complete, and so that any subsequent renewals,
      rebinds, and INIT-REBOOT renewals can complete.  In order to avoid
      caching this state forever, the relay agent would have to retain
      lease timing information so that it could time out cached
      information as the leases associated with that information expire.

   For this reason, we strongly recommend that the authors abandon the
   idea of implementing this protocol extension in the relay agent.
   Also, please note that this is true for the DHCPv6 exchange as well
   as the DHCPv4 exchange; we only document the DHCPv4 exchange for
   brevity.


5.  Compatibility

   The compatibility of clients, servers, and relay agents that
   implement this behavior with legacy clients, servers, and relay
   agents MUST be explicitly documented.  The behavior of the remaining
   elements that do not support this behavior while others do MUST be
   considered, specifically, how will legacy element handle the presence
   of the corresponding DHCP options when present.  Consider the
   following scenarios for example:

   1.  DHCP client support for authentication

   2.  DHCP relay agent support for authentication

   3.  DHCP server support for authentication

   4.  DHCP client, server, and relay agent support for authentication

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


8.  Security Considerations

   The current version of [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] indicates that
   [RFC3118] likely cannot be seamlessly integrated with existing
   RADIUS-based AAA infrastructure used in Broadband DSL environments.
   [I-D.pruss-dhcp-auth-dsl] must elaborate on how DHCP EAP can be
   secured if not by leveraging [RFC3118].  While the use cases for that
   extension are hard to evaluate, so it seems that this draft is
   neutral toward other DHCP security mechanisms, with one small caveat:
   since it increases the DHCP message size, it is competing for space
   in the DHCP packet with other authentication options.  However,
   existing [RFC3118] authentication schemes use relatively short
   signatures and keys, so in practice this is probably not a serious
   concern.
