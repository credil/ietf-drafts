Abstract

   For stateless IPv4/IPv6 translator, it may receive ICMPv6 packets
   containing non IPv4-translatable addresses as the source.  This
   document defines a stateless address mapping mechanism for source
   address translation in ICMPv6 headers for such cases.

Internet-Draft      Source Address Mapping for ICMPv6        August 2010


1.  Introduction

   The IP/ICMP translation document of IPv4/IPv6 translation
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] states that "the IPv6 addresses in the
   ICMPv6 header may not be IPv4-translatable addresses and there will
   be no corresponding IPv4 addresses represented of this IPv6 address.
   In this case, the translator can do stateful translation.  A
   mechanism by which the translator can instead do stateless
   translation is left for future work. " This document defines such a
   mechanism.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Problem Statement

   As shown in the following figure, IPv6 host (H6) and IPv4 host (H4)
   can communicate via a stateless translator (XLATE).  H6 is configured
   with an IPv4-translatable IPv6 address while IPv6 routers (R2, R3 and
   R4) are configured with non IPv4-translatable addresses.


           ------                                         ------
          | IPv4 |   --      -----      --    --    --   | IPv6 |
          | host |--|R1|----|XLATE|----|R2|--|R3|--|R4|--| host |
          |  H4  |   --      -----      --    --    --   |  H6  |
           ------              |                          ------
                               |
                      IPv4 --->|<---IPv6

            Figure 1: Example topology of stateless translation

   If a packet sent by H4 exceeds the link MTU between R3 and R4, then
   R3 will generate a "Packet Too Big" ICMPv6 error message.  In this
   case, the destination address is IPv4-converted address of H4 and the
   source address is non IPv4-translatable address of R3.  Due to path
   MTU discovery requirement, the ICMPv6 MUST be translated to ICMP by
   XLATE.  It is clear that the IPv4 source addresses of the ICMP
   packets translated by the translator SHOULD be valid IPv4 addresses
   in order not to be dropped alone the path, but who sends the ICMP
   error message is not as important as the content itself.

Internet-Draft      Source Address Mapping for ICMPv6        August 2010


4.  Analysis of the Possible Approaches

4.1.  Configure IPv6 Routers Using IPv4-translatable Addresses

   Stateless translation can be used for scenarios 1, 2, 5 and 6
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework] and all of these scenarios are
   concerning "an IPv6 network".  Except for the case when "an IPv6
   network" has multiple translators using different IPv6 prefixes, the
   network administrator can configure IPv6 routers using IPv4-
   translatable addresses and therefore the translator can translate the
   source addresses of ICMPv6 packets generated by IPv6 routers to valid
   IPv4 addresses.  There are two variations of this method to form
   IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses based on the algorithm defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].

4.1.1.  Use Public IPv4 Addresses

   The IPv6 routers in "an IPv6 network" can be configured using IPv4-
   translatable addresses, which are based on public IPv4 addresses.  In
   this case, public IPv4 addresses will be wasted, since all interfaces
   of all IPv6 routers require IPv4-translatable addresses.

4.1.2.  Use RFC1918 Addresses

   The IPv6 routers in "an IPv6 network" can be configured using IPv4-
   translatable addresses, which are based on [RFC1918] addresses.  In
   this case, there is no waste of public IPv4 addresses.

   This method is similar to an IPv4 network when the infrastructure is
   using [RFC1918] addresses.

4.2.  Perform Stateful Source Address Mapping for ICMPv6 Packets

   When translator receives ICMPv6 containing non IPv4-translatable
   address as the source, the translator can do stateful translation.
   There are two variations of the stateful translation.

4.2.1.  Use Public IPv4 Addresses

   The translator can treat ICMPv6 packets the same as the ordinary IPv6
   packets and performs stateful translation.  However, this will
   consume public IPv4 addresses in the address pool if a lot of ICMPv6
   packets are received.

4.2.2.  Use RFC1918 Addresses

   The translator can do stateful translation, but map the source
   addresses of the ICMPv6 packets to [RFC1918] addresses.  This method



Li, et al.              Expires February 24, 2011               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      Source Address Mapping for ICMPv6        August 2010


   does not consume public IPv4 addresses for the ICMPv6.

4.3.  Use Translator's Interface Address to Represent Source Address for
      ICMPv6 Packets

   The translator can map non IPv4-translatable source addresses of the
   ICMPv6 packets to the interface address of the translator.  This
   method does not waste public IPv4 addresses and is used in
   [I-D.xli-behave-ivi].

4.4.  Comparisons

   The current approaches have their own drawbacks:

   1.  Configuring IPv6 routers using IPv4-translatable addresses may
       involve the renumbering of all the IPv6 interface addresses in
       all routers.  In addition, if public IPv4 addresses are used, it
       is a waste of the address resource.  The major problem is that if
       multiple translators with multiple prefixes are used, there is no
       way to do so, since IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses are prefix
       dependent.

   2.  Performing stateful source address mapping for ICMPv6 Packets can
       be used in an environment when the translator operates in
       combined stateless/stateful modes, or in stateful-only mode.
       However, for stateless-only translator, performing stateful
       source address mapping for ICMPv6 Packets is not worth the cost.

   3.  Using translator's interface address to represent source address
       for ICMPv6 Packets is the simplest method.  However, different
       non IPv4-translatable addresses will be mapped to same IPv4
       address.  In the case of traceroute, it may be confused as a
       routing loop.

   Therefore, it is desirable to define a new mapping mechanism.


5.  Stateless Source Address Mapping Algorithms for ICMPv6 Packets

   Based on above analysis, the requirements of stateless source address
   mapping for ICMPv6 Packets are:

   1.  The ICMP that is translated from ICMPv6 by translator SHOULD not
       be dropped by the IPv4 routers.  This implies the source address
       of the ICMP SHOULD use valid IPv4 address.  In addition, the
       source address SHOULD follow the uRPF policy if it is configured.

Internet-Draft      Source Address Mapping for ICMPv6        August 2010


   2.  Since it is impossible to uniquely map arbitrary IPv6 addresses
       to different IPv4 addresses and content in the ICMP message is
       more important than who generating the content, a unique reverse
       mapping from these IPv4 addresses to the original IPv6 addresses
       is not critical.

   3.  Public IPv4 addresses SHOULD not be wasted.

   4.  If possible, the source address of the ICMP MAY indicate that it
       is translated from non IPv4-translatable IPv6 address by the
       translator.

   5.  If possible, different non IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses MAY
       have different IPv4 address representations for a specific
       application.

   Therefore, we can use a small IPv4 address block as a to represent a
   group of non IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.  The next question is
   how big of this small IPv4 address block.  Consider a traceroute
   application, in order to identify different routers alone a path an
   IPv4 /24 is a reasonable size, since the maximum value of hop count
   is 256 in IPv6.

5.1.  Choosing an IPv4 /24 Address Block

5.1.1.  Use Public IPv4 Addresses

   The network administrator can allocate a public IPv4 /24 for the
   source address mapping of ICMPv6 packets.  The advantage is that it
   is totally under network administrator's control.  However, it wastes
   public IPv4 addresses and except the network operator of this
   network, no body knows that they are the holder of non IPv4-
   translatable IPv6 addresses.

5.1.2.  Use RFC1918 Addresses

   An IPv4 /24 can be allocated from [RFC1918] address block.  There is
   no waste of public IPv4 addresses.  However, if the organization's
   network also uses RFC1918's block, it may cause confusion.  In
   addition, except the network operator of this network, no body knows
   that they are the holder of non IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.

5.1.3.  Ask IANA for allocating an IPv4 Well-Known Prefix

   Allocating an IPv4 /24 as Well-Known Prefix by IANA for mapping
   source address in ICMPv6 packet has several advantages.

   o  There is no waste of public IPv4 addresses, since same IPv4 /24
      can be used for different networks.

   o  The Well-Known Prefix can be used to identify the IPv4 addresses
      are actually mapped from non IPv4-translatable addresses via IPv4/
      IPv6 translator.

5.2.  Design an Algorithm to Generate the Last Octet of IPv4 /24

5.2.1.  Randomly Generate the Last Octet

   The translator can randomly generates the Last Octet of the /24
   prefix for different non IPv4-translatable addresses as shown in the
   following figure



                 0         8        16        24         32
                  ----------------------------+----------
                 | Prefix                     | Random   |
                  ----------------------------+----------


                  Figure 2: Randomly generated Last Octet

   However, in this case the translator may need to maintain some states
   to ensure same non IPv4-translatable IPv6 address maps to same IPv4
   address.

5.2.2.  Copy Hop Count into Last Octet

   Routers typically emit ICMPv6 packets with the same hop count.  Thus,
   as the ICMPv6 packet is routed through the network its hop count is
   decreased.  Hence, the translator can copy the "Hop Count" in the
   IPv6 header of the ICMPv6 to the Last Octet as shown in the following
   figure.



                 0         8        16        24         32
                  ----------------------------+----------
                 | Prefix                     |Hop Count |
                  ----------------------------+----------


                 Figure 3: Copy Hop Count into Last Octet

   If the routers emit ICMPv6 packets with different hop counts, it may

   give the appearance of a routing loop to tools such as traceroute.
   That minor side-effect in that particular case cannot be avoided
   while still being stateless.

5.2.3.  Hashing of the IPv6 address to generate Last Octet

   Hashing of the IPv6 address to generate a 8 bit value which will be
   used to generate the last octet.



                 0         8        16        24         32
                  ----------------------------+----------
                 | Prefix                     |Hashing   |
                  ----------------------------+----------


       Figure 4: Hashing of the IPv6 address to generate Last Octet

   The advantages of this approach are: No need to maintain expensive
   states, except hashing table which should be simple with minimal
   memory usage and consume minimal CPU cycles.  If the hashing function
   is good and there are limited number of IPv6 routers (< 256) on the
   IPv6 side of the network, we will get unique IPv4 addresses to map
   the addresses of the IPv6 routers with O(1) lookup.

5.3.  Recommendations

   According to above discussion, we suggest asking IANA for an IPv4 /24
   as a "Well-Known Prefix" and give the routing administrators option
   to configure one of the approaches:

   1.  Random Approach.

   2.  "Hop Count" approach.

   3.  Hashing approach.


6.  Security Considerations

   None.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo asks IANA for an IPv4 /24 as a "Well-Known Prefix".

   Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
   correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are
   required, or if those assignments or registries are created during
   the RFC publication process.  From the author's perspective, it may
   therefore be removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor's
   discretion.
