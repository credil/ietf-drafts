   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>
       Mobile IPv6 has relied on IPsec and IKE/v2 for securing the
       signaling and user traffic. A single security mechanism for
       Mobile IPv6 does not adequately address various deployment
       scenarios. The one-size-fits-all security approach is ill
       suited for Mobile IPv6. Multiple alternatives to securing
       signaling and user traffic have been proposed and are being
       considered for standardization. When multiple security
       protocols coexist for providing security for mobile IPv6 nodes,
       there is a need to negotiate the choice of protocol between a
       mobile node and home agent apriori. This document proposes a
       method for negotiation the security protocol to be used betewen
       mobile IPv6 nodes.
     </t>
     <t>
       Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC3775" /> security using IPsec and
       IKE is specified in <xref target="RFC3776" /> and
       <xref target="RFC4877"/>.
       A number of alternate security protocols for use by mobile IPv6
       nodes have been proposed. Authentication protocol for Mobile
       IPv6 <xref target="RFC4285" /> is an example of one such. The
       use of such a mechanism is however restricted to networks with
       certain characterstics that are documented in the RFC.
       </t>
     <t>
       More recently other security mechanisms for use in Mobile IPv6
       deployments have been proposed. Transport Layer Security-based
       Mobile IPv6 Security Framework for Mobile Node to Home Agent
       Communication
       <xref target="I-D.ietf-mext-mip6-tls" /> proposes a
       security solution that uses TLS between the mobile node (MN)
       and a home agent controller (HAC) to bootstrap the security
       protocol between the MN and home agent (HA). Authorizing Mobile
       IPv6 Binding Update with Cryptographically Generated Addresses
       <xref target="I-D.laganier-mext-cga"/> proposes the use of CGA
       for securing  the signaling between an MN and HA.

	      The home agent controller is a node responsible for bootstrapping
	      Mobile IPv6 security associations between a mobile node and one or
	      more home agents.  The home agent controller also provides key
	      distribution to both mobile nodes and home agents.  Optionally,
	      Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping can be done in addition to the security
	      association bootstrapping between the mobile node and home agent
	      controller.

<section title="Problem Statement">
  <t>
    Security for Mobile IPv6 signaling and user traffic can be
    achieved via the use of different mechanisms. At the present time
    the use of IPsec and IKEv2 is mandated and choice of any other
    security protocol does not exist. However the use of IPsec and IKE
    for providing security does not fit all deployments. Alternate
    security solutions have been proposed and could be used. The use
    of a security protocol by mobile IPv6 nodes should be driven by
    the needs and requirements of a specific deployment. An enterprise
    deployment of Mobile IPv6 will have a different set of security
    requirements as compared to a cellular operator offering mobile
    IPv6 service.
  </t>
  <t>
    When Mobile IPv6 hosts have the option of choosing from multiple
    security protocols, there is a need to negotiate the use of a
    specific protocol between a mobile node and home agent prior to
    operation. This problem is dealt with in the scope of this draft
    and solutions proposed.
  </t>

</section>

<section title="Using the Home agent controller">
  <t>
    The home agent controller (HAC) is an entity that is defined in
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-mext-mip6-tls"/>. The HAC provides the MN with
    bootstrapping information of Mobile IPv6 such as assigned HA address, Home Network
	Prefix and MN IPv6 and/or IPv4 HoA. In addition, it assigns security 
	parameters information to constitute the MN-HA security association.
	The security association information is distributed to the HA assigned 
	to be used by the MN.
	When negotiating the security protocol to be used by the MN, 
	the home agent controller plays the role of negotiating the 
	security protocol to be used between a mobile node and the home agent. 
	The HAC is aware of the capabilities and security protocols of various 
	home agents that it is associated with. An MN MUST contact the HAC to obtain
    the home agent and home address to use. The MN can also inform the
    HAC about the security protocols that it supports and can use for
    securing signaling and user traffic. The HAC will then assign the
    MN a valid home agent in addition to informing it of the security
    protocol to be used. Optionally the HAC may provide the MN and
    assigned HA the relevant security paremeters such as keys, SPI, ciphers
    etc. for securing the signaling and traffic. The MN may be
    configured with the address of HACs or alternatively it may
    discover a HAC via DNS. This is dealt with in the
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-mext-mip6-tls"/> document.
  </t>
</section>


<section title="Negotiation of security protocol">

  <t>
    The mobile node establishes a TLS connection with the home agent
    controller (HAC) and exchanges a set of messages via this secure TLS
    tunnel to bootstrap mobile IPv6 as well as negotiate the choice of
    security protocol. The security protocol information is exchanged using
	the Request-Response messaging within the TLS secure tunnel.
	The signaling flow diagram below illustrates this negotiation mechanism:

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
  <t>
    The signaling between the mobile node and home agent controller is
    secured by TLS. All the messages between the MN and HAC are
    tunnelled within the TLS connection and hence secured. The MN and
    Home agent (HA) are either colocated or have a secure messaging
    interface between them.
    There exists the potential to downgrade the choice of the security
    protocol between an MN and HA. However the HAC chooses the
    security protocol to be used based on the capabilities of the MN
    as well as policy information from an entity such as AAA. In case
    the MN is incapable of more robust secure mechanisms, the HAC may
    assign such a home agent with limited capabilities and
    connectivity.
  </t>

<section anchor="Summary" title="Summary and Conclusion">
    <t>
      The choice of security protocols to be used in mobile IPv6
      deployments increases the flexibility of the protocol and makes
      it viable for use in different deployment scenarios. This
      however does result in the need for negotiation of a security
      protocol to be used between the MN and HA. The capabilities of
      the MN and home agents available for use to an MN determine the
      security protocol that can be used. Use of a home agent
      controller provides Mobile IPv6 with a robust mechanism for
      bootstrapping as well negotiation the security protocol.
