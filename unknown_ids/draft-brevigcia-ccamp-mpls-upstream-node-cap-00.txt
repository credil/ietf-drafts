Abstract

   This document proposes to extend [TE-NODE-CAP] in order to support
   additional TE node capabilities in the context of Point-to-MultiPoint
   (P2MP) LSP routing and fast reroute protection.  As for point-to-
   point LSP, nesting P2MP LSPs into P2MP Tunnels is a desirable
   traffic-engineering feature.  However, nesting P2MP LSPs requires a
   mechanism to coordinate the label allocation of the inner P2MP LSP
   between the egress nodes of the P2MP Tunnel as described in [MPLS-
   UPSTREAM].  To solve this issue, a new label allocation scheme called
   Upstream Label Assignment (ULA) is defined.  Network elements
   responsible for the route computation of P2MP LSP should be aware of
   the nodes that support this functionality.  For that purpose, we
   define a new bit flag to the TE Node Capability Descriptor as defined
   in [TE-NODE-CAP].  The bit flag (U) enables a node to advertise its
   capability to accept Upstream Label Assignment.

2.  Introduction

   This document proposes to extend [TE-NODE-CAP] in order to support
   additional TE node capabilities in the context of Point-to-MultiPoint
   (P2MP) LSP routing and Fast ReRoute protection.  As for point-to-
   point LSP, nesting P2MP LSPs into P2MP Tunnels is a desirable
   traffic-engineering feature.  P2MP Fast ReRoute (FRR) [P2MP-FRR] is
   typical application of P2MP LSPs nesting that is likely to be
   deployed in MPLS-TE networks transporting multicast traffic.

   However, nesting P2MP LSPs requires a mechanism to coordinate the
   label allocation of the inner P2MP LSP between the egress nodes of
   the P2MP Tunnel as described in [MPLS-UPSTREAM].  To solve this
   issue, a new label allocation scheme called Upstream Label Assignment
   (ULA) is defined where the ingress node of the P2MP Tunnel allocates
   a single label to the egress nodes of the P2MP Tunnel for the nested
   P2MP LSP.  Using this technique raises an additional issue: as the
   upstream neighbor now assigns the label, two different upstream nodes
   may allocate the same label value to the same receiver(s) for two
   different P2MP LSPs nested in different P2MP Tunnels.  The egress
   nodes cannot anymore distinguish the LSPs based on the incoming label
   value.  To overcome this issue, [MPLS-UPSTREAM] defines a Context-
   specific Label Space (CLS).  The egress node must now disambiguate
   the label it receives based on the value of this label and according
   to the emitting node (i.e., defining a per-upstream-neighbor label
   space) or according to the value of the P2MP Tunnel label (i.e.,
   defining a per-tunnel label space).

   [RSVP-UPSTREAM] and [LDP-UPSTREAM] define extensions to [RFC4875] and
   [MLDP] to support the advertisement of the ULA capability between
   adjacent nodes - i.e., between nodes which have a signaling
   adjacency.  Unfortunately, when nesting P2MP LSPs in P2MP Tunnels,
   the ingress nodes and the egress nodes usually do not have such a
   signaling adjacency.  Nevertheless, the knowledge of this capability
   is crucial when calculating the routes of nested P2MP LSPs over P2MP
   tunnels (either by the ingress node or by a Path Computation Element,
   PCE).  If the ingress of the (nested) P2MP LSP or the PCE does not
   have a control adjacency with the egress nodes of the P2MP Tunnel,
   LSP setup will be tried and will fail in case all the egress nodes do
   not support the ULA capability.  This is a trial-and-error approach,
   which can reveal inefficient and time and resource consuming.

   The idea is thus to extend the MPLS/GMPLS routing protocols (OSPF-TE
   and IS-IS-TE) to allow LSRs to inform all nodes within a network
   domain of a node's capability to receive upstream-assigned labels and
   process them accordingly.  Using the routing protocol guarantees this
   information will be distributed to all nodes, which should perform
   route calculations, independently of the signaling protocols used for

   establishing the LSPs (LDP and/or RSVP-TE).

   For that purpose, this document defines a new bit flag to the TE Node
   Capability Descriptor as defined in [TE-NODE-CAP].  The bit flag (U)
   enables a node to advertise its capability to accept Upstream Label
   Assignment.

   *** Open for discussion ***

   Two additional bit flags can be defined to indicate the type of
   context label space the egress node accepts.

   The bit flag (N) enables a node to advertise its capability to
   maintain and process per-upstream-neighbor context-specific labels.

   The bit flag (T) enables a node to advertise its capability to
   maintain and process per-tunnel-neighbor context-specific labels.

3.  Advantages of the solution

   The advertisement of the ULA capability across the network brings
   additional Traffic Engineering possibilities to better manage P2MP TE
   LSPs.

   A first advantage of the proposed solution concerns P2MP TE path
   computation.  When transporting multicast traffic over their MPLS
   networks, service providers and operators will often establish P2MP
   TE Tunnels and nest the client P2MP LSPs into them in order to keep
   control of the planning and resource allocation in their networks.

   As described briefly above, remote nodes at the endpoints of tunnels
   do not usually establish signaling adjacency because this would
   result in a fully connected graph where each node would have a
   control adjacency with all other nodes in the network.  Similarly, if
   the network operator uses a PCE to calculate P2MP TE paths, the
   knowledge of the ULA capability cannot be advertised by the signaling
   protocols.  Therefore, in order to avoid these blocking situations
   and to allow remote nodes to efficiently calculate TE P2MP paths with
   all the relevant information, disseminating the node capability to
   accept upstream-assigned labels through IGP routing protocols appears
   as a desirable feature and seems a scalable and efficient approach.

   Moreover, if an operator wishes to setup P2MP tunnels to transport
   P2MP LSPs, the egress nodes of the P2MP tunnel will have to support
   ULA.  Therefore, it is pointless to setup a P2MP tunnel to only
   afterwards fail in all nested P2MP LSP establishments; it is much
   more efficient to have the relevant information for the P2MP tunnel
   setup right from the start.

   A second advantage of the proposed solution concerns P2MP fast
   reroute protection.  As described in [P2MP-FRR], in the P2MP Facility
   Backup method, a P2MP Bypass Tunnel can be used to protect a set of
   P2MP TE LSPs.  During failure, the same backup label MUST be used for
   all S2L sub-LSPs of a given backup P2MP LSP, tunneled within the same
   P2MP Bypass Tunnel to avoid data replication and traffic mis-routing
   in the Merge Points (MP).  The Point of Local Repair (PLR) assigns
   the same label to all the Merge Points (MP) using the Upstream Label
   Assignment procedure.

   The backup P2MP LSPs and the P2MP Bypass tunnel have to be
   established prior to the failure and to work properly, the mechanism
   needs to know the capability of the remote nodes to accept upstream-
   assigned labels.  If some egress nodes do not support ULA, then the
   PLR will establish dedicated P2P Tunnels towards them.

   In P2MP FRR protection, the knowledge of the ULA capability is

   crucial and particularly important in order to limit the number of
   trials before the appropriate backup LSP(s) are found and
   established.

   Globally, the proposed solution to transport the ULA capability bit
   in IGP routing protocols enables a scalable deployment of the P2MP
   mechanisms, protection mechanisms to work properly, and provides for
   less failure during the signaling phase.

4.  New value to the TE Node Capability Descriptor

   The TE Node Capability Descriptor contains a variable length set of
   bit flags, where each bit corresponds to a given TE node capability.

   Currently, five TE Node Capabilities are defined in [TE-NODE-CAP].
   This document defines a new TE Node Capability:

   - U bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR accepts Upstream
   Label Assignment ([RSVP-UPSTREAM], [LDP-UPSTREAM]);

   *** Open for discussion ***

   - N bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR accepts per-
   upstream-neighbor label space.

   - T bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR accepts per-
   tunnel label space.

5.  TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV formats

5.1.  OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV format

   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is a variable length TLV
   that contains a series of bit flags, where each bit correspond to a
   TE node capability.

   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is carried within an OSPF
   Router Information LSA which is defined in [OSPF-CAP].

   The format of the OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is the same
   as the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF
   [RFC3630].  That is, the TLV is composed of 2 octets for the type, 2
   octets specifying the length of the value field and a value field.

   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV has the following format:

   TYPE: Assigned by IANA - see Section 8.1.

   LENGTH: Variable (multiple of 4).

   VALUE: Array of units of 32 flags numbered from the most significant
   bit as bit zero, where each bit represents a TE node capability.

   The following bits are added:

   Bit Capabilities

   5 U bit: If set this indicates that the LSR accepts Upstream Label
   Assignment ([RSVP-UPSTREAM], [LDP-UPSTREAM]).

   *** Open for discussion ***

   6 N bit: If set, this indicates that the LSR accepts per-upstream-
   neighbor label space.

   7 T bit: If set, this indicates that the LSR accepts per-tunnel label
   space.

5.2.  IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV format

   The IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV is a variable length
   sub-TLV that contains a series of bit flags, where each bit

   correspond to a TE node capability.

   The IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV is carried within an
   IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV which is defined in [IS-IS-CAP].

   The format of the IS-IS TE Node Capability sub-TLV is the same as the
   TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to IS-IS
   [RFC3784].  That is, the TLV is composed of 1 octet for the type, 1
   octet specifying the TLV length and a value field.

   The IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV has the following
   format:

   TYPE: Assigned by IANA - see Section 8.1.

   LENGTH: Variable (multiple of 4).

   VALUE: Array of units of 32 flags numbered from the most significant
   bit as bit zero, where each bit represents a TE node capability.

   The following bits are added:

   Bit Capabilities

   5 U bit: If set this indicates that the LSR accepts Upstream Label
   Assignment ([RSVP-UPSTREAM], [LDP-UPSTREAM]).

   6 N bit: If set, this indicates that the LSR accepts per-upstream-
   neighbor label space.

   7 T bit: If set, this indicates that the LSR accepts per-tunnel label
   space.

9.  IANA considerations

9.1.  Capability Registry

   [OSPF-CAP] defines a new code point registry for TLVs carried in the
   Router Information LSA defined in [OSPF-CAP].

   IANA is requested to make a new codepoint assignment from that
   registry for the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV defined in this
   document and carried within the Router Information LSA.  The value 1
   is suggested.  See Section 4.1 of this document.

   IANA is requested to make assignments for the (three) TE node
   capability(ies) defined in this document (see Sections 4.1 and 4.2)
   using the following suggested values, in the Capability Registry for
   TE-node capabilities:
