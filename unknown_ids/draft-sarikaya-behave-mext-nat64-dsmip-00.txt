             draft-sarikaya-behave-mext-nat64-dsmip-00.txt

Abstract

   This memo specifies how IPv6 only mobile nodes (MN) receiving host-
   based mobility management using Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 (DSMIPv6) can
   communicate with IPv4 only servers.  The protocol is based on home
   agents maintaining a table similar to NAT64 and linking it to the
   binding cache.  This technique avoids the problems encountered when
   NAT64 is used for mobile nodes in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6.  How IPv6
   only mobile nodes can receive multicast data from IPv4 only content
   providers is also explained.

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6                  June 2010


1.  Introduction

   With IPv4 address depletion on the horizon, many techniques are being
   standardized for IPv6 migration including NAT64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].  NAT64 together with DNS64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] enables IPv6-only hosts to communicate with
   IPv4-only servers.

   NAT64 is designed for fixed hosts.  When used for mobile nodes
   several problems occur as described in
   [I-D.haddad-mext-nat64-mobility-harmful].  In this document we
   redesign NAT64 for host based mobility protocol called Dual Stack
   Mobile IPv6.  The design uses DNS64 as is and integrates NAT64
   operation with the binding cache of Dual Stack Mobile IPv6.

   The document continues in Section 3 with a set of requirements on a
   solution for NAT64 for Dual Stack Mobile IPv6.  In Section 4 the
   protocol design is presented, multicast translation is explained in
   Section 5 while handover and route optimization cases are covered in
   Section 6.  In Section 7 extensions to DSMIPv6 are described.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC3775], [RFC5555],
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] and [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64].


3.  Requirements

   NAT64 has two main problems if used for the mobile nodes: the first
   one is related to mobility and the second one is related to NAT keep-
   alives.  DNS64 may use the IPv6 prefix assigned to the NAT64 IPv6
   interface in the domain in translating IPv4 address of the server to
   an IPv6 address.  When the mobile node moves to a foreign network the
   IPv6 prefix changes and as a result, the mobile node gets a different
   IPv6 address for the same correspondent host it was communicating
   before.  However in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6, the mobile node is
   anchored at the home agent which receives packets reverse tunneled
   from the mobile node and sends them to their destinations.  In this
   case the packets from the home agent will likely not reach their
   destination for properly translating into IPv4 packets and will get
   dropped [I-D.haddad-mext-nat64-mobility-harmful].

   Mobile nodes in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 initiate route optimization
   with the correspondent nodes when they move to a foreign network by
   sending first a home test init (HoTI) message to the home agent.
   This and subsequent messages (Care-of Test Init (CoTI), Home Test

   (HoT) and Care-of Test (CoT)) contain IPv6 extension headers.
   NAT64's translation algorithm [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] does not
   translate IPv6 extension headers.  As a result, HoTI and similar
   messages would be rejected at the NAT64 device and the mobile node
   would end up receiving an ICMP message.  This fundamental restriction
   of IPv6-IPv4 translation is avoided in this document by an additional
   requirement not to initiate the route optimization with IPv4-only
   servers.

   NAT64 protocol should enable host mobility.  This requirement is met
   by redesigning NAT64 protocol so that the home agent which keeps
   track of the host's mobility knows about all prefixes used.

   NAT64 is a NAT device which keeps NAT table as the NAT state.  NAT
   state is soft state and it expires if it is not refreshed during a
   certain time interval.  NAT keepalives sent by the host are used for
   this purpose [RFC3519].  Mobile nodes go to sleep mode when inactive
   in which battery usage is minimized.  However sending NAT keepalive
   messages may drain the mobile node's battery because it has to cut
   short its sleep mode.

   NAT keepalives should be avoided for the mobile nodes.  This
   requirement is met by integrating NAT64 state with binding cache that
   the home agent creates for the mobile node in order to keep track of
   its mobility.

   While resolving issues of NAT64 related to mobility, it is desirable
   to keep compatibility with fixed hosts.  This requirement is met by
   reusing DNS64 for mobile nodes as well.

   The behaviour of IPv4-only or dual stack mobile nodes using host
   based mobility protocol Mobile IPv6 is specified in [RFC5555].
   However this document does not specify how IPv6-only mobile nodes can
   access IPv4-only servers.  Hence this specification complements
   [RFC5555].

   NAT64 is designed for unicast communication, the translation
   algorithm is defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] does not
   translate multicast packets.  IPv6 only hosts receiving multicast
   data from IPv4 only servers is not covered.

   For many applications multicast communication for mobile nodes in a
   dual stack Mobile IPv6 environment is a requirement.  This
   requirement is met by designing a multicast translation scheme for
   Dual Stack Mobile IPv6.  This technique applies to any source
   multicast.

4.  NAT64 Procedure

   Mobile nodes reverse tunnel their packets to the home agent when
   roaming and at the home network the home agent is the default router.
   When forwarding packets sent by the mobile node, the home agent first
   checks the Source Address field of the inner header in the binding
   cache to find the corresponding binding cache entry for this mobile
   node's home address.  A further check is made if the destination
   address's prefix matches Pref64.  In case of a match, IPv6-only flag
   in the binding cache entry for the mobile node is set if it was not
   set already.

   Home agent generates an IPv4 packet and sends it to the destination
   IPv4-only server from its IPv4 interface.  We assume that IPv4
   interface address is 203.0.113.1 as in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].  As in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful], home agent selects an
   available source port, e.g. 2000 which becomes IPv4 packet source
   port and creates a "NAT state" of

   <MN source address, IPv6 source port> <--> <IPv4 Interface address,
   IPv4 source port>

   This state is linked to the binding cache entry for MN.  In
   generating IPv4 packet, destination IPv4 address is derived from the
   the last 32 bits of destination address of IPv6 packet, e.g.
   192.0.2.1 and destination port of IPv6 packet is set to the
   destination port of IPv4 packet.  IPv6 packet is translated into an
   IPv4 packet following the algorithm presented in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate].

   When forwarding any subsequent packets for the same session
   corresponding to <MN source address, source port>, home agent finds
   the corresponding entry in the NAT table and creates the
   corresponding IPv4 packet using this entry.  The above procedure is
   repeated only when a new session is started by MN.

   When home agent receives a packet addressed to its IPv4 interface it
   searches the NAT table for the corresponding MN home address and
   port.  For example the tuple <203.0.113.1, 2000> would match the
   network-specific prefix (NSP) of 2001:FF00::/64 and the source port
   of 1500.  Home agent creates an IPv6 packet from IPv4 packet using
   this information and the translation algorithm
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate].  Next home agent fetches MN's binding
   cache entry and finds the mobile node's care-of address.  Home agent
   encapsulates IPv6 packet following [RFC3775] and sends it to the
   mobile node.

5.  Multicast Translation

   In this section we specify how mobile node can receive IPv4 multicast
   data from IPv4-only content provider based on the current multicast
   support scheme in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775].

   IPv6-only mobile node will join IPv4 multicast group by sending MLD
   Membership Report message to the home agent.  This message is sent in
   the mobile node-home agent tunnel.  Mobile node will use synthesized
   IPv6 address of IPv4 multicast group address, e.g. a /96 prefix used
   for any source multicast called IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix followed by
   a.b.c.d, IPv4 multicast group address.  IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix
   takes the form of FFxx::/96, it is non-SSM prefix
   [I-D.venaas-behave-mcast46].  Multicast router at the home agent
   receives this join message from the mobile node for the group
   IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix:a.b.c.d.

   Each home agent is assigned a unique IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix.
   Mobile nodes can learn this value by means out of scope with this
   document.  With this, mobile node can easily create an IPv6 multicast
   address from the IPv4 group address a.b.c.d that it wants to join.

   Home agent as multicast anchor checks the group address and
   recognizes IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix.  It next checks the last 32
   bits is an IPv4 multicast address in range 224/8 - 239/8.  If all
   checks succeed, home agent joins a.b.c.d using IGMP on its IPv4
   interface.

   Home agent identifies the mobile node from the tunnel and adds the
   multicast group address to the multicast state associated with this
   node's binding cache entry.  Home agent also sets IPv6-only bit if it
   was not set before.

   When home agent receives multicast data for the group a.b.c.d, it
   first obtains the IPv6 address IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix:a.b.c.d and
   then checks to see if at least one mobile node is subscribed to this
   address from the binding cache and multicast state.  Home agent will
   then translate IPv4 multicast data packet into an IPv6 multicast data
   packet.  The destination address is IPv6 group address
   IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix:a.b.c.d and source address is local
   mobility anchor's IPv6 interface address.  IPv4 payload is copied
   into IPv6 payload.  Home agent duplicates the packet for each mobile
   node member of this group and sends each packet tunneled to the
   individual mobile node separately.

   Multicast translation described in this section is not mobile node
   agnostic.  Home agent gets the join message directly from the mobile
   node and then updates the membership database which is connected to

   the binding cache.  Home agent has to know all members of each IPv4
   group so that it can correctly duplicate the data packets and tunnel
   to individual mobile nodes.


6.  Handover, Route Optimization and Return Routability

   In Dual Stack Mobile IPv6, when the mobile node leaves home it gets a
   care-of address and registers this address with its home agent.  If
   the move is within the same domain served by the same DNS64 entity
   the mobile node can continue to send/receive packets with IPv4 only
   server and the protocol defined in Section 4 can be used for
   translating IPv6 packets into IPv4 and vice versa.

   If MN moves to a domain where DNS64 entity changes and MN initiates
   communication with IPv4-only server, it gets a different synthetic
   AAAA RR with a different IPv6 address of the destination.  MN reverse
   tunnels its IPv6 packet destined to IPv4-only server to the home
   agent.

   Home agent checks the source address (mobile node's home address) of
   the inner header in the binding cache for any entry with IPv6-only
   flag set.  Next destination address's prefix is checked in a list of
   Pref64's that are supported.  In case of a match, home agent
   continues to create an IPv4 packet as described in Section 4.  In
   addition home agent also removes all NAT table entries matching MN
   home address since MN is no longer using the same Pref64.  If IPv6-
   only flag is not set then this is the first packet sent to a new
   IPv4-only server.  Home agent processes this packet as described in
   Section 4.

   The effect of handover on multicast translation described in
   Section 5 to handover depends on how IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix is
   configured.  Mobile node may get a different IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS
   prefix locally after moving to a foreign network.  Mobile node sends
   a join request (Multicast Listener Discovery Report message) with a
   new multicast group address to the home agent in a tunnel.  Home
   agent adds this group address to its membership database.  Home agent
   MUST add the new IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix to the multicast prefix
   table.  Home agent MUST set IPv6-only flag in the binding cache for
   this mobile node.

   Route optimization (RO) in DSMIPv6 is used to avoid triangular route
   every packet to the corresponding node takes by enabling the mobile
   node to directly send the packets to the correspondent node
   [RFC3775].  RO is established using control signaling involving the
   home agent, mobile node and correspondent node.  After RO is
   established mobile node sends its packets directly to the

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6                  June 2010


   correspondent node.  The source address of these packets are the
   care-of address and MN home address is included in an extension
   header called home address option.  All RO packets involve extension
   headers.

   Because all route optimization packets (signaling and data) contain
   extension headers the translation algorithm
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] used in NAT64 would simple ignore the
   data included in these headers.  As a result, route optimization can
   not even be initiated.  This point is also observed in
   [I-D.haddad-mext-nat64-mobility-harmful].  IPv6 only mobile nodes
   involved in communication with IPv4-only servers MUST NOT use route
   optimization.  This ensures that all traffic between the mobile node
   and corresponding node goes through the home agent and correct IPv6-
   IPv4 packet translation can be conducted.


7.  Extensions to Dual Stack Mobile IPv6

   Binding cache entry contains the following new entry:

   A flag indicating whether or not this mobile node is IPv6-only node.

   IPv6-only flag is set after receiving the first IPv6 packet
   containing a synthetic IPv6 address.  This flag is used to connect
   the binding cache with the NAT table.

   Home agent keeps a NAT table for IPv6-only mobile nodes communicating
   with IPv4-only servers.  NAT table contains at a minimum entries for
   associating MN home address, IPv6 source port to the corresponding
   IPv4 interface address of the home agent and source port information.

   MN home address in the NAT table MUST correspond to a binding cache
   entry with IPv6-only flag set.

   Home agent has a table of NAT64 prefixes, Pref64 that are supported
   in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 home domain and its roaming partners.  For
   each Pref64, home agent keeps a 32-bit suffix which is concatenated
   to the prefix.  The resulting 96-bit value is concatenated with IPv4
   address of the destination IPv4-only server to obtain the synthesized
   IPv6 address.

   If the Well-Known Prefix is used this table contains 64:FF9B::/96.
   In this case there is no associated suffix.

   IPv6-only mobile nodes MUST avoid initiating return routability
   procedure described in Section 5.2.5 of [RFC3775].  When the home
   agent receives a Home Test Init message, it checks the source address

   (mobile node's home address) in the binding cache.  If the
   corresponding binding cache entry has its IPv6-only flag set home
   agent drops the Home Test Init message.

7.1.  Multicast Extensions

   Multicast anchor at the home agent MUST support at least one
   IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix.  Multicast anchor at the home agent MUST
   support IGMP on its IPv4 interface.

   Home agent has a table of IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefixes.  This table
   normally contains a single entry, i.e. the local prefix value.  It
   may be populated by more entries in case of handover as described in
   Section 6.  The entries are kept as soft-state and removed after a
   period of no activity.


8.  Security Considerations

   For IPv4-only or dual stack mobile nodes security considerations
   stated in [RFC5555] apply.  This document specifies procedures for
   MIPv6 [RFC3775] for the case of IPv6-only mobile nodes which are not
   covered in [RFC5555].  Security considerations for IPv4 interface of
   the home agent is similar to [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]
   and the considerations stated there apply.


9.  IANA Considerations

   None.
