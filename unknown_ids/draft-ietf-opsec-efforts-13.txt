Internet-Draft       Security Efforts and Documents        November 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Internet is being recognized as a critical infrastructure similar
   in nature to the power grid and a potable water supply.  Just like
   those infrastructures, means are needed to provide resiliency and
   adaptability to the Internet so that it remains consistently
   available to the public throughout the world even during times of
   duress or attack.  For this reason, many SDOs are developing
   standards with hopes of retaining an acceptable level, or even
   improving this availability, to its users.  These SDO efforts usually
   define themselves as "security" efforts.  It is the opinion of the
   authors that there are many different definitions of the term
   "security" and it may be applied in many diverse ways.  As such, we
   offer no assurance that the term is applied consistently throughout
   this document.

   Many of these SDOs have diverse charters and goals and will take
   entirely different directions in their efforts to provide standards.
   However, even with that, there will be overlaps in their produced
   works.  If there are overlaps then there is a potential for conflicts
   and confusion.  This may result in:

      Vendors of networking equipment who are unsure of which standard
      to follow.

      Purchasers of networking equipment who are unsure of which
      standard will best apply to the needs of their business or
      ogranization.

      Network Administrators and Operators unsure of which standard to
      follow to attain the best security for their network.

   For these reasons, the authors wish to encourage all SDOs who have an
   interest in producing or in consuming standards relating to good
   security practices to be consistent in their approach and their
   recommendations.  In many cases, the authors are aware that the SDOs
   are making good efforts along these lines.  However, the authors do
   not participate in all SDO efforts and cannot know everything that is
   happening.

   The OpSec Working Group met at the 61st IETF and agreed that this
   document could be a useful reference in producing the documents
   described in the Working Group Charter.  The authors have agreed to
   keep this document current and request that those who read it will
   submit corrections or comments.

   Comments on this document may be addressed to the OpSec Working Group
   or directly to the authors.

2.  Format of this Document

   The body of this document has three sections.

   The first part of the body of this document, Section 3, contains a
   listing of online glossaries relating to networking and security.  It
   is very important that the definitions of words relating to security
   and security events be consistent.  Inconsistencies between the
   useage of words on standards is unacceptable as it would prevent a
   reader of two standards to appropriately relate their
   recommendations.  The authors of this document have not reviewed the
   definitions of the words in the listed glossaries so can offer no
   assurance of their alignment.

   The second part, Section 4, contains a listing of SDOs that appear to
   be working on security standards.

   The third part, Section 5, lists the documents which have been found
   to offer good practices or recommendations for securing networks and
   networking devices.

   ATIS is a United States based body that is committed to rapidly
   developing and promoting technical and operations standards for the
   communications and related information technologies industry
   worldwide using pragmatic, flexible and open approach.  Committee T1
   as a group no longer exists as a result of the recent ATIS
   reorganization on January 1, 2004.  ATIS has restructured the former
   T1 technical subcommittees into full ATIS standards committees to
   easily identify and promote the nature of standards work each
   committee performs.  Due to the reorganization, some groups may have
   a new mission and scope statement.

4.4.1.  ATIS NIPP - Network Interface, Power, and Protection Committee,
        formerly T1E1

   http://www.atis.org/0050/index.asp

   ATIS Network Interface, Power, and Protection Committee develops and
   recommends standards and technical reports related to power systems,
   electrical and physical protection for the exchange and interexchange
   carrier networks, and interfaces associated with user access to
   telecommunications networks.

4.4.2.  ATIS NPRQ - Network Performance, Reliability, and Quality of
        Service Committee, formerly T1A1

   http://www.atis.org/0010/index.asp

   ATIS Network Performance, Reliability and Quality of Service
   Committee develops and recommends standards, requirements, and
   technical reports related to the performance, reliability, and
   associated security aspects of communications networks, as well as
   the processing of voice, audio, data, image, and video signals, and
   their multimedia integration.

4.4.3.  ATIS OBF - Ordering and Billing Forum, formerly regarding T1M1
        O&B

   http://www.atis.org/obf/index.asp

   The T1M1 O&B subcommittee has become part of the ATIS Ordering and
   Billing Forum.

   pertinent to the establishment of security functionality in any
   communicating system.

5.22.  ITU-T Security Manual

   http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/edh/files/security-manual.pdf

   TSB is preparing an "ITU-T Security Manual" to provide an overview on
   security in telecommunications and information technologies, describe
   practical issues, and indicate how the different aspects of security
   in today's applications are addressed by ITU-T Recommendations.  This
   manual has a tutorial character: it collects security related
   material from ITU-T Recommendations into one place and explains the
   respective relationships.  The intended audience for this manual are
   engineers and product managers, students and academia, as well as
   regulators who want to better understand security aspects in
   practical applications.

   http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/2001-2004/com13/ngn2004/index.html

   During its January 2002 meeting, SG13 decided to undertake the
   preparation of a new ITU-T Project entitled "NGN 2004 Project".  At
   the November 2002 SG13 meeting, a preliminary description of the
   Project was achieved and endorsed by SG13 with the goal to launch the
   Project.  It is regularly updated since then.

   The role of the NGN 2004 Project is to organize and to coordinate
   ITU-T activities on Next Generation Networks.  Its target is to
   produce a first set of Recommendations on NGN by the end of this
   study period, i.e. mid-2004.

   The purpose of the Security JC is to coordinate the technical
   activities of multiple security related TCs.  The SJC is advisory
   only, and has no deliverables.  The Security JC will promote the use
   of consistent terms, promote re-use, champion an OASIS security
   standards model, provide consistent PR, and promote mutuality,

   framework for exchanging authentication and authorization
   information.

5.27.  OIF Implementation Agreements

   The OIF has 2 approved Implementation Agreements (IAs) relating to
   security.  They are:

   OIF-SMI-01.0 - Security Management Interfaces to Network Elements

   This Implementation Agreement lists objectives for securing OAM&P
   interfaces to a Network Element and then specifies ways of using
   security systems (e.g., IPsec or TLS) for securing these interfaces.
   It summarizes how well each of the systems, used as specified,
   satisfies the objectives.

   OIF - SEP - 01.1 - Security Extension for UNI and NNI

   This Implementation Agreement defines a common Security Extension for
   securing the protocols used in UNI 1.0, UNI 2.0, and NNI.

5.28.  TIA

   The TIA has produced the "Compendium of Emergency Communications and
   Communications Network Security-related Work Activities".  This
   document identifies standards, or other technical documents and
   ongoing Emergency/Public Safety Communications and Communications
   Network Security-related work activities within TIA and it's
   Engineering Committees.  Many P25 documents are specifically
   detailed.  This "living document" is presented for information,
   coordination and reference.

5.30.  NIST Special Publications (800 Series)

   http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html

   Special Publications in the 800 series present documents of general
   interest to the computer security community.  The Special Publication
   800 series was established in 1990 to provide a separate identity for
   information technology security publications.  This Special
   Publication 800 series reports on ITL's research, guidelines, and
   outreach efforts in computer security, and its collaborative
   activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.

5.31.  NIST Interagency or Internal Reports (NISTIRs)

   http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html

   NIST Interagency or Internal Reports (NISTIRs) describe research of a
   technical nature of interest to a specialized audience.  The series
   includes interim or final reports on work performed by NIST for
   outside sponsors (both government and nongovernment).  NISTIRs may
   also report results of NIST projects of transitory or limited
   interest, including those that will be published subsequently in more
   comprehensive form.

5.32.  NIST ITL Security Bulletins

   http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsITLSB.html

   ITL Bulletins are published by NIST's Information Technology
   Laboratory, with most bulletins written by the Computer Security
   Division.  These bulletins are published on the average of six times
   a year.  Each bulletin presents an in-depth discussion of a single
   topic of significant interest to the information systems community.
   Not all of ITL Bulletins that are published relate to computer /
   network security.  Only the computer security ITL Bulletins are found
   here.
