Abstract

   IETF is designing a new service called ALTO (Application Layer
   traffic Optimization) that includes a "Network Map Service", an
   "Endpoint Cost Service" and an "Endpoint (EP) Ranking Service" and
   thus incentives for application clients to connect to ISP preferred
   Endpoints.  These services provide a view of the Network Provider
   (NP) topology to overlay clients.

   The present draft proposes a light way to extend the information
   provided by the current ALTO protocol.  The purpose is to broaden the
   possibilities of the Application Clients in two ways: firstly by
   providing a better mapping of the Selected Endpoints to needs of the
   growing diversity of Content Networking Applications and to the
   network conditions, secondly by producing a more robust choice of
   multiple Endpoints, helping thus out for efficient Multi-Path
   transfer.

   There are 2 parts in this draft: the first part proposes protocol
   extensions to support requests on multiple CostTypes in 1
   transaction; the second part proposes additional CostTypes and Cost
   attributes related to timeframe and validity period.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft               multi-cost ALTO                  March 2011


1.  Introduction

   IETF is designing a new service called ALTO that provides guidance to
   P2P applications, which have to select one or several hosts from a
   set of candidates that are able to provide a desired resource.  This
   guidance shall be based on parameters that affect performance and
   efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts, e.g., the
   topological distance.  The ultimate goal is to improve Quality of
   Experience (QoE) in the application while reducing resource
   consumption in the underlying network infrastructure.  The ALTO
   protocol conveys the Internet View from the perspective of a Provider
   Network region that spans from a region to one or more Autonomous
   System (AS).  Together with this Network Map, it provides the
   Provider determined Cost Map between locations of the Network Map.
   Last, it provides the Ranking of Endpoints w.r.t. their routing cost.

   The term Network Provider in this document includes both ISPs, who
   provide means to transport the data and Content Delivery Network
   (CDN) operators who care for the dissemination, persistent storage
   and possibly identification of the best/closest content copy.

   The last ALTO protocol draft see [ID-alto-protocol6], gives the
   possibility to query multiple Endpoint properties at once (see
   S.7.7.4.1).  However section 7.7.3.2 on Cost Map states about both
   parameters Cost Type and Cost Mode that: "This parameter MUST NOT be
   specified multiple times".  The ALTO requirements draft, see
   [ID-ALTO-Requirements7] also states in REQ.  ARv05-14: "The ALTO
   client protocol MUST support the usage of several different rating
   criteria types".  In the current protocol draft, there is no
   specified way to get values for several Cost Types altogether.
   Currently, the costs are provided in a scalar form, one by one.  So
   that an ALTO Client wanting information for several Cost Types must
   place a request and receive a response as many times as desired Cost
   Types.  However, vector costs provide a robust and natural input to
   multi-path connections and getting all costs in one single query/
   response transaction saves time and ALTO traffic, thus ressources,
   thus energy.

   The ALTO Problem Statement, see [RFC5693] and the ALTO requirements
   draft, see [RFC5693] stress that: "information that can change very
   rapidly, such as transport-layer congestion, is out of scope for an
   ALTO service.  Such information is better suited to be transferred
   through an in-band technique at the transport layer instead", as
   "ALTO is not an admission control system "and does not necessarily
   know about the instant load of endpoints and links.  However, longer
   term statistics or empirical ratings on performance oriented
   information may still be useful for a reliable choice of candidate
   endpoints.  In addition, given the QoE requirements of nowadays and

Internet-Draft               multi-cost ALTO                  March 2011


   future Internet applications, more and more NPs compute and store
   such information to optimize their traffic.  Last, specific ALTO
   servers can be specified for mobile core networks, which have a
   smaller scale and can afford and take advantage of using smaller
   time-scale network information.

   Adding QoE-enabling metrics to the Network Provider established
   routing cost could meet the interests of both the end users and the
   Providers.  Besides, keeping the shortest or cheapest possible path,
   in addition, saves resources, time and energy.


2.  Scope

   This draft generalizes the case of a P2P client to include the case
   of a CDN client, a GRID application client and any Client having the
   choice in several connection points for data or resource exchange.
   To do so, it uses the term "Application Client" (AC).

   This draft focuses on the use case where the ALTO client is embedded
   in the Application Client.  For P2P applications, the use case where
   the ALTO Client is embedded in the P2P tracker is also applicable.

   It is assumed that Applications likely to use the ALTO service have a
   choice in connection endpoints as it is the case for most of them.
   The ALTO service is managed by the Network Provider and reflects its
   preferences for the choice of endpoints.  The NP defines in
   particular the network map, the routing cost among Network Locations,
   and which ALTO services are available at a given ALTO server.

   The solution proposed in this draft is applicable to fixed networks.
   It is also meant for smaller networks such as mobile networks.


3.  Terminology

   Endpoint (EP): can be a Peers, a CDN storage location, a Party in a
   resource sharing swarm such as Grid or online gaming.

   Endpoint Discovery (EP Discovery) : this term embraces the different
   types of processes used to discover different types of endpoints.

   Network provider: includes both ISPs, who provide means to transport
   the data and Content Delivery Network (CDN) who care for the
   dissemination, persistent storage and possibly identification of the
   best/closest content copy.

   Application Client (AC): this term generalizes the case of a P2P

   client to include the case of a CDN client and of any Client having
   the choice in several connection points for data or resource
   exchange.

   Traffic Engineered End Point Optimization Tool (TEEPOT): this is a
   functional entity introduced in this draft, that is linked to an ALTO
   Client and to an Application Client.  Its role is to assist the
   selection of Endpoints upon Allication needs and the ALTO responses.
   It can be a specific group of functions or an already existing
   function.


4.   Proposed ALTO services updates

   The currently available ALTO services supporting Endpoint evaluation
   are: Endpoint Cost Service, Cost Map and Filtered Cost Map. The ALTO
   client may want to simultaneously use a number N>1 of cost metrics
   referred to as Cost Types in ALTO.  The only possibility in the
   current ALTO protocol is to sequentially place as many requests as
   desired cost types.  This draft proposes to add the following
   features:

4.1.  Endpoint Cost Service with multiple Cost Types

   Some application clients may want to consider several metrics to
   select the endpoints appropriately w.r.t. the application needs.
   Clients may also want to use multiple paths for the transfer of
   particular data bulks, possibly selected with several metrics.
   Therefore the Endpoint Cost Lookup and the Cost Map Services should
   have the possibility to handle several metrics.

4.2.  All Costs Types in one response with vector cost values

   Providing all the numerical costs simultaneously with only one
   request and response exchange saves time, resources and energy.  To
   avoid overloading the network with ALTO traffic with multiple
   requests for Cost Types, we propose that the Cost values provided by
   the ALTO server be arranged in a vector.  This requires:

   o  to put the requested cost values in an array or vector having a
      number N >= 1 of components.

   o  to define a canonical order that allows to match values in these
      vectors with Cost Types and Properties.

   As specified in the ALTO Requirements [ID-ALTO-Requirements7] "REQ.
   ARv05-19: The ALTO reply message SHOULD allow the ALTO server to
   express which rating criteria have been considered when generating



Randriamasy            Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               multi-cost ALTO                  March 2011


   the reply."  That is, the ALTO response indicates the mapping between
   vector components and Cost Types.

   Note that in this case, the ALTO client MUST require the Cost Mode
   "numerical" that is the Mode MUST NOT be "ordinal".

4.3.  Proposed additional Cost Types

   The current ALTO protocol draft provides examples of metrics in
   section 5.1.1, that are: air miles, hop-counts or generic routing
   costs.  Statistics or longer term ratings on path bandwidth and
   latency may also be considered.  Additional Endpoint properties may
   be useful, such as the memory capacity or statistical scores on the
   load and possibilities of an Endpoint.

4.4.  Statistical Costs with a timeframe

   The ALTO Requirements Draft [ID-ALTO-Requirements7] advises against
   instant performance-related cost metrics as they may be easily
   captured by online mechanisms and in addition, the ALTO service does
   not know how a Peer manages its sending rate.  Application clients
   however may have good reasons and wise ways to use performance
   related information in the mid to long term ,on Endpoints that they
   don't know in advance and on which they therefore cannot plan
   measurements.  Other applications may wisely use static performance
   indicators such as nominal memory capacity.

   Dynamic performance indicators can be represented by scores,
   reflecting some overall performance, in a static way or with values
   periodically updated at intervals typically longer than a network
   layer packet RTT, as assumed in [ID-ALTO-Requirements7].

   If statistical Cost Types are available, the following types of
   information should report on them:

   o  their "statistical" nature: for example a mean value, or a median
      value,

   o  their timeframe: that is the period over which statistics were
      computed and the age of the information.  By default this
      timeframe is supposed permanent , that is, the corresponding EP
      Cost or Property values are permanent.  Timeframe information can
      be easily recovered by attributes listed in
      [ID-ALTO-Requirements7] such as 'lifetime' (see REQ.  ARv07-29)
      and an aging mechanism (see REQ.  ARv07-29), such as a RFC3339
      based TimeStamp.

   o  the validity period: indicating the date at which the information
      can be considered obsolete and updated.  This can be easily
      reflected by the 'age' reflecting the date at which the
      information was generated and 'lifetime' of this information.

   'Lifetime' and 'age' should be also available to other applicable
   'non statistical' Cost Types, such as 'OccupationLevel' that can be
   used to describe an empirical and restricted set of load value
   ranges.


5.  Proposed ALTO protocol updates

   This section proposes updates or additions to the ALTO protocol to
   support Multi Cost ALTO Services or provide additional ALTO
   information.  The applicable ALTO services are:

   o  Cost Map Service,

   o  Cost Map Filtering Service,

   o  Endpoint Property Lookup Service,

   o  Endpoint Cost Lookup Service.

5.1.  Proposed updates for Multi-Cost ALTO

   If an ALTO client desires several Cost Types, instead of placing as
   many requests as costs, it may request and receive all the desired
   cost types in one transaction.  The correspondence between the
   components and the cost type MUST be indicated in the ALTO request.

   The ALTO server then, provided it supports the desired cost, and
   provided it supports the vector cost values, sends one single
   response where for each {source, destination} pair, the cost values
   are arranged in a vector, whose component each corresponds to a
   specified Cost Type.  The correspondence between the components and
   the cost types MUST be indicated in the ALTO response.

   The following ALTO protocol services and features need to be updated
   to enable Multi Cost ALTO transactions.

   o  Endpoint (EP) Property (see [ID-alto-protocol6] )

   o  Endpoint (EP) Cost (see [ID-alto-protocol6]).

   o  Cost attributes (see [ID-alto-protocol6]).

Internet-Draft               multi-cost ALTO                  March 2011


   o  Cost Map (see [ID-alto-protocol6] ):

      *  between Network Locations (that are groups of 1 or several
         endpoints).

   o  Cost Map filtering: need the same updates as for the Cost Map.

5.1.1.  Multi-Cost related Attributes

   To enable Multi-Cost ALTO Cost Services, we propose the following
   updates to the Cost Attributes, described in [ID-alto-protocol6] .

   o  extension of the attribute Cost Type from a single value to a
      vector of N >= 1 values.  If N > 1, then the values WILL be
      interpreted as numerical values.

   o  addition of definitions that list and identify the Cost Types
      supported by the acting ALTO server.  These definitions will be
      formulated according to the syntax defined in Section 7.7 of
      [ID-alto-protocol6],

   o  definition of the correspondence between an index "i_typecost" in
      [1,N] in a cost vector and the ID of the defined cost types and
      properties.

   o  optional association of a validity timeframe, indicating how long
      the information can be considered as up to date.

      *  by default the validity timeframe WILL be considered infinite

   To the attribute Cost Mode in S.5.1: addition of a rule stipulating
   that when multiple cost types are requested, then the requested Cost
   Mode MUST be numerical.  If the attribute Cost Length is > 1 and the
   Cost Mode is set to "ordinal", then one option is that the ALTO
   Server returns the 'Sucess' code "E_INVALID_COST_TYPE".

5.2.  Proposed additional Properties and Costs

5.2.1.  Proposed additional Endpoints properties

   The Endpoint Properties given as example in [ID-alto-protocol6]
   S.3.2.3 mostly apply to fixed end nodes.  We propose to add other
   properties, that are static, contribute to reflect the potential
   physical abilities of end nodes and therefore may guide their
   selection.  In addition, these properties apply to end nodes
   connected by any access technology.  Example additional properties
   include:

Internet-Draft               multi-cost ALTO                  March 2011


   o  EP capacity in memory,

   o  EP nominal bandwidth,

   o  EP access technology.

   Note that if this service is not supported, it is possible although
   less convenient to get the information at the overlay level, thus
   without the ALTO server.

5.2.2.  Scoping ALTO information

   One way to moderate the ALTO traffic load while maintaining some
   reliability is to associate the following attributes to the
   applicable ALTO information:

   o  an age attribute indicating when the information was generated.

   o  for statistical costs a time period attribute indicating over
      which period the statistics were collected.

   o  a lifetime attribute as proposed in [ID-ALTO-Requirements7] .  By
      defaut, this parameter can be set to infinity.

   The Time related values can be used by the aging mechanism as
   proposed in REQ ARv05-28 of [ID-ALTO-Requirements7] for a better
   synchronization of Cost Information collected at various times and
   places.

5.2.3.  Proposed additional Cost Types

   Additional Cost Types may be used in either the Cost Map or the
   Endpoint Cost Lookup Services and include:

   o  Endpoint availability: indicating how often an Endpoint is
      reachable, preferebly as a percentage.  To be further specified.
      Possibly with associated Time frame and Time To Expire.

   o  Endpoint reliability: indicating how easily an Endpoint is
      reachable, and / or the degree of continuity of its reachability,
      preferebly as a percentage.  To be further specified.

   o  Endpoint Load: indicating the average load, preferably as a
      percentage, or a quantitative coarse grain index indicating
      whether this Endpoint is in a rush period or calm period.  To be
      further specified.

Internet-Draft               multi-cost ALTO                  March 2011


   o  Path robustness: one or more timeframed indicators related to
      statistical evaluations of the path performance on bandwidth,
      delay, packet loss, or other such metrics.  This Cost can also be
      represented by a quantitative coarse grain index indicating
      whether this Endpoint is in a rush period or calm period.  To be
      further specified.

5.3.  ALTO Status Codes for Multi-Cost ALTO

   If the vector cost structure is not supported, then the ALTO server
   sends an ALTO status code 7 corresponding to HTTP status code 501
   indicating "Invalid cost structure".  The ALTO client may then needs
   to place as many requests as needed Cost Types, and the ALTO server
   sends as many cost maps or EP cost as needed.

   To the attribute Cost Mode in S.5.1 should be associated a rule
   stipulating that when multiple cost types are requested, then the
   requested Cost Mode MUST be numerical.  If the attribute Cost Length
   is > 1 and the Cost Mode is set to "ordinal", an option is that the
   ALTO Server returns the 'Sucess' code "E_INVALID_COST_TYPE".

5.4.  Examples of Multi-Cost ALTO messages

   Request and Response syntax.  To be further specified.


6.  Use case

6.1.  Scenario

   A Multi-Cost ALTO transaction is illustrated in a simple scenario,
   where an application client in a terminal wants to use several paths
   for a data transfer.  This scenario applies to a terminal having
   access to the network via one or several interfaces.

   The application client wants for example 3 paths per transfer:

   o  1 path optimising the Cost Type 'routingcost',

   o  2 other paths optimizing 2 metrics: the Cost Type 'routingcost'
      and an Endpoint property named 'EP memory'.

      *  The application client in addition wants these 2 paths to
         optimize the first criterion with a weight W_PATH_LENGTH equal
         for example to 0.4 and the second criterion with a weight
         W_EP_MEMORY equal to 0.6.

      *  If the EP Property Service provides the information on Endpoint
         Load, then the application client wants this information in the
         available lifetime closest to 1 hour.

   A TEEPOT connected with the ALTO Client and the Application Client
   takes in the list of candidate Endpoints from the Application Client
   and prepares for the ALTO Client the request to the ALTO Server, in
   particular the following information: vector TimeFrame[EP Cost
   Length], with components equal to either a value or an indication of
   "not applicable".

   o  The list of requested EP Cost Types, that are identified by their
      index I_CostType.

   o

6.2.  Illustrative ALTO use case

   Figure 1 shows the example scenario in the last IETF ALTO protocol
   draft, where the ALTO client is embedded in the P2P Client and
   requires an ALTO server servicing its own ISP to provide the Endpoint
   Cost for a list of gethered peers.

   As written in [ID-alto-protocol6], the use case proceeds as follows:

   1.  The P2P Client discovers peers from sources such as Peer Exchange
       (PEX) from other P2P Clients, Distributed Hash Tables (DHT), and
       P2P Trackers.

   2.  The P2P Client queries the ALTO Server's Ranking Service,
       including discovered peers as the set of Destination Endpoints,
       and indicates the 'ordinal' Cost Mode.  The response indicates
       the ranking of the candidate peers.

   3.  The P2P Client connects to the peers in the order specified in
       the ranking.

   Figure 1:example scenario in the last IETF ALTO protocol draft, where the
   ALTO client is embedded in the P2P Client


   Figure 2 depicts the features and mechanisms added to the current
   ALTO scenario for Multi-Cost ALTO services, for the use case of
   Figure 1.  The EPs have already been discovered.  In this figure, the
   term Peer is replaced by the term Endpoint (EP), the term P2P Client
   by Application Client and an Endpoint Tracker for resource Sharing
   Applications is added to the tools involved in Step (1) Gather
   Endpoints .

   We focus on the ALTO use case where the ALTO client is co-located
   with an Application client in a terminal node, as not all P2P systems
   use a P2P tracker for peer discovery and selection as written in
   section 9.2 of [ID-alto-protocol6].  In Figure 2, the entity called
   P2P Client mentionned in the current protocol draft is zoomed to an
   entity called in this draft "Client Block" and that links: the
   Application Client (AC), its ALTO Client and the Traffic Engineered
   EP Optimization Tool (TEEPOT).

Figure 2: features and mechanisms added to the current ALTO scenario for
Multi-Cost ALTO services


   The use case in Figure 2 proceeds as follows:

   1.  The Application Client discovers Endpoints (EPs) from sources
       such as Peer Exchange (PEX) from other P2P Clients, Distributed
       Hash Tables (DHT), P2P Trackers or other types of EP trackers.

   2.  In the "Client Block" gathering the Application Client (AC), its
       ALTO Client and the Traffic Engineered EP Optimization Tool
       (TEEPOT):

       A.  the Application Client (AC) sends to the ALTO Client the list
           of the discovered peers as the set of Destination Endpoints.

       B.  the Application Client (AC) sends to the TEEPOT the
           specifications on the EPs to select, according to the needs
           of the application.  For example, AC needs 3 EPs, with 1 EP
           optimizing the Path Length Metric and 2 EPs optimizing the
           Path Length and the EP Memory Capacity Score, with respective

           weights of 0.4 and 0.6.

       C.  the TEEPOT indicates to the ALTO Client that the Service to
           request is EP Cost, with the Cost Mode set to "Numerical",
           and the Cost Dimension equal to the number of requested
           metrics and with the index of the requested Cost Types.

   3.  The ALTO Client queries the ALTO Server's EP Cost Service, sends
       the list of the discovered peers as the set of Destination
       Endpoints and the index of requested metrics, corresponding in
       this example to: "Path Length" and "EP Memory Capacity Score".
       As the number of requested metrics is > 1, the Cost Mode is
       implicitely set to 'numerical'.  The ALTO Server response
       contains the set of metric values associated to each EP.

   4.  In the Client block:

       A.  The ALTO Client hands to the TEEPOT the list of EPs and their
           associated value set.

       B.  The TEEPOT ranks the EPs with some smart algorithm, given the
           metric weights and then sends the ranked list to the
           Application Client.

   5.  The Application Client connects to the selected EPs.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The current ALTO protocol version includes a Section 11 entitled IANA
   considerations, where the ALTO Cost Type registry is defined in
   Section 11.2

7.1.  Information for IANA on proposed Cost Types

   When a new ALTO Cost Type is defined, accepted by the ALTO working
   group and requests for IANA registration MUST include the following
   information, detailed in Section 11.2: Identifier, Intended
   Semantics, Security Considerations.

7.2.  Information for IANA on proposed Endpoint Propeeries

   Likewise, an ALTO Endpoint Property Registry could serve the same
   purposes as the ALTO Cost Type registry.  Application to IANA
   registration for Endpoint Properties would follow a similar process.
