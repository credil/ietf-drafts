	<t>This document defines common requirements of multiple types of Large Scale
Network Address Translation (NAT) that handles Unicast UDP, TCP and ICMP.</t>
   </abstract>
 </front>

   <section title="Introduction">
	 <t>
Now there are several IPv4 address sharing schemes such as Large Scale NAT (as known as NAT444<xref target="I-D.shirasaki-nat444-isp-shared-addr" />) , DS-Lite<xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite" />, A+P<xref target="I-D.ymbk-aplusp" /> and so on under the discussion.
	</t>

	<t>
Those IPv4 address sharing schemes are intended to be used in the middle of the ISP access network against IPv4 address shortage problem by sharing one global IPv4 address by multiple users. Authors believe that there are common requirements among all IPv4 address sharing schemes to make them "transparent" as much as possible.
At the BEHAVE working group of IETF, following RFCs have already defined to achieve maximum transparency at the residential CPE which has NAT function;
	</t>

	<t>
   	<list style='empty'>
		<t>
- RFC4787 : NAT Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP
		</t>
		<t>
- RFC5382 : NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP
		</t>
		<t>
- RFC5508 : NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP
		</t>
	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
However so, because those RFCs are mainly aimed at residential CPE and any IPv4 address sharing schemes are a bit different from it, we believe that requirements for LSN and other schemes should be defined alternatively to those RFCs.

  LSN external Identifier in communication between CPE and GGN
  external.

<section title="The policy of assignment of LSN external IP address, port and identifier">

	<t>
	A LSN has a pool of LSN external IP addresses, ports and identifiers. CPEs share LSN 
	external IP addresses. Each LSN occupies combination of LSN  external IP address, LSN external port and LSN external identifier exclusively. For a fair use of limited resources, LSN has a limitation for the 
	number of the LSN external ports per CPE. LSNs need to keep high transparency to continue 
	existing services after LSN is introduced. Requirement of high transparency for LSN 
	leads to high scalability of LSN. High transparency means LSN basically keeps communications 
	among CPEs except effect of limitations of the number of LSN external ports and TCP sessions.
	</t>
    	
	<t>
    	 A CPE MAY apply UDP hole punching or TCP hole punching for interactive services among CPEs like Voice over IP and P2P. 
	LSN SHOLUD NOT interfere in services using UDP hole punching or TCP hole punching.
	</t>
   	
	<t>REQ-1: A LSN MUST allocate one external IP address to each CPE.
		<list style="empty">
			<t>a) LSN external IP address allocated to the CPE MUST be same for the UDP, TCP and ICMP.
			</t>
		</list>
	</t>

	<t>
   	Justification: If a LSN allocates multiple LSN external IP addresses to each CPE, some applications might not work.
	</t>
   	
	<t>
   	REQ-2: A LSN MUST allocate LSN external ports which is mapped for CPE ports of UDP.
		<list style='empty'>
    	
			<t>
   	 	a) A LSN MUST NOT overload LSN external port while a NAT UDP mapping timer does not expire. 
    	</t>
    		
			<t>
  	 	b) A LSN MAY reuse LSN external port after a NAT UDP mapping timer expires.
  	 	</t>
   		
			<t> 
   		c) A LSN SHOULD limit the number of the LSN external ports of UDP per CPE.
   		</t>
   		
			<t>
   		d) The number of the LSN external ports of UDP per CPE which LSN can allocate SHOULD be 
		configurable for the administrator of LSN.
   		</t>
   		
		</list>	
	</t>

  <t>
   	Justification: CPEs can communicate to CPE external realm fairly by limiting the number of LSN external ports per CPE.
  </t>

	<t>
   	REQ-3: A LSN MUST allocate LSN external ports which is mapped for CPE ports of TCP.
   	

		<list style='empty'>
   		<t>
  		a)  A LSN MUST NOT overload LSN external port while the port is allocated for one or more  
			TCP sessions originated by another CPE.
   		</t>

   		<t>
  		b) A LSN MAY reuse LSN external port while the port is allocated for no session originated  by any CPE.
   		</t>

   		<t>
  		c) A LSN SHOULD limit the number of the LSN external ports of TCP per CPE.
   		</t>

   		<t>
  		d) The number of the LSN external ports of TCP per CPE SHOULD be an administratively  configurable option.
   		</t>

   		<t>
  		e)  A LSN SHOULD limit the number of the new sessions of TCP per time unit and per CPE.
   		</t>  

		</list>
	</t>   
   	
	<t>
  	Justification: CPEs can communicate to CPE external realm fairly by limiting the number of LSN external 
	ports per CPE. In addition, TCP LSN external port MAY have TCP sessions, and therefore the 
	TCP session timer is necessary for every 5-Tuple. LSN can have not only the limitations of the number of 
	LSN external ports but also TCP sessions per CPE. Thus a LSN can prevent denial of service attacks with the tons of 
	TCP open and close by malicious CPEs. 
	</t>	

	<t>
  	REQ-4: A LSN MUST allocate LSN external identifiers which is mapped for CPE identifiers of ICMP.

		<list style='empty'>
  		<t>
  		a) A LSN MUST NOT overload LSN external identifier before an ICMP Query session timer expires.
  		</t>

  		<t>
  		b) A LSN MAY reuse LSN external identifier after an ICMP Query session timer expires.
  		</t>

  		<t>
  		c) A LSN SHOULD limit the number of the LSN external identifier allocated per CPE.
  		</t>

  		<t>
  		d) The number of the LSN external identifiers per CPE which LSN can allocate SHOULD be an administratively configurable option.
			</t>
		</list>

	</t>
 	<t>
 	Justification: CPEs can communicate to CPE external realm fairly by limiting the number of LSN external identifiers every CPE. 
	</t>

	<t>
If a CPE has already consumed many LSN external ports, the CPE might not use new ports because LSNs limit the number of ports.
 	</t>

	<t>
REQ-5: A LSN MAY have implementations that some specific applications can work well even if each CPE's usable number of LSN external ports have already consumed.
	</t>
	<t>
Justification: Some specific applications don't work well due to limitation of number of number of ports by LSN, therefore other applications might be affected in the same CPE.

	</t>

In Section 8 we discuss in detail.

<section title="Requirements for UDP">

	<t> <xref target="RFC4787" /> describes requirements of the Unicast UDP of a NAT, and the behavior of  
       "Endpoint-Independent Filtering "is RECOMMNEDED, and a  NAT MUST have an "Endpoint-Independent 
         Mapping" behavior to ensure transparency of LSN. 
	</t>

	<t>
	To have "Endpoint-Independent Filtering" and "Endpoint-Independent Mapping" behaviors     
   	for LSNs, LSNs help to establish UDP Hole Punching among CPEs.
    	In other words, the possibility of the establishment of UDP Hole Punching among CPEs which 
    	have LSN is equal to the possibility among CPEs which don's t have LSN. If LSNs have an  
    	"Address-Dependent Mapping" or "Address and Port-Dependent Mapping" behavior, the possibility  that 
	establishment of UDP Hole Punching is less than when LSNs have an "Endpoint-Independent  
	Mapping" behavior.  If LSNs have an "Address and Port-Dependent Filtering" behavior, the possibility that  
    	establishment of UDP Hole Punching is less than when LSNs have an "Endpoint-Independent Filtering" or "Address 
	Dependent Filtering" behavior.

If a LSN supports NAT Hairpinning, a CPE can communicate other CPEs in LSN internal realm of the same LSN.

			</t>
	
		</list>
	</t>
	<t>
      Justification: LSN which is placed at ISP/Carrier makes much of
      transparency.  In particular, for applications that receive media
      simultaneously from multiple locations (e.g., gaming), or
      applications that use rendezvous techniques.  But to be more
      precise, in the LSN case, it may not be needed for some specific
      protocol such as DNS query and response.
    </t>



</section>




<section title="Requirements for TCP">

	<t>
     	<xref target="RFC5382" /> describes requirements of TCP of a NAT, and the behavior of 
	"Endpoint-Independent Filtering" is RECOMMNEDED, and a NAT MUST have an "Endpoint-Independent

  </t>

	<t>

	</t>
	
	<t>
	REQ-7: A LSN SHOULD comply with <xref target="RFC5382" /> for TCP, unless a) applies. 
		<list style='empty'>

			<t>
a) It is RECOMMENDED that a NAT have an "Endpoint independent filtering" behavior for TCP.
			</t>

			<t>Status: "If application transparency is most important, it is RECOMMENDED that a NAT have an "Endpoint independent filtering" behavior for TCP.  If a more stringent filtering behavior is most important, it is RECOMMENDED that a NAT have an "Address dependent filtering" behavior." is REQ-3 in RFC5382.
			</t>
		</list>
	</t>

	<t>
Justification: LSN which is placed at ISP/Carrier makes much of transparency. But to be more precise, in the LSN case, it may not be needed for some specific protocols.
	</t>

</section>


<section title="Requirements for ICMP">
	
	<t> 
	<xref target="RFC5508" /> describes requirements of ICMP of a NAT. 
	And there MAY be a case that CPE cannot establish communication from CPEs to LSN external 
	realm because LSN limits the number of LSN external ports, identifiers 
	and TCP sessions per CPE. It is useful if CPE can distinguish an error to occur by the limitation of the 
	LSN external ports, identifiers and TCP sessions from other errors.
	</t>

	<t>
	REQ-8: A LSN SHOULD comply with <xref target="RFC5508" /> for ICMP.
	</t>

	<t>
	Justification: LSN SHOULD have to keep high transparency for ICMP. And CPE MAY use P2P and interactive 	
	services between CPEs after a LSN is introduced. 
	</t>


	<t>
Therefore, written in <xref target="RFC5508" />, when a LSN can't establish new session of TCP/UDP by limiting of TCP/UDP ports per user, the LSN sends an ICMP destination
      unreachable message, with code of 13 (Communication
      administratively prohibited) to the sender.

	</t>


</section>






<section title=" Identifying particular users (BOTs, spammers, etc)">
	<t>
It is necessary for network administrators to identify a user
from an IP address and a timestamp in order to deal with abuse
and lawful intercept. When multiple users share one external
address at LSN, the source address and the source port that
are visible at the destination host are translated ones.
The following mechanisms can be used to identify the user that
transmitted a certain packet.
	</t>
	
	<section title="Store Translation Log">
		<t>
One mechanism stores the following information at LSN.
		</t>
		<t>
		<list style="empty">
<t>- destination address</t>
<t>- destination port</t>
<t>- translated source address</t>
<t>- translated source port</t>
<t>- untranslated source address</t>
<t>- untranslated source port</t>
<t>- timestamp</t>
		</list>
		</t>
		<t>
In such environment that one LSN accommodates a lot of users or
processes large amount of traffic, the amount of log will be
so large and the operator has to prepare large volume of storage.
		</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Fixed port assignment">
		<t>
To save costs for storage, one can adopt this port assignment
mechanism at LSN. By fixing the range of external port per user/CPE,
and having the mapping of internal IP address to external IP
address and port, there will be no need to store per session log.
Note that this mechanism is possible only if the source
port is known as well as the source address, the destination
address and the destination port.
		</t>
	</section>
</section>


<section anchor="port_limitation" title="Considerations about limiting the number of LSN external ports">
	<t>
 	As discussed in section 3,4 and 5, LSN limits the number of LSN external ports and identifier per CPE. Therefore some important applications like DNS might not work well due to applications consuming many LSN external ports.
</t>

There are two ways to solve this issue.
The one is that particular applications are out of the targets for the number of port limitation for LSN.
In the case, the applications should be configurable for the administrator of LSN.
</t>
 	<t>
The other is that LSN doesn't translate address or port for some specific applications, moreover it doesn't limit the number of LSN external ports.(we call "LSN pass-through")
Therefore, LSN behave as a router.
In this case, some specific applications are out of limitation for the number of LSN external ports.
Some applications, which don't work well due to address translation like FTP, is effective.
Reducing costs of translation is also effective.
As a condition, administrators of LSN can control SPS which become a target of LSN pass-through.

No matter which solutions you choose, you should consider which applications you are out of limitation target for the number of LSN external ports.
When you choose too many applications, this might cause LSNs large load.

	If malicious CPE can camouflage CPE 3-Tuple, the malicious CPE MAY prevent a normal 
	CPE from sending data to external realm. 
	Therefore, an operator SHOULD make policies to prevent a spoofing of CPE 3-tuple.
