    <abstract>
      <t>After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated
      by the emergency caller or normally by the call-taker) it is possible
      that the call-taker feels the need for further communication or for a
      clarification. For example, the call may have been dropped by accident
      without the call-taker having sufficient information about the current
      situation of a wounded person. A call-taker may trigger a callback
      towards the emergency caller using the contact information provided with
      the initial emergency call. This callback could, under certain
      circumstances, then be treated like any other call and as a consequence,
      it may get blocked by authorization policies or may get forwarded to an
      answering machine.</t>

      <t>The IETF emergency services architecture addresses callbacks in a
      limited fashion and thereby covers a couple of scenarios. This document
      discusses some shortcomings and illustrates an extension.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Summoning police, the fire department or an ambulance in emergencies
      is one of the fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone. As
      telephone functionality moves from circuit-switched telephony to
      Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that this core
      functionality will continue to work at least as well as it has for the
      legacy technology. New devices and services are being made available
      that could be used to make a request for help, which are not traditional
      telephones, and users are increasingly expecting them to be used to
      place emergency calls.</t>

      <t>Regulatory requirements demand that the emergency call itself
      provides enough information to allow the call-taker to initiate a call
      back to the emergency caller in case the call dropped or to interact
      with the emergency caller in case of further questions. Such a call,
      referred as PSAP callback subsequently in this document, may, however,
      be blocked or forwarded to an answering machine as SIP entities (SIP
      proxies as well as the SIP UA itself) cannot associate the potential
      importantance of the call based on the SIP signaling.</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>Note that the authors are, however, not aware of regulatory
          requirements for providing preferential treatment of callbacks
          initiated by the call-taker at the PSAP towards the emergency
          caller.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Section 10 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework"></xref>
      discusses the identifiers required for callbacks, namely AOR URI and a
      globally routable URI in a Contact: header. Section 13 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework"></xref> provides the following
      guidance regarding callback handling:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>A UA may be able to determine a PSAP call back by examining the
          domain of incoming calls after placing an emergency call and
          comparing that to the domain of the answering PSAP from the
          emergency call. Any call from the same domain and directed to the
          supplied Contact header or AoR after an emergency call should be
          accepted as a call-back from the PSAP if it occurs within a
          reasonable time after an emergency call was placed.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This approach mimics a stateful packet filtering firewall and is
      indeed helpful in a number of cases. It is also relatively simple to
      implement. Below, we discuss a few cases where this approach fails.</t>

      <section title="Routing Asymmetry">
        <t>In some deployment environments it is common to have incoming and
        outgoing SIP messaging to use different routes.</t>

      <section title="Multi-Stage Resolution">
        <t>Consider the following emergency call routing scenario shown in
        <xref target="stages"></xref> where routing towards the PSAP occurs in
        several stages. An emergency call uses a SIP UA that does not run LoST
        on the end point. Hence, the call is marked with the 'urn:service:sos'
        Service URN <xref target="RFC5031"></xref>. The user's VoIP provider
        receives the emergency call and determines where to route it. Local
        configuration or a LoST lookup might, in our example, reveal that
        emergency calls are routed via a dedicated provider FooBar and
        targeted to a specific entity, referred as esrp1@foobar.com. FooBar
        does not handle emergency calls itself but performs another resolution
        step to let calls enter the emergency services network and in this
        case another resolution step takes place and esrp-a@esinet.org is
        determined as the recipient, pointing to an edge device at the
        IP-based emergency services network. Inside the emergency services
        there might be more sophisticated routing taking place somewhat
        depending on the existing structure of the emergency services
        infrastructure.</t>

        <t>The mechanism described in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework"></xref> assumes that all devices at
        the call signaling path store information about the domain of the
        communication recipient. This is necessary to match the stored domain
        name against the domain of the sender when an incoming call
        arrives.</t>

        <t>However, the IETF emergency services architecture also considers
        those cases where the resolution from the Service URN to the PSAP URI
        happens somewhere in the network rather than immediately at the end
        point itself. In such a case, the end device is therefore not able to
        match the domain of the sender with any information from the outgoing

    <section anchor="arch" title="Architecture">
      <t><xref target="parameter"></xref> describes how to mark a call as a
      callback. However, the pure emergency service callback marking is
      insufficient since it lacks any built-in security mechanism.
      Fortunately, available SIP security techniques for the purpose of
      authorization can be re-used, as described in the rest of the
      section.</t>

      <t>In <xref target="identity-authz"></xref> an interaction is presented
      that allows a SIP entity to make a policy decision whether to bypass
      installed authorization policies and thereby providing preferential
      treatment. To make this decision the sender's identity is compared with
      a whitelist of valid PSAPs. The identity assurances in SIP can come in
      different forms, such as SIP Identity <xref target="RFC4474"></xref> or
      with P-Asserted-Identity <xref target="RFC3325"></xref>. The former
      technique relies on a cryptographic assurance and the latter on a chain
      of trust.</t>

      <t>The establishment of a whitelist with PSAP identities is
      operationally complex and does not easily scale world wide. When there
      is a local relationship between the VSP/ASP and the PSAP then populating
      the whitelist is far simpler.</t>

      <t>An alternative approach to an identity based authorization model is
      outlined in <xref target="trait"></xref>. In fact, RFC 4484 <xref
      target="RFC4484"></xref> already illustrated the basic requirements for
      this technique.</t>

      <t>In a trait-based authorization scenario an incoming SIP message
      contains a form of trait, i.e. some form of assertion. The assertion
      contains an indication that the sending party has the role of a PSAP (or
      similar emergency services entity). The assertion is either
      cryptographically protected to enable end-to-end verification or an
      chain of trust security model has to be assumed. In <xref
      target="trait"></xref> we assume an end-to-end security model where
      trust anchors are provisioned to ensure the ability for a SIP entity to
      verify the received assertion.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document defines a callback marking scheme using URI parameters
      and illustrates how to handle authorization for preferential treatment.
      The URI parameter that is included for a URI MUST be used in concert
      with either the PAI <xref target="RFC3325"></xref> or the SIP Identity
      <xref target="RFC4474"></xref> header. A pure From header does not
      provide security assurance that the calling party is indeed a PSAP.</t>

      <t>An important aspect from a security point of view is the relationship
      between the emergency services network and the VSP (assuming that the
      emergency call travels via the VSP and not directly between the SIP UA
      and the PSAP). If there is some form of relationship between the
      emergency services operator and the VSP then the identification of a
      PSAP call back is less problematic than in the case where the two
      entities have not entered in some form of relationship that would allow
      the VSP to verify whether the marked callback message indeed came from a
      legitimate source.</t>

      <t>The main attack surface can be seen in the usage of PSAP callback
      marking to bypass blacklists, ignore call forwarding procedures and
      similar features to interact with users and to get their attention. For
      example, using PSAP callback marking devices would be able to recognize
      these types of incoming messages leading to the device overriding user
      interface configurations, such as vibrate-only mode. As such, the
      requirement is to ensure that the mechanisms described in this document
      can not be used for malicious purposes, including SPIT.</t>

      <t>A SIP entity MAY treat the call as a normal incoming call if it
      considers the request with the included URI parameter to be fraudulent,
      i.e. if it does not recognize the originator, or the domain from where
      the call originated from as being trusted/owned by a PSAP. It is NOT
      RECOMMENDED to drop a call that is marked as PSAP callback in such a
      case since this may severely impact the ability for calltakers at PSAPs
      to contact emergency callers.</t>
