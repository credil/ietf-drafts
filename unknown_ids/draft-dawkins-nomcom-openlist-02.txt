Internet-Draft                NomCom Issues                February 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), the Internet
   Architecture Board (IAB), and at-large IETF representatives to the
   IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) are selected by a
   "Nominating and Recall Committee" (universally abbreviated as
   "NomCom").  [RFC3777] defines how the NomCom is selected, and the
   processes it follows as it selects candidates for these positions.

   The NomCom is responsible for filling positions across the breadth of
   the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  The NomCom needs
   relevant information about nominees being considered for these
   positions, but current [RFC3777] requirements for confidentiality
   limit the ability of the NomCom to solicit that information.  The
   process change described in this document allows the NomCom to openly
   solicit information about willing nominees.


2.  Current Rules on Confidentiality

   [RFC3777] is the latest in a series of revisions to the NomCom
   process.

   [RFC3777] describes the confidental nature of NomCom deliberations in
   section 3, "General", bullet 6, which states:

      All deliberations and supporting information that relates to
      specific nominees, candidates, and confirmed candidates are
      confidential.

      The nominating committee and confirming body members will be
      exposed to confidential information as a result of their
      deliberations, their interactions with those they consult, and
      from those who provide requested supporting information.  All
      members and all other participants are expected to handle this
      information in a manner consistent with its sensitivity.

      It is consistent with this rule for current nominating committee
      members who have served on prior nominating committees to advise
      the current committee on deliberations and results of the prior
      committee, as necessary and appropriate.


3.  Problems with Existing Rules

   There are two problems with existing practice - nominee lists aren't
   as confidential as [RFC3777] would lead the reader to believe, but
   they aren't visible to the entire IETF community, either.



Dawkins                  Expires August 30, 2009                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                NomCom Issues                February 2009


   Since at least 1996, most NomComs have sent out a "short list" of
   nominees under consideration to a variety of audiences.  The target
   audiences differ from year to year, but have included members of
   specific leadership bodies, working group chairs in a specific area
   (for IESG positions), and all working group chairs (for IAB and IAOC
   positions).  "All working group chairs" includes multiple hundreds of
   recipients.

   This practice is unavoidable, because most NomCom members will not
   have personal experience with most nominees for most positions, but
   it is periodically challenged because it's not explicitly allowed as
   an exception to the blanket requirement for confidentiality.

   In an attempt to maintain the required level of confidentiality, past
   NomComs have also included "ringers" on the short list - nominees who
   have notified NomCom that they are NOT willing to serve.  Since
   anyone who sees the short list does not know who the ringers are,
   consciencious IETF participants also provide feedback on nominees who
   have already declined.  This is a waste of precious IETF-participant
   cycles, and Joel Halpern (2008-2009 NomCom Chair) reports that "the
   ringer pool leaks like a sieve" - it's also ineffective.

   We also note that the practice of publishing a "short list" penalizes
   IETF participants who aren't members of one of the audiences being
   surveyed - they have no way of knowing who is being considered,
   except for incumbent(s), and have little incentive to provide
   feedback to NomCom on individuals who might not even be nominees.


4.  Asking the Entire Community for Feedback

   We take it as given that for today's NomComs, members will not likely
   have personal experience with all nominees for all positions under
   review.

   We assume that asking the larger community for feedback about these
   nominees is preferable to NomCom members without personal experience
   simply deferring to the members of the NomCom who DO have personal
   experience with specific nominees.

   We assume that asking for feedback from the entire community is
   preferable to asking for feedback from specific segments of the
   community.


5.  Publishing an Accurate Nominee List

   In proposing that an accurate nominee list be published as part of



Dawkins                  Expires August 30, 2009                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                NomCom Issues                February 2009


   NomCom's request for feedback from the community, we considered three
   possibilities:

   1.  Asking for feedback on all nominees, whether they are willing to
       serve or not.
   2.  Asking for feedback on all nominees who are willing to serve.
   3.  Asking for feedback on the nominees that NomCom is seriously
       considering (the "short list").

   Asking for feedback on nominees who are not willing to serve is a
   waste of precious IETF-participant cycles, and may make it less
   likely that NomCom would receive feedback on some nominees who ARE
   willing to serve.

   Asking for feedback on all nominees who are willing to serve allows
   the community to point out specific strengths and weaknesses of all
   nominees, and this feedback should be useful to NomCom in deciding
   which nominees to seriously consider.  It also allows NomCom to
   receive feedback on nominees who might not appear on a "short list"
   initially, in the event that a strong nominee is suddenly unwilling
   or unable to serve.

   We also note that the list of willing nominees would include
   incumbents who are willing to serve an additional term.


6.  Concerns About Open Nominee Lists

   This section acknowledges possible concerns about publishing open
   nominee lists in previous discussions.

   It is possible that nominees who are willing to be considered if the
   nominee list is not published, would not be willing to be considered
   if the nominee list is published.  This reluctance might be the
   result of personal pride, or the result of the fear of retribution,
   for a nominee being considered as a replacement for the nominee's
   managing Area Director (this concern is usually raised in an IESG
   context).

   Spencer's personal opinion is that if retribution for willingness to
   be considered for IETF leadership positions is a serious concern, we
   have bigger problems than nominee list confidentiality, and Spencer
   notes that it's called the "Nominating AND RECALL Committee" for a
   reason.

   We note that (for example) the Internet Architecture Board publishes
   the nominee list for their representative to the Internet Society
   Board of Trustees, without apparent ill effects.

Internet-Draft                NomCom Issues                February 2009


   It is possible that publishing the nominee list publicly would lead
   to "lobbying", public statements supporting nominees on the IETF
   mailing list, etc.

   Rather than trying to prohibit specific "undesirable" behaviors, we
   trust that NomCom would focus on factual feedback, rather than on
   statements of support, in its deliberations.

   We note that nominees know they are under consideration and can
   "lobby" today, by telling people they are willing to serve and asking
   them to provide feedback to NomCom.  Several nominees (both
   incumbents and non-incumbents) have posted statements of candidacy to
   the IETF Discussion mailing list, for example.


7.  Updated text from RFC 3777

   At the end of the three paragraphs in [RFC3777], section 3,
   "General", bullet 6, which are currently:

      All deliberations and supporting information that relates to
      specific nominees, candidates, and confirmed candidates are
      confidential.

      The nominating committee and confirming body members will be
      exposed to confidential information as a result of their
      deliberations, their interactions with those they consult, and
      from those who provide requested supporting information.  All
      members and all other participants are expected to handle this
      information in a manner consistent with its sensitivity.

      It is consistent with this rule for current nominating committee
      members who have served on prior nominating committees to advise
      the current committee on deliberations and results of the prior
      committee, as necessary and appropriate.

   add the following paragraphs:

      The list of nominees willing to serve in positions under review in
      the current NomCom cycle is not confidential.  The NomCom will
      publish the list of names of all willing nominees to the
      community, in order to obtain feedback from the community on these
      nominees.  The list of nominees published should not contain
      nominees who have not indicated a willingness to serve in the
      position(s) under review.

      The published list is intended to be published as a complete list,
      but the NomCom may publish an updated list if the NomCom
      identifies errors/omissions in a previously-published version of
      the public list, or if the NomCom finds it necessary to call for
      additional nominees, and these nominees indicate a willingness to
      serve in time to be considered by the NomCom.


8.  Security Considerations

   This specification describes issues with the current IETF Nominating
   Committee process ([RFC3777]) and proposes an update to allow the
   NomCom to solicit feedback on willing nominees from the entire
   community.  No security considerations apply.


9.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are requested in this specification.
