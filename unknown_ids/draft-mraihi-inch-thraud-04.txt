 1. Introduction 
     
     
    Financial institutions and merchants are confronted with online 
    fraud attacks targeted against their customers through various 
    means. Today there is no standardized data format and open protocol 
    that organizations and law enforcement can use to share 
    known/suspicious transaction fraud data. 
     
    There is a clear opportunity for creating an open framework to 
    enable organizations, using a variety of fraud monitoring products, 
    to contribute information related to known or suspicious fraud 
    activity. The very same framework should also formalize mechanisms 
    for distributing correlated updates to all participating members.  
     
    This internet draft introduces a data format to facilitate 
    interoperability and exchange of transaction-related fraud data.  
     
    More specifically, this document describes a data-format and 
    protocol for defining and exchanging Transaction Fraud (Thraud) 
    Report Data. It extends the IODEF XML [IODEF] incident 
    reporting Format. 
     
    Any verified organization can contribute online fraud attack 
    records via openly defined protocols. A verified organization is 
    one that has been authenticated and is authorized to provide fraud 
    related data. Verification procedures and the specific requirements
    for authorization are outside the scope of this specification.
     
    The specific focus of this document is the proposal of an XML schema
    definition for Fraud Reports and the protocols by which they can 
    be exchanged. The document proposes a definition for both nbound 
    (Thraud Reports) and outbound (Thraud Watchlists) mechanisms. 
     
    In section 3 we introduce the different components of a transaction 
    fraud. The reporting method via an IODEF-Document is described in 
    section 4, and we define the report elements in section 5. In the 
    next section we describe the required elements with respect to the 
    IODEF format and follow with security considerations in section 7.

 2. Requirements Terminology 
     
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
    this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119

    Transaction Fraud Activities are normally composed of the following 
    entities: 
     
        1. The Fraudsters are those who collect victim's login 
          credentials via various means, such as phishing, malware etc. 
          and then verify (usually through login attempts) that those 
          credentials are correct. At that time Fraudsters may either 
          recruit Fraud executors directly or wholesale the collected 
          credentials to other Fraudsters who will do the recruiting of 
          the Fraud executors. 
     
        2. The Fraud Executors are those that actually will attempt the 
          fraudulent transfer or payment. For fraudulent transfers, 
          legitimate accounts at the same financial organization or a 
          different one from the victim will be set up as the 
          destination account for the fraudulent transfer. 
          Alternatively a fraudulent payment attempt via check or 
          electronic transfer to a named destination is attempted. 
        3. The Victims of both credential theft and transaction fraud. 
        4. The Financial Organization who holds either the 
          victim/fraudster's accounts. 
        5. Sensors at the Financial Organization who attempt to detect 
          fraudulent transaction attempts, either in realtime or 
          offline. 
     
    The intention of Thraud Reporting is to enable any organization 
    that has detected fraud to share this information with other 
    organizations. The receiving organization can use this information 
    appropriately. For example, it could require manual review of 
    transactions from 'risky' IP addresses that have been reported. 
     
 4. Thraud Activity Reporting via an IODEF-Document Incident 
          
    A Thraud Activity Report is an instance of an XML IODEF-Document. 
    Generally, these reports include added EventData.AdditionalData 
    elements. The added elements compose a ThraudRecord Element. There 
    may be multiple ThraudRecord Elements in a Thraud Activity Report. 
    Required information with many optional items is populated into the 
    ThraudRecord structure to a form a Thraud Activity Report. If the 
    Thraud Activity Report describes a particular pattern of 
    behaviour,or fraud event signature as described in section 6.3, 
    rather than a specific fraud event, these additional elements may 
    not be included.  
     
    There are actually two types of Thraud Activity Reports an 
    "inbound" and an "outbound" report. The "inbound" report is from a 
    reporting organization to describe a transaction fraud. The 
    "outbound" report is destined to subscribers, either through a

    subscription or following a query to obtain (possibly correlated) 
    information about fraud elements. Any correlation of information 
    that is subsequently distributed via subscription or query is 
    outside the scope of this specification.
     
    The primary difference in the "inbound" and "outbound" reports is 
    the removal in the "outbound" reports of reporting organization 
    information in order to protect confidentiality. We elaborate on 
    this aspect in section 7, Security Considerations.  
     
    This document defines new EventData IODEF XML elements; then 
    identifies the attributes that are required in a compliant Thraud 
    Activity Report. It also makes use of the IODEF POSTAL type for 
    postal addresses, the XML DECIMAL type for financial amounts and 
    defines a "currency" type to indicate the three character currency 
    code as per [ISO 4217]. The Appendicies contain sample Thraud 
    Activity Reports and the complete XML schema.  
     
    The Incident element with fraud extensions is summarized below. It 
    provides a standardized representation for commonly exchanged 
    incident data. 
     
    For "inbound" reports it contains a unique identifier that is name 
    spaced qualified by the domain name of the reporting organization. 
    In "outbound" reports it contains an opaque unique identifier to 
    protect privacy of data sources. The data elements in this document 
    are expressed in Unified Modeling Language (UML) syntax [UML].

 How to Share Transaction Fraud (Thraud) Report Data       November 2007 
  
  
    A Thraud Activity Report is composed of one IODEF Incident element, 
    containing one or more EventData elements that contain one or more 
    ThraudRecord elements. 
     
    This document describes ThraudRecord elements for the EventData. 
    AdditionalData element containing transaction fraud-related 
    information that does not map to existing Incident or EventData 
    attributes. 
     
    One Incident report may contain information on multiple incidents. 
    After the report identification information listed in the Incident 
    element, each individual transaction fraud event is detailed within 
    a single EventData structure. 
     
 5. Fraud Report Class Definitions 
     
    A fraud report consists of an extension to the 
    Incident.EventData.AdditionalData Element. The contents of the 
    extension are associated with the dtype value 'xml'. The components 
    of the fraud report identify and capture information related to 
    payment fraud, transfer fraud, identity fraud and other types of 
    fraud. 
     
    A payment fraud report is structured as follows. 
     
       +--------------------------+ 
       | EventData.AdditionalData | 
       +--------------------------+ 
       | ENUM dtype (xml)         |<>---------[ FraudEventPayment ]

    5.1. The FraudEventPayment class 
     
    The FraudEventPayment class is used to report the payee 
    instructions for a fraudulent payment or fraudulent payment 
    attempt. Fraudsters sometimes use the same payee instructions 
    (including the amount) for multiple fraudulent payment attempts. By 
    reporting the payment instructions used in the fraud, other 
    institutions may be able to stop future fraudulent payment attempts 
    to the same payee. 
     
    The structure of the FraudEventPayment class is as follows: 
     

       +--------------------------+ 
       |FraudEventPayment       | 
       +--------------------------+

      5.1.1. PayeeName 
     
    Zero or one value of STRING.  The name of the payee. 
    
 
      5.1.2. PostalAddress
     
    Zero or one instance of type POSTAL. A postal address is 
    represented by the POSTAL data type.  This data type is a string 
    whose format is documented in Sections 2.23 of [RFC 4519]. It 
    defines a postal address as a free-form multi-line string separated 
    by the "$" character.

   The POSTAL data type is implemented as an "xs:string" in the schema.
   
 
      5.1.3. PayeeAmount 
  
    Zero or one instances of type AmountType. 
  


    5.2. The FraudEventTransfer class 
     
    The FraudEventTransfer class is used to report the payee 
    instructions for a fraudulent funds transfer or fraudulent funds 
    transfer attempt. Fraudsters sometimes use the same payee 
    instructions (including the amount) for multiple fraudulent funds 
    transfer attempts. By reporting the funds transfer instructions 
    used in the fraud, other institutions may be able to stop future 
    fraudulent funds transfer attempts to the same payee.

    The components of the FraudEventTransfer class are described below.
    At least one component must be present. 
     
      5.2.1. BankID 
     
    Zero or one value of STRING.  The destination bank routing transit 
    ID or other Financial Institution (FI) id. 
     
      5.2.2. AccountID 
     
    Zero or one value of STRING.  The destination primary account 
    number. 
     
      5.2.3. AccountType 
     
    Zero or one instance of type AccountTypeType. 
     
      5.2.4. TransferAmount 
     
    Zero or one instance of type AmountType. 
     
    5.3. The FraudEventIdentity class 
     
    The FraudEventIdentity class is used to report a fraudulent 
    impersonation or fraudulent impersonation attempt.  By reporting 
    the impersonation event, other potential victims may be able to 
    detect future fraudulent impersonation attempts. 
     
       +-------------------------+

    The components of the FraudEventIdentity class are described below.
    At least one component must be present. 
     
      5.3.1. IdentityComponent 
     
    Zero to many instances of type iodef:ExtensionType. This 
    specification defines two extensions: EmailAddress and UserID. 
     
      5.3.2. EmailAddress

    In reporting an identity fraud event, the reporting institution MAY 
    include the victim's email address. This SHALL be achieved by 
    adding an element of type iodef:ExtensionType in the 
    IdentityComponent element. The data type of the extension contents 
    SHALL be xs:string. It SHALL contain the email address of the 
    intended fraud victim. 
     
    The IdentityComponent@type attribute SHALL be set to the value 
    "string". 
     
    The IdentityComponent@meaning attribute SHALL be set to the value 
    "victim email address". 
     
      5.3.3. UserID 
     
    In reporting an identity fraud event, the reporting institution MAY 
    include the victim's user id. This SHALL be achieved by adding an 
    element of type iodef:ExtensionType in the IdentityComponent 
    element. The data type of the extension contents SHALL be 
    xs:string. It SHALL contain the user id of the intended fraud 
    victim. 
     
    The IdentityComponent@type attribute SHALL be set to the value 
    "string". 
     
    The IdentityComponent@meaning attribute SHALL be set to the value 
    "victim user id". 
     
    5.4. The FraudEventOther class 
     
    The FraudEventOther class is used to report fraudulent events other 
    than those detailed above, such as new event types that emerge and 
    become problematic. This class enables such events to be reported, 
    using this same specification and format, even though the specific 
    characteristics of such events have not yet been formally 
    structured and formatted. By reporting the details of these 
    unspecified event types, other institutions may be able to stop 
    future fraudulent activity. 
     
    The structure of the FraudEventOther class is as follows: 
     
       +--------------------------+ 
       |FraudEventOther           | 
       +--------------------------+

    Many of the components of the FraudEventOther class are also 
    components of the FraudEventPayment or FraudEventTransfer class. 
    Their use in the FraudEventOther class is identical. Therefore the 
    descriptions are not duplicated here. The components that are 
    unique to the FraudEventOther class are described below. 
     
      5.4.1. OtherEventType 
     
    One or more values of STRING.  A name that classifies the activity. 
     
     
      5.4.2. OtherEventDescription 
     
    Zero or one values of STRING.  A free form textual description of 
    the activity. 
  
  
    5.5. The PayeeAmount class 
     
    The PayeeAmount class is used to report the amount of the payment 
    fraud, which may be common across a set of related fraud attempts.

    A compliant IODEF fraud report SHALL contain data items as 
    described below: 
     
    Purpose - See Section 7.1. 
     
    IncidentID - As defined by IODEF. 
     
    ReportTime - As defined by IODEF. 
     
    Assessment.Impact - As defined by IODEF. 
     
    Assessment.Confidence - As defined by IODEF. 
     
    Contact.Email - A contact email address for the reporting 
    institution. 
     
    Contact.ContactName - The name of the reporting institution.  In 
    case the reporting institute has consolidated reports from other 
    institutions, elements of this class MAY contain the name of the 
    consolidator, instead of the original reporting institution. 
     
    EventData.DetectTime - The date and time at which the fraud or 
    fraud attempt was detected. This data item is mandatory for 
    specific fraud event reports. However it is optional for fraud 
    event signature reports described in 6.3.  

    EventData.AdditionalData - contains one or more ThraudRecord events.
  
    6.2. Optional contents 
     
    A compliant IODEF fraud report SHOULD contain data items as 
    described below. 
     
    Contact.Contact.ContactName - The name of the reporting fraud 
    analyst. 
     
    Contact.Contact.Email - The email address of the reporting fraud 
    analyst. 
     
    Contact.Contact.Telephone - The telephone number of the reporting 
    fraud analyst. 
     
    EventData.Flow.System.Service.Application - Information about the 
    software used by the attacker, including the type and version of 
    operating system, communication and application software.

    EventData.Flow.System.Node.Location - The name and address of the 
    owner of the DNS domain from which the fraud or fraud attempt was 
    executed. 
     
    EventData.Flow.System.Node.NodeName - As defined by IODEF. 
  
    6.3. Fraud Event Signature Report 
     
    A fraud event signature report conveys information about the 
    behavior associated with fraudulent events, rather than reporting 
    the specific events themselves. An example of a fraud event 
    signature might include a customer performing a wire transfer of 
    over $5,000.00 views email address and wire transfer within a 
    single session, has changed email address within the past 2 weeks 
    and performed at least 2 bill payments to the same payee within a 
    single week. Sharing fraud event signature information enables 
    recipients to detect similar behavior in their own systems. 
     
    A fraud event signature report contains data items as shown below:
     
    Purpose - Includes value "reporting". 
     
    IncidentID - As defined by IODEF. 
     
    ReportTime - As defined by IODEF. 
     
    Assessment.Impact - Includes the severity attribute. 
     
    Method.Reference.ReferenceName - A name for the specific fraud 
    event signature. 
     
    Method.URL - A URL that represents the detailed definition of the 
    fraud event signature.  
     
    Method.Description - A brief description of the behavior covered by 
    the fraud event signature. 
  
    Contact.Email - A contact email address for the reporting 
    institution. 
     
    Contact.ContactName - The name of the reporting institution.

    Add - The identified fraud event SHOULD be added to the corpus by 
    the recipient. 
     
    delete - The identified fraud event SHOULD be deleted from the 
    corpus by the recipient. 
     
    Modify - The identified elements of the fraud event SHOULD be 
    replaced in the corpus by the supplied values. Where no 
    corresponding element exists in the corpus, the element SHOULD be 
    added to the corpus by the recipient. 
     
 8. Security Considerations 
     
    This document focuses on the data format for exchanging transaction 
    fraud data. The critical security concerns are the validity of 
    submitted information (Thraud Reports) and outbound information 
    (Thraud Watchlists) sent upon a query, as well as the protection of 
    contributors privacy when sharing the data. 
     
    8.2. Thraud Data Authenticity and Integrity 
     
    The Thraud Reports SHOULD be digitally signed. This would guarantee 
    the origin and integrity of the submitted information. A possible 
    method is to use the optional IODEF XML signature as defined in 
    [XMLSIG]. The potential recipients of Thraud Reports SHOULD be able 
    to verify these digital signatures. 
     
    8.3. Thraud Data Confidentiality and Privacy  
     
    The Thraud Reports MAY be encrypted when stored for future usage. 
    Contributors of Thraud Reports might not be willing to disclose 
    fraudulent transactions attached to their name. A simple mechanism 
    MUST enable the query of any data to return a valid reponse without 
    disclosing the unique Identifier of a specific organization. 
     
    We suggest to use an opaque identifier for each report in order to 
    index privately the reports. A hash function (e.g. SHA-1) MAY be 
    used to generate the opaque identifier from the organization name:  
     
                OpaqueIdentifier = SHA-1(<IncidentID Field>) 
     
    The OpaqueIdentifier can be used to reference the report without

    8.4. Data Protection During Transit 
     
    In addition to protecting thraud data when stored, the data also 
    needs to be protected during transit. This specification does not

    digitally signed and encrypted during transit. It is recommended 
    that commonly used secure protocols, such as HTTPS, SSL and SOAP 
    over EV SSL be used.

 10.  Conclusion 
     
    This internet draft introduced Transaction Fraud (Thraud) reporting 
    mechanisms to enable the sharing of Fraud data. Based on the IODEF-
    document format, the proposed extension should facilitate 
    interoperability and provide increase security for online 
    applications.
