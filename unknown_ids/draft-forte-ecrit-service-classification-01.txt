Abstract

   This document creates a registry for describing the types of services
   available at a specific location.  The registry is then referenced by
   other protocols that need a common set of service terms as protocol
   constants.  In particular, we define location-based service as either
   a point at a specific geographic location (e.g., bus stop) or a
   service covering a specific region (e.g., pizza delivery).

Internet-Draft           Service Classification            November 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document creates a registry for service tokens.  We anticipate
   that the network, through configuration or management protocols,
   tells a mobile device what kind of location it finds itself in and
   what kind of services are available "close by" that location.  For
   example, given their location, users might want to query the system
   for the closest ATM machine or gas station.

   Naturally, the number of descriptive terms for possible services is
   almost unbounded.  This registry tries to identify common terms that
   are likely to be useful for communications devices.  The terms
   roughly correspond to the level of details of location descriptions
   and icons found on geographic maps, for example, and are meant to be
   in common use across a variety of cultures and countries.

   The use of tokens (i.e., protocol constants) makes it easier to build
   systems across multiple languages.  A user interface can readily
   translate a finite set of tokens to user-appropriate textual or
   iconic representations.  Protocols using this registry are encouraged
   to provide additional mechanisms to accommodate services not
   currently registered via free-text fields with appropriate language
   and character set labeling.

   In many cases, a service might be described by multiple terms that
   apply at the same time.  For example, the combination of "restaurant"
   and "airport" is immediately recognizable.  This registry makes no
   attempt to limit the number of terms that can be used to describe a
   single service or to restrict what combinations are allowed.  Common
   sense is probably a better guide here; the authors would not want to
   rule out creative business models such as combinations of "parking"
   and "restaurant" or "bar" and "hospital".  The number of terms that
   can be used within the same protocol element is left to the protocol
   description.

   This document does not describe how the values of the registry are to
   be used, as this description is provided by other documents.


2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  Schema

   This registry can be used in two ways, first, as a list of tokens, to
   be referenced by appropriate protocols that accept textual tokens,
   and second, as a schema, with its own namespace, referenced by other
   schema, either explicitly or via namespace="##other".

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Registering tokens

   This document creates new IANA registries for location-based services
   as listed in Section 3, starting with
   'urn:service:business.convention-center' and finishing with
   'urn:service:travel.motel'.

   IANA will maintain this registry both in the form of an XML schema
   and a list of tokens, with the same content.

Internet-Draft           Service Classification            November 2008


   Following the policies outline in [RFC2434], new tokens are assigned
   after Expert Review.  The Expert Reviewer will generally consult the
   IETF GeoPRIV working group mailing list or its designated successor.
   Updates or deletions of tokens from the registration follow the same
   procedures.

   The expert review should be guided by a few common sense
   considerations.  For example, tokens should be well- defined and
   widely recognized.  The expert's support of IANA will include
   providing IANA with the new token(s) when the update is provided only
   in the form of a schema, and providing IANA with the new schema
   element(s) when the update is provided only in the form of a token.

   Each registration must include the name of the token.  For the most
   appropriate terminology in defining token names for new services, the
   official UN classification [ISICrev3] must be consulted first.  If no
   entry is present for the new service in the UN classification, then a
   new term can be defined.

   To ensure widespread usability across protocols, tokens MUST follow
   the character set restrictions for XML Names [XML].

5.2.  URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:location-service

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:location-service

   Description: This is the XML namespace for XML elements defined by
   this draft to describe location services within XML documents.

6.  Internationalization Considerations

   The service values listed in this document MUST NOT be presented to

   the user.  The values therefore have the characteristic of tokens or
   tags and no internationalization support is required.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a registry for location-based services and as
   such does not raise security issues.
