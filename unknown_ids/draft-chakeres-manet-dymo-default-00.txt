Internet-Draft                    DYMO                        April 2008


1.  Overview

   This document describes how to distribute, create, and update a
   default route in DYMO [I-D.ietf-manet-dymo].

   A default route can be very effective in reducing the number of route
   discoveries, particularly for destinations not reachable inside a
   MANET.

   The mechanisms proposed in this document reuse DYMO's existing RM
   processing and forwarding logic.  Similarly, this specification
   ensures that DYMO remains reactive for known locally reachable
   destinations.


2.  Applicability Statement

   This specification allows one DYMO router within a MANET, called a
   DYMO Default Router (DDR), to advertise a default route (DROUTE).

   In the simplest operational mode, we assume that all DYMO routers in
   the MANET know the locally reachable destination addresses.
   Reversing this logic, we assume that all DYMO routers know which
   destination addresses are not locally reachable, and that should be
   forwarded via the DDR.  Correspondingly, the set of reachable/
   unreachable destinations is known by all DYMO routers in the MANET.

   In a more complex mode of operation, we describe how the DDR can
   inform other DYMO routers that a particular address or set of
   addresses is directly reachable in the MANET (Section 8).  Note that,
   the DDR may or may not know all the reachable destination addresses.


3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Default Route (DROUTE)
      A default route is represented by 0.0.0.0 or ::/0 [RFC5156].

   REACHABLE_ADDRESSES
      The list of addresses known/assumed to be reachable with the
      MANET.  Route discoveries are performed for these destinations.

Internet-Draft                    DYMO                        April 2008


   REACHABLE_ADDRESS_TIMEOUT
      The amount of time to wait before removing a dynamically added
      REACHABLE_ADDRESS entry.


4.  Distributing and Installing a Default Route

   The DDR MAY reactively or proactively distribute DROUTE information.

   The DDR may advertise a default route by attaching the DROUTE address
   to a RM (RREQ or RREP) as described in DYMO Section 5.3.5 "Adding
   Additional Routing Information to a RM".  The prefix length is set to
   zero (0).

   Alternatively, the DDR may advertise a default route by inserting the
   DROUTE address as the OrigNode and TargetNode in a RREQ.  The prefix
   length is set to zero (0).

   DYMO routers conforming to this specification process the DDR routing
   information as if it were a unicast address.


5.  Performing Route Discovery in the Presence of a Default Route

   If a default route exists, DYMO routers MUST still perform route
   discovery for those destination addresses reachable within the MANET.
   Each DYMO router SHOULD maintain this list of addresses, and their
   prefixes.  We will refer to this list as REACHABLE_ADDRESSES.


6.  Forwarding Data Packets

   When a DYMO router receives a data packet for forwarding with a
   destination addresses not reachable within the MANET, the default
   route SHOULD be used for forwarding.


7.  DYMO Default Router Learning about  Locally Reachable Destinations

   The DDR MAY learn about locally reachable destinations, by examining
   the source address in data packets it receives from the MANET for
   forwarding.  These sources SHOULD be added to the DDR's
   REACHABLE_ADDRESSES.  These entries SHOULD be removed after
   REACHABLE_ADDRESS_TIMEOUT seconds.

8.  Informing DYMO Routers about Locally  Reachable Destinations

   When the DDR receives a data packet for a locally reachable
   destination, it SHOULD inform the source's DYMO router that this
   particular destination exists in the local MANET by issuing a
   Destination Reachable DYMO control message.

   The Destination Reachable (DR) DYMO control message is unicast hop-
   by-hop to the DYMO router responsible for the source of the data
   packet.  Note: the exact format of this message will be flushed out
   in later drafts.

   DYMO routers processing this DR message SHOULD add the reachable
   destination(s) to their REACHABLE_DESTINATIONS list.  These entries
   SHOULD be removed after REACHABLE_ADDRESS_TIMEOUT seconds.


9.  Backward Compatibility

   The DYMO specification [I-D.ietf-manet-dymo] defines unicast routing
   for valid unicast IP destination addresses.  Therefore, if a DYMO
   router does not follow the directions describe in this document, it
   will not process or forward DROUTE routing information.


10.  Security Considerations

   TBD


11.  Acknowledgments

   DYMO is a descendant of the design of previous MANET reactive
   protocols, especially AODV [RFC3561].  Some of the concepts contained
   in the document come from AODV, AODV-bis, and early DYMO I-Ds.
