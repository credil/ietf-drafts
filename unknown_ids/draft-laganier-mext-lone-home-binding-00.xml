	RFC5648 extends MIPv6 with the ability for a Mobile Node to register
	Multiple Care-of Addresses with its Home Agent and Correspondent
	Node(s).  RFC 5648 also introduces the notion of a Home Binding that is
	essentially a binding on the Home Link, where the Care-of Address is
	set to the Home Address of the Mobile Node. A Mobile Node uses such a
	Home Binding together with one or more Multiple Care-of Address
	binding(s) to be able to use simultaneously both the Home Link and one
	or more visited link(s). The description of the Home Binding in a
	section of RFC 5846 entitled "Returning Home: Simultaneous Home and
	Visited Link Operation" seems to imply that a Home Binding can only be
	legitimately created while returning home and maintaining simultaneous
	bindings on one or more visited link(s).  There is however no specific
	reason to prevent creation of such a Home Binding when the Mobile Node
	is only attached to the Home Link and does not have any interface
	attached to a visited link.  Moreover, there is a specific use case for
	the creation of such a Lone Home Binding.  This specification explicits
	the use case for creation of a Lone Home Binding, and clarifies the
	protocol behavior of Mobile IPv6 nodes (Mobile Node, Home Agent,
	Correspondent Node) involved with its creation.

<section title="Introduction">

   <t>
		

	Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) <xref target="RFC3775"/> specifies a protocol which
	allows nodes to remain reachable while moving to different location of
	the IPv6 Internet, and of the IPv4 Internet when extended with Dual
	Stack support <xref target="RFC5555"/>.  Each mobile node is identified
	by a so-called Home Address that is independent from its current point
	of attachment.  A mobile node also has a so-called Care-of Address at
	which it is reachable and which reflects its current point of
	attachment. MIPv6 allows a mobile node to register with its Home Agent
	and correspondent nodes the binding between its Home Address and
	Care-of Address so that they are able to route appropriately packet
	they wish to send to its Home Address.

   </t>

   <t>

	<xref target="RFC5648"/> extends MIPv6 with the ability for a Mobile
	Node to register Multiple Care-of Addresses with its Home Agent and
	Correspondent Node(s).  RFC 5648 also introduces the notion of a Home
	Binding that is essentially a binding on the Home Link, where the
	Care-of Address is set to the Home Address of the Mobile Node. A Mobile
	Node uses such a Home Binding together with one or more Multiple
	Care-of Address binding(s) to be able to use simultaneously both the
	Home Link and one or more visited link(s). 

</t>
<t> 

	The Home Binding is described in a subsection of Section 5.6 of <xref
		target="RFC5648"/> entitled "Returning Home: Simultaneous Home
	and Visited Link Operation", which seems to imply that a Home Binding
	can only be legitimately created while returning home and maintaining
	simultaneous bindings on one or more visited link(s).  There is however
	no specific reason to prevent creation of such a Home Binding when the
	Mobile Node is only attached to the Home Link and does not have any
	interface attached to a visited link.  Moreover, there is a specific
	use case for the creation of such a Lone Home Binding.

</t>

<t> 
	This specification explicits the use case for creation of a Lone Home
	Binding, and clarifies the protocol behavior of Mobile IPv6 nodes
	(Mobile Node, Home Agent, Correspondent Node) involved with its
	creation.

		The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL

<section title="Terminology">

	<t>
           
	   Lone Home Binding: A Home Binding as per <xref target="RFC5648"/>,
	   i.e., where the Care-of Address for the binding is set to the Home
	   Address of the Mobile Node, where there exists no other bindings to
	   Care-of Addresses configured by the Mobile Node on one or more
	   visited link(s).

	</t>

	<t>

	Other terms used throughout this document are defined in the documents
	specifying the Mobile IPv6 protocol suite: <xref target="RFC3775"/>,
	<xref target="RFC5555"/>, <xref target="RFC5648"/>, and <xref
		target="I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding"/>.

	</t>

</section>

<section title="Usage Scenario">

	<t>

	 <xref target="RFC3775"/> specifies that a node receiving a Mobility
	 Header "MUST ignore and skip any options which it does not
	 understand." This makes it possible for a Mobile Node supporting and
	 using new option(s) and sending messages to a Home Agent or a
	 Correspond Node that does not support them to detect that fact and
	 respond accordingly. As such, inclusion of the options defined in
	 these extension in a Binding Update constitute an implicit capability
	 detection for a Home Agent or a Correspondent Node. Absence of the
	 options in a Binding Acknowledgment with a Status code indicating
	 success indicates that the Home Agent or Correspondent Node does not
	 support the extension making use of the option. 

 </t>
 <t>

	 Following that, two extensions to the basic MIPv6 protocol that
	 introduces new Mobility Options require that a conformant node
	 receiving a Binding Update including such an option includes a copy of
	 that option in the Binding Acknowledgment confirming successful
	 creation of a binding:  

 <list style="symbols">
 <t> 

	 <xref target="RFC5648"/> states that "Whenever a Binding
	 Acknowledgement is sent, all the Binding Identifier mobility options
	 stored in the Binding Update MUST be copied to the Binding
	 Acknowledgement except the Status field." 
 
 </t>

 <t>

	<xref target="I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding"/> states that "a mobile node
	receiving a Binding Acknowledgement in response to the transmission of
	a Binding Update MUST determine if the Binding Acknowledgement contains
	a copy of every flow identification mobility options included in the
	Binding Update.  A Binding Acknowledgement without flow identification
	option(s), in response to a Binding Update with flow identification
	mobility option, would indicate inability (or unwillingness) on behalf
	of the source node to support the extensions presented in this
	document."

	 </t>
</list>

 </t>


	<t>

	While this mechanism seems to be sufficient for capability detection,
	if a Mobile Node cannot create a Lone Home Binding the capability
	detection will incur side effects that are undesirable when the Home
	Agent or Correspondent node does not support the extensions specified
	in  <xref target="RFC5648"/> and <xref
		target="I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding"/>. Suppose that a Mobile
	Node implementing these extensions wants to use the Home Link to send
	traffic in the case of <xref target="RFC5648"/>, or to send and receive
	traffic in the case of  <xref target="I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding"/>.
	Suppose further that the Mobile Node does not know yet that the Home
	Agent it has chosen, or the Correspondent Nodes it would like to
	creating binding do not support said extensions. In such a situation
	the Mobile Node has to perform capability detection by sending to the
	Home Agent or the Correspondent Node a Binding Update including a FID
	option <xref target="I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding"/> and/or a BID option
	<xref target="RFC5648"/> depending on the capability to be detected.

</t>

<t>

	If the Mobile Node is not allowed to create a Lone Home Binding, it
	will send this Binding Update from a Care-of Address on a visited link.
	The receiver will ignore the BID and FID options it does not
	understand, and as a result will create a single binding towards the
	Care-of Address. This will disrupt the Mobile Node transmission and/or
	reception of traffic on the Home Link.

</t>

<t>

	Were the Mobile Node allowed to create a Lone Home Binding, it could
	perform capability detection by creating a Lone Home Binding, which
	would not disrupt the Mobile Node Transmission and/or reception of
	traffic at the Home Link. Therefore, this document specifies how to
	create a Lone Home Binding.

<section title="Mobile Node Operation">

	<t>

		A Mobile Node MAY create a Lone Home Binding while not having
		any other binding on visited links in the same fashion that it
		would create a Home Binding while maintaining simultaneous
		attachment to one or more visited link(s), as specified in
		Section 5.2.5 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding"/>
		and/or Section 5.6.3 of <xref target="RFC5648"/>.

	</t>

</section>

<section title="Home Agent and Correspondent Node Operation">

	<t>

		A Home Agent or a Correspondent Node that supports <xref
			target="I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding"/> and/or <xref
			target="RFC5648"/> MUST be prepared to receive a
		Binding Update from a Mobile Node requesting creation of a Lone
		Home Binding while no other binding exists towards Care-of
		Address(es) configured by the Mobile Node on visited links.
		
	</t>
	<t>

		Such a Home Agent or Correspondent Node MUST process a Binding
		Update requesting the creation of a Lone Home Binding in the
		same fashion that it would process a Binding Update requesting
		creation of a Home Binding while maintaining simultaneous
		attachment to one or more visited link(s), as specified in
		Section 5.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding"/>
		and/or Section 6.3 of <xref target="RFC5648"/>.

	<section title="IANA Considerations">

	<t>

			There are no IANA considerations for this specification.

<section title="Security Considerations">

	<t>

		The security considerations of  <xref target="RFC5648"/> and

<section title="Acknowledgment">

	<t>

		The authors would like to thanks Patrick Stupar for interesting discussion regarding the Lone Home Binding. 
		Creation of a Lone Home Binding was first proposed in <xref target="I-D.devarapalli-mext-mipv6-home-link"/>.
