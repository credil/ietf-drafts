                     SEND Name Type field Registry
               draft-ietf-csi-send-name-type-registry-00

Abstract

   SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) defines the Name Type field in the
   Trust Anchor option.  This document requesto to IANA the creation and
   management of a registry for this field.  This document also
   specifies a new Name Type field based on a certificate Subject Key
   Identifier (SKI).

2.  Introduction

   SEcure Neighbor Discovery [RFC3971] (SEND) utilizes X.509v3
   certificates that include [RFC3779] extension for IPv6 addresses to
   certify a router authority over an IPv6 prefix for NDP (Neighbor
   Discovery Protocol).  The Trust Anchor Option in section 6.4.3 of RFC
   3971 allows the identification of the Trust Anchor (TA) selected by
   the host.  In that section, two name types were defined, the DER
   Encoded X.501 Name and a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).  This
   document requesto to IANA the creation and management of a registry
   for this field.

   In any Public Key Infrastructure, the subject name of a certificate
   is only unique within each CA.  A new option to identify TAs across
   CAs is needed.

   In [I-D.ietf-csi-send-cert] the certificate profile described in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs] is adopted for SEND.  In these documents,
   the Subject field the certificates are declared to be meaningless and
   the subjectAltName field is not allowed.  On the other hand, the
   Subject Key Identifier (SKI) extension for the X.509 certificates is
   defined as mandatory and non-critical.

   This document specifies a new Name Type field in the SEND TA option
   that allows to use of the SKI X.509 extension to identify TA X.509
   certificates.

3.  SEND SKI trust anchor Name Type field.

   Name Type

   3 SHA-1 Subject Key Identifier (SKI)

   The Key Identifier used here is the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the value
   of the DER-encoded ASN.1 bit string of the subject public key, as
   described in Section 4.2.1.2 of [RFC5280].

3.1.  Processing Rules for Router

   As described in RFC 3971, a TA is identified by the SEND TA option.
   If the TA option is represented as a SHA-1 SKI, then the SKI must be
   equal to the SKI in the anchor's certificate calculated as described
   in [draft-ietf-sidr-res-certs-17].  The router SHOULD include the TA
   option(s) in the advertisement for which the certification path was
   found.

   If the router is unable to find a path to the requested anchor, it
   SHOULD send an advertisement without any certificate.  In this case,
   the router SHOULD include the TA options that were solicited.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will maintains the registry of Name Type field in the ICMP Trust
   Anchor option.  The registry records Name Type fields for the ICMP
   Trust Anchor option (15) defined in the RFC 3971.

   The following Name Type fields are defined:

   1 DER Encoded X.501 Name (RFC 3971).

   2 FQDN (RFC 3971)

   3 SHA-1 Subject Key Identifier (SKI) (Section 3)

   New assignments of Name Type field is through Standards Action.
