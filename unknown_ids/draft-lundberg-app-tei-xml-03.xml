    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the 'application/tei+xml' media type for markup

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>The TEI is an international and interdisciplinary standard that is
      widely used by libraries, museums, publishers, and individual scholars
      to represent all kinds of textual material for online research and
      teaching. <xref target="TEI"/></t>

      <t>In order to increase the possibilities for generic XML processing of
      TEI documents on the Internet this document defines the
      'application/tei+xml' media type in accordance with <xref
      target="RFC3023"/>.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="registration"
	     title="Registration of MIME type &apos;application/tei+xml&apos;">
      <t>
	<list>
	  <t>MIME media type name:  application</t>
	  <t>MIME subtype name:  tei+xml</t>
	  <t>Required parameters:  None</t>
	  <t>
	    Optional parameters:  charset
	    <list>
	      <t>Identical with charset in <xref target="RFC3023"/></t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    Encoding considerations:
	    <list>
	      <t>By virtue of TEI XML content being XML, it has the same
	      considerations when sent as 'application/tei+xml' as does XML in
	      general. See RFC 3023 <xref target="RFC3023"/>, Section
	      3.2.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    Security considerations:
	    <list>
	      <t>TEI elements may refer to arbitrary URIs.  Hence the security
	      issues of <xref target="RFC3986"/>, section 7, apply. See also
	      <xref target="security">Security considerations</xref></t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    Interoperability considerations:
	    <list>
	      <t>TEI documents often have the extension '.xml', which is not
	      uncommon for other XML document formats.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    Published specification:
	    <list>
	      <t>This media type registration is for TEI documents as
	      described in the TEI Guidelines<xref target="TEI"/>.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>
	    Applications which use this media type:
	    <list>
	      <t>There are currently no applications using the media type
	      'application/tei+xml'.  It will be an entirely new type which is
	      registered in order to allow for the deployment of TEI on
	      the World Wide Web as a first class XML application.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    Additional information:

	    <list>
	      <t>
		Magic number(s):
		<list>
		  <t>There is no single initial octet sequence that is always
		  present in TEI documents.</t>
		</list>
	      </t>
	      <t>
		file extension(s):
		<list>
		  <t>Common extensions are '.tei', '.teiCorpus' and '.odd'.</t>

	      </t>
	      <t>
		Macintosh File Type Code(s)

    <section title="Recognizing TEI files">

      <t>TEI files are XML documents or fragments having the root element in a
      TEI namespace, i.e., a namespace URI starting with
      http://www.tei-c.org/ns/ followed by the version number of the
      namespace. The current namespace is <eref
      target="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0</eref></t>

      <t>In general, a <xref target="TEI"/> file usually contains either of
      the strings
      <list>
	<t>&lt;TEI</t>
	<t>&lt;teiCorpus</t> 
      </list>

      near the beginning, and usually after an
      XML declaration on the first line, i.e., a string like "&lt;?xml
      ... ?&gt;".</t>

      <t>
	Examples:

	<list>

	  <t>Frequently, the actual XML content of TEI files will contain
	  &lt;TEI somewhere early on.</t>

	  <t>More specialized types of documents
	  may start with a lower case tei as in &lt;teiCorpus.</t>

	</list>
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Fragment identifier">
      <t>Documents having the media type 'application/tei+xml', use the
	fragment identifier notation in the way specified in <xref
	target="RFC3023"/> for the media type 'application/xml'.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security considerations">

      <t>An XML resource does not in itself compromise data security. When
      being available on a network simply through the dereferencing of an IRI
      <xref target="RFC3987"/> or a URI, care must be taken to properly
      interpret the data to prevent unintended access.</t>

      <section title="Harmful content">
	<t>Any application accepting submitted or retrieving TEI XML for
	processing has to be aware of risks connected with injection of
	harmful scripts and executable XML. Even common XML inclusion or the
	use of external entities, could potentially be used to reveal aspects
	of a service that may compromise its security. Any vulnerability of
	these kinds are, however, application specific. The TEI namespaces do
	not contain such elements.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Intellectual Property Rights">
	<t>TEI documents often arise in digitization of cultural heritage
	materials. Texts made accessible in TEI format may be free in the
	sense that there are no restrictions to their distribution through
	Digital Rights Management<xref target="DRM"/> or Intellectual Property
	Rights<xref target="IPR"/> constraints. TEI documents are
	heterogeneous objects. Some parts of a document may be free, whereas
	other parts, such as editorial text and annotations may be written
	much later may hence be subject to DRM restrictions.</t>

	<t>The TEI format provides means for highly granular attribution, down
	to the content of individual XML elements. Software agents
	participating in the exchange or processing TEI must honour markup of
	this kind. Even when there are no IPR constraints, intellectual
	honesty alone requires that document users are able to tell the
	difference between content from different sources.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Authenticity and confidentiality">
	<t>Historical archival records are often encoded in TEI and legal
	document may be binding centuries after they were
	written. Digitization and encoding of legal texts may require
	technologies for assuring authenticity, such as cryptographic
	check sums and electronic signatures.</t>

	<t>Similarly, historical documents may in part their entirety be
	confidential. This may be required by law or by the terms and
	conditions of a donation. A text archive need content filtering or
	cryptographic technologies to meet such requirements.</t>
