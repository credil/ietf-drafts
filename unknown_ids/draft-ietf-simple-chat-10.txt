    Multi-party Chat Using the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
                       draft-ietf-simple-chat-10

Abstract

   The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) defines a mechanism for
   sending instant messages within a peer-to-peer session, negotiated
   using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP).  This document defines the necessary
   tools for establishing multi-party chat sessions, or chat rooms,
   using MSRP.

Internet-Draft            Multi-party Chat MSRP           September 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) [RFC4975] defines a
   mechanism for sending a series of instant messages within a session.
   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] in combination with
   the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC3264] allows for two peers
   to establish and manage such sessions.

   In another application of SIP, a user agent can join in a multi-party
   conversation called a conference that is hosted by a specialized user
   agent called a focus [RFC4353].  Such a conference can naturally
   involve MSRP sessions.  It is the responsibility of an entity
   handling the media to relay instant messages received from one
   participant to the rest of the participants in the conference.

   Several such systems already exist in the Internet.  Participants in
   a chat room can be identified with a pseudonym or nickname, and
   decide whether their real identity is disclosed to other
   participants.  Participants can also use a rich set of features such
   as the ability to send private instant messages to other
   participants.

   Similar conferences supporting chat rooms are already available
   today.  For example, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) [RFC2810], Extensible
   Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core [RFC6120] based chat
   rooms, and many other proprietary systems provide chat room
   functionality.  Specifying equivalent functionality for MSRP-based
   systems provides competitive features and enables interworking
   between the systems.

   This document defines requirements, conventions, and extensions for
   providing private messages and nickname management in centralized
   conferences with MSRP.  Participants in a chat room can be identified
   by a pseudonym, and decide if their real identity is disclosed to
   other participants.  This memo uses the SIP Conferencing Framework
   [RFC4353] as a design basis.  It also aims to be compatible with the
   A Framework for Centralized Conferencing [RFC5239].  It is expected
   that future mechanisms will be developed for providing similar
   functionality in generic conferences, i.e., where the media is not
   only restricted to MSRP.  The mechanisms described in this document
   provide a future compatible short-term solution for MSRP centralized
   conferences.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, BCP 14
   [RFC2119], and indicate requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

   This memo deals with tightly coupled SIP conferences defined in SIP
   Conferencing Framework [RFC4353] and adopts the terminology from that
   document.  In addition to that terminology, we introduce some new
   terms:

   Nickname:   a pseudonym or descriptive name associated to a
      participant.  See Section 7 for details

   Multi-party chat:   an instance of a tightly coupled conference, in
      which the media exchanged between the participants consist of MSRP
      based instant messages.  Also known as a chat room.

   Chat Room:   a synonym for a multi-party chat.

   Chat Room URI:   a URI that identifies a particular chat room, and is
      a synonym of a Conference URI defined in RFC 4353 [RFC4353].

   Sender:   the conference participant that originally created an
      instant message and sent it to the chat room for delivery.

   Recipient:   the destination conference participant(s).  This
      defaults to the full conference participant list, minus the IM
      Sender.

   MSRP switch:   a media level entity that is a MSRP endpoint.  It is a
      special MSRP endpoint that receives MSRP messages, and delivers
      them to the other conference participants.  The MSRP switch has a
      similar role to a conference mixer with the exception that the
      MSRP switch does not actually "mix" together different input media
      streams; it merely relays the messages between participants.

   Private Instant Message:   an instant message sent in a chat room
      intended for a single participant.  A private IM is usually
      rendered distinctly from the rest of the IMs, indicating that the
      message was a private communication.

   Anonymous URI:  a URI concealing the participant's SIP AOR from the
      other participants in the conference.  The allocation of such a
      URI is out of scope of this specification.  An anonymous URI must
      be valid for the length of the conference, and will be utilized by
      the MSRP switch to forward messages to and from anonymous
      participants.

   Conference Event Package:  a notification mechanism that allow
      conference participants to learn conference information including
      roster and state changes in a conference.  This would typically be
      A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Conference
      State [RFC4575] or Conference Event Package Data Format Extension
      for Centralized Conferencing [I-D.ietf-xcon-event-package].


3.  Motivations and Requirements

   Although conference frameworks describing many types of conferencing
   applications already exist, such as the Framework for Centralized
   Conferencing [RFC5239] and the SIP Conferencing Framework [RFC4353],
   the exact details of session-based instant messaging conferences are
   not well-defined at the moment.

   To allow interoperable chat implementations, for both conference-
   aware, and conference-unaware user agents, certain conventions for
   MSRP conferences need to be defined.  It also seems beneficial to
   provide a set of features that enhance the baseline multi-party MSRP
   in order to be able to create systems that have functionality on par
   with existing chat systems, as well as enable building interworking
   gateways to these existing chat systems.

   We define the following requirements:

   REQ-1:  A basic requirement is the existence of a multi-party
           conference, where participants can join and leave the
           conference and get instant messages exchanged to the rest of
           the participants.

   REQ-2:  A conference participant must be able to determine the
           identities of the sender and recipient of the received IMs.

   REQ-3:  A conference participant must be able to determine the
           recipient of the received message.  For instance, the
           recipient of the message might be the entire conference or a
           single participant of the conference (i.e., a private
           message).

   REQ-4:  It must be possible to send a message to a single participant
           within the conference (i.e., a private instant message).

   REQ-5:  A conference participant may have a nickname or pseudonym
           associated with their real identity.

Internet-Draft            Multi-party Chat MSRP           September 2011


   REQ-6:  It must be possible for a participant to change their
           nickname during the progress of the conference.

   REQ-7:  It must be possible that a participant is only known by an
           anonymous identity and not their real identity to the rest of
           the conference.

   REQ-8:  It must be possible for the conference participants to learn
           the chat room capabilities described in this document.


4.  Overview of Operation

   In order to set up a conference, one must first be created.  Users
   wishing to host a conference themselves can of course do just that;
   their User Agent (UA) simply morphs from an ordinary UA into a
   special purpose one called a Focus UA.  Another, commonly used setup
   is one where a dedicated node in the network functions as a Focus UA.

   Each chat room has an identity of its own: a SIP URI that
   participants use to join the conference, e.g. by sending an INVITE
   request.  The conference focus processes the invitations, and as
   such, maintains SIP dialogs with each participant.  In a multi-party
   chat, or chat room, MSRP is one of the established media streams.
   Each conference participant establishes an MSRP session with the MSRP
   switch, which is a special purpose MSRP application.  The MSRP
   sessions can be relayed by one or more MSRP relays, which are
   specified in RFC 4976 [RFC4976].  This is illustrated in Figure 1

   The MSRP switch is similar to a conference mixer in that it handles
   media sessions with each of the participants and bridges these
   streams together.  However, unlike a conference mixer, the MSRP
   switch merely forwards messages between participants but doesn't
   actually mix the streams in any way.  The system is illustrated in
   Figure 2.

          Figure 2: Multi-party chat in a Centralized Conference

   Typically conference participants also subscribe to a conference
   event package to gather information about the conference roster in
   the form of conference state notifications.  For example,
   participants can learn about other participants' identities,
   including their nicknames.

   All messages in the chat room use the 'Message/CPIM' wrapper content
   type [RFC3862], so that it is possible to distinguish between private
   and regular messages.  When a participant wants to send an instant
   message to the conference, it constructs an MSRP SEND request and
   submits it to the MSRP switch including a regular payload (e.g. a
   Message/CPIM message that contains a text, HTML, an image, etc.).
   The Message/CPIM To header is set to the chat room URI.  The switch
   then fans out the SEND request to all of the other participants using
   their existing MSRP sessions.

   A participant can also send a private instant message addressed to a
   participant whose identity has been learned, e.g. via a conference
   event package.  In this case the sender creates an MSRP SEND request
   with a Message/CPIM body whose To header contains not the chat room
   URI but the recipient's URI.  The MSRP switch then forwards the SEND
   request to that recipient.  This specification supports the sending
   of private messages to one and only one recipient.  However, if the

   recipient is logged from different endpoints, the MSRP switch will
   distribute the private message to each endpoint the recipient is
   logged.

   We extend the current MSRP negotiation that takes place in SDP
   [RFC4566] to allow participants to learn whether the chat room
   supports and is willing to accept (e.g. due to local policy
   restrictions) certain MSRP functions defined in this memo, such as
   nicknames or private messaging.

   Naturally, when a participant wishes to leave a chat room, it sends a
   SIP BYE request to the Focus UA and terminates the SIP dialog with
   the focus and MSRP sessions with the MSRP switch.

   This document assumes that each chat room is allocated its own SIP
   URI.  A user joining a chat room sends an INVITE request to that SIP
   URI, and as a result, a new MSRP session is established between the
   user and the MSRP switch.  It is assumed that an MSRP session is
   mapped to a chat room.  If a user wants to join a second chat room,
   he creates a different INVITE request, through a different SIP
   dialog, which leads to the creation of a second MSRP session between
   the user and the MSRP switch.  Notice that these two MSRP sessions
   can still be multiplexed over the same TCP connection as per regular
   MSRP procedures.  However, each chat room is associated to a unique
   MSRP session and a unique SIP dialog.


5.  Creating, Joining, and Deleting a Chat Room

5.1.  Creating a Chat Room

   Since we consider a chat room a particular type of conference having
   MSRP media, the methods defined by the SIP Conference Framework
   [RFC4353] for creating conferences are directly applicable to a chat
   room.

   Once a chat room is created, it is identified by a SIP URI, like any
   other conference.

5.2.  Joining a Chat Room

   Participants usually join the conference by sending an INVITE request
   to the conference URI.  As long as the conference policy allows, the
   INVITE request is accepted by the focus and the user is brought into
   the conference.

   The MSRP switch needs to be aware of the URIs of the participant
   (SIP, Tel, or IM URIs) in order to validate messages sent from this



Niemi, et al.            Expires March 23, 2012                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft            Multi-party Chat MSRP           September 2011


   participant prior to their forwarding.  This information is known to
   the focus of the conference.  Therefore an interface between the
   focus and the MSRP switch is assumed.  However, the interface between
   the focus and the MSRP switch is outside the scope of this document.

   Conference aware participants will detect that the peer is a focus
   due to the presence of the "isfocus" feature tag [RFC3840] in the
   Contact header field of the 200-class response to the INVITE request.
   Conference unaware participants will not notice it is a focus, and
   can not apply the additional mechanisms defined in this document.
   Participants are also aware that the mixer is an MSRP switch due to
   the presence of a 'message' media type and either TCP/MSRP or TCP/
   TLS/MSRP as the protocol field in the media line of SDP [RFC4566].

   The conference focus of a chat room MUST include support for a
   Message/CPIM [RFC3862] top-level wrapper for the MSRP messages by
   setting the 'accept-types' MSRP media line attribute in the SDP offer
   or answer to include 'Message/CPIM'.

      Note that the 'Message/CPIM' wrapper is used to carry the sender
      information that, otherwise, it will not be available to the
      recipient.  Additionally, 'Message/CPIM' wrapper carries the
      recipient information (e.g.  To and Cc: headers).

   If a participant wants to remain anonymous to the rest of the
   participants in the conference, the participant's UA must provide an
   anonymous URI to the conference focus.  The URI will be used in the
   From and To headers in the 'Message/CPIM' wrapper, and can be learned
   by the other participants of the conference.  Notice that in order
   for the anonymity mechanism to work, the anonymous URI must not
   reveal the participant's SIP AOR.  The mechanism for acquiring an
   anonymous URI is outside the scope of this specification.

   The conference focus of a chat room MUST learn the chat room
   capabilities of each participant that joins the chat room.  The
   conference focus MUST inform the MSRP switch of such support in order
   to prevent the MSRP switch from distributing private messages to
   participants who do not support private messaging.  The recipient
   would not be able to render the message as private, and any potential
   reply would be sent to the whole chat room.

5.3.  Deleting a Chat Room

   As with creating a conference, the methods defined by the SIP
   Conference Framework [RFC4353] for deleting a conference are directly
   applicable to a chat room.  The MSRP switch will terminate the MSRP
   sessions with all the participants.

Internet-Draft            Multi-party Chat MSRP           September 2011


   Deleting a chat room is an action that heavily depends on the policy
   of the chat room.  The policy can determine that the chat room is
   deleted when the creator leaves the conference, or with any out of
   band mechanism.


6.  Sending and Receiving Instant Messages

6.1.  Regular Messages

   This section describes the conventions used to send and receive
   instant messages that are addressed to all the participants in the
   chat room.  These are sent over a regular MSRP SEND request that
   contains a Message/CPIM wrapper [RFC3862] that in turn contains the
   desired payload (e.g. text, image, video-clip, etc.).

   When a chat room participant wishes to send an instant message to all
   the other participants in the chat room, it constructs an MSRP SEND
   request according to the procedures specified in RFC 4975 [RFC4975].
   The sender MAY choose the desired MSRP report model (e.g., populate
   the Success-Report and Failure-Report MSRP header fields).

   The SEND request MUST contain a top-level wrapper of type 'Message/
   CPIM' according to RFC 3862 [RFC3862].  The actual instant message
   payload MUST be included as payload of the 'Message/CPIM' wrapper and
   MAY be of any type negotiated in the SDP 'accept-types' attribute
   according to the MSRP rules.

   On sending a regular message the sender MUST populate the To header
   of the Message/CPIM wrapper with the URI of the chat room.  The
   sender SHOULD populate the From header of the Message/CPIM wrapper
   with a proper identity by which the user is recognized in the
   conference.  Identities that can be used (among others) are:

   o  A SIP URI [RFC3261] representing the participant's address-of-
      record

   o  A tel URI [RFC3966] representing the participant's telephone
      number

   o  An IM URI [RFC3860] representing the participant's instant
      messaging address

   o  An Anonymous URI representing the participant's anonymous address

   An MSRP switch that receives a SEND request from a participant SHOULD
   first verify that the From header field of the Message/CPIM wrapper
   is correctly populated with a valid URI of a participant.  This



Niemi, et al.            Expires March 23, 2012                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft            Multi-party Chat MSRP           September 2011


   imposes a requirement for the focus of the conference to inform the
   MSRP switch the URIs which the participant is known, in order for the
   MSRP switch to validate messages.  Section 6.3 provides further
   information with the actions to be taken in case this validation
   fails.

   If the MSRP switch receives a message containing several To header
   fields in the Message/CPIM wrapper the MSRP switch MUST reject the
   MSRP SEND request with a 403 response, as per procedures in RFC 4975
   [RFC4975].

   Then the MSRP switch should inspect the To header field of the
   Message/CPIM wrapper.  If the To header field of the Message/CPIM
   wrapper contains the chat room URI and there are no other To header
   fields, the MSRP switch can generate a copy of the SEND request to
   each of the participants in the conference except the sender.  The
   MSRP switch MUST NOT modify the content received in the SEND request.
   However, the MSRP switch MAY re-chunk any of the outbound MSRP SEND
   requests.

   Note that the MSRP switch does not need to wait for the reception of
   the complete MSRP chunk or MSRP message before it starts the
   distribution to the rest of the participants.  Instead, once the MSRP
   switch has received the headers of the Message/CPIM body it SHOULD
   start the distribution process.  Having the Message/CPIM header only
   in the first chunk, the MSRP switch MUST track the Message-Id until
   the last chunk of the message has been distributed.

   An MSRP endpoint that receives a SEND request from the MSRP switch
   containing a Message/CPIM wrapper SHOULD first inspect the To header
   field of the Message/CPIM body.  If the To header field is set to the
   chat room URI, it should render it as a regular message that has been
   distributed to all the participants in the conference.  Then the MSRP
   endpoint SHOULD inspect the From header field of the Message/CPIM
   body to identify the sender.  The From header field will include a
   URI that identifies the sender.  The endpoint might have also
   received further identity information through a subscription to a
   conference event package.

6.2.  Private Messages

   This section describes the conventions used to send and receive
   private instant messages, i.e., instant messages that are addressed
   to one participant of the chat room rather to all of them.  A chat
   room can signal support for private messages using the chatroom-
   attribute (see Section 8 for details).

   When a chat room participant wishes to send a private instant message



Niemi, et al.            Expires March 23, 2012                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft            Multi-party Chat MSRP           September 2011


   to a participant the chat room, it follows the same procedures for
   creating a SEND request as for regular messages (Section 6.1).  The
   only difference is that the MSRP endpoint MUST populate a single To
   header of the Message/CPIM with the identity of the intended
   recipient.  The identity can be SIP, TEL, and IM URIs typically
   learned from the information received in notifications of a
   conference event package.

   As for regular messages, an MSRP switch that receives a SEND request
   from a participant SHOULD first verify that the From header field of
   the Message/CPIM wrapper is correctly populated with a valid URI
   (i.e., the URI is a participant of this chat room).  Section 6.3
   provides further information with the actions to be taken in case
   this validation fails.

   If the MSRP switch receives a message containing several To header
   fields in the Message/CPIM wrapper the MSRP switch MUST reject the
   MSRP SEND request with a 403 response, as per procedures in RFC 4975
   [RFC4975].

   Then the MSRP switch MUST verify that the To header of the Message/
   CPIM wrapper is a participant of the chat room.  If this To header
   field does not contain the URI of a participant of the chat room or
   if the To header field cannot be resolved (e.g., caused by a mistyped
   URI), the MSRP switch MUST reject the request with a 404 response.
   This new 404 status code indicates a failure to resolve the recipient
   URI in the To header field of the Message/CPIM wrapper.

      Notice the importance of the From and To headers in the Message/
      CPIM wrapper.  If an intermediary modifies these values, the MSRP
      switch might not be able to identify the source or intended
      destination of the message, resulting in a rejection of the
      message.

   Finally, the MSRP switch MUST verify that the recipient supports
   private messages.  If the recipient does not support private
   messages, the MSRP switch MUST reject the request with a 428
   response.  This new response 428 indicate that the recipient does not
   support private messages.  Any potential REPORT request that the MSRP
   switch sends to the sender MUST include a Message/CPIM wrapper
   containing the original From header field included in the SEND
   request and the To header field of the original Message/CPIM wrapper.
   The MSRP switch MUST NOT forward private messages to a recipient that
   does not support private messaging.

   If successful, the MSRP switch should search its mapping table to
   find the MSRP sessions established towards the recipient.  If a match
   is found the MSRP switch MUST create a SEND request and MUST copy the



Niemi, et al.            Expires March 23, 2012                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft            Multi-party Chat MSRP           September 2011


   contents of the sender's message to it.

   An MSRP endpoint that receives a SEND request from the MSRP switch
   does the same validations as for regular messages (Section 6.1).  If
   the To header field is different from the chat room URI, the MSRP
   endpoints knows that this is a private message.  The endpoint should
   render who it is from based on the value of the From header of the
   Message/CPIM wrapper.  The endpoint can also use the sender's
   nickname, possibly learned via a conference event package, to render
   such nickname rather than the sender's actual URI.

   It is possible that a participant, identified by a SIP Address of
   Record or other valid URI, joins a conference of instant messages
   from two or more different SIP UAs.  It is RECOMMENDED that the the
   MSRP switch can map a URI to two or more MSRP sessions.  If the
   policy of the server allows for this, the MSRP switch MUST copy all
   messages intended to the recipient through each MSRP session mapped
   to the recipient's URI.

6.3.  MSRP reports and responses

   This section discusses the common procedures for regular and private
   messages with respect to MSRP reports and responses.  Any particular
   procedure affecting only regular messages or only private messages is
   discussed in the previous Section 6.1 or Section 6.2, respectively.

   MSRP switches MUST follow the success report and failure report
   handling described in section 7 of RFC 4975 [RFC4975], complemented
   with the procedures described in this section.  The MSRP switch MUST
   act as an MSRP endpoint receiver of the request according to section
   5.3 of RFC 4975 [RFC4975].

   If the MSRP switch receives an MSRP SEND request that does not
   contain a Message/CPIM wrapper, the MSRP switch MUST reject the
   request with a 415 response (specified in RFC 4975 [RFC4975]).

   If the MSRP switch receives an MSRP SEND request where the URI
   included in the From header field of the Message/CPIM wrapper is not
   valid, (e.g, because it does not "belong" to the sender of the
   message or is not a valid participant of the chat room), the MSRP
   switch MUST reject the request with a 403 response.  In non-error
   cases, the MSRP switch MUST construct responses according to section
   7.2 of RFC 4975 [RFC4975].

   When the MSRP swtich forwards a SEND request, it MAY use any report
   model in the copies intended for the recipients.  The receiver
   reports from the recipients MUST NOT be forwarded to the originator
   of the original SEND request.  This could lead to having the sender

Internet-Draft            Multi-party Chat MSRP           September 2011


   receiving multiple reports for a single MSRP request.


7.  Nicknames

   A common characteristic of existing chat room services is that
   participants have the ability to present themselves with a nickname
   to the rest of the participants of the conference.  It is used for
   easy reference of participants in the chat room, and can also provide
   anonymous participants with a meaningful descriptive name.

   A nickname is a useful construct in many use cases, of which MSRP
   chat is but one example.  It is associated with a URI of which the
   participant is known to the focus.  It is a user selectable
   appearance of which the participant wants to be known to the other
   participants.  It is not a 'display-name', but it is used somewhat
   like a display name.  A main difference is that a nickname is unique
   inside a chat room to allow an unambiguous reference to a participant
   in the chat.  Nicknames may be long lived, or may be temporary.
   Users also need to reserve a nickname prior to its utilization.

   This memo specifies the nickname as a string.  The nickname string
   MUST be unambiguous within the scope of the chat room (conference
   instance).  This scope is similar to having a nickname unique inside
   a chat room from Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
   [RFC6120].  The chat room may have policies associated with
   nicknames.  It may not accept nickname strings at all, or a it may
   provide a wider unambiguous scope like a domain or server, similar to
   Internet Relay Chat (IRC) [RFC2810].

7.1.  Using Nicknames within a Conference

   This memo provides a mechanism to reserve a nickname for a
   participant for as long as the participant is logged into the chat
   room.  The mechanism is based on a NICKNAME MSRP method (see below)
   and a new "Use-Nickname" header.  Note that other mechanisms may
   exist (for example, a web page reservation system), although they are
   outside the scope of this document.

   A conference participant who has established an MSRP session with the
   MSRP switch, where the MSRP switch has indicated the support and
   availability of nicknames with the 'nicknames' token in the
   'chatroom' SDP attribute, MAY send a NICKNAME request to the MSRP
   switch.  The NICKNAME request MUST include a new Use-Nickname header
   that contains the nickname string that the participant wants to
   reserve.  MSRP NICKNAME requests MUST NOT include Success-Report or
   Failure-Report header fields.




Niemi, et al.            Expires March 23, 2012                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft            Multi-party Chat MSRP           September 2011


   The MSRP switch that receives a NICKNAME request containing a
   nickname in the Use-Nickname header field SHOULD first verify whether
   the policy of the chat room allows the nickname functionality.  If
   not allowed, the MSRP switch must reject the request with a 501
   response, as per RFC 4975 [RFC4975].

   If the policy of the chat room allows the usage of nicknames, the
   MSRP switch SHOULD validate that the SIP AOR is entitled to reserve
   the nickname.  The participant's authenticated identity can be
   derived after a successful HTTP Digest Authentication (applied to
   SIP), included in a trusted SIP P-Asserted-Identity header field,
   included in a valid SIP Identity header field, or derived from any
   other present or future SIP authentication mechanism.  Once the MSRP
   switch has validated that the participant is entitled to reserve the
   nickname, the MSRP switch MUST answer the NICKNAME request with a 200
   response as per regular MSRP procedures.

   The reservation of a nickname can fail, e.g. if the NICKNAME request
   contains a malformed or non-existent Use-Nickname header field, or if
   the same nickname has already been reserved by another participant in
   the conference.  The validation can also fail where the sender of the
   message is not entitled to reserve the nickname.  In any of these
   cases the MSRP switch MUST answer the NICKNAME request with a 423
   response.  The semantics of the 423 response are: "Nickname usage
   failed; the nickname is not allocated to this user".

   As indicated earlier, this specification defines a new MSRP header
   field: "Use-Nickname".  The Use-Nickname header field carries a
   nickname string, and SHOULD be included in the NICKNAME requests.

   The syntax of the NICKNAME method and the "Use-Nickname" header field
   is built upon the MSRP formal syntax [RFC4975]

               ext-method =/ NICKNAMEm
               NICKNAMEm = %x4E.49.43.4B.4E.41.4D.45 ; NICKNAME in caps
               ext-header =/ Use-Nickname
               ; ext-header is specified in RFC 4975
               Use-Nickname = "Use-Nickname" ":" nickname
               nickname = quoted-string

7.2.  Modifying a Nickname

   Typically a participant will reserve a nickname as soon as the
   participant joins the chat room.  But it is also possible for a
   participant to modify his/her own nickname and replace it with a new
   one at any time during the duration of the MSRP session.
   Modification of the nickname is not different from the initial
   reservation and usage of a nickname, thus the NICKNAME method is used



Niemi, et al.            Expires March 23, 2012                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft            Multi-party Chat MSRP           September 2011


   as described in Section 7.1.

   If a NICKNAME request that attempts to modify the current nickname of
   the user for some reason fails, the current nickname stays in effect.
   A new nickname comes into effect and the old one is released only
   after a NICKNAME request is accepted with a 200 response.

7.3.  Removing a Nickname

   If the participant no longer wants to be known by a nickname in the
   conference, the participant can follow the method described in
   Section 7.2.  The nickname element of the Use-Nickname header MUST be
   set to an empty quoted string.

7.4.  Nicknames in Conference Event Packages

   Typically the conference focus acts as a notifier of the conference
   event package.  To notify subscribers of the nickname reserved for a
   given participant, it is RECOMMENDED that conference focus and
   endpoints support Conference Event Package Data Format Extension for
   Centralized Conferencing [I-D.ietf-xcon-event-package].  The
   Conference Information Data Model for Centralized Conferencing
   [I-D.ietf-xcon-common-data-model] extends the user element from RFC
   4575 [RFC4575] with a nickname attribute.


8.  The SDP 'chatroom' attribute

   There are a handful of use cases where a participant would like to
   learn the chat room capabilities supported by the MSRP switch and the
   chat room.  For example, a participant would like to learn if the
   MSRP switch supports private messaging, otherwise, the participant
   may send what he believes is a private instant message addressed to a
   participant, but since the MSRP switch does not support the functions
   specified in this memo, the message gets eventually distributed to
   all the participants of the chat room.

   The reverse case also exists.  A participant, say Alice, whose user
   agent does not support the extensions defined by this document joins
   the chat room.  The MSRP switch learns that Alice application does
   not support private messaging nor nicknames.  If another participant,
   say Bob, sends a private message to Alice, the MSRP switch does not
   distribute it to Alice, because Alice is not able to differentiate it
   from a regular message sent to the whole roster.  Further more, if
   Alice replied to this message, she would do it to the whole roster.
   Because of this, the MSRP switch keeps also track of users who do not
   support the extensions defined in this document.




Niemi, et al.            Expires March 23, 2012                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft            Multi-party Chat MSRP           September 2011


   In another scenario, the policy of a chat room may indicate that
   certain functions are not allowed.  For example, the policy may
   indicate that nicknames or private messages are not allowed.

   In order to provide the user with a good chat room experience, we
   define a new 'chatroom' SDP attribute.  The 'chatroom' attribute is a
   media-level attribute that MAY be included in conjunction with and
   MSRP media stream (i.e., when an m= line in SDP indicates "TCP/MSRP"
   or "TCP/TLS/MSRP").  The 'chatroom' attribute indicates the
   intersection of support and chat room local policy allowance for a
   number of functions specified in this document.  Specifically, we
   provide the means for indicating support to use nicknames and private
   messaging.

   The 'chatroom' SDP attribute has the following syntax:

             chatroom = chatroom-label ":" chat-token *(SP chat-token)
             chatroom-label = "chatroom"
             chat-token = (nicknames-token | private-msg-token | token)
             nicknames-token = "nicknames"
             private-msg-token = "private-messages"

   A conference focus that includes the 'nicknames' token in the session
   description is signaling that the MSRP switch supports and the chat
   room allows to use of the procedures specified in Section 7.  A
   conference focus that includes the 'private-messages' in the SDP
   description is signaling that the MSRP switch supports and the chat
   room allows to use of the procedures specified in Section 6.2.

   Example of the 'chatroom' attribute for an MSRP media stream that
   indicates the acceptance of nicknames and private messages:

             a=chatroom:nickname private-messages

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  New MSRP Method

   This specification defines a new MSRP method to be added to the
   Methods sub-registry of the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
   Parameters registry:

      NICKNAME

   See section Section 7 for details.

Internet-Draft            Multi-party Chat MSRP           September 2011


10.2.  New MSRP Header

   This specification defines a new MSRP header to be added to the
   Header Field sub-registry of the Message Session Relay Protocol
   (MSRP) Parameters registry:

      Use-Nickname

   See Section 7 for details.

10.3.  New MSRP Status Codes

   This specification defines three new MSRP status codes to be added to
   the Status-Code sub-registry of the Message Session Relay Protocol
   (MSRP) parameters registry.

   The 404 status code indicates the failure to resolve the recipient
   URI in the To header field of the Message/CPIM wrapper in the SEND
   request, e.g, due to an unknown recipient.  See Section 6.2 for
   details.

   The 423 response indicates a failure in allocated the requested
   NICKNAME.  This can be caused by a malformed NICKNAME request (e.g.,
   no Use-Nickname header field), an already allocated nickname, or a
   policy that prevents the sender to use nicknames.  See Section 7 for
   details.

   The 428 status code indicates that the recipient of a SEND request
   does not support private messages.  See section Section 6.2 for
   details.

   Table 1 summarizes the IANA registration data with respect to new
   MSRP status codes:

       +-------+---------------------------------------+-----------+
       | Value | Description                           | Reference |
       +-------+---------------------------------------+-----------+
       |  404  | Failure to resolve recipient's URI    |  RFC XXXX |
       |  423  | Unable to allocate requested nickname |  RFC XXXX |
       |  428  | Private messages not supported        |  RFC XXXX |
       +-------+---------------------------------------+-----------+

Internet-Draft            Multi-party Chat MSRP           September 2011


10.4.  New SDP Attribute

   This specification defines a new media-level attribute in the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters registry.  The registration
   data is as follows:

      Contact: Miguel Garcia <miguel.a.garcia@ericsson.com>

      Phone: +34 91 339 1000

      Attribute name: chatroom

      Long-form attribute name: Chat Room

      Type of attribute: media level only

      This attribute is not subject to the charset attribute

      Description: This attribute identifiers support and local policy
      allowance for a number of chatroomt related functions

      Specification: RFC XXXX

   See section Section 8 for details.


11.  Security Considerations

   This document proposes extensions to the Message Session Relay
   Protocol [RFC4975].  Therefore, the security considerations of such
   document apply to this document as well.

   If the participant's SIP user agent doesn't understand the the
   "isfocus" feature tag [RFC3840], it will not know that it is
   connected to a conference instance.  The participant might not be
   notified that the participant's MSRP client will try to send messages
   to the MSRP switch having potentially multiple recipients.  If the
   participant's MSRP client doesn't support the extensions of this
   specification, it is unlikley that it will try to send a message
   using 'Message/CPIM' wrapper content type [RFC3862], and the MSRP
   switch will reject the request with a 415 response [RFC4975].  Still
   if particpants's MSRP client does create a message with a valid
   'Message/CPIM' wrapper content type [RFC3862] having the To header
   set to the URI of the chat room and the From header set to the URI of
   which the participant is known to the conference, the paricipant
   might be unaware that the message can be forwarded to multiple
   recipients.  Equally if the To header is set to a valid URI of a
   recipient known to the conference, the message can be forwarded as a

   private message without the participant knowing.

   If a participant wants to avoid eavesdropping, the participant's MSRP
   client can send the messages over a TLS [RFC5246] transport
   connection, as allowed by MSRP.  It's up to the policy of the MSRP
   switch if the messages are forwarded to the other participant's in
   the chat room using TLS [RFC5246] transport.

   Nicknames will be used to show the appearances of the participants of
   the conference.  A successful take over of a nickname from a
   participant might lead to private messages to be sent to the wrong
   destination.  The recipient's URI will be different from the URI
   associated to the original owner of the nickname, but the sender
   might not notice this.  To avoid take overs the MSRP switch MUST make
   sure that a nickname is unique inside a chat room.  Also the security
   consideration for any authenticated identity mechanisms used to
   validate the SIP AOR will apply to this document as well.  If a
   nickname can be reserved if it previously has been used by another
   participant in the chat room, is up to the policy of the chat room.
