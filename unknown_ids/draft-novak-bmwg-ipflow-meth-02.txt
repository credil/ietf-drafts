Internet-Draft        Flow Monitoring Benchmarking          March 2009



1.  Introduction

   Monitoring of IP flows (Flow Monitoring) on network devices is an
   application which has numerous usage in both service provider and
   enterprise segments as detailed in the IPFIX requirements [RFC3917] 
   and is widely used in both these deployment areas.

    The goal of this document is to address measurement of Flow
    Monitoring performance in a way comparable amongst various
    implementations and to provide methodology for [RFC2544]
    (Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices)
    measurements in the presence of Flow Monitoring on the network
    device.

    This document identifies as the main parameter which has major
    performance impact on the network devices the rate at which flows
    are created and expired in the devices memory and proposes
    methodology how to quantify this impact in a black box test manner.
    The impact of Flow Monitoring on the network devices central
    processor unit utilisation is out of scope of this document to avoid
    white box testing even though it represents an interesting
    performance metrics.
   
2. Document Scope

   The purpose of this draft is to define a methodology for measurement
   of Flow Monitoring performance itself. Since Flow Monitoring will be
   in most cases run on network devices forwarding packets, methodology
   for RFC2544 measurements in the presence of Flow Monitoring is also
   proposed here.

   Flow Monitoring is defined in the IPFIX specification [RFC5101] and
   related documents (see section 5 for more details). 

   [RFC2544], [RFC5180] and [MPLS] specify benchmarking of network
   devices forwarding IPv4, IPv6 and MPLS traffic, respectively. This
   draft document also proposes the methodology of performing this kind
   of benchmarking in the presence of Flow Monitoring, but not
   necessarily restricted to IPv4, IPv6 and MPLS traffic types. The
   methodology stays same for any traffic, the only restriction is what
   the actual Flow Monitoring implementation supports.

3. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make
   the intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While
   this document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards
   track document.

4. Flow Monitoring Documents

4.1 IPFIX Documents Overview
   
    The IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101] provides network administrators with
    access to   IP Flow information.

    The architecture for the export of measured IP Flow information out
    of an IPFIX Exporting Process to a Collecting Process is defined in
    the IPFIX Architecture [IPFIX-ARCH], per the requirements defined 
    in RFC 3917 [RFC3917].
     
    The IPFIX Architecture [IPFIX-ARCH] specifies how IPFIX Data Records
    and Templates are carried via a congestion-aware transport protocol
    from IPFIX Exporting Processes to IPFIX Collecting Processes.
     
    IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX Information Elements, their
    name, type and additional semantic information, as specified in the
    IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102].
     
    Finally the IPFIX Applicability Statement [IPFIX-AS] describes what
    type of applications can use the IPFIX protocol and how they can
    use the information provided. It furthermore shows how the IPFIX
    framework relates to other architectures and frameworks.

4.2 PSAMP Documents Overview
     
    The document "A Framework for Packet Selection and Reporting"
    [PSAMP-FMWK], describes the PSAMP framework for network elements to
    select subsets of packets by statistical and other methods, and to
    export a stream of reports on the selected packets to a collector.
     
    The set of packet selection techniques (sampling, filtering, and
    hashing) supported by PSAMP are described in "Sampling and Filtering
    Techniques for IP Packet Selection" [PSAMP-TECH].
     
    The PSAMP protocol [PSAMP-PROTO] specifies the export of packet
    information from a PSAMP Exporting Process to a PSAMP Collecting
    Process.  Like IPFIX, PSAMP has a formal description of its
    information elements, their name, type and additional semantic
    information.  The PSAMP information model is defined in [PSAMP-INFO].

    Finally [PSAMP-MIB] describes the PSAMP Management Information Base.

   Definition:
      Memory area held and dedicated by the DUT to store Flow Record 
      information

5.2.2 Cache Size

   Definition:
      The size of the cache in terms of how many entries of Flow 
      Records the cache can hold

   Discussion:
      This term is typically represented as a configurable option in
      the particular Flow Monitoring implementation. It MUST be at
      least known in order to define the tests circumstances properly.
      Its highest value will depend on the memory available in the 
      network device.
                     
   Measurement units: 
      Number of entries

5.2.3 Active Timeout

   Definition:
      The time interval from the time when first packet of a particular
      Flow was seen till the Flow will be expired while there are still
      packets arriving to the DUT which belong to the Flow. 

   Discussion:
      This term is typically represented as a configurable option in the
      particular Flow Monitoring implementation. See section 5.1.1 of
      [IPFIX-ARCH] for more detailed discussion.
 
   Measurement units: 
      Seconds

5.2.4 Inactive Timeout

   Definition:
      The time interval after which the Flow is expired from the Cache 
      if no more packets which belong to the Flow were seen

   Discussion:
      This term is typically represented as a configurable option in the
      particular Flow Monitoring implementation. See section 5.1.1 of
      [IPFIX-ARCH] for more detailed discussion.
 
   Measurement units: 
      Seconds

5.2.5 Flow Expiration Rate 
       
   Definition:
      Number of Flow Records which expire (as defined by the Flow 
      Expiration term) from the Cache within a time interval

   Measurement units:
      Number of Flow Records per second 

5.2.6 Flow Monitoring Throughput

   Definition:
      The maximum Flow Expiration Rate the DUT can sustain without
      losing  any information about any offered Flow while exporting
      the Flow information to an external collecting device (Collector)
      and as measured at the Collector

   Discussion: 
      Flow Monitoring Throughput is the equivalent of [RFC1242]
      (Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnection Devices) 
      packet forwarding throughput which allows to measure a single
      number to compare different implementations.
      Flow Monitoring requires quite considerable processing power to
      collect, store, process and export all the information about the

      Flows passing through the DUT and the expected value is
      therefore several orders of magnitude lower than pure packet
      forwarding throughput

    Measurement units:
      Number of Flow Records per second

6.1 Test Topology

   The test set-up is identical to the one used by [RFC2544], with just
   an addition of a Collector to analyse the Flow Export:

    The ideal way to implement the test is using one traffic generator
    (device providing the sender and receiver capabilities) with
    a sending

   port and a receiving port. This allows for an easy check if all the
   traffic sent by the sender was transmitted by the DUT and received
   at the receiver.

   If the effects of enabling Flow Monitoring on several interfaces are
   of concern or the media maximum speed is less that the DUT throughput,
   the topology can be expanded with several input and output ports.

6.2 Base DUT Set Up

   The base DUT set up and the way the set-up is reported in the test
   results is fully specified in Section 7 of [RFC2544].

   The base DUT configuration might include other features like packet
   filters or quality of service on the input and/or output interfaces
   if there is the need to study Flow Monitoring in the presence of
   those features. The Flow Monitoring measurement procedures do not 
   change in this case. Consideration needs to be made when evaluating
   measurements results to take into account the possible change of
   packets rates offered to the DUT and Flow Monitoring after application
   of the features to the configuration.

6.3 Flow Monitoring Configuration

   The DUT Observation Points configuration needs to be decided upon 
   depending on the interest and scope of the testing as follows:

      a. input port/ports only
      b. output port/ports only
      c. both input and output

   Generally, the placement of Observation Points depends on the position
   of the DUT in the deployed network and the purpose of Flow Monitoring
   deployment. 

   The testing procedures are otherwise same for all these possible
   configurations.
   
   To measure input and output simultaneously on one DUT port the
   topology in the Figure 1 can be used if the traffic sender and 
   receiver allows for full duplex operation e.g. sender can
   simultaneously receive and analyse traffic and receiver can 
   simultaneously also send traffic then the topology can be used as it 
   is. The only change is in the configurations of the sender and
   receiver to allow full duplex operation.

   Cache Size available to the DUT operation MUST be known and taken 
   into account when designing the test as specified in the section 7.

   Flow Export MUST be configured in such a way that all Flow Record 
   information from all configured Observation Points is exported. This
   ensures that Flow Expiration Rate as measured from the Collector data

Internet-Draft        Flow Monitoring Benchmarking          March 2009

   includes all the Flow information handled by the DUT at the time of
   the measurement. The measurement time to be used to capture Flow
   Export data and to calculate Flow Expiration Rate is defined in 
   sections 7.1 and 7.2.

   Various Flow Monitoring implementations might use different default
   values regarding the export of Control Information. The Flow Export
   corresponding to Control Information SHOULD be analysed and reported
   as a separate item on the test report. 

6.4 Collector

   The Collector MUST be capable to capture at the full rate the export
   packets sent from the DUT without losing any of them. It does not 
   have to have any Flow Export decoding capabilities itself, just needs
   to provide the captured data in the hexadecimal format for an off-line
   analysis which can be done after each performed measurement. During
   the analysis the Flow Export data need to be decoded and the received
   Flow information counted. The Flow Expiration Rate will be obtained
   from this data as the number of Flows seen in the captured data at the
   Collector divided by the measurement time as specified in the section 7.

   The Collector SHOULD support Ethernet type of interface to connect to
   the DUT but any media which allow data capturing and analysis can be
   used.

   The capture buffer MUST be cleared beforehand each measurement.

   The calculated Flow Expiration Rate SHOULD include the Flow Export
   corresponding to the Control Information.

6.5 Packet Sampling

   A Flow Monitoring implementation might provide the capability to
   analyse the flows after packet sampling is performed. The possible 
   procedures and ways of packet sampling are described in [PSAMP-PROTO]
   and [PSAMP-TECH] and only those should be used for measurements.

   This document does not intend to study the effects of packet sampling
   itself on the network devices but packet sampling can simply be
   applied as part of the Flow Monitoring configuration on the DUT and 
   perform the measurements as specified in the later sections. 
   Consideration needs to be made when evaluating measurements results
   to take into account the change of packets rates offered to the DUT
   and especially to Flow Monitoring after packet sampling is applied.

6.6 Frame Formats

   Flow Monitoring itself is not dependent in any way on the media used
   on the input and output ports, any media can be used as supported by
   the DUT and the test equipment.

   The most common media and frame formats for IPv4, IPv6 and MPLS
   traffic are specified within [RFC2544], [RFC5180] and [MPLS].

6.7 Frame Sizes

   Frame sizes to use are specified in [RFC2544] section 9 for Ethernet
   type interfaces (64, 128, 256, 1024, 1280, 1518 bytes) and in
   [RFC5180] section 5 for Packet over Sonet interfaces (47, 64, 128,
   256, 1024, 1280, 1518, 2048, 4096 bytes).

6.8 Flow Records

   The Flow Record definition is very implementation specific. A Flow
   Monitoring implementation might allow only for fixed Flow Record
   definition, based on the most common IP parameters in the IPv4 or
   IPv6 headers - like source and destination IP addresses, IP
   protocol numbers or transport level port numbers. Another
   implementation might allow the user to actually define his own
   completely arbitrary Flow Record to monitor the traffic. The
   requirement for the tests defined in this document is only the need
   for a large number of Flow Records in the Cache. The Flow Keys needed
   to achieve that will typically be source and destinations IP addresses
   and transport level port numbers.

   Example Flow Record:
     Flow Key fields
                Source IP address
                Destination IP address
                Transport layer source port
                Transport layer destination port
                IP protocol
                IP Type of Service or IP flow label

     Other Fields 
                Packet counter
                Byte counter 

7. Flow Monitoring Throughput Measurement Methodology

   Objective: To define and measure metrics fully expressing the Flow
              Monitoring performance which can be used to compare different
              implementations.

   Definition: section 5.2.6
  
   The Flow Expiration Rate the DUT can achieve without losing any Flow
   information depends on the combination of a number of Flow Monitoring
   parameters and traffic patterns offered to the DUT. This makes it
   a complex task to define and measure a single metrics which would
   characterise the Flow Monitoring performance. There are two Flow
   Monitoring operational modes which need to be distinguished and
   measured separately while using the same metrics.

7.1 Normal Cache Mode

   In the normal cache mode the DUT MUST hold less Flow Records in the
   Cache than the available Cache Size during the whole test.

7.1.1 Flow Monitoring Configuration Parameters 

   Cache Size: 
      Maximum available value on the network device

   Inactive Timeout
      Minimum possible value on the network device

   Active Timeout 
      Higher or equal value to the Inactive Timeout

   Flow Keys Definition:
      Needs to allow for large numbers of unique Flow Records to be
      created in the Cache by incrementing one or several Flow Keys.
      The number of unique combinations of Flow Keys MUST be larger than
      the DUT Cache Size or larger than the product of the offered
      packet rate and the Inactive Timeout so that the flows in the
      Cache never get updated before they expire.

7.1.2 Traffic Configuration Parameters

   Traffic Generation
      The traffic generator when sending the packets needs to increment
      the packet header values defined as Flow Keys values in the Flow
      Record with each sent packet. Each packet then represents one Flow
      Record in the DUT Cache and the packet rate equals to the Flow
      Expiration Rate.

   Maximum Packet Rate
      The maximum packet rate which can be used for the normal cache
      mode measurement is the Cache Size divided by the Inactive Timeout.
      If the Flow Monitoring implementation allows to configure Inactive
      Timeout 0 then any packet rate is possible to be used. This makes
      sure the Flows expire from the Cache before it becomes full.

7.1.3 Measurement Time
  
      The measurement time to be used to calculate Flow Monitoring
      Throughput as specified in the section 6.4 is equal to the time
      interval when traffic is offered to the DUT. The Collector MUST
      continue capturing export data at least for the Inactive Timeout
      period after the traffic generation is stopped. This ensures that
      all the Flows created in the DUT Cache will be exported and
      analysed.

Internet-Draft        Flow Monitoring Benchmarking          March 2009


7.1.4 Procedure

   The measurement procedure is same as the Throughput measurement in
   the section 26.1 of [RFC2544] for the traffic sending side.
   The output analysis is not done on the DUT receiving side but the
   analysed quantity for the measurement of the maximum rate value is
   the Flow count as provided by the Flow Export data Captured at the 
   Collector as specified in the section 6.4.

   If the maximum packet rate (as specified in the section 7.1.2) does
   not cause the DUT to drop any Flow then the reported Flow Monitoring
   Throughput SHOULD be equal to the maximum packet rate. The
   limitation here is that the configurable values of Cache Size and
   Inactive Timeout do not allow to test with higher Flow Expiration
   Rates in normal Cache mode. 

7.2 Cache Overflow Mode

   In the cache overflow mode the DUT MUST have the Cache fully 
   occupied by Flow Records at any time during the measurement.

7.2.1 Flow Monitoring Configuration Parameters 

   Cache Size
      Cache Size should be configured to a moderate size accordingly to
      the expected DUT position in the network. Its value may be
      limited by the fact that the number of unique Flow Keys sets
      which the traffic generator (sender) can provide should be
      multiple times larger than the Cache Size to make sure no Flow
      gets refreshed by another packet before it expires from the Cache.

      Example Cache Sizes:
         Small office device  - 5 to 10 000 entries
         Medium access device - 50 to 100 000 entries
         Backbone device      - 500 000 and higher

   Inactive Timeout
      Maximum possible value on the network device. The value has to be
     larger than the Cache Size divided by the test packet rate offered 
     to the DUT to make sure the Flows do not expire from the Cache
     before the number of Flows in the Cache reach the Cache Size.

   Active Timeout 
      Higher or equal value to the Inactive Timeout

   Flow Keys Definition:
      Needs to allow for large numbers of unique Flow Records to be
      created in the Cache by incrementing one or several Flow Keys. The
      number of unique combinations of Flow Keys values MUST be at least
      two times larger than the DUT Cache Size. This ensures that any

      incoming packet will never refresh any already existing Flow in
      the Cache and will cause another Flow to expire from the Cache.
      This is sometimes called emergency expiry as opposed to the
      inactive or active timeout of a Flow Record.

7.2.2 Traffic Configuration Parameters

   Traffic Generation
      The traffic generator needs to increment the Flow Keys values with
      each sent packet, this way each packet represents one Flow in the
      DUT Cache and the packet rate equals to the Flow Expiration Rate.

7.2.3 Measurement Time
  
   The measurement time to be used to calculate Flow Monitoring Throughput
   as specified in the section 6.4 is equal to the time interval when
   traffic is offered to the DUT minus the time needed to fully fill the 
   Cache calculated as (Cache Size divided by the test traffic packet rate
   during the measurement). The Collector MUST stop capturing export data
   immediately when the traffic generation is stopped. This ensures that
   the Flow Records exported later from the fully occupied Cache do not
   poison the measured Flow Monitoring Throughput.

7.2.4 Procedure


   The measurement procedure is same as the Throughput measurement in
   the section 26.1 of [RFC2544] for the traffic sending side.
   The output analysis is not done on the DUT receiving side but the
   analysed quantity for the measurement of the maximum rate value is
   the Flow count as provided by the Flow Export data Captured at the 
   Collector as specified in the section 6.4.

8. RFC2544 Measurements

   Objective: Provide RFC2544 network device characteristics in the             
   presence of Flow Monitoring on the DUT RFC2544 studies numerous
   characteristics of network devices. The purely forwarding 
   characteristics without Flow Monitoring present on the DUT can
   significantly vary when Flow Monitoring starts to be deployed on the
   network device. The objective of the section is to define controlled
   environment for Flow Monitoring during all the tests with all the
   parameters as specified below included in the test report.

8.1 Flow Monitoring Configuration

   Flow Monitoring Configuration needs to be applied the same way as
   discussed in the section 7 depending on the desired Cache test mode. 
   RFC2544 measurements which do not involve Throughput measurement can
   be set to be measured with fixed Flow Expiration Rate or at the
   value of it corresponding to the Flow Expiration Throughput.

Internet-Draft        Flow Monitoring Benchmarking          March 2009


   RFC2544 Throughput measurement with Flow Monitoring enabled
   represents two dimensional measurement and it depends on the DUT
   capabilities and test set-up if the maximum of both variables can be
   found at the same time as specified below.  

8.2 Single Traffic Component

   Section 12 of [RFC2544] discusses the use of protocol source and
   destination addresses for the in there defined tests. In order to
   perform all the RFC2544 type measurements with Flow Monitoring
   enabled the defined Flow Keys MUST contain IP source and destination
   address. The RFC2544 type measurements can be executed under these
   additional conditions:

      a. the test traffic does not use just single unique pair of source 
         and destination address
        
      b. the Sender allows to define test traffic as follows
            
         1) define the test exactly as specified in the section 7.1 or 7.2
         2) allow for a parameter to say send N (where N is an integer 
            number starting at 1 and incremented in small steps) packets 
            with IP addresses A and B before changing both IP addresses 
            to the next value

    This test traffic definition allows to execute the above defined IP 
    Flow Monitoring tests with one defined Flow Expiration Rate while 
    measuring at the same time the DUT RFC2544 characteristics. This
    set-up is the better option since it best simulates the live network
    traffic scenario with Flows containing more than just one packet.

    The initial packet rate at N equal to 1 defines the Flow Expiration
    Rate for the whole measurement procedure. The consequent increases of
    N do not change it anymore, the time and Cache characteristics of the
    test traffic stay the same. The initial rate needs to be chosen small
    enough to allow for the test traffic granular enough while allowing
    large enough value of Flow Expiration Rate for the measurement. The 
    best procedure is to measure Flow Expiration Throughput and RFC2544
    Throughput independently first and then design the rates for the
    mutual test.

8.3 Two Traffic Components

   The test traffic set-up in the section 8.2 might be difficult to 
   achieve with commercial traffic generators. The way around it is to 
   define two traffic components in the test traffic - one to populate 
   Flow Monitoring Cache and the second one to execute the RFC2544 
   tests.

   Flow Monitoring Test Traffic Component - the exact traffic definition 
   as specified in the sections 7.1 and 7.2.

Internet-Draft        Flow Monitoring Benchmarking          March 2009




   RFC2544 Test Traffic Component - test traffic as specified by 
   [RFC2544] but under the condition it MUST create just one Flow Record 
   in the DUT Cache. In the particular set-up discussed here this would 
   mean a traffic stream with just one pair of unique source and 
   destination IP address (but could be avoided if Flow Keys were for   
   example UDP/TCP source and destination ports and the Flow Record did
   not contain the addresses).

   The first traffic component will exercise the DUT in terms of 
   Flow activity while the second traffic component will measure the
   RFC2544 characteristics. The traffic rates to be reported as Throughput
   are the sum of rates of both components, other RFC2544 do not need any
   change.

9. Flow Monitoring Accuracy

   The pure Flow Monitoring tests in section 7 provide the capability to
   verify the Flow Monitoring accuracy in terms of the exported Flow
   Record data. Since every Flow Record created in the Cache is populated
   by just one packet, the full set of captured data on the Collector can
   be parsed (e.g. providing the exported Flow Record contents not only
   the Flow Record count) and each set of parameters from each Flow
   Record can be checked against the parameters as configured on the
   traffic generator and set in packets sent to the DUT. The exported
   Flow Record is considered accurate if:

      1. all the Flow Record fields are present in each exported Flow
         Record
      2. all the Flow Record fields values match the values ranges
         as set by the traffic generator (for example an IP address falls
         within the range of the IP addresses increments on the traffic
         generator)
      3. all the possible Flow Record fields values as defined at the 
         traffic generator have been found in the captured export data on
         the Collector. This check needs to be offset to potential
         detected packet loses during the test

   If Packet Sampling is deployed then only verifications in point 1
   and 2 can be performed.

   This verification can be eased by collecting some Flow Monitoring 
   statistics from the DUT.

10.Evaluating Flow Monitoring Applicability

   The results as discussed here obtained for certain DUT allow for
   a preliminary analysis of a Flow Monitoring deployment based on
   Internet traffic analysis data provided by organisations like
   [CAIDA] or performed on the network in question. The data needed to
   make an estimate if certain network device can manage the particular
   amount  of live traffic with Flow Monitoring enabled is:

Internet-Draft        Flow Monitoring Benchmarking          March 2009

   Average packet size:            350 bytes
   Number of packets per IP Flow:  20

   Expected data rate on the network device: 1 Gbit/s

   This results in:

   Expected packet rate: 357 000 pps  

      being (1 Gbit/s divided by 350 bytes/packet)

   Flows per second:   : 18 000

      being (packet rate 357 000 pps divided by 20 packets per IP Flow)

   Under constant load of traffic with the parameters above the network
   device will always run in the Cache Overflow mode (if the network is 
   large enough the Flows will hardly ever repeat itself within few 
   seconds needed to fill up lets say 300 000 entries Cache ? if the 
   Flow Keys contain parameters like IP addresses or transport level
   protocols and ports).

12.IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA considerations.

13.Security Considerations

   Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
   the Internet or corporate networks as long as benchmarking
   is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating
   networks.

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
   environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints
   specified in the sections above.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT.
