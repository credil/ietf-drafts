	<t>
	The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) has an IANA registry to allocate
	cryptographic algorithm suites for use in generating digital signatures over DNS data.
	Newly introduced cryptographic algorithms to DNSSEC mean implementors need to
	know which algorithms need to be implmented, which are optional, and which are obsolete.
	This document adds a column to the IANA registry table for Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC)
	Algorithm Numbers to list their status for use.

<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
	The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) <xref target="RFC4033" />, <xref target="RFC4034" />,
	and <xref target="RFC4035" /> uses digital signatures over DNS data
	to provide source authentication and integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA registry
	to allocate codes for digital signature algorithm (consisting of a cryptographic
	algorithm and one-way hash function).  Certain digital signature algorithms are
	considered MANDATORY to implement for interoperability while others are listed as
	OPTIONAL or OBSOLETE.
	</t>
	<t>
	Other DNSSEC documents have added new algorithms or changed the status of
	algorithms in the registry.  However, without reading all the documents, implementors
	must read through all the documents to discover which algorithms are MANDATORY to
	implement and which are OPTIONAL or obsolete.  
	</t>
	<t>
        This document requests a column to be added to the IANA registry for Domain Name
	System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers.  This column will list the current status of each digital
	signature algorithm in the registry.
	</t>
</section>
<section title="DNS Security Algorithm Number Subregisitry Fixes">
	<t>
	The DNS Security Algorithm Number subregistry (part of the Domain Name
	System (DNS) Security Number registry) will be modified to include a new column.
	This column will contain the current implementation status of the given algorithm.
	This status .  This document does not make any changes to any other column in the 
	registry table.
	</t>
	<t>
        There are additional fixes to entries that are described in sub-section 2.1.
	The overall new registry table is in sub-section 2.2.

  <section title="Individual Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Number Registry Entry Fixes">
        <t>
        This document changes three entries in the Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC)
	Algorithm Registry.  They are:
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for allocation number 8 is changed to "Reserved until 2020".
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for allocation number 9 is changed to "Reserved until 2020".
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for allocation number 11 is changed to "Reserved until 2020".

	This document consists entirely of DNS IANA Considerations and
   	includes the following changes detailed in Section 2.1:

	<t>
        The description of allocation 8 is changed from "Reserved for ECC" to

        The description of allocation 9 is changed from "Unassigned" to "Reserved

        The new table is in Section 2.2.  The Domain

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
	<t>
	This document seeks to add a column to an existing IANA registry.  It is not meant
	to be a discussion on algorithm superiority. No new security considerations are
	raised in this document.
