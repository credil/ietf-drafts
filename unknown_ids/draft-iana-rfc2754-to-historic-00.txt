              Request to Move RFC 2754 to Historic Status
                   draft-iana-rfc2754-to-historic-00

Abstract

   RFC 2754 requested that each time IANA made an address assignment, it
   was to create appropriate inetnum and as-block objects and digitally
   sign them.  The purpose was to distribute the IANA-held public key in
   software implementations of the Distributed Routing Policy System.
   In practice, this was never done on the public Internet.  This
   document requests that RFC 2754 be moved to historic status.

Internet-Draft         RFC 2754 to Historic Status          January 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (www.iana.org) is
   charged with allocating parameter values for fields in protocols
   which have been designed, created or are maintained by the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF).  RFC 2754 [RFC2754] requests that the
   IANA create a repository of Routing Policy System Language (RPSL)
   objects and digitally sign them.  The RFC identifies the initial
   objects to be signed and also requests that each time IANA makes an
   address assignment it also create new objects as needed and sign them
   as well.  In practice, this was never done in the public Internet.
   During a detailed review of IANA's protocol registration activities
   in support of the IETF, this request for IANA action was identified.

   This document obsoletes RFC 2754 [RFC2754], recommends that it be
   moved to historic status, and directs IANA to not move forward with
   the IANA in that RFC.

   The terms "Specification Required", "Expert Review", "IESG Approval",
   "IETF Review", and "Standards Action", are used in this memo to refer
   to the processes described in [RFC5226].


2.  Details

   RFC 2754 [RFC2754] requests that the IANA create a repository of RPSL
   objects and digitally sign them.  The RFC identifies the initial
   objects to be signed and also requests that each time IANA makes an
   address assignment it also create new objects as needed and sign them
   as well.

   During a review of RFC's in 2009 it became apparent that the IANA
   actions requested in RFC 2754 were never done.  In the intervening
   time, another technology appears to be taking the role once
   envisioned for Distributed RPSL.  Implementation of the IANA actions
   in RFC 2754 would now require significant implementation complexity.
   In the face of alternative technology, and given that the requested
   actions have not been implemented in the public Internet, it is
   proposed to reclassify RFC 2754 [RFC2754] as historic and to direct
   the IANA not to pursue or implement the IANA requests in that
   document.


3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119

   [RFC2119].

   The word "allocation" designates a block of addresses managed by a
   registry for the purpose of making assignments and allocations.  The
   word "assignment" designates a block of addresses, or a single
   address, registered to an end-user for use on a specific network, or
   set of networks.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is instructed not to pursue or implement the IANA actions
   requested in RFC 2754 [RFC2754]


5.  Security Considerations

   The intended signature of inetnum and as-block objects never took
   place in the public Internet.  Moving RFC 2754 [RFC2754] to historic
   status would have no known impact on the security of the Internet.


6.  Acknowledgments

   The author would like to thank Russ Housley, Leo Vegoda, Terry
   Manderson, Michelle Cotton and David Conrad for their constructive
   feedback and comments.
