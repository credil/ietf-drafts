                      The RPKI Ghostbusters Record
                    draft-ietf-sidr-ghostbusters-04

Abstract

   In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), resource
   certificates completely obscure names or any other information which
   might be useful for contacting responsible parties to deal with
   issues of certificate expiration, maintenance, roll-overs,
   compromises, etc.  This draft describes the RPKI Ghostbusters Record
   containing human contact information to be signed (indirectly) by a
   resource-owning certificate.  The data in the record are those of a
   severely profiled vCARD.

Internet-Draft        The RPKI Ghostbusters Record             June 2011


1.  Introduction

   In the operational use of the RPKI it can become necessary to
   contact, human to human, the party responsible for a resource-owning
   certificate.  An important example is when the owner of a Route
   Origin Authorization (ROA) sees a problem, or an impending problem,
   with a certificate or CRL in the path between the ROA and a trust
   anchor.  E.g., a certificate along that path has expired, is soon to
   expire, or a CRL associated with a CA along the path is stale, thus
   placing the quality of the routing of the address space described by
   the ROA in jeopardy.

   As the names in RPKI certificates are intentionally hashes which are
   not meaningful to humans, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-cp], there is no way to
   use a certificate itself to lead to the worrisome certificate's or
   CRL's maintainer.  So, "Who do you call?"

   This document specifies the RPKI Ghostbusters Record, an object
   signed, indirectly via an End Entity (EE) certificate, by the
   certificate whose maintainer may be contacted using the human usable
   payload information in the Ghostbusters Record.

   The Ghostbusters Record conforms to the syntax defined in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object].

   Note that the Ghostbusters Record is not an identity certificate, but
   rather an attestation to the contact data made by the issuer of the
   certificate signing the Ghostbusters Record.

   This record is not meant to supplant or be used as resource registry
   whois data.  It gives information about an RPKI certificate
   maintainer not a resource holder.

   This specification has three main sections.  The first, Section 4, is
   the format of the contact payload information, a severely profiled
   vCARD.  The second, Section 5, profiles the packaging of the payload
   as a profile of the RPKI Signed Object Template specification
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object].  The third, Section 6, describes the
   proper validation of the signed Ghostbusters Record.


2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands the RPKI,
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch], the RPKI Repository Structure,
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-repos-struct], Signed RPKI Objects,
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object], and vCARDs
   [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].

3.  RPKI Ghostbusters Record Payload Example

   An example of an RPKI Ghostbusters Record payload with all types
   populated is as follows:

     BEGIN:vCard
     VERSION:4.0
     FN:Human's Name
     N:Name;Human's;Ms.;Dr.;OCD;ADD
     ORG:Organizational Entity
     ADR;TYPE=WORK:;;42 Twisty Passage;Deep Cavern; WA; 98666;U.S.A.
     TEL;TYPE=VOICE,MSG,WORK:+1-666-555-1212
     TEL;TYPE=FAX,WORK:+1-666-555-1213
     EMAIL;TYPE=INTERNET:human@example.com
     END:vCard


4.  vCARD Profile

   The goal in profiling the vCARD is not to include as much information
   as possible, but rather to include as few types as possible while
   providing the minimal necessary data to enable one to contact the
   maintainer of the RPKI data which threatens the ROA[s] of concern.

   The Ghostbusters vCARD payload is a minimalist subset of the vCARD as
   described in [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].

   BEGIN -  pro forma packaging which MUST be the first line in the
      vCARD and MUST have the value "BEGIN:vCARD" as described in
      [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].

   VERSION -  pro forma packaging which MUST be the second line in the
      vCARD and MUST have the value "VERSION:4.0" as described in 3.6.9
      of [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].

   FN -  the name, as described in 6.2.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev], of a contactable person who
      responsible for the certificate.

   N -  the components of the name of the object the vCard represents,
      as described in 6.2.2 of [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].

   ORG -  an organization as described in 6.6.4 of
      [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].

Internet-Draft        The RPKI Ghostbusters Record             June 2011


   ADR -  a postal address as described in 6.3 of
      [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].

   TEL -  a voice and/or fax phone as described in 6.4.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].

   EMAIL -  an Email address as described in 6.4.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev]

   END -  pro forma packaging which MUST be the last line in the vCARD
      and MUST have the value "END:vCARD" as described in
      [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].

   Per [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev], the BEGIN, VERSION, FN, N, and END
   types MUST be included in a record.  To be useful, one or more of
   ADR, TEL, and EMAIL MUST be included.  Other types MUST NOT be
   included.


5.  CMS Packaging

   The Ghostbusters Record is a CMS signed-data object conforming to the
   Signed Object Template for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure,
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object].

   The ContentType of a Ghostbusters Record is defined as id-ct-
   rpkiGhostbusters, and has the numerical value of
   1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.35.  This OID MUST appear both within the
   eContentType in the encapContentInfo object as well as the
   ContentType signed attribute in the signerInfo object.  See
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object].

   eContent: The content of a Ghostbusters Record is described above in
   Section 4 above.

   Similarly to a ROA, the Ghostbusters Record is verified using an EE
   certificate issued under the CA certificate associated with the
   resource-holding certificate whose maintainer is described in the
   vCARD.

   The EE certificate used to verify the Ghostbusters Record is the one
   that appears in the CMS data structure that contains the payload
   defined above.


6.  Validation

   The validation procedure defined in Section 3 of



Bush                    Expires December 27, 2011               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        The RPKI Ghostbusters Record             June 2011


   [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object] is applied to a Ghostbusters Record.
   After this procedure has been performed, the Version number type
   within the payload is checked, and the OCTET STRING containing the
   vCARD data is extracted.  These data are checked against the profile
   defined in Section 4 of this document.  Only if all of these checks
   pass is the Ghostbusters payload deemed valid and made available to
   the application that requested the payload.


7.  Security Considerations

   Though there is no on the wire protocol in this specification, there
   are attacks which could abuse the data described.  As the data, to be
   useful, need to be public, little can be done to avoid this exposure.

   Phone Numbers:  The vCARDs may contain real world telephone numbers
      which could be abused for telemarketing, abusive calls, etc.

   Email Addresses:  The vCARDs may contain Email addresses which could
      be abused for purposes of spam.

   Relying parties are warned that the data in a Ghostbusters Record are
   self-asserted.  These data have not been verified by the CA that
   issued a (CA) certificate to the entity that issued the EE
   certificate used to validate the Ghostbusters Record.


8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  OID

   The IANA is requested to register the OID for the Ghostbusters Record
   in the registry created by [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object] as follows:

   Name          OID                         Specification
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   Ghostbusters  1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.35  [ This document ]

8.2.  File Extension

   The IANA is requested to add an item for the Ghostbusters Record file
   extension to the RPKI Repository Name Scheme created by
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-repos-struct] as follows:

   Filename Extension  RPKI Object           Reference
   -----------------------------------------------------------
      .gbr             Ghostbusters Record   [ This document ]

   rpki-ghostbusters as follows

   MIME media type name: application
   MIME subtype name: rpki-ghostbusters
