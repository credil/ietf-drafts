      <t>
        Some IMAP message stores include special-use mailboxes, such as those
        used to hold draft messages or sent messages.  Many mail clients allow
        users to specify where draft or sent messages should be put, but
        configuring them requires that the user know which mailboxes the
        server has set aside for these purposes.  This extension adds new
        mailbox flags that a server MAY include in IMAP LIST command responses
        to identify special-use mailboxes to the client, easing configuration.

        Some IMAP message stores include special-use mailboxes, such as those
        used to hold draft messages or sent messages.  Many mail clients allow
        users to specify where draft or sent messages should be put, but

      </t>

      <t>
        In addition, this extension adds an OPTIONAL parameter on the IMAP
        CREATE command, allowing a client to assign a special use to a mailbox
        when it is created.  Servers MAY choose to support this part of the
        extension, but are not required to.
      </t>

      <section title="Conventions used in this document">
        <t>
          In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
          to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.
        </t>
      
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
          are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="Kwds"/>.
        </t>        
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="New mailbox flags identifying special-use mailboxes">
      <t>
        An IMAP server that supports this extension MAY include any or all of the
        following flags in responses to the IMAP LIST command.  The new flags are
        included along with existing flags, such as "\Marked" and "\Noselect".
        A given mailbox may have none, one, or more than one of these flags.
        In some cases, a special use is advice to a client about what to put
        in that mailbox.  In other cases, it's advice to a client about what to
        expect to find there.
      </t>

      <t>
        The new flags defined here are as follows:
        <list style="hanging" hangIndent="5">
        <t hangText="&#92;Drafts"><vspace />
        This mailbox is used to hold draft messages -- typically, messages that
        are being composed but have not yet been sent.
        In some server implementations, this might be a virtual mailbox,
        containing messages from other mailboxes that are marked with the
        "\Draft" message flag.
        Alternatively, this might just be advice that a client put
        drafts here.
        </t>
        <t hangText="&#92;Inbox"><vspace />
        This mailbox is the inbox, where new incoming mail is placed by default.
        This will normally be the same as the mailbox with the name "inbox", as
        defined in the base IMAP protocol <xref target="IMAP"/>.
        </t>
        <t hangText="&#92;Sent"><vspace />
        This mailbox is used to hold copies of messages that have been sent.
        Some server implementations might put messages here automatically.
        Alternatively, this might just be advice that a client save
        sent messages here.
        </t>
        <t hangText="&#92;Spam"><vspace />
        This mailbox is where messages deemed to be "spam" (junk mail) are held.
        Some server implementations might put messages here automatically.
        Alternatively, this might just be advice to a client-side spam filter.
        </t>
        <t hangText="&#92;Starred"><vspace />
        This mailbox presents all messages marked as "important".
        When this special use is supported, it is likely to represent a
        virtual mailbox
        containing messages from other mailboxes that are marked with the
        "\Flagged" message flag.
        </t>
        <t hangText="&#92;Trash"><vspace />
        This mailbox is used to hold messages that have been deleted, or marked
        for deletion.
        In some server implementations, this might be a virtual mailbox,
        containing messages from other mailboxes that are marked with the
        "\Deleted" message flag.
        Alternatively, this might just be advice that a client that chooses
        not to use the IMAP "\Deleted" model should use this as its trash
        location.
        In server implementations that strictly expect the IMAP "\Deleted"
        model, this special use is likely not to be supported.
        </t>
        <t hangText="&#92;AllMail"><vspace />
        This mailbox presents all messages in the user's message store.
        Implementations MAY omit some messages, such as, perhaps, those in \Trash
        and \Spam.
        When this special use is supported, it is almost certain to represent a
        virtual mailbox.
        </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>
        All of the above flags are OPTIONAL, and any given server or message
        store may support any combination of the flags, or none at all.
        There is no capability string associated with this feature.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Extension to IMAP CREATE command to set special-use flags">
      <t>
        As an OPTIONAL feature, a server MAY allow clients to designate a
        mailbox, at creation, as having one or more special uses.  This
        extension defines the "USE" parameter to the IMAP CREATE command
        for that purpose.
        The new OPTIONAL "USE" parameter is followed by a parenthesized list
        of zero or more special-use flags, as defined above.
      </t>

      <t>
        In some server implementations, some special uses may imply automatic
        action by the server.
        For example, creation of a "\Spam" mailbox
        might cause the server to start placing messages that have been
        evaluated as spam into the mailbox.        
      </t>

      <t>
        In some server implementations, some special uses may result in a
        mailbox with unusual characteristics.
        For example, creation of an "\AllMail" mailbox might cause the server to
        create a virtual mailbox, rather than a standard one, and that mailbox
        might behave in unexpected ways (COPY into it might fail, for example).
      </t>

      <t>
        Servers MAY allow the creation
        of a special-use mailbox even if one so designated already exists, having
        the effect of moving the special use from the old mailbox to the
        new one.  Alternatively, servers MAY refuse the creation, considering
        the designation to be a conflict.
      </t>

      <t>
        If the server can not create a mailbox with the designated special use
        defined, for whatever reason, it MUST NOT create the mailbox, and MUST
        respond to the CREATE command with a tagged NO response.
      </t>

      <t>
        An IMAP server that supports this OPTIONAL feature will advertise the
        CREATE-SPECIAL-USE capability string.  Clients MUST NOT use the "USE"
        parameter unless the server advertises the capability.
      </t>
