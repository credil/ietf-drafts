    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a syntax and semantics as an extension of the
      Internet Message Format (e-mail message) allowing a Sending User of an
      e-mail message to express his or her preference for how the message
      content is to be handled by the Receiving Users. For this purpose,
      semantics of sets of different character combinations ("Privicons") are
      described. These can syntactically be integrated either in the
      first-line of the body, in the subject line and/or in a dedicated header
      of any e-mail message. The Privicons icon set consists of 6 different
      icons. They'll be machine readable. The Privicons concept is partly
      borrowing its approach from the concept of emoticons. For example, to
      express that the content may be forwarded and even be published, the
      Sending User could use the Privicon "[&gt;]", which may be followed by
      an additional explanations, such as "please share".</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section anchor="Overview" title="Overview">
        <t>Privicons describes a vocabulary of icons as an extension of the
        Internet Message Format (e-mail message) for users to indicate how
        their e-mail message should be treated. The icons are based on ASCII
        symbols so that they can appear as embedded graphics or plain text and
        include a variety of instructions such as "don't print," "internal use
        only," and "confidential". It is partly borrowing its approach from
        the concept of emoticons. For example to express, that the content can
        be forwarded and even be published, the Sending User could use the
        Privicon "[&gt;]", which may be followed by an additional
        explanations, such as "please share".</t>

        <t>This document proposes a <xref target="syntax">syntax</xref> and
        <xref target="semantics">semantics</xref> allowing a Sending User of
        an e-mail message to express his or her preference for how the e-mail
        message content is to be handled by the Receiving Users. For this
        purpose semantics of sets of different character combinations
        ("Privicons") are described. These can syntactically be integrated
        either in the first-line of the body, in the subject line and/or in a
        dedicated header of any e-mail message. The Privicons icon set has 6
        different icons. They'll be machine readable.</t>

        <t>Importantly, all requests transmitted by Privicons can be
        overridden by the user: The approach is grounded in reminder over
        hard-coded solutions that indiscriminately restrict speech. So the
        icons are merely asking the Receiving User of an e-mail to follow the
        Sending User's preference. Other than DRM oriented approaches,
        Privicons embraces the concept of code-based norms approach. This
        means, that the approach relies on social norms to be followed by the
        Receiving User, rather than technical enforcement mechanisms. However,
        technical means may be used to support this (for an example
        specifications see <xref target="implementation">example e-mail
        message</xref>).</t>

        <t>Note: The specific character combinations for each Privicon is
        currently undergoing user testing, it therefore might and will most
        certainly change during the progression of this draft.</t>

      <section title="Relations to other standards">
        <t>This specification extends <xref target="RFC5322"></xref> -
        Internet Message Format by defining certain syntax for the
        first-line(s) of the body, the subject line and an additional header
        field.</t>

      <section title="Terminology and Conventions">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"></xref>. <list style="symbols">
            <t>The term "User Agent" (often also Mail User Agent, UA, MUA) is

            <t>The terms "Sending User" and "Receiving User" are related to a
            user using the User Agent either sending or receiving an e-mail
            message. A Sending User is a user that sends an e-mail message to
            a Receiving User. A Receiving User is a user that receives an
            e-mail message from a Sending User.</t>

            <t>The term "Line" is used as defined by SMTP Section-2.3.8 in
            <xref target="RFC5322"></xref> thereof</t>

            <t>The term "full-date" is used as defined by Section-5.6 in <xref
            target="RFC3339"></xref> in clause 5.6.</t>

            <t>The term Privacy Preference describes the intention the user
            had when she has sended a specific e-mail message. It can be
            expressed with the Privicons described in this RFC.</t>
