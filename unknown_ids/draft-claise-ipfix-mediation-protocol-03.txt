     1. Introduction 

        The IPFIX architectural components in [RFC5470] consist of 
        IPFIX Devices and IPFIX Collectors communicating using the 
        IPFIX protocol [RFC5101], which specifies how to export IP 
        Flow information.  This protocol is designed to export 
        information about IP traffic Flows and related measurement 
        data, where a Flow is defined by a set of key attributes 
        (e.g. source and destination IP address, source and 
        destination port, etc.).  
         
        However, thanks to its Template mechanism, the IPFIX protocol 
        can export any type of information, as long as the relevant 
        Information Element is specified in the IPFIX Information 
        Model [RFC5102], registered with IANA, or specified as an 
        enterprise-specific Information Element.  The specifications 
        in the IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] have not been defined in the 
        context of an IPFIX Mediator receiving, aggregating, 
        correlating, anonymizing, etc... Flow Records from the one or 
        multiple Exporters.  Indeed, the IPFIX protocol must be 
        adapted for Intermediate Processes, as defined in the IPFIX 
        Mediation Reference Model as specified in the Figure A of 
        [IPFIX-MED-FMWK], which is based on the IPFIX Mediation 
        Problem Statement [RFC5982]. 
         
        This document specifies the IP Flow Information Export 
        (IPFIX) protocol in the context of the implementation and 
        deployment of IPFIX Mediators.  The use of the IPFIX 
        protocol within a Mediator -- a device which contains both 
        as an Exporting Process and a Collecting Process -- has an 
        impact on the technical details of the usage of the 
        protocol.  An overview of the technical problem is covered 
        in section 6 of the [RFC5982]: loss of original exporter 
        information, loss of base time information, transport 
        sessions management, loss of Options Template Information, 
        Template Id management, considerations for network topology, 
        and IPFIX Mediation interpretation, and considerations for 
        aggregation.

        The specifications in this document are based on the IPFIX 
        protocol specifications but adapted according to the IPFIX 
        Mediation Framework [IPFIX-MED-FMWK]. 
      
      
     1.1. IPFIX Documents Overview 

        The IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101] provides network administrators 
        with access to IP Flow information. 
         
        The architecture for the export of measured IP Flow 
        information out of an IPFIX Exporting Process to a Collecting 
        Process is defined in the IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470], per 
        the requirements defined in RFC 3917 [RFC3917]. 
         
        The IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470] specifies how IPFIX Data 
        Records and Templates are carried via a congestion-aware 
        transport protocol from IPFIX Exporting Processes to IPFIX 
        Collecting Processes. 
         
        IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX Information Elements, 
        their name, type and additional semantic information, as 
        specified in the IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102].   
         
        The IPFIX Applicability Statement [RFC5472] describes what 
        type of applications can use the IPFIX protocol and how they 
        can use the information provided.  It furthermore shows how 
        the IPFIX framework relates to other architectures and 
        frameworks.  
         
        "IPFIX Mediation: Problem Statement" [RFC5982], describing the 
        IPFIX Mediation applicability examples, along with some problems 
        that network administrators have been facing, is the basis for 
        the "IPFIX Mediation: Framework" [IPFIX-MED-FMWK].  This 
        framework details the IPFIX Mediation reference model and the 
        components of an IPFIX Mediator. 
              
      
     1.2. IPFIX Mediator Documents Overview 

        The "IPFIX Mediation: Problem Statement" [RFC5982] provides an 
        overview of the applicability of Mediators, and defines 
        requirements for Mediators in general terms.  This document is 
        of use largely to define the problems to be solved through the 
        deployment of IPFIX Mediators, and to provide scope to the role 
        of Mediators within an IPFIX collection infrastructure.

     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>  February 2011 
         

        The "IPFIX Mediation: Framework" [IPFIX-MED-FMWK] provides more 
        architectural details of the arrangement of Intermediate 
        Processes within a Mediator. 
      
        The details of specific Intermediate Processes, when these have 
        additional export specifications (e.g., metadata about the 
        intermediate processing conveyed through IPFIX Options 
        Templates), are each treated in their own document (e.g., the 
        "IP Flow Anonymisation Support" [IPFIX-MED-ANON]).  Documents 
        specifying the operations of specific Intermediate Processes 
        cover the operation of these Processes within the Mediator 
        framework, and complying to the specifications given in this 
        document; they may additionally specify the operation of the 
        process independently, outside the context of a Mediator, when 
        this is appropriate.  As of today, these documents are:  
         
        1. "IP Flow Anonymisation Support", [IPFIX-MED-ANON], which 
        describes anonymisation techniques for IP flow data and the 
        export of anonymised data using the IPFIX protocol.  
         
        2. "Flow Selection Techniques" [IPFIX-MED-FLOWSEL], which 
        described the process of selecting a subset of flows from all 
        flows observed at an observation point, along with the 
        motivations, and some specific flow selection techniques. 
         
        3. "Exporting Aggregated Flow Data using the IP Flow Information 
        Export" [IPFIX-MED-AGGR] which describes Aggregated Flow export 
        within the framework of IPFIX Mediators and defines an 
        interoperable, implementation-independent method for Aggregated 
        Flow export. 
         
     1.3. Relationship with IPFIX and PSAMP 

        The specification in this document applies to the IPFIX 
        protocol specifications [RFC5101].  All specifications from 
        [RFC5101] apply unless specified otherwise in this document. 
      
        As the Packet Sampling (PSAMP) protocol specifications 
        [RFC5476] are based on the IPFIX protocol specifications, the 
        specifications in this document are also valid for the PSAMP 
        protocol.  Therefore, the method specified by this document 
        also applies to PSAMP.

     2. Terminology 

        The IPFIX-specific terms, such as Observation Domain, Flow, Flow 
        Key, Metering Process, Exporting Process, Exporter, IPFIX 
        Device, Collecting Process, Collector, Template, IPFIX Message, 
        Message Header, Template Record, Data Record, Options Template 
        Record, Set, Data Set, Information Element, and Transport 
        Session, used in this document are defined in [RFC5101].  
        The PSAMP-specific terms used in this document, such as 
        Filtering and Sampling are defined in [RFC5476].  
         
        The IPFIX Mediation terms related to the aggregation, such as 
        the Interval, Aggregated Flow, and Aggregated Fonction are 
        defined in [IPFIX-MED-AGGR]. 
         
        The IPFIX Mediation-specific terminology used in this document 
        is defined in "IPFIX Mediation: Problem Statement" [RFC5982], 
        and reuse in "IPFIX Mediation: Framework" [IPFIX-MED-FMWK].  
        However, since those two documents are an informational RFC, the 
        definitions have been reproduced here along with additional 
        definitions.   
         
        Similarly, since the [IPFIX-MED-ANON] is an experimental RFC, 
        the Anonymisation Record, Anonymised Data Record, and 
        Intermediate Anonymisation Process terms, specified in [IPFIX-
        MED-ANON], are also reproduced here. 
      
        In this document, as in [RFC5101], [RFC5476], [IPFIX-MED-AGGR , 
        and [IPFIX-MED-ANON], the first letter of each IPFIX-specific 
        and PSAMP-specific term is capitalized along with the IPFIX 
        Mediation-specific term defined here.  In this document, we call 
        "record stream" a stream of records carrying flow- or packet-
        based information.  The records may be encoded as IPFIX Data 
        Records in any other format. 
         
        Transport Session Information 
         
         The Transport Session is specified in [RFC5101].  In SCTP, the 
         Transport Session Information is the SCTP association.  In TCP 
         and UDP, the Transport Session Information corresponds to a 5-
         tuple {Exporter IP address, Collector IP address, Exporter 
         transport port, Collector transport port, transport protocol}. 
         
        Original Exporter 
         
          An Original Exporter is an IPFIX Device that hosts the  
          Observation Points where the metered IP packets are observed.

        Original Observation Point 
         
           An Observation Point of the Original Exporter(s).  In the 
         case of the Intermediate Aggregation Process on an IPFIX 
         Mediator, the Original Observation Point can be composed of a 
         (set of) specific exporter(s), a (set of) specific 
         interface(s) on an Exporter, a (set of) line card(s) on an 
         Exporter, or any combinations of these. 
      
        IPFIX Mediation 
         
          IPFIX Mediation is the manipulation and conversion of a record 
          stream for subsequent export using the IPFIX protocol. 
         
        The following terms are used in this document to describe the 
        architectural entities used by IPFIX Mediation. 
         
        Intermediate Process 
         
          An Intermediate Process takes a record stream as its input 
          from Collecting Processes, Metering Processes, IPFIX File 
          Readers, other Intermediate Processes, or other record 
          sources; performs some transformations on this stream, based 
          upon the content of each record, states maintained across 
          multiple records, or other data sources; and passes the 
          transformed record stream as its output to Exporting 
          Processes, IPFIX File Writers, or other Intermediate 
          Processes, in order to perform IPFIX Mediation. Typically, an 
          Intermediate Process is hosted by an IPFIX Mediator. 
          Alternatively, an Intermediate Process may be hosted by an 
          Original Exporter. 
         
        Specific Intermediate Processes are described below.  However, 
        this is not an exhaustive list. 
         
        Intermediate Conversion Process 
         
          An Intermediate Conversion Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that transforms non-IPFIX into IPFIX, or manages the relation 
          among Templates and states of incoming/outgoing Transport 
          Sessions (or equivalent for non IPFIX protocols) in the case 
          of transport protocol conversion (e.g., from UDP to SCTP). 
         
        Intermediate Aggregation Process 
         

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires August 14, 2010           [Page 7] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>  February 2011 
         

          An Intermediate Aggregation Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that aggregates records based upon a set of Flow Keys or 
          functions applied to fields from the record (e.g., binning and 
          subnet aggregation). 
         
        Intermediate Correlation Process 
         
          An Intermediate Correlation Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that adds information to records, noting correlations among 
          them, or generates new records with correlated data from 
          multiple records (e.g., the production of bidirectional flow 
          records from unidirectional flow records). 
         
        Intermediate Selection Process 
         
          An Intermediate Selection Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that selects records from a sequence based upon criteria-
          evaluated record values and passes only those records that 
          match the criteria (e.g., Filtering only records from a given 
          network to a given Collector). 
         
        Intermediate Anonymization Process 
         
          An Intermediate Anonymization Process is an Intermediate 
          Process that transforms records in order to anonymize them, to 
          protect the identity of the entities described by the records 
          (e.g., by applying prefix-preserving pseudonymization of IP 
          addresses). 
         
        IPFIX Mediator 
         
          An IPFIX Mediator is an IPFIX Device that provides IPFIX 
          Mediation by receiving a record stream from some data sources, 
          hosting one or more Intermediate Processes to transform that 
          stream, and exporting the transformed record stream into IPFIX 
          Messages via an Exporting Process.  In the common case, an 
          IPFIX Mediator receives a record stream from a Collecting 
          Process, but it could also receive a record stream from data 
          sources not encoded using IPFIX, e.g., in the case of 
          conversion from the NetFlow V9 protocol [RFC3954] to IPFIX

        Template Mapping 
         
         A mapping from Template Records and/or Options Template 
         Records received by a Mediator to Template Records and/or 
         Options Template Records sent by that IPFIX Mediator.  Each

         entry in a Template Mapping is scoped by incoming or outgoing 
         Transport Session and Observation Domain, as with Templates 
         and Options Templates in the IPFIX Protocol. 
           
        Anonymisation Record    
         
         A record, defined by the Anonymisation Options Template in 
         section Section 6.1, that defines the properties of the 
         anonymisation applied to a single Information Element within a 
         single Template or Options Template. 
         
        Anonymised Data Record    
         
         A Data Record within a Data Set containing at least one 
         Information Element with anonymised values.  The Information 
         Element(s) within the Template or Options Template describing 
         this Data Record SHOULD have a corresponding Anonymisation 
         Record. 
         
        Intermediate Anonymisation Process 
         
          An intermediate process which takes Data Records and and 
          transforms them into Anonymised Data Records. 
      
      
     3. Specifications 

        This section describes the IPFIX specifications for Mediation:   
        more specifically,  specifications for generic Intermediate 
        Processes.  Possible specific Intermediate Processes are: 
        Intermediate Conversion Process, Intermediate Aggregation 
        Process, Intermediate Correlation Process, Intermediate 
        Selection Process, Intermediate Anonymization Process.  
         
        For a specific Intermediate Process, the specifications in the 
        following reference MUST be followed, on the top of the 
        specifications in this document: 
       - For the Intermediate Aggregation Process, the specifications 
          in [IPFIX-MED-AGGR] MUST be followed. 
       - For the Intermediate Selection Process, the specifications in 
          [IPFIX-MED-FLOWSEL] MUST be followed.  
           
       - For the Intermediate Anonymization Process, the specifications 
          in [IPFIX-MED-ANON] should be considered as guidelines as 
          [IPFIX-MED-ANON] is an experimental RFC. 
       Note that no specific document deals with the Intermediate 
       Conversion Process at the time of this publication.

        These new specifications, which are more specific compared to 
        [RFC5101], are described with the key words described in 
        [RFC2119].  
         
     3.1. Encoding of IPFIX Message Header 

        The format of the IPFIX Message Header is shown in Figure A. 
        Note that the format is similar to the IPFIX Message in 
        [RFC5101], but some field definitions (for the example, the 
        Export Time) have been updated in the context of the IPFIX 
        Mediator.

                Time in seconds since 0000 UTC Jan 1st 1970, at which 
                the IPFIX Message Header leaves the IPFIX Mediator.   

        Sequence Number 

                Incremental sequence counter modulo 2^32 of all IPFIX 
                Data Records sent on this PR-SCTP stream from the 
                current Observation Domain by the Exporting Process.  
                Check the specific meaning of this field in the sub-
                sections of section 10 when UDP or TCP is selected as 
                the transport protocol.  This value SHOULD be used by 
                the Collecting Process to identify whether any IPFIX 
                Data Records have been missed.  Template and Options 
                Template Records do not increase the Sequence Number. 
                 
        Observation Domain ID 

                A 32-bit identifier of the Observation Domain that is 
                locally unique to the Exporting Process.  The Exporting 
                Process uses the Observation Domain ID to uniquely 
                identify to the Collecting Process the Observation 
                Domain that metered the Flows.  It is RECOMMENDED that 
                this identifier is also unique per IPFIX 
                Device.  Collecting Processes SHOULD use the Transport 
                Session and the Observation Domain ID field to separate 
                different export streams originating from the same 
                Exporting Process.  The Observation Domain ID SHOULD be 
                0 when no specific Observation Domain ID is relevant for 
                the entire IPFIX Message.  For example, when exporting 
                the Exporting Process Statistics, or in case of 
                hierarchy of Collector when aggregated Data Records are 
                exported.   
                Note: the Observation Domain Management is discussed in 
                section 3.4.1.   
      

     3.2. Template Management 

     3.2.1. Template Management Without Template Records Change 

        The first case is a situation where the IPFIX Mediator doesn't 
        modify the (Options) Template Record(s) content.  A typical 
        example is an Intermediate Selection Process acting as 
        distributor, which collects Flow Records from one or multiple 
        Exporters, and based on the Information Elements content, 
        redirects the Flow Records to the appropriate Collector.  This 
        example is a typical case of a single network operation center

        managing multiple universities: an unique IPFIX Collector 
        collects all Flow Records for the common infrastructure, but 
        might be re-exporting specific university Flow Records to the 
        responsible system administrator. 
         
        As specified in [RFC5101], the Template IDs are unique per 
        Exporter, per Transport Session, and per Observation Domain.  As 
        there is no guarantee that, for similar Template Records, the 
        Template IDs received on the incoming Transport Session and 
        exported to the outgoing Transport Session would be same, the 
        IPFIX Mediator MUST maintain a Template Mapping composed of 
        similar received and exported (Options) Template Records: 
       - for each received (Options) Template Record: Template Record 
          Flow Keys and non Flow Keys, Template ID, Observation Domain 
          Id, and Transport Session 
       - for each exported (Options) Template Record: Template Record 
          Flow Keys and non Flow Keys, Template ID, Collector, 
          Observation Domain Id, and Transport Session 
         
        If an IPFIX Mediator receives an IPFIX Withdrawal Message for a 
        (Options) Template Record that is not used anymore in any 
        outgoing Transport Sessions, the IPFIX Mediator SHOULD export 
        the appropriate IPFIX Withdrawal Message(s) on the outgoing 
        Transport Session, and remove the corresponding entry in the 
        Template Mapping. 
         
        If a (Options) Template Record is not used anymore in an 
        outgoing Transport Session, it MUST be withdrawn with an IPFIX 
        Template Withdrawal Message on that specific outgoing Transport 
        Session, and its entry MUST be removed from the Template 
        Mapping. 
         
         
        If an incoming or outgoing Transport Session is gracefully 
        shutdown or reset, the (Options) Template Records corresponding 
        to that Transport Session MUST be removed from the Template 
        Mapping.  
         
        Figure B displays an example of an Intermediate Selection 
        Process, re-distributing Data Records to Collectors on the basis 
        of the customer networks, i.e. the Route Distinguisher (RD).  In 
        this example, the Template Record received from the Exporter#1 
        is reused towards the Collector#1, Collector#2, and Collector#3.

     3.2.2. Template Management With New Template Records  

        The second case is a situation where the IPFIX Mediator 
        generates new (Options) Template Records compared to the 
        received ones. 
         
        In such a situation, the IPFIX Mediator doesn't need to maintain 
        a Template Mapping, as it generates its own series of (Options) 
        Template Records.  However, the following special case might 
        still require a Template Mapping, i.e. a situation where the 
        IPFIX Mediator, typically containing an Intermediate Conversion 
        Process, Intermediate Aggregation Process [IPFIX-MED-AGGR], or 
        Intermediate Anonymization Process in case of black-marker 
        anonymisation [IPFIX-MED-ANON], generates new (Options) Template 
        Records based on what it receives from the Exporter(s), and 
        based on the Intermediate Process function.  In such a case, 
        it's interesting to keep the correlation between the received 
        (Options) Template Records and exported Derived Options) 
        Template Records in the Template Mapping.  
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires August 14, 2010          [Page 14] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>  February 2011 
         

         
        Therefore, the IPFIX Mediator MAY maintain a Template Mapping  
        composed of received (Options) Template Records and exported 
        derived Options) Template Records: 
       - for each received (Options) Template Record: Template Record 
          Flow Keys and non Flow Keys, Template ID, Observation Domain, 
          and Transport Session 
       - for each exported derived Options) Template Record: Template 
          Record Flow Keys and non Flow Keys, Template ID, Collector, 
          Observation Domain, and Transport Session 
        
       If an IPFIX Mediator receives an IPFIX Withdrawal Message for a 
       (Options) Template Record that is not used anymore as the basis 
       of an inferred (Options) Template Records, the IPFIX Mediator 
       SHOULD export the appropriate IPFIX Withdrawal Message(s) for 
       the inferred (Options) Template Record on the outgoing Transport 
       Session, and remove the corresponding entry in the Template 
       Mapping. 
        
       The following two examples illustrate this.  
        
       First, consider an IPFIX Mediator hosting an Intermediate 
       Aggregation Process that generates time-series traffic octet 
       counts per source IP address (as in the example in section 8.1 
       of [IPFIX-MED-AGGR]).  Here, the Intermediate Process accepts 
       Flow Records fitting any Template, discards all Information 
       Elements other than the sourceIPv[46]Address and 
       octetDeltaCount, aggregates these across all original Exporters 
       in a given regular time interval, and exports Flow Records 
       according to a Template Record containing 
       flowStartTimeMilliseconds, flowEndTimeMilliseconds, 
       sourceIPv[46]Address, and octetDeltaCount. 
        
       In this case, no Template Mapping is necessary.  New Templates 
       and Template Withdrawals in the Transport Sessions from the 
       Original Exporters are handled as they would be at any 
       Collecting Process.  Records according to Templates which do not 
       contain at least a timestamp, sourceIPv[46]Address, and 
       octetDeltaCount IE are simply discarded by the Collector. 
        
       Next, consider a more generic case of this Intermediate 
       Aggregation Process, which creates time-series aggregates across 
       all Original Exporters, imposing a time interval but keeping a 
       subset of the incoming Flow Key received from the Original 
       Exporter.  In this case, a Template Mapping is necessary, as 
       there is a relationship between incoming and outgoing Templates.

             Figure C: Intermediate Aggregation Process Example 
      
       In Figure C, above, the Mediator accepts a Template Record 
       containing only the sourceIPv4Address as the Flow Key from 
       Exporters 1 and 2, and a Template Record containing only the 
       destinationIPv4Address as the Flow Key from exporter 3.  It 
       exports time-series source aggregates as Template ID 256, and 
       time-series destination aggregates as Template ID 257. The 
       Template Entries in this case are as follows:

     3.3. Time Management 

        The IPFIX Message Header "Export Time" field is the time in 
        seconds since 0000 UTC Jan 1, 1970, at which the IPFIX Message 
        Header leaves the IPFIX Mediator.  However, in the specific case 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires August 14, 2010          [Page 17] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>  February 2011 
         

        of an IPFIX Mediator containing an Intermediate Conversion 
        Process, the IPFIX Mediator MAY keep the export time received 
        from the incoming Transport Session. 
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that Mediators handle time using absolute 
        timestamps (e.g. flowStartSeconds, flowStartMilliseconds, 
        flowStartNanoseconds), which are specified relative to the UNIX 
        epoch (00:00 UTC 1 Jan 1970), where possible, rather than 
        relative timestamps (e.g. flowStartSysUpTime, 
        flowStartDeltaMicroseconds), which are specified relative to 
        protocol structures such as system initialization or message 
        export time.   
         
        The latter are difficult to manage for two reasons.  First, they 
        require constant translation, as the system initialization time 
        of an intermediate system and the export time of an intermediate 
        message will change across mediation operations.  Further, 
        relative timestamps introduce range problems.  For example, when 
        using the flowStartDeltaMicroseconds and 
        flowEndDeltaMicroseconds Information Elements [RFC5102], the 
        Data Record must be exported within a maximum of 71 minutes 
        after its creation.  Otherwise, the 32-bit counter would not be 
        sufficient to contain the flow start time offset.  Those time 
        constraints might be incompatible with some of the Intermediate 
        Processes: Intermediate Aggregation Process (temporal) and 
        Intermediate Correlation Process, for example. 
         
        When an Intermediate Aggregation Process aggregates information 
        from different Flow Records, the typical reporting times SHOULD 
        BE the minimum of the start times and the maximum of the end 
        times.  However, if the Flow Records do not overlap, i.e. if 
        there is a time gap between the times in the Flow Records, then 
        the report may be inaccurate.  The IPFIX Mediator is only 
        reporting what it knows, on the basis of the information made 
        available to it - and there may not have been any data to 
        observe during the gap.  Then again, if there is an overlap in 
        timestamps, there's the potential of double-accounting: 
        different Observation Points may have observed the same traffic 
        simultaneously.  Therefore, as there is not a single rule that 
        fits all different situations, the precise rules of applying the 
        Flow Record timestamps in IPFIX Mediators is out of the scope of 
        this document.  However, some more specifications related to the 
        specific case of aggregation in space and time are specified in 
        [IPFIX-MED-AGGR], and MUST be followed.

     3.4. Observation Point Management 

        Depending on the use case, top Collectors may need to receive 
        the Original Observation Point(s), otherwise it may wrongly 
        conclude that the IPFIX Device exporting the Flow Records to 
        him, i.e. the IPFIX Mediator, directly observed the packets that 
        generated the Flow Records.  Two new Information Element are 
        introduced to solve this use case: originalExporterIPv4Address 
        and originalExporterIPv6Address. 
         
        In the IPFIX Mediator, the Observation Point(s) may be 
        represented by:  
       - A single Original Exporter (represented by the 
          originalExporterIPv4Address or originalExporterIPv6Address 
          Information Elements) 
       - A list of Original Exporter (represented by the 
          originalExporterIPv4Address or originalExporterIPv6Address 
          Information Elements_) 
       - A list of Original Exporter (represented by the 
          originalExporterIPv4Address or originalExporterIPv6Address 
          Information Elements), along with the associated interface 
          (represented by the ingressInterface and/or egressInterface)  
       - A list of Original Exporter (represented by the 
          originalExporterIPv4Address or originalExporterIPv6Address 
          Information Elements), along with the associated line card id 
          (represented by the lineCardId)  
       - Any combination or list of Information Elements representing 
          Observation Points.  
        
        Some Information Elements characterizing the Observation Point 
        may be added.  For example, the flowDirection Information 
        Element specifies the direction of the observation, and, as 
        such, characterizes the Observation Point. 
      
        Any combination of the above examples is possible.  For example, 
        in case of an Intermediate Aggregation Process, an Original 
        Observation Point can be composed of: 
              exporterIPv4Address 192.0.2.1  
              exporterIPv4Address 192.0.2.2,  
                       interface ethernet 0, direction ingress 
                       interface ethernet 1, direction ingress 
                       interface serial 1, direction egress 
                       interface serial 2, direction egress 
              exporterIPv4Address 192.0.2.3,  
                       lineCardId 1, direction ingress 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires August 14, 2010          [Page 19] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>  February 2011 
         

      
        If the Original Observation Point is composed of a list, then 
        the IPFIX Structured Data [IPFIX-STRUCT] MUST be used to export 
        it from the IPFIX Mediator.   
         
        The most generic way to export the Original Observation Point is 
        to use a subTemplateMultiList, with the semantic "exactlyOneOf".  
        Taking back the previous example, the following encoding can be 
        used: 
         
                 Template Record 257: exporterIPv4Address 
                 Template Record 258: exporterIPv4Address, basicList of 
                                    ingressInterface, flowDirecdtion 
                 Template Record 259: exporterIPv4Address, lineCardId,  
                                    flowDirection 
         
        The Original Observation Point is modeled with the Data Records 
        corresponding to either Template Record 1, Template Record 2, or 
        Template Record 3 but not more than one of these ("exactlyOneOf" 
        semantic).  This implies that the Flow was observed at exactly 
        one of the Observation Points reported. 
         
        When an IPFIX Mediator receives Flow Records containing the 
        Original Observation Point Information Element, i.e. 
        originalExporterIPv6Address or originalExporterIPv4Address, the 
        IPFIX Mediator SHOULD NOT modify its value(s) when composing new 
        Flow Records in the general case.   Known exceptions include 
        anonymization per [IPFIX-MED-ANON] section 7.2.4 and an 
        Intermediate Correlation Process rewriting addresses across NAT.  
         
        In other words, the Original Observation Point should not be 
        replaced the IPFIX Mediator Observation Point.  The daisy chain 
        of (Exporter, Observation Point) representing the path the Flow 
        Records took from the Exporter to the top Collector, via the 
        IPFIX Mediator(s) is out of the scope of this specification.   
         
         

     3.4.1. Observation Domain Management 

        In any case, the Observation Domain ID of any IPFIX Message 
        containing Flow Records relevant to no particular Observation 
        Domain, or to multiple Observation Domains, MUST have an 
        Observation Domain ID of 0, as in section 3.1 above, and section 
        3.1 of [RFC5101]. 
         

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires August 14, 2010          [Page 20] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>  February 2011 
         

        IPFIX Mediators that do not change (Options) Template Records 
        MUST maintain a Template Mapping, as detailed in section 3.2.1, 
        to ensure that the combination of Observation Domain IDs and 
        Template IDs do not collide on export. 
         
        For IPFIX Mediators that export New (Options) Template Records 
        unchanged, as in section 3.2.2, there are two options for 
        Observation Domain ID management.  The first and simplest of 
        these is to completely decouple exported Observation Domain IDs 
        from received Observation Domain IDs; the IPFIX Mediator, in 
        this case, comprises its own set of Observation Domain(s) 
        independent of the Observation Domain(s) of the Original 
        Exporters. 
         
        The second option is to provide or maintain a Template Mapping 
        for received (Options) Template Records and exported inferred 
        (Options) Template Records, along with the appropriate 
        Observation Domain IDs per Transport Session, which ensures that 
        the combination of Observation Domain IDs and Template IDs do 
        not collide on export.   
      
        In some cases where the IPFIX Message Header can't contain a 
        consistent Observation Domain for the entire IPFIX Message, but 
        the Flow Records exported from the IPFIX Mediator should anyway 
        contain the Observation Domain of the Original Exporter, the 
        (Options) Template Record must contain the 
        originalObservationDomainId Information Element.  When an IPFIX 
        Mediator receives Flow Records containing the 
        originalObservationDomainId Information Element, the IPFIX 
        Mediator MUST NOT modify its value(s) when composing new Flow 
        Records with the originalObservationDomainId Information  
        Element. 
         
         
         
         

     3.5. Specific Reporting Requirements 

        Some specific Options Templates and Options Template Records are 
        necessary to provide extra information about the Flow Records 
        and about the Metering Process. 
         
        The Options Template Records defined in these subsections, which 
        impose some constraints on the Metering Process and Exporting 
        Process implementations in Intermediate Processes, MAY be 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires August 14, 2010          [Page 21] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>  February 2011 
         

        implemented.  If implemented, the specific Option Templates 
        SHOULD be implemented as specified in these subsections. 
         
        The minimum set of Information Elements is always specified in 
        these Specific IPFIX Options Templates.  Nevertheless, extra 
        Information Elements may be used in these specific Options 
        Templates. 
         

     3.5.1. The Flow Keys Options Template 

        Exactly like the IPFIX protocol [RFC5101], the Flow Keys Option 
        Template specifies the structure of a Data Record for reporting 
        the Flow Keys of reported Flows.  A Flow Keys Data Record 
        extends a particular Template Record that is referenced by its 
        templateId identifier.  The Template Record is extended by 
        specifying which of the Information Elements contained in the 
        corresponding Data Records describe Flow properties that serve 
        as Flow Keys of the reported Flow. 
         
        The Flow Keys Option Template SHOULD contain the following

        When any Intermediate Process changes the Flow Keys, the Flow 
        Keys Option Template MUST include the new set of Flow Keys. 
        Typically, an Intermediate Aggregation Process keeps or reduces 
        the number of Flow Keys 
         
     3.5.2. IPFIX Protocol Options Template 

        The "Metering Process Statistics Options Template", "The 
        Metering Process Reliability Statistics Options Template", and 
        "The Exporting Process Reliability Statistics Options Template", 
        as specified in [RFC5101], SHOULD be implemented on the IFPIX 
        Mediator. 
         
        Refer to the document specifying a particular Intermediate 
        Process type for specific values for these Options Template 
        Records.  For example, in case of an Intermediate Aggregation 
        Process, [IPFIX-MED-AGGR] must specify which values to insert 
        into the fields of "Metering Process Statistics Options 
        Template", "The Metering Process Reliability Statistics Options

        Template", and "The Exporting Process Reliability Statistics 
        Options Template" 
         
         
         
     3.5.3. IPFIX Mediator Options Template 

        There is no need for a specific Options Template for the IPFIX 
        Mediator; instead, each Intermediate Process type requires some 
        particular metadata.  For example, a specification of IPFIX flow 
        anonymisation including an Options Template for the export of 
        metadata about anonymised flows is described in [IPFIX-MED-
        ANON]; when anonymising Flows Records, IPFIX Mediators SHOULD 
        add the Options Template specified therein to annotate the 
        exported dataTransport Session Management 
        SCTP [RFC4960] using the PR-SCTP extension specified in 
        [RFC3758] MUST be implemented by all compliant IPFIX Mediator 
        implementations.  UDP [UDP] MAY also be implemented by compliant 
        IPFIX Mediator implementations.  TCP [TCP] MAY also be 
        implemented by IPFIX Mediator compliant implementations. 

        PR-SCTP SHOULD be used in deployments where IPFIX Mediators and 
        Collectors are communicating over links that are susceptible to 
        congestion.  PR-SCTP is capable of providing any required degree 
        of reliability. 

        TCP MAY be used in deployments where IPFIX Mediators and 
        Collectors communicate over links that are susceptible to 
        congestion, but PR-SCTP is preferred due to its ability to limit 
        back pressure on Exporters and its message versus stream 
        orientation.  

        UDP MAY be used, although it is not a congestion-aware protocol. 
        However, the IPFIX traffic between IPFIX Mediator and Collector 
        MUST run in an environment where IPFIX traffic has been 
        provisioned for, or is contained through some other means. 
         

     3.6. The Collecting Process's Side 

        An IPFIX Mediator MUST produce IPFIX Messages understandable by 
        a RFC5101-compliant IPFIX Collector, with the additional 
        specification in the IPFIX Structured Data [IPFIX-STRUCT]. 
         
        Therefore the Collecting Process on the top Collector MUST 
        support the IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] and the IPFIX Structured 
        Data [IPFIX-STRUCT].

     3.7. Configuration Management 

        In some cases such as an Intermediate Aggregation Process 
        aggregating Flow Records from multiple Original Exporters, a 
        consistent configuration of the Metering Processes and Exporting 
        Processes on these Original offers some advantages.  For 
        example, consistent active timeout, inactive timeout, and/or 
        consistent export time allows to compare the number of the Flow 
        Records per period of time.  For example, consistent Sampling 
        algorithm and parameters might allow to compare Flow Records 
        accuracy. 
         
        While this is tempting to include all configuration parameters 
        in Flow Records for the IPFIX Mediator to draw its own 
        conclusion, the consistency of the configuration should be 
        verified out of band, with the MIB modules ([RFC5815] and 
        [PSAMP-MIB] or with the Configuration Data Model for IPFIX and 
        PSAMP [IPFIX-CONF]

     5. Security Considerations 

        The same security considerations as for the IPFIX Protocol 
        [RFC5101] apply. 
         
        As they act as both IPFIX Collecting Processes and Exporting 
        Processes, the Security Considerations for IPFIX [RFC5101] apply 
        as well to Mediators.  The Security Considerations for IPFIX 
        Files [RFC5655] apply as well to IPFIX Mediators that write 
        IPFIX Files or use them for internal storage.  However, there 
        are a few specific considerations that IPFIX Mediator 
        implementations must take into account in addition. 
         
        By design, IPFIX Mediators are "men-in-the-middle": they 
        intercede in the communication between an Original Exporter (or 
        another upstream Mediator) and a downstream Collecting Process. 
        This has two important implications for the level of 
        confidentiality provided across an IPFIX Mediator, and the 
        ability to protect data integrity and Original Exporter 
        authenticity across a Mediator. These are addressed in more 
        detail in the Security Considerations for Mediators in [IPFIX-
        MED-FMWK]. 
         
        Note that, while Mediators can use the exporterCertificate and 
        collectorCertificate Information Elements defined in [RFC5655] 
        as described in section 9.3 of [IPFIX-MED-FMWK] to export

        information about X.509 identities in upstream TLS-protected 
        Transport Sessions, this mechanism cannot be used to provide 
        true end-to-end assertions about a chain of IPFIX Mediators: any 
        Mediator in the chain can simply falsify the information about 
        upstream Transport Sessions  In situations where information 
        about the chain of mediation is important, it must be determined 
        out of band. 

      
     6. IANA Considerations 

      This document specifies three new IPFIX Information Elements: the 
      applicationDescription, applicationTag and the applicationName. 
       
      New Information Elements to be added to the IPFIX Information 
      Element registry at [IANA-IPFIX] are listed below. 
       
      EDITOR'S NOTE: the XML specification in Appendix A must be updated 
      with the elementID values allocated, i.e. TBD1, TBD2, and TDB3, 
      must be replaced.
