Internet-Draft                PANA Key Wrap                  August 2011


1.  Introduction

   PANA [RFC5191] as a UDP-based protocol to perform EAP authentication
   between a PaC (PANA Client) and a PAA (PANA Authentication Agent).

   This document specifies an extension for PANA [RFC5191] to securely
   distribute keys from a PAA (PANA Authentication Agent) to a PaC (PANA
   Client) using a key wrap algorithm negotiated between the PAA and
   PaC.  A typical usage for this extension is group key distribution.
   For example, a ZigBee Network Key is a group key that is shared among
   members of a ZigBee network and used for bootstrapping IEEE 802.15.4
   link-layer ciphering between adjacent ZigBee nodes.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Basic Operation

   In the Authentication and Authorization phase, a PAA and a PaC
   negotiate on a key wrap algorithm.  A PAA that uses a key wrap AVP
   MUST include one or more Key-Wrap-Algorithm AVPs in the initial PANA-
   Auth-Request message with the 'S' (Start) bit set.  The PaC, if it
   supports a key wrap AVP, then selects one key wrap algorithm from
   these AVPs carried in the initial PANA-Auth-Request, and it responds
   with the initial PANA-Auth-Answer message carrying one Key-Wrap-
   Algorithm AVP for the selected algorithm.

   Upon successful PANA authentication, a key wrap AVP MAY be placed in
   the PAR message, which will have the header 'C' (Complete) bit set
   and contain a Result-Code AVP indicating PANA_SUCCESS.  A key wrap
   AVP MUST be of type OctetString, MUST contain exactly one key of a
   specific type, and MAY be defined as a standard or vendor-specific
   AVP.  A distinct AVP code MUST be defined for each key type.  The key
   data carried in the key wrap AVP is encrypted by a key encryption key
   (see Section 3) using the negotiated key wrap algorithm (see
   Section 4).

   When a key needs to be updated in the access phase a PANA ping
   exchange is used.  There are two modes for key update; pull mode and
   push mode.  In the pull mode, the PaC sends a PANA-Notification-
   Request message with the 'P' (Ping) bit set and the PAA responds with
   a PANA-Notification-Answer message with the 'P' (Ping) bit set and

   carrying a key wrap AVP if there is a new key.  In the push mode, the
   PAA sends a PANA-Notification-Request message with the 'P' (Ping) bit
   set and carrying a key wrap AVP to the PaC, and the PaC returns a
   PANA-Notification-Answer message with the 'P' (Ping) bit set to the
   PAA.


3.  Key Encryption Key

   PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY is used for encrypting a key to be delivered to the
   PaC.  PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY is derived from MSK as follows.

   PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY = the first N bits of
         prf+(MSK, "Key Encryption Key" | SID | KID)
         where | denotes concatenation.

   o  The prf+ function is defined in IKEv2 [RFC4306].  The pseudo-
      random function used for the prf+ function is specified in the
      PRF-Algorithm AVP carried in a PANA-Auth-Request message with 'S'
      (Start) bit set.

   o  N is the bit length of the PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY.  The value of N
      depends on the key wrap algorithm.  For AES Key Wrap with Padding
      algorithm, N=256.

   o  "Key Encryption Key" is the ASCII code representation of the non-
      NULL terminated string (excluding the double quotes around it).

   o  SID is a four-octet Session Identifier [RFC5191].

   o  KID is the content of the Key-ID AVP [RFC5191] associated with the
      MSK.


4.  Key-Wrap-Algorithm AVP

   The Key-Wrap-Algorithm AVP (AVP Code 12 (*needs IANA allocation*)) is
   used for conveying the identifier of a key wrap algorithm used for
   encrypting a key carried in a key wrap AVP.  The AVP data is of type
   Unsigned32.  The following key wrap algorithm identifiers are defined
   in this document.

   AES_KEY_WRAP_WITH_PADDING_256            1

      AES Key Wrap with Padding algorithm with a 256-bit key encryption
      key as specified in [RFC5649].

Internet-Draft                PANA Key Wrap                  August 2011


   AES_CCM                                  2

      AES-CCM (Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication
      Code) key wrap algorithm.  The formatting and counter generation
      function of AES-CCM as specified in Appendix A of [NIST_SP800_38C]
      is used, with the following parameters:

        n,  octet length of nonce, is 12.

        t,  octet length of MAC, is 16.

        q,  octet length of message length field, is 3.

      The 12-bit nonce is formed as 4-octet Session ID, followed by
      4-octet Key-Id, followed by 4-octet Sequence Number.  The Session
      ID and Sequence Number values must be the same as those in the
      PANA message carrying the key wrap AVP.  The Key-Id value must be
      the same as the one used for deriving the PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY.  The
      formatting function output blocks B0, B1, ..., Br are encoded as
      OctetString data in the Value field of a key wrap AVP, with no
      Associated Data.

   All PANA implementations that support this specification MUST support
   AES_KEY_WRAP_WITH_PADDING_256 [RFC5649].


5.  ZigBee-Network-Key AVP

   The ZigBee-Network-Key AVP (Vendor-Id 37244 (ZigBee Alliance, Inc),
   AVP Code 1) is a vendor-specific key wrap AVP of type OctetString,
   carrying encrypted 17-octet key data which consists of a 1-octet
   Network Key Sequence Number followed by a 16-octet Network Key used
   in the ZigBee IP network over which PANA is operating.


6.  Security Considerations

   Implementations must protect the PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY.  Implementations
   must not use the PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY for other purposes than wrapping
   keys in key wrap AVPs and must not use wrapped keys for other
   purposes than their intended usages.  Compromise of the
   PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY may result in the disclosure of all keys that have
   been wrapped with the PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY, which may lead to the
   compromise of all traffic protected with those wrapped keys.

   According to [RFC5649], the effective security provided to data
   protected with the wrapped key is determined by the weaker of the
   algorithm associated with the key encryption key and the algorithm

Internet-Draft                PANA Key Wrap                  August 2011


   associated with the wrapped key.  In this document, PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY
   is the key encryption key.  For ZigBee Network Key as the wrapped
   key, the length of the Network Key is 128 bits, therefore, with the
   PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY of at least 128 bits in length, at most 128 bits
   protection is provided to any data that depends on the Network Key.


7.  IANA Considerations

   As described in Section 4, and following the new IANA allocation
   policy on PANA AVPs [RFC5872], a standard AVP Code of 12 needs to be
   assigned for Key-Wrap-Algorithm AVP.

   Also, the key wrap algorithm identifier namespace for Key-Wrap-
   Algorithm AVP needs to be managed by IANA.  The value of 1
   (AES_KEY_WRAP_WITH_PADDING_256) and 2 (AES_CCM) are used in this
   document.  Allocating additional values can be done on IETF Review or
   IESG Approval [RFC5226].
