Internet-Draft    IPv4 Shortage: Needs and Open Issues        March 2009


1.  Introduction

   Taking into consideration the IPv4 public address pool currently
   available at the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), it is
   expected that the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) will have no
   more public IPv4 addresses to allocate in the short term.  At the
   time of writing, this anticipated date is mid-2012.  See the IPv4
   Address Report website www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html for a
   thorough analysis of this issue, and an updated prediction.

   At the exhaustion date, ISPs will wind up with public address pools
   that cannot grow.  They will have to make do with what they have
   currently got.  They will enter an IPv4 address shortage management
   phase.  It will not be possible to provide each customer with a
   unique public IPv4 address.  On the other hand, offering only an
   access to the IPv6 Internet won't be satisfactory for the customers
   because a lot of services will remain IPv4-only accessible (a full
   IPv6 world requires universal adoption which is hard to achieve).

   This document analyses the main issues related to IPv4 Internet
   access in the context of public IPv4 address exhaustion.


2.  Shared IPv4 Addresses

   So far, the current practice has been to give a unique IPv4 public
   address to each customer.  Current designs assume the allocation of a
   global IPv4 address to the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), whereas
   hosts connected to the CPE will be privately-addressed, meaning CPE
   devices activate a Network Address and Port Translator (NAPT)
   capability by default, sourcing IPv4 traffic based upon this sole
   global IPv4 address.  In this context, the addresses that can be seen
   in any IP packets always refer to a unique customer.  To cope with
   the IPv4 address exhaustion, this kind of practices is no more
   affordable.  Therefore ISPs are bound to allocate the same IPv4
   public address to several customers at the same time.

   All IPv4 address shortage mechanisms extend the address space in
   adding port information.  They differ on the way they manage the port
   value.  In this new context, an IPv4 address seen in an IP packet can
   refer to several customers.  The port information must be considered
   as well, in order to be able to unambiguously identify the customer
   pointed by that shared address.  In particular, the port information
   along with the address information, must eventually be taken into
   account by the routing infrastructure in order to correctly reach the
   intended destination.

   So far, two categories of solutions have been identified: (1)



Levis, et al.           Expires September 5, 2009               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    IPv4 Shortage: Needs and Open Issues        March 2009


   Solutions that propose the introduction of a NAPT function in the ISP
   network, denoted also as Carrier Grade NAT (CGN).  The CGN is
   responsible for translating IP packets issued with private addresses
   to ones with publicly routable IPv4 addresses. (2) Solutions that
   avoid the presence of a CGN function, they allocate the same IP
   public address to several customers at the same time.  They also
   allocate a restricted port range to each customer so that two
   customers with the same IP address have two different port ranges
   that do not overlap.


3.  Address Space Multiplicative Factor

   The purpose of sharing IPv4 addresses is to potentially increase the
   addressing space.  A key parameter is the factor by which ISPs want
   or need to multiply their IPv4 public address space; and the
   consequence is the number of customers sharing the same public IPv4
   address.

   The intention is not to replace IPv6.  However, we should be very
   careful; whatever the network model deployed, applications and
   business will run on top of it.  If we do not want to see IPv4
   shortage mechanisms postpone IPv6 deployment, all Internet actors
   must adopt a voluntary position towards IPv6.

   It is expected that IPv6 traffic will take an increasing part during
   the next years to come, at the expense of IPv4 traffic.  We should
   reach a safety point in the future, where the number of IPv4 public
   addresses, in use at the same time, begins decreasing.  From an ISP
   point of view, the multiplicative factor must be enough to survive
   until this occurs for its own customers.  Most likely, a one digit
   factor (less than 10) should be sufficient, and it should be
   pointless to go beyond.  Whereas the potential is huge, -if we allow
   to each customer (one IP address, 1000 ports) we multiply by 64 the
   total IPv4 address space- trying to devise solutions that can
   increase the IPv4 space by a significantly bigger factor might be
   seen as an incentive to postpone again and again IPv6 deployment.


4.  Service Management

   At the time of IPv4 address exhaustion in the RIRs, ISPs will have to
   manage public address pools that cannot grow (at least from the
   RIRs).  Concretely, they will have to decide to whom they allocate
   shared addresses and to whom they allocate unique addresses, to the
   extent of the availability of addresses.  Many policies can be
   envisaged, taking into account parameters such as: old vs. new
   customers, user profile, access type, geographic considerations,



Levis, et al.           Expires September 5, 2009               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    IPv4 Shortage: Needs and Open Issues        March 2009


   unique address as the privileged choice, shared address as the
   privileged choice, etc.  An important issue is whether shared and
   unique addresses will be differently charged.

   Care must be taken when considering the ratio that reflects the
   number of customers who will share a given global IPv4 address, not
   only to preserve some flexibility on the global address space that is
   left, but also to make sure that the ISP can adequately serve
   customer's requirements, without degrading the services they have
   subscribed to.  ISPs can adjust the volume of IPv4 public addresses
   available playing on the balance between shared and unique
   allocations.

   o  To increase the public IPv4 address pool: increase the number of
      customers with shared address; increase the ratio of customers per
      shared address.

   o  To decrease the public IPv4 address pool: decrease the number of
      customers with shared address; decrease the ratio of customers per
      shared address.


5.  IPv6 Migration and IPv4-IPv6 Coexistence

   Any IPv4 address shortage solution should make use, as much as
   possible, of the IPv6 transport capabilities available, in order to
   increase the IPv6 packets traffic and to move forward from an IPv4-
   enabled ISP network towards an almost only IPv6-enabled ISP network.
   If it is not the case, the risk is to delay IPv6 deployments, in
   staying on a pure dual-stack attitude for ever, similar to the ships
   in the night routing approach, where the protocols independently live
   their own lives.

   The IPv4 in IPv6 tunnels, and/or the translation NAT464 should be
   favored.  However, increasing the number of IPv6 packets does not
   automatically mean IPv6 is being generalized, if the main purpose of
   these packets is to carry IPv4 information.  This is very similar to
   what occurred with ATM, especially in European countries, where ATM
   cells have heavily been used to convey IPv4 packets in the backhaul
   networks, but have never been used for end-to-end communications.

   If the percentage of end-to-end IPv6 traffic significantly increases,
   so that the volume of IPv4 traffic begins decreasing, then the number
   of IPv4 sessions will be decreasing.  The smaller the number of
   current sessions per customer is, the higher the number of customers
   under the same IPv4 public address can be, and consequently, the
   lower the number of IPv4 public addresses is needed.  Hence, the
   pressure on IPv4 address shortage would be relaxed, because one IPv4



Levis, et al.           Expires September 5, 2009               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    IPv4 Shortage: Needs and Open Issues        March 2009


   public address would be able to potentially serve more customers.
   However, this effect will only occur for customers who have both an
   IPv6 access and a shared IPv4 access.  This would advocate the
   strategy to systematically bound a shared IPv4 access to any IPv6
   access.  Furthermore, some public IPv4 addresses will be required to
   connect IPv4 and IPv6 realms, through IPv4 IPv6 translators, for the
   sake of global reachability.


6.  Solution-Level Issues

   All IPv4 address shortage solutions will be confronted to the
   hereafter listed issues.  It is valuable to assess solutions with all
   these issues, to check to what degree they are concerned, how they
   handle each issue, and to what extent they resolve the pending
   problems.

6.1.  Network Addressing Capability

   The network addressing capability is the level of flexibility the
   network has to configure customers' devices, either with a unique
   address, or with a shared IPv4 address.  It can be assessed through
   the following considerations:

   o  Is it possible to configure any customer's device with a shared
      address, regardless his location and his history?

   o  Is it possible to configure any customer's device with a unique
      public address, regardless his location and his history?

   o  Is it straightforward to switch, for any customer, from a shared
      address to a unique public address, and vice versa?

   What is considered here is not the policy decision to allocate a
   unique or a shared address, but indeed the network capability to
   enforce such address management schemes.

6.2.  Number of Current Sessions per Customer

   In any kind of solutions, the number of current sessions per customer
   has, de facto, to be limited in some way.  Therefore, the number of
   current sessions per customer is a limit to take into account in any
   architectural dimensioning.  The degree of fairness -balanced
   distribution of sessions between customers-, should be assessed.
   Means to prevent against traffic loss (due to the limitation in
   number of sessions) should be evaluated and proposed.  The importance
   of this issue may be greatly reduced if the multiplicative factor is
   very small (e.g. 4).



Levis, et al.           Expires September 5, 2009               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    IPv4 Shortage: Needs and Open Issues        March 2009


   As for the current usage of ports, several hundreds per customer
   seems current practice, although several thousands may be not unusual
   with some P2P applications (e.g.  BitTorrent).

   The impact of the dynamicity of the sessions should also be
   considered, especially as far as performance is concerned.

6.3.  Scarcity of Private Addressing

   As a matter of fact, private IPv4 addresses (as defined in [RFC1918])
   belong to a finite space which may rapidly raise overlapping issues
   as both the number of customers and the number of services that can
   be subscribed by these customers increase.  As a consequence, some
   ISPs use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) such as [RFC4364] to allow
   reusing the same private addresses several times with no routing
   overlaps.  This brings a lot of complexity in network configuration
   and management.

   It has been suggested to make the 240/4 block available for private
   addressing [I-D.wilson-class-e].  This address block, formerly
   designated as "Class E", is still noted as being reserved in the IANA
   IPv4 address registry.  If it were reassigned for private addressing
   that would yield around 268 millions extra private addresses.
   However, many current implementations of the TCP/IP protocol stack do
   not allow the use of the 240/4 block.  This is a severe blocking
   point for a lot of existing devices: CPE, NAT or routers.  This issue
   will only be solved when the vendors' implementations accept the
   (240/4) addresses.

   Another suggestion [I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr] is to reserve some
   public blocks (typically three or four /8) only for internal usage.
   So far, there has been no consensus upon this proposal.

   What needs to be considered is to what extent the IPv4 sharing
   solutions make use of IPv4 private addresses.

6.4.  Scalability

   Any claimed solution to solve the IPv4 address shortage should be
   able to deliver the IP connectivity services to a large amount of
   customers, this limit should be evaluated.

6.5.  Impact on Information System

   The impact on the Information System platforms and applications
   handling the administrative and technical information to control the
   activation of services, and to manage the customer profiles, should
   be evaluated and assessed.



Levis, et al.           Expires September 5, 2009               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    IPv4 Shortage: Needs and Open Issues        March 2009


   Common practice used to rely upon the global IPv4 address assigned to
   a CPE device for customer identification purposes.  The forthcoming
   address depletion therefore encourages ISPs to revisit their customer
   identification schemes since global IPv4 addresses will be shared
   amongst several customers.  This clearly advocates for an IPv6-based
   customer identification scheme and thus impacts the way customer-
   specific management policies are enforced.

   The possibility to give either a unique or a shared address, coupled
   or not with an IPv6 address, could yield several types of customers
   to deal with in the IS: IPv4 unique only, IPv4 shared only, IPv4
   unique + IPv6, IPv4 shared + IPv6, IPv6 only.  The way the solution
   tries to possibly alleviate or simplify customer profile handling,
   should be evaluated and assessed.

6.6.  Impact on Services

   There is a potential danger for the following types of applications:

   o  Applications that establish inbound communications

   o  Applications that carry address information in their payload

   o  Applications that carry port information in their payload

   o  Applications that use fixed ports (e.g. well known)

   o  Applications that do not use any port (e.g.  ICMP)

   o  Applications that assume the uniqueness of customers' addresses
      (e.g.  IP address as identifier)

   o  Applications that explicitly prohibit twice the same address to
      access to a resource at the same time

   Current applications already implement some mechanisms in order to
   circumvent the presence of NATs (typically CPE NATs):

   o  ALGs

   o  Port Forwarding

   o  UPnP IGD

   o  NAT Traversal

   It should be considered to what extent these mechanisms can still be
   used with IPv4 shortage mechanisms put in place.

Internet-Draft    IPv4 Shortage: Needs and Open Issues        March 2009


   Impact on existing services:

   o  Will this service work as usual?

   o  Will this service work but with a degradation?

   o  What level of degradation?

   o  Will this service not work at all?

   o  What modifications are needed if any?

   Impact on future services:

   o  What new constraints are to be taken into account to devise new
      services?

6.7.  Flow Discrimination

   The ISP can offer walled garden services along with Internet
   services.  The ISP may want these flows not to traverse the IPv4
   shortage facilities put in place (for instance, all the IPv4 traffic
   doesn't have to be processed by a CGN facility, for various reasons
   that are mostly ISP policy-specific and which include -but are not
   necessarily limited to- performance considerations, service-specific
   forwarding policies).  It should be clear how these IPv4 flows can
   bypass the IPv4 shortage facilities and how they can be handled by
   the corresponding service platform/gateway.  However, the best
   practice seems to rapidly migrate these services from IPv4 to IPv6.

6.8.  Impact on Intra-Domain and Inter-Domain Routing

   The introduction of port consideration to route packets to their
   final destinations may have an impact on the current routing
   infrastructure: on the architecture, the IGP and EGP configuration,
   the addressing configuration, and on routers performances.

   The introduction of new nodes that cannot be circumvent could also
   yield non optimized routes, especially for communications between
   customers attached to the same ISP realm.  It could also strongly
   modify the current flow distribution scheme among the different links
   and nodes.

6.9.  Fragmentation

   When a packet is fragmented, the port information (either UDP or TCP)
   will only be present in the first fragment.  The other fragments will
   not bear the port information which is necessary to a correct



Levis, et al.           Expires September 5, 2009              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft    IPv4 Shortage: Needs and Open Issues        March 2009


   treatment up to the destination.  Appropriate solutions should be
   evaluated.

6.10.  Impact on CPE

   IPv4 shortage mechanisms may require specific features in the CPEs.
   Some CPEs are ISP branded.  CPE devices are strategic not only
   because of their large number, but also because of the advanced
   capabilities they support, and which include (but are not limited
   to), firewalling, QoS and self-configuring abilities.  The impact on
   existing CPE devices should be carefully evaluated, taking into
   account: features needed, required modifications, availability.

   This issue is not specific to ISP branded CPEs.  CPE behavior should
   be particularly specified by any solution claiming to solve the IPv4
   address exhaustion problem.

6.11.  QoS

6.11.1.  QoS performance

   The possible degradation of end-to-end performances (e.g. delay)
   experienced in the context of IPv4 shortage solutions should be
   evaluated.

6.11.2.  QoS mechanisms

   The impact on QoS mechanisms should be investigated.  In particular
   the ability to classify traffic in order to apply differentiated
   treatments could be hindered by the fact that an IPv4 address is
   shared among several users, possibly in a dynamic way.

6.11.3.  Introduction of Single Point of Failure (Robustness)

   The introduction of new nodes/functions, specifically where the port
   information is managed, can create single points of failure.  Any
   IPv4 shortage solution should consider the opportunity to add
   redundancy features in order to alleviate the impact on the
   robustness of the IP connectivity service.

   Additionally, load balancing and load sharing means should be
   evaluated.  The ability of the solution to allow hot swapping from a
   machine to another, in minimizing the perturbations, should be
   considered.

Internet-Draft    IPv4 Shortage: Needs and Open Issues        March 2009


6.12.  Port Related Entries in the ISP Equipment

   Additional data related to port information should be stored and
   maintained by the ISP equipment.  As an example, a set of entries
   (e.g. session states, binding entries) are to be instantiated and
   maintained.  The amount of data to be stored, the way the entries are
   instantiated and managed, should be documented.

   The number of port related entries in the ISP equipment can have a
   significant impact on performance, scalability, and solution cost.

6.13.  Support of Multicast

   It should be assessed if a customer with a shared address can receive
   multicast packets and source multicast packets.

   Particularly, impact on IGMP should be identified and solutions
   proposed.  Because of the presence of several end user devices with
   the same IP address, membership to multicast groups should be
   evaluated and enhancement should be proposed if required.  Besides
   the membership issue, building multicast trees may be impacted.  This
   impact should be assessed and alternatives proposed.

6.14.  Mobile-IP

   Owing to the deployment of a Mobile-IP architecture, a mobile
   terminal continues to access its connectivity service when visiting a
   Foreign Network.  In order to avoid traffic loss, it is recommended
   to use the home address (HoA), and not the care-of address (CoA), to
   reach that mobile terminal.  A dedicated entity called HA (Home
   Agent) is responsible for routing the traffic according to the
   binding table it maintains.  This table includes in particular the
   association between the HoA and CoA.  A Foreign Agent (FA) can
   optionally be deployed in the visited network.  If an IP address is
   shared (in the home network or/and in the visited network), HA or FA
   must be updated so as to take into account the port information to
   achieve its operations (i.e. relay traffic destined to HoA to the
   current CoA).  The way proposed solutions deal with Mobile-IP
   mechanisms should be identified and assessed.

6.15.  End-Users Facilities

   In the current deployments, end-users are used to configuring their
   CPEs in order to control the traffic entering/exiting their home LAN.
   Examples of these facilities are: port forwarding or firewall rules.
   The availability of these facilities offer to the end-users should be
   considered in the context of IPv4 address exhaustion solutions.
   Degradation compared to the current practice should be assessed.

6.16.  Management Tools

   ISPs deploy a set of tools and applications for the management of
   their infrastructure, especially for supervision purposes.  Impact on
   these tools should be evaluated and solutions proposed when required.
   Particularly, means to assign IP connectivity information, means to
   monitor the overall network, to assess the reachability of devices
   should be specified.  In this context, impact on tools (e.g.  ICMP-
   based) to check the reachability of network nodes should be
   evaluated.

6.17.  Legal Obligations

   ISPs can be required by governmental and/or regulation authorities to
   provide customer-specific information upon request.

6.17.1.  Traceability

   Legal obligations require an ISP to provide the identity of a
   customer upon request of the authorities.  Because one public IPv4
   address may be shared between several users, the knowledge of the
   port number, along with the IP address, is mandatory to have a chance
   to find the appropriate user.  The ISP must be able to provide the
   identity of a customer from the knowledge of the IPv4 public address
   and the port number.

6.17.2.  Interception

   This process is proactive, a given group of communications is
   replicated in real time towards a law enforcement agency.  Typically,
   the point of replication is the first IP hop in the ISP network.
   Wiretapping techniques need to be transparent to the customer, so
   that the targeted customer cannot be aware of the interception.

6.18.  Security

6.18.1.  Port Randomization

   A kind of blind attacks that can be performed against TCP relies on
   the attacker's ability to guess the five-tuple (Protocol, Source
   Address, Destination Address, Source Port, Destination Port) that
   identifies the transport protocol instance to be attacked.  Document
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-port-randomization] describes a number of methods for
   the random selection of the client port number, such that the
   possibility of an attacker guessing the exact value is reduced.  With
   shared IPv4 addresses, the port selection space is reduced.
   Intuitively, assuming the port range is known, the smaller the port
   range is, the more predictable the port choice is.

   Any solution to solve IPv4 address shortage should specify how port
   randomization is impacted and what alternative means to bypass the
   issue are.

6.18.2.  Duplicate Effects

   Some types of attacks that have an impact on a targeted IPv4 public
   address, could see their effects increased by the number of customers
   who share this address.  For example, if a given address that has,
   deliberately or not misbehaved, is consequently forbidden to access
   some resources, the whole set of customers who share this address
   will be impacted.

6.18.3.  IPsec

   Even if IPSec is not deployed for mass market, impacts of solutions
   based on shared IP addresses should be evaluated and assessed.
   [RFC3947] proposes a solution to solve issues documented in
   [RFC3715].  The applicability of [RFC3947] in the context of shared
   IP address should be evaluated.
