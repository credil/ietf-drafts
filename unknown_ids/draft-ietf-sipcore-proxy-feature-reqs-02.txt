Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Caller Preferences" extension
   defined in RFC 3840 provides a mechanism that allows a SIP message to
   convey information relating to the originator's supported features/
   capabilities.  This document defines requirements for a mechanism
   that would allow SIP proxies to convey information relating to the
   proxy's supported features/capabilities.

Internet-Draft                proxy feature                 October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Caller Preferences" extension
   defined in RFC 3840 [RFC3840] provides a mechanism that allows a SIP
   message to convey information relating to the originator's supported
   features/capabilities.

   It can be useful for SIP proxies to indicate supported feature/
   capabilities, that might trigger actions and enable functions in
   other SIP entities.

   This document defines requirements for a mechanism that would allow
   SIP proxies to convey information related to the proxy's supported
   features/capabilities.

1.1.  Use-case: IMS Service Continuity, handover of session in alerting
      state

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines a IP Multimedia
   Subsystem (IMS) Service Continuity mechanism [3GPP.23.237] for
   handover of Packet Switched (PS) sessions to Circuit Switched (CS)
   calls.

   The handover is controlled by a Service Centralization and Continuity
   Application Server (SCC AS).  When a session is established the User
   Equipment (UE) needs to determine whether SCC AS in signalling path
   of the session supports handover of session in alerting state (i.e.
   180 Ringing response has already been sent or received but the dialog
   is not confirmed dialog yet) or not.

   When handover occurs and a session in alerting state exists and both
   UE and SCC AS indicated support of the handover of session in
   alerting state, then the UE and SCC AS perform handover for the
   session in alerting state.

   NOTE: The UE indicates the support of the handover of session in
   alerting state by the feature tag included in Contact header field.

1.2.  Use-case: IMS Enhanced Service Continuity

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines a IP Multimedia
   Subsystem (IMS) Service Continuity mechanism [3GPP.23.237] for
   handover of Packet Switched (PS) sessions to Circuit Switched (CS)
   calls.  The handover can be performed by a Service Centralization and
   Continuity Application Server (SCC AS), or by a SCC AS together with
   an Access Transfer Control Function (ATCF), that acts as a SIP proxy.
   Delegating part of the session handover functionality to an ATCF
   provides advantages related to voice interruption during session

   handover etc, since the ATCF is located in the same network as the
   user.

1.2.1.  Use-case: IMS Enhanced Service Continuity, ATCF discovery

   In order for an SCC AS to delegate part of the session handover
   functionality to an ATCF, when the SCC AS is informed by the
   registrar about an accepted REGISTER transaction, the SCC AS needs to
   determine whether a proxy supporting the ATCF functionality is in the
   registration path.

1.2.2.  Use-case: IMS Enhanced Service Continuity, identifying sessions
        subject to handover

   In order for ATCF to perform the delegated part of the session
   handover functionality, when a session is set up, the ATCF needs to
   determine whether a SIP proxy supporting the SCC AS functionality is
   in the signalling path of the session.

1.2.3.  Use-case: IMS Enhanced Service Continuity, indicating handover
        subfeature support

   As the session handover functionality has been specified over several
   3GPP releases, some subfeatures of the handover functionality are
   optional.  Examples are:

   - The handover of sessions with audio on hold (called the MSC server
   assisted mid-call feature); and

   - The handover of sessions where a 180 Ringing response to the
   initial SIP INVITE request has already been sent or received but a
   final response has not been sent or received yet (called the SRVCC
   for calls in alerting phase).

   The SCC AS needs to be aware of support of those subfeatures in ATCF,
   in order for the UE and the SCC AS to execute the correct handling
   when the handover occurs.

   When ATCF receives a SIP REGISTER request, the ATCF indicates the
   support of those subfeatures along the indication of ATCF
   functionality.

   When SCC AS is informed about the new/updated binding where a proxy
   indicated support of ATCF functionality along with support of those
   subfeatures, the SCC AS discovers the support of those subfeatures in
   the ATCF.

1.3.  Use-case: IMS Inter-UE Transfer

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines inter-UE
   transfer enhancements [3GPP.24.837] which enhance delivery of media
   of a session to several User Equipments (UE).

   The Service Centralization and Continuity Application Server (SCC AS)
   serving one of the UEs acts as local hub for the session.  The UE
   controls the media of the session and is called controller UE.

   Triggered by requests from the controller UE, the SCC AS serving the
   controller UE transfers media of the session to other UEs, called
   controlee UEs, by sending INVITE request offering the media to be
   transferred.

   When an INVITE request is routed to the UE, the SCC AS serving the UE
   needs to determine whether a SIP proxy supporting the inter-UE
   transfer enhancements functionality (i.e.  SCC AS of the controller
   UE) is already in the signalling path.

   If so, the SCC AS proxies the signalling without further handling as
   there is already an existing local hub for the session.

   If not, the SCC AS acts as local hub for the session.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements

   REQ-1: It MUST be possible for a SIP proxy to indicate, and convey to
   other SIP entities in the signalling path of a registration request,
   support of a particular feature/capability.

   REQ-2: It MUST be possible for a SIP proxy to indicate, and convey to
   other SIP entities in the signalling path of a dialog-forming
   request, support of a particular feature/capability.

   REQ-3: It MUST be possible for a SIP proxy to indicate that the
   indicated support of a feature/capability only applies to other SIP
   entities in the direction towards one of the SIP endpoints in the
   signalling path.

Internet-Draft                proxy feature                 October 2011


   REQ-4: A SIP proxy MUST NOT, when indicating support of a feature/
   capability, make any assumptions that SIP entities in the signalling
   path that receive the indicator will support, or understand the
   meaning of, the feature/capability, or even support the proxy
   feature/capability indication mechanism as a whole.

   REQ-5: A SIP proxy MUST be able to indicate support of a feature/
   capability to other SIP entities in the signaling path, even if some
   SIP entities in the signaling path (possibly including the UAC and/or
   UAS) do not support, or understand the meaning of, the feature/
   capability, or even support the proxy feature/capability indication
   mechanism as a whole.

   REQ-6: It MUST be possible to indicate whether indicated support of a
   feature/capability applies to specific registration, to a specific
   dialog, or to all dialogs created as part of INVITE transaction.

   NOTE: This requirement might be fully implemented as part of the
   protocol mechanism, or parts might be left to be specified in a
   feature/capability specification, or it might be left to be specified
   in a feature/capability specification completely.

   REQ-7: It MUST be possible to assign additional parameters (either as
   a single value, or a list of values) to a feature/capability
   indicator, in order to provide additional information about the
   feature/capability.

   REQ-8: If a SIP entity receives a feature support indication that it
   does not understand, it MUST act as if it hadn't received the
   indication.

   REQ-9: If a SIP entity that does not support the proxy feature/
   capability indication mechanism receives a feature support
   indication, it MUST act as if it hadn't received the indication.

   REQ-10: Other SIP entities MUST be able to make routing decisions
   based on received feature/capability support indications.

   REQ-11: A feature/capability support indicator MUST only be used to
   indicate support of a feature/capability, and MUST NOT be used to
   indicate whether procedures associated with the feature/capability
   have been applied or not.

   REQ-12: It MUST be possible to determine which features/capabilities
   are supported by the same proxy

   REQ-13: A procedure for registering feature/capability indication
   values with IANA MUST be defined.

4.  Security Considerations

   Feature/capability support indications can provide sensitive
   information about a SIP entity.  RFC 3840 cautions against providing
   sensitive information to another party.  Once this information is
   given out, any use may be made of it.


5.  IANA Considerations

   None identified.
