    <abstract>
      <t>In a large RTP session using the RTCP feedback mechanism defined in
      RFC 4585, a feedback target may experience transient overload if some
      event causes a large number of receivers to send feedback at once. This
      overload is usually avoided by ensuring that feedback reports are
      forwarded to all receivers, allowing them to avoid sending duplicate
      feedback reports. However, there are cases where it is not recommended
      to forward feedback reports, and this may allow feedback implosion. This
      memo discusses these cases and defines a new RTCP third-party loss
      report that can be used to inform receivers that the network is aware of
      some loss event, allowing them to suppress feedback. Associated SDP
      signalling is also defined.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>RTCP feedback messages <xref target="RFC4585"></xref> allow the
      receivers in an RTP session to report events and ask for action from the
      media source (or a delegated feedback target when using unicast RTCP
      feedback with SSM <xref target="RFC5760"></xref>). There are cases where
      multiple receivers may initiate the same, or an equivalent message
      towards the same media source. When the receiver count is large, this
      behavior may cause transient overload of the media source, the network
      or both. This is known as a "feedback storm" or a "NACK storm". One
      common cause of such a feedback storm is receivers utilizing RTP
      retransmission <xref target="RFC4588"></xref> as a packet loss recovery
      technique based, sending feedback using RTCP NACK messages <xref
      target="RFC4585"></xref> without proper dithering of the retransmission
      requests (e.g., implementing the RFC 4585 dithering rules or sending
      NACKs to a middlebox that doesn't redistribute them to other
      receivers).</t>

      <t>Another use case involves video Fast Update requests. A storm of
      these feedback messages can occur in conversational multimedia scenarios
      like multipoint video switching conference <xref
      target="RFC4587"></xref>. In this scenario, the receiver may lose
      synchronization with the video stream when speaker is changed in the
      middle of session. Poorly designed receivers that blindly issue fast
      update requests (i.e., Full Intra Request (FIR) described in <xref
      target="RFC5104"></xref>), can cause an implosion of FIR requests from
      receivers to the same media source.</t>

      <t>RTCP feedback storms may cause short term overload, and in extreme
      cases to pose a possible risk of increasing network congestion on the
      control channel (e.g. RTCP feedback), the data channel, or both. It is
      therefore desirable to provide a way of suppressing unneeded
      feedback.</t>

      <t>One approach to this, suggested in <xref target="DVB-IPTV"></xref>,
      involves sending a NACK message to the other clients (or receiver) in
      the same group as the sender of NACK. However NACK is defined as a
      receiver report sent from a receiver observing a packet loss, therefore
      it only inform others that sender of NACK detected loss while the case
      the sender of the feedback has received reports that the indicated
      packets were lost is not covered. This document specifies a new
      third-party loss report for this function. It supplements the existing
      the use of RTCP NACK packet and further is more precise in the uses
      where the network is active to suppress feedback. It tells receivers
      explicitly that feedback for a particular packet or frame loss is not
      needed for a period of time and can provide an early indication before
      the receiver reacts to the loss and invokes its packet loss repair
      machinery. Section 6 provides some examples of when to send the Third
      Party Loss Report message. <xref target="Use"></xref> provides some
      examples of when to send the Third Party Loss Report message.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol Overview">
      <t>This document extends the RTCP feedback messages defined in the
      Audio-Visual Profile with feedback (RTP/AVPF) <xref
      target="RFC4585"></xref> defining a Third Party Loss Report message. The
      Third Party Loss Report message can be used by the intermediaries to
      inform the receiver that the sender of the Third Party Loss Report has
      received reports that the indicated packets were lost, and asks the
      receiver not to send feedback to it regarding these packets.</t>

      <t>RTCP Third Party Loss Report follows the similar format of message
      type as RTCP NACK or Full Intra Request Command. However, the Third
      Party Loss Report is defined as an indication that the sender of the
      feedback has received reports that the indicated packets were lost,
      while NACK <xref target="RFC4585"></xref> just indicates that the sender
      of the NACK observed that these packets were lost. The Third Party Loss
      Report message is generated by a RTP system that has not seen the actual
      packet loss and sent following the same timing rule as sending NACK
      defined in <xref target="RFC4585"></xref>, e.g., The TPLR message may be
      sent in a regular full compound RTCP packet or in an early RTCP packet,
      as per AVPF. RTP Systems in the network that receive a Third Party Loss
      Report SHOULD NOT initiate their own additional Third Party Loss Report
      messages for the same packet sequence numbers. They should simply
      forward the Third Party Loss Report message received from upstream
      direction, additionally, they may generate their own Third Party Loss
      Report that reports a set of the losses they see, which are different
      from ones reported in the Third Party Loss report they received. The
      Third Party Loss Report does not have the retransmission request <xref
      target="RFC4588"></xref> semantics.</t>

      <t>When a receiver gets a Third Party Loss Report message, it should
      start a timer for this message and refrain from sending a feedback
      request (e.g., NACK or FIR) for the missing packets reported in the
      message during the lifetime of the timer. The timer value shall be based
      on the observed round-trip time. A receiver should compute an estimate
      of the round-trip time (RTT) to the sender of TPLR from RTCP report
      round-trip time if available, or its reception time of the reflected
      RTCP FB message (e.g.,NACK), or any other means.</t>

      <t>To increase the robustness to the loss of a TPLR or of a transmission
      packet, a receiver is allowed to receive additional TPLR for the same
      packet. In the case the first TPLR is lost and the additional TPLR
      arrives at the receiver, the receiver should immediately refresh the
      timer. When the timer for this message expires and there is no
      retransmitted packet or a new Third Party Loss Report message, the
      receiver should take its normal behavior as if there is no current
      retransmission suppression.</t>

      <t>A receiver may still have sent a Feedback message according to the
      RTP/AVPF scheduling algorithm of <xref target="RFC4585"></xref> before
      receiving a Third Party Loss Report message, but further feedback
      messages for those sequence numbers will be suppressed by this technique
      for a certain period of time. Nodes that do not understand the Third
      Party Loss Report message will ignore it, and might therefore still send
      feedback according to the AVPF scheduling algorithm of <xref
      target="RFC4585"></xref>. The media source or intermediate nodes cannot
      assume that the use of a Third Party Loss Report message actually
      reduces the amount of feedback it receives.</t>

      <t>Since Third Party Loss Report interacts strongly with repair timing,
      it has to work together with feedback to not adversely impact the repair
      of lost source packets. In order not to incur a lot of NACK requests due
      to additional TPLR described above, it is recommended that the RTP
      system sending TPLR should be implemented more closer to the source.
      Also when the loss was detected and repair initiated much closer to the
      source, the delay for the receiver to recover from packet loss can be
      reduced through the combination of intermediary feedback to the source
      and Third Party Loss Report downstream.</t>

    <section anchor="sec4" title="Format of RTCP Feedback Messages">
      <t>This document registers two new RTCP Feedback messages for Third
      Party Loss Report. Applications that are employing one or more loss-
      repair methods MAY use the Third Party Loss Report together with their
      existing loss-repair methods either for every packet they expect to
      receive, or for an application-specific subset of the RTP packets in a
      session. In other words, receivers MAY ignore Third Party Loss Report
      messages, but SHOULD react to them unless they have good reason to still
      send feedback messages despite having been requested to suppress
      them.</t>

    <section anchor="Use" title="Example Use Cases">
      <t>The operation of feedback suppression is similar for all types of RTP
      sessions and topologies <xref target="RFC5117"></xref>, however the
      exact messages used and the scenarios in which suppression is employed
      differ for various use cases. The following sections outline some of the
      intended use cases for using the Third Party Loss Report for feedback
      suppression and give an overview of the particular mechanisms.</t>

      <section title="Source Specific Multicast (SSM) use case">
        <t>In SSM RTP sessions as described in <xref target="RFC5760"></xref>,
        one or more Media Sources send RTP packets to a Distribution Source.
        The Distribution Source relays the RTP packets to the receivers using
        a source- specific multicast group.</t>

        <t>As outlined in the <xref target="RFC5760"></xref>, there are two
        Unicast Feedback models that may be used for reporting, the Simple
        Feedback model and the Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model. In
        the simple Feedback Model, there's no need for distribution source to
        create the Third Party Loss Report, instead, NACKs are reflected by
        the distribution source to the other Receivers. However in the
        Distribution Source Feedback Summary model, the distribution source
        will not redistribute the NACK for some reason(e.g., to prevent
        revealing the identity or existence of a system sending NACK)and may
        send a Third Party Loss Report to the systems that were unable to
        receive the NACK, and won't receive the NACK via other means. since
        the summary feedback does not mandate the forwarding of NACK
        downstream. The Third Party Loss Report can be generated at the
        distribution source when downstream loss is told (e.g., downstream
        loss report is received), which indicates to the receivers that they
        should not transmit feedback messages for the same loss event for a
        certain time. Therefore the distribution source in the feedback
        summary model can be reasonably certain that it will help the
        situation by sending this Third Party Loss Report message to all the
        relevant receivers impacted by the packet loss.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Unicast based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast Stream (RAMS) use case">
        <t>The typical RAMS architecture <xref target="RFC6285"></xref> may
        have several Burst/ Retransmission Sources(BRS) behind the multicast
        source (MS) placed at the same level. These BRSes will receive the
        primary multicast RTP stream from the media source and cache most
        recent packets after joining multicast session. If packet loss happens
        at the upstream of all the BRSs or the downstream of one or more
        BRSes. one of the BRSes or all the BRSes may send a NACK or TPLR
        message to the DS, where the SSRC in this NACK or TPLR message is the
        one of the BRS. The DS forwards/reflects this message down on the
        primary SSM. The details on how DS deal with this message is specified
        in <xref target="RETRANSMISSION-FOR-SSM"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="RTP transport translator use case">
        <t>A Transport Translator (Topo-Trn-Translator), as defined in <xref
        target="RFC5117"></xref> is typically forwarding the RTP and RTCP
        traffic between RTP clients, for example converting between multicast
        and unicast for domains that do not support multicast. The translator
        acting as quality monitoring <xref target="Monarch"></xref> may suffer
        a loss of important video packets. In this case, the translator may
        trigger repair by the media sender and at the same time,use it's own
        SSRC as packet sender SSRC to create a new Third Party Loss Report
        message and send it to the receivers that is not aware of packet
        loss.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) use case">
        <t>When the speaker is changed in a voice-activated multipoint video
        switching conference <xref target="RFC4587"></xref>, an RTP mixer can
        be used to select the available input streams and forward them to each
        participants. If the MCU is doing a blind switch without waiting for a
        synchronization point on the new stream it can send a FIR to the new
        video source. In this case the MCU should send a FIR suppression
        message to the new receivers. e.g.,when the RTP Mixer starts to
        receive FIR from some participants it can suppress the remaining
        session participants from sending FIR by sending out a Third party
        Loss report message.</t>

      <section title="Mixer use Case">
        <t>A Mixer, in accordance with <xref target="RFC5117"></xref>,
        aggregates multiple RTP streams from other session participants and
        generates a new RTP stream sent to the session participants. In some
        cases, the video frames may get badly screwed up between media source
        and the mixer. In such case, the mixer need to check if the packet
        loss will result in PLI or FIR transmissions from most of the group by
        analyzing the received video. If so the mixer initiates FIR or PLI
        towards the media source on behalf of all the session participants and
        send out a Third party Loss report message to these session
        participants that may or are expected to send a PLI or FIR Another
        possible way for mixer to deal with, is when the mixer starts to
        receive FIR or PLI from some participants and like to suppress the
        remaining session participants from sending FIR or PLI by sending out
        a Third party Loss report message.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The defined messages have certain properties that have security
      implications. These must be addressed and taken into account by users of
      this protocol.</t>

      <t>Spoofed or maliciously created feedback messages of the type defined
      in this specification can have the following implications:</t>

      <t>Sending the spurious Third Party Loss Report (e.g., the Third Party
      Loss Report with the wrong sequence number of lost packet) that makes
      missing RTP packets can not be compensated.</t>

      <t>To prevent these attacks, there is a need to apply authentication and
      integrity protection of the feedback messages. This can be accomplished
      against threats external to the current RTP session using the RTP
      profile that combines Secure RTP <xref target="RFC3711"></xref> and AVPF
      into SAVPF <xref target="RFC5124"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Note that middleboxes that are not visible at the RTP layer that wish
      to send the Third Party Loss Reports on behalf of the media source can
      only do so if they spoof the SSRC of the media source. This is difficult
      in case SRTP is in use. If the middlebox is visible at the RTP layer,
      this is not an issue, provided the middlebox is part of the security
      context for the session.</t>

      <t>Also note that endpoints that receive a Third Party Loss Report would
      be well-advised to ignore it, unless the security is in place to
      authenticate the sender of the Third Party Loss Report. Accepting Third
      Party Loss Report from un-authenticated sender can lead to a denial of
      service attack, where the endpoint accepts poor quality media that could
      be repaired.</t>
