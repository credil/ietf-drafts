Abstract

   This document describes a pseudowire mechanism that is used to
   transport a packet service over an MPLS PSN is the case where the
   client LSR and the server PE are co-resident in the same equipment.

Internet-Draft                  Packet PW                      July 2011


1.  Introduction

   There is a need to provide a method of carrying a packet service over
   an MPLS PSN in a way that provides isolation between the two
   networks.  The server MPLS network may be an MPLS network or a
   network conforming to the MPLS-TP [RFC5317].  The client may also be
   either a MPLS network of a network conforming to the MPLS-TP.
   Considerations regarding the use of an MPLS network as a server for
   an MPLS-TP network are outside the scope of this document.

   Where the client equipment is connected to the server equipment via
   physical interface, the same data-link type MUST be used to attach
   the clients to the Provider Edge equipments (PE)s, and a pseudowire
   (PW) of the same type as the data-link MUST be used [RFC3985].  The
   reason that inter-working between different physical and data-link
   attachment types is specifically disallowed in the pseudowire
   architecture is because this is a complex task and not a simple bit-
   mapping exercise.  The inter-working is not limited to the physical
   and data-link interfaces and the state-machines.  It also requires a
   compatible approach to the formation of the adjacencies between
   attached client network equipment.  As an example the reader should
   consider the differences between router adjacency formation on a
   point to point link compared to a multi-point to multi-point
   interface (e.g.  Ethernet).

   A further consideration is that two adjacent MPLS LSRs do not simply
   exchange MPLS packets.  They exchange IP packets for adjacency
   formation, control, routing, label exchange, management and
   monitoring purposes.  In addition they may exchange data-link packets
   as part of routing (e.g.  IS-IS hellos and IS-IS LSPs) and for OAM
   purposes such as Link Layer Discovery protocol [IEEE standard
   802.1AB-2009].  Thus the two clients require an attachment mechanism
   that can be used to multiplex a number of protocols.  In addition it
   is essential to the correct operation of the network layer that all
   of these protocols fate share.

   Where the client LSR and server PE is co-located in the same
   equipment, the data-link layer can be simplified to a simple protocol
   identifier (PID) that is used to multiplex the various data-link
   types onto a pseudowire.  This is the method that described in this
   document.


2.  Network Reference Model

   The network reference model for the packet pseudowire operating in an
   MPLS network is shown in Figure 1.  This is an extension of Figure 3
   "Pre-processing within the PWE3 Network Reference Model" from

   In this model LSRs, LSR1 and LSR2, are part of the client MPLS packet
   switched network (PSN).  The PEs, PE1 and PE2 are part of the server
   PSN, that is to be used to provide connectivity between the client
   LSRs.  The attachment circuit that is used to connect the MPLS LSRs
   to the PEs is a virtual interface within the equipment.  A packet
   pseudowire is used to provide connectivity between these virtual
   interfaces.  This packet pseudowire is used to transport all of the
   required layer 2 and layer 3 between protocols between LSR1 and LSR2.


3.  Client Network Layer Model

   The packet PW appears as a single point to point link to the client
   layer.  Network Layer adjacency formation and maintenance between the
   client equipments will the follow normal practice needed to support
   the required relationship in the client layer.  The assignment of
   metrics for this point to point link is a matter for the client
   layer.  In a hop by hop routing network the metrics would normally be
   assigned by appropriate configuration of the embedded client network

   layer equipment (e.g. the embedded client LSR).  Where the client was
   using the packet PW as part of a traffic engineered path, it is up to
   the operator of the client network to ensure that the server layer
   operator provides the necessary service level agreement.


4.  Forwarding Model

   The packet PW forwarding model is illustrated in Figure 2.  The
   forwarding operation can be likened to a virtual private network
   (VPN), in which a forwarding decision is first taken at the client
   layer, an encapsulation is applied and then a second forwarding
   decision is taken at the server layer.

                   Figure 2: Packet PW Forwarding Model

   A packet PW PE comprises three components, the client LSR, PW
   processor and a server LSR.  Note that [RFC3985] does not formally
   indicate the presence of the server LSR because it does not concern
   itself with the server layer.  However it is useful in this document
   to recognise that the server LSR exists.

   It may be useful to first recall the operation of a layer two PW such
   as an Ethernet PW [RFC4448] within this model.  The client LSR is not
   present and packets arrive directly on the attachment circuit (AC)
   which is part of the client network.  The PW undertakes any header
   processing, if configured to do so, it then pushes the PW control
   word (CW), and finally pushes the PW label.  The PW function then
   passes the packet to the LSR function which pushes the label needed
   to reach the egress PE and forwards the packet to the next hop in the
   server network.  At the egress PE, the packet typically arrives with
   the PW label at top of stack, the packet is thus directed to the
   correct PW instance.  The PW instance performs any required

   reconstruction using, if necessary, the CW and the packet is sent
   directly to the attachment circuit.

   Now let us consider the case client layer MPLS traffic being carried
   over a packet PW.  An LSR belonging to the client layer is embedded
   within the PE equipment.  This is a type of native service processing
   element [RFC3985].  This LSR determines the next hop in the client
   layer, and pushes the label needed by the next hop in the client
   layer.  It then passes the packet to the correct PW instance
   indicating the packet protocol type.  If the PW is configured to
   require a CW this is pushed.  The PW instance then examines the
   protocol type and pushes a label that identifies the protocol type to
   the egress PE.  The PW instance then proceeds as it would for a layer
   two PW, by pushing the PW label and then handing the packet to the
   server layer LSR for delivery.  At egress, the packet again arrives
   with the PW label at the top of stack which causes the packet to be
   passed to the correct PW instance.  This PW instance knows that the
   PW type is a packet PW, and hence that it needs to interpret the next
   label as a protocol type identifier.  If necessary the CW is then
   popped and processed.  The packet is then passed to the egress client
   LSR together with information that identifies the packet protocol
   type.  The egress client LSR then forwards the packet in the normal
   manner for a protocol of that type.

   Note that although the description above is written in terms of the
   behaviour of an MPLS LSR, the processing model would be similar for
   an IP packet, or indeed any other protocol type.

   Note that the semantics of the PW between the client LSRs is a point
   to point link.


5.  Packet PW Encapsulation

   The client network work layer packet encapsulation into a packet PW
   is shown in Figure 3.

   This conforms to the PW protocols stack as defined in [RFC4448].  The
   protocol stack is unremarkable except to note that the stack does not
   retain 32 bit alignment between the virtual Ethernet header and the
   PW optional control word (or the PW label when the optional
   components are not present in the PW header).  This loss of 32 bit of
   alignment is necessary to preserve backwards compatibility with the
   Ethernet PW design [RFC4448]

   Ethernet Raw Mode (PW type 5) MUST be used for the packet PW.

   The PEs MAY use a local Ethernet address for the Ethernet header used
   to encapsulate the client network layer packet.  Alternatively the
   PEs may use the following proceedure.

   IANA are requested to allocate two unicast Ethernet addresses
   [RFC5342] to this protocol (PacketPWEthA and PacketPWEthB).
   PacketPWEthA is the value lower Ethernet address and PacketPWEthB is
   the higher value Ethernet address.  Where [RFC4447] signalling is
   used to set up the PW, the LDP peers compare IP addresses and with
   the PE with the higher IP address uses PacketPWEthA, whilst the LDP
   peer with the lower IP address uses PacketPWEthB.

   Where no signalling PW protocol is used, suitable Ethernet addresses
   MUST be configured at each PE.

   Not withstanding the fact that this PW represents a point to point
   connection, some client layer protocols require the use of a

   destination mulitcast address in the Ethernet encapsulation.  This
   mode of operation MUST be supported.


6.  Ethernet Functional Restrictions

   The use of Ethernet as the encapsulation mechanism for traffic
   between the server LSRs is a convenience based on the widespread
   availability of existing hardware.  In this application there is no
   requirement for any Ethernet feature other than its protocol
   multiplexing capability.  Thus, for example, the Ethernet OAM is NOT
   REQUIRED.

   The use and applicability of Ethernet VLANs, 802.1p, and 802.1Q
   between PEs is not supported.

   Point to multipoint and multipoint to multipoint operation of the
   virtual Ethernet is not supported.


7.  Congestion Considerations

   A packet pseudowire is normally used to carry IP, MPLS and their
   associated support protocols over an MPLS network.  There are no
   congestion considerations beyond those that ordinarily apply to an IP
   or MPLS network.  Where the packet protocol being carried is not IP
   or MPLS and the traffic volumes are greater than that ordinarily
   associated with the support protocols in an IP or MPLS network, the
   congestion considerations being developed for PWs apply [RFC3985],
   [RFC5659].


8.  Security Considerations

   The virtual Ethernet approach to packet PW introduces no new security
   risks.  A more detailed discussion of pseudowire security is given in
   [RFC3985], [RFC4447] and [RFC3916].

Appendix A.  Encapsulation Approaches Considered

   A number of approaches to the design of a packet pseudowire (PW) have
   been investigated and have been described at the IETF.  This section
   discusses the approaches that were analysed and the technical issues
   that the authors took into consideration in arriving at the proposed
   approach.

   In a typical network there are usually no more that four network
   layer protocols that need to be supported: IPv4, IPv6, MPLS and CLNS
   although any solution needs to be scalable to a larger number of
   protocols.  The approaches considered in this document all satisfy
   this minimum requirement, but vary in their ability to support larger
   numbers of network layer protocols.

   Additionally it is beneficial if the complete set of protocols
   carried over the network between in support of a set of CE peers fate
   share.  It is additionally beneficial if a single OAM session can be
   used to monitor the behaviour of this complete set.  During the
   investigation various views were expressed as to where on the scale
   from absolutely required to "nice to have" these benefits lay, but in
   the end they were not a factor in reaching our conclusion.

   There are four candidate approaches that have been analysed:

   1.  A protocol identifier (PID) in the PW Control Word (CW)

   2.  A PID label

   3.  Parallel PWs - one per protocol.

   4.  Virtual Ethernet

A.1.  A Protocol Identifier in the Control Word

   This is the approach that we proposed in draft 0 of this document .
   The proposal was that a Protocol Identifier (PID) would included in
   the PW control word (CW), by appending it to the generic control word
   [RFC5385] to make a 6 byte CW (the version 0 draft actually included
   two reserved bytes to provide 32bit alignment, but let us assume that
   was optimized out).  A variant of this is just to use a 2 byte PID
   without a control word.

   This is a simple approach, and is basically a virtual PPP interface
   without the PPP control protocol.  This has a smaller MTU than for

   example a virtual Ethernet would need, however in forwarding terms it
   is not as simple as the PID label or multiple PW approaches described
   next, and may not be deployable on a number of existing hardware
   platforms.

A.2.  PID Label

   This is the approach that we described in Version 2 of this document.
   The in this mechanism the PID is indicated by including a label after
   the PW label that indicates the protocol type as shown in Figure 4.

   +-------------------------------+
   |            Client             |
   |          Network Layer        |
   |            packet             |  n octets
   |                               |
   +-------------------------------+
   |    Optional Control Word      |  4 octets
   +-------------------------------+
   |        PID Label (S=1)        |  4 Octets
   +-------------------------------+
   |          PW label             |  4 octets
   +-------------------------------+
   |   Server MPLS Tunnel Label(s) |  n*4 octets (four octets per label)
   +-------------------------------+

                              balancing label

   In the PID Label approach a new Label Distribution protocol (LDP)
   Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) element is used to signal the
   mapping between protocol type and the PID label.  This approach
   complies with RFC3031.

   A similar approach to PID label is described in Section 3.4.5 of
   [RFC5921].  In this case when the client is a network layer packet
   service such as IP or MPLS, a service label and demultiplexer label
   (which may be combined) is used to provide the necessary
   identifications needed to carry this traffic over an LSP.

   The authors surveyed the hardware designs produced by a number of
   companies across the industry and concluded that whilst the approach
   complies with the MPLS architecture, it may conflict with a number of
   designer's interpretation of the existing MPLS architecture.  This
   led to concerns that the approach may result in unexpected
   difficulties in the future.  Specifically there is an assumption in
   many designs that a forwarding decision should be made on the basis

   of a single label.  Whilst the approach is attractive, it cannot be
   supported by many commodity chip sets and this would require new
   hardware which would increase the cost of deployment and delay the
   introduction of a packet PW service.

A.3.  Parallel PWs

   In this approach one PW is constructed for each protocol type that
   must be carried between the PEs.  Thus a complete packet PW would
   therefore consist of a bundle of PWs .  This model would be very
   simple and efficient from a forwarding point of view.  The number of
   parallel PWs required would normally be relatively small.  In a
   typical network there are usually no more that four network layer
   protocols that need to be supported: IPv4, IPv6, MPLS and CLNS
   although any solution needs to be scalable to a larger number of
   protocols.

   The are a number of serious downsides with this approach:

   1.  From an operational point of view the lack of fate sharing
       between the protocol types can lead to complex faults which are
       difficult to diagnose.

   2.  There is an undesirable trade off in the OAM related to the first
       point.  Either we would have to run an OAM on each PW and bind
       them together which lead to significant protocol and software
       complexity and does not scale well.  Alternatively we would need
       to run a single OAM session on one of the PWs as a proxy for the
       others and the diagnose any more complex failure on a case by
       case basis.  To some extent the issue of fate sharing between
       protocol in the bundle (for example the assumed fate sharing
       between CLNS and IP in IS-IS) can be mitigated through the use of
       BFD.

   3.  The need to configure manage and synchronize the behaviour of a
       group of PWs as if they were a single PW leads to an increase in
       control plane complexity.

   The Parallel PW mechanism is therefore an approach which simplifies
   the forwarding plane, but only at a cost of a considerable increase
   in other aspects of the design and in particular operation of the PW.

A.4.  Virtual Ethernet

   Using a virtual Ethernet to provide a packet PW would require PEs to
   include a virtual (internal) Ethernet interface and then to use an
   Ethernet PW [RFC4448] to carry the user traffic.  This is
   conceptually simple and can be implemented today without any further

   standards action, although there are a number of applicability
   considerations that it is useful to draw to the attention of the
   community.

   Conceptually this is a simple approach and some deployed equipments
   can already do this.  However the requirement to run a complete
   Ethernet adjacency lead us to conclude that there was a need to
   identify a simpler approach.  The packets encapsulated in an Ethernet
   header have a larger MTU than the other approaches, although this is
   not considered to be an issue on the networks needing to carry packet
   PWs.

   The virtual Ethernet mechanism was the first approach that the
   authors considered, before the merits of the other approaches
   appeared to make them more attractive.  As we shall see below
   however, the other approaches were not without issues and it appears
   that the virtual Ethernet is preferred approach to providing a packet
   PW.

A.5.  Recommended Encapsulation

   The operational complexity and the breaking of fate sharing
   assumptions associated with the parallel PW approach would suggest
   that this is not an approach that should be further pursued.

   The PID Label approach gives rise to the concerns that it will break
   implicit behavioural and label stack size assumptions in many
   implementations.  Whilst those assumptions may be addressed with new
   hardware this would delay the introduction of the technology to the
   point where it was unlikely to gain acceptance in competition with an
   approach that needed no new protocol design and is already
   supportable on many existing hardware platforms.

   The PID in the CW leads to the most compact protocol stack, is simple
   and requires minimal protocol work.  However it is a new forwarding
   design, and apart from the issue of the larger packet header and the
   simpler adjacency formation offers no advantage over the virtual
   Ethernet.

   The above considerations bring us back to the virtual Ethernet, which
   is a well known protocol stack, with a well known (internal) client
   interface.  It is already implemented in many hardware platforms and
   is therefore readily deployable.  The authors conclude that having
   considered a number of initially promising alternatives, the
   simplicity and existing hardware make the virtual Ethernet approach
   to the packet PW the most attractive solution.
