    <abstract>
      <t>STD numbers are assigned to IETF Standards Track
		 specifications in order to provide a stable reference even
		 when RFCs are revised and the underlying documents change.
		 However, the numbers are only assigned when the
		 specifications reach Full Standard maturity level,
		 significantly reducing their utility in the contemporary
		 world
		 in which few specifications advance to Full, or even Draft,
		 Standard.  For that reason, one recent proposal suggested
		 eliminating the numbers entirely.  This document argues that
		 stable references for Standards Track specifications are
		 actually useful and that the solution is not to abolish the
		 numbers but to change the point at which they are assigned.</t>

    <section title="Introduction and Rationale">
	   <t>STD numbers <xref target="RFC2026"/> are assigned to IETF
		  Standards Track 
		 specifications in order to provide a stable reference even
		 when RFCs are revised and the underlying documents change.
		 However, the numbers are only assigned when the
		 specifications reach Full Standard maturity level,
		 significantly reducing their utility in the contemporary
		 world
		 in which few specifications advance to Full, or even Draft,
		 Standard.  For that reason, one recent proposal
		 <xref target="I-D.housley-two-maturity-levels"/> suggested
		 eliminating the numbers entirely.  This document argues that
		 stable references for Standards Track specifications are
		 actually useful and that the solution is not to abolish the
		 numbers but to change the point at which they are
		 assigned.</t>
	  <t> During the discussion of the document that proposed to
		 eliminate these numbers
		 <xref target="I-D.housley-two-maturity-levels"/> at IETF 78,
		 there appeared to be little support for keeping STD numbers
		 in their current form (assigned only to Full Standards).
		 There was no discussion of assigning them earlier because
		 that option was not listed in the subject I-D.  That may have
		 been a serious omission since similar stable references have proven
		 to be very useful in the BCP case and might be even more
		 useful if better supported by available tools (there are no
		 provisions in
		 xml2rfc (<xref target="RFC2629">RFC 2629 et seq.</xref>) for
		 easily constructing references to multiple-document BCPs or
		 STDs, nor does the current RFC Style Manual provide guidance
		 as to how such references should be laid out).</t>
		 
	  <t>Note in Draft: The author strongly prefers a more
		 comprehensive solution to current perceived problems with
		 maturity levels and STD numbers, a solution such as that described in
		 <xref target="I-D.klensin-isdbis"/>, but it seems useful to
		 get a narrowly-scoped proposal about STD numbers on the
		 table at this time.</t>
    </section>

	<section title="Proposal">
	   <section title="Changes to RFC 2026">
	   <t> Update RFC 2026, BCP 9, as follows:
		  <list style="hanging">
				<t hangText="Section 2.1, paragraph 5"><vspace/>
				   Change: "Some RFCs document Internet Standards"
				   <vspace/>
				   To: "Some RFC documents IETF Standards at various
				   maturity lavels".
				   <vspace blankLines="1"/>
				   Change the note: "(see section 4.1.3)"
				   <vspace/>
				   To: "(see Section 4)"</t>
				<t hangText="Section 4">
				   Add a new paragraph after the first paragraph of
				   this section ("Specifications that are intended to
				   become...") that reads:
				   <vspace blankLines="1"/>
				   A specification that reaches the status of Proposed
				   Standard is assigned a number in the STD series.
				   It retains that STD number as it progresses along
				   the Standards Track (that progression usually
				   involves a change in
				   RFC numbers).  The STD number is also retained when
				   the relevant protocol is updated or replaced for other
				   reasons (see <xref target="RFC1311"/>).</t>
				   
				<t hangText="Section 4.1.3">
				   Remove the second paragraph, which begins "A
				   specification that reaches..."</t>
				</list></t>
			 </section>
			 <section title="RFC 1311 Changes">
				<t>Informally, this document also updates the
				   Informational RFC 1311 to make it refer to all
				   Standards Track documents.  It may be useful to
				   replace RFC 1311 at some point, but that should not
				   be a high-priority task, nor should it block
				   approval of the change suggested in this
				   document.</t>
			 </section>
			 </section>

	<section title="Transition">
	   <t>STD numbers are useful for documentation and other
		  references.  Whether they are assigned or not does not
		  change the actual status of any given document.  STD numbers
		  have historically been assigned by the RFC Editor and this
		  document does not propose to change that responsibility
		  (even though, in the current multi-stream model for RFCs,
		  having them assigned by the Secretariat under IESG
		  supervision might make more sense).  In
		  the interest of avoiding both heavyweight processes and the
		  need for a period of concentrated effort, STD numbers will
		  be assigned only when:
		  <list style="numbers">
			 <t>A new Standards Track specification is published, at
				any maturity level.</t>
			 <t>An update or replacement is published for a Standards
				track specification for which an STD number has not
				already been assigned, specifically including
				changes or grade or recycling in grade.  Authors, WGs,
				or ADs responsible for such specifications are
				strongly encouraged to supply the RFC Editor with any
				desired grouping information, i.e., the identification
				of specifications that should also be assigned the
				same STD number.</t>
			 <t>On the request of any Area Director who concludes that
				assignment of an STD number to a particular
				specification or group of specifications would
				facilitate documentation, understanding of the
				specification, or other uses.  Especially when the
				number is to be assigned to a group of specifications,
				Area Directors are encouraged to seek community input
				on the decisions being made, but neither such input
				nor a more formal Last Call are required by this
				document.</t>
			 </list></t>
		     <t>This transition approach explicitly recognizes the
				principle that STD numbers that would not be used need
				not be assigned and that not assigning them does no
				harm.  It prefers a "just in time" approach for
				existing specifications.</t>

      <t>This document is an intellectual descendant of a NEWTRK WG
		 specification called "Identifying Standards Track Documents"
		 <xref target="I-D.ietf-newtrk-docid"/>.  It differs from that
		 specification largely by suggesting an even lighter-weight
		 transition process.  The present work would not have been
		 possible without those earlier discussions.</t>
