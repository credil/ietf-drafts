          draft-amundsen-item-and-collection-link-relations-03

Abstract

   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] standardized a means of indicating the
   relationships between resources on the Web. This specification
   defines a pair of reciprocal link relation types that may be used to
   express the relationship between a collection and its members.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] standardized a means of indicating the
   relationships between resources on the Web. This specification
   defines a pair of reciprocal link relation types that may be used to
   express the relationship between a collection and its members.

   These link relation types can be applied to a wide range of use cases
   across multiple media types.  For example, the 'collection' and
   'item' link relation types are used in these media types:

   1.  OpenSearch 1.1: see Section 4.5.4.1 of [OpenSearch]

   2.  Maze+XML: see Section 3 of [Maze]

   3.  Collection+JSON: see Section 5 of [CollectionJSON]

2.  Link Relations

   The following link relations are defined.

2.1.  'item'

   When included in a resource which represents a collection, the 'item'
   link relation identifies a target resource that represents a member
   of that collection.

   For example, if a resource represents a catalog of products, that
   same representation may include one or more links to resources which
   represent members of that catalog.

   <html>
   ...
     <h1>Product Group X Listing</h1>
     ...
     <a href="..." rel="item">View Product X001</a>
     <a href="..." rel="item">View Product X002</a>
     ...
   </html>

   or

   Link: <...>; rel="item"; title="View Product X001"
   Link: <...>; rel="item"; title="View Product X002"

2.2.  'collection'

   When included in a resource which represents a member of a
   collection, the 'collection' link relation identifies a target
   resource that represents a collection of which the context resource
   is a member.

   For example, if a resource represents a single product in a catalog,
   that same representation may include a link to a resource which
   represents a product group to which this single product belongs:

   <a href="..." rel="collection">Return to Product Group X</a>

   or

   Link: <...>; rel="collection"; title="Return to Product Group X"

   Since it is possible that a resource could be a member of multiple
   collections, multiple 'collection' link relations may appear within
   the same representation:

   <a href="..." rel="collection">View other widgets</a>
   <a href="..." rel="collection">View all discontinued items</a>

   The target resource representation need not be restricted to
   representing a list.  It may simply be a document that provides
   details on the collection of which the context resource is a member:

   Link: <...>; rel="collection";
         title="Shakespeare's Collected Works - A History"

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the 'collection' and 'item' Link Relations
   below as per [RFC5988].

3.1.  'item' Link Relation Registration

   Relation Name:

      item

   Description:

      The target IRI points to a resource that is a member of the
      collection represented by the context IRI.

   Reference:

      See Section 2

3.2.  'collection' Link Relation Registration

   Relation Name:

      collection

   Description:

      The target IRI points to a resource which represents a collection
      of which the context IRI is a member.

   Reference:

      See Section 2

4.  Security Considerations

   The two link relation types defined in this document are not believed
   to introduce any new security issues to those which are discussed in
   Section 7 of RFC5988 [RFC5988].

5.  Internationalisation Considerations

   The 'item' and 'collection' link relation types do not have any
   internationalization considerations other than those which are
   discussed in Section 8 of RFC5988 [RFC5988].
