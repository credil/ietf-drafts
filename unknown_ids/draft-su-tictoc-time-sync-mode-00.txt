Internet-Draft      Time sync mode in mobile backhaul       October 2008


1.  Introduction

   As the transport network for mobile backhaul has being migrated from
   circuit-switched technology to packet-switched technology such as
   Ethernet, IP/MPLS, packet-switched transport network is expected to
   provide timing and synchronization distribution function as SDH/SONET
   network does.

   In 2G mobile backhaul network (e.g.  GSM), only frequency
   synchronization is needed largely by locking base station clock onto
   a PRC traceable frequency source (i.e.  E1/T1 links).  By
   introduction of 3G cellular system (e.g.  UMTS TDD, CDMA2000, TD-
   SCDMA, WiMAX), base stations need to be aligned each other in phase/
   time in order to guarantee smooth handover. 3G system with TDD mode
   stringently requires micro-second level time/phase synchronization.
   So currently the prevalent way to satisfy this requirement is that
   base station is synchronized to UTC time by installing GPS receiver
   on each of them.  Due to the high cost and security issues, cellular
   operators are seeking solutions to replace or minimize the use of GPS
   and thus to distributes time/phase synchronization through transport
   network to base stations.

   This I-D describes how to transport time/phase employing popular
   packet-based method IEEE Std 1588-2008 i.e.  PTP with support of
   common physical layer method Synchronous Ethernet in a packet-
   switched transport network for mobile backhaul and a preliminary
   thought of time transfer error detection.

3.  Time distribution in packet-switched transport network

   The transport network in mobile backhaul between RNC and base station
   in general comprises aggregation part and access part.  The RNC is
   connected to aggregation equipment (e.g. router or switch) which
   could be selected as time server or Grand Master (GM) in terms of PTP
   protocol.  In this case, the equipment receives the UTC time by
   dedicated time interface (e.g. 1PPS + ToD) from GPS or BITS.  The
   time server distributes time information by PTP interface to RNC and
   downstream equipment respectively.  At the far end, access equipment
   outputs time signal to base station via dedicated time interface
   (e.g. 1PPS + ToD) or synchronizes the base station via PTP interface.

   The later case requires that the base station support PTP protocol.
   The time distribution path from the GM to end equipment is logically
   a tree like topology.

3.1.  Equipment type

   There are basically two types of equipment in the time
   synchronization network, named PTP equipment and non-PTP equipment.
   PTP equipment includes standalone or integrated devices that
   implement Ordinary clock, Boundary clock, End-to-End transparent
   clock, Peer-to-Peer transparent clock or Management nodes.  In this
   I-D, we focus on application of PTP equipment with Ordinary clock and
   Boundary clock.  Other types of devices would be discussed in future.
   PTP equipment could enable BMC algorithm and each PTP port could be
   configured to use Delay Request-response measurement or Peer Delay
   measurement.  Non-PTP equipment refers to switches or routers that
   deal with PTP packet as general data unit.

   Normally, the number of nodes in aggregation network is much smaller
   than that in access network.  So the employment of non-PTP equipment
   in aggregation network, in some respects, avoids the accumulated
   phase error induced by Boundary clock at cost of increasing the
   processing load of GM as well as introducing more PDV.  In real
   network engineering, the PTP packet from GM may traverse some non-PTP
   equipments and is terminated by equipments with Boundary clock at the
   demarcation point of aggregation network and access network.

3.2.  Synchronous Ethernet support

   PTP is based on the idea that master clock periodically adjust slave
   clock by calculating time difference between, compensated by
   transmission delay and latency.  So the frequency accuracy and
   stability of slave clock has considerable impact on the performance
   of PTP system.  If the slave, for example, has local clock with
   frequency accuracy of 1ppm, the generated time offset rate will be
   1us per second.  This could be unacceptable for design and
   engineering of the network.  In fact, the frequency accuracy of local
   clock has worse freerun or holdover performance than 1ppm in most of
   equipments particularly in access network.  On the other hand, the
   better frequency accuracy makes the slave clock come into steady
   state as soon as possible, i.e. minimize the convergence time of the
   PTP.  The less convergence time is also addressed by operators in
   case time source and/or time synchronization path protection switch
   occurs.

   A possible way to enhance the performance under condition of low
   quality local clock is to increase the sync packet rate of master
   clock in PTP, e.g. 100 or 1000 packet per second, but this would not

   be always effective if the congestion is introduced by intermediate
   non-PTP equipments.  Obviously, the high rate of sync packet brings
   out more bandwidth consumption and spending of CPU resources.

   Alternatively, the Synchronous Ethernet is a physical layer method
   that locks local clock to external stable frequency source or line
   timing signal from frequency synchronization network traceable to
   PRC.  This provides an easy and reliable scheme for the time
   synchronization path to build the PTP operation on well-synchronized
   frequency distribution path.  Each Boundary clock implements
   Synchronous Ethernet function including SSM detection and processing.

3.3.  Building of time synchronization path

   The overview of time synchronization path construction is given by
   the flow chart in Figure 1

   Initially, a frequency synchronization path is formed on a link by
   link basis.  The primary frequency source of the backhaul network
   could be the same source of time, e.g. given by GPS.  In this case,
   all PTP equipments (with Ordinary clock or Boundary clock)
   hierarchically follow the frequency output of GM and a tree like
   frequency synchronization path is established from the GM to end
   equipments in the access network.  The frequency source cloud be
   otherwise given from existing synchronization network and/or other
   external frequency source (e.g.  BITS/SSU).  The PTP equipment should
   perform clock source selection among multi frequency sources (e.g.
   recovered line timing from GE or 10GE Synchronous Ethernet links
   and/or external frequency source) by means of SSM detection or pre-
   configuration.  It is noted that, the timing loop in frequency
   synchronization path should be prevented by network engineering or
   some enhanced automatic SSM mechanisms in order to avoid clock
   quality degradation.

   After all nodes clock have entered into locked mode, each NE decides
   the PTP port state according to frequency source state.

   O  The slave port of PTP could be uniquely the physical port from
      which the timing signal is received and selected as reference
      frequency source.  When multi PTP time source exist, the BMC
      chooses the best master clock from set of priorities and thus
      logically selects the only PTP slave port.  The rest of valid
      clock source ports bound with PTP should be set as PTP master
      port.

   O  Particularly, if the frequency reference source of the node is
      internal clock (e.g. fed by BITS/SSU), no PTP slave port is
      selected and all other ports are configured as PTP master port.

   O  The invalid or non-configured frequency source ports shall be
      treated as PTP passive port.

   O  If the node enters into holdover mode or before it locks/relocks
      to certain frequency reference source, time holdover steps in and
      PTP will neither change the port state nor receive and send sync
      packets until frequency stable state is recovered.

3.4.  Frequency and time distribution path switch

   To show the relationship between time distribution path and frequency
   distribution path, and also the switch process of each, Figure 2 and
   Figure 3 are given below.  In Figure 2, PTP equipment A, B, C, D, E
   and F are interconnected by Synchronous Ethernet links in a ring
   topology.  The time and frequency reference source of the network are
   co-located.  The port I of each node is set to priority 1, the port
   II of each node is set to priority 2 in accordance with ITU-T G.781.
   Each node selects frequency reference source based on SSM code in QL-
   enabled mode as defined in ITU-T G.8264 and G.781.  The frequency
   distribution path is indicated by flow arrows when all nodes are in
   locked mode.  Port III of node A is configured as PTP slave port and
   port I and II are configured as PTP master port.  Other nodes assign
   the PTP port state by above given rules.  In this example, no PTP
   port is assigned as passive state.  Finally, the time distribution
   path is formed congruent with frequency distribution path.

   Figure 3 shows the case when the link between node E and node F is
   broken.  Time distribution path stays unchanged but node E enters
   into time holdover and stop transmitting PTP message at master port.
   At the same time, node E sends SSM code DNU to inform node D to
   switch the frequency source.  When node D finishes clock source
   switch, node E will follow line timing from port II of node D. At
   last, node D and node E re-entered into locked mode, thus a new
   frequency distribution path is built indicated by flow arrows.  The
   PTP port state of node D and node E are consequently switched.  Time
   transfer restores with the new time distribution path along rebuilt
   frequency distribution path.

4.  Fault detection

4.1.  Problem of time synchronization OAM

   Although PTP is considered an effective way to deliver accurate time
   in telecom transport network, the measurement and diagnosis of time
   transfer error is not yet accomplished.  Telecom network requires
   omplete OAM functionality to improve the robustness and availability
   of network.  So the time synchronization OAM will be a key to the
   full deployment of PTP in telecom transport network.

   So far, the approach to know the time transfer defects is to test the
   time offset between particular PTP node or end equipment and time
   reference represented by metrics such as MTIE or TDEV.  But in a
   complex transport network with thousands of intermediate nodes and/or
   end equipments, it is not practical to make such test from one piece
   of equipment to another.  Moreover, this kind of test is normally
   carried out using GPS to provide time reference source.  This would
   really increase the OPEX of operators.

   There are many unknown reasons giving rise to time inaccuracy.  In a
   PTP time transfer network connected by Boundary clock, the
   accumulation of phase error needs to be considered.  Another major
   factor affecting PTP performance is the transmission delay asymmetry.
   The strict control of transmission media length (e.g. fibers) in
   network engineering is not always a simple thing.  PTP does not
   specify the correction scheme of asymmetry but allows compensation
   options.  Currently, the delay asymmetry could be manually
   compensated by network management though it is subject to mis-
   configuration.  In a large scale network, the mis-configuration would
   unpredictably change the values of asymmetry compensation at some PTP
   equipments without interfering with time offset measurement of other
   nodes on the time distribution path.  Therefore, a detection
   operation is needed to indicate the location of defected nodes or
   links.

4.2.  Detection of time transfer error

   Basically, the telecom network operator needs some alarm indication
   mechanisms to know whether the time transfer is in normal condition.
   Then some fault location progress might be invoked.  This I-D
   describes a preliminary method that automatically detects and reports
   the status of time distribution path applicable to a ring topology.
   It could be a complementary scheme to the node-by-node test.

   The PTP equipment on the path is Boundary Clock and interconnected
   with Synchronous Ethernet links as shown in Figure 4.  The following
   discussion is under the assumption that the time distribution path in
   the ring has been established and no frequency and/or time path
   switch occurs during the detection period.

   O  The detection process starts from locating the test point.  The
      test point could be selected arbitrarily from PTP nodes on the
      ring.  In this example, node 1 is chosen for convenience.  The
      frequency and time distribution path originated from node 1 are
      indicated by dash flow arrows.

   O  An OAM message is generated from the test node on both directions
      of the ring.  The OAM message on each direction is time-stamped
      leaving the PTP port.  The test node records the original
      timestamp value (e.g. t0) and the original node ID.  A direction
      flag field is also set in the OAM message.

   O  Taking direction I for example, the timestamp value of the OAM
      message sent to node 2 is updated at the ingress PTP port by
      recoding the arriving time plus the transmission delay.  The
      transmission delay is estimated by ingress PTP port using Peer
      Delay measurement.  Node 2 will forward this OAM message to next

      hop on time distribution path (i.e. node 3).  At the egress PTP
      port, the timestamp value is re-written to the time when the
      message is leaving.  The new timestamp value includes the
      residence time of the OAM message at the node.  The forwarding of
      the OAM message continues by all other nodes on the ring with the
      same procedure that the timestamp value is updated.

   O  When the OAM message travels through all nodes on the ring back to
      the test node (node 1), node 1 will terminate the OAM message by
      checking the original node ID and record the arriving time of the
      OAM message at the ingress PTP port (e.g. ta).  Node 1 also
      extracts the timestamp value from the OAM message which contains
      the record of instant when the message leaves the last node on the
      ring (e.g. tr).  The test node (node 1) might compensate this
      value by adding the transmission delay of incoming link.

   O  Based on these time values, the test node could calculate the
      accumulated time error (delta) of all PTP nodes on the ring on
      direction I as follows:

         delta(I) = ta(I) - t0(I) - tr(I)

      Similarly, the test node could get the value of delta on the
      direction II using the same mechanism and calculation:

         delta(II) = ta(II) - t0(II) - tr(II)

      The test node judges the time transfer status of the ring
      comparing the difference between delta(I) and delta(II) with pre-
      determined threshold value.  If the difference is out of the
      threshold value, it is indicated that the time transfer is
      problematic somewhere and the test node thus reports alarm.

      The interpretation of this method is that the effect of time error
      resulted from path asymmetry could be revealed by differentiating
      accumulated time offset between test node and all other nodes on
      two opposite directions.  If the asymmetry of a single link
      exists, it would be clearly observed.  And if the asymmetry takes
      place on several links where they have negligible composite
      effect, the difference would be too small to detect, but this
      situation might be of very much low possibility.
