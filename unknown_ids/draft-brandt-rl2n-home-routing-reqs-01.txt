   for a wide set of purposes.  Examples include lighting control
   modules, heating control panels, light sensors, temperature sensors,
   gas/water leak detector, motion detectors, video surveillance,
   healthcare systems and advanced remote controls.  Because such

   devices only cover a limited radio range, multi-hop routing is often
   required.  Such devices are usually highly constrained in terms of
   resources such as battery and memory and operate in unstable
   environments.  The aim of this document is to specify the routing
   requirements for networks comprising such constrained devices in a
   home network environment.

1.  Terminology

   L2N: Low power and Lossy Network.

   RL2N: Routing in Low power and Lossy Networks.


2.  Introduction

   This document presents the home control and automation application
   specific requirements for Routing in Low power and Lossy Networks
   (RL2N).  In a modern home, a high number of wireless devices are used
   for a wide set of purposes.  Examples include lighting control
   modules, heating control panels, light sensors, temperature sensors,
   gas/water leak detector, motion detectors, video surveillance,
   healthcare systems and advanced remote controls.  Basic home control
   modules such as wall switches and plug-in modules may be turned into
   an advanced home automation solution via the use of an IP-enabled
   application reading wall switches, motion sensors, light sensors,
   rain sensors, and so on.

   Because such devices only cover a limited radio range, multi-hop
   routing is often required.  These devices are usually highly
   constrained in term of resources such as battery and memory and
   operate in unstable environments.  Persons moving around in a house,
   opening or closing a door or starting a vacuum cleaner affect
   reception of weak radio signals.  Reflection and absorption may cause
   a reliable connection to turn unreliable for a period of time and
   then being reusable again, thus the term "lossy".

   Section 3 describes a few typical use cases for home automation
   applications.  Section 4 discusses the routing requirements for
   networks comprising such constrained devices in a home network
   environment.  These requirements may be overlapping requirements
   derived from other application-specific requirements documents or as
   listed in [I-D.culler-rl2n-routing-reqs].


3.  Home automation applications

   Home automation applications represent a special segment of networked
   wireless devices with its unique set of requirements.  To facilitate
   the requirements discussion in Section 4, this section lists a few
   typical use cases of home automation applications.  New applications
   are being developed at a high pace and this section does not mean to
   be exhaustive.

Internet-Draft   draft-brandt-rl2n-home-routing-reqs-01        July 2007


3.1.  Turning off the house

   Using the direct analogy to an electronic car key, a house owner may
   stand at the gate and activate the "leaving home" function from his/
   her electronic house key, mobile phone, etc.  For the sake of visual
   impression, all lights should turn off at the same time.  At least,
   it should appear to happen at the same time.  A well-known problem in
   home automation is the "popcorn effect": Lamps are turned on one at a
   time, at a rate so slow that it is clearly visible.  Obviously, this
   mostly apply to very low bandwidth RF systems.  Some existing home
   automation solutions use a clever mix of a "subnet groupcast" message
   with no acknowledgement and no forwarding before sending acknowledged
   singlecast messages to each lighting device.  Broadcast packets
   cannot be used for this since some lights should stay on (thus
   traditional IP multicast cannot be used for such applications).  The
   light controller forms the groups and decides which light modules
   should receive "turn-off" or "turn-on" requests.

3.2.  Moving a remote control around

   Advanced multi-function remote control may be used for dimming the
   light in the dining room while eating, turning up the music while
   doing the dishes in the kitchen and then, later on, turn lights down
   and start a DVD in the home theater.  The music is stopped at the
   same time.  Reaction must appear to be instant (within a few hundreds
   of milliseconds) even when the remote control has moved to a new
   location.  Devices that needed routing to be reached before may be
   accessible directly now and vice versa.  A remote control is a
   typical example of mobile device in a home network.

3.3.  Adding a new lamp module to the system

   This apparently simple action may be addressed in a number of ways,
   depending on philosophy.  The main issue is that the small-size, low-
   cost modules may have no user interface except for a single button.
   Thus, an automated inclusion process is needed for light controllers
   to find new modules.

3.3.1.  Register lamp with portable remote control

   A remote control may control all lamps in the house.  The new lamp
   module is powered at its final location.  A discovery mechanism
   (potentially based on a broadcast-based protocol) makes the remote
   control discover the new module within direct range.  The user sets
   up rules in the remote control for control of the lamp module.  The
   lamp module being powered up at the final location triggers routing
   update.  But because the (portable) remote control goes to sleep just
   after the last communication, the routers cannot determine the

Internet-Draft   draft-brandt-rl2n-home-routing-reqs-01        July 2007


   location of the remote control by probing for it.

3.3.2.  Register lamp with central light controller; then place lamp

   In this scenario a central light controller controls all lamps in the
   house.  The new lamp module is powered within direct range of the
   light controller.  A discovery (potentially based on a broadcast-
   based protocol) makes the light controller discover the new module.
   The user sets up rules in the light controller for control of the
   lamp module.  Then the lamp module is placed at its final location.
   The lamp module being powered up at the final location causes routers
   to update routes.

3.3.3.  Register lamp outlet and wall switch with light controller

   In this scenario, a central light controller is still used to
   controls all lamps in the house.  It is practical to mount an outlet
   and get it registered at the same time.  The same applies to wall
   switches.  The wall switch may be out of direct range of the lamp
   module.  At least two scenarios can be envisioned:

3.3.3.1.  Installer controller used to set up rules

   A special portable controller is used to first discover the lamp
   outlet and the wall switch locally, i.e. within direct reach of their
   respective locations.  Then rules are set up in the light controller
   for the new lamp outlet and wall switch.  The lamp module being
   powered up at the final location triggers routing updates.

3.3.3.2.  Global discovery

   The lamp outlet and wall switch devices announce themselves to the
   network.  If already armed for an inclusion, routers carry the
   announcement to the light controller.  Then rules are set up in the
   light controller for the new lamp outlet and wall switch.  The lamp
   module being powered up at the final location triggers routing
   updates.

3.4.  Remote video surveillance

   Remote video surveillance is a fairly classic application for Home
   networking providing the ability for the end user to get a video
   stream from a Web Cam reached via the Internet, which can either be
   triggered by the end-user that has received an alarm from a movement
   sensor, smoke detector or that simply wants to check the home status
   via video.  Note that in the former case, more than likely, there
   will be a form of inter-device communication: indeed, upon detecting
   some movement in the home, the movement sensor may send a request to

Internet-Draft   draft-brandt-rl2n-home-routing-reqs-01        July 2007


   the light controller to turn-on the lights, to the Web Cam to start a
   video stream that would then be directed to the end user (cell phone,
   PDA) via the Internet.  By contrast with other application where for
   example a large number of L2N devices such as industrial sensors
   where the data would mainly be originated by sensor to a sink and
   vice versa, in such scenario there is a direct inter-device
   communication between L2N devices.

3.5.  Healthcare

   This section will be documented in further revision of this document.

3.6.  Alarm systems

   This section will be documented in further revision of this document.


4.  Unique requirements of home automation applications

   Home automation applications have a number of specific requirements
   related to the set of home networking applications and the perceived
   operation of the system.

4.1.  Support of groupcast

   Some home automation systems require low-level addressing of a group
   of nodes in the same subnet without any prior creation of multicast
   groups, simply carrying a list of recipients in the subnet.

   The routing protocol MUST support multicast routing with various
   scopes: local subnet, all devices.  In other words, the routing
   protocol MUST provide the ability to route a packet toward a single
   device (unicast), a set of devices (also referred to as "groupcast"
   in this document) or all devices (multicast) in the house.

   The support of unicast, groupcast and multicast also has an
   implication on the addressing scheme and are outside the scope of
   this document that focusses on the routing requirements aspects.

   Note: with IP Multicast, signalling mechanisms are used by a
   receivers to join a group and the sender does not necessarily know
   the receivers of the group.  What is required is the ability to
   address a group of receivers known by the sender even if the
   receivers do not need to know that they have been grouped by the
   sender (requesting each individual node to join a multicast group
   would be very impractical).

Internet-Draft   draft-brandt-rl2n-home-routing-reqs-01        July 2007


4.2.  Node constrained Routing

   Simple battery-powered nodes such as movement sensors on garage doors
   and rain meters may not be able to assist in routing.  Depending on
   the node type, the node never listens at all, listens rarely or makes
   contact on demand to a pre-configured target node.  Attempting to
   communicate to such nodes may require long time before getting a
   response.

   Other battery-powered node may have the capability to participate to
   the routing protocol but it may be preferable to choose a
   (potentially longer) route via non battery powered devices or via
   battery powered that have more energy.

   The routing protocol MUST support constained based routing taking
   into account node properties (CPU, memory, level of energy).

4.3.  Support of Mobility

   In a home environment, although the majority of devices are fixed
   devices, there is still a variety of mobile devices: for example a
   multi-purpose remote control is likely to move.  Another example of
   mobile devices is wearable healthcare devices.

   The routing protocol MUST provide mobility with convergence time
   within a few hundreds of milli-seconds.

4.4.  Scalability

   Looking at the number of wall switches, power outlets, sensor of
   various nature, video equipments and so on in a modern house, it
   seems quite realistic that hundreds low power devices may form a home
   automation network in a fully populated "smart" home.  Moving towards
   professional building automation, the number of such devices may be
   on the order of several thousands.

   Thus the routing protocol MUST be highly scalable supporting a large
   number of devices (at least a few hundreds of devices).

4.5.  Convergence Time

   Home automation is clearly an L2N subject to various instability due
   to signal strength variation.  Furthermore, as the number of (battery
   powered) devices increases, the probability of node failures also
   increases.  In all cases, response time of the order of a few
   hundreds of milliseconds are required, implying that the routing
   protocol MUST converge (provide alternate routes upon link or node
   failure) within a few hundreds of milliseconds.

Internet-Draft   draft-brandt-rl2n-home-routing-reqs-01        July 2007


4.6.  Delay Tolerant Networks

   TBD.

4.7.  Manageability

   The ability of the home network to support auto-configuration is of
   the utmost importance.  Indeed, most end users will not have the
   expertise and the skills to perform advanced configuration and
   troubleshooting.  Thus the routing protocol designed for home L2N
   MUST provide a set of features including 0 configuration of the
   routing protocol for a new node to be added to the network.

   Furthermore, a misbehaving node MUST NOT have a global impact on the
   routing protocol.  The routing protocol SHOULD support the ability to
   isolate a misbehaving node thus preserving the correct operation of
   overall network.


5.  Traffic pattern

   Depending on the philosophy of the home network, wall switches may be
   configured to directly control individual lamps or alternatively, all
   wall switches send control commands to a central lighting control
   computer which again sends out control commands to relevant light
   devices.  In a distributed system, the traffic tends to be any-to-
   many.  In a centralized system, it is a mix of any-to-one and one-to-
   many.

   A centralized system may benefit from a tree topology routing
   strategy; having the central light controller close to the root.

   A tree topology may prove inefficient for nodes in a distributed
   system.  A direct path from sender to receiver may be significantly
   shorter than a path following the tree.  A shorter path means lower
   latency and less air-time use in a wireless media.  Thus, routers
   MUST provide efficient any-to-many routing and MUST also support any-
   to-any routing without having to transit via a central point (e.g.
   tree root) which would unavoidably lead to sub-optimal path in term
   of latency and energy consumption.
