Requirements for Draft Tracking by the IETF Community in the Datatracker
              draft-ietf-genarea-datatracker-community-00

Abstract

   The document gives a set of requirements for extending the IETF
   Datatracker to give individual IETF community members, including the
   IETF leadership, easy methods for tracking the progress of the
   Internet Drafts of interest to them.

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on April 21, 2011.

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      October 2010


1.  Introduction

   IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a very early draft of a set of requirements.
   It has gone through no general community review, and thus probably is
   missing many things that should be included, and some of the things
   in this draft are wrong and will be changed in future drafts.
   Nothing in this draft should be considered solid.

   The IETF Datatracker is used by many IETF community members to find
   the status of Internet Drafts (I-Ds) and view drafts that meet
   particular criteria.  The current Datatracker, found at
   <https://datatracker.ietf.org/>, allows anyone to search for active
   I-Ds and get a list of drafts matching the given criteria.  (The
   Datatracker also allows for searching RFCs and expired I-Ds, but
   those are not relevant to this discussion.)

   Users can search in the Datatracker by the filename of the draft,
   words in the draft's title, author, associated Working Group (WG) or
   IETF area, the responsible Area Director (AD), or IESG status.  The
   returned list of drafts includes five columns: draft filename (with
   an active link to an HTMLized version of the draft maintained by the
   IETF tools team), the draft's title, the date it was submitted, its
   status in the IETF process, and the responsible AD (if any).  For
   example, the output of a search in the current Datatracker can be
   seen at <http://imgur.com/snfyl.png>.

   Instead of using the search capability of the Datatracker to manually
   find I-Ds of interest, users might want to create lists of drafts
   that they normally follow.  Different users in the IETF community
   will have different ways that they want to get information on draft
   updates and status.  Many users will want to be notified immediately,
   such as through an Atom feed (see [RFC4287]) or automatically-
   generated email.  Many users will want to only find out about updates
   when they go to a web page.  Many users might want to get the data
   for a list as input to other tools.  And, of course, some users will
   want all three.  All of these desires are related to the overall
   desire to track drafts through their lifecycle.

   For example, a WG chair might want to keep a list of all the drafts
   from other WGs that relate to active drafts in his or her WG.
   Someone who cares about the DNS probably also wants to follow the
   various drafts in different areas that affect the DNS.  Developers
   who are not active in the IETF process might want to follow drafts on
   a particular topic to watch for things that might affect their
   implementations.

   This document describes the requirements for extending the
   Datatracker for such capabilities.  When complete, this document may

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      October 2010


   be used to issue an RFP for the design and development of these
   enhancements to the Datatracker.  This document was prepared at the
   request of the IAOC.

   Note that [RFC2026] describes the process that Internet Drafts go
   through before they either become RFCs or are abandoned.  The
   Datatracker does not control this process: instead, it simply reports
   on the current state of individual drafts as they go through the
   process.

1.1.  Definitions Used in This Document

   o  A "user" is an individual person who is member of the IETF
      community.  (Yes, that definition is purposely vague.)

   o  A "list" is an unordered set of filenames of Internet Drafts.
      Lists are specified by users.

   o  An "attribute" is a feature of a draft, such as its filename, its
      current state in the IETF process, and so on.  Attributes are
      usually displayed as columns in the Datatracker.

   o  A "row" is a set of attributes about a single draft that is
      displayed in the Datatracker.

   o  A "significant change in status" is all approvals and disposition.
      In the current process for drafts in the IETF stream, "all
      approvals" means "publication requested" "in last call" (this is
      IETF last call, not WG last call), and "IESG evaluation";
      disposition is "approved" (for publication as an RFC), "RFC
      published", and "dead".

1.2.  Discussion of These Requirements

   [[ There is no mailing list for this draft at this time; one will
   hopefully appear before the next version of this draft. ]]

   There will be a BoF at IETF 79 in Beijing to discuss this draft.  It
   is currently being called "iddtspec", which somehow stands for
   "Review of Datatracker Specifications to Follow Internet-Draft
   Activities".

   There is a plan to have one or two virtual meetings after Beijing to
   discuss these requirements.

2.  Requirements for Tools Features

   This section defines the requirements for the tool described earlier
   in this document.  The eventual tool, if implemented, may have more
   features than are listed here; however, before this document is
   finished, it should contain as many requirements as possible upon
   which the IETF community can agree.

2.1.  Lists

2.1.1.  Requirement: Lists of drafts can be large

   An active IETF participant might want to follow the status of
   hundreds of drafts.  For example, some ADs have 100 drafts in their
   area, and they may also want to follow drafts outside their area that
   affect documents in their area.

2.1.2.  Requirement: A user can create multiple lists

   A user might have multiple areas of interest and would want to track
   each area on a different web page.  Another example would be a WG
   chair who wants to track the drafts in his or her WG separately from
   the drafts in a different area of interest.  An IETF participant
   might want to have a list of drafts that they are following closely,
   and another list of drafts written by work colleagues.

2.1.3.  Requirement: Some lists must be able to be private

   Seeing a list of drafts that covers multiple areas of interest can
   tell you something about the person who created the list.  For
   example, you might be able to guess that they might be looking for a
   job in a different field by looking at their list of drafts of
   interest.  Of course, anyone can follow individual drafts today
   without having that be exposed; however, following a particular group
   of drafts can reveal information about a person.

   Methods that might keep lists private include:

   o  The lists might only be available using passwords or some other
      common authentication mechanism.  This would require that the
      Datatracker have a subscription process for users that could
      assign passwords, and a per-user process for adding lists to a
      user account.

   o  Lists might be assigned random URLs from a very large (2^128)
      namespace, and the user who creates a list does not tell others
      the assigned URL.  This method makes it impossible for someone to
      search the entire set of assigned lists.  Given that the URLs for



Hoffman                  Expires April 21, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      October 2010


      lists are most likely going to be copy-and-pasted anyway, having
      long random strings in the list's URL is not an impediment.

   Note that some lists will purposely be made public, so there will be
   two types of lists.

2.1.4.  Requirement: Specifying the drafts that are in a list must be
        simple

   When a user creates a new list, it must be easy to add individual
   drafts to the list.  There needs to be a mechanism that searches for
   potential drafts by partial filename, by partial or full title, and
   by author.  Further, when editing an existing list, it must be easy
   to add additional drafts, and it must be easy to remove drafts from a
   list.

2.1.5.  Requirement: Adding groups of drafts to a list by attribute must
        be simple

   Drafts have many attributes, and some users might want to follow all
   of the drafts that have a particular attribute.  Some, but not all,
   attributes have values that make sense for creating lists.  It should
   be easy to add each of the following attributes when adding to or
   editing a list:

   o  All drafts associated with an individual WG

   o  All drafts associated with all WGs in an individual Area

   o  All drafts with a particular responsible AD

   o  All drafts with a particular author

   o  All drafts with a particular document shepherd

   o  All drafts that have a reference to a particular RFC

   o  All drafts that have a reference to a particular draft

   o  All drafts that are referenced by a particular RFC

   o  All drafts that are referenced by a particular draft

   o  All drafts that contain a particular text string

   These attributes are dynamic, and thus the list of drafts that have a
   particular attribute will change after the user adds that attribute
   to a list.  The Datatracker should update lists with dynamic



Hoffman                  Expires April 21, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      October 2010


   attributes every hour.

   Note that some of these attributes are derived by programs created by
   the IETF Tools Team that parse drafts and are therefore inherently
   not completely reliable.

2.1.6.  Requirement: Lists can dynamically include other lists

   If a user is authorized to see the contents of a list, he or she can
   include that other list in a different list.  When the referenced
   list changes, those changes are also reflected in the referring-to
   list; that is, if list A includes list B, and the set of drafts in
   list B changes, the set of drafts in list A is automatically changed.

   This feature is expected to be useful for experts (particularly WG
   chairs) who create lists on topics that others might consider
   interesting.  For example, if Alice creates a list that contains all
   the drafts that she thinks relate to TLS, and Bob has access to that
   list, Bob can add that list to his personal list of things for which
   he is interested.  Bob might also create a list-of-lists about TLS
   that includes references to Alice's list as well as to a similar list
   that Eric put together.

2.2.  Notifications

2.2.1.  Requirement: Users can be notified when a draft changes status

   Some users do not want to go to the Datatracker's display page to
   find out when a draft has been updated.  Instead, they want to be
   notified immediately after the draft is changed.  The Datatracker
   needs to support this type of immediate notification, where
   "immediate" means "within an hour of a change to any draft in the
   list".

2.2.2.  Requirement: Every list has Atom feeds associated with it

   The list will have two Atom feeds that are generated from the changes
   to the list: one for every change in status, and another for
   significant change of status.  Each Atom feed will have a stable URL
   that can be used by feed readers.

   Many IETF users are already using Atom feeds created by the IETF
   Tools Team for individual drafts.  Using the new feeds for lists
   described here will allow them to have better selection capabilities
   to reduce the number of feeds they need to follow.

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      October 2010


2.2.3.  Requirement: Every list has mail streams associated with it

   A user can subscribe to two email streams that are generated from the
   changes to the list: one for every change in status, and another for
   significant change of status.

2.2.4.  Requirement: Notifications need to specify which list caused the
        notification

   Users might have feeds and/or subscriptions to multiple lists.  In
   order to disambiguate duplicate notifications from multiple lists,
   the body of the message in the Atom feed or mail stream needs to say
   which list generated the notification.  (Ideally, a user who wants
   notifications will make one list based on multiple lists, but if they
   subscribe to multiple lists, this requirement will at least suggest
   to them that they want to limit their overlapping subscriptions.)

2.3.  Display in the Datatracker

   When a list is displayed to the user in the Datatracker's web
   interface, each row represents a single draft.  In a display, a
   particular draft should only included once; for example, if someone
   manually adds draft-ietf-cuteacronym-sometopic to his list and also
   specifies that all drafts from the "cuteacronym" WG are included in
   the list, that draft should only appear once in the display.

2.3.1.  Requirement: Users can define how the rows are sorted in a
        display

   There are many ways that a user might want to see the Datatracker's
   HTML view of a list.  For example, a user might want to normally see
   it in alphabetical order by the drafts' filenames, but after the user
   is of the net for a week, he or she might want to see the list in
   order of changes of status so that those drafts changed recently
   appear at the top of the list.

   When displaying a list, the Datatracker should allow easy sorting of
   the drafts with the following collation orders:

   o  Alphabetical by draft filename

   o  Alphabetical by draft title

   o  Alphabetical by associated WG

   o  Date of publication of current version of the draft





Hoffman                  Expires April 21, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      October 2010


   o  Date of most recent change of status of any type

   o  Date of most recent significant change of status

   The Datatracker should save the last-chosen sorting for display with
   the definition of the list.

2.3.2.  Requirement: Users can choose which attributes to display

   There are many attributes that might be displayed, and different
   users will have different information that they want to see.  Also,
   users will have different display technologies: someone might
   normally use a web browser on a large screen, but at other times use
   the browser on their phone.

   Choosing which attributes should be displayed should be simple for
   the user.  Also, the user should also be able to specify the order in
   which the attributes are displayed.  The Datatracker should save the
   last-chosen set of attributes for display with the definition of the
   list.

   The Datatracker should support display of the following attributes:

   o  Draft filename

   o  Draft title

   o  Date of current draft

   o  Status in the IETF process

   o  Associated WG

   o  Associated AD

   o  Changed within the last 1 day

   o  Changed within the last 2 days

   o  Changed within the last 7 days

   o  Included list(s) which contain this draft

   There is some leeway for how the Datatracker might display these
   attributes.  For example, the "changed within" attributes might be
   shown with a check mark or a colored box.  The "included lists"
   attribute might show a pop-up with the names of the lists, given that
   list names might be long.

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      October 2010


2.4.  File Output

2.4.1.  Requirement: Users can get their current list as a single file

   Some users have their own tools for displaying and otherwise
   processing lists of drafts.  To make this easier, users should be
   able to get a machine-parsable file that has a well-known format and
   syntax that contains all the data that was used to create the current
   display.  The order of the records in the file is not important
   because it is assumed that the user's program will sort the results
   themselves.  All attributes will be included because it is assumed
   that the user's programs will only deal with the ones the care about.

   When a list is marshaled into a data file, each record in the file
   format represents a single draft.  In a file, a particular draft is
   only included once; for example, if someone manually adds
   draft-ietf-cuteacronym-sometopic to his list and also specifies that
   all drafts from the "cuteacronym" WG are included in the list, that
   draft only appears once.

   This feature will allow anyone to create mash-ups of their own and
   create their own web sites based on the IETF data.  This is
   significantly easier than adding features to the Datatracker, and is
   able to cater to narrower audiences.

   The format of the file will be XML or JSON or tab-separated fields in
   a text file.  The decision on which format is supported will be based
   on the desires of the community while discussing this document.
   (Imagine how much fun that will be!)  Regardless of the format
   chosen, a syntax will need to be specified.


3.  IANA Considerations

   None.


4.  Security Considerations

   A tool for tracking the status of Internet Drafts can affect the
   privacy of its users.  The requirements for privacy of the
   Datatracker views are discussed earlier in the document.

   Web applications, particularly those that store data on a web server,
   are a common source of security issues such as cross-site scripting
   attacks.  The tool described in this document might also use access
   control for lists, and access control and authentication also cause
   security issues if not implemented properly.

Appendix A.  Some Known Open Issues

   Given the very early stage of this document, there are actually many
   more open issues than are listed here.  This list is mostly meant to
   remind the author of topics that need to be updated in future
   versions of the document, and to spur readers to think of even more
   open issues.  Many of these topic were offered before the -00 draft
   by early reviewers.

   o  One big feature that is desired is a way to say "tell me if this
      draft does not change state in the next nnn days".  This gives a
      "dashboard" style capability.  Doing this will mean holding more
      state on the Datatracker.

   o  People get confused about the states of non-IETF streams (IRTF,
      IAB, ISE).  These should be covered explicitly.  Also, need
      definitions of "significant change in status" for the three non-
      IETF streams.

   o  There will be an interesting and difficult interplay between
      privacy and sharing lists.  If someone shares a list, that person
      doesn't want anyone modifying the contents of the list.  So, there
      might need to be "sharing a shadow list" or something similar.

   o  There may be legal issues with keeping user data private if we use
      login accounts.

   o  Is there a formal definition for "drafts associated with a
      particular WG"?

   o  When an AD agrees to sponsor an individual submission, does the
      Datatracker consider that draft associated with the AD?  If not,
      that needs to be dealt with here.

   o  Should the file output be in all the interesting formats (XML and
      JSON and tab-separated text) or just one?

   o  As people coalesce on requirements for display, maybe mock up some
      HTML examples and put them in the document.

   o  Thought: add a button in the normal Datatracker output to add a
      particular draft to a particular list.

   o  How prescriptive do we want to be?  Should this say things like
      "JavaScript pop-up" and "CSS" and such?

   o  Should paging be supported for long lists in the HTML display?
