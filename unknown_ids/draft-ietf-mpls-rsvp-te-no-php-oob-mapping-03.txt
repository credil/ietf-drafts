   Abstract 

      There are many deployment scenarios which require Egress LSR to 
      receive binding of the RSVP-TE LSP to an application, and payload 
      identification, using some "out-of-band" (OOB) mechanism. This 
      document proposes protocol mechanisms to address this 
      requirement. The procedures described in this document are 
      equally applicable for point-to-point (P2P) and point-to-
      multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.

   1. Introduction 

      When RSVP-TE is used for applications like MVPN [MVPN] and VPLS 
      [VPLS], an Egress LSR receives the binding of the RSVP-TE LSP to 
      an application, and payload identification, using an "out-of-
      band" (OOB) mechanism (e.g., using BGP). In such cases, the 
      Egress LSR cannot make correct forwarding decision until such OOB 
      mapping information is received. Furthermore, in order to apply 
                        
                        
                       Expires August 2010                     [Page 2]

      the binding information, the Egress LSR needs to identify the 
      incoming LSP. Therefore, non Penultimate Hop Popping (non-PHP) 
      behavior is required at the Egress LSR to apply OOB mapping.  

      There are other applications that require non-PHP behavior. When 
      RSVP-TE P2MP LSPs are used to carry IP multicast traffic non-PHP 
      behavior enables a leaf LSR to identify the P2MP TE LSP, on which 
      traffic is received. Hence the egress LSR can determine whether 
      traffic is received on the expected P2MP LSP and discard traffic 
      that is not received on the expected P2MP LSP. Non-PHP behavior 
      is also required to determine the context of upstream assigned 
      labels when the context is a MPLS LSP. Non-PHP behavior may also 
      be required for MPLS-TP LSPs [MPLS-TP-Framework]. 
       
      This document defines two new flags in the Attributes Flags TLV 
      of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object defined in [RFC5420]: one flag for 
      communication of non-PHP behavior, and one flag to indicate that 
      the binding of the LSP to an application and payload identifier 
      (payload-Id) needs to be learned via an out-of-band mapping 
      mechanism.   

      The procedures described in this document are equally applicable 
      for P2P and P2MP LSPs. Specification of the OOB communication 
      mechanism(s) is beyond the scope of this document.  

   2. RSVP-TE signaling extensions 

      This section describes the signaling extensions required to 
      address the above-mentioned requirements.  

   2.1. Signaling non-PHP behavior 

      In order to request non-PHP behavior for RSVP-TE LSP, this 
      document defines a new flag in the Attributes Flags TLV of the 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object defined in [RFC5420]: 
       
      Bit Number 6 (TBD): non-PHP behavior desired flag.  

      In order to indicate to the Ingress LSR that the Egress LSR 
      recognizes the "non-PHP behavior desired flag", the following new 
      bit is defined in the Flags field of the Record Route object 
      (RRO) Attributes subobject:  
       
      Bit Number 6 (TBD): Non-PHP behavior acknowledgement flag. 


                        
                        
                       Expires August 2010                     [Page 3] 
       

  Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-rsvp-te-no-php-oob-mapping-03.txt 
       

      An Ingress LSR sets the non-PHP behavior desired flag to signal 
      the egress LSRs SHOULD assign non-NULL label for the LSP being 
      signaled.  This flag MUST NOT be modified by any other LSRs in 
      the network. LSRs other than the Egress LSRs SHOULD ignore this 
      flag.  
       
      If an egress LSR receiving the Path message, supports the 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and the Attributes Flags TLV, and also 
      recognizes the "non-PHP behavior desired flag", it MUST allocate 
      a non-NULL local label. The egress LSR MUST also set the "Non-PHP 
      behavior acknowledgement flag" in the Flags field of the RRO 
      Attribute subobject.  
       
      If the egress LSR supports the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object but does not 
      recognize the Attributes Flags TLV, or supports the TLV as well 
      but does not recognize this particular flag, then it SHOULD 
      simply ignore the above request. 

      An ingress LSR requesting non-PHP behavior MAY examine "Non-PHP 
      behavior acknowledgement flag" in the Flags field of the RRO 
      Attribute subobject and MAY send a Path Tear if the Egress 
      has not set the "Non-PHP behavior acknowledgement flag". An 
      ingress LSR requesting non-PHP behavior MAY also examine the 
      label value corresponding to the Egress LSR(s) in the RRO, and 
      MAY send a Path Tear if the Egress has assigns a Null label 
      value.  

   2.2. Signaling OOB Mapping Indication 

      This document defines a single flag to indicate that the normal 
      binding mechanism of an RSVP session is overridden.  The actual 
      out of band mappings are beyond the scope of this document.  The      
      flag is carried in the Attributes Flags TLV of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES 
      object defined in [RFC5420] and is defined as follows:  
       

      Bit Number 7 (TBD): OOB mapping indication flag.  

      In order to indicate to the Ingress LSR that the Egress LSR 
      recognizes the "OOB mapping indication flag", the following new 
      bit is defined in the Flags field of the Record Route object 
      (RRO) Attributes subobject:  
       
      Bit Number 7 (TBD): OOB mapping acknowledgement flag.  

       

                        
                        
                      Expires August 2010                     [Page 4] 
       
  Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-rsvp-te-no-php-oob-mapping-03.txt 
       

      An Ingress LSR sets the OOB mapping indication flag to signal the 
      Egress LSR that binding of RSVP-TE LSP to an application and 
      payload identification is being signaled out of band. This flag 
      MUST NOT be modified by any other LSRs in the network. LSRs other 
      than the Egress LSRs SHOULD ignore this flag.  
       
      When an egress LSR which supports the "OOB mapping indication 
      flag", receives a Path message with that flag set, the egress LSR 
      MUST set the "OOB mapping acknowledgement flag" in the Flags 
      field of the RRO Attribute subobject. The rest of the RSVP 
      signaling proceeds as normal.  However, the LSR MUST have 
      received the OOB mapping before accepting traffic on the LSP.  
      This implies that the egress LSR MUST NOT setup forwarding state 
      for the LSP before it receives the OOB mapping.  
       
      Note that the payload information SHOULD be supplied by the OOB 
      mapping. If the egress LSR receives the payload information from 
      OOB mapping then the LSR MUST ignore L3PID in the Label Request 
      Object [RFC3209]. 
    
      If the egress LSR supports the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object but does not 
      recognize the Attributes Flags TLV, or supports the TLV as well 
      but does not recognize this particular flag, then it SHOULD 
      simply ignore the above request.  

      An ingress LSR requesting OOB mapping MAY examine "OOB mapping 
      acknowledgement flag" in the Flags field of the RRO Attribute 
      subobject and MAY send a Path Tear to the Egress which has not 
      set the "OOB mapping acknowledgement flag".  

      In deploying applications where Egress LSR receives the binding 
      of the RSVP-TE LSP to an application, and payload identification, 
      using OOB mechanism, it is important to recognize that OOB 
      mapping is sent asynchronously w.r.t. signaling of RSVP-TE LSP.  
      Egress LSR only installs forwarding state for the LSP after it 
      receives the OOB mapping. In deploying applications using OOB 
      mechanism, ingress LSR may need to know when egress is properly 
      setup for forwarding (i.e., has received OOB mapping). How 
      ingress LSR determines that LSR is properly setup for forwarding 
      at the Egress LSR is beyond the scope of this document. 
      Nonetheless, if OOB mapping is not received by the egress LSR 
      within a reasonable time, a procedure to tear down the LSP is 
      defined in section 2.4.

   2.3. Relationship between OOB and non-PHP flags 

      Non-PHP behavior desired and OOB mapping indication flags can 
      appear and be processed independently of each other. However, as 
      mentioned earlier, in the context of application discussed in 
      this draft, OOB mapping require non-PHP behavior. An Ingress LSR 
      requesting OOB mapping MAY also set non-PHP behavior desired flag 
      in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object in the Path message.  

   2.4. Egress Procedure for label binding 

      RSVP-TE signaling completion and the OOB mapping information 
      reception happen asynchronously at the Egress. As mentioned in 
      Section 2, Egress waits for the OOB mapping before accepting 
      traffic on the LSP.  

      In order to avoid unnecessary use of the resources and possible 
      block-holing of traffic, if the OOB mapping information is not 
      received within a reasonable time, Egress MAY trigger a Path 
      Error message with the error code/sub-code "Notify Error/ no OOB 
      mapping received" for all affected LSPs. If available, and where 
      notify requests were included when the LSPs were initially setup, 
      Notify messages (as defined in [RFC3473]) MAY also be used for 
      delivery of this information to the Ingress LSR. An Egress LSR 
      MAY implement a cleanup timer for this purpose. The time-out 
      value is a local decision at the Egress, with a RECOMMENDED 
      default value of 60 seconds.  

   3. Security Considerations 

      This document does not introduce any new security issues above 
      those identified in [RFC3209], [RFC5420] and [RFC4875]. 

    
   4. IANA Considerations 

   4.1. Attribute Flags for LSP_ATTRIBUTES object 

      The following new flags are being defined for the Attributes 
      Flags TLV in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object.  The numeric values are 
      to be assigned by IANA. 

      o  Non-PHP behavior desired flag - Bit Number 6 (Suggested 
         value). 

      o  OOB mapping indication flag - Bit Number 7 (Suggested value). 

                        
                        
                      Expires August 2010                     [Page 6] 

 
  Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-rsvp-te-no-php-oob-mapping-03.txt 
       

      These flags are only to be used in the Attributes Flags TLV on a 
      Path message. These flags have corresponding new flags to be used 
      in the RRO Attributes subobject. As per RFC5420 [RFC5420], the 
      bit numbering in the Attribute Flags TLV and the RRO Attributes 
      subobject is identical.  That is, the same attribute is indicated 
      by the same bit in both places.  Specifically, the numeric values 
      for the corresponding new flags to be used in the RRO Attributes 
      subobject are to be assigned by IANA.   

      o  OOB mapping acknowledgement flag - Bit Number 6 (Suggested 
         value). 

      o  Non-PHP behavior acknowledgement flag - Bit Number 7 
         (Suggested value). 

      For Error Code = 25 "Notify Error" (see [RFC3209]) the following 
      sub-code is defined. 
       
            Sub-code                    Value 
            --------                    ----- 
       
            No OOB mapping received     12 (TBD)
