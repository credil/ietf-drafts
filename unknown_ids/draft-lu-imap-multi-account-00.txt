Internet-Draft      IMAP4 Multi-Account Commands             June 2011 
        

   This document specifies the syntax of LISTA and SELECTA commands for 
   the Internet Message Access Protocol [RFC3501]. With LISTA command, a 
   client can obtain a list of all the accounts authenticated for the 
   user. With SELECTA command, a client can select one of the user's 
   authenticated accounts and then gain access to all the mailboxes 
   belonging to that account, without having to log out of the current 
   account.

1. Introduction 

   In practice, it's often desirable for a user to exchange information 
   among his/her multiple email accounts. However, according to the 
   current Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) 
   [RFC3501], if a user needs to access an account after he/she has been 
   authenticated for a different one, he/she has to first log out of the 
   current account and then be re-authenticated for the desired account. 
   This document introduces  LISTA and SELECTA commands as extensions of 
   the IMAP4rev1 protocol. With LISTA command, a client can obtain a 
   list of all the authenticated accounts bound to a certain account. 
   With SELECTA command, a client, in an authenticated state, can shift 
   easily from one account to another associated account for which the 
   client has also been authenticated. Before implementing this command, 
   it is assumed that the client has already been authenticated for 
   multiple associated accounts. The purpose of this SELECTA command is 
   to allow the client to select one of those associated accounts and 
   access its mailboxes or folders without having to log out of the 
   current account and re-log into the desired one. 

2. Conventions used in this document 

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively.

Internet-Draft      IMAP4 Multi-Account Commands             June 2011 
        

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].  

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be    
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance. 

3. Authentication for Associated Accounts 

   When a client is attempting to be authenticated for a certain 
   account, the server SHOULD check that client's registration profile 
   to find out whether or not there are any other accounts associated
   with that account. If the client is authenticated successfully for 
   that certain account, it SHOULD also be authenticated automatically 
   for all those associated accounts if present. 

4. Specification 

   LISTA Command 

   Arguments:  account identifier 

   Responses:  no specific responses for this command 

   Result:     OK - lista completed 
               NO - lista failure: account identifier rejected 
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid 

   The LISTA command SHALL be implemented when the connection is in the 
   authenticated state. The LISTA command returns a list of all the 
   authenticated accounts bound to the one given as the argument. An OK 
   response represents a valid listing.  

   Example:    C: A001 LISTA bob1@abcd.com 
               S: * 2 EXISTS 
               S: * LISTA bob1@abcd.com 
               S: * LISTA bob2@defg.com 
               S: A001 OK LISTA completed 
        

   SELECTA Command 

   Arguments:  account identifier 

   Responses:  no specific responses for this command

Internet-Draft      IMAP4 Multi-Account Commands             June 2011 
        

   Result:     OK - selecta completed 
               NO - selecta failure: account identifier rejected 
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid 

   The SELECTA command SHALL be implemented when the connection is in 
   the authenticated state. The SELECTA command selects one of the 
   accounts that the client has been authenticated for, as an active 
   account. An OK response represents a valid selection and the 
   succeeding operations are performed with respect to the selected 
   message account. For instance, a SELECT command following a SELECTA 
   command means the selection of a mailbox belonging to the account 
   chosen by the SELECTA command. 

   Example:    C: A140 SELECTA bob1@abcd.com 
               S: A140 OK SELECTA completed 
               C: A141 SELECT INBOX 
               S: * 172 EXISTS 
               S: * 1 RECENT 
               S: * OK [UNSEEN 12] Message 12 is first unseen 
               S: * OK [UIDVALIDITY 3857529045] UIDs valid 
               S: * OK [UIDNEXT 4392] Predicted next UID 
               S: * FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft) 
               S: * OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Deleted \Seen \*)] Limited 
               S: A141 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed 
               (The mailbox "INBOX" belonging to the account  
               "bob1@abcd.com" has been selected.)

   There are no known security issues with this extension.
