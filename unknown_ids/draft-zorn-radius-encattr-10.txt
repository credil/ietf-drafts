Internet-Draft            Encrypted Attributes             February 2008


1.  Introduction

   Certain applications of the RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] require that
   the content (at least, if not the type and length) of one or more
   Attributes in a message be encrypted.  For example, an application
   enabling the interception of certain packets by law enforcement
   agencies might require that it be impossible for an observer to
   distinguish between sessions which are under surveillance and those
   that are not.  If packet interception is enabled and disabled using
   RADIUS (via the Access-Accept [RFC2865] or CoA-Request [RFC5176]
   messages, for example) then the Attributes used to signal this must
   be encrypted; however, it might be acceptable for the remainder of
   the Attributes to be sent in cleartext.

   Currently, this type of transfer is usually accomplished using either
   the Tunnel-Password Attribute [RFC2868] or vendor-specific RADIUS
   attributes.  However, there are several issues with these techniques:

   o  The Tunnel-Password Attribute was not designed to carry entire
      RADIUS Attributes and it is not large enough to hold an Attribute
      of the maximum size

   o  The security properties and strength of the encryption method used
      to hide the contents of the Tunnel-Password Attribute are unknown

   o  Due to its dependency upon the random Request Authenticator in the
      Access-Request message [RFC2865], the Tunnel-Password Attribute
      cannot be used in messages other than Access-Accept

   o  Although vendor-specific Attributes may not share the problems
      outlined above, a profusion of different attributes used for the
      same purpose entails considerable multiplication of effort and
      makes interoperability difficult to achieve

   This document defines RADIUS Attributes that can be used to
   encapsulate and confidentially transfer one or more RADIUS Attributes
   using non-proprietary techniques with well-understood security
   properties.  In addition, the Message-Authentication-Code Attribute
   may be used to provide strong authentication for any RADIUS message,
   including those used for accounting and dynamic authorization.

   Discussion of this draft may be directed to the authors.

Internet-Draft            Encrypted Attributes             February 2008


   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Attributes

   The following subsections describe the Attributes defined by this
   document.  This specification concerns the following values:

      <TBD1> Crypto-Params

      <TBD2> Encrypted-Attribute

      <TBD3> Message-Authentication-Code

      <TBD4> MAC-Randomizer

3.1.  Crypto-Params

   Description

      This Attribute is used to carry data used during the encryption
      and decryption of the Attribute(s) encapsulated in the Encrypted-
      Attribute Attribute, specifically the initialization vector and
      algorithm identifier.

      Any packet that contains an Crypto-Params Attribute MUST also
      contain a Message-Authentication-Code Attribute (Section 3.3) and
      SHOULD contain one or more instances of the Encrypted-Attribute
      Attribute (Section 3.2).

      A summary of the Crypto-Params attribute format is shown below.
      The fields are transmitted from left to right.

Internet-Draft            Encrypted Attributes             February 2008




      Type

         <TBD1> for Crypto-Params

      Length

         >=19

      Enc Type

         The Enc Type field is 1 octet in length and serves to identify
         the encryption algorithm in use.  This document defines the
         following decimal values for this field:

            0 NULL

            1 AES-CBC-128 [FIPS-197-2001]

            2 AES-CBC-192 [FIPS-197-2001]

            3 AES-CBC-256 [FIPS-197-2001]

         Implementations MUST support Enc Types 0 and 1 (NULL and AES-
         CBC-128).  Other values are to be assigned by IANA.

      Key ID

         The Key ID field is 16 octets in length and contains an
         identifier for the key used to encrypt and decrypt the String
         field of the Encrypted-Attribute Attribute (Section 3.2).
         Further specification of the content of this field is outside
         the scope of this document.

      IV

         The IV field is variable length and contains the initialization
         vector.  The length of the IV field depends upon the algorithm
         specified in the Enc Type field (above); for the algorithms
         defined in this document, the length of the IV field is 16
         octets.  If no initialization vector is required by the
         algorithm specified by the Enc Type field, this field MAY be
         omitted.

Internet-Draft            Encrypted Attributes             February 2008


3.2.  Encrypted-Attribute

   Description

      This Attribute MAY be used to carry one or more encrypted
      Attributes in a RADIUS message.

      Any packet that contains an Encrypted-Attribute Attribute MUST
      also include both a Crypto-Params Attribute (Section 3.1) and a
      Message-Authentication-Code (Section 3.3) Attribute.

      The encryption of the Attribute(s) MUST be performed by the sender
      according to the following algorithm:

         Concatenate the Attributes to be encrypted.  If the algorithm
         specified by the Enc Type field of the Crypto-Params Attribute
         is a block cipher and the length in octets of the result is not
         an even multiple of the algorithm's block size , pad the result
         of the concatenation on the right with enough zero-value octets
         to make the resulting string an even multiple of the block size
         in length.  Encrypt the result using the algorithm specified by
         the Enc Type field and the initialization vector contained in
         the IV field of the Crypto-Params Attribute (Section 3.1).
         Split the resulting ciphertext into one or more chunks, each <=
         253 octets in length.  Encapsulate each chunk in a separate
         instance of the Encrypted-Attribute Attribute.

      The receiver MUST recover the plaintext Attribute(s) using the
      following algorithm:

         Concatenate the String fields of the received Encrypted-
         Attribute Attributes in order of reception.  Decrypt the result
         using the algorithm specified in the Enc Type field and the
         initialization vector contained in the IV field of the Crypto-
         Params Attribute (Section 3.1).  Split the resulting cleartext
         in to Attributes, discarding the padding (if any).

      A subset of the attributes in a message can be authenticated and
      integrity-protected by setting the Enc Type field in the Crypto-
      Params Attribute (Section 3.1) to NULL and concatenating an
      instance of the Message-Authentication-Code Attribute to the set
      of attributes to be protected.  When used in this way, only the
      attributes to be protected are to be used as input in the creation
      of the Message-Authentication-Code Attribute.

      The Encrypted-Attribute Attribute MUST NOT be used to transfer
      keys between RADIUS servers and clients.

      Type

         <TBD2> for Encrypted-Attribute

      Length

         >=3

      String

         The String field is variable length and contains the actual
         encrypted Attributes (see above).

3.3.  Message-Authentication-Code

   Description

      This Attribute MAY be used to "sign" messages to prevent spoofing
      If it is present in a request, the receiver should take this a
      hint that the sender prefers the use of this Attribute for message
      authentication; the receiver is not obligated to do so, however.

      The Message-Authentication-Code Attribute MUST be included in any
      message that contains a Key attribute.

      Any packet that contains an instance of the Message-
      Authentication-Code Attribute SHOULD NOT contain an instance of
      the Message-Authenticator Attribute [RFC3579].  If both attributes
      are to be included in a message (e.g., for backward compatibility
      in a network containing both old and new clients), the value of
      the Message-Authentication-Code Attribute MUST be computed first.

      If any message is received containing an instance of the Message-
      Authentication-Code Attribute, the receiver MUST calculate the
      correct value of the Message-Authentication-Code and silently
      discard the packet if the computed value does not match the value

      received.

      If a received message contains an instance of the MAC-Randomizer
      Attribute (Section 3.4), the received MAC-Randomizer Attribute
      SHOULD be included in the computation of the Message-
      Authentication-Code Attribute sent in the response, as described
      below.

      A summary of the Message-Authentication-Code attribute format is
      shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

         This field is reserved for future usage and MUST be zero-
         filled.

      MAC Type

         The MAC Type field specifies the algorithm used to create the
         value in the MAC field.  This document defines six values for
         the MAC Type field:

            0 HMAC-SHA-1 [FIPS.180-2.2002] [RFC2104]

            1 HMAC-SHA-256 [FIPS.180-2.2002] [RFC4231]

            2 HMAC-SHA-512 [FIPS.180-2.2002] [RFC4231]

            3 CMAC-AES-128 [NIST.SP800-38B]

            4 CMAC-AES-192 [NIST.SP800-38B]

            5 CMAC-AES-256 [NIST.SP800-38B]

         Implementations MUST support MAC Type 0 (HMAC-SHA-1); other
         values are to be assigned by IANA.

      MAC Key ID

         The MAC Key ID field is 16 octets in length and contains an
         identifier for the key.  The MAC Key ID MUST refer to a key of
         a type and length appropriate for use with the algorithm
         specified by the MAC Type field (see above).  Further
         specification of the content of this field is outside the scope
         of this document.

      MAC

         Both the length and value of the MAC field depend upon the
         algorithm specified by the value of the MAC Type field.  If the
         algorithm specified is HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256 or HMAC-SHA-
         512, the MAC field MUST be 20, 32 or 64 octets in length,
         respectively.  If the algorithm specified is CMAC-AES-128,
         CMAC-AES-192 or CMAC-AES-256, the MAC field SHOULD be 64 octets
         in length.  The derivation of the MAC field value for all the
         algorithms specified in this document is identical, except for
         the algorithm used.  There are differences, however, depending
         upon whether the MAC is being computed for a request message or
         a response.  These differences are detailed below, with the
         free variable HASH-ALG representing the actual algorithm used.

         Request Messages

            For requests (e.g., CoA-Request [RFC5176], Accounting-
            Request [RFC2866], etc.), the value of the MAC field is a
            hash of the entire packet except the Request Authenticator
            in the header of the RADIUS packet, using a shared secret as
            the key, as follows.

            MAC = MAC-ALG(Key, Type + Identifier + Length + Attributes)
            where '+' represents concatenation

            The MAC-Randomizer Attribute (Section 3.4) MUST be included
            in any request in which the Message-Authentication-Code
            Attribute is used.  The Random field of the MAC-Randomizer
            Attribute MUST be filled in before the value of the MAC
            field is computed.

            If the Message-Authenticator-Code Attribute is included in a
            client request, the server SHOULD ignore the contents of the
            Request Authenticator.

            Implementation Notes

               When the hash is calculated, both the MAC field of the
               Message-Authenticator-Code attribute and the String field
               of the Message-Authenticator Attribute (if any) MUST be
               considered to be zero-filled.

               Implementations SHOULD provide a means to provision a key
               (cryptographically separate from the normal RADIUS shared
               secret) to be used exclusively in the generation of the
               Message-Authentication-Code.

         Response Messages

            For responses (e.g., CoA-ACK [RFC5176], Accounting-Response
            [RFC2866], etc.), the value of the MAC field is a hash of
            the entire packet except the Response Authenticator in the
            header of the RADIUS packet using a shared secret as the
            key, as follows.

            MAC = HASH-ALG(Key, Type + Identifier + Length + Attributes)
            where '+ ' represents concateation

            If the request contained an instance of the MAC-Randomizer
            Attribute and the responder wishes to include an instance of
            the Message-Authentication-Code Attribute in the
            corresponding response, then the MAC-Randomizer Attribute
            from the request MUST be included in the response.

            If the Message-Authenticator-Code Attribute is included in a
            server response, the client SHOULD ignore the contents of
            the Response Authenticator.

            Implementation Notes

               When the hash is calculated, both the MAC field of the
               Message-Authenticator-Code attribute and the String field
               of the Message-Authenticator Attribute (if any) MUST be
               considered to be zero-filled.

               The Message-Authentication-Code Attribute MUST be created
               and inserted in the packet before the Response
               Authenticator is calculated.

               Implementations SHOULD provide a means to provision a key
               (cryptographically separate from the normal RADIUS shared
               secret) to be used exclusively in the generation of the
               Message-Authentication-Code.

3.4.  MAC-Randomizer

   Description

      The MAC-Randomizer Attribute MUST be present in any message that
      includes an instance of the Message-Authentication-Code Attribute.
      The Random field MUST contain a 32 octet random number which
      SHOULD satisfy the requirements of [RFC4086].

      Implementation Note

         The Random field MUST be filled in before the MAC is computed.
         The MAC-Randomizer Attribute SHOULD be placed at the beginning
         of the RADIUS message if possible.

      A summary of the MAC-Randomizer attribute format is shown below.
      The fields are transmitted from left to right.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section explains the criteria to be used by the IANA for
   assignment of numbers within namespaces defined within this document.
   The "Specification Required" policy is used here with the meaning
   defined in BCP 26 [RFC2434].

4.1.  Attribute Types

   Upon publication of this document as an RFC, IANA must assign numbers
   to the Crypto-Params, Encrypted-Attribute, MAC-Randomizer and
   Message-Authentication-Code Attributes.

4.2.  Attribute Values

   As defined in Section 3.1, numbers may need to be assigned for future
   values of the Enc Type field of the Crypto-Params attribute.  These
   numbers may be assigned by applying the "Specification Required"
   policy.

   As defined in Section 3.3, numbers may need to be assigned for future
   values of the MAC Type field of the Message-Authentication-Code
   attribute.  These numbers may be assigned by applying the
   "Specification Required" policy.


5.  Security Considerations

   Although the encryption algorithms specified in this document are
   believed to be strong, ultimately the confidentiality of the
   encrypted attributes depends upon the strength of the keys used to
   encrypt them.  For this reason, implementations SHOULD use keys with
   entropy equal to or greater than the strength of the algorithm used
   (e.g., 128 bits of entropy for AES-CBC-128, etc.).

   Given that the secret shared between RADIUS clients and servers
   typically has relatively weak entropy, it is NOT RECOMMENDED that
   implementations use the shared secret (or a derivative thereof) as a

   key for attribute encryption.

   To avoid the possibility of collisions, the same MAC key SHOULD NOT
   be used with more than 2^(n/2) messages, where 'n' is the length of
   the MAC value in octets.
