        OPEN ISSUES: 
         
        1. Length and format of PowerMonitorId. The pmPowerMonitorID 
          should be a unique id that identfies the device in the 
          universe. A UUID using RFC 4122 seems to suffice. However an 
          x.509 certificate conforming to RFC 5280 could also be 
          appropriate. We have specified the field as variable 16 bytes 
          but would like feedback and consensus on the format that is 
          appropriate.  
        2. Do we want separate tables, as depicted in figure 1, as 
          opposed to a single pmTable?  
        3. Should the pmMgmtMacAddress, pmMgmtAddress, 
          pmMgmtAddressType, and pmMgmtDNSName also be implemented for 
          Power Monitor Parent?   
                                                                            
         
         
     1. Introduction 

        The EMAN standards provides network administrators with energy 
        management. This document defines a subset of the Management 
        Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols 
        for power and energy monitoring of network devices and devices 
        attached to the network, as specified in the Power Management 
        Architecture [EMAN-FMWK], which in turn, is based on the Power 
        Monitoring Requirements [EMAN-REQ]. 
         
        This module's special focus is on monitoring energy-aware 
        networks and devices.  The module addresses device 
        identification, context information, and relationships between 
        reporting devices, remote devices, and monitoring probes. 
      
        Devices and their sub-components may be characterized by the 
        power-related attributes of a physical entity present in the 
        ENTITY MIB [RFC4133], even though ENTITY MIB compliance is not a

        requirement due to the variety and broad base of devices 
        concerned with energy management. 
         
     1.1. Energy Management Document Overview 

        This document, which specifies the Energy-aware Networks and 
        Devices MIB document is based on the Energy Management Framework 
        [EMAN-FMWK], per the Energy Management requirements specified in 
        [EMAN-REQ], which allows networks and devices to become energy 
        aware. 
                           
        The Power and Energy Monitoring MIB [EMAN-MON-MIB] contains the  
        managed objects for monitoring of power states and energy 
        consumption/production.  The monitoring of power states 
        includes: retrieving power states, properties of power states, 
        current power state, power state transitions, and power state 
        statistics. This MIB provides the detailed properties of the 
        actual energy rate (power) and of accumulated energy, along with 
        the power quality. 
         
        The applicability statement document [EMAN-AS] provides the list 
        of use cases, cross-reference between existing standards and the 
        EMAN standard, and shows how the EMAN framework relates to other 
        frameworks. 
           
        EDITOR'S NOTE: [EMAN-MON-MIB] and [EMAN-AS] are not EMAN working 
        group documents.  Hence, these references will be changed in the 
        future. 
         
         
     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
        current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
        section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant with  
        SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, 
        RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

     3. Use Cases 

        Requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking 
        devices are specified in [EMAN-REQ].  The requirements in [EMAN-
        REQ] cover devices typically found in communications networks, 
        such as switches, routers, and various connected endpoints.  For 
        a power monitoring architecture to be useful, it should also 
        apply to facility meters, power distribution units, gateway 
        proxies for commercial building control, home automation 
        devices, and devices that interface with the utility and/or 
        smart grid.  Accordingly, the scope of the MIB modules in this 
        document is broader than that specified in [EMAN-REQ]. 
         
         
     4. Terminology 

       The definitions of basic terms like Energy Management, Energy 
       Monitoring, "Power, Energy, and Energy Consumption", Power 
       Monitor, Power Monitor Parent, Power Monitor Child, Power 
       Monitor Meter Domain, Power Level, and Manufacturer Power Level, 
       Nameplate Power, Power Proxy, Power Aggregator, Power 
       Distributor can be found in the Power Management Architecture 
       [EMAN-FMWK]. 
        
       EDITOR'S NOTE: not sure if all terms will be used in the final 
       version of the draft 
        
       EDITOR'S NOTE: [EMAN-FMWK] is an informational non normative 
       reference. Is this fine? 
        
        
     5. Architecture Concepts Applied to the MIB Module 

        This section describes the basic concepts specified in the Power 
        Monitor Architecture [EMAN-FMWK], with specific information 
        related to the MIB module specified in this document   
      
        The following diagram shows the relationship of the identifying 
        information.

        As displayed in figure 1, there are four different types of MIB 
        objects in the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module: 
         
        1) The Power Monitor Information. See Section 5.1 Power Monitor 
          Information

        2) The links to other MIB modules. See Section 5.2 Links to 
          other MIB Modules  
        3) The Power Monitor Child specific information. See Section 5.3 
          Power Monitor Parent and Child 
        4) The Context Information. See Section 5.4 Power Monitor 
          Context 
         
         
     5.1 Power Monitor Information    

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Information" section in [EMAN-FMWK] 
        for background information.  An energy aware device is 
        considered an instance of a Power Monitor as defined in the 
        [EMAN-FMWK]. 
         
        The Power Monitor information is specified in the MIB module 
        pmTable table.  Every Power Monitor and MUST HAVE a unique Power 
        Monitor index pmIndex. 
        The pmIndex is a unique index greater than zero for each Power 
        Monitor.  It is recommended that values be assigned sequentially 
        starting from 1.   

        The pmIndex is completed by the Power Monitor Universally Unique 
        Identifier [RFC4122] in the pmPowerMonitorId MIB object.                      

         
     5.1.1. Power Monitor Name 

        Every Power Monitor SHOULD have a printable name pmName. 
        Possible pmName conventions are: textual DNS name, MAC-address 
        of the device, interface ifName, or a text string uniquely 
        identifying the Power Monitor.  However, if entPhysicalName is 
        present for the respective pmPhysicalEntity (i.e. if the ENTITY-
        MIB [RFC4133] is supported), then the pmName SHOULD be identical 
        to the entPhysicalName.  The pmName SHOULD be unique in the 
        Power Monitor Meter Domain.  As an example, in the case of IP 
        phones, pmName can be the device DNS name, while in the case of 
        router/switch line cards, the pmName should contain the 
        entPhysicalName.   
         
     To distinguish if a Power Monitor is considered producing,

     5.1.2. Power Monitor Meter Domain 

         
        Refer to the "Power Monitor Meter Domain" section in [EMAN-FMWK] 
        for background information. 
      
        When a Power Monitor Parent acts as a Power Aggregator or a 
        Power Proxy, the Power Monitor Parent and its Power Monitor 
        Child/Children MUST be a member of Power Monitor Meter Domain, 
        specified by the pmDomainName MIB Object.  The pmDomainName, 
        which is part of the pmTable, is a read-write MIB object.  Note 
        that the Power Monitor MUST belong to a single Power Monitor 
        Meter Domain. 
         
        The Power Monitor Meter Domain SHOULD map 1-1 with a metered or 
        sub-metered portion of the site.  The Power Monitor Meter Domain 
        MUST be configured on the Power Monitor Parent.  The Power 
        Monitor Children MAY inherit their domain values from the Power 
        Monitor Parent or the Power Monitor Meter Domain MAY be 
        configured directly in a Power Monitor Child.  
      

     5.1.3. Alternate Key 

        The pmAlternateKey object specifies a manufacturer defined 
        string that can be used to identify the Power Monitor. Since 
        Energy Management Systems (EMS) and Network Management Systems 
        (NMS) may need to correlate objects across management systems, 
        this alternate key is provided to provide such a link. This 
        optional value is intended as a foreign key or alternate 
        identifier for a manufacturer or EMS/NMS to use to correlate the 
        unique Power Monitor Id in other systems or namespaces. If an 
        alternate key is not available or is not applicable then NULL 
        should be returned. 
      

     5.1.4. Persistence 

         
        In some situations, the Power Monitor information should be 
        persistent across a reload.  For example, in a static setup 
        where a switch monitors a series of connected PoE phones, there 
        is a clear benefit for the NMS if the pmIndex and all associated 
        information persist, as it saves a network discovery.  However, 
        in other situations, such as a wireless access point monitoring 
        the mobile user PCs, there is not much advantage to persist the 
        Power Monitor Information. Therefore, a specific MIB object, the 
        pmTablePersistence, enables and disables the persistence

        globally for all Power Monitors information in the ENERGY-AWARE-
        MIB MIB module. 

     5.2 Links to other MIB Modules 

         
        The Power Monitor MUST contain the entityPhysicalIndex from the 
        ENTITY MIB [RFC4133] in the pmPhysicalEntity, if supported by 
        the Power Monitor.  In case of Power over Ethernet (if the Power 
        over Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported on the Power Monitor), 
        the Power Monitor pmethPortIndex and pmethPortGrpIndex MUST 
        contain the values of pethPsePortIndex and 
        pethPsePortGroupIndex, respectively.  In case of LLDP-MED (if 
        the LLDP-MED MIB is supported on the Power Monitor), the Power 
        Monitor pmLldpPortNumber MUST contain the lldpLocPortNum from 
        the LLDP MIB [LLDP-MIB].    
         
         
     5.3 Power Monitor Parent and Child 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Parent and Child" section in [EMAN-
        FMWK] for background information.  In order to link the Power 
        Monitor Child and the Power Monitor Parent, the pmParentId is 
        introduced.  
         
        The pmParentId, pmParentProxyAbilities, pmMgmtMacAddress, 
        pmMgmtAddress, pmMgmtAddressType, and pmMgmtDNSName MIB objects 
        are specific to Power Monitor Children. 
         
        The Power Monitor Child MUST set the pmParentId content to its 
        Power Monitor Parent pmIndex.  In the case of Power Monitor 
        Parent, the pmParentId MUST be set to the null string 
         
        The Power Monitor Child can indicate that it wants its Power 
        Monitor Parent to proxy capabilities such as, energy reporting, 
        power state configurations, non physical wake capabilities (such 
        as WoL)), or any combination of capabilities. These capalities 
        are indicated in the pmPArentProxyAbilities object. In the case 
        of Power Monitor Parent, the pmParentProxyAbilities MUST be set 
        to "none" (0). 
         
        Since the communication between the Power Monitor Parent and 
        Power Monitor Child is out of the scope, a Power Monitor Child 
        can have additional objects used for easier identification by 
        the NMS: IP Address and DNS name.   The MAC address is also 
        provided as a way to identify the Power Monitor Child: this 
        information is required, among other use case, by the wake on 
        lan feature.

       5.4 Power Monitor Context 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Context" section in [EMAN-FMWK] for 
        background information. 
         
        A Power Monitor can provide a pmImportance value in the range of 
        1..100 to help differentiate the use or relative value of the 
        device.  The importance range is from 1 (least important) to 100 
        (most important).  The default importance value is 1.   
      
        A Power Monitor can provide a set of pmKeywords.  These keywords 
        are a list of tags that can be used for grouping and summary 
        reporting within or between Power Monitor Meter Domains. 
         
        Additionally, a Power Monitor can provide a pmRoleDescription 
        string that indicates the purpose the Power Monitor serves in 
        the network or for the site/business. 
         
     6. Structure of the MIB 

        The primary MIB object in this MIB module is the 
        EnergyAwareDeviceMIBObject.  The pmTable table of 
        EnergyAwareDeviceMIBObject describes an entity in the network 
        that is a Power Monitor according the [EMAN-FMWK]. 

        A Power Monitor that implements the EnergyAwareDeviceMIB 
        contains information describing itself as an entity in the 
        context of the network (such as its Power Monitor Meter Domain 
        pmDomainName) and attributes for describing its business context 
        (such as pmImportance, pmRoleDescription and pmKeywords).  

        The information in this MIB describes the device itself so that 
        the device is aware of its context in a communication network 
        with respect to power.  The actual power usage, which is 
        described in [EMAN-FMWK], is specified in [EMAN-MON-MIB].

     8. Security Considerations  

        Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
      
      
     <Parello, Claise>     Expires September 10, 2011         [Page 23] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Energy-aware Networks and Devices MIB> Mar. 2011 
      
        thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these 
        objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects 
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.   
         
        There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB 
        modules with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
        create.  Such objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable 
        in some network environments.  The support for SET operations in 
        a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
        negative effect on network operations.  The following are the 
        tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         
          . Unauthorized changes to the pmDomainName, pmName, 
             pmRoleDescription, pmKeywords, and/or pmImportance MAY 
             disrupt power and energy collection, and therefore any 
             predefined policies defined in the network. 
         
      
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using 
        IPsec), there is still no secure control over who on the secure 
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB modules. 
         
         
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 
         
         
     9. IANA Considerations 

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
         
          Descriptor                         OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
          ----------                         -----------------------

        Additions to this MIB module are subject to Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested MIB objects for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description.  Requests for MIB objects that duplicate the 
        functionality of existing objects SHOULD be declined.  The 
        smallest available OID SHOULD be assigned to a new MIB objects.  
        The specification of new MIB objects SHOULD follow the structure 
        specified in Section 6 and MUST be published using a well-
        established and persistent publication medium.
