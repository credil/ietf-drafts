Internet-Draft                 HTTP Prefer                 December 2011


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a new HTTP request header field that may
   be used by clients to request optional behaviors be applied by a
   server during the processing the request.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.1.  Syntax Notation

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234] and includes, by reference, the "token",
   "quoted-string", "OWS", "BWS" rules and the #rule extension as
   defined within [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging] Section 1.2.


2.  The Prefer Request Header

   The Prefer request-header field is used to indicate that particular
   server behaviors are preferred by the client, but not required for
   successful completion of the request.  Prefer is similar in nature to
   the Expect header field defined by [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics]
   Section 9.3 with the exception that servers are allowed to ignore
   stated preferences.

     Prefer     = "Prefer" ":" 1#preference
     preference = token [ BWS "=" BWS value ]
                  *( OWS ";" [ OWS parameter ] )
     parameter  = token [ BWS "=" BWS value ]
     value      = token / quoted-string

   This header field is defined with an extensible syntax to allow for
   future values included in the Registry of Preferences (Section 9.1)).
   A server that does not recognize or is unable to comply with
   particular preference tokens in the Prefer header field of a request
   MUST ignore those tokens and MUST NOT stop processing or signal an
   error.

   A preference token MAY specify a value.  Empty, or zero length values
   on both the preference token and within parameters are equivalent to
   no value being specified at all.  The following, then, are
   equivalent:

     Prefer: foo; bar=""
     Prefer: foo=; bar
     Prefer: foo=""; bar=



Snell                     Expires June 10, 2012                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                 HTTP Prefer                 December 2011


   An optional, arbitrary collection of parameters MAY be specified for
   any preference token.  The meaning and application of such parameters
   is dependent on the definition of each preference token and the
   server's implementation thereof.

   If a particular preference token or parameter is specified multiple
   times, repeated occurrences MUST be ignored without signaling an
   error or otherwise altering the processing of the request.

   Comparison of preference token names is case-insensitive while values
   are case-sensitive regardless of whether token or quoted-string
   values are used.

   The Prefer request header field MUST be forwarded by a proxy if the
   request is forwarded.  In various situations, A proxy may determine
   that it is capable of honoring a preference independently of the
   server to which the request is directed.  For instance, an
   intervening proxy may be capable of transparently providing
   asynchronous handling of a request using a 202 Accepted responses
   independently of the origin server.  Such proxies could choose to
   honor the "return-accepted" preference.  Individual preference tokens
   MAY define their own requirements and restrictions as to whether and
   how proxies may apply the preference to a request independently of
   the origin server.

   As per [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging], Section 3.2, Implementations
   MUST be capable of supporting either multiple instances of the Prefer
   header field in a single message as well as multiple preference
   tokens separated by commas in a single Prefer header, for instance,
   the following examples are equivalent:

     # Multiple Prefer Header Fields
     POST /foo HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Prefer: return-accepted
     Prefer: wait=100

     # Single Prefer Header Field
     POST /foo HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Prefer: return-accepted, wait=100

2.1.  Cache Considerations

   Note that while the Prefer header field is not intended to be used as
   content negotiation mechanism, the application of a preference could
   affect the caching characteristics of a response.  Specifically, if a
   server supports the optional application of a preference that could



Snell                     Expires June 10, 2012                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                 HTTP Prefer                 December 2011


   even potentially result in a variance to a cache's handling of a
   response entity, a Vary header field MUST be included with the
   response listing the Prefer header field regardless of whether the
   client actually uses Prefer in the request.

   Because of the inherent complexities involved with properly
   implementing server-driven content negotiation, effective caching,
   and the application of optional preferences, implementors must
   exercise caution when utilizing preferences in such a way as to
   impact the caching of a response.

2.2.  Examples

   The following examples illustrate the use of various Preferences
   defined by this specification, as well as undefined extensions for
   strictly illustrative purposes:

     # Return a 202 Accepted response for asynchronous processing
     # if the response cannot be processed within 10 seconds.
     # An undefined "priority" preference is also specified.

     Prefer: return-accepted, wait=10;
     Prefer: priority=5;

     # Use lenient processing

     Prefer: Lenient

     # Use of an optional, undefined parameter on the
     # return-minimal preference requesting a response
     # status code of 204 for a successful response.

     Prefer: return-minimal; status=204


3.  The "return-accepted" Preference

   The "return-accepted" preference indicates that the client prefers
   the server to respond with a 202 Accepted status in the case where
   the length of time it takes to generate a response will exceed some
   arbitrary threshold established by the server.

     return-accepted = "return-accepted"

   The key motivation for the "return-accepted" preference is to
   facilitate the operation of asynchronous request handling by allowing
   the client to indicate to a server it's capability and preference for
   handling 202 Accepted responses.

4.  The "return-representation" Preference

   The "return-representation" preference indicates that the client
   prefers that the server include an entity representing the current
   state of the resource in the response to a successful request.

     return-representation = "return-representation"

   When honoring the "return-representation" preference, the server MUST
   include a Content-Location header field specifying the URI of the
   resource representation being returned.  Per section 6.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics], the presence of the Content-Location
   header field in the response asserts that the payload is a
   representation of the resource identified by the Content-Location
   URI.

   The "return-representation" preference is intended primarily to
   provide a means of optimizing communication between the client and
   server by eliminating the need for a subsequent GET request to
   retrieve the current representation of the resource following a
   modification.

   Currently, after successfully processing a modification request such
   as a POST or PUT, a server may choose to return either an entity
   describing the status of the operation or a representation of the
   modified resource itself.  While the selection of which type of
   entity to return, if any at all, is solely at the discretion of the
   server, the "return-representation" preference -- along with the
   "return-minimal" preference defined below -- allow the server to take
   the client's preferences into consideration while constructing the
   response.


5.  The "return-minimal" Preference

   The "return-minimal" preference indicates that the client wishes the
   server to return a minimal response to a successful request.
   Typically, such responses would utilize the 204 No Content status,
   but other codes MAY be used as appropriate, such as a 200 status with
   a zero-length response entity.  The determination of what constitutes
   an appropriate minimal response is solely at the discretion of the
   server.

     return-minimal = "return-minimal"

   The "return-minimal" preference is intended to provide a means of
   optimizing communication between the client and server by reducing
   the amount of data the server is required to return to the client



Snell                     Expires June 10, 2012                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                 HTTP Prefer                 December 2011


   following a request.  This can be particularly useful, for instance,
   when communicating with limited-bandwidth mobile devices or when the
   client simply does not require any further information about the
   result of a request beyond knowing if it was successfully processed.


6.  The "wait" Preference

   The "wait" preference can be used to establish an upper bound on the
   length of time, in seconds, the client is willing to wait for a
   response, after which the client may choose to abandon the request.
   In the case generating a response will take longer than the time
   specified, the server, or proxy, can choose to either return a 202
   Accepted response, cancel processing, or continue attempting to
   complete the request.

     wait = "wait" BWS "=" BWS delta-seconds

   Clients specifying the "wait" Preference SHOULD also use the Date
   header field, as specified in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics] Section
   9.2, within the request to establish the time at which the client
   began waiting for the completion of the request.  Failing to include
   a Date header field in the request would require the server to use
   the instant it received and began processing the request as the
   baseline for determining how long the client has been waiting which
   could yield unintended results depending on how out of synch the
   client and server clocks are.


7.  The "strict" and "lenient" Processing Preferences

   The "strict" and "lenient" preferences are mutually-exclusive
   directives indicating, at the servers discretion, how the client
   wishes the server to handle potential error conditions that may arise
   in the processing of a request.  For instance, if the payload of a
   request contains various minor syntactical or semantic errors, but
   the server is still capable of comprehending and successfully
   processing the request, a decision must be made to either reject the
   request with an appropriate 4xx error response or to go ahead with
   processing.  The "strict" preference can be used by the client to
   indicate that, in such conditions, it would prefer that the server
   reject the request, while the "lenient" preference indicates that the
   client would prefer the server to attempt to process the request.
   The specific meaning and application of the "strict" and "lenient"
   directives is specific to each type of resource, the request method
   and the operation of the server.

     handling = "strict" / "lenient"

8.  Registered Preferences

   Well-defined preferences can be registered for convenience and/or to
   promote reuse by other applications.  This specification establishes
   an IANA registry of such relation types see Section Section 9.1.

   Registered preference names MUST conform to the token rule, and MUST
   be compared character-by-character in a case-insensitive fashion.
   They SHOULD be appropriate to the specificity of the preference;
   i.e., if the semantics are highly specific to a particular
   application, the name should reflect that, so that more general names
   are available for less specific use.

   Registered preferences MUST NOT constrain servers, clients or any
   intermediaries involved in the exchange and processing of a request
   to any behavior required for successful processing.  The use and
   application of a preference within a given request MUST be optional
   on the part of all participants.


9.  IANA Considerations

   The 'Prefer' header field should be added to the permanent registry
   (see [RFC3864]).


       Header field name: Prefer
       Applicable Protocol: HTTP
       Status:
       Author/Change controller: IETF
       Specification document: this specification


9.1.  The Registry of Preferences

   Preferences are registered on the advice of a Designated Expert
   (appointed by the IESG or their delegate), with a Specification
   Required (using terminology from [RFC5226]).

   The requirements for registered preferences are described in
   Section 8

   Registration requests consist of the completed registration template
   below, typically published in an RFC or Open Standard (in the sense
   described by [RFC2026], Section 7).  However, to allow for the
   allocation of values prior to publication, the Designated Expert may
   approve registration once they are satisfied that a specification
   will be published.

Internet-Draft                 HTTP Prefer                 December 2011


   Note that relation types can be registered by third parties, if the
   Designated Expert determines that an unregistered relation type is
   widely deployed and not likely to be registered in a timely manner.

   The registration template is:

   o  Preference: (A value for the Prefer request header field that
      conforms to the syntax rule given in Section 2)
   o  Description:
   o  Reference:
   o  Notes: [optional]
   o  Application Data: [optional]

   Registration requests should be sent to the preferences@ietf.org
   mailing list, marked clearly in the subject line (e.g., "NEW
   PREFERENCE - example" to register an "example" preference).

   Within at most 14 days of the request, the Designated Expert(s) will
   either approve or deny the registration request, communicating this
   decision to the review list and IANA.  Denials should include an
   explanation and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the
   request successful.

   Decisions (or lack thereof) made by the Designated Expert can be
   first appealed to Application Area Directors (contactable using
   app-ads@tools.ietf.org email address or directly by looking up their
   email addresses on http://www.iesg.org/ website) and, if the
   appellant is not satisfied with the response, to the full IESG (using
   the iesg@iesg.org mailing list).

   IANA should only accept registry updates from the Designated
   Expert(s), and should direct all requests for registration to the
   review mailing list.

9.1.1.  Initial Registry Contents

   The Preferences Registry's initial contents are:

   o  Preference: return-accepted
   o  Description: Indicates that the client prefers the server to
      respond with a 202 Accepted status as described by Section 3
   o  Reference: [this specification]

   o  Preference: return-minimal
   o  Description: Indicates that the client prefers the server return a
      minimal response to a request as described by Section 5

   o  Description: Indicates that the client wishes the server to apply
      lenient validation and error handling to the processing of a
      request.

10.  Security Considerations

   Specific preferences requested by a client can introduce security
   considerations and concerns beyond those discussed in HTTP/1.1 Parts
   1 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging], 2 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics],
   3 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p3-payload], 4 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p4-conditional],
   5 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p5-range], 6 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p6-cache], and 7
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth].  Implementors must refer to the
   specifications and descriptions of each preference to determine the
   security considerations relevant to each.
