Abstract

   Due to specific problems, NAT-PT was deprecated by the IETF as a
   mechanism to perform IPv6-IPv4 translation.  Since then, new efforts
   have been undertaken within IETF to standardize alternative
   mechanisms to perform IPv6-IPv4 translation.  This document evaluates
   how the new translation mechanisms avoid the problems that caused the
   IETF to deprecate NAT-PT.

Internet-Draft         Analysis of 64 Translation           January 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Definition

   This document uses 64 proposal (or 64 for short) to refer to the
   mechanisms defined in the following documents:

   o  Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6
      Clients to IPv4 Servers [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]

   o  DNS64: DNS extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6
      Clients to IPv4 Servers [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64]

   o  IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators [RFC6052]

   o  Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation
      [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework]

1.2.  Context

   The current 64 proposal is widely seen as a major interconnection
   technique designed to enable communications between IPv6-only and
   IPv4-only networks.  One of the building blocks of this proposal is
   decoupling the DNS functionality from the protocol translation
   itself.

   This approach is pragmatic in the sense that there is no dependency
   on DNS implementation for the successful NAT handling.  As long as
   there is a function (e.g., DNS64 [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] or other
   means) that can construct an IPv6-Embedded IPv4 address with a pre-
   configured IPv6 prefix, an IPv4 address and a suffix (refer to
   [RFC6052]), NAT64 will work just fine.

   To understand the 64 proposal, we must keep in mind that the focus of
   this proposal is on the deployment and not the implementation
   details.  As long as a NAT64 implementation conforms to the expected
   behaviour, as desired in the deployment scenario, the details are not
   very important as mentioned in this excerpt from
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]:

      "A NAT64 MAY perform the steps in a different order, or MAY
      perform different steps, but the externally visible outcome MUST
      be the same as the one described in this document."

1.3.  Scope

   This document provides an analysis of how the proposed set of
   documents that specify stateful IPv6-only to IPv4-only translation
   and replace NAT-PT [RFC2766] address the issues raised in [RFC4966].

   As a reminder, it is worth mentioning the 64 proposal analysis is
   limited in the sense that hosts from IPv6 networks can initiate a
   communication to IPv4 network/Internet, but not vice-versa.  This
   corresponds to Scenario 1 and Scenario 5 described in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework].  Hence, the scenario of servers
   moving to IPv6 while clients remaining IPv4 remains unaddressed.  Of
   course, IPv6 to IPv4 communications can also be supported if static
   bindings are configured on the stateful NAT64.

   The 64 proposal, just like any other technique under development, has
   some positives and some drawbacks.  The ups and downs of the proposal
   must be clearly understood while going forward with its future
   development.

   The scope of this document does not include stateless translation.


2.  Analysis of 64 Translation Against Concerns of RFC4966

   Of the set of problems pointed out in [RFC4966], the 64 proposal
   addresses some of them, whereas leaves others unaddressed.

   Some issues mentioned in [RFC4966] were solved by [RFC4787],
   [RFC5382] and [RFC5508].  At the time when NAT-PT was published these
   recommendations were not in place but they are orthogonal to the
   translation algorithm per se, therefore they could be implemented
   with NAT-PT.  On the other hand, NAT64 explicitly mentions that these
   recommendations need to be followed and thus should be seen as a
   complete specification.

   It is also worth pointing out that the scope of the 64 proposal is
   reduced when compared to NAT-PT.  Following is a point by point
   analysis of the problems.  Issues listed in [RFC4966] are classified
   into three categories:

   1.  Problems impossible to solve;

   2.  Problems which can be solved.

   3.  Problems solved.

Internet-Draft         Analysis of 64 Translation           January 2011


2.1.  Problems Impossible to Solve

   Problems discussed in [RFC4966], which are impossible to solve:

   1.  Inability to redirect traffic for protocols that lack de-
       multiplexing capabilities or are not built on top of specific
       transport-layer protocols for transport address translations
       (Section 2.2 of [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: This issue is not specific to 64 but to all NAT-
          based solutions.

   2.  Loss of information due to incompatible semantics between IPv4
       and IPv6 versions of headers and protocols (Section 2.4 of
       [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: This issue is not specific to 64 but due to the
          design of IPv4 and IPv6.

   3.  Need for the NAT64-capable device to act as proxy for
       correspondent node when IPv6 node is mobile, with consequent
       restrictions on mobility (Section 2.7 of [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: This is not specific to NAT64 but to all NAT
          flavors.  Refer to [I-D.haddad-mext-nat64-mobility-harmful]
          for an early analysis on mobility complications encountered
          when NAT64 is involved.

2.2.  Problems Which Can be Solved

   Problems discussed in [RFC4966], which can be solved:

   1.  Disruption of all protocols that embed IP addresses (and/or
       ports) in packet payloads or apply integrity mechanisms using IP
       addresses (and ports) (Section 2.1 of [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: In the case of FTP [RFC0959] this problem is
          addressed by the use of a FTP64 ALG [I-D.ietf-behave-ftp64]
          which is a workaround solution.  In the case of SIP [RFC3261],
          no specific issue is induced by 64; the same techniques for
          NAT traversal can be used when a NAT64 is involved in the path
          (e.g., ICE [RFC5245], Hosted NAT Traversal [RFC5853], embedded
          SIP ALGs, etc. ).  The functioning of other protocols is left
          unaddressed.  Note that the traversal of NAT64 by application
          embedding IP address literal is not specific to NAT64 but
          generic to all NAT-based solutions.

Internet-Draft         Analysis of 64 Translation           January 2011


   2.  Interaction with SCTP [RFC4960] and multihoming (Section 2.6 of
       [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: SCTP is out of scope of 64.  Only TCP and UDP
          transport protocols are within the scope of 64.

   3.  Inability to handle multicast traffic (Section 2.8 of [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: This problem is not addressed by the current 64
          specifications.

   4.  Scalability concerns together with introduction of a single point
       of failure and a security attack nexus (Section 3.2 of
       [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: This is not specific to NAT64 but to all stateful
          NAT flavors.

   5.  Creation of a DoS (Denial of Service) threat relating to
       exhaustion of memory and address/port pool resources on the
       translator (Section 3.4 of [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: This specific DoS concern on Page 6 of [RFC4966] is
          under a DNS-ALG heading in that document, and refers to NAT-
          PT's creation of NAT mapping state when a DNS query occurred.
          With the new IPv6-IPv4 translation mechanisms, DNS queries do
          not create any mapping state.  Thus, this concern is fully
          eliminated with the new IPv6-IPv4 translation mechanisms.

   6.  Restricted validity of translated DNS records: a translated
       record may be forwarded to an application that cannot use it
       (Section 4.2 of [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: If a node on the IPv4 side forwards the address of
          the other endpoint to a node which cannot reach the NAT box or
          is not covered under the endpoint-independent constraint of
          NAT, then the new node will not be able to initiate a
          successful session.

          Actually, this is not a limitation of 64 (or even NAT-PT) but
          a deployment context where shared IPv4 addresses managed by
          the NAT64 are not globally reachable.  The same limitation can
          be encountered when referrals (even without any NAT in the
          path) include reachability information with limited
          reachability scope (See [I-D.carpenter-behave-referral-object]
          for more discussion about scope-related issues).

   7.  Unless UDP encapsulation is used for IPsec [RFC3948], traffic
       using IPsec AH (Authentication Header), in transport and tunnel
       mode, and IPsec ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload), in
       transport mode, is unable to be carried through NAT-PT without
       terminating the security associations on the NAT-PT, due to their
       usage of cryptographic integrity protection (Section 4.5 of
       [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: This is not specific to NAT64 but to all NAT
          flavours.

   8.  Address selection issues when either the internal or external
       hosts implement both IPv4 and IPv6 (Section 4.1 of [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: This is out of scope of 64 since Scenarios 1 and 5
          of [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework] assume IPv6-only hosts.

          Therefore this issue is not resolved and mitigation techniques
          outside the 64 need to be used.  These techniques may allow to
          offload NAT64 resources and prefer native communications which
          do not involve address family translation.  Avoiding NAT
          devices in the path is encouraged for mobile nodes in order to
          save power consumption due to keepalive messages which are
          required to maintain NAT states ("always-on" services).  An
          in-depth discussion can be found in
          [I-D.wing-behave-dns64-config].

2.3.  Problems Solved

   Problems, identified in [RFC4966], which are solved:

   1.  Constraints on network topology (as it relates to DNS-ALG; see
       Section 3.1 of [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: This issue has mitigated severity as the DNS is
          separated from the NAT functionality.  Nevertheless, a minimal
          coordination may be required to ensure that the NAT64 to be
          crossed (the one to which the IPv4-Converted IPv6 address
          returned to a requesting host) must be in the path and has
          also sufficient resources to handle received traffic.

   2.  Need for additional state and/or packet reconstruction in dealing
       with packet fragmentation.  Otherwise, implement no support for
       fragments.  (Section 2.5 of [RFC4966])

          Analysis: This issue is not specific to 64 but to all NAT-
          based solutions.  [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]
          specifies how to handle fragmentation; appropriate



Penno, et al.             Expires July 27, 2011                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         Analysis of 64 Translation           January 2011


          recommendations to avoid fragmentation-related DoS attacks are
          proposed (e.g., limit resources to be dedicated to out of
          order fragments).

   3.  Inappropriate translation of responses to A queries from IPv6
       nodes (Section 4.3 of [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: DNS64 [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] does not resolve A
          queries.

   4.  Address selection issues and resource consumption in a DNS-ALG
       with multi-addressed nodes (Section 4.4 of [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: Since the DNS-ALG is not there, there is no need to
          maintain temporary states in anticipation of connections.
          Note that static binding are required to allow for
          communications initiated from an IPv4 client to an IPv6
          server.

   5.  Limitations on DNS security capabilities when using a DNS-ALG
       (Section 2.5 of [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: A DNSSEC validating stub resolver behind a DNS64 in
          server mode is not supported.  Therefore if a host wants to do
          its own DNSSEC validation, and it wants to use a NAT64, the
          host has to also perform its own DNS64 synthesis.  Refer to
          Section 3 of[I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] for more details.

   6.  Creation of a DoS (Denial of Service) threat relating to
       exhaustion of memory and address/port pool resources on the
       translator (Section 3.4 of [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: This specific DoS concern on Page 6 of [RFC4966] is
          under a DNS-ALG heading in that document, and refers to NAT-
          PT's creation of NAT mapping state when a DNS query occurred.
          With the new IPv6-IPv4 translation mechanisms, DNS queries do
          not create any mapping state in the NAT64.  Thus, this concern
          is fully eliminated in 64.

   7.  Requirement for applications to use keepalive mechanisms to
       workaround connectivity issues caused by premature timeout for
       session table and BIB entries (Section 2.3 of [RFC4966]).

          Analysis: Since NAT64 follows some of the [RFC4787], [RFC5382]
          and [RFC5508] requirements, there is a high lower bound for
          the lifetime of sessions.  In NAT-PT this was unknown and
          applications needed to assume the worst case.  For instance,
          in NAT64, the lifetime for a TCP session is approximately 2



Penno, et al.             Expires July 27, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         Analysis of 64 Translation           January 2011


          hours, so not much keep-alive signalling overhead is needed.

          Application clients (e.g., VPN clients) are not aware of the
          timer configured in the NAT device.  For unmanaged services, a
          conservative approach would be adopted by applications which
          issue frequent keepalive messages to be sure that an active
          mapping is still be maintained by any involved NAT64 device
          even if the NAT64 complies with TCP/UDP/ICMP BEHAVE WG
          specifications.

          Note that keepalive messages may be issued by applications to
          ensure that an active entry is maintained by a firewall, with
          or without a NAT in the path, which is located in the
          boundaries of a local domain.

   8.  Lack of address mapping persistence: Some applications require
       address retention between sessions.  The user traffic will be
       disrupted if a different mapping is used.  The use of the DNS-ALG
       to create address mappings with limited lifetimes means that
       applications must start using the address shortly after the
       mapping is created, as well as keep it alive once they start
       using it.  (Section 3.3 of [RFC4966])

          Analysis: In the context of 64, the external IPv4 address
          (representing the IPv6 host in the IPv4 network) is assigned
          by the NAT64 machinery and not the DNS64 function.  Address
          persistence can be therefore easily ensured by the NAT64
          function (which complies with BEHAVE NAT recommendations).
          Address persistence should be guaranteed for both dynamic and
          static bindings.

          In the IPv6 side of the NAT64, the same IPv6 address is used
          to represent an IPv4 host; no issue about address persistence
          is raised in IPv6 network.


3.  Conclusions

   The above analysis of the solutions provided by the 64 proposal shows
   that the majority of the problems that are not directly related to
   the decoupling of NAT and DNS remain unaddressed.  Some of these
   problems are not specific to 64 but are generic to all NAT-based
   solutions.

   This points to several shortcomings of 64 proposal which must be
   addressed if the future network deployments have to move reliably
   towards 64 as a solution to IPv6-IPv4 interconnection.

Internet-Draft         Analysis of 64 Translation           January 2011


   Some of the issues, as pointed out in [RFC4966], have possible
   solutions.  However these solutions will require significant updates
   to the 64 proposal, increasing its complexity.

   The following table summarizes the conclusions based on the analysis
   of 64 proposal.
