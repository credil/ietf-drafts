        Emergency Alert Service support in IEEE 802.11 networks 
                     draft-bajko-atoca-wlan-eas-00 
 
 
Abstract 
    
   This document attempts to explain what level of support for 
   Authority to Citizen type of Emergency Alerts the IEEE 802.11 
   specification defined protocol has.  
   The IEEE 802.11 specification is evolving by defining new amendments 
   to it, which are then rolled into the base spec. The 802.11u 
   amendment, published in November 2010, contains support for Citizen 
   to Authority type of Emergency Calls and Authority to Citizen type 
   of Alerts.  
   The -00 version of the draft is just the skeleton, to meet the 
   deadline for -00 draft submissions, version -01 will have the 
   details.
