                   Duplicate Address Detection Proxy
                     draft-costa-6man-dad-proxy-00

Abstract

   The document describes a mechanism allowing the use of Duplicate
   Address Detection (DAD) by IPv6 nodes in a VLAN N:1 with "split-
   horizon" model DSL architecture.  Based on the DAD signalling, the
   first hop router stores all used addresses on the VLAN in a Binding
   Table.  When a node performs DAD for an address already used by
   another node, the first hop router replies instead of this last one.

Internet-Draft                  DAD-Proxy                      July 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document explains why Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)
   mechanism [RFC4862] cannot be used in a VLAN N:1 with "split-horizon"
   model DSL architecture.  One of the main reasons is IPv6 nodes on the
   same VLAN cannot have direct communication: all the messages between
   them must go through the first hop router.

   This document specifies a mechanism allowing the use of DAD by the
   hosts on the same VLAN.  It only impacts the first hop router and it
   doesn't need modifications on the other IPv6 nodes.

   It is assumed in this document that Link-layer addresses on a VLAN
   are unique from the first hop router's point of view (e.g. in an
   untrusted Ethernet architecture this assumption can be guaranteed
   thanks to the use of "MAC Address Translation" mechanism performed
   upstream by a device between IPv6 nodes and the first hop router).

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Background

   Terminology in this document follows that in Neighbor Discovery for
   IP version 6 (IPv6) document [RFC4861] and IPv6 Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration document [RFC4862].  In addition, this section
   defines additional terms related to the DSL architecture:

   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)
         The first IPv6 node in a customer's network.

   Access Node (AN)
         The first aggregation point in the DSL access network.  It is
         considered as a L2 bridge in this document.

   Broadband Network Gateway (BNG)
         The first hop router from the CPE's point of view.

   VLAN N:1 architecture
         A many-to-one forwarding scheme where many CPEs are connected
         to the same VLAN.  The CPEs may be connected on the same or
         different Access Nodes.

   split-horizon model
         A model where CPEs cannot have direct layer 2 nor layer 3
         communications between them (i.e.  IP flows must be forwarded
         through the BNG via routing).

   The following figure shows where are the different entities defined
   above.

                        Figure 1: DSL Architecture


3.  Why IETF solutions don't work?

   In a DSL architecture depicted in Figure 1, CPE1,2,3 and BNG are IPv6
   nodes, while AN is a special bridge providing links between CPEs and
   the BNG.  AN enforces in a split-horizon mode so that all CPEs can
   only talk to BNG but not to each other.  That said, each CPE is on a
   same link with BNG, but one CPE is not on a same link with any other
   CPE.

3.1.  Duplicate Address Detection

   Duplicate Address Dectection (DAD) [RFC4862] is performed when an
   IPv6 node verifies the uniqueness of a tentative address.  This node
   sends a Neighbour Solicitation (NS) message with the IP destination
   set to solicited-node multicast address of the tentative address.
   This NS message is multicasted to other nodes on a same link.  When
   the tentative address is already used on the link by another node,
   this last one replies with a Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message to
   inform the first node.  So when performing DAD, a node expects the NS
   messages are received by other nodes.

   However, in a DSL network depicted in Figure 1, split-horizon is
   implemented on AN to prevent CPEs from talking to each other



Costa, et al.            Expires January 3, 2011                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  DAD-Proxy                      July 2010


   directly.  All packets sent out from a CPE would be forward by AN
   only to BNG but none of other CPE nodes.  That said, NS messages sent
   by a certain CPE will be received only by BNG, which will never
   forward these NS messages to other CPEs.  So, other CPEs have no idea
   that a certain address is used by another CPE.  That means, in a
   network with split-horizon, DAD per RFC4862 can't work properly.

3.2.  Neighbor Discovery Proxy

   Neighbor Discovery (ND) Proxy [RFC4389] is designed for forwarding ND
   messages between different IP links where the subnet prefix is the
   same.  A ND Proxy function on a bridge forwards received ND messages
   to other segments with correct-link layer type address.  When the ND
   proxy receives a multicast ND message, it forwards it to all other
   interfaces on a same link.

   In the DSL network depicted in Figure 1, when AN, acting as a ND
   Proxy, receives a ND message from a CPE, it will forward it to BNG
   but none of other CPEs, as only BNG is on the same link with the CPE.
   Hence, implementing ND Proxy on AN doesn't help a CPE acknowledge
   link-local addresses used by other CPEs.

   As the BNG MUST NOT forward link-local scoped messages sent from a
   CPE to other CPEs, ND Proxy cannot be implemented in the BNG.

3.3.  6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery

   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd] defines an optional modification of DAD for a
   6LowPAN.  When a 6LoWPAN node wants to configure an IPv6 address, it
   registers this one to one or more of its default router using the
   Address Registration option (ARO).  If this address is already owned
   by another node, the router informs the 6LoWPAN node this address
   cannot be configured.

   A problem for this mechanism is that it requires modifications in
   hosts in order to support the Address Registration option.

3.4.  IPv6 Mobility Manager

   According to [RFC3775], a home agent acts as a proxy for mobile nodes
   when these last ones are away from the home network: the home agent
   defends an mobile node's home address by replying to NS messages with
   NA messages.

   There is a problem for this mechanism if it is applied in the DSL
   network depicted in Figure 1.  Operators of DSL networks require a NA
   message is only received by the sender of the corresponding NS
   message for security reason.  However, the home agent per [RFC3775]

Internet-Draft                  DAD-Proxy                      July 2010


   multicasts NA messages on the home link and all nodes on this link
   will receive these NA messages.  This shortcoming prevents this
   mechanism being deployed in a DSL network directly.


4.  Duplicate Address Detection Proxy (DAD-Proxy) specifications

4.1.  DAD-Proxy Data structure

   A BNG needs to store, in a Binding Table, information related to the
   IPv6 addresses generated by any CPE on a VLAN.  Each entry in this
   Binding Table MUST contain the following fields:

   o  IPv6 Address

   o  Link-layer Address

   o  Creation Time

4.2.  DAD-Proxy mechanism

   When a CPE performs DAD, as specified in [RFC4862], it sends a
   Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message, with the unspecified address as
   source address, in order to check if a tentative address is already
   in use on the link.  The BNG receives this message and MUST perform
   actions depending on the information in the Binding Table.

4.2.1.  No entry exists for the tentative address

   When there is no entry for the tentative address, the BNG MUST create
   one with following information:

   o  IPv6 Address Field set to the tentative address in the NS message.

   o  Link-layer Address Field set to the Link-layer source address in
      the Link-layer Header of the NS message.

   o  Creation Time set to the value of the BNG clock when the entry is
      created.

4.2.2.  An entry already exists for the tentative address

   When there is an entry for the tentative address, the BNG MUST check
   the following conditions:

   o  The address in the Target Address Field in the NS message is equal
      to the address in the IPv6 Address Field in the entry.

Internet-Draft                  DAD-Proxy                      July 2010


   o  The source address of the IPv6 Header in the NS message is equal
      to the unspecified address.

   When these conditions are met and the source address of the Link-
   Layer Header in the NS message is equal to the address in the Link-
   Layer Address Field in the entry, that means the CPE is still
   performing DAD for this address.  The BNG MUST NOT reply to the CPE.

   When these conditions are met and the source address of the Link-
   Layer Header in the NS message is not equal to the address in the
   Link-Layer Address Field in the entry, that means another CPE
   performs DAD for an already owned address.  As shown in Figure 2, the
   BNG MUST reply to the CPE that has sent the NS message with a NA
   message which has the following format:

   Layer 2 Header Fields:

         Source Address
               The Link-layer address of the interface on which the BNG
               received the NS message.

         Destination Address
               The source address in the Layer 2 Header of the NS
               message received by the BNG.

   IPv6 Header Fields:

         Source Address
               An address assigned to the interface from which the
               advertisement is sent.

         Destination Address
               The all-nodes multicast address.

   ICMPv6 Fields:

         Target Address
               The tentative address already used.

         Target Link-layer address
               The Link-layer address of the interface on which the BNG
               received the NS message.

                                 Figure 2

   The BNG and the CPE MUST support the Unicast Transmission of IPv6
   Multicast Messages on Link-layer [I-D.gundavelli-v6ops-l2-unicast],
   to be able, respectively, to generate and to process such a packet
   format.


5.  IANA Considerations

   No new options or messages are defined in this document.


6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Interoperability with SEND

   If SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971] is used, the mechanism
   specified in this document may break the security.  Indeed, if an
   entry already exists and the BNG has to send a reply (cf.
   Section 4.2.2), the BNG doesn't own the private key(s) associated
   with to the Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] to
   correctly sign the proxied ND messages [I-D.ietf-csi-sndp-prob].

   To keep the same level of security, Secure Proxy ND Support for SEND
   [I-D.ietf-csi-proxy-send] SHOULD be used and implemented on the BNG
   and the CPEs.

6.2.  IP source address spoofing protection

   To ensure a protection against IP source address spoofing in data
   packets, this proposal may be used in combinaison with Source Address
   Validation Improvement (SAVI) mechanisms [I-D.ietf-savi-fcfs]
   [I-D.ietf-savi-send].
