Abstract

   Add-Paths is a BGP enhancement that allows a BGP router to advertise
   multiple distinct paths for the same prefix/NLRI. This provides a
   number of potential benefits, including reduced routing churn, faster
   convergence and better loadsharing.

   This document provides recommendations to implementers of Add-Paths
   so that network operators have the tools needed to address their
   specific applications and to manage the scalability impact of Add-
   Paths. A router implementing Add-Paths may learn many paths for a
   prefix and must decide which of these to advertise to peers. This
   document analyses different algorithms for making this selection and
   provides recommendations based on the target application.

1. Introduction

   The BGP Add-Paths capability enhances current BGP implementations by
   allowing a BGP router to exchange with its BGP peers more than one
   path for the same destination/NLRI. The base BGP standard [RFC 4271]
   does not provide for such a capability. If a BGP router learns
   multiple paths for the same NLRI (from multiple peers), it selects
   only one as its best path and advertises the best path to its peers.
   The primary goal of Add-Paths is to increase the visibility of paths
   within an iBGP system.  This has the effect of improving robustness
   in case of failure, reducing the number of BGP messages exchanged
   during such an event, and offering the potential for faster re-
   convergence. Through careful selection of the paths to be advertised,
   Add-Paths can also prevent routing oscillations.

   The purpose of this document is to provide the necessary
   recommendations to the implementers of Add-Paths so that network
   operators have the tools needed to address their specific
   applications and to manage the scalability impact of Add-Paths while
   maintaining routing consistency.  A router implementing Add-Paths may
   learn many paths for a prefix and must decide which of these to
   advertise to peers. This document analyses different algorithms for
   making this selection and provides recommendations based on the
   target application.

2. Terminology

   In this document the following terms are used:

   Add-Paths peer: refers a peer with which the local system has agreed
   to receive and/or send NLRI with path identifiers

   Primary path: A path toward a prefix that is considered a best path
   by the BGP decision process [RFC 4271] and actively used for
   forwarding traffic to that prefix. A router may have multiple primary
   paths for a prefix if it implements multipath.

   Backup path: One of the non-best paths toward a prefix.

   Optimal backup path: the backup path that will be selected as the new
   best path for a prefix when all primary paths are removed/withdrawn.

   AS-Wide preferred paths: All paths that are considered as best when
   applying rules of the BGP decision process up to the IGP tie-break.

   Path diversity: The property that a router has several paths for a
   given prefix and each one is associated with a unique BGP next-hop
   (and BGP router).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

3. Add-Paths Applications

   [draft-mohapatra] presents the applications that would benefit from
   multiple paths advertisement in iBGP.  They are summarized in the
   following subsections.

3.1. Fast Connectivity Restoration

   With the dissemination of backup paths, fast connectivity restoration
   and convergence can be achieved.  If a router has a backup path, it
   can directly select that path as best upon failure of the primary
   path.  This minimizes packet loss on dataplane.  Sending multiple
   paths in iBGP allows routers to receive backup paths when path
   visibility is not sufficient with classical BGP.  This is especially
   useful when Route Reflection is used.

   Consider a network such as the one depicted in Figure 1 and suppose
   that none of the routers support Add-Paths. From AS1 there are 3
   paths (A, B and C) to a particular destination XYZ: two of the paths
   are via AS3 and one of the paths is via AS2. In this example, Path A
   is preferred over Path B due to Path A having a lower MED (multi-exit
   discriminator) (MED for Path A is lower than MED for path B).

   AS1 uses a route reflector RR1 to reduce the scale of its IBGP mesh.
   During steady state, RR1 knows about (has in its RIB-IN) only 2 of
   the 3 paths. Router B suppresses the advertisement of its best
   external path (B) to RR, an IBGP peer, because its best overall path
   is A, learnt from router A (via the RR). RR1 chooses path A as the
   overall best since its IGP cost to router A is the lowest among path
   A and C. During normal conditions, router D has even less knowledge
   of the available paths to destination XYZ; it knows only about path
   (A), the best path from RR1's perspective.

                        Figure 1: Example Topology


   Consider now the steps required to restore traffic from router D to
   destination XYZ when the link between Router A and Router E fails.

   1. Router A sends a BGP UPDATE message withdrawing its advertisement
      of path (A).

   2. RR receives the withdrawal, and propagates it to its other client
      peers, routers B, C and D.

   3. When router B receives the withdrawal of path (A) it reruns its
      decision process and selects path (B) as its new best path. Router
      B advertises path (B) to RR.

   4. RR reruns its decision process and selects path (B) as its new
      best path. RR advertises path (B) to client peers A, C and D.

   5. Router D reruns its decisions process, determines path (B) to be
      the best path, and updates its forwarding table. After this step
      traffic from router D to destination XYZ is restored (the traffic
      path has changed from A to B).

   With the use of Add-Paths, the convergence time for the above path
   failure example can be reduced considerably. The main reason for the
   improvement is that Add-Paths allows router D to be aware of more
   than one path to destination XYZ prior to the failure of the best
   path (A). In steady-state (with no failures) router B decides, as
   before, that path (A) is its best path but it also advertises path
   (B) - which happens to be its next-best overall path and its best
   "external" path - to RR. With Add-Paths RR1 now has knowledge of all
   3 paths to destination XYZ and it can advertise more than just the
   best path (A) to its peers. Suppose RR1 is allowed to advertise up to
   3 paths for destination XYZ. In this case, with the appropriate path
   selection algorithm, it will advertise paths (A), (B) and (C) to
   router D. Now consider again the scenario where the link between
   Router A and Router E fails. In this case, with Add-Paths, fewer
   steps are required to achieve re-convergence:

   1. Router A sends a BGP UPDATE message withdrawing its advertisement
      of path (A).

   2. RR1 receives the withdrawal, and propagates it to its other client
      peers, routers B, C and D.

   3. Router D receives the withdrawal, reruns the decision process and
      updates the forwarding entry for destination XYZ.

3.2. Load Balancing

   Increased path diversity allows routers to install several paths in
   their forwarding tables in order to load balance traffic across those
   paths.

3.3. Churn Reduction

   When Add-Paths is used in an AS, the availability of additional
   backup paths means failures can be recovered locally with much less
   path exploration in iBGP and therefore less Updates disseminated in
   eBGP.  When the preferred backup path is the post-convergence path,
   churn is minimized.

3.4. Suppression of MED-Related Persistent Route Oscillation

   As described in [oscillation], Add-Paths is a valuable tool in
   helping to stop persistent route oscillations caused by comparison of
   paths based on MED in topologies where route reflectors or the
   confederation structure hide some paths. With the appropriate path
   selection algorithm Add-Paths stops these route oscillations because
   the same set of paths are consistently advertised by the route

   reflector or the confederation border router and the routers
   receiving this set of paths make stable routing decisions about the
   best path.

4. Implementation Guidelines

   In this section, we discuss recommendations for the implementation of
   add-paths. We first discuss the BGP capability negotiations related
   to the use of Add-paths among iBGP peers, as well as their
   configuration aspects. Next, we provide an overview of RIB-IN
   management issues for the support of Add-paths. Finally, we discuss
   the properties of various algorithms for the selection of the paths
   to be advertised by a BGP speaker supporting Add-paths. The goal of
   this last section is to recommend, in future revisions of the draft,
   a default paths selection mode, as well as the minimal set of modes
   to be supported by a BGP speaker supporting Add-paths.

4.1. Capability Negotiation

       +---+           +---+

                       Figure 2: BGP Peering Example


   In Figure 2, in order for a router A to receive multiple paths per
   NLRI from peer B, for a particular address family (AFI=x, SAFI=y),
   the BGP capabilities advertisements during session setup must
   indicate that peer B wants to send multiple paths for AFI=x, SAFI=y
   and that router A is willing to receive multiple paths for AFI=x,
   SAFI=y. Similarly, in order for router A to send multiple paths per
   NLRI to peer B, for a particular address family (AFI=x, SAFI=y), the
   BGP capabilities advertisements must indicate that router A wants to
   send multiple paths for AFI=x, SAFI=y and peer B is willing to
   receive multiple paths for AFI=x, SAFI=y. Refer to [Add-Paths] for
   details of the Add-Paths capabilities advertisement.

   The capabilities of the local router shall be configurable per peer
   and per address family, with the ability to configure send-only
   operation or receive-only operation. The default mode of operation
   shall be to both send and receive.

Internet-Draft  draft-uttaro-idr-add-paths-guidelines         July 2010



4.2. Receiving Multiple Paths

   Currently, per standard BGP behavior, if a BGP router receives an
   advertisement of an NLRI and path from a specific peer and that peer
   subsequently advertises the same NLRI with different path information
   (e.g. a different NEXT_HOP and/or different path attributes) the new
   path effectively overwrites the existing path.

   When Add-Paths has been negotiated with the peer, the newly
   advertised path should be stored in the RIB-IN along with all of the
   paths previously advertised (and not withdrawn) by the peer.

   When the Add-Paths receive capability for (AFIx, SAFIy) has been
   negotiated with a peer all advertisements and withdrawals of NLRI
   within that address family by that peer shall include a path
   identifier, as described in [Add-Paths]. The path identifiers have no
   significance to the receiving peer. If the combination of NLRI and
   path identifier in an advertisement from a peer is unique (does not
   match an existing route in the RIB-IN from that peer) then the route
   is added to the RIB-IN. If the combination of NLRI and path
   identifier in a received advertisement is the same as an existing
   route in the RIB-IN from the peer then the new route replaces the
   existing one. If the combination of NLRI and path identifier in a
   received withdrawal matches an existing route in the RIB-IN from the
   peer then that route shall be removed from the RIB-IN.

   A BGP UPDATE message from a peer sending NLRI with the path
   identifier may advertise and withdraw more than one NLRI belonging to
   one or more address families. In this case Add-Paths may be supported
   for some of the address families and not others. In this situation
   the receiving BGP router should not expect that all of the path
   identifiers in the UPDATE message will be the same.

4.3. Advertising Multiple Paths

   [Add-Paths] specifies how to encode the advertisement of multiple
   paths towards the same NLRI over an iBGP session, but provides no
   details about which set of multiple paths should be advertised.  In
   this section we present different path selection algorithms and
   provide implementation recommendations based on the following
   considerations:

   Control Plane Load: When a router receives multiples paths for a
   prefix from an iBGP client it has to store more paths in its Adj-Rib-
   Ins.



Uttaro, et al.         Expires January 26, 2011                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft  draft-uttaro-idr-add-paths-guidelines         July 2010


   Control Plane Stress: Coping with multiple iBGP paths has two
   implications on the computation that a router has to handle. First,
   it has to compute the paths to send to its peers, i.e. more than the
   best path.  Second, it also has to handle the potential churn related
   to the exchange of those multiple paths.

   MED/IGP oscillations: BGP sometimes suffers from routing oscillations
   when the physical topology differs from the logical topology, or when
   the MED attribute is used.  This is due to the limited path
   visibility when a single path is advertised and Route Reflection is
   used.  Increasing the path visibility by advertising multiple paths
   can help solve this issue.

   Path optimality: When a single path is advertised, border routers do
   not always receive the optimal path. As an example, Route Reflectors
   send a single path chosen based on their own IGP tie-break.
   Increasing path visibility would also help routers to learn the path
   that is best suited for them w.r.t. the IGP tie-break.

   Backup path optimality: Multiple paths advertisement gives routers
   the opportunity to have a backup path.  However, some backup paths
   are better than others.  Indeed, when a link failure occurs, if a
   router already knows its post-convergence path, the BGP re-
   convergence is straightforward and traffic is less impacted by the
   transient use of non-best forwarding paths.

   Convergence time: Advertising multiple paths in iBGP has an impact on
   the convergence time of the BGP system.  More paths need to be
   exchanged, but on the other hand, the routing information is
   propagated faster. With an increased path visibility, there is less
   path exploration during the convergence.  Also, with the availability
   of backup paths, convergence time in case of failure is also reduced.

   Target application: Depending on the application type, the number of
   paths to advertise for a prefix will vary. For example, for fast
   connectivity restoration, it may be sufficient to advertise only 2
   paths to a peer so that it will have the best path and the optimal
   backup path. For load balancing purposes, it may be desirable to
   advertise more paths, but inclusion of the optimal backup path in the
   set may be less critical. For route oscillation elimination, it is
   required to advertise all group-best paths for a prefix.

4.3.1. Path Selection Modes

   The path selection mode and any parameters applicable to the mode
   MUST be configurable per AFI/SAFI and per peer and SHOULD be
   configurable per prefix.

Internet-Draft  draft-uttaro-idr-add-paths-guidelines         July 2010


4.3.1.1. Advertise All Paths

   A simple rule for advertising multiple paths in iBGP is to simply
   advertise to iBGP peers all received paths, provided they pass export
   filters.  This solution is easy to implement, but the counter part is
   that all those paths need to be stored by all routers that receive
   them, which can be quite expensive.  If a path to a prefix P is
   advertised to N border routers, with a Full Mesh of iBGP sessions,
   all routers have N paths in their Adj-RIB-Ins.  If Route Reflection
   is used and each client is connected to 2 Route Reflectors, it may
   learn up to 2*N paths.

   This solution gives a perfect path visibility to all routers, thus
   limiting churn and losses of connectivity in case of failure. Indeed,
   this allows routers to select their optimal primary path, and to
   switch on their optimal backup path in case of failure.

   However, as more paths are exchanged, the number of BGP messages
   disseminated during the initial iBGP convergence can be high, and
   convergence may be slower.

   Routing oscillations are prevented with this rule, because a router
   won't need to withdraw a previously advertised path when its best
   path changes.

4.3.1.2. Advertise N Paths

   Another solution is for a router to advertise a maximum of N paths to
   iBGP peers.  Here, the computational cost is the selection of the N
   paths. Indeed, there must be a ranking of the paths in order to
   advertise the most interesting ones.  A way for a router to select N
   paths is to run N times its decision process. At each iteration of
   the process only those paths not selected during a previous iteration
   and not having a NEXT_HOP or BGP Identifier (or Originator ID) in
   common with the previously-selected paths are eligible for
   consideration. The memory cost is bounded: a router receives a
   maximum of N paths for each prefix from each peer. With N equal to 2,
   all routers know at least two paths and can provide local recovery in
   case of failure.  If multipath routing is to be deployed in the AS, N
   can be increased to provide more alternate paths to the routers.

   Path optimality and backup path optimality are not guaranteed, but as
   path diversity is better, the nexthops of the chosen primary and
   backup path are more likely to be closer to the router than with
   classical BGP.

   This solution helps to reduce routing oscillations, but not in all
   cases.  Indeed, path visibility is still constrained by the maximum
   number of paths, and configurations with routing oscillations still
   exist.

4.3.1.3. Advertise All AS-Wide Best Paths

   Another choice is to advertise all paths with the same AS-wide
   preference [Basu-ibgp-osc], i.e. the paths that all routers would
   select based on the rules of the decision process that are not
   router-dependent (i.e.  Local-preference, ASPath length and MED
   rules).  Thus, for a given router, those paths only differ by the IGP
   cost to the nexthop or by the tie-breaking rules.

   The computational cost is reduced, as a router only has to send the
   paths remaining before applying the IGP tie-breaking rule.  However,
   it is difficult to predict how many paths will be stored, as it
   depends on the number of eBGP sessions on which this prefix is
   advertised with the best AS-wide preference.

   With this rule, the routing system is optimal: all routers can choose
   their best path (or best paths if multipath is used) based on their
   router-specific preferences, i.e. the IGP cost to the nexthop. Hot
   potato routing is respected.  Also, MED oscillations are prevented,
   because the path visibility among the AS-wide preferred paths is
   total.

   The existence of a backup path is not guaranteed. If only one path
   with the AS-wide best attributes exists, there is no backup path
   disseminated.  However, if such a path exists, it is optimal as it
   has the same AS-wide preference as the primary.

4.3.1.4. Advertise ALL AS-Wide Best Paths Plus Best-Next

   In order to cope with the potential lack of backup path availability
   with Advertise All AS-Wide Best Paths, "All AS-Wide Best Paths Plus
   Next-Best" lets a BGP Speaker advertise the best path that is not in
   the set of AS-Wide best paths, in addition to the AS-Wide best paths.

   Under such a mode, a BGP speaker knows multiple AS-Wide best paths or
   the AS-Wide best path and the "best" of the non AS-Wide best path, so
   that backup path availability is ensured.  Note that the post-
   convergence paths will be known by each BGP node in an AS supporting
   this mode.

   The computation complexity of this mode is relatively low as it
   requires to run the usual BGP Decision Process up to and including

   the MED rule.  The set of paths remaining after that step form the
   AS-Wide best paths.  Next, a single best path selection algorithm is
   run based on the paths that are not in the set of AS-Wide best paths.

   The number of paths for a prefix p, known by a given router of the
   AS, is the number of AS-Wide best paths found at the Borders of the
   AS, plus one if there exists a path that is not in the set of AS-Wide
   best paths.

   Although MED oscillations on the primary paths are avoided by this
   mode, oscillations can occur for the selection of the "next best"
   paths.  A variant of this mode that would advertise all AS-Wide
   second best paths instead of only the next path would allow the
   avoidance of MED oscillations on both primary and backup paths.

4.3.1.5. Advertise Neighbor-AS Group Best Path

   [walton-osc] proposes that a router groups its paths based on the
   neighbor AS from which it was learned, and to advertise the best path
   in each of those groups.

   The control plane stress induced by this solution is the computation
   of the per-neighbor path group, and the application of the decision
   process to each of them.  The Control-Plane load is bounded by the
   number of neighboring ASes advertising a prefix, which cannot be
   known a-priori.

   Path optimality and backup path optimality are not guaranteed, as the
   paths advertised are not all the AS-wide preferred paths. Backup path
   availability is not guaranteed.  Indeed, if only one AS advertises
   this prefix, even on multiple eBGP sessions, only one of the paths
   may be selected and advertised.

4.3.1.6. Best LocPref/Second LocPref

   This selection method consists in grouping the paths by Local
   Preference.  A router sends to its peers all paths with the highest
   Local Preference.  If there is only a single path with the highest
   Local Preference, it also sends all paths with the second best Local
   Preference.

   This method ensures that all routers know all paths with the best
   local preference.  As local preference are often related to the type
   of peering of the peer the path comes from, this ensures that in case
   of failure, routers have a backup path of equivalent quality.  This
   prevents for example that a router switches temporarily on a peer
   path while an alternate path from a customer is available but hidden

   at the border of the AS.  Such a situation could result in a
   temporary withdrawal of the prefix on some eBGP sessions when the
   router selects the path via the peer.

   The advertisement of the Second Local Preference occurs when there is
   no alternate path with the same quality as the best path.  This way,
   fast convergence is still ensured.  Backup path is optimal, as it has
   the second AS-Wide preference, which becomes the AS-wide best
   preference upon failure of the primary one.

   Sending all the paths with a given Local Preference also has a
   positive impact on routing optimality. Indeed, this allows border
   routers to have an increased path visibility and to choose their best
   path based on their own criteria.

   The computational cost of this solution is reduced when there are
   several paths with the best local preference.  In this case, it is
   sufficient to stop the decision process after the first rule to have
   the set of paths to be advertised.  When it is necessary to advertise
   the paths with second local-preference, the additional cost is to
   apply a second time the first rule of the decision process, which is
   still reasonable.  The memory cost depends on the number of paths
   with the best local preference.

4.3.1.7. Advertise Paths at decisive step -1

   When the goal is to provide fast recovery by advertising candidate
   post-reconvergence paths, one can choose to stop the decision process
   just before the step where only one path remains.  If the decision
   process comes to IGP tie-break, all remaining paths are advertised.
   This way, routers advertise as many paths as possible with a quality
   as similar as possible.

   This path selection is an intermediary solution between the two
   preceding ones.  Here, instead of stopping the decision process at
   the local preference step or the IGP step, we stop it before the rule
   that removes the best potential backup paths.  This way, we minimize
   the number of paths to advertise while guaranteeing the presence of a
   backup path.  Primary and backup path optimality is ensured, as all
   paths with the same AS-wide preference as the best paths are included
   in the set of paths advertised.

5. Scalability and Routing Consistency Considerations

   When Add-Paths is introduced into a network it can have important
   implications on nodal and network scalability and routing consistency
   and correctness.


Uttaro, et al.         Expires January 26, 2011               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft  draft-uttaro-idr-add-paths-guidelines         July 2010


   In terms of scalability, we note that advertising multiple paths per
   prefix requires more memory and state than the current behavior of
   advertising the best path only. A BGP speaker that does not implement
   Add-Paths maintains send state information in its prefix data
   structure per neighbor as a way to determine that the prefix has been
   advertised to the neighbor. With Add-Paths, this information has to
   be replicated on a per path basis that needs to be advertised.
   Mathematically, if "send state" size per prefix is 's' bytes, number
   of neighbors is 'n', and number of paths being advertised is 'p',
   then the current memory requirement for BGP "send state" = n * s
   bytes; with Add-Paths, it becomes n * s * p bytes. In practice, this
   value may be reduced with implementation optimizations similar to
   attribute sharing.  Receiving multiple paths per prefix also requires
   more memory and state since each path is a separate entry in the Adj-
   RIB-Ins.

   As discussed in previous sections Add-Paths can help routers select
   more optimal paths and it can help deal with certain route
   oscillation conditions arising from incomplete knowledge of the
   available paths.  But depending on the path selection algorithm and
   how it is used Add-Paths is not immune to its own cases of routing
   inconsistencies. If the BGP routers within an AS do not make
   consistent routing decisions about how to reach a particular
   destination, route oscillations may occur and these route
   oscillations may result in traffic loss.

   Optimizing an Add-Paths deployment for scalability may run counter to
   routing consistency goals, and in these circumstances operators have
   to decide the correct tradeoff for their particular deployment. For
   example the Advertise All Paths mode, if applied to many prefixes, is
   far from ideal from a scalability perspective but it does guarantee
   routing consistency and correctness. A path selection mode that
   allows better control over scalability is the Advertise N paths mode,
   but this is susceptible to routing inconsistency. First, if the N
   paths do not include the best path from each neighbor AS group then
   route oscillation cannot be precluded. Second, if the advertising
   router (e.g. an RR) advertises N paths to peer_n and M paths to
   peer_m, and N < M, care must be exercised to ensure that all paths
   advertised to peer_n are included in the paths advertised to peer_m.
   This can be assured as long as the advertising router has strictly
   ordered all of its paths
