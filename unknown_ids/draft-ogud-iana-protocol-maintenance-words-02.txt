   protocols, but there are certain deficiencies in using them when it
   comes to protocol maintainability.  Protocols are maintained by
   either updating the core specifications or via changes in protocol
   registries.

   For example, protocols often use external algorithms to to provide
   security functionality such as cryptography.  Cryptographic
   algorithms frequently have limited life cycles as new algorithms are
   phased in to replace older algorithms.

   This document proposes standard terms to use in protocol registries
   and possibly in standards track documents to indicate the life cycle
   support of protocol features and operations.

Internet-Draft           Keywords IANA registry            November 2009


1.  Introduction

   The RFC series have been the main way to define Internet protocols
   and publish lists of related protocol parameters.  RFC 3232 [RFC3232]
   replaced the original document centered process with on-line protocol
   registries maintained by IANA.  In many cases these registries are
   "write-once" i.e. new things are added; in other cases the
   requirements of a protocol implementation changes over time.  This
   document is aimed at the second case.

   This document is motivated by the experiences of the editors in
   trying to maintain registries for DNS and DNSSEC.  For example, DNS
   defines a registry for hash algorithms used for a message
   authentication scheme called TSIG [RFC2845], the first entry in that
   registry was for HMAC-MD5.  The DNSEXT working group decided to try
   to decrease the number of algorithms listed in the registry and add a
   column to the registry listing the requirements level for each one.
   Upon reading that HMAC-MD5 was tagged as "OBSOLETE" a firestorm
   started.  It was interpreted as the DNS community making a statement
   on the status of HMAC-MD5 for all uses.  While the document was
   definitely overreaching in its specification, the point remained
   there was no standard way to tag different requirements levels in
   protocol registries.

   In the crypto community there has been some attempts to indicate
   emerging and retiring algorithms by adding + or - to RFC 2119 words
   RFC 4835 [RFC4835], SHOULD+ is to be interpreted as "SHOULD for now,
   expected to be MUST soon".  MUST- indicates that the currently
   required algorithm or feature might be retired sometime in the near
   future.  This has traditionally been accomplished by adding a
   terminology section to each document.  A now expired draft
   (draft-hoffman-additional-key-words) attempted to establish these
   additions as new keywords but was never fully adopted.  This document
   attempts to revive this effort.  This document adds to and updates
   the labels defined in RFC 5226 [RFC5226] as well.

   In this document when we say "registry" we mean both "IANA registry"
   and RFC's specifying (or updating) a protocol and its parameters.

1.1.  Implementation vs. Operations requirements

   It is common that before a new technology is considered "useful" it
   has to gain widespread deployment.  Thus it makes sense to have
   different levels of RFC 2119 words requirement on implementations
   than on operations.

   In a world of protocol maintenance when something is being 'retired'
   it is nice if operations can easily migrate to a newer functionality.

   This document includes certain extra requirements on implementations
   during the phase-out of a functionality.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY" in this document are
   to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Proposed requirement words for IANA protocol registries

   The words below are expected to be in a separate column in the
   Registries indicating what support implementations are expected to
   provide for each functionality.

3.1.  MANDATORY

   This is the strongest requirement and for an implementation to ignore
   it there MUST be a valid and serious reason.

   Implementations:  To be considered compliant, all implementations
      MUST support this registry entry.
   Operations:  To be considered compliant, operations MUST use at least
      one of the mandatory entries and SHOULD be able to use all of the
      MANDATORY entries.
   Note 1:  There can be more than one MANDATORY requirement.
   Note 2:  The requirement applies only to new or future
      implementations on the day the requirement is released.  In many
      cases existing implementations can become compliant via software
      upgrade or point release.

3.2.  OPTIONAL

   Implementations:  Any implementation MAY or MAY NOT support this
      entry in the protocol registry.  The presence or omission of this
      MUST NOT be used to judge implementations on standards compliance.
   Operations:  Any use of this registry entry in operation is
      supported, ignoring or rejecting requests using this protocol
      component MUST NOT be used as bases for asserting lack of
      compliance.
   Note 1:  Optional is taken to mean that the given functionality MAY
      or MAY NOT be supported by an implementation or a given operation
      MAY or MAY NOT be used.

Internet-Draft           Keywords IANA registry            November 2009


3.3.  OBSOLETE

   Implementations:  New implementations SHOULD NOT support this
      functionality.
   Operations:  Any use of this functionality in operation MUST be
      phased out.
   Note:  This is the most dangerous term of the requirements words as
      it is easy to read too much into this term.  The intent is to
      express the following:
      *  This functionality is not needed/desired anymore by the given
         protocol.  This is not to say that this particular
         functionality should be obsoleted by other protocols that use
         the same (or similar) functionality.

3.4.  ENCOURAGED

   This word is added to the registry entry when new functionality is
   added and before it is safe to rely solely on it.  Protocols that
   have the ability to negotiate capabilities MAY NOT need this state.

   Implementations:  This functionality SHOULD be supported by
      implementations.
   Operations:  This functionality SHOULD NOT be immediately deployed as
      part of normal operations.  This functionality SHOULD be tested in
      a controlled environment to measure the quality and readiness of
      the functionality and gain operationally experience.  Operators
      can expect functionality marked ENCOURAGED to become MANDATORY at
      some point in the future unless a significant problem is
      encountered during early deployments.
   Note1:  In broadcast protocols like BGP and DNS there is no way for
      an originator of a message to know the capabilities of all
      recipients.  In these cases the requirement for support ought to
      be placed on implementations before the functionality is used in
      operations to guarantee maximum acceptance of the messages.
   Note2:  In some cases this requires having both "new" and "old"
      algorithms in use at the same time.  In this case the new
      functionality can be used before a high percentage of deployment
      of the new functionality has taken place.
   Note3:  In protocols that negotiate which functionality to use, there
      is no reason to place different requirement on operations other
      than list of accepted functionality SHOULD contain at least one
      MANDATORY functionality.

3.5.  DISCOURAGED

   This requirement is placed on an existing function that is being
   phased out.

Internet-Draft           Keywords IANA registry            November 2009


   Implementations:  Implementations MUST support this functionality,
      and SHOULD provide features to migrate to a MANDATORY
      functionality.  The use of this functionality SHOULD NOT be used
      as default behavior.
   Operations:  Operations SHOULD phase out any use of this
      functionality.
   Note:  This is the strongest signal to the community that this
      functionality is no longer considered best practice.  Some time
      after the functionality enters this state, it will migrate to
      OBSOLETE.

3.6.  RESERVED

   Sometimes there is a need to reserve certain values to avoid problems
   such as values that have been used in implementations but were never
   formally registered.  In other cases reserved values are magic
   numbers that may be used in the future as escape valves if the number
   space becomes too small.

   Implementations:  Implementations MUST NOT use any RESERVED values
      for implementation specific processing.
   Operations:  MUST NOT be used, any implementation in use that uses
      this code SHOULD be upgraded/retired.

3.7.  AVAILABLE

   This is a value that can be allocated by IANA at any time.
   Implementations:  Implementations SHOULD NOT use these values for
      implementation specific processing.
   Operations:  Any implementation claiming to know the meaning of this
      unallocated code MUST NOT be used.


4.  Protocol Registry Maintenance

   In theory the process to change the status of a protocol field should
   be the same as reserving a new field.  In practice this is going to
   be burdensome, as there is a chance the IESG will have to process
   many documents that are simply saying "Value X in Registry Y is now
   Mandatory" (or similar).

   For this reason we propose that it be possible to make reservations
   and have a change in that reservation to take place at a defined date
   in the future.  This is a change to the static labels defined in
   Section 4 of [RFC5226] to include a defined lifetime for certain
   registry entries.  For example, a document could say:

      Value X in registry Y is "ENCOURAGED".  On June 1st 2020 this
      value is to become "MANDATORY".

   or Value X in registry Y is "DISCOURAGED".  On June 1st 2020 this
      value is to become "OBSOLETE".

   or Value X in registry Y is "RESERVED" until June 1st 2020 when this
      value becomes "AVAILABLE".

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a set of terms to indicate the status of
   features in protocol implementations and operations.  It is not meant
   to be a discussion on feature or operation superiority or provide a
   means to measure the usefulness of a feature.  It is hoped that by
   extending the RFC 2119 words to be more applicable for protocol
   maintenance, the overall security of the Internet is improved.
