Internet-Draft         LDP IGP Synchronization             November 2009 
                        for broadcast networks 
    
Abstract 

   [LDP-IGP-SYNC] describes a mechanism to prevent black-holing traffic 
   (e.g. VPN) when IGP is operational on a link but LDP is not. If this 
   mechanism is applied to broadcast links that have more than one 
   LDP/IGP peer, the cost-out procedure can only be applied to the link 
   as a whole but not an individual peer. When a new LDP peer comes up 
   on a broadcast network, this can result in loss of traffic through 
   other established peers on that network. This document describes a 
   mechanism to address that use-case without dropping traffic. The 
   mechanism does not introduce any protocol changes.

1. Introduction 

   In [LDP-IGP-SYNC], when LDP is not fully operational on a link, IGP 
   advertises the link with maximum cost to avoid any transit traffic on 
   the link if possible. When LDP becomes operational i.e., all the 
   label bindings have been exchanged, the link is advertised with its 
   correct cost. This tries to ensure that all along the IGP shortest 
   path, the LDP LSP is available. 

   On broadcast links, IGP advertises a common cost to the broadcast 
   link, rather than a separate cost to each peer. The operation of the 
   mechanism in [LDP-IGP-SYNC] is analyzed using the sample topology of 
   Figure 1 below where routers A, B, C and E are attached to a common 
   broadcast network. Say all links in that topology have a cost of 1 
   except the link A-PE3 that has a cost of 10. The use-case when router 
   B's link to the broadcast network comes up is analyzed. Before that 
   link comes up, traffic between PE1 and PE2 flows along the bi-
   directional path PE1-A-C-D-PE2 and traffic between PE1 and PE3 flows 
   along the bi-directional path PE1-A-E-PE3.

                   Figure 1  LDP IGP sync on a broadcast network    

   In one interpretation of the applicability of [LDP-IGP-SYNC] to 
   broadcast networks, when a new router is discovered on a broadcast 
   network, that network should avoid transit traffic till LDP becomes 
   operational between all routers on that network. This can be achieved 
   by having all the attached routers advertise maximum cost to that 
   network. This should result in traffic that is being sent via that 
   broadcast network to be diverted. However, traffic might be 
   inadvertently diverted to the link that just came up. Till LDP 
   becomes operational, that traffic will be black-holed. In Figure 1, 
   when B's link to the broadcast network comes up and it is discovered 
   by routers A, C and E, then A, B, C and E can all start advertising 
   maximum cost to the broadcast network. Traffic between PE1 and PE3 
   will be unnecessarily diverted to the sub-optimal path PE1-A-PE3 
   until the maximum cost advertisement is stopped. More importantly, A 
   will have B as nexthop to PE2 and will not have a LDP LSP path to PE2 
   resulting in VPN traffic from PE1 to PE2 to be black-holed at A. 

   This interpretation has the additional complexity of ensuring that 
   the maximum cost advertisement should be reverted after LDP peering

Internet-Draft            LDP IGP Synchronization          November 2009 
                           for broadcast networks 
    

   between all the routers on the broadcast network is operational. This 
   is non-trivial and needs co-ordination between all the routers. 

   In another alternative interpretation of the applicability of [LDP-
   IGP-SYNC] to broadcast networks, only the router whose link to the 
   broadcast network comes up, advertises maximum cost for that link but 
   other routers continue to advertise the normal cost. In Figure 1 when 
   B's link to the broadcast network comes up, it advertises a high cost 
   to the broadcast network. After IGP has converged but the LDP peering 
   A-B is not yet operational, A will have B as the nexthop for PE2 and 
   will not have a LDP LSP path to PE2. VPN traffic from PE1 to PE2 will 
   be dropped at A. 

2. Conventions used in this document  

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. Proposed Solution 

   The problem described above exists because the link-state database 
   (LSDB) of the IGP does not describe a link coming up on a broadcast 
   network with a high bi-directional cost to all other routers on that 
   broadcast network. A broadcast network is advertised as a pseudo-node 
   containing a list of routers that the broadcast network is connected 
   to and the cost of all these connections from the pseudo-node to the 
   router is zero when computing SPF.  

   The solution proposed below removes the link that is coming up from 
   the LSDB unless absolutely necessary. Only the router whose link is 
   coming up plays a role in ensuring this. The other routers on the 
   broadcast network are not involved. The following text describes it 
   in more detail. 

   During the SPF algorithm execution, an additional computation is made 
   to detect an alternate path to reach a directly connected broadcast 
   network. If an alternate path does not exist, the interface is a 
   `cut-edge' in the topology.  

   When a router is ready to update its link-state advertisement (LSA) 
   with a link to the pseudo-node of a broadcast interface, it first 
   checks if that interface is a `cut-edge'. If it is not a `cut-edge' 
   then the updating of the LSA with that link to the pseudo-node is 
   postponed till LDP is operational with all the neighbors on that 
   broadcast interface. After LDP is operational, the LSA is updated

Internet-Draft              LDP IGP Synchronization        November 2009 
                             for broadcast networks 
    

   with that link to the pseudo-node (and the LSA is flooded). Note that 
   IGP and LDP adjacency bringup procedures are unchanged. 

   If the IGP is [OSPF], the Router-LSA is not updated with a `Link Type 
   2' (link to transit network) for that subnet, until LDP is 
   operational with all neighboring routers on that subnet.  

   Similarly, if the IGP is [ISIS], the `Link State PDU' is updated with 
   an `IS Reachability TLV' (or an `Extended IS Reachability TLV') to 
   the pseudo-node after LDP is operational with all neighboring routers 
   on that subnet. 

   A broadcast interface that is a `cut-edge' does not require special 
   handling. 

   Note that this solution can be introduced in a gradual manner in a 
   network without any backward compatibility issues. 

4. Scope of the solution 

   The method described in this document can be easily extended to 
   point-to-point links. However, an implementation may continue to 
   apply the method described in [LDP-IGP-SYNC] to point-to-point links 
   but apply the method described in this document to broadcast links. 
   Both methods can co-exist in a network. 

   This document is agnostic to the method that detects LDP to be 
   operational with a neighbor. It does not define any new method to 
   detect that LDP is operational. At the time of publishing this 
   document [LDP End-of-Lib] seems to be the preferred method. 

   Issues arising out of LDP not being configured on some routers or on 
   some interfaces are not specific to the method described in this 
   document and are considered outside the scope of this solution. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations 
   beyond those already described in [LDP-IGP-SYNC]. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document has no actions for IANA.
