            MPLS-TP Identifiers Following ITU-T Conventions
                draft-ietf-mpls-tp-itu-t-identifiers-00

Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to the identifiers to be used in
   the Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP).
   Identifiers that follow IP/MPLS conventions have already been
   defined.  This memo augments that set of identifiers for MPLS-TP
   management and OAM functions to include identifier information in a
   format typically used by the ITU-T.

1.  Introduction

   This document augments the initial set of identifiers to be used in
   the Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP)
   specified in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers].

   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers] defines a set of MPLS-TP transport and
   management entity identifiers to support bidirectional (co-routed and
   associated) point-to-point MPLS-TP LSPs, including PWs and Sections
   which follow the IP/MPLS conventions.

   This document specifies an alternative way to uniquely identify an
   operator/service provider based on ITU-T conventions and specifies
   how this operator/service provider identifier can be used to make the
   existing set of MPLS-TP transport and management entity identifiers,
   defined by [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers], globally unique.

   This document solely defines those identifiers.  The use of them and
   possible extensions to protocols to carry them is outside of scope of
   this document.

   In this document, we follow the notational convention laid out in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

3.  Uniquely Identifying an Operator - the ICC_Operator_ID

   In [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers] an operator is uniquely identified
   by the Global_ID which is based on the AS number of the operator.
   The ITU-T however traditionally identifies operators/service
   providers based on the ITU-T Carrier Code (ICC) as specified in
   [M1400].

   The ITU-T Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB) maintains a
   list of assigned ICCs [ICC-list].  Note that ICCs can be assigned to
   both, ITU-T members as well as non-members, all of which are
   referenced at [ICC-list].  The national regulatory authorities act as
   an intermediary between the ITU/TSB and operators/service providers.
   Amongst the things that the national authorities are responsible for
   in the process of assigning an ICC is to ensure that the Carrier
   Codes are unique within their country.

   The ICC itself is a string of one to six characters, each character
   being either alphabetic (i.e.  A-Z) or numeric (i.e. 0-9).
   Alphabetic characters in the ICC SHOULD be represented with upper
   case letters.

   Global uniqueness is assured by concatenating the ICC with a Country
   Code (CC).  The Country Code (alpha-2) is a string of two alphabetic
   characters represented with upper case letters (i.e., A-Z).  The
   Country Code format is defined in ISO 3166-1 [ISO3166-1].  Together,
   they form the ICC_Operator_ID.

4.  Use of the ICC_Operator_ID

   The ICC_Operator_ID is used as a replacement for the Global_ID as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers], i.e. its purpose is to
   provide a globally unique context for other MPLS-TP identifiers.

   As an example, an Interface Identifier (IF_ID) in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers] is specified as the concatenation of
   the Node_ID (a unique 32-bit value assigned by the operator) and the
   Interface Number (IF_Num, a 32-bit unsigned integer assigned by the
   operator that is unique within the scope of a Node_ID).  To make this
   IF_ID globally unique the Global_ID is prefixed.  This memo specifies
   the ICC_Operator_ID as an alternative format which, just like the
   Global_ID, is prefixed to the IF_ID.  Using the notation from
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers]:

   Global_ID::Node_ID::IF_Num

   is functionally equivalent to:

   ICC_Operator_ID::Node_ID::IF_Num

   The same substitution procedure applies to all identifiers specified
   in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers] except for the other alternatives
   mentioned in this document.

5.  ICC_Operator_ID-based MEG Identifiers

   The ITU-T format of MEG_IDs for MPLS-TP Sections, LSPs and
   Pseudowires is based on the globally unique ICC_Operator_ID.  In this
   case, the MEG_ID is a string of up to thirteen characters.  It
   consists of three subfields: the ICC (as described in Section 3),
   followed by a "/" (indicating the end of the ICC subfield), the
   Country Code (as described in Section 3) followed by a unique MEG
   code (UMC).  The UMC MUST be unique within the organization
   identified by the ICC.

   The ICC_Operator_ID-based MEG_ID may be applied equally to a single
   MPLS-TP Section, LSP or Pseudowires.

6.  ICC_Operator_ID-based MEP Identifiers

   ICC_Operator_ID-based MEP_IDs for MPLS-TP LSPs and Pseudowires are
   formed by appending a unique number to the MEG_ID defined in
   Section 5 above.  Within the context of a particular MEG, we call the
   identifier associated with a MEP the MEP Index (MEP_Index).  The
   MEP_Index is administratively assigned.  It is encoded as a 16-bit
   unsigned integer and MUST be unique within the MEG.  An
   ICC_Operator_ID-based MEP_ID is structured as:

   MEG_ID::MEP_Index

   An ICC_Operator_ID-based MEP ID is globally unique by construction
   given the ICC_Operator_ID-based MEG_ID's global uniqueness.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document extends an existing information model and, as such,
   does in itself not introduce new security concerns.  But, as
   mentioned in the security considerations section of the document that
   is being augmented, protocol specifications that describe use of this
   information model may introduce security risks and concerns about
   authentication of participants.  For this reason, the writers of
   protocol specifications for the purpose of describing implementations
   of this information model need to describe security and
   authentication concerns that may be raised by the particular
   mechanisms defined and how those concerns may be addressed.
