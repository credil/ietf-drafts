Abstract

   In this context of IPv4-IPv6 interconnection, several solutions have
   been proposed.  Some of these solutions require the definition of a
   new IPv4-mapped IPv6 address [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] which
   is used to represent an IPv4-only host in an IPv6 realms and the
   definition of a new mechanism called DNS64 for synthesizing a AAAA
   record, representing an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address in the DNS system,
   from the A record representing the IPv4 address of the IPv4-only host
   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64].  This IPv4-mapped IPv6 address, when managed
   by a translator, is to be considered as "fake" address in a DNS
   system since it is not necessarily assigned to any host's interface
   qualified by the associated name.  This document defines a new DNS
   record type and query type to identify IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] from native IPv6 ones.  The new
   record type and query type aim at helping the remote party to enforce
   its policies and avoid NAT64 boxes when possible.  Native addresses
   are to be preferred.

Requirements Language

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft               A64 DNS Record                 October 2009


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overall Context

   Due to IPv4 address depletion, several solutions have been proposed
   within IETF.  Among those solutions, IPv6 is the only perennial
   solution that should be implemented by service providers.
   Nevertheless, this implementation won't be in one shot and the co-
   existence between IPv4 and IPv6 should be managed for a while.  In
   addition to the co-existence issue, interconnection means to enable
   successful communications between IPv4 and IPv6 realms must be
   enforced.

   In this context, BEHAVE WG is currently specifying translator
   mechanisms which cover both stateful
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] and stateless
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] modes.  The proposed solutions require
   the definition of a new IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] which is used to represent an IPv4-
   only host in an IPv6 realm.  This type of addresses, when managed by
   a translator, is to be considered as "fake" address since it is not
   assigned to any host and can be confusing for the application.  The
   application querying for this address must be aware that the
   application running on the host represented by the IPv4-mapped IPv6
   address is connected through an IPv4 interface and may be not able to
   use a reference (e.g., [I-D.carpenter-behave-referral-object]) to an
   IPv6 address in the packet payload.

   When an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address is used as destination address, the
   traffic will be handled by a translator device and no direct
   communication would be possible.

1.2.  Contribution of this Draft

   The aforementioned "fake" addresses should not be confused with
   native IPv6 addresses in order to ease the enforcement of means to
   avoid translators whenever possible.  Notifying to the requesting
   host that the resolved address is not a native address but an IPv4-
   mapped IPv6 address (which is behind a NAT) would ease the local
   policies to prefer direct communications (i.e., avoid using IPv4-
   mapped IPv6 addresses when a native IPv6 address is available).

   For the sake of maintaining the reliability of the information
   maintained and sent by DNS and helping a given host to enforce
   policies to prefer native communications, a new record type is
   proposed (A64).  This record type stores only IPv4-mapped IPv6
   addresses.  A new query type A64 is also defined to request A64
   records or synthesised AAAA records as defined in

   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64].

1.3.  Backward Compatibility Issue

   The A64 record proposal suffers from DNS backward compatibility
   issue.  This issue is to be positioned in the following context:

   o  We are still in the early stages of IPv6 deployment;

   o  IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses will be used in various architecture
      configurations;

   o  DNS64 proposal as defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] may be used
      for serving dual-stack hosts.  DNS servers do not have any means
      to restrict the use of the service based on the requesting
      connectivity capabilities;

   o  [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] does not define how to configure static
      records using IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.

   o  Not all DNS servers are to be upgraded.  Only a subset of DNS
      servers may be updated to support the A64 records.

   o  A procedure for the discovery of these DNS A64-capable servers is
      described in [I-D.boucadair-behave-dns64-discovery].  When
      supported, only the appropriate DNS servers will be invoked.

   o  In some context, referral procedure should be aware about the type
      of the remote party.  This may help avoiding "some" ALGs in the
      path.


2.  IPv4-mapped IPv6 Record: A64

   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] discusses issues related to how an
   IPv4 host can be represented in the IPv6 realm.  A new address format
   is proposed.  To store an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format], a new record type is defined.

2.1.  A64 Record Type

   The A64 resource record type is a record specific to the Internet
   class that is destined to store a single IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.

   A type value is to be assigned by IANA.

2.2.  A64 Data Format

   Same data format for as AAAA records [RFC3596].

2.3.  A64 Query

   An A64 query for a specified domain name in the Internet class
   returns all associated A64 resource records in the answer section of
   a response.  As AAAA query type, a type A64 query does not perform
   additional section processing.

2.4.  Textual format of A64 records

   Same as for AAAA records [RFC3596].

2.5.  IP64.INT Domain

   In order to not pollute IP6.INT domain with IPv4-inferred records, a
   new domain SHOULD be defined.

   The same requirements as those of IP6.INT are to be taken into
   account for IP64.INT.

2.6.  Modifications to Existing Query Types

   All existing query types that perform type A and AAAA processing
   SHOULD be updated to perform type A, AAAA and A64 processing.

   Only AAAA records SHOULD be returned when AAAA only type is specified
   in the query.

   But during a transition phase, some hosts with IPv6-only connectivity
   may not be updated to perform A64 queries.  Specific IPv6 DNS
   servers, called "A64-compliant DNS servers", may be used to serve
   those hosts.  A64-compliant DNS servers may return an A64 record as a
   response to AAAA query if no AAAA record is available for the
   specified resource (A64 are considered as AAAA records.  This
   behaviour advocates for enhancing the chance for a communication to
   be established even through a translator).  A64-compliant DNS servers
   SHOULD not be used by dual-stack hosts which do not support A64 query
   type.  When A64 query type is received, only A64 record type MUST be
   returned.


3.  On the Need of a New Query type

   In the context of IPv4-IPv6 co-existence, new query type(s) would be
   required to achieve the following goals:

Internet-Draft               A64 DNS Record                 October 2009


   o  Retrieve both A64 and AAAA records by issuing one single query;

   o  Retrieve both IPv4 and IPv6 records (i.e., A, A64 and AAAA)
      records by issuing one single query;

   A candidate solution is described in [I-D.li-dnsext-ipv4-ipv6].


4.  IANA Considerations

   A record TYPE is to be assigned by IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security threat to the DNS
   system.
