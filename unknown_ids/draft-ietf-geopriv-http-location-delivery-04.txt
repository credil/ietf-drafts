Abstract

   A Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol (L7 LCP) is described that
   is used for retrieving location information from a server within an
   access network.  The protocol includes options for retrieving
   location information in two forms: by-value and by-reference.  The
   protocol is an extensible application-layer protocol that is
   independent of session-layer.  This document describes the use of

1.  Introduction

   The location of a Device is information that is useful for a number
   of applications.  The L7 Location Configuration Protocol (LCP)
   problem statement and requirements document [11] provides some
   scenarios in which the Device might rely on its access network to
   provide location information.  The LIS service applies to access
   networks employing both wired technology (e.g.  DSL, Cable) and
   wireless technology (e.g.  WiMAX) with varying degrees of Device
   mobility.  This document describes a protocol that can be used to
   acquire Location Information (LI) from a Location Information Server
   (LIS) within an access network.

   This specification identifies two types of location information that
   may be retrieved from the LIS.  Location may be retrieved from the
   LIS by-value, that is, the Device may acquire a literal location
   object describing the location of the Device.  The Device may also
   request that the LIS provide a location reference in the form of a
   location URI or set of location URIs, allowing the Device to
   distribute its LI by-reference.  Both of these methods can be
   provided concurrently from the same LIS to accommodate application
   requirements for different types of location information.

   This specification defines an extensible XML-based protocol that
   enables the retrieval of LI from a LIS by a Device.  This protocol
   can be bound to any session-layer protocol, particularly those
   capable of MIME transport.  This document describes the use of
   Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as a transport for the protocol.


2.  Conventions & Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   This document uses the terms (and their acronym forms) Access
   Provider (AP), Location Information (LI), Location Object (LO),
   Device, Target, Location Generator (LG), Location Recipient (LR),
   Rule Maker (RM) and Rule Holder (RH) as defined in RFC 3693, GEOPRIV
   Requirements [7] .  The terms Location Information Server (LIS),
   Access Network, Access Provider (AP) and Access Network Provider are
   used in the same context as defined in the L7 LCP Problem statement
   and Requirements document [11].  The usage of the terms, Civic
   Location/Address and Geodetic Location follows the usage in many of
   the referenced documents.

   In describing the protocol, the terms "attribute" and "element" are

   used according to their context in XML.  The term "parameter" is used
   in a more general protocol context and can refer to either an XML
   "attribute" or "element".


3.  Overview and Scope

   This document describes an interface between a Device and a Location
   Information Server (LIS).  This document assumes that the LIS is
   present within the same administrative domain as the Device (e.g.,
   the access network).  An Access Provider (AP) operates the LIS so
   that Devices (and Targets) can retrieve LI.  The LIS exists because
   not all Devices are capable of determining LI, and because, even if a
   device is able to determine its own LI, it may be more efficient with
   assistance.  This document does not specify how LI is determined.

   This document is based on the attribution of the LI to a Device and
   not specifically a person (end user) or Target, based on the premise
   that location determination technologies are generally designed to
   locate a device and not a person.  It is expected that, for most
   applications, LI for the device can be used as an adequate substitute
   for the end user's LI.  Since revealing the location of the device
   almost invariably reveals some information about the location of the
   user of the device, the same level of privacy protection demanded by
   a user is required for the device.  This approach may require either
   some additional assurances about the link between device and target,
   or an acceptance of the limitation that unless the device requires
   active user authentication, there is no guarantee that any particular
   individual is using the device at that instant.

   The following diagram shows the logical configuration of some of the
   functional elements identified in [7] and the LIS defined in [11] and
   where this protocol applies, with the Rule Maker and Target
   represented by the role of the Device.

   The interface between the Location Recipient (LR) and the Device
   and/or LIS is application specific, as indicated by the APP
   annotation in the diagram and it is outside the scope of the
   document.  An example of an APP interface between a device and LR can
   be found in the SIP Location Conveyance document [23].


4.  Protocol Overview

   The HELD protocol facilitates retrieval of location directly in the
   form of a PIDF-LO document (by-value) and indirectly as a Location
   URI (by-reference).  The policy that describes to whom, and how, LI
   is granted is outside the scope of this document and may be specified
   in separate specifications as required.  The Device must first
   discover the URI for the LIS for sending the HELD protocol requests
   as identified by the requirement in the L7 LCP problem statement and
   requirements [11].  The discovery methods are specified in [14].  The
   LIS uses the source IP address of the request sent from the Device as
   the identifier in determining the location of the device.  The use of

Internet-Draft                    HELD                      January 2008


   additional identifiers for the HELD protocol is outside the scope of
   this document.

4.1.  Location by Value

   Where a Device requires LI directly, it can request that the LIS
   create a PIDF-LO document.  This approach fits well with a
   configuration whereby the device directly makes use of the provided
   PIDF-LO document.  The details on the information that may be
   included in the PIDF-LO MUST follow the subset of those rules
   relating to the construction of the "location-info" element in the
   PIDF-LO Usage Clarification, Considerations and Recommendations
   document [10].  Further detail is included in the detailed protocol
   section of this document Section 6

4.2.  Location by Reference

   Requesting location directly does not always address the requirements
   of an application.  A Device can request a location URI instead of
   literal location.  A Location URI is a URI [20] of any scheme, which
   a Location Recipient (LR) can use to retrieve LI.  A location URI
   provided by a LIS can be assumed to be globally-addressable; that is,
   anyone in possession of the URI can access the LIS.  This does not in
   any way suggest that the LIS is bound to reveal the location
   associated with the location URI.  This issue is deemed out of scope
   for this document.  The merits and drawbacks of using a Location URI
   approach are discussed in [15].

4.3.  Device Identifiers, NAT and VPNs

   Use of the HELD protocol is subject to the viability of the
   identifier used by the LIS to determine location.  This document
   describes the use of the IP address of the Device as the identifier.
   When Network Address Translation (NAT), a Virtual Private Network
   (VPN) or other forms of address modification occur between the Device
   and the LIS, the location returned could be inaccurate.

   Not all cases of NATs introduce inaccuracies in the returned
   location.  For example, a NAT used in a residential Local Area
   Network (LAN) is typically not a problem.  The external IP address
   used on the Wide Area Network (WAN) side of the NAT is an acceptable
   identifier for all of the devices in the residence, on the LAN side
   of the NAT, since the covered geographical area is small.

   On the other hand, if there is a VPN between the Device and the LIS,
   for example for a teleworker, then the IP address seen by the LIS
   might not be the right address to identify the location of the
   Device.

4.3.1.  Devices and VPNs

   To minimize the impact of VPNs, Devices should perform their HELD
   query prior to establishing a VPN tunnel.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   discovery [14] and an initial query are performed before establishing
   the VPN.  If a Device performs the HELD query after establishing the
   VPN tunnel, the Device may receive inaccurate location information.

   Devices that establish VPN connections for use by other devices
   inside a LAN or other closed network may serve as a LIS, that
   implements the HELD protocol, for those other Devices.  Devices
   within the closed network are not necessarily able to detect the
   presence of the VPN and rely on the VPN device.  To this end, a VPN
   device should provide the address, of the LIS server it provides, in
   response to discovery queries.

   It could also be useful for a VPN device to serve as a LIS for other
   location configuration options such as Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP)[21] or Link Layer Discovery Protocol - Media Endpoint
   Discovery (LLDP-MED) [25].  VPN devices that serve as a LIS may
   acquire their own location using HELD.

4.3.2.  LIS Handling of NATs and VPNs

   In the cases where the Device uses a VPN connection or is behind a
   NAT that serves a large geographic area or multiple geographic
   locations (for example, a NAT used by an enterprise to connect their
   private network to the Internet), the LIS may not be able to return
   an accurate LI.  If the LIS cannot determine an accurate LI, it
   should not provide location information to the requesting device.
   The LIS needs to be configured to recognize identifiers that
   represent these conditions.

   LIS operators have a large role in ensuring the best possible
   environment for location determination.  The LIS operator needs to
   ensure that the LIS is properly configured with identifiers that fall
   within NATs and VPNs.  In order to serve a Device on a remote side of
   a NAT or VPN a LIS needs to have a presence on the side of the NAT or
   VPN nearest the Device.


5.  Protocol Description

   As discussed in Section 4, this protocol provides for the retrieval
   of location in the form of a PIDF-LO document and/or Location URI(s)
   from a LIS.  Three messages are defined to support the location
   retrieval: locationRequest, locationResponse and error.  Messages are
   defined as XML documents.

Internet-Draft                    HELD                      January 2008


   The Location Request (locationRequest) message is described in
   Section 5.2.  A Location Request message from a Device indicates
   whether location in the form of a PIDF-LO document (with specific
   type(s) of location) and/or Location URI(s) should be returned.  The
   LIS replies with a response (locationResponse), including a PIDF-LO
   document and/or one or more Location URIs in case of success, or an
   error message in case of an error.

   A MIME type "application/held+xml" is registered in Section 11.3 to
   distinguish HELD messages from other XML document bodies.  This
   specification follows the recommendations and conventions described
   in [18], including the naming convention of the type ('+xml' suffix)
   and the usage of the 'charset' parameter.

   Section 6 contains a more thorough description of the protocol
   parameters, valid values, and how each should be handled.  Section 7
   contains a more specific definition of the structure of these
   messages in the form of an XML Schema [12].

5.1.  Delivery Protocol

   The HELD protocol is an application-layer protocol that is defined
   independently of any lower layers.  This means that any protocol can
   be used to transport this protocol providing that it can provide a
   few basic features:
   o  The protocol must have acknowledged delivery.
   o  The protocol must be able to correlate a response with a request.
   o  The protocol must provide authentication, privacy and protection
      against modification.
   This document describes the use of a combination of HTTP [3], TLS [2]
   and TCP [16] in Section 8 .

5.2.  Location Request

   A location request message is sent from the Device to the LIS when it
   requires LI.  The type of LI that a Device requests is determined by
   the type of LI that is included in the "locationType" element.

   The location request is made by sending a document formed of a
   "locationRequest" element.  The LIS uses the source IP address of the
   location request message as the primary source of identity for the
   requesting device or target.  It is anticipated that other Device
   identities may be provided through schema extensions.  The successful
   response to a location request message is a document formed of a
   "locationResponse" element, unless the request fails, in which case
   the LIS MUST provide an error indication document.

   does not understand.

5.3.  Location Response

   The response to a Location request MUST contain a PIDF-LO and/or
   Location URI(s), depending upon the requested "locationType".

5.4.  Indicating Errors

   In the event of an error, the LIS MUST respond to the Device with an
   error document.  The error response applies to all request types and
   MUST also be sent in response to any unrecognized request.

   An error indication document consists of an "error" element.  The
   "error" element MUST include a "code" attribute that indicates the
   type of error.  A set of predefined error codes are included in
   Section 6.3.

   Error responses MAY also include a "message" attribute that can
   include additional information.  This information SHOULD be for
   diagnostic purposes only, and MAY be in any language.  The language
   of the message SHOULD be indicated with an "xml:lang" attribute.

   This section describes, in detail the parameters that are used for
   this protocol.  Table 1 lists the top-level components used within
   the protocol and where they are mandatory or optional for each of the

6.1.  "responseTime" Parameter

   The "responseTime" attribute MAY be included in a location request
   message.  The "responseTime" attribute includes a time value
   indicating to the LIS how long the Device is prepared to wait for a
   response and/or a purpose for which the Device needs the location.
   In the case of emergency services, the purpose of obtaining the LI
   could be either for routing a call to the appropriate PSAP or
   indicating the location to which responders should be dispatched.
   The values defined for the purpose, emergencyRouting and
   emergencyDispatch, will likely be governed by jurisdictional
   policies, and should be configurable on the LIS.

   The time value in the "responseTime" attribute is expressed as a non-
   negative integer in units of milliseconds.  The time value is
   indicative only and the LIS is under no obligation to strictly adhere
   to the time limit implied; any enforcement of the time limit is left
   to the requesting Device.  The LIS should provide the most accurate
   LI that can be determined within the specified interval for the
   specific service.

   The LIS may use the value of the time in the "responseTime" attribute
   as input when selecting the method of location determination, where
   multiple such methods exist.  If the "responseTime" attribute is
   absent, then the LIS should return the most precise LI it is capable
   of determining, with the time interval being implementation
   dependent.

6.2.  "locationType" Parameter

   The "locationType" element MAY be included in a location request
   message.  It contains a list of LI types that are requested by the
   Device.  The following list describes the possible values:

   any:  The LIS SHOULD attempt to provide LI in all forms available to
      it.  The LIS SHOULD return location information in a form that is
      suited for routing and responding to an emergency call in its
      jurisdiction.  The LIS MAY alternatively or additionally return a
      location URI.  If the "locationType" element is absent, this value
      MUST be assumed as the default.
   geodetic:  The LIS SHOULD return a geodetic location for the Target.
   civic:  The LIS SHOULD return a civic address for the Target.  Any
      type of civic address may be returned.
   locationURI:  The LIS SHOULD return a location URI for the Target.

   The LIS SHOULD return the requested location type or types.  The LIS
   MAY provide additional location types, or it MAY provide alternative
   types if the request cannot be satisfied for a requested location

   type.  A location URI provided by the LIS is a reference to the most
   current available LI, and the Target Device should understand that it
   is not a stable reference to a specific location.  The location types
   the LIS returns also depends on the setting of the optional "exact"
   attribute, as described in the following section.

   The "SHOULD"-strength requirement on this parameter is included to
   allow for soft-failover.  This enables a fixed client configuration
   that prefers a specific location type without causing location
   requests to fail when that location type is unavailable.  For
   example, a notebook computer could be configured to retrieve civic
   addresses, which is usually available from typical home or work
   situations.  However, when using a wireless modem, the LIS might be
   unable to provide a civic address and thus provides a geodetic
   address.

6.2.1.  "exact" Attribute

   The "exact" attribute MAY be included in a location request message
   when the "locationType" element is included.  When the "exact"
   attribute is set to "true", it indicates to the LIS that the contents
   of the "locationType" parameter MUST be strictly followed.  The
   default value of "false" allows the LIS the option of returning
   something beyond what is specified, such as a location URI when only
   a civic location was requested.

   A value of "true" indicates that the LIS MUST provide a location of
   the requested type or types or MUST provide an error.  The LIS MUST
   provide the requested types only.  The LIS MUST handle an exact
   request that includes a "locationType" element set to "any" as if the
   "exact" attribute were set to "false".

6.3.  "code" Parameter

   All "error" responses MUST contain a response code.  All errors are
   application-level errors, and MUST only be provided in successfully
   processed transport-level responses.  For example where HTTP is used
   as the transport, HELD error messages MUST be accompanied by a 200 OK
   HTTP response.

   HELD error responses may be one of the following tokens:

   requestError:  This code indicates that the request was badly formed
      in some fashion.

Internet-Draft                    HELD                      January 2008


   xmlError:  This code indicates that the XML content of the request
      was either badly formed or invalid.
   generalLisError:  This code indicates that an unspecified error
      occurred at the LIS.
   locationUnknown:  This code indicates that the LIS could not
      determine the location of the Device.
   unsupportedMessage:  This code indicates that the request was not
      supported or understood by the LIS.
   timeout:  This code indicates that the LIS could not satisfy the
      request within the time specified in the "responseTime" parameter.
   cannotProvideLiType:  This code indicates that the LIS was unable to
      provide LI of the type or types requested.  This code is used when
      the "exact" attribute on the "locationType" parameter is set to
      "true".

6.4.  "message" Parameter

   The "error" message MAY include a "message" attribute to convey some
   additional, human-readable information about the result of the
   request.  This message MAY be included in any language, which SHOULD
   be indicated by the "xml:lang", attribute.  The default language is
   assumed to be English.

6.5.  "locationURI" Parameter

   The "locationURI" element includes a single Location URI.  Each
   Location URI that is allocated by the LIS is unique to the device
   that is requesting it.  A "locationResponse" message MAY contain any
   number of "locationURI" elements.

   The "locationURI" elements MUST be in the form of a HELD: URI, which
   is defined following RFC3986 [20] and the associated URI Guidelines
   [22] recommendations, per the following ABNF syntax:

      HELD-URI = "held" ":" "//" [ location-id "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
             [ path-absolute ] [ uri-extensions ]

      location-id = token

      uri-extensions = "?" extension *(COMMA extension)

      extension = generic-param

      generic-param =  token [ EQUAL gen-value ]

      gen-value    =  token / host / quoted-string

      token =  1*(alphanum / "-" / "." / "!" / "%" / "*"

                        / "_" / "+" / "`" / "'" / "~" )


   The following summarizes the primary elements comprising the HELD-
   URI:

   host:  As defined in RFC3986 [20]
   port:  As defined in RFC3986 [20].  There is no unique port
      associated with location URIs.
   path-absolute  As defined in RFC3986 [20]
   location-id:  A token used to identify the locationURI uniquely to
      the device that is requesting it.
   extension:  To allow for future extensions of the information
      associated with locationURIs, for use by the LIS.

   The HELD: URI is not intended to be human-readable text, therefore it
   is encoded entirely in US-ASCII.  The following are examples of HELD:
   URIs:

     held://5432+379xyziou@ls.example.com
     held://thislocation@ls.example.com
     held://ls.example.com/thislocation
     held://9876abcde@ls.example.com/civic

   The URIs are case sensitive and exact equivalency is required for
   HELD-URI comparisons.  For example, in the above examples, although
   similar in information, the 2nd and 3rd URIs are not considered
   equivalent.

   A "locationURI" MUST NOT contain any information that could be used
   to identify the Device or Target.  It is recommended that a
   "locationURI" contain a public address for the LIS in the "host"
   component and an anonymous identifier, such as a local identifer or
   unlinked pseudonym, in the "location-id" component.  The "path-
   absolute" component is included to allow a LIS to more readily
   dereference the location, depending upon its implementation.

   Upon receipt of the "locationURI" in the response, the Device can
   then deference the location to obtain a PIDF-LO in a subsequent
   request to a LIS, as described in [24].  The following section
   discusses the "expires" attribute, which defines the length of time
   for which a specific HELD-URI is valid.

6.5.1.  "expires" Parameter

   The "expires" attribute is only included in a "locationResponse"
   message when a Location URI is included.  The "expires" attribute
   indicates the time at which the Location URI provided by the LIS will

   expire.

   Responses to Location requests for Location URIs MUST include the
   expiry time of the Location URI.  If a Device dereferences the
   location URI after the expiry time, it would be possible to get an
   entirely invalid location for that Device.

6.6.  "pidf-LO" Parameter

   A "pidf-LO" may be included in the "locationResponse" message when
   specific locationTypes (e.g., "geodetic" or "civic") are requested or
   a "locationType" of "any" is requested.  The details on the
   information that may be included in the PIDF-LO MUST follow the
   subset of those rules relating to the construction of the
   "location-info" element in the PIDF-LO Usage Clarification,
   Considerations and Recommendations document [10].  The LIS MUST
   follow those rules in generating the PIDF-LO in this case.  Per the
   GEOPRIV Location Object format specified in [8], the "entity" element
   MUST reflect the Target of the Location Information.  In addition,
   the default values for <retransmission-allowed> and <retention-
   expiry> as specified in [8] MUST be applied.  A default value of "no"
   SHALL be used for the <retransmission-allowed> element.  A default
   value of 24 hours SHALL be used for <retention-expiry> value of any
   generated PIDF-LO documents.  A LIS MAY provide a shorter value for
   <retention-expiry> but MUST NOT provide a value longer than 24 hours.

   Note that the PIDF-LO is not explicitly shown in the XML schema
   Section 7 for a location response message due to XML schema
   constraints.


7.  XML Schema

   This section gives the XML Schema Definition [12] of the
   "application/held+xml" format.  This is presented as a formal
   definition of the "application/held+xml" format.  Note that the XML
   Schema definition is not intended to be used with on-the-fly
   validation of the presence XML document.

8.  HTTP Binding

   This section describes the use of HTTP [3] as a transport mechanism
   for this protocol, which all conforming implementations MUST support.

   The request is carried in the body of an HTTP POST request.  The MIME
   type of both request and response bodies should be
   "application/held+xml".

   The LIS populates the HTTP headers so that they are consistent with
   the contents of the message.  In particular, the "expires" and cache
   control headers are used to control the caching of any PIDF-LO
   document or Location URIs.  The HTTP status code SHOULD indicate a
   2xx series response when a PIDF-LO document or Location URI is
   included.

   The use of HTTP also includes a default behaviour, which is triggered
   by a GET request, or a POST with no request body.  If either of these
   queries are received, the LIS MUST attempt to provide either a
   PIDF-LO document or a Location URI, as if the request was a location
   request.

   The implementation of HTTP as a transport mechanism MUST implement
   TLS as described in [4].  TLS provides message integrity and privacy
   between Device and LIS.  The LIS MUST use the server authentication
   method described in [4]; the Device MUST fail a request if server
   authentication fails, except in the event of an emergency.


9.  Security Considerations

   The Security Requirements for the Geopriv Location System [Editor's
   note: need to add explicit reference to this doc, BUT xml2rfc not

   threat model for the protocols that interface with a LIS.  The threat

   model for the HELD protocol assumes that the LIS exists within the
   same administrative domain as the Device.  The LIS requires access to
   network information so that it can determine Location.  Therefore,
   the LIS can use network information to protect against a number of
   the possible attacks.

   Specific requirements and security considerations for location
   acquisition protocols are provided in [11] including that the LCP
   MUST NOT assume prior network access authentication, which is
   addressed in Section 9.2

   An in-depth discussion of the security considerations applicable to
   the use of Location URIs and by-reference provision of LI is included
   in [15].

9.1.  Return Routability

   It is RECOMMENDED that Location Information Servers use return
   routability rather than requiring Device authentication.  Device
   authentication SHOULD NOT be required due to the administrative
   challenge of issuing and managing of client credentials, particularly
   when networks allow visiting users to attach devices.  However, the
   LIS MAY require any form of authentication as long as these factors
   are considered.

   Addressing information used in a request to the LIS is used to
   determine the identity of the Device, and to address a response.
   This ensures that a Device can only request its own LI.

   A temporary spoofing of IP address could mean that a device could
   request a Location URI that would result in another Device's
   location.  One or more of the follow approaches are RECOMMENDED to
   limit this exposure:
   o  Location URIs SHOULD have a limited lifetime, as reflected by the
      value for the expires element (Section 6.5.1).
   o  The network SHOULD have mechanisms that protect against IP address
      spoofing.
   o  The LIS SHOULD ensure that requests can only originate from within
      its administrative domain.
   o  The LIS and network SHOULD be configured so that the LIS is made
      aware of Device movement within the network and addressing
      changes.  If the LIS detects a change in the network, then all
      location URIs MUST be invalidated.

   The above measures are dependent on network configuration and SHOULD
   be considered with circumstances in mind.  For instance, in a fixed
   internet access, providers may be able to restrict the allocation of
   IP addresses to a single physical line, ensuring that spoofing is not

   possible; in such an environment, other measures may not be
   necessary.

9.2.  Transaction Layer Security

   All bindings for this protocol MUST ensure that messages are
   adequately protected against eavesdropping and modification.
   Bindings MUST also provide a means of authenticating the LIS.

   It is RECOMMENDED that all bindings also use TLS [2].

   For the HTTP binding, TLS MUST be used.  TLS provides protection
   against eavesdropping and modification.  The server authentication
   methods described in HTTP on TLS [4] MUST be used.


10.  Examples

10.1.   HTTP Example Messages

   The examples in this section show a complete HTTP message that
   includes the HELD request or response document.

   This example shows the most basic request for a LO.  This uses the
   GET feature described by the HTTP binding.  This example assumes that
   the LIS service exists at the URL "https://lis.example.com/location".

         GET /location HTTP/1.1
         Host: lis.example.com
         Accept:application/held+xml,
             application/xml;q=0.8,
             text/xml;q=0.7

   includes an empty "locationRequest" element.

11.4.  Error code Registry

   This document requests that the IANA create a new registry the HELD
   protocol including an initial registry for error codes.  The error
   codes are included in HELD error messages as described in Section 6.3
   and defined in the schema in the 'codeType' token in the XML schema
   in (Section 7)

   The following summarizes the requested registry:

   Related Registry:   Geopriv HELD Registries, Error codes for HELD
   Defining RFC:  RFC XXXX [NOTE TO IANA/RFC-EDITOR: Please replace XXXX
      with the RFC number for this specification.]
   Registration/Assignment Procedures:  New error codes are allocated on
      a first-come/first-serve basis with specification recommended.
   Registrant Contact:  IETF, GEOPRIV working group, (geopriv@ietf.org),
      Mary Barnes (mary.barnes@nortel.com).

   This section pre-registers the following seven initial error codes as
   described above in Section 6.3:

   requestError:  This code indicates that the request was badly formed
      in some fashion.
   xmlError:  This code indicates that the XML content of the request
      was either badly formed or invalid.
   generalLisError:  This code indicates that an unspecified error
      occurred at the LIS.
   locationUnknown:  This code indicates that the LIS could not
      determine the location of the Device.
   unsupportedMessage:  This code indicates that the request was not
      supported or understood by the LIS.
   timeout:  This code indicates that the LIS could not satisfy the
      request within the time specified in the "responseTime" parameter.
   cannotProvideLiType:  This code indicates that the LIS was unable to
      provide LI of the type or types requested.  This code is used when
      the "exact" attribute on the "locationType" parameter is set to
      "true".

11.5.  URI Registration

   The following summarizes the information necessary to register the
   held: URI.  [NOTE TO IANA/RFC-EDITOR: Please replace XXXX with the
   RFC number for this specification in the following list.]

   URI Scheme Name:  held
   Status:  permanent
   URI Scheme syntax:  See section
   URI Scheme Semantics:  The held: URI is intended to be used as a
      reference to a location object.  Further detail is provided in
      Section 6.5 of RFCXXXX.
   Encoding Considerations:  The HELD: URI is not intended to be human-
      readable text, therefore they are encoded entirely in US-ASCII.
   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme:  The HELD protocol
      described in RFCXXXX and the GEOPRIV Location De-reference
      Protocol [24]
   Interoperability considerations:  This URI is intended for use as a
      parameter for the HELD protocol and this URI is also used as an
      input parameter for the GEOPRIV Location De-reference Protocol
      [24].  Refer to Section 6.5 in RFXXXX for further detail, in
      particular on the lack of permanence of a specific HELD: URI and
      thus the importance of using these URIs only within the specific
      contexts outlined in the references.
   Security considerations:  Section 9 in RFXXXX addresses the necessary
      security associated with the transport of location information
      between a Device and the LIS to ensure the privacy and integrity
      of the held: URI.  The schema for the held: URI allows for a
      random identifier in the form of a token in the URI Section 6.5 in
      RFCXXXX also recommends that the token be allocated such that it
      does not reveal any detail at all about the content of the PIDF-LO
      that it may indirectly reference.

14.  Changes since last Version

   NOTE TO THE RFC-Editor: Please remove this section prior to
   publication as an RFC.

   Changes from WG 03 to 04:

   1) Terminology: clarified in terminology section that "attribute" and
   "element" are used in the strict XML sense and "parameter" is used as
   a general protocol term Replaced term "HTTP delivery" with "HTTP
   transport".  Still have two terms "HTTP transport" and "HTTP
   binding", but those are consistent with general uses of HTTP.

   2) Editorial changes and clarifications: per Roger Marshall's and
   Eric Arolick's comments and subsequent WG mailing list discussion.

   3) Changed normative language for describing expected and recommended
   LIS behaviors to be non-normative recommendations in cases where the
   protocol parameters were not the target of the discussion (e.g., we
   can't prescribe to the LIS how it determines location or what it
   defines to be an "accurate" location).

   4) Clarified responseTime attribute (section 6.1).  Changed type from
   "decimal" to "nonNegativeInteger" in XML schema (section 7)

   5) Updated Table 1 in section 6 to only include top-level parameters
   and fixed some errors in that table (i.e., code for locationResponse)
   and adding PIDF-LO to the table.  Added a detailed section describing
   PIDF-LO (section 6.6), moving some of the normative text in the
   Protocol Overview to this section.

   6) Added schema and description for locationURI to section 6.5.
   Added IANA registration for HELD: URI schema.

   7) Added IANA registry for error codes.

   Changes from WG 02 to 03:

   1) Added text to address concern over use of IP address as device
   identifier, per long email thread - changes to section 3 (overview)
   and section 4 (protocol overview).

Internet-Draft                    HELD                      January 2008


   2) Removed WSDL (section 8 updated, section 8.1 and 10.4 removed)

   3) Added extensibility to baseRequestType in the schema (an oversight
   from previous edits), along with fixing some other nits in schema
   (section 7)

   4) Moved discussion of Location URI from section 5.3 (Location
   Response) to where it rightly belonged in Section 6.5 (Location URI
   Parameter).

   5) Clarified text for "expires" parameter (6.5.1) - it's an optional
   parm, but required for LocationURIs

   6) Clarified responseTime parameter: when missing, then the LCS
   provides most precise LI, with the time required being implementation
   specific.

   7) Clarified that the MUST use in section 8 (HTTP binding) is a MUST
   implement.

   8) Updated references (removed unused/added new).

   Changes from WG 01 to 02:

   1) Updated Terminology to be consistent with WG agreements and other
   documents (e.g., LCS -> LIS and removed duplicate terms).  In the
   end, there are no new terms defined in this document.

   2) Modified definition of responseTime to reflect WG consensus.

   3) Removed jurisdictionalCivic and postalCivic locationTypes (leaving
   just "civic").

   4) Clarified text that locationType is optional.  Fixed table 1 and
   text in section 5.2 (locationRequest description).  Text in section
   6.2 (description of locationType element) already defined the default
   to be "any".

   5) Simplified error responses.  Separated the definition of error
   response type from the locationResponse type thus no need for
   defining an error code of "success".  This simplifies the schema and
   processing.

   6) Updated schema/examples for the above.

   7) Updated Appendix A based on updates to requirements document,
   specifically changes to A.1, A.3 and adding A.10.

Internet-Draft                    HELD                      January 2008


   8) Miscellaneous editorial clarifications.

   Changes from WG 00 to 01:

   1) heldResponse renamed to locationResponse.

   2) Changed namespace references for the PIDF-LO geoShape in the
   schema to match the agreed GML PIDF-LO Geometry Shape Application
   Schema.

   3) Removed "options" element - leaving optionality/extensibility to
   XML mechanisms.

   4) Changed error codes to be enumerations and not redefinitions of
   HTTP response codes.

   5) Updated schema/examples for the above and removed some remnants of
   the context element.

   6) Clarified the definition of "Location Information (LI)" to include
   a reference to the location (to match the XML schema and provide
   consistency of usage throughout the document).  Added an additional
   statement in section 7.2 (locationType) to clarify that LCS MAY also
   return a Location URI.

   7) Modifed the definition of "Location Configuration Server (LCS)" to
   be consistent with the current definiton in the requirements
   document.

   8) Updated Location Response (section 6.3) to remove reference to
   context and discuss the used of a local identifier or unlinked
   pseudonym in providing privacy/security.

   9) Clarified that the source IP address in the request is used as the
   identifier for the target/device for the HELD protocol as defined in
   this document.

   10) Miscellaneous editorial clarifications.

Internet-Draft                    HELD                      January 2008


Appendix A.  HELD Compliance to IETF LCP requirements

   This appendix describes HELD's compliance to the requirements
   specified in the [11].

A.1.  L7-1: Identifier Choice

   "The L7 LCP MUST be able to carry different identifiers or MUST
   define an identifier that is mandatory to implement.  Regarding the
   latter aspect, such an identifier is only appropriate if it is from
   the same realm as the one for which the location information service
   maintains identifier to location mapping."

   COMPLY

   HELD uses the IP address of the location request message as the
   primary source of identity for the requesting device or target.  This
   identity can be used with other contextual network information to
   provide a physical location for the Target for many network
   deployments.  There may be network deployments where an IP address
   alone is insufficient to identify a Target in a network.  However,
   any necessary identity extensions for these networks is beyond the
   scope of this document.

A.2.  L7-2: Mobility Support

   "The GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol MUST support a
   broad range of mobility from devices that can only move between
   reboots, to devices that can change attachment points with the impact
   that their IP address is changed, to devices that do not change their
   IP address while roaming, to devices that continuously move by being
   attached to the same network attachment point."

   COMPLY

   Mobility support is inherently a characteristic of the access network
   technology and HELD is designed to be access network agnostic.
   Consequently HELD complies with this requirement.  In addition HELD
   provides specific support for mobile environments by providing an
   optional responseTime attribute in location request messages.
   Wireless networks often have several different mechanisms at their
   disposal for position determination (e.g.  Assisted GPS versus
   location based on serving base station identity), each providing
   different degrees of accuracy and taking different amounts of time to
   yield a result.  The responseTime parameter provides the LIS with a
   criterion which it can use to select a location determination
   technique.

Internet-Draft                    HELD                      January 2008


A.3.  L7-3: ASP and Access Network Provider Relationship

   "The design of the L7 LCP MUST NOT assume a business or trust
   relationship between the Application Service Provider (ASP) and the
   Access Network Provider.  Requirements for resolving a reference to
   location information are not discussed in this document."

   COMPLY

   HELD describes a location acquisition protocol and has no
   dependencies on the business or trust relationship between the ASP
   and the Access Network Provider.  Location acquisition using HELD is
   subject to the restrictions described in Section 9.

A.4.  L7-4: Layer 2 and Layer 3 Provider Relationship

   "The design of the GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol
   MUST assume that there is a trust and business relationship between
   the L2 and the L3 provider.  The L3 provider operates the LIS and
   needs to obtain location information from the L2 provider since this
   one is closest to the end host.  If the L2 and L3 provider for the
   same host are different entities, they cooperate for the purposes
   needed to determine end system locations."

   COMPLY

   HELD was specifically designed with this model in mind and readily
   allows itself to chaining requests between operators without a change
   in protocol being required.  HELD is a webservices protocol it can be
   bound to transports other than HTTP.  Using o offers the option of
   high request throughput over a dedicated connection between an L3
   provider and an L2 provider without incurring the serial restriction
   imposed by HTTP.  This is less easy to do with protocols that do not
   decouple themselves from the transport.

A.5.  L7-5: Legacy Device Considerations

   "The design of the GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol
   MUST consider legacy residential NAT devices and NTEs in an DSL
   environment that cannot be upgraded to support additional protocols,
   for example to pass additional information through DHCP."

   COMPLY

   HELD is an application protocol and operates on top of IP.  A HELD
   request from a host behind a residential NAT will traverse the NAT
   acquiring the external address of the home router.  The location
   provided to the host therefore will be the address of the home router

Internet-Draft                    HELD                      January 2008


   in this circumstance.  No changes are required to the home router in
   order to support this function, HELD was designed specifically to
   address this deployment scenario.

A.6.  L7-6: VPN Awareness

   "The design of the GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol
   MUST assume that at least one end of a VPN is aware of the VPN
   functionality.  In an enterprise scenario, the enterprise side will
   provide the LIS used by the client and can thereby detect whether the
   LIS request was initiated through a VPN tunnel."

   COMPLY

   HELD does not preclude a LIS on the far end of a VPN tunnel being
   aware that the client request is occurring over that tunnel.  It also
   does not preclude a client device from accessing a LIS serving the
   local physical network and subsequently using the location
   information with an application that is accessed over a VPN tunnel.

A.7.  L7-7: Network Access Authentication

   "The design of the GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol
   MUST NOT assume prior network access authentication."

   COMPLY

   HELD makes no assumptions about prior network access authentication.
   HELD strongly recommends the use of TLS with server-side certificates
   for communication between the end-point and the LIS.  There is no
   requirement for the end-point to authenticate with the LIS.

A.8.  L7-8: Network Topology Unawareness

   "The design of the GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol
   MUST NOT assume end systems being aware of the access network
   topology.  End systems are, however, able to determine their public
   IP address(es) via mechanisms such as STUN or NSIS NATFW NSLP."

   COMPLY

   HELD makes no assumption about the network topology.  HELD doesn't
   require that the device know its external IP address, except where
   that is required for discovery of the LIS.

A.9.  L7-9: Discovery Mechanism

   "The L7 LCP MUST define a single mandatory to implement discovery
   mechanism."

   COMPLY

   HELD uses the discovery mechanism in [14].

A.10.  L7-10: PIDF-LO Creation

   "When a LIS creates a PIDF-LO per RFC 4119 then it MUST put the
   <geopriv> element into the <device> element of the presence document
   (see RFC 4479).  This ensures that the resulting PIDF-LO document,
   which is subsequently distributed to other entities, conforms to the
   rules outlined in ". [10]

   COMPLY

   HELD protocol overview (Section 4 ) describes the requirements on the
   LIS in creating the PIDF-LO and prescribes that the PIDF-LO generated
   by the LIS MUST conform to [10].
