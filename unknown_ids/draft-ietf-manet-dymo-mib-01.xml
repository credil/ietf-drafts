      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information
      Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the
      Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects for
      configuring aspects of a Dynamic MANET On-demand (DYMO) routing

      <t>For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the
      current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to
      section 7 of RFC 3410 <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
      the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
      accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects
      in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of
      Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB module that is
      compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 <xref
      target="RFC2578"></xref>, STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref
      target="RFC2579"></xref> and STD 58, RFC 2580 <xref

    </section>





    <section title="Overview">

      <t>The Dynamic MANET On-demand (DYMO) routing protocol <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-manet-dymo" /> is intended for use by mobile
      nodes in wireless, multihop networks.  DYMO determines unicast
      routes among DYMO routers within the network in an on-demand
      fashion, offering improved convergence in dynamic
      topologies.</t>

      <t>A DYMO routers' MIB contains DYMO process configuration
      parameters (e.g. interfaces), state information (e.g.  sequence
      number), performance counters (e.g. number of control messages),
      and notifications.</t>


      <section title="DYMO Management Model">
        <t>This section describes the management model for the DYMO
           routing protocol.</t>
      </section>    


      <section title="Terms">
        <t>The following definitions apply throughout this document:</t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects
             which are initialized to default settings or set
             through the management interface defined by this MIB.</t>
          <t>Tunable Configuration Objects - objects whose
             values affect timing or attempt bounds on the
             DYMO protocol.</t>
          <t>State Objects - automatically generated values which
             define the current operating state of the DYMO
             protocol process in the router.</t>
          <t>Statistics Objects - automatically generated values
             which help an administrator or automated tool to
             assess the performance of the DYMO protocol process
             on the router and the overall routing performance
             within the DYMO routing domain.</t>
        </list>
      </section>    

    </section>






    <section title="Structure of the MIB Module">
      <t>This section presents the structure of the DYMO
      MIB module. The objects are
      arranged into the following groups:</t>
      <list style='symbols'>
        <t>dymoMIBNotifications - defines the notifications associated with the
           DYMO MIB.  These are currently limited to notifications of interface
           state changes.</t>
        <t>dymoMIBObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the DYMO MIB.
           These objects are divided up by function into the following groups:</t>
        <list style='symbols'>
           <t>Configuration Group -   This group contains the DYMO objects that configure specific
              options that determine the overall performance and operation
              of the routing protocol for the router device and its interfaces.</t>
           <t>State Group -  Contains information describing the current state of the DYMO
              process such as the DYMO routing table.</t>
           <t>Statistics Group - Contains objects which help to characterize the
              performance of the DYMO process, typically statistics
              counters. There are two types of DYMO statistics: 
              global counters and per interface counters.</t>
        </list>
        <t>dymoMIBConformance - defines minimal and full conformance of implementations
           to this DYMO MIB.</t>
      </list>


      <section title="Textual Conventions">
        <!--Generic and Common Textual Conventions 
        can be found summarized at 
        http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-common-tcs.html-->
        <t>The textual conventions used in the DYMO MIB are as follows.
           The RowStatus textual convention is imported from 
           RFC 2579 <xref target="RFC2579"></xref>.
           The DymoInterfaceOperStatus is defined within the DYMO MIB.
           This contains the current operational status of the
           DYMO interface.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The Configuration Group">

        <t>The DYMO device is configured with a set of controls.
        The list of configuration controls for
        the DYMO device follow.</t>


        <t>Protocol Tuning Configuration Parameters:</t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>MSG_HOPLIMIT</t>

        </list>

        <t>Protocol Configuration Tables:</t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Interfaces - If DYMO_INTERFACES is set to other
             than all, then the DYMO router must be
             told which interfaces to run the DYMO
             protocol over.
             This is a table containing the interfaces 
             and associated information.</t>
          <t>Responsible Hosts - If RESPONSIBLE_ADDRESSES is set to other
             than self address, then the DYMO router must be configured
             with the set of host addresses for which
             it is to generate RREP messages.</t>
        </list>

      </section>


      <section title="The State Group">
        <t>The State Subtree reports current state information. 
           State information from the DYMO-MIB is contained in the 'Peers'
           Table.</t>

        <section title="Peers Table">
          <t>The DYMO peers table contains a list of recently known
             DYMO peer nodes participating in the rotuing within the
             DYMO MANET.  These entries age out after a preset time.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Routing Table">
          <t>The DYMO routing table contains DYMO specific information
             related to IP forwarding entries found in the node's
             IP forwarding table MIB.  DYMO additional information includes
             the sequence number associated with the DYMO message which
             generated the forwarding table entry.</t>
        </section>

      </section>



      <section title="The Statistics Group">
        <t>The Statisctics subtree reports primarily counters that
        relate to DYMO protocol activity.

    <section title="Relationship to Other MIB Modules">
      <t>[TODO]: The text of this section specifies the
      relationship of the MIB modules contained in this document to
      other standards, particularly to standards containing other MIB
      modules.  Definitions imported from other MIB modules and other MIB
      modules that SHOULD be implemented in conjunction with the MIB
      module contained within this document are identified in this section.</t>


      <section title="Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB">
        <t>The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB <xref target="RFC3418"></xref>
        is defined as being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply
        to the entity as a whole. The 'system' group provides identification
        of the management entity and certain other system-wide data. The
        DYMO-MIB does not duplicate those objects.</t>
      </section>


      <section title="Relationship to the IF-MIB">
        <t>[TODO] This section is included as an example; If the MIB module is
        not an adjunct of the Interface MIB, then this section should be
        removed.</t>
      </section>


      <section title="MIB modules required for IMPORTS">
        <t>[TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any
        module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a
        REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited someplace
        within the narrative sections. If there are imported items in the MIB
        module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not already cited, they
        can be cited in text here. Since relationships to other MIB modules
        should be described in the narrative text, this section is typically
        used to cite modules from which Textual Conventions are imported.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <!--[TODO] Remember to consider security from the start. -->

      <t>[TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
      contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
      those modules. This section MUST be patterned after the latest approved
      template (available at http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).
      Remember that the objective is not to blindly copy text from the
      template, but rather to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and
      then state/document the result of this evaluation.</t>

      <t></t>

      <t>[TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
      include the following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
      with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such objects
      may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
      The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
      proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
      These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>[TODO] writeable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive
          if abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
          security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
          example.</t>

          <t>[TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they
          are sensitive.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>[TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
      use the following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
      a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. So, if this MIB
      module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder
      can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct
      SNMP SET operations.</t>

      <t>[TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
      following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
      MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
      even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
      encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
      via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability: <list style="symbols">
          <t>[TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
          are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
          be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
          information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
          European Union if exposed to unathorized parties)</t>

          <t>[TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
          sensitive.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>[TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
      information should have. The following three boilerplate paragraphs
      should not be changed without very good reason. Changes will almost
      certainly require justification during IESG review.</t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
      if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
      and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
      module.</t>

      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
      provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>,
      section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
      mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
      RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
      cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to
      ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
      module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
      those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
      SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>[TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
      http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
      submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
      Considerations section. The requirements for this section vary depending
      what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section 3.5 for more
      information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module document.</t>

      <t>Option #2:</t>

      <t>Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
      requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and to
      record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry. When the assignment
      has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX" (here and in the
      MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove this note.</t>

      <t>Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
      MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual numbers.
      See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done in a draft
      MIB module.</t>

    <!-- References Section -->

    <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
   references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
   normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
   The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

   The standard MIB boilerplate available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html includes lists of
   normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
   specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
   modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
   then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
   in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
   IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
   SHALL point to the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
   policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
   text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
   documents containing imported definitions (other those already
   mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
   Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD point to the most recent
version of the specification in question.
