Abstract

   The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol is an XML-based
   protocol for mapping service identifiers and geodetic or civic
   location information to service URIs and service boundaries.  In
   particular, it can be used to determine the location-appropriate
   Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) for emergency services.

   The main data structure, the <mapping> element, used for
   encapsulating information about service boundaries is defined in the
   LoST protocol specification and circumscribes the region within which
   all locations map to the same service Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) or set of URIs for a given service.

   This document defines an XML protocol to exchange these mappings
   between two nodes.  This mechanism is designed for the exchange of
   authoritative <mapping> elements between two entities.  Exchanging
   cached <mapping> elements, i.e. non-authoritative elements, is
   possible but not envisioned.  In any case, this document can also be
   used without the LoST protocol even though the format of the
   <mapping> element is re-used from the LoST specification.

Internet-Draft                  LoST Sync                    August 2009


1.  Introduction

   The LoST (Location-to-Service Translation) protocol [RFC5222] maps
   service identifiers and geodetic or civic location information to
   service URIs.  The main data structure, the <mapping> element, used
   for encapsulating information about service boundaries is defined in
   the LoST protocol specification and circumscribes the region within
   which all locations map to the same service Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) or set of URIs for a given service.

   This mechanism is designed for the exchange of authoritative
   <mapping> elements between two entities (the LoST Sync source and the
   LoST Sync destination).

   The LoST Sync mechanism can, for example, be used in the LoST
   architecture, as specified in the [I-D.ietf-ecrit-mapping-arch].
   There, LoST servers act in different roles that cooperate to provide
   an ubiquitous, globally scalable and resilient mapping service.  In
   the LoST mapping architecture, LoST servers can peer, i.e., have an
   on-going data exchange relationship.  Peering relationships are set
   up manually, based on local policies.  A server can peer with any
   number of other servers.  Forest guides peer with other forest
   guides; resolvers peer with forest guides and other resolvers (in the
   same cluster); authoritative mapping servers peer with forest guides
   and other authoritative servers, either in the same cluster or above
   or below them in the tree.  Authoritative mapping servers push
   coverage regions "up" the tree, i.e., from child nodes to parent
   nodes.  The child informs the parent of the geospatial or civic
   region that it covers for a specific service.

   As an example consider the following two forest guides for two
   countries, country Foo and country Bar. Country Foo has only 5 PSAPs
   and the boundaries for fire, police and ambulance are identical.
   Country Bar has a large number of PSAPs but their emergency services
   architecture is designed in a way that all emergency calls are served
   by a small number of replicated and highly available Emergency
   Services Routing Proxies (ESRPs).  These ESRPs give outside countries
   the illusion of a single PSAP.  From a call routing point of view a
   ESRP receiving an emergency call performs location based routing to
   forward calls to one of the large number of PSAPs.

   Country Foo and country Bar utilize LoST Sync to keep their mappings
   up-to-date.  Every country is responsible for maintaining their own
   mapping information and hence they configure their LoST Sync nodes in
   a way that they exchange the respective mapping information.  In this
   case, the mapping data will be synchronized in both directions.
   Since the amount of data being exchanged is small and the expected
   rate of change is low the LoST Sync nodes are configured to always

   exchange all their mapping information whenever a change happens.

   This document defines two types of exchanges and those are best
   described by the exchange between two nodes as shown in Figure 1 and
   Figure 2.  The protocol exchange always runs between a LoST Sync
   source and a LoST Sync destination.  Node A in the examples of
   Figure 1 and Figure 2 has mappings that Node B is going to retrieve.
   Node A acts as the source for the data and Node B is the destination.

   The <getMappingsRequest> request allows a LoST Sync source to request
   mappings from a LoST Sync destination.

   Note that in the exchange illustrated in Figure 1 Node B issuing the
   first request and plays the role of the HTTP/HTTPS client (with HTTP
   as selected transport) and Node A plays the role of the HTTP/HTTPS
   server.

   The <pushMappingsRequest> exchange allows a LoST Sync source to push
   mappings to LoST Sync destination.  The assumption is being made that
   Node A and B have previously been configured in a way that they push
   mappings in such a fashion and that Node A maintains state about the
   mappings have to be pushed to Node B. No subscribe mechanism is
   defined in this document that would allow Node B to tell Node A about
   what mappings it is interested nor a mechanism for learning to which
   entities mappings have to be pushed.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document reuses terminology introduced by the mapping
   architecture document [I-D.ietf-ecrit-mapping-arch].

   Throughout this document we use the term LoST Sync source and LoST
   Sync destination to denote the protocol end points of the exchange.
   The protocol is referred as LoST Sync within the text.

3.  Querying for Mappings with a <getMappingsRequest> /
    <getMappingsResponse> Exchange

3.1.  Behavior of the LoST Sync Source

   A LoST Sync destination has two ways to retrieve mapping elements
   from a LoST Sync source.

   1.  A mechanisms that is suitable when no mappings are available on
       the LoST Sync destination is to submit an empty
       <getMappingsRequest> message, as shown in Figure 3.  The intent
       by the LoST Sync destination thereby is to retrieve all mappings
       from the LoST Sync source.  Note that the request does not
       propagate further to other nodes.

   2.  In case a LoST Sync destination node has already obtained
       mappings in previous exchanges then it may want to check whether
       these mappings have been updated in the meanwhile.  The policy
       when to poll for updated mapping information is outside the scope
       of this document.  The <getMappingsRequest> message with one or
       multiple <exists> child element(s) allows to reduce the number of
       returned mappings to those that have been updated and also to
       those that are missing.

   In response to the <getMappingsRequest> message the LoST Sync
   destination waits for the <getMappingsResponse> message.  In case of
   a successful response the LoST Sync destination stores the received
   mappings and determines which mappings to replace.

3.2.  Behavior of the LoST Sync Source

   When a LoST Sync source receives an empty <getMappingsRequest>
   message then all locally available mappings MUST be returned.

   When a LoST Sync source receives a <getMappingsRequest> message with
   one or multiple <exists> child element(s) then it MUST consult with
   the local mapping database to determine whether any of the mappings
   of the client is stale and whether there are mappings locally that
   the client does not yet have.  The former can be determined by
   finding mappings corresponding to the 'source' and 'sourceID'
   attribut where a mapping with a more recent lastUpdated date exists.

   Processing a <getMappingsRequest> message MAY lead to a successful
   response in the form of a <getMappingsResponse> or an <errors>
   message.  Only the <badRequest>, <forbidden>, <internalError>,
   <serverTimeout> errors, defined in [RFC5222], are utilized by this
   specification.  Neither the <redirect> nor the <warnings> messages
   are reused by this message.

3.3.  Examples

   The first example shows an empty <getMappingsRequest> message that
   would retrieve all locally stored mappings at the LoST Sync source.

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <getMappingsRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lostsync1"/>

          Figure 3: Example of empty <getMappingsRequest> message

   A further example request is shown in Figure 4 and the corresponding
   response is depicted in Figure 5.  In this example a request is made
   for a specific mapping (with source="authoritative.bar.example" and
   sourceId="7e3f40b098c711dbb6060800200c9a66") that is more recent than
   "2006-11-01T01:00:00Z".


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <getMappingsRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lostsync1">
       <exists>
           <mapping-fingerprint source="authoritative.bar.example"
           sourceId="7e3f40b098c711dbb6060800200c9a66"
           lastUpdated="2006-11-01T01:00:00Z">
           </mapping-fingerprint>
       </exists>
   </getMappingsRequest>


              Figure 4: Example <getMappingsRequest> Message

   The response to the above request is shown in Figure 5.  A more
   recent mapping was available with the identification of
   source="authoritative.bar.example" and
   sourceId="7e3f40b098c711dbb6060800200c9a66".  Only one mapping that
   matched source="authoritative.foo.example" was found and returned.

4.  Pushing Mappings via <pushMappings> and <pushMappingsResponse>

4.1.  Behavior of the LoST Sync Source

   When a LoST Sync source obtains new information that is of interest
   to its peers, it may push the new mappings to its peers.
   Configuration settings at both peers decide whether this
   functionality is used and what mappings are pushed to which other
   peers.  New mappings may arrive through various means, such as a
   manual addition to the local mapping database, or through the
   interaction with other entities.  Deleting mappings may also trigger
   a protocol interaction.

   The LoST Sync source SHOULD keep track to which LoST Sync destination
   it has pushed mapping elements.  If it does not keep state
   information then it always has to push the complete data set.  As
   discussed in Section 5.1 of [RFC5222], mapping elements are
   identified by the 'source', 'sourceID' and 'lastUpdated' attributes.
   A mapping is considered the same if these three attributes match.  It
   is RECOMMENDED not to push the same information to the same peer more
   than once.

   A <pushMappings> request sent by a LoST Sync source MUST containing
   one or more <mapping> elements.

   To delete a mapping, the content of the mapping is left empty.  The
   node can delete the mapping from its internal mapping database, but
   has to remember which peers it has distributed this update to.  The
   'expires' attribute is required, but ignored.  If an attempt is made
   to delete a non-existent mapping, the request is silently ignored.

4.2.  Behavior of the LoST Sync Destination

   When a LoST Sync destination receives a <pushMappingsRequest> message
   then a newly received mapping M' MUST replace an existing mapping M
   if all of the following conditions hold:

   1.  M'.source equals M.source

   2.  M'.sourceID' equals M.sourceID

   3.  M'.lastUpdated is greater than M.lastUpdated

   If the received mapping M' does not update any existing mapping M
   then it MUST be added to the local cache as an independent mapping.

   If a <pushMappingsRequest> message with an empty <mapping> element is
   received then a corresponding mapping has to be determined based on

   the 'source', 'sourceID' and 'lastUpdated' attributes.  If a mapping
   has been found then it MUST be deleted.  If no mapping can be
   identified then an <errors> response MUST be returned that contains
   the <notDeleted> child element.  The <notDeleted> element MAY carry a
   <message> element and MUST contain the <mapping> element(s) that
   caused the error.

   The response to a <pushMappingsRequest> request is a
   <pushMappingsResponse> message.  With this specification, a
   successful response message returns no additional elements, whereas
   an <errors> response is returned in the response message, if the
   request failed.  Only the <badRequest>, <forbidden>, <internalError>
   or <serverTimeout> errors defined in Section 13.1 of [RFC5222], are
   used.  The <redirect> and <warnings> messages are not used for this
   query/response.

   If the set of nodes that are synchronizing their data does not form a
   tree, it is possible that the same information arrives through
   several other nodes.  This is unavoidable, but generally only imposes
   a modest overhead.  (It would be possible to create a spanning tree
   in the same fashion as IP multicast, but the complexity does not seem
   warranted, given the relatively low volume of data.)

4.3.  Example

   An example is shown in Figure 6.  Image a LoST node that obtained two
   new mappings identified as follows:

   o  source="authoritative.example"
      sourceId="7e3f40b098c711dbb6060800200c9a66" lastUpdated="2008-11-
      26T01:00:00Z"

   o  source="authoritative.example"
      sourceId="7e3f40b098c711dbb606011111111111" lastUpdated="2008-11-
      01T01:00:00Z"

   These two mappings have to be added to the peer's mapping database.

   Additionally, the following mapping has to be deleted:

   o  source="nj.us.example" sourceId="123" lastUpdated="2008-11-
      01T01:00:00Z"

   In response, the peer performs the necessary operation and updates
   its mapping database.  In particular, it will check whether the other
   peer is authorized to perform the update and whether the elements and
   attributes contain values that it understands.  In our example, a
   positive response is returned as shown in Figure 7.

5.  Transport

   LoST Sync needs an underlying protocol transport mechanism to carry
   requests and responses.  This document defines an XML protocol over
   HTTP and over HTTP-over-TLS.  Client and server developers are
   reminded that full support of RFC 2616 HTTP facilities is expected.
   If clients or servers re-implement HTTP, rather than using available
   servers or client code as a base, careful attention must be paid to
   full interoperability.  Other transport mechanisms are left to future
   documents.  The selection of the transport mechanism will in most
   cases be determined through manual configuration although the usage
   of the U-NAPTR application defined in the LoST specification is
   possible.  In protocols that support content type indication, LoST
   Sync uses the media type application/lostsync+xml.

   When using HTTP [RFC2616] and HTTP-over-TLS [RFC2818], LoST Sync
   messages use the HTTP POST method.  The HTTP request MUST use the
   Cache-Control response directive "no-cache" to HTTP-level caching
   even by caches that have been configured to return stale responses to
   client requests.

   All LoST Sync responses, including those indicating a LoST warning or
   error, are carried in 2xx responses, typically 200 (OK).  Other 2xx
   responses, in particular 203 (Non-authoritative information) may be
   returned by HTTP caches that disregard the caching instructions. 3xx,
   4xx and 5xx HTTP response codes indicates that the HTTP request
   itself failed or was redirected; these responses do not contain any
   LoST Sync XML elements.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a protocol for exchange of mapping information
   between two entities.  Hence, the operations described in this
   document involve mutually-trusting LoST nodes.  These nodes need to
   authenticate each other, using mechanisms such as HTTP Digest
   [RFC2617], HTTP Basic [RFC2617] over TLS [RFC5246] or TLS client and
   server certificates.  Manual configuration for the setup of the
   peering relationships is required and hence the choice of the
   security mechanisms used between the two entities is a deployment
   specific decision.  In any case, it MUST be ensured that the two end
   points are authenticated and that a secure communication channel
   (i.e., an integrity protected exchange of data with the help of the
   TLS Record Layer) is setup to avoid the possibility of injecting
   bogus mappings.  If an adversary manages to inject false mappings
   then this could lead to denial of service attacks.  If the mapping
   data contains a URL that does not exist then emergency services for
   the indicated area are not reachable.  If all mapping data contains
   URLs that point to a single PSAP (rather than a large number) then
   this PSAP is likely to experience overload conditions.  If the
   mapping data contains a URL that points to a server controlled by the
   adversary itself then it might impersonate PSAPs.
