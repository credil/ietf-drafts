<section title="Introduction">

<t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"/> is
the subject of numerous specifications that have been produced by the
IETF. It can be difficult to locate the right document, or even to
determine the set of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP. Don't
Panic! <xref target="hh"/> This specification serves as a guide to the
SIP RFC series. It lists the specifications under the SIP
umbrella. For each specification, a paragraph or so description is
included that summarizes the purpose of the specification. Each
specification also includes a letter that designates its category in
the standards track <xref target="RFC2026"/>. These values are: </t>

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="S:">Standards Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, or
Standard)</t>

<t hangText="E:">Experimental</t>

<t hangText="B:">Best Current Practice</t>

<t hangText="I:">Informational</t>

</list>

<t>
The specifications are grouped together by topic. Typically, SIP
extensions fit naturally into topic areas, and implementations
interested in a particular topic often implement many or all of the
specifications in that area. There are some specifications which fall
into multiple topic areas, in which case they are listed more than
once. 
</t>

<t>
This document itself is not an update to RFC 3261 or an extension to
SIP. It is an informational document, meant to guide newcomers,
implementors and deployers to the SIP suite of specifications.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Scope of this Document">

<t>
It is very difficult to enumerate the set of SIP specifications. This
is because there are many protocols that are intimately related to
SIP and used by nearly all SIP implementations, but are not formally
SIP extensions. As such, this document formally defines a "SIP
specification" as:
</t>

<list style="symbols">

<t>Any specification that defines an extension to SIP
itself, where an extension is a mechanism that changes or updates in
some way a behavior specified in RFC 3261
</t>

<t>Any specification that defines an extension to SDP whose primary
purpose is to support SIP
</t>

<t>Any specification that defines a MIME object whose primary purpose
is to support SIP 
</t>

</list>

<t>
Excluded from this list are
requirements, architectures, registry definitions, non-normative
frameworks, and processes. Best Current Practices are included when
they normatively define mechanisms for accomplishing a task.
</t>

<t> The SIP change process <xref target="RFC3427"/> defines two types
of extensions to SIP. These are normal extensions and the so-called
P-headers (where P stands for "preliminary", "private", or
"proprietary", and the "P-" prefix is included in the header field
name) are meant to be used in areas of limited applicability.
P-headers cannot be defined in the standards track. For the most part,
P-headers are not included in the listing here, with the exception of
those which have seen general usage despite their P-header status.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Core SIP Specifications">

<t>
The core SIP specifications represent the set of specifications whose
functionality is broadly applicable. An extension is broadly
applicable if it fits into one of the following categories:
</t>

<list style="symbols">

<t>For specifications that impact SIP session management, the
extension would be used for almost every session initiated by a user
agent
</t>

<t>For specifications that impact SIP registrations, the extension
would be used for almost every registration initiated by a user agent
</t>

<t>For specifications that impact SIP subscriptions, the extension
would be used for almost every subscription initiated by a user agent
</t>

</list>

<t>In other words, these are not specifications that are used just for
some requests and not others; they are specifications that would
apply to each and every request that the extension is relevant
for. In the galaxy of SIP, these specifications are like towels <xref
target="hh"/>.
</t>

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="RFC 3261, The Session Initiation Protocol (S):">
<xref target="RFC3261">RFC 3261</xref> is the core SIP protocol
itself. RFC 3261 is an update to RFC 
2543 <xref target="RFC2543"/>. It is the president of the galaxy <xref
target="hh"/> as
far as the suite of SIP specifications is concerned. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3263, Locating SIP Servers (S):">RFC 3263 <xref
target="RFC3263"/> provides DNS procedures for taking a SIP URI, and
determining a SIP server that is associated with that SIP URI. RFC
3263 is essential for any implementation using SIP with DNS. RFC 3263
makes use of both DNS SRV records <xref target="RFC2782"/> and NAPTR
records <xref target="RFC2915"/>.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3264, An Offer/Answer Model with the Session
Description Protocol (S):"> <xref target="RFC3264">RFC 3264</xref>
defines how the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref
target="RFC4566"/> is used with SIP to negotiate the
parameters of a media session. It is in widespread usage and an
integral part of the behavior of RFC 3261.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3265, SIP-Specific Event Notification (S):"> <xref
target="RFC3265">RFC 3265</xref>
defines the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods. These two methods provide a
general event notification framework for SIP. To actually use the
framework, extensions need to be defined for specific event
packages. An event package defines a schema for the event data, and
describes other aspects of event processing specific to that
schema. An RFC 3265 implementation is required when any event package
is used.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3325, Private Extensions to SIP for Asserted Identity
within Trusted Networks (I):"> Though its P-header status implies that
it has limited applicability, RFC 3325 <xref target="RFC3325"/>, which
defines the P-Asserted-ID header field has been widely deployed. It is
used as the basic mechanism for providing secure caller ID services.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3327, SIP Extension Header Field for Registering
Non-Adjacent Contacts (S):"> RFC 3327 <xref target="RFC3327"/> defines
the Path header field. This field is inserted by proxies between a
client and their registrar. It allows inbound requests towards that
client to traverse these proxies prior to being delivered to the user
agent. It is essential in any SIP deployment that has edge proxies,
which are proxies between the client and the home proxy or SIP
registrar. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3581, An Extension to SIP for Symmetric Response
Routing (S):"> RFC 3581 <xref target="RFC3581"/> defines the rport
parameter of the Via header. It is an essential piece of getting SIP
through NAT. NAT traversal for SIP is considered a core part of the
specifications. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3840, Indicating User Agent Capabilities in SIP (S):">
<xref target="RFC3840">RFC 3840</xref> defines a mechanism for
carrying capability information about 
a user agent in REGISTER requests and in dialog-forming requests like
INVITE. It has found use with conferencing (the isfocus parameter
declares that a user agent is a conference server) and with
applications like push-to-talk.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4320, Actions Addressing Issues Identified with the
Non-INVITE Transaction in SIP (S):"> RFC 4320 <xref target="RFC4320"/>
formally updates RFC 3261, and modifies some of the behaviors
associated with non-INVITE transactions. These address some problems
found in timeout and failure cases.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4474, Enhancements for Authenticated Identity
Management in SIP (S):"> RFC 4474 <xref
target="RFC4474"/> defines a mechanism for providing a
cryptographically verifiable identity of the calling party in a SIP
request. Known as "SIP Identity", this mechanism provides an
alternative to RFC 3325. It has seen little deployment so far, but its
importance as a key construct for anti-spam techniques
makes it a core part of the SIP specifications.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC XXXX, Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User
Agent Identifiers (GRUU) in SIP (S):"> RFC XXXX <xref
target="I-D.ietf-sip-gruu"/> defines a mechanism for directing
requests towards a specific UA instance. GRUU is essential for
features like transfer and provides another piece of the SIP NAT
traversal story.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC XXXX, Managing Client Initiated Connections through
SIP (S):"> RFC XXXX <xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-outbound"/>, also known
as SIP outbound, defines important changes to the SIP registration
mechanism which enable delivery of SIP messages towards a UA when it
is behind a NAT. This specification is the cornerstone of the SIP NAT
traversal strategy.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4566, Session Description Protocol (S):"> <xref
target="RFC4566">RFC 4566</xref> defines a format for
representing multimedia sessions. SDP objects are carried in the body
of SIP messages, and based on the offer/answer model, are used to
negotiate the media characteristics of a session between users.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC XXXX, SDP Capability Negotiation (S):"> <xref
target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation">RFC XXXX</xref>
defines a set of extensions to SDP that allow for capability
negotiation within SDP. Capability negotiation can be used to select
between different profiles of RTP (secure vs. unsecure) or to
negotiate codecs such that an agent has to select one amongst a set of
supported codecs.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3388, Grouping of Media Lines in the Session
Description Protocol (S):"> <xref target="RFC3388">RFC 3388</xref>
defines a framework for grouping together media streams in an SDP
message. Such a grouping allows relationships between these streams,
such as which stream is the audio for a particular video feed, to be
expressed. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC XXXX, Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
(S):"> <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice">RFC XXXX</xref> defines a
technique for NAT traversal of media sessions for protocols that make
use of the offer/answer model. This specification is the IETF
recommended mechanism for NAT traversal for SIP media streams, and is
meant to be used even by endpoints which are themselves never behind a
NAT. A SIP option tag and media feature tag RFC XXXX <xref
target="I-D.ietf-sip-ice-option-tag"/> have been defined for use with
ICE. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3605, Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) Attribute in
the Session Description Protocol (SDP) (S):"> <xref
target="RFC3605">RFC 3605</xref> defines a way to explicitly signal,
within an SDP message, the IP address and port for RTCP, rather than
using the port+1 rule in the Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP) <xref
target="RFC3550"/>. It is needed for devices behind NAT and used by
ICE. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4916, Connected Identity in the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) (S):"> <xref
target="RFC4916">RFC 4916</xref> defines an
extension to SIP that allows a UAC to determine the identity of the
UAS. Due to forwarding and retargeting services, this may not be the
same as the user that the UAC was originally trying to reach. The
mechanism works in tandem with the SIP identity specification <xref
target="RFC4474"/> to provide signatures over the
connected party identity.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC XXXX, The use of the SIPS URI Scheme in the Session
	     Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	     (S):"> <xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-sips">RFC XXXX</xref>
	     revises the processing of the SIPS URI, originally
	     defined in RFC 3261, to fix many errors and problems
	     that have been encountered with that mechanism. 
</t>

<t hangText="Essential Corrections to SIP:"> A collection of fixes to
SIP that address important bugs and vulnerabilities. These include a
  fix requiring loop detection in any  proxy that

<section title="Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
Interworking">

<t>
Numerous extensions and usages of SIP related to interoperability and
communications with or through the PSTN. 
</t>

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="RFC 2848, The PINT Service Protocol (S):"> <xref
target="RFC2848">RFC 2848</xref> is one of
the earliest extensions to SIP. It defines procedures for using SIP to
invoke services that actually execute on the PSTN. Its main
application is for third party call control, allowing an IP host to
set up a call between two PSTN endpoints. PINT has a relatively narrow
focus and has not seen widespread deployment.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3910, The SPIRITS Protocol (S):"> Continuing the trend
of naming PSTN related extensions with alcohol references, SPIRITS
<xref target="RFC3910"/> defines the inverse of PINT. It allows a
switch in the PSTN to ask an IP element about how to proceed with call
waiting. It was developed primarily to support Internet Call Waiting
(ICW). Perhaps the next specification will be called the Pan Galactic
Gargle Blaster <xref target="hh"/>.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3372, SIP for Telephones (SIP-T): Context and
Architectures (I):"> SIP-T <xref target="RFC3372"/> defines a mechanism
for using SIP between pairs of PSTN gateways. Its essential idea is to
tunnel ISUP signaling between the gateways in the body of SIP
messages. SIP-T motivated the development of INFO <xref
target="RFC2976"/>. SIP-T has seen widespread implementation.  </t>

<t hangText="RFC 3398, ISUP to SIP Mapping (S):"> RFC 3398 <xref
target="RFC3398"/> defines how to do protocol mapping from the SS7
ISDN User Part (ISUP) signaling to SIP. It is widely used in SS7 to
SIP gateways and is part of the SIP-T framework.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3578, Mapping of ISUP Overlap Signaling to SIP (S):"> RFC
3578 <xref target="RFC3578"/> defines a mechanism to map overlap
dialing into SIP. This specification is widely regarded as the ugliest
SIP specification, as the introduction to the specification itself
advises that it has many problems. Overlap signaling (the practice of
sending digits into the network as dialed instead of waiting for
complete collection of the called party number) is largely
incompatible with SIP at some fairly fundamental levels. That said,
RFC 3578 is mostly harmless and has seen some usage.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3960, Early Media and Ringtone Generation in SIP
(I):"> <xref target="RFC3960">RFC 3960</xref> defines some guidelines
for handling early media - the practice of sending media from the
called party towards the caller - prior to acceptance of the
call. Early media is generated only from the PSTN.  </t>

<t hangText="RFC 3959, Early Session Disposition Type for the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) (S):"> <xref target="RFC3959">RFC
3959</xref> defines a new session disposition type for use with early
media. It indicates that the SDP in the body is for a special early
media session.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3204, MIME Media Types for ISUP and QSIG Objects
(S):"> <xref target="RFC3204">RFC 3204</xref> defines MIME objects for
representing SS7 signaling messages. These are carried in the body of
SIP messages when SIP-T is used.
</t>

</list>

</section>

<section title="General Purpose Infrastructure Extensions">

<t>
These extensions are general purpose enhancements to SIP, SDP and MIME that can
serve a wide variety of uses. However, they are not as widely used or
as essential as the core specifications. 
</t>

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="RFC 3262, Reliability of Provisional Responses in SIP (S):">
SIP defines two types of responses to a request - final and
provisional. Provisional responses are numbered from 100 to 199. In
SIP, these responses are not sent reliably. This choice was made in
RFC 2543 since the messages were meant to just be truly informational,
and rendered to the user. However, subsequent work on PSTN
interworking demonstrated a need to map provisional responses to PSTN
messages that needed to be sent reliably. RFC 3262 <xref
target="RFC3262"/> was developed to allow reliability of provisional
responses. The specification defines the PRACK method, used for indicating that
a provisional response was received. Though it provides a generic
capability for SIP, RFC 3262 implementations have been most common in
PSTN interworking devices. However, PRACK brings a great deal of
complication for relatively small benefit. As such, it has seen only
mild levels of deployment.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3323, A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) (S):"> RFC 3323 <xref target="RFC3323"/> defines the
Privacy header field, used by clients to request anonymity for their
requests. Though it defines numerous privacy services, the only one
broadly used is the one that supports privacy of the P-Asserted-ID
header field <xref target="RFC3325"/>.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3311, The SIP UPDATE Method (S):">RFC 3311 <xref
target="RFC3311"/> defines the UPDATE method for SIP. This method is
meant as a means for updating session information prior to the
completion of the initial INVITE transaction. It was developed
primarily to support RFC 3312 <xref target="RFC3312"/>.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 2976, The INFO Method (S):">RFC 2976 <xref
target="RFC2976"/> was defined as an extension to RFC 2543. It defines
a method, INFO, used to transport mid-dialog information that has no
impact on SIP itself. Its driving application was the transport of
PSTN related information when using SIP between a pair of
gateways. Though originally conceived for broader use, it only found
standardized usage with SIP-T <xref target="RFC3372"/>. It has been
used to support numerous proprietary and non-interoperable
extensions due to its poorly defined scope.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3326, The Reason header field for SIP (S):"> RFC 3326
<xref target="RFC3326"/> defines the Reason header field. It is used
in requests, such as BYE, to indicate the reason that the request is
being sent.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3420, Internet Media Type message/sipfrag (S):">
<xref target="RFC3420">RFC 3420</xref> defines a MIME object that
contains a SIP message fragment. Only certain header fields and parts
of the SIP message are present. For example, it is used to
report back on the responses received to a request sent as a
consequence of a REFER. 
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 3608, SIP Extension Header Field for Service Route
Discovery During Registration (S):"> RFC 3608 <xref target="RFC3608"/>
allows a client to determine, from a REGISTER response, a path of
proxies to use in requests it sends outside of a dialog. In many
respects, it is the inverse of the Path header field, but has seen
less usage since default outbound proxies have been sufficient in many
deployments.  </t>


<t hangText="RFC 3841, Caller Preferences for SIP (S):"> RFC 3841 <xref
target="RFC3841"/> defines a set of headers that a client can include
in a request to control the way in which the request is routed
downstream. It allows a client to direct a request towards a UA with
specific capabilities.  </t>

<t hangText="RFC 4028, Session Timers in SIP (S):"> RFC 4028 <xref
target="RFC4028"/> defines a keepalive mechanism for SIP signaling. It
is primarily meant to provide a way to cleanup old state in proxies
that are holding call state for calls from failed endpoints which were
never terminated normally. Despite its name, the session timer is not
a mechanism for detecting a network failure mid-call. Session timers
introduces a fair bit of complexity for relatively little gain, and
has thus seen little deployment.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4168, SCTP as a Transport for SIP (S):"> RFC 4168 <xref
target="RFC4168"/> defines how to carry SIP messages over the Stream
Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). SCTP has seen very limited usage
for SIP transport.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4244, An Extension to SIP for Request History
Information (S):"> RFC 4244 <xref target="RFC4244"/> defines the
History-Info header field, which indicates information on how a call
came to be routed to a particular destination. Its primary application
was in support of voicemail services. </t>

<t hangText="RFC 4145, TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session
Description Protocol (SDP) (S):"> <xref target="RFC4145">RFC
4145</xref> defines an extension to SDP for setting up TCP-based
sessions between user agents. It defines who sets up the connection
and how its lifecycle is managed. It has seen relatively little usage
due to the small number of media types to date which use TCP.
</t>

<t hangText="RFC 4091, The Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) Semantics
for the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework (S):">
<xref target="RFC4091">RFC 4091</xref> defines a mechanism for

<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="RFC 4488, Suppression of the SIP REFER Implicit
Subscription (S):"> RFC 4488 <xref
