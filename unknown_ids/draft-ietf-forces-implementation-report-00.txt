Abstract

   Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an
   architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize
   information exchange between the control plane and the forwarding
   plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES NE).  RFC3654 has defined
   the ForCES requirements, and RFC3746 has defined the ForCES
   framework.

   This document is an implementation report of the ForCES Protocol,
   Model and SCTP-TML, including the report on interoperability testing
   and the current state of ForCES implementations.

Internet-Draft      Implementation Report for ForCES      September 2009


1.  Terminology and Conventions

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Definitions

   This document follows the terminology defined by the ForCES
   Requirements in [RFC3654] and by the ForCES framework in [RFC3746].
   The definitions below are repeated below for clarity.

      Control Element (CE) - A logical entity that implements the ForCES
      protocol and uses it to instruct one or more FEs on how to process
      packets.  CEs handle functionality such as the execution of
      control and signaling protocols.

      Forwarding Element (FE) - A logical entity that implements the
      ForCES protocol.  FEs use the underlying hardware to provide per-
      packet processing and handling as directed/controlled by one or
      more CEs via the ForCES protocol.

      LFB (Logical Function Block) - The basic building block that is
      operated on by the ForCES protocol.  The LFB is a well defined,
      logically separable functional block that resides in an FE and is
      controlled by the CE via ForCES protocol.  The LFB may reside at
      the FE's datapath and process packets or may be purely an FE
      control or configuration entity that is operated on by the CE.
      Note that the LFB is a functionally accurate abstraction of the
      FE's processing capabilities, but not a hardware-accurate
      representation of the FE implementation.

      LFB Class and LFB Instance - LFBs are categorized by LFB Classes.
      An LFB Instance represents an LFB Class (or Type) existence.
      There may be multiple instances of the same LFB Class (or Type) in
      an FE.  An LFB Class is represented by an LFB Class ID, and an LFB
      Instance is represented by an LFB Instance ID.  As a result, an
      LFB Class ID associated with an LFB Instance ID uniquely specifies
      an LFB existence.

      LFB Metadata - Metadata is used to communicate per-packet state
      from one LFB to another, but is not sent across the network.  The
      FE model defines how such metadata is identified, produced and
      consumed by the LFBs.  It defines the functionality but not how
      metadata is encoded within an implementation.

Internet-Draft      Implementation Report for ForCES      September 2009


      LFB Components - Operational parameters of the LFBs that must be
      visible to the CEs are conceptualized in the FE model as the LFB
      components.  The LFB components include, for example, flags,
      single parameter arguments, complex arguments, and tables that the
      CE can read and/or Components write via the ForCES protocol (see
      below).

      ForCES Protocol - While there may be multiple protocols used
      within the overall ForCES architecture, the term "ForCES protocol"
      and "protocol" refer to the Fp reference points in the ForCES
      Framework in [RFC3746].  This protocol does not apply to CE-to-CE
      communication, FE-to-FE communication, or to communication between
      FE and CE managers.  Basically, the ForCES protocol works in a
      master- slave mode in which FEs are slaves and CEs are masters.
      This document defines the specifications for this ForCES protocol.

      ForCES Protocol Transport Mapping Layer (ForCES TML) - A layer in
      ForCES protocol architecture that uses the capabilities of
      existing transport protocols to specifically address protocol
      message transportation issues, such as how the protocol messages
      are mapped to different transport media (like TCP, IP, ATM,
      Ethernet, etc), and how to achieve and implement reliability,
      multicast, ordering, etc.  The ForCES TML specifications are
      detailed in separate ForCES documents, one for each TML.

2.  Introduction

   This is an implementation report for the ForCES protocol, model and
   SCTP-TML documents and includes an interoperability report.

   It follows the outline suggested by [I-D.dusseault-impl-reports].

   Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an
   architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize
   information exchange between the control plane and the forwarding
   plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES NE).  [RFC3654] has defined
   the ForCES requirements, and [RFC3746] has defined the ForCES
   framework.

2.1.  ForCES Protocol

   The ForCES protocol works in a master-slave mode in which FEs are
   slaves and CEs are masters.  The protocol includes commands for
   transport of Logical Function Block (LFB) configuration information,
   association setup, status, and event notifications, etc.  The reader
   is encouraged to read FE-protocol [I-D.ietf-forces-protocol] for
   further information.

2.2.  ForCES Model

   The FE-MODEL [I-D.ietf-forces-model] presents a formal way to define
   FE Logical Function Blocks (LFBs) using XML.  LFB configuration
   components, capabilities, and associated events are defined when the
   LFB is formally created.  The LFBs within the FE are accordingly
   controlled in a standardized way by the ForCES protocol.

2.3.  Transport mapping layer

   The TML transports the PL messages.  The TML is where the issues of
   how to achieve transport level reliability, congestion control,
   multicast, ordering, etc. are handled.  All ForCES Protocol Layer
   implementations MUST be portable across all TMLs.  Although more than
   one TML may be standardized for the ForCES Protocol, all
   implementations MUST IMPLEMENT the SCTP TML
   [I-D.ietf-forces-sctptml].

3.  Summary

   The authors attest that the ForCES Protocol, Model and SCTP-TML meet
   the requirements for Draft Standard.

   Three independent implementations were surveyed and found to already
   implement all the major features.  All implementors mentioned they
   will be implementing all missing features in the future.

   An interop test was conducted in July/2009 for all three
   implementations.  Two other organizations, which independently
   extended two different well known public domain protocol analyzers,
   also participated in the interop for a total of five independent
   organizations implementing.  The two protocol analyzers were used to
   verify validity of ForCEs protocol messages (and in some cases
   semantics).

   There were no notable difficulty in the interoperability test and
   almost all issues were code bugs that were dealt with mostly on site
   and tests repeated successfully.

4.  Methodology

   This report has both an implementation experience survey as well as
   the results of the interoperability test.

   The survey information was gathered after implementors answered a
   brief questionnaire with all ForCES Protocol, Model and SCTP-TML
   features.  The results can be seen in Section 6.1

   The interoperability results were part of the interoperability test.
   Extended Ethereal and extended Tcpdump were used to verify the
   results.  The results can be seen in Section 6.2

Internet-Draft      Implementation Report for ForCES      September 2009


5.  Exceptions

   The core features of the ForCES Protocol, Model and SCTP-TML have
   been implemented and tested in an interop in July, 2009.  The
   intention of the interop testing was to validate that all the main
   features of the 3 core documents were inter-operable amongst
   different implementations.  The tested features can be seen in
   Section 6.2.2.

   Different organizations surveyed have implemented certain features
   but not others.  This approach is driven by presence of different
   LFBs the different organizations have currently implemented.  All
   organizations surveyed have indicated intention to implement all
   outstanding features in due time.  The implemented features can be
   seen in Section 6.1.

   Regarding the security feature of TML, IPSec, the fact that is not
   currently implemented does not affect the validity of this
   implementation report, since IPSec is a well-known and widely
   implemented protocol and does not affect the actual ForCES protocol
   and model in any way.

6.  Detail Section

6.1.  Implementation Experience

   Three different organizations have implemented the ForCES Protocol,
   Model and SCTP-TML and answered a questionnaire.  These are:

   o  NTT Japan.

   o  University of Patras.

   o  Zhejiang Gongshang University.

   Also, not actual implementations, but extensions on protocol
   analyzers capable of understanding ForCES protocol messages, also are
   considered part of an implementation as they can offer validation of
   exchanged protocol messages.  Two such extensions have been created:

   o  Extension to Ethereal/Wireshark [ethereal].

   o  Extension to Tcpdump [tcpdump].

   All implementors were asked regarding the ForCES features they have
   implemented.  For every item listed the respondents indicated whether
   they had implemented it, will implement it, or won't implement it at
   all.

6.2.  Interoperability Report

   The interoperability test was performed at the University of Patras,
   in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

   There were two options to participate in the interoperability test.

   1.  Locally at the University of Patras premises.

   2.  Remotely via internet.

   Implementations from NTT and University of Patras, were present
   locally at the premises, while the implementation from Zhejiang
   Gongshang University were connected remotely.

   The interoperability test, tested the basic functionality of the
   ForCES protocol, mainly message passing and handling.

   The following scenarios were tested.

6.2.1.  Scenarios

   Since the main goal of this interoperability test is to test the
   basic protocol functionality, the test parameters are limited.

   1.  In the Association Setup Message, all report messages will be
       ignored.

   2.  In the Association Setup Phase, the messages, FEO OperEnable
       Event (FE to CE), Config FEO Adminup (CE to FE) and FEO Config-
       Resp (FE to CE) will be ignored.  The CE will assume that the FE
       is enabled once the LFBSelectors has been queried.

   3.  Only FullDataTLVs are going to be used and not SparseData TLV's.

   4.  There will be no transaction operations.

   5.  Each message shall have only one LFBSelector TLV, one Operation
       TLV and one PathDataTLV per message when these are used.

6.2.1.1.  Scenario 1 - Pre-association Setup

   While the Pre-association setup is not in the ForCES current scope it
   is an essential step before CEs and FEs communicate.  As the first
   part in a successful CE-FE connection the participating CEs and FEs
   should be able to be configured.

   In the Pre-association Phase the following configuration items MUST
   be setup regarding the CEs:

   o  The CE ID.

   o  The FE IDs that will be connected to this CE

   o  The IP of the FEs that will connect

   o  The TML priority ports.

   In the Pre-association Phase the following configuration items MUST
   be setup regarding the FEs:

6.2.1.2.  Scenario 2 - TML priority channels connection

   For the current interoperability test, the SCTP will be used as TML.
   The TML connection with the associating element is needed for the
   scenario 2 to be successful.

   The SCTP-TML document [I-D.ietf-forces-sctptml] defines 3 priority
   channels, with specific ports:

   o  High priority - Port number: 6700

   o  Medium priority - Port number: 6701

   o  Lower priority - Port number: 6702

6.2.1.3.  Scenario 3 - Association Setup - Association Complete

   Once the Pre-association phase has been complete in the previous 2
   scenarios, CEs and FEs are ready to communicate using the ForCES
   protocol, and enter the Association Setup stage.  In this stage the
   FEs attempts to join the NE.  The following ForCES protocol messages
   will be exchanged for each CE-FE pair in the specified order:

   o  Association Setup Message (from FE to CE)

   o  Association Setup Response Message (from CE to FE)

   o  Query Message: FEO LFBSelectors(from CE to FE)

   o  Query Response: FEO LFBSelectors response (from FE to CE)

6.2.1.4.  Scenario 4 - CE query

   Once the Association Phase stage has been complete, the FEs and CEs
   will enter the Established stage.  In this stage the FE is
   continuously updated or queried.  The CE should query the FE a
   specific value from the FE Object LFB and from the FE Protocol LFB.
   An example from the FE Protocol LFB is the HeartBeat Timer (FEHI) and
   from the FE Object LFB is the State of the LFB (FEState)

   The following ForCES protocol messages will be exchanged:

   o  Query Message

   o  Query Response Message

6.2.1.5.  Scenario 5 - Heartbeat monitoring

   The Heartbeat (HB) Message is used for one ForCES element (FE or CE)
   to asynchronously notify one or more other ForCES elements in the
   same ForCES NE on its liveness.  The default configuration of the
   Heartbeat Policy of the FE is set to 0 which means, that the FE
   should not generate any Heartbeat messages. the CE is responsible for
   checking FE liveness by setting the PL header ACK flag of the message
   it sends to AlwaysACK.  In this Scenario the CE should send a
   Heartbeat message with the ACK flag set to AlwaysACK and the FE
   should respond.

   The following ForCES protocol messages will be exchanged:

   o  Heartbeat Message

6.2.1.6.  Scenario 6 - Simple Config Command

   A config message is sent by the CE to the FE to configure LFB
   components in the FE.  A simple config command easily visible and
   metered would be to change the Heartbeat configuration.  This will be
   done in two steps:

   1.  Change the FE Heartbeat Policy (FEHBPolicy) to value 1, to force
       the FE to send heartbeats.

   2.  After some heartbeats from the FE, the FE Heartbeat Interval
       (FEHI) will be changed.

   The following ForCES protocol messages will be exchanged:

   o  Config Message

   o  Config Response Message

6.2.1.7.  Scenario 7 - Association Teardown

   In the end, the association must be terminated.  There are two
   scenarios by which the association maybe terminated:

   1.  Normal tear down by exchanging Association Teardown Message

   2.  Irregular tear down by stopping heartbeats from a FE or a CE.

   3.  Irregular tear down by externally shutting down/rebooting a FE or
       a CE.

   All scenarios may be tested in the interoperability test.

               Message Handling at Low priority (6702) Port

6.2.3.  Interoperability Results

   All implementations were found to be interoperable with each other.

   All scenarios were tested successfully.

   The following issues were found and dealt with.

   1.   Some messages were sent to the wrong priority channels.  There
        was some ambiguities on the SCTP-TML document that have been
        corrected.

   2.   At some point, a CE sent a TearDown message to the FE.  The CE
        expected the FE to shut down the connection, and the FE waited
        the CE to shut down the connection and were caught in a
        deadlock.  This was a code bug and was fixed.

   3.   Sometimes the association setup message, only on the remote
        connection test, although sent, was not received by the other
        end and made impossible the association.  This was caused by
        network problems.

   4.   An implementation did not take into account that the padding in
        TLVs MUST NOT be included in the length of the TLV.  This was a
        code bug and was fixed.

   5.   EM Flag was set to reserved by a CE and was not ignored by the
        FE.  This was a code bug and was fixed.

   6.   After the FEHBPolicy was set to 1 the FE didn't send any
        HeartBeats.  This was a code bug and was fixed.

   7.   Some FE's sent HeartBeats with the ACK flag with a value other
        than NoACK.  The CE responded.  This was a code bug and was
        fixed.

   8.   When a cable was disconnected, the TML didn't realize that.  The
        association was dropped due to heartbeats, this was a success,
        but this is an implementation issue implementers should keep in
        mind.  This is a SCTP options issue.  Nothing was needed to be

        done.

   9.   A CE crashed due to unknown LFBSelector values.  This was a code
        bug and was fixed.

   10.  With the remote connection there were a lot of ForCES packet
        retransmittion.  The problem is that packets like Heartbeats
        were retransmitted.  This is a SCTP issue.  SCTP-PR is needed to
        be used.

   The implementers went beyond the call of duty.  The test was extended
   with another test for batching messages.  This test was also done
   successfully.
