Internet-Draft     Floating-Point Textual Conventions      December 2010


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines textual conventions for the representation of
   floating-point numbers.  All of these definitions are in terms of the
   IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic, IEEE 754-2008
   [IEEE.754.2008].

   The IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic, IEEE 754-2008
   [IEEE.754.2008], provides for a variety of interchange formats for
   floating point numbers.  The need for three of these, namely

   o  32-bit,

   o  64-bit,

   o  128-bit,

   has been recognized in network management.  For example, Section
   4.2.3 of the SMIng Objectives [RFC3216] elaborates the need for these
   three floating-point data types in network management protocols.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This MIB module defines three textual conventions.  It defines no MIB
   objects.

3.1.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   This MIB module employs definitions from [RFC2578] and [RFC2579].

3.2.  Documents required for REFERENCE clauses

   This MIB module contains REFERENCE clauses making reference to IEEE
   754-2008 [IEEE.754.2008].

5.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions that may be used by other MIB
   modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  Therefore, this memo has no
   impact on the security of the Internet.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned

   OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:



      Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
      ----------        -----------------------
      floatTcMIB        { mib-2 XXX }


   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.
