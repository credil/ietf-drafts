    <abstract>
      <t>This document requests that an IPv4 /10 be reserved as Shared CGN
      Space solely to facilitate deployment of IPv4 Carrier Grade NAT (CGN)
      technologies after IPv4 exhaustion. This document updates RFC 1918 and
      RFC 5735 to reserve an additional special-use address range for use
      between a CGN and home router.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IPv4 address space is nearly exhausted. Until the Internet fully
      transitions to IPv6, Service Providers will be required to offer
      continued support for legacy IPv4-only devices. In order to facilitate
      the deployment of Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) technologies <xref
      target="RFC6264"></xref> to support such legacy IPv4-only devices and
      services, Service Providers require IPv4 address space that is separate
      from the range of IPv4 addresses used by subscribers. This address space
      need not be unique to each provider, but needs to be outside of <xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref> space. This document requests that an IPv4 /10
      be reserved as Shared CGN Space solely to facilitate deployment of CGN
      technologies in Service Provider networks. As Shared CGN Space is a new
      special-use address range between a CGN and home router, this document
      updates <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC5735"></xref> to reflect its use.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Motivation">
      <t>The Internet community is rapidly consuming the remaining supply of
      unallocated IPv4 addresses. During the transition period to IPv6, it is
      imperative that Service Providers maintain IPv4 service for devices and
      networks that are currently incapable of upgrading to IPv6. In order to
      provide IPv4 service to customers and/or devices once the IPv4 address
      space is exhausted, many Service Providers will need to multiplex
      several subscribers behind a single IPv4 address using a Carrier Grade
      NAT (CGN) <xref target="RFC6264"></xref>. Addresses between the CGN and
      subscriber home routers need not be globally unique, only unique inside
      the CGN. Thus, providers need sufficient non-<xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref> address space to deploy such technologies and
      avoid overlap with customer use of private address space.</t>

      <t>Additional applicability and analysis of Shared CGN Space is
      described in <xref
      target="I-D.bdgks-arin-shared-transition-space"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Shared CGN Space">
      <t>This document proposes the assignment of a /10 as Shared CGN Space.
      Shared CGN Space is IPv4 address space reserved for Service Provider use
      with the purpose of facilitating CGN deployment. The requested block
      MUST NOT be utilized for any purpose other than as "inside" addresses in
      a CGN environment (e.g., between the CGN and customer premises equipment
      (CPE)). Network equipment manufacturers MUST NOT use the assigned block
      in default or example device configurations.</t>

      <t>Because Shared CGN Space addresses have no meaning outside of the
      Service Provider, routing information about Shared CGN Space networks
      MUST NOT be propagated on interdomain links, and packets with Shared CGN
      Space source or destination addresses MUST NOT be forwarded across such
      links, except where required based on business relationships such as
      hosted CGN service. Service Providers SHOULD filter out routing
      information about Shared CGN Space networks on ingress links. DNS
      queries for Shared CGN Space addresses MUST NOT be forwarded to the
      global DNS infrastructure. This is done to avoid having to set up
      something similar to AS112.net for RFC 1918 private address space that a
      host has incorrectly sent for a DNS reverse-mapping queries on the
      public Internet <xref target="RFC6304"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Shared CGN Space is expected to be used in a Service Provider
      Environment. Shared CGN Space MUST NOT be used in network environments
      described in <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> as designed for private
      addresses - namely, for hosts that do not require access to hosts in
      other enterprises or the Internet at large, or hosts that need access to
      a limited set of outside services (e.g., E-mail, FTP, netnews, remote
      login) that can be handled by mediating gateways (e.g., application
      layer gateways). Shared CGN Space MUST NOT be used inside a home router
      NAT. With the exception of subscribers using bridged Internet access
      (i.e., without a home router between the subscriber and Service Provider
      networks), subscriber hosts SHOULD NOT use Shared CGN Space addresses.
      Because CGN service requires non-overlapping address space on each side
      of the home NAT and CGN, entities misusing Shared CGN Space for purposes
      other than for CGN service, as described in this document, are likely to
      experience problems implementing or connecting to CGN service at such
      time as they exhaust their supply of public IPv4 addresses.</t>

      <section anchor="absd" title="Address-Based Scope Detection">
        <t>Some CPE router devices make assumptions about their connectivity
        scope based on their WAN-side IPv4 address. This is particularly
        evident in their handling of 6to4 <xref target="RFC3056"></xref>,
        <xref target="RFC3068"></xref>. As described in <xref
        target="RFC6343"></xref>, CPE routers do not attempt to initialize
        6to4 tunnels when they are configured with a <xref
        target="RFC1918"></xref> or <xref target="RFC5735"></xref> WAN
        address. When configured with a Shared CGN Space address (or other
        address range not described in <xref target="RFC5735"></xref>), such
        devices may attempt to initiate 6to4. Since 6to4 includes the WAN IPv4
        address embedded in its IPv6 address, should 6to4 traffic traverse a
        CGN, return traffic could be misdirected and not reach the originating
        router. Service Providers can mitigate this issue using a technology
        such as 6to4-PMT <xref
        target="I-D.kuarsingh-v6ops-6to4-provider-managed-tunnel"></xref>.
        When the address range is well-defined, as with Shared CGN Space, home
        router vendors can include Shared CGN Space in their list of
        special-use addresses (e.g., <xref target="RFC5735"></xref>) and treat
        Shared CGN Space similarly to private <xref target="RFC1918"></xref>
        space. When the WAN address is not well-defined, as in the case of
        Globally Unique space, it will be more difficult for home router
        vendors to mitigate against this issue. </t>

        <t>CGN technologies impose additional impacts on applications (see
        <xref target="RFC6269"></xref> and <xref
        target="I-D.donley-nat444-impacts"></xref>) that are not dependent on
        the address space between the CGN and home router.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Alternatives">
      <t>As described in <xref target="RFC6319"></xref>, there are two
      alternatives to Shared CGN Space, considered below:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Use private <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> address space.</t>

          <t>Use Globally-Unique address space.</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="RFC1918 Space">
        <t>In some cases, it may be possible to instead use private <xref
        target="RFC1918"></xref> address space between the CGN and CPE
        devices. In situations where all endpoints in the network are managed
        by the service provider (including customer LAN addressing), this may
        be a viable option. However, when customers administer their own LANs
        or use default addresses assigned to CPE devices, the possibility of
        address conflict becomes a significant risk to operations. Private
        <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> address space is not generally intended
        to be used for purposes which cross administrative domains. Further,
        CGN service requires address space in one administrative domain that
        extends to leaf networks that are generally single-homed to the
        serving administrative domain. This usage is outside of Category 1 and
        Category 2, defined in <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> for use of
        private address space.</t>

        <t>A study of DNS traffic <xref target="v6ops-msg06187"></xref> has
        shown that effectively all of the existing private <xref
        target="RFC1918"></xref> address space is currently being used by
        end-sites attached to the Internet. While individual network
        environments may vary in this regard, most Service Providers face the
        risk that their use of private address space will conflict with their
        customer end-sites.</t>

        <t>In the event of conflict, it is possible that the end-site CPE
        routers will fail and/or not function correctly. While some CPE
        implementations will support overlapping addresses on the "inside" and
        "outside" interfaces, others are known to fail under such
        circumstances. Also, the use of private <xref target="RFC1918"></xref>
        address space on interfaces and hosts often causes default behaviors
        on such hosts which may not be desirable when the endpoint is actually
        connected to the Internet. For instance, one common home router warns
        customers against enabling NAT when it detects private <xref
        target="RFC1918"></xref> addresses on its WAN interface, and instead
        encourages bridge mode. If NAT mode is enabled, the router turns the
        status light amber, indicating an error.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Globally Unique Space">
        <t>If Shared CGN Space is not available, the total aggregate demand
        for Globally-Unique space behind a CGN will be significantly higher
        than the /10 requested as Shared CGN Space. In addition to use of
        significant IPv4 addresses that could otherwise be offered to
        subscribers, as described in <xref
        target="I-D.bdgks-arin-shared-transition-space"></xref>, if various
        organizations use public address space to number CGN zones, it will be
        difficult for other networks/hosts to deterministically know if the
        endpoints are using Internet reachable addresses, or if they are
        leaking from behind a CGN, as described above (<xref
        target="absd"></xref>). This situation would likely lead to additional
        technical issues during various leakage conditions, make it difficult
        to identify filter rule issues, and pose challenges for Content
        Distribution Networks (CDNs) or other third party providers.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Similar to other <xref target="RFC5735"></xref> special use IPv4
      addresses, Shared CGN Space as described in this document does not
      directly raise security issues. However, the Internet does not
      inherently protect against abuse of these addresses. Unless required for
      legitimate business needs between directly-connected Service Providers,
      Service Providers SHOULD filter incoming router advertisements for
      Shared CGN Space. Attacks have been mounted that depend on the
      unexpected use of similar special-use addresses. However, it should also
      be noted that this address spaces may be used legitimately outside a
      single administrative domain. Thus, network operators are encouraged to
      review this document and determine what security policies should be
      associated with this address block within their specific operating
      environments. In many cases, Shared CGN Space will be appropriate to
      include in Ingress Filter lists <xref target="RFC3704"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is asked to record the allocation of an IPv4 /10 for use as
      Shared CGN Space.</t>

      <t>The Shared CGN Space address range is: x.x.0.0/10. [Note to RFC
      Editor: this address range to be added before publication]</t>
