1. Terminology 

   For description of the terminology used in this specification, please 
   see the Terminology ID referenced in Section 10.1. 

    

2. Introduction 

   Commercial buildings have been fitted with pneumatic and subsequently 
   electronic communication pathways connecting sensors to their 
   controllers for over one hundred years.  Recent economic and 
   technical advances in wireless communication allow facilities to 
   increasingly utilize a wireless solution in lieu of a wired solution; 
   thereby reducing installation costs while maintaining highly reliant 
   communication.   

   The cost benefits and ease of installation of wireless sensors allow 
   customers to further instrument their facilities with additional 
   sensors; providing tighter control while yielding increased energy 
   savings.   

   Wireless solutions will be adapted from their existing wired 
   counterparts in many of the building applications including, but not 
   limited to Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), 
   Lighting, Physical Security, Fire, and Elevator systems. These 
   devices will be developed to reduce installation costs; while 
   increasing installation and retrofit flexibility, as well as 
   increasing the sensing fidelity to improve efficiency and building 
   service quality.  

    

   Sensing devices may be battery or mains powered.  Actuators and area 
   controllers will be mains powered.

   Facility Management Systems (FMS) are deployed in a large set of 
   vertical markets including universities; hospitals; government 
   facilities; Kindergarten through High School (K-12); pharmaceutical 
   manufacturing facilities; and single-tenant or multi-tenant office 
   buildings. These buildings range in size from 100K sqft structures (5 
   story office buildings), to 1M sqft skyscrapers (100 story 
   skyscrapers) to complex government facilities such as the Pentagon.  
   The described topology is meant to be the model to be used in all 
   these types of environments, but clearly must be tailored to the 
   building class, building tenant and vertical market being served.   

   The following sections describe the sensor, actuator, area controller 
   and zone controller layers of the topology.  (NOTE: The Building 
   Controller and Enterprise layers of the FMS are excluded from this 
   discussion since they typically deal in communication rates requiring 
   WLAN communication technologies).   

    

2.1. Facility Management System (FMS) Topology 

 2.1.1. Introduction 

   To understand the network systems requirements of a facility 
   management system in a commercial building, this document uses a 
   framework to describe the basic functions and composition of the 
   system. An FMS is a hierarchical system of sensors, actuators, 
   controllers and user interface devices based on spatial extent.  
   Additionally, an FMS may also be divided functionally across alike, 
   but different building subsystems such as HVAC, Fire, Security, 
   Lighting, Shutters and Elevator control systems as denoted in Figure 
   1. 

   Much of the makeup of an FMS is optional and installed at the behest 
   of the customer.  Sensors and actuators have no standalone 
   functionality. All other devices support partial or complete 
   standalone functionality.  These devices can optionally be tethered 
   to form a more cohesive system.  The customer requirements dictate 
   the level of integration within the facility.  This architecture 
   provides excellent fault tolerance since each node is designed to 
   operate in an independent mode if the higher layers are unavailable.

 2.1.2. Sensors/Actuators 

   As Figure 1 indicates an FMS may be composed of many functional 
   stacks or silos that are interoperably woven together via Building 
   Applications.  Each silo has an array of sensors that monitor the 
   environment and actuators that effect the environment as determined 
   by the upper layers of the FMS topology.   The sensors typically are 
   the fringe of the network structure providing environmental data into 
   the system.  The actuators are the sensors counterparts modifying the 
   characteristics of the system based on the input sensor data and the 
   applications deployed.   

 2.1.3. Area Controllers 

   An area describes a small physical locale within a building, 
   typically a room.  HVAC (temperature and humidity) and Lighting (room 
   lighting, shades, solar loads) vendors oft times deploy area 
   controllers. Area controls are fed by sensor inputs that monitor the 
   environmental conditions within the room.  Common sensors found in 
   many rooms that feed the area controllers include temperature, 
   occupancy, lighting load, solar load and relative humidity.  Sensors

   found in specialized rooms (such as chemistry labs) might include air 
   flow, pressure, CO2 and CO particle sensors.  Room actuation includes 
   temperature setpoint, lights and blinds/curtains. 

 2.1.4. Zone Controllers 

   Zone Control supports a similar set of characteristics as the Area 
   Control albeit to an extended space.  A zone is normally a logical 
   grouping or functional division of a commercial building.  A zone may 
   also coincidentally map to a physical locale such as a floor. 

   Zone Control may have direct sensor inputs (smoke detectors for 
   fire), controller inputs (room controllers for air-handlers in HVAC) 
   or both (door controllers and tamper sensors for security).  Like 
   area/room controllers, zone controllers are standalone devices that 
   operate independently or may be attached to the larger network for 
   more synergistic control. 

    

2.2. Installation Methods 

 2.2.1. Wired Communication Media 

   Commercial controllers are traditionally deployed in a facility using 
   twisted pair serial media following the EIA-485 electrical standard 
   operating nominally at 38400 to 76800 baud.  This allows runs to 5000 
   ft without a repeater.  With the maximum of three repeaters, a single 
   communication trunk can serpentine 15000 ft.  EIA-485 is a multi-drop 
   media allowing upwards to 255 devices to be connected to a single 
   trunk. 

    Most sensors and virtually all actuators currently used in 
   commercial buildings are "dumb", non-communicating hardwired devices.  
   However, sensor buses are beginning to be deployed by vendors which 
   are used for smart sensors and point multiplexing.   The Fire 
   industry deploys addressable fire devices, which usually use some 
   form of proprietary communication wiring driven by fire codes.  

 2.2.2. Device Density 

   Device density differs depending on the application and as dictated 
   by the local building code requirements.  The following sections 
   detail typical installation densities for different applications.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs     January 2009 
    

2.2.2.1. HVAC Device Density 

   HVAC room applications typically have sensors/actuators and 
   controllers spaced about 50ft apart.  In most cases there is a 3:1 
   ratio of sensors/actuators to controllers.  That is, for each room 
   there is an installed temperature sensor, flow sensor and damper 
   actuator for the associated room controller.  

   HVAC equipment room applications are quite different.  An air handler 
   system may have a single controller with upwards to 25 sensors and 
   actuators within 50 ft of the air handler.  A chiller or boiler is 
   also controlled with a single equipment controller instrumented with 
   25 sensors and actuators.  Each of these devices would be 
   individually addressed since the devices are mandated or optional as 
   defined by the specified HVAC application.  Air handlers typically 
   serve one or two floors of the building.  Chillers and boilers may be 
   installed per floor, but many times service a wing, building or the 
   entire complex via a central plant. 

   These numbers are typical.  In special cases, such as clean rooms, 
   operating rooms, pharmaceuticals and labs, the ratio of sensors to 
   controllers can increase by a factor of three.  Tenant installations 
   such as malls would opt for packaged units where much of the sensing 
   and actuation is integrated into the unit.  Here a single device 
   address would serve the entire unit. 

2.2.2.2. Fire Device Density 

   Fire systems are much more uniformly installed with smoke detectors 
   installed about every 50 feet.  This is dictated by local building 
   codes.  Fire pull boxes are installed uniformly about every 150 feet.  
   A fire controller will service a floor or wing.  The fireman's fire 
   panel will service the entire building and typically is installed in 
   the atrium. 

2.2.2.3. Lighting Device Density 

   Lighting is also very uniformly installed with ballasts installed 
   approximately every 10 feet.  A lighting panel typically serves 48 to 
   64 zones.  Wired systems typically tether many lights together into a 
   single zone.  Wireless systems configure each fixture independently 
   to increase flexibility and reduce installation costs. 

2.2.2.4. Physical Security Device Density 

   Security systems are non-uniformly oriented with heavy density near 
   doors and windows and lighter density in the building interior space.

   The recent influx of interior and perimeter camera systems is 
   increasing the security footprint.  These cameras are atypical 
   endpoints requiring upwards to 1 megabit/second (Mbit/s) data rates 
   per camera as contrasted by the few Kbits/s needed by most other FMS 
   sensing equipment.  Previously, camera systems had been deployed on 
   proprietary wired high speed network. More recent implementations 
   utilize wired or wireless IP cameras integrated to the enterprise 
   LAN.   

2.2.3. Installation Procedure 

   Wired FMS installation is a multifaceted procedure depending on the 
   extent of the system and the software interoperability requirement.  
   However, at the sensor/actuator and controller level, the procedure 
   is typically a two or three step process. 

   Most FMS equipment is 24 VAC equipment that can be installed by a 
   low-voltage electrician.  He/she arrives on-site during the 
   construction of the building prior to the sheet wall and ceiling 
   installation.  This allows him/her to allocate wall space, easily 
   land the equipment and run the wired controller and sensor networks.  
   The Building Controllers and Enterprise network are not normally 
   installed until months later.  The electrician completes his task by 
   running a wire verification procedure that shows proper continuity 
   between the devices and proper local operation of the devices.   

   Later in the installation cycle, the higher order controllers are 
   installed, programmed and commissioned together with the previously 
   installed sensors, actuators and controllers.  In most cases the IP 
   network is still not operable.  The Building Controllers are 
   completely commissioned using a crossover cable or a temporary IP 
   switch together with static IP addresses. 

   Once the IP network is operational, the FMS may optionally be added 
   to the enterprise network.  The wireless installation process must 
   follow the same work flow.  The electrician will install the products 
   as before and run local functional tests between the wireless device 
   to assure operation before leaving the job.   The electrician does 
   not carry a laptop so the commissioning must be built into the device 
   operation.

3. Building Automation Applications 

   Vooruit is an arts centre in a restored monument which dates from 
   1913.  This complex monument consists of over 350 different rooms 
   including a meeting rooms, large public halls and theaters serving as 
   many as 2500 guests.  A number of use cases regarding Vooruit are 
   described in the following text.  The situations and needs described 
   in these use cases can also be found in all automated large 
   buildings, such as airports and hospitals. 

3.1. Locking and Unlocking the Building 

   The member of the cleaning staff arrives first in the morning 
   unlocking the building (or a part of it) from the control room.  This 
   means that several doors are unlocked; the alarms are switched off; 
   the heating turns on; some lights switch on, etc.  Similarly, the 
   last person leaving the building has to lock the building.  This will 
   lock all the outer doors, turn the alarms on, switch off heating and 
   lights, etc. 

   The ''building locked'' or ''building unlocked'' event needs to be 
   delivered to a subset of all the sensors and actuators. It can be 
   beneficial if those field devices form a group (e.g. ''all-sensors-
   actuators-interested-in-lock/unlock-events). Alternatively, the area 
   and zone controllers could form a group where the arrival of such an 
   event results in each area and zone controller initiating unicast or 
   multicast within the LLN. 

   This use case is also described in the home automation, although the 
   requirement about preventing the "popcorn effect" draft [I-D.ietf-
   roll-home-routing-reqs] can be relaxed a little bit in building 
   automation. It would be nice if lights, roll-down shutters and other 
   actuators in the same room or area with transparent walls execute the 
   command around (not 'at') the same time (a tolerance of 200 ms is 
   allowed). 

3.2. Building Energy Conservation 

   A room that is not in use should not be heated, air conditioned or 
   ventilated and the lighting should be turned off.  In a building with 
   a lot of rooms it can happen quite frequently that someone forgets to 
   switch off the HVAC and lighting.  This is a real waste of valuable

   energy.  To prevent this from happening, the janitor can program the 
   building according to the day's schedule.  This way lighting and HVAC 
   is turned on prior to the use of a room, and turned off afterwards.  
   Using such a system Vooruit has realized a saving of 35% on the gas 
   and electricity bills.   

3.3. Inventory and Remote Diagnosis of Safety Equipment 

   Each month Vooruit is obliged to make an inventory of its safety 
   equipment.  This task takes two working days.  Each fire extinguisher 
   (100), fire blanket (10), fire-resistant door (120) and evacuation 
   plan (80) must be checked for presence and proper operation.  Also 
   the battery and lamp of every safety lamp must be checked before each 
   public event (safety laws).  Automating this process using asset 
   tracking and low-power wireless technologies would reduce a heavy 
   burden on working hours. 

   It is important that these messages are delivered very reliably and 
   that the power consumption of the sensors/actuators attached to this 
   safety equipment is kept at a very low level.  

    

3.4. Life Cycle of Field Devices 

   Some field devices (e.g. smoke detectors) are replaced periodically.   
   The ease by which devices are added and deleted from the network is 
   very important to support augmenting sensors/actuators during 
   construction. 

   A secure mechanism is needed to remove the old device and install the 
   new device.  New devices need to be authenticated before they can 
   participate in the routing process of the LLN. After the 
   authentication, zero-configuration of the routing protocol is 
   necessary. 

3.5. Surveillance 

   Ingress and egress are real-time applications needing response times 
   below 500msec, for example for cardkey authorization.  It must be 
   possible to configure doors individually to restrict use on a per 
   person basis with respect to time-of-day and person entering.  While 
   much of the surveillance application involves sensing and actuation 
   at the door and communication with the centralized security system, 
   other aspects, including tamper, door ajar, and forced entry 
   notification, are to be delivered to one or more fixed or mobile user 
   devices within 5 seconds.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs     January 2009 
    

3.6. Emergency 

   In case of an emergency it is very important that all the visitors be 
   evacuated as quickly as possible.  The fire and smoke detectors set 
   off an alarm and alert the mobile personnel on their user device 
   (e.g. PDA).  All emergency exits are instantly unlocked and the 
   emergency lighting guides the visitors to these exits.  The necessary 
   sprinklers are activated and the electricity grid monitored if it 
   becomes necessary to shut down some parts of the building. Emergency 
   services are notified instantly.   

   A wireless system could bring in some extra safety features.  
   Locating fire fighters and guiding them through the building could be 
   a life-saving application. 

   These life critical applications ought to take precedence over other 
   network traffic.  Commands entered during these emergencies have to 
   be properly authenticated by device, user, and command request. 

    

3.7. Public Address 

   It should be possible to send audio and text messages to the visitors 
   in the building.  These messages can be very diverse, e.g. ASCII text 
   boards displaying the name of the event in a room, audio 
   announcements such as delays in the program, lost and found children, 
   evacuation orders, etc. 

   The control network is expected be able to readily sense the presence 
   of an audience in an area and deliver applicable message content. 

    

    

4. Building Automation Routing Requirements  

   Following are the building automation routing requirements for a 
   network used to integrate building sensor actuator and control 
   products.  These requirements have been limited to routing 
   requirements only.  These requirements are written not presuming any 
   preordained network topology, physical media (wired) or radio 
   technology (wireless).  See Appendix A for additional requirements 
   that have been deemed outside the scope of this document yet will 
   pertain to the successful deployment of building automation systems.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs     January 2009 
    

    

4.1. Installation 

   Building control systems typically are installed and tested by 
   electricians having little computer knowledge and no network 
   knowledge whatsoever.  These systems are often installed during the 
   building construction phase before the drywall and ceilings are in 
   place.  For new construction projects, the building enterprise IP 
   network is not in place during installation of the building control 
   system. 

   In retrofit applications, pulling wires from sensors to controllers 
   can be costly and in some applications (e.g. museums) not feasible. 

   Local (ad hoc) testing of sensors and room controllers must be 
   completed before the tradesperson can complete his/her work.  This 
   testing allows the tradesperson to verify correct client (e.g. light 
   switch) and server (e.g. light ballast) before leaving the jobsite.   
   In traditional wired systems correct operation of a light 
   switch/ballast pair was as simple as flipping on the light switch.  
   In wireless applications, the tradesperson has to assure the same 
   operation, yet be sure the operation of the light switch is 
   associated to the proper ballast.  

   System level commissioning will later be deployed using a more 
   computer savvy person with access to a commissioning device (e.g. a 
   laptop   computer).  The completely installed and commissioned 
   enterprise IP network may or may not be in place at this time.  
   Following are the installation routing requirements. 

 4.1.1. Zero-Configuration installation 

   It MUST be possible to fully commission network devices without 
   requiring any additional commissioning device (e.g. laptop). The 
   device MAY support up to sixteen integrated switches to uniquely 
   identify the device on the network. 

 4.1.2. Sleeping devices 

   Sensing devices will, in cases, utilize battery power or energy 
   harvesting techniques for power and will operate in a mostly sleeping 
   mode to maintain power consumption within a modest budget.  Routing 
   MUST recognize the constraints associated the power budget of such 
   low duty cycle devices.  If such devices provide routing, rather than 
   merely host connectivity, the energy costs associated with such 
   routing need to fit within the power budget.  If the mechanisms for 
 
 
Martocci,(et al)        Expires July 14, 2009                 [Page 13] 

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs     January 2009 
    

   duty cycling dictate very long response times or specific temporal 
   scheduling, routing and forwarding will need to take such constraints 
   into account. 

   Communication to these mostly sleeping devices MUST be bidirectional.  
   Typically, batteries need to be operational for at least 5 years when 
   the sensing device is transmitting its data(e.g. 64 bytes) once per 
   minute.  This requires that sleeping devices must have minimal link 
   on time when they awake and transmit onto the network. Moreover, 
   maintaining the ability to receive inbound data must be accomplished 
   with minimal link on time. 

   In many cases, proxies with unconstrained power budgets are used to 
   cache the inbound data for a sleeping device until the device 
   awakens.  In such cases, routing MUST recognize the selected proxy 
   for the sleeping device. 

    

 4.1.3. Local Testing 

   The local sensors and requisite actuators and controllers must be 
   testable within the locale (e.g. room) to assure communication 
   connectivity and local operation without requiring other systemic 
   devices.  Routing must allow for temporary ad hoc paths to be 
   established that are updated as the network physically and 
   functionally expands. 

 4.1.4. Device Replacement 

   Replacement devices need to be plug-and-play with no additional setup 
   compared to what is normally required for a new device.  Devices 
   referencing data in the replaced device must be able to reference 
   data in its replacement without being reconfigured to refer to the 
   new device.  Thus, such a reference cannot be a hardware identifier, 
   such as the MAC address, nor a hardcoded route.  If such a reference 
   is an IP address, the replacement device must be assigned the IP 
   addressed previously bound to the replaced device.  Or if the logical 
   equivalent of a hostname is used for the reference, it must be 
   translated to the replacement IP address.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs     January 2009 
    

4.2. Scalability 

   Building control systems are designed for facilities from 50000 sq. 
   ft. to 1M+ sq. ft.  The networks that support these systems must 
   cost-effectively scale accordingly.  In larger facilities 
   installation may occur simultaneously on various wings or floors, yet 
   the end system must seamlessly merge.  Following are the scalability 
   requirements. 

 4.2.1. Network Domain 

   The routing protocol MUST be able to support networks with at least 
   1000 routers and 1000 hosts.  Subnetworks (e.g. rooms, primary 
   equipment) within the network must support upwards to 255 sensors 
   and/or actuators. 

   . 

 4.2.2. Peer-to-peer Communication 

   The data domain for commercial FMS systems may sprawl across a vast 
   portion of the physical domain.  For example, a chiller may reside in 
   the facility's basement due to its size, yet the associated cooling 
   towers will reside on the roof.  The cold-water supply and return 
   pipes serpentine through all the intervening floors.  The feedback 
   control loops for these systems require data from across the 
   facility. 

   A network device must be able to communicate in a peer-to-peer manner 
   with any other device on the network. Thus, the routing protocol MUST 
   provide routes between arbitrary hosts within the appropriate 
   administrative domain.  

    

4.3. Mobility 

   Most devices are affixed to walls or installed on ceilings within 
   buildings.  Hence the mobility requirements for commercial buildings 
   are few.  However, in wireless environments location tracking of 
   occupants and assets is gaining favor.   

 4.3.1. Mobile Device Association 

   Mobile devices SHOULD be capable of unjoining (handing-off) from an 
   old network joining onto a new network within 15 seconds.

4.4. Resource Constrained Devices 

   Sensing and actuator device processing power and memory may be 4 
   orders of magnitude less (i.e. 10,000x) than many more traditional 
   client devices on an IP network.  The routing mechanisms MUST 
   therefore be tailored to fit these resource constrained devices.  

 4.4.1. Limited Processing Power Sensors/Actuators 

   The software stack requirements for sensors and actuators MUST be 
   implementable in 8-bit devices with no more than 128KB of flash 
   memory (including at least 32KB for the application code) and no more 
   than 8KB of RAM (including at least 1KB RAM available for the 
   application). 

 4.4.2. Limited Processing Power Controllers 

   The software stack requirements for room controllers SHOULD be 
   implementable in 8-bit devices with no more than 256KB of flash 
   memory (including at least 32KB for the application code) and no more 
   than 8KB of RAM (including at least 1KB RAM available for the 
   application) 

    

4.5. Addressing 

   Facility Management systems require different communication schema to 
   solicit or post network information. Broadcasts or anycasts need be 
   used to resolve unresolved references within a device when the device 
   first joins the network.   

   As with any network communication, broadcasting should be minimized.  
   This is especially a problem for small embedded devices with limited 
   network bandwidth.  In many cases a global broadcast could be 
   replaced with a multicast since the application knows the application 
   domain.  Broadcasts and multicasts are typically used for network 
   joins and application binding in embedded systems. 

 4.5.1. Unicast/Multicast/Anycast 

   Routing MUST support anycast, unicast, multicast and broadcast 
   services (or IPv6 equivalent).

4.6. Manageability 

   In addition to the initial installation of the system (see Section 
   4.1), it is equally important for the ongoing maintenance of the 
   system to be simple and inexpensive. 

 4.6.1. Firmware Upgrades 

   To support high speed code downloads, routing MUST support transports 
   that provide parallel downloads to targeted devices yet guarantee 
   packet delivery. 

 4.6.2. Diagnostics 

   To improve diagnostics, the network layer SHOULD be able to be placed 
   in and out of 'verbose' mode.  Verbose mode is a temporary debugging 
   mode that provides additional communication information including at 
   least total number of packets sent, packets received, number of 
   failed communication attempts, neighbor table and routing table 
   entries. 

 4.6.3. Route Tracking 

   Route diagnostics SHOULD be supported providing information such as 
   path quality; number of hops; available alternate active paths with 
   associated costs. 

    

4.7. Compatibility 

   The building automation industry adheres to application layer 
   protocol standards to achieve vendor interoperability.  These 
   standards are BACnet and LON.  It is estimated that fully 80% of the 
   customer bid requests received world-wide will require compliance to  
   one or both of these standards.  ROLL routing will therefore need to 
   dovetail to these application protocols to assure acceptance in the 
   building automation industry.  These protocols have been in place for 
   over 10 years.  Many sites will require backwards compatibility with 
   the existing legacy devices.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs     January 2009 
    

 4.7.1. IPv4 Compatibility 

   The routing protocol MUST support intercommunication among IPv4 and 
   IPv6 devices.. 

 4.7.2. Maximum Packet Size 

   Routing MUST support packet sizes to 1526 octets (to be backwards 
   compatible with 802.3 subnetworks) 

    

4.8. Route Selection 

   Route selection determines reliability and quality of the 
   communication paths among the devices. Optimizing the routes over 
   time resolve any nuances developed at system startup when nodes are 
   asynchronously adding themselves to the network.  Path adaptation 
   will reduce latency if the path costs consider hop count as a cost 
   attribute. 

 4.8.1. Path Cost 

   The routing protocol MUST support a metric of route quality and 
   optimize path selection according to such metrics within constraints 
   established for links along the paths. These metrics SHOULD reflect 
   metrics such as signal strength, available bandwidth, hop count, 
   energy availability and communication error rates. 

 4.8.2. Path Adaptation 

   Communication paths MUST adapt toward the chosen metric(s) (e.g. 
   signal quality) optimality in time. 

 4.8.3. Route Redundancy 

   The network layer SHOULD be configurable to allow secondary and 
   tertiary paths to be established and used upon failure of the primary 
   path.   

 4.8.4. Route Discovery Time 

   Mission critical commercial applications (e.g. Fire,Security) require 
   reliable communication and guaranteed end-to-end delivery of all 
   messages in a timely fashion.  Application layer time-outs must be 
   selected judiciously to cover anomalous conditions such as lost 
   packets and/or path discoveries; yet not be set too large to over 
 
 
Martocci,(et al)        Expires July 14, 2009                 [Page 18] 

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs     January 2009 
    

   damp the network response.  Route discovery occurring during packet 
   transmission MUST not exceed 120 msecs. 

 4.8.5. Route Preference 

   The route discovery mechanism SHOULD allow a source node (sensor) to 
   dictate a configured destination node (controller) as a preferred 
   routing path. 

 4.8.6. Path Persistence 

   To eliminate high network traffic in power-fail or brown-out 
   conditions previously established routes SHOULD be remembered and 
   invoked prior to establishing new routes for those devices reentering 
   the network. 

 

5. Traffic Pattern 

   The independent nature of the automation systems within a building 
   plays heavy onto the network traffic patterns.  Much of the real-time 
   sensor data stays within the local environment.  Alarming and other 
   event data will percolate to higher layers.   

   Systemic data may be either polled or event based.  Polled data 
   systems will generate a uniform packet load on the network.  This 
   architecture has proven not scalable.  Most vendors have developed 
   event based systems which passes data on event.  These systems are 
   highly scalable and generate low data on the network at quiescence.  
   Unfortunately, the systems will generate a heavy load on startup 
   since all the initial data must migrate to the controller level.  
   They also will generate a temporary but heavy load during firmware 
   upgrades.  This latter load can normally be mitigated by performing 
   these downloads during off-peak hours. 

   Devices will need to reference peers occasionally for sensor data or 
   to coordinate across systems.  Normally, though, data will migrate 
   from the sensor level upwards through the local, area then 
   supervisory level.  Bottlenecks will typically form at the funnel 
   point from the area controllers to the supervisory controllers.

7. Security Considerations 

   Security policies, especially wireless encryption and overall device 
   authentication need to be considered.  These issues are out of scope 
   for the routing requirements, but could have an impact on the 
   processing capabilities of the sensors and controllers. 

   As noted above, the FMS systems are typically highly configurable in 
   the field and hence the security policy is most often dictated by the 
   type of building to which the FMS is being installed.

11. Appendix A: Additional Building Requirements 

   Appendix A contains additional building requirements that were deemed 
   out of scope for the routing document yet provided ancillary 
   informational substance to the reader.  The requirements will need to 
   be addressed by ROLL or other WGs before adoption by the building 
   automation industry will be considered. 

11.1. Additional Commercial Product Requirements 

11.1.1.  Wired and Wireless Implementations 

   Solutions must support both wired and wireless implementations. 

11.1.2. World-wide Applicability 

   Wireless devices must be supportable at the 2.4Ghz ISM band.  
   Wireless devices should be supportable at the 900 and 868 ISM bands 
   as well. 

11.1.3.  Support of the BACnet Building Protocol 

   Devices implementing the ROLL features should support the BACnet 
   protocol. 

11.1.4.  Support of the LON Building Protocol 

   Devices implementing the ROLL features should support the LON 
   protocol.

11.1.5.  Energy Harvested Sensors 

   RFDs should target for operation using viable energy harvesting 
   techniques such as ambient light, mechanical action, solar load, air 
   pressure and differential temperature. 

11.1.6.  Communication Distance 

   A source device may be upwards to 1000 feet from its destination.  
   Communication may need to be established between these devices 
   without needing to install other intermediate 'communication only' 
   devices such as repeaters 

11.1.7.  Automatic Gain Control 

   For wireless implementations, the device radios should incorporate 
   automatic transmit power regulation to maximize packet transfer and 
   minimize network interference regardless of network size or density. 

 11.1.8.   Cost 

   The total installed infrastructure cost including but not limited to 
   the media, required infrastructure devices (amortized across the 
   number of devices); labor to install and commission the network must 
   not exceed $1.00/foot for wired implementations.   

   Wireless implementations (total installed cost) must cost no more 
   than 80% of wired implementations. 

11.2.    Additional Installation and Commissioning Requirements  

 11.2.1.   Device Setup Time 

   Network setup by the installer must take no longer than 20 seconds 
   per device installed. 

11.2.2.  Unavailability of an IT network 

   Product commissioning must be performed by an application engineer 
   prior to the installation of the IT network.   

11.3.    Additional Network Requirements  

 11.3.1.   TCP/UDP 

   Connection based and connectionless services must be supported

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs     January 2009 
    

 11.3.2.   Data Rate Performance 

   An effective data rate of 20kbits/s is the lowest acceptable 
   operational data rate acceptable on the network. 

 11.3.3.   High Speed Downloads 

   Devices receiving a download MAY cease normal operation, but upon 
   completion of the download must automatically resume normal 
   operation. 

11.3.4.  Interference Mitigation 

   The network must automatically detect interference and seamlessly 
   migrate the network hosts channel to improve communication.  Channel 
   changes and nodes response to the channel change must occur within 60 
   seconds. 

11.3.5.  Real-time Performance Measures 

   A node transmitting a 'request with expected reply' to another node 
   must send the message to the destination and receive the response in 
   not more than 120 msec.  This response time should be achievable with 
   5 or less hops in each direction.  This requirement assumes network 
   quiescence and a negligible turnaround time at the destination node. 

 11.3.6.   Packet Reliability 

   Reliability must meet the following minimum criteria : 

   < 1% MAC layer errors on all messages; After no more than three 
   retries   

   < .1% Network layer errors on all messages; 

   After no more than three additional retries; 

   < 0.01% Application layer errors on all messages. 

   Therefore application layer messages will fail no more than once 
   every 100,000 messages. 

 11.3.7.   Merging Commissioned Islands 

   Subsystems are commissioned by various vendors at various times 
   during building construction.  These subnetworks must seamlessly

   merge into networks and networks must seamlessly merge into 
   internetworks since the end user wants a holistic view of the system. 

 11.3.8.   Adjustable System Table Sizes 

   Routing must support adjustable router table entry sizes on a per 
   node basis to maximize limited RAM in the devices. 

    

11.4. Prioritized Routing 

   Network and application routing prioritization is required to assure 
   that mission critical applications (e.g. Fire Detection) cannot be 
   deferred while less critical application access the network. 

11.4.1. Packet Prioritization 

   Routers must support quality of service prioritization to assure 
   timely response for critical FMS packets. 

11.5. Constrained Devices 

   The network may be composed of a heterogeneous mix of full, battery 
   and energy harvested devices.  The routing protocol must support 
   these constrained devices. 

    

11.5.1. Proxying for Constrained Devices 

   Routing must support in-bound packet caches for low-power (battery 
   and energy harvested) devices when these devices are not accessible 
   on the network.   

   These devices must have a designated powered proxying device to which 
   packets will be temporarily routed and cached until the constrained 
   device accesses the network. 

    

11.6. Reliability 

 11.6.1. Device Integrity 

   Commercial Building devices must all be periodically scanned to 
   assure that the device is viable and can communicate data and alarm

   information as needed. Network routers should maintain previous 
   packet flow information temporally to minimize overall network 
   overhead.
