Internet-Draft    The Camellia CMAC-96 and CMAC-PRF-128    November 2007


1.  Introduction

   This memo specifies two new alogorithms.  One is the usage of CMAC
   based on Camellia block cipher on the authentication mechanism of the
   IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [4] and Authentication
   Header protocols (AH) [3].  This algorithm is called
   Camellia-CMAC-96.  Latter is Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) based on
   CMAC with Camellia block cipher for Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [5].
   This algoritm is called Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128.

   Camellia is a symmetric cipher with a Feistel structure.  Camillia
   was developed jointly by NTT and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation in
   2000.  It was designed to withstand all known cryptanalytic attacks,
   and it has been scrutinized by worldwide cryptographic experts.
   Camellia is suitable for implementation in software and hardware,
   offering encryption speed in software and hardware implementations
   that is comparable to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [17].

   Camellia supports 128-bit block size and 128-, 192-, and 256-bit key
   lengths, i.e., the same interface specifications as the AES.
   Therefore developers can implement Camellia based alogorithms without
   large amount of modification by replacing AES block of AES based
   algorithms to Camellia block.

   Camellia is adopted as IETF and several international standardization
   organizations.  Camellia is already adopted as IPSec [14], TLS [12],
   S/MIME [9] and XML [10].  Camellia is adopted for the one of three
   ISO/IEC international standard cipher [20] as 128bit block cipher
   (Camellia AES and SEED).  Camellia was selected as a recommended
   cryptographic primitive by the EU NESSIE (New European Schemes for
   Signatures, Integrity and Encryption) project [18] and was included
   in the list of cryptographic techniques for Japanese e-Government
   systems that was selected by the Japan CRYPTREC (Cryptography
   Research Evaluation Committees) [19].

   Since optimized source code is provided by several open source
   lisences [21], Camellia is also adopted by several open source
   projects(Openssl, FreeBSD, Linux and Gran Paradiso).  Additional API
   for Network Security Services (NSS) and IPsec stack of Linux and Free
   BSD are prepared or working progress for release.

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [7].

   The Camellia homepage [22] contains a wealth of information about
   Camellia, including detailed specification, security analysis,
   performance figures, reference implementation, optimized
   implementetion, test vectors, and intellectual property information.

Internet-Draft    The Camellia CMAC-96 and CMAC-PRF-128    November 2007


   This doucment specifies the usage of CMAC with Camellia Block cipher
   on the authentication mechanism of the IPsec Encapsulating Security
   Payload [4] and Authentication Header [3] protocols.  This new
   algorithm is named Camellia-CMAC-96.

   NIST CMAC specification document [1] describes a method to use the
   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as a Message Authentication Code
   (MAC) that has a 128-bit output length.  The 128-bit output is useful
   as a long-lived pseudo- random function (PRF).  This document also
   specifies a PRF based on CMAC with Camellia block cipher that
   supports fixed and variable key sizes for IKEv2 [5] Key Derivation
   Function (KDF) and authentication.  This new alogrithm is named
   Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128.  For further information on IKE, AH and ESP,
   refer to [5], [3], [4] and [6].

   This document does not cover implementation details of CMAC.  Those
   details can be found in [1].

3.  Camellia-CMAC

   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
   recently specified the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code
   (CMAC).  CMAC [1] is a keyed hash function that is based on a
   symmetric key block cipher, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard
   [17].  The CMAC algorithm provides a framework for inserting various
   block cipher algorithm.

   Camellia-CMAC uses the Camellia block cipher [7] as a building block
   in CMAC [1].  To generate a MAC, Camelllia-CMAC takes a secret key, a
   message of variable length, and the length of the message in octets
   as inputs and returns a fixed-bit string.

4.  Camellia-CMAC-96

   For IPsec message authentication on AH and ESP, Camellia-CMAC-96 MAY
   be used.  Camellia-CMAC-96 is a Camellia-CMAC with 96-bit truncated
   output in MSB-first order.  The output is a 96-bit MAC that will meet
   the default authenticator length as specified in [3].  The result of
   truncation is taken in MSB-first order.

   Figure 1 describes Camellia-CMAC-96 algorithm:

   In step 1, Camellia-CMAC is applied to the message M in length len
   with key K.

   In step 2, the output block T is truncated to 12 octets in MSB-first
   order, and Truncated T (TT) is returned.

5.  Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128

   The Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128 algorithm is identical to Camellia-CMAC
   except that the 128-bit key length restriction is removed.

   IKEv2 [5] uses PRFs for multiple purposes, most notably for
   generating keying material and authentication of the IKE_SA.  The
   IKEv2 specification differentiates between PRFs with fixed key sizes
   and those with variable key sizes.

   When using Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128 as the PRF described in IKEv2,
   Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128 is considered to take fixed size (16 octets)
   keys for generating keying material but it takes variable key sizes
   for authentication.

   That is, when generating keying material, "half the bits must come
   from Ni and half from Nr, taking the first bits of each" as described
   in IKEv2, section 2.14; but for authenticating with shared secrets
   (IKEv2, section 2.16), the shared secret does not have to be 16
   octets and the length may vary.

   follows:

   o  If the key, VK, is exactly 128 bits, then we use it as-is.

   o  If it is longer or shorter than 128 bits, then we derive the key,
      K, by applying the Camellia-CMAC algorithm using the 128-bit all-
      zero string as the key and VK as the input message.  This step is
      described in step 1b.

   In step 2, we apply the Camellia-CMAC algorithm using K as the key
   and M as the input message.  The output of this algorithm is
   returned.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security provided by Camellia-CMAC-96 Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128 is
   built on the strong cryptographic algorithm Camellia and CMAC.  At
   the time of this writing, there are no known practical cryptographic
   attacks against Camellia or CMAC.

   However, as is true with any cryptographic algorithm, part of its
   strength lies in the secret key, K, and the correctness of the
   implementation in all of the participating systems.  If the secret
   key is compromised or inappropriately shared, it guarantees neither
   authentication nor integrity of message at all.  The secret key shall
   be generated in a way that meets the pseudo randomness requirement of
   RFC 4086 [11] and should be kept safe.  If and only if
   Camellia-CMAC-96 Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128 are used properly it provides
   the authentication and integrity that meet the best current practice
   of message authentication.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has allocated value <TBD1> for IKEv2 Transform Type 3
   (Integrity Algorithm) to the AUTH_CAMELLIA_CMAC_96 algorithm, and has
   allocated a value of <TBD2> for IKEv2 Transform Type 2 (Pseudo-Random
   Function) to the PRF_CAMELLIA128_CMAC algorithm.
