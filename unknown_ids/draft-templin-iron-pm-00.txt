Abstract

   The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) is a new internetworking
   architecture based on encapsulation of inner network layer packets
   within outer network layer headers using a non-broadcast, multiple
   access (NBMA) virtual interface model.  IRON suggests a third-party
   global deployment of servers and relays to achieve a Provider-
   Independent (PI) routing and addressing framework, but there may be
   instances in which an Internet Service Provider (ISP) wishes to
   manage its own IRON deployment.  This document presents a Provider-
   Managed IRON framework that offers a fast path alternative for

Internet-Draft            Provider-Managed IRON            November 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) [I-D.templin-iron] is a
   new internetworking architecture based on encapsulation of inner
   network layer packets within outer network layer headers using a non-
   broadcast, multiple access (NBMA) virtual interface model.  IRON
   suggests a third-party global deployment of servers and relays to
   achieve a Provider-Independent (PI) routing and addressing framework,
   but there may be instances in which an Internet Service Provider
   (ISP) wishes to manage its own Provider-Managed IRON deployment.

   By managing its own IRON deployment, an ISP can ensure optimal
   placement of servers and relays so that clients receive a high
   quality of service with minimal routing path stretch.  The ISP can
   further delegate native IP prefixes to clients even if they are
   located behind one or several layers of NATs, and even if they move
   between different network points of attachment.  Since most ISPs
   service limited regional areas, however, routing stretch may become
   significant for mobile users that travel far from their homes (e.g.,
   to a different continent).  This situation is no different than that
   for corporate travelers who establish Virtual Private Network (VPN)
   links to their home enterprise networks when they travel abroad, and
   can be mitigated by ISP placement of minimal support infrastructure
   outside of their primary coverage region.

   This document presents a Provider-Managed IRON framework, and shows
   that it can offer ISPs a fast path alternative for deployment of a
   long term solution.


2.  IRON Conceptual Model

   IRON is descended from the RANGER architecture
   [RFC5720][I-D.russert-rangers]; it uses Virtual Enterprise Traversal
   (VET) [I-D.templin-intarea-vet] and the Subnetwork Encapsulation and
   Adaptation Layer (SEAL) [I-D.templin-intarea-seal] as its functional
   building blocks.  IRON uses the VET NBMA virtual interface model for
   coordination between neighboring routers on a virtual overlay
   network.  It also uses SEAL as an IP-in-IP encapsulation sublayer,
   and uses the SEAL Control Message Protocol (SCMP) for signaling
   between tunnel endpoints.  In particular, IRON clients use SEAL and
   SCMP to establish bidirectional tunnels with IRON servers and to
   inform the servers of any outer network layer address changes.  IRON
   clients can also establish unidirectional tunnels to servers that are
   closer to the final destination based on route optimization
   signaling.

   IRON clients connect End User Networks (EUNs) which are assigned EUN

   prefixes (EPs) taken from highly-aggregated IP prefixes known as
   Virtual Prefixes (VPs).  IRON servers connect their clients to a
   virtual overlay network configured over an internetwork such as the
   global Internet.  IRON relays in turn connect the virtual overlay
   network to the native (i.e., non-IRON) Internet.  The IRON relays in
   the virtual overlay network belong to a single Autonomous System (AS)
   and use eBGP to advertise the VPs externally into the native Internet
   default-free routing system.  IRON relays and servers further use an
   interior routing protocol such as iBGP to track the EPs assigned to
   clients.

   To provide better service to clients, sufficient numbers of IRON
   relays and servers should be uniformly distributed throughout the
   internetwork over which the virtual overlay network is configured.
   Since the number of IRON servers needed may be very large, each
   server is required only to keep track of its own set of clients and
   to convey its client constituency to each of the relays.  The iBGP
   peerings between servers and relays is therefore arranged as a
   partial mesh in which servers report their client constituencies to
   each relay but not to other servers.  In this arrangement, servers
   have partial topology information and relays have full topology
   information.  Routing within the virtual overlay network may
   therefore direct the initial packets in a flow through a suboptimal
   path that involves extraneous relays and servers as intermediate
   hops, but redirect messages will quickly inform the client of a
   better route.

   Figure 1 below depicts an example Provider-Managed IRON deployment:

   packets further to Server(B).  Server(B) then forwards the packets
   via the bidirectional tunnel to Client(B), where they are forwarded
   across EUN(B) and delivered to Host B. Following the redirect
   messages, subsequent packets flow directly via a unidirectional

   tunnel from Client(A) to Server(B) with the Relay and Server(A)
   removed from the path.

   In case 2, packets sourced from Host(A) are forwarded through EUN(A)
   to Client(A), which forwards them via the bidirectional tunnel to
   Server(A).  Server(A) then forwards them to a Relay, which in turn
   forwards them via normal Internet routing until they reach host C.

   In case 3, packets sourced from host C are forwarded through normal
   Internet routing until they reach a Relay that connects the Provider-
   Managed virtual overlay network to the rest of the Internet.  The
   Relay then forwards the packets to Server(A), where they are
   forwarded through the bidirectional tunnel to Client(A) then
   delivered to Host(A).

   These fundamental communication flow archetypes apply to the case of
   IRON virtual overlay networks configured over the unbounded global
   Internet when a third party supplies EUNs with PI prefixes.  However,
   the same archetypes apply when the virtual overlay network is
   configured over a more limited topology such as an ISP's service
   network where the IP prefixes assigned to EUNs are Provider-Managed.
   The following section discusses a Provider-Managed IRON model.


3.  Provider-Managed IRON

   The generic IRON use case assumes that the internetwork over which
   IRON overlay networks will be configured is the Internet itself.  In
   other words, the generic use case assumes a global deployment of
   relays and servers by a third-party agency that does not coordinate
   with any specific ISPs.  In that case, the VPs/EPs served by the
   third party would be independent of any Provider-Managed prefix
   space, and hence would be PI.  However, an ISP wishing to roll out a
   useful service for its customers could choose to establish an IRON
   deployment using its own service network as the internetwork over
   which the virtual overlay is configured.  In that case, the VPs/EPs
   serviced by the ISP would be Provider-Managed and there would be no
   third-party agencies for customers to coordinate with.  The ISP would
   also be in the best position to provide optimal or nearly-optimal
   placement of IRON relays and servers within its managed network.

   When an ISP deploys its own IRON virtual overlay system, it
   establishes relays at the border of the virtual overlay network that
   connect the overlay to the global Internet.  These relays run eBGP on
   their Internet-facing interfaces, and advertise the VPs that have
   been delegated to the ISP.  The ISP should only need to advertise a
   small number of VPs that would only very rarely need to be withdrawn
   and re-announced within the global routing system.  The ISP also

   deploys servers close to its customer EUNs in sufficient numbers so
   that the customers receive a high quality of service.  While the IRON
   architecture allows for the relay and server function to be deployed
   on the same physical platform, for reasons of scaling it is expected
   that they will often be deployed on separate platforms.

   In terms of scaling, in the limiting case in which all of the ISP's
   IRON routers provide both the relay and server function, the relay/
   servers would engage in a full mesh iBGP session the same as
   described in the Softwire Mesh Framework [RFC5565].  However, a full
   mesh framework would present a limiting factor for scaling in
   multiple dimensions.

   First, each relay/server would only be able to service a limited set
   of customer client EUNs, since each client requires that the server
   maintain bidirectional tunnel state and engage in periodic keepalive
   exchanges.  Second, since an ISP wishing to support a large number of
   customer clients would need to deploy a large number of relay/
   servers, the number of iBGP peering sessions between them would grow
   with the square of the number of relay/servers.  This scaling
   situation can be addressed through the use of route reflectors, but
   the route reflectors cannot convey reachability state from one relay/
   server to another.  Moreover, there is no reason that each server
   needs to have full knowledge of all EPs assigned to all customer
   EUNs.  Instead, it should only have to know about the EPs assigned to
   its own current set of client customers and maintain a default route
   pointing to the relay router anycast address.

   Hence, when the server and relay functions are deployed on separate
   platforms, the IRON system enables a "partial mesh" topology in which
   servers report only the EP-to-client relationships for all of their
   client customers and maintain default routes to relays.  Relays in
   turn discover all EP-to-server relationships and thus have full
   topology knowledge of the EP distributions throughout the ISP
   network.  Moreover, servers can be placed close to the customers to
   support optimal routes, and more servers can be added as the client
   load grows.

   As an example, assume that an ISP deploys a Provider-Managed IRON
   deployment using a single IPv6 ::/24 VP, from which it assigns IPv6
   ::/56 EPs to its client customers.  The ISP can establish a
   reasonable number of relays (e.g., 100) at the virtual overlay
   network border with the Internet.  The ISP could then uniformly
   distribute a sufficient number of servers (e.g., 2^16) located close
   to customers throughout its network, where each server would be sized
   to serve 2^16 customers.  Such a deployment would enable service for
   all 2^32 ::/56 EPs taken from the single ::/24 VP while advertising
   only a single VP into the global routing system.  Each of the 100

Internet-Draft            Provider-Managed IRON            November 2010


   relays would need to maintain iBGP peering sessions with each of the
   2^16 servers to discover all client-to-server mappings in the IRON
   system.  Each of the 2^16 servers would only need to report their
   client constituency via the 100 iBGP peering sessions and would not
   need to discover the client constituencies of other servers since
   they only require the relay router anycast address as the default
   route.

   Since the servers would have only partial topology information (i.e.,
   they would only know about their own clients and about the relay
   anycast default route) packets originated by one of their clients A
   and destined to a client B that is serviced by a different server
   would need to be forwarded through a relay.  Using the IRON secure
   redirection system, however, the relay would return a redirect
   message which the server would forward to the client customer.
   Thereafter, packets originating from client A and destined to client
   B would be forwarded directly to client B's server without involving
   either client A's server nor any relays.  This technique is often
   known as route optimization, and is a fundamental requirement for any
   production-quality routing system.


4.  Dealing with NATs

   In typical ISP deployments, customer EUNs are located behind Customer
   Premises Equipment (CPE) routers that perform a Network Address
   Translation (NAT) function internally.  With the impending runout of
   IPv4 addresses, ISPs are now also faced with a situation in which
   they may need to assign private-use IP addresses to the outward-
   facing interfaces of CPEs and perform a second level of NATing
   withing the ISP network.  Hence, devices in customer EUNs will be
   located behind one or several layers of NATs which impart special
   requirements on tunneling technologies.  In particular, tunneling
   technologies will need to be configured over the UDP protocol which
   can traverse NATs.

   In the 6a44 proposal [I-D.despres-softwire-6a44], the authors present
   a novel method of supporting IPv6 clients in EUNs through stateless
   coordinations with servers in the ISP network.  Each client in this
   model receives only a single address that is constructed based on the
   outer NAT address and port mapping values, however, and these values
   can change across NAT reboots and/or loss of state.  Hence, it may
   not be practical for administrators to represent the 6a44 addresses
   in a static name resolution system such as the DNS and/or for
   communicating peers to rely on a stable address for session
   continuity.

   Using the Provider-Managed IRON approach and its constituent SEAL

Internet-Draft            Provider-Managed IRON            November 2010


   mechanism, however, a client device in the customer EUN can receive
   an EP from its service provider (e.g., an IPv6 ::/56) and then
   register this EP with a nearby server that it discovers through an
   anycast router solicitation.  Once registered, the server distributes
   this new EP registration to all relays.

   This stateful registration establishes next hop information in the
   server which the client must refresh periodically by sending beacons
   which have the side effect of keeping state alive in any NATs on the
   path.  Since NATs may lose state and create new mappings, however,
   the server does not rely on the IP address and port mapping
   information to identify the client.  Instead it relies on the SEAL
   identification tags that were established when the client first
   registered with the server.  In this arrangement, it does not matter
   if the address and port mappings change periodically as long as the
   client sends beacons frequently enough to keep the NAT state
   synchronized with the server state.


5.  Dealing with Mobility

   When a client moves to a new network point of attachment, it simply
   sends a new anycast router solicitation message to register with a
   new server.  Unlike the global IRON case, however, a client in a
   Provider-Managed IRON deployment can only discover a server in its
   home ISP even if it has moved far away from home.  For example, if a
   customer from ISP A located in the United States takes their IRON
   client router to Beijing they can still continue to use their
   Provider-Managed EPs, but all traffic to and from the EPs would need
   to be routed through the relays and servers in the ISP A US-based
   network even if both correspondent hosts are located in Beijing.
   Although clearly not optimal, this situation is no different than for
   a corporate employee who takes their laptop to a distant country and
   uses a VPN to connect to their home office.

   However, if ISP A wishes to provide better mobility service to its
   customers, it can deploy additional relays and servers in the
   networks of other ISPs worldwide simply by leasing public IP
   addresses and establishing equipment in the foreign ISPs networks.
   In that case, the Provider-Managed IRON case begins to look identical
   to the Provider-Independent case, and mobile clients can achieve a
   high quality of service even if they have moved far away from their
   home network.  It therefore becomes immaterial as to whether the
   customer would pay an ISP for their IRON services or pay some third
   party entity - the service they would receive would be equivalent and
   dependent only on the quality of the IRON deployment.
