Abstract

   This document defines optional extensions to the Bundle Protocol [2]
   for supporting the custodial multicast delivery of bundles within a
   Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN).  The protocol extensions described
   herein may be used to support custody transfer and custody-based
   reforwarding during the transmission of a bundle from a single source
   node to multiple destination nodes.

1.  Introduction

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   Multicasting as defined in the DTN context is the ability of a source
   bundle node to transmit a bundle to a destination multicast endpoint
   without necessarily having to originate a separate bundle for each
   bundle node that is registered in that endpoint.  The Bundle Protocol
   [2] is designed to support delivery of bundles to all types of
   endpoints (singleton, anycast, and multicast), but it only supports
   custodial delivery (custody transfer and custody-based re-forwarding)
   of bundles that are sent to singleton endpoints.  Its custodial
   delivery mechanisms are not applicable to bundles sent to multicast
   endpoints.

   The Bundle Protocol extensions to support custodial multicast that
   are described in this document are OPTIONAL for deployment with the
   Bundle Protocol.  Use of these extensions is also OPTIONAL.  Bundle
   Protocol implementations that claim to be custodial-multicast-capable
   (CMC) MUST support all of the features defined herein, as well as all
   of the features defined in the Bundle Protocol [2].  In addition, in
   any given network that purports to support custodial multicast
   delivery, a multicast routing protocol is also required to set up the
   multicast distribution path.  The extensions defined in this document
   are multicast-routing-protocol-independent in the sense that they are
   designed to work with any multicast routing protocol, providing that
   the multicast routing protocol meets certain requirements, which are
   defined in Section 4.

1.1.  Related Documents

   This document is best read and understood within the context of the
   following other DTN documents:

      - The Delay-Tolerant Network Architecture [6] defines the
      architecture for delay-tolerant networks, but only briefly
      discusses multicasting.

      - The Bundle Protocol Specification [2] defines the format and
      processing of the blocks used to implement the basic bundle
      protocol.  This document does not explicitly discuss DTN
      multicast, but it does define two concepts that are important for
      supporting multicast:

         the concept of endpoints that contain multiple nodes, all of
         which are intended recipients of a bundle, and

Internet-Draft     DTN Custodial Multicast Extensions           May 2008


         the concept that a node may both deliver and forward a bundle
         and, when forwarding a bundle, may forward it to multiple next-
         hop nodes.

      The Bundle Protocol also defines custody transfer procedures that
      apply to bundles that are destined for singleton endpoints; these
      custody transfer procedures, however, are explicitly stated to be
      applicable only to bundles that are destined for singleton
      endpoints and, therefore, by implication, not to be applicable to
      bundles that are destined for multicast endpoints.

      - Delay-Tolerant Networking Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation [3]
      defines the format and processing of the Bundle-in-Bundle
      Encapsulation Administrative Record, which is used to enable the
      transmission of one or more bundles encapsulated in another bundle
      as part of that bundle's payload (e.g., one or more multicast
      bundles encapsulated in a singleton bundle).

1.2.  Terminology

   Multicast Endpoint - A bundle endpoint that is permitted to contain
   multiple nodes and that has as its minimum reception group (see [2])
   all of the nodes registered in that endpoint.

   Branching Point - A bundle's delivery path has a branching point at a
   particular node if in the course of delivering the bundle to its
   minimum reception set that node either:

      -delivers the bundle at that node and forwards it to at least one
      next hop node, or

      forwards the bundle to more than one next hop node.

   A node that is a branching point for a bundle is said to "branch"
   that bundle.

   Singleton Bundle - a bundle that has a singleton endpoint ID as its
   destination.

   Multicast Bundle - a bundle that has a multicast endpoint ID as its
   destination.

   Custodial Multicast Bundle - a Bundle that has a multicast endpoint
   ID as its destination and that has its custody transfer requested
   flag (in the bundle processing flags field) set to 1.

   Custodial-multicast-capable (CMC) node - a node that implements all
   of the features defined in this document, as well as all of the

   features defined in the Bundle Protocol [2].

2.  The Basic Problems of Custodial Multicast

   Custody transfer and retransmission, which are defined for singleton
   bundles in the Bundle Protocol [2], are fundamentally complicated
   when applied to multicast bundles.  Upon receipt of a multicast
   bundle, a bundle node may deliver the bundle at that node, forward
   the bundle to one or more next-hop nodes, or both.  If a node
   delivers a bundle and forwards it to at least one next hop node or
   forwards the bundle to more than one next hop node, then the bundle's
   path is said to have a branching point at that node.  Branching
   points cause additional copies of a bundle to be created.  A node
   that takes custody of a multicast bundle and then delivers and/or
   forwards it becomes responsible for all copies of that bundle that it
   delivers or forwards.  In addition, nodes may be branching points for
   bundles without being custodians for those bundles, so a node that
   takes custody of a bundle is not only responsible for all copies of
   that bundle that it delivers or forwards; it also becomes responsible
   for all copies of the bundle that may be created as a result of
   downstream branching at other, non-custodial, branching nodes, until
   the copy is deleted, custody of the copy is transferred to another
   node, or the copy is delivered.  Fulfilling this responsibility for
   all downstream copies is complicated by the fact that the custodian
   does not necessarily have any way of knowing whether or how many
   times a bundle that it forwards will be branched downstream.

   Therefore, to support custodial delivery of multicast bundles, this
   document defines mechanisms to enable a custodian of a multicast
   bundle to determine when all downstream copies of a bundle have
   either been delivered or have been taken custody of by a downstream
   node, and to determine when a specific downstream undelivered bundle
   may need to be retransmitted.  In addition, for purposes of
   conserving bandwidth, it defines a mechanism to enable bundle copies
   to be reforwarded selectively, to only those downstream branches of
   the delivery path that have not yet received them, rather than being
   forwarded indiscriminately to all downstream nodes.

3.  Objectives, Assumptions, and Design Principles

3.1.  Custodial Multicast Objectives

   The objectives of the custodial multicast extensions defined in this
   document are to increase the likelihood that

      -each custodial multicast bundle that is sent will be delivered to
      as many of its destination nodes as possible prior to bundle
      expiration and,

      -if a custodial multicast bundle needs to be re-forwarded in the
      course of being transmitted from source to destination, the cost
      of reforwarding it from the custodian (in terms of the routing
      metric in use) will be less than the cost of reforwarding it from
      the source node or, ideally, though not necessarily, from any
      previous custodian nodes.

   A third objective of custodial multicast delivery, which is not an
   objective that is addressed in this document, is to enable delivery
   of bundles to a node whose registration request for the multicast
   endpoint may be late or delayed.  Even though this registration
   request had not yet propagated through the network sufficiently to
   graft the destination node onto the distribution tree when the bundle
   was sent, a custodian of the bundle can forward the bundle toward the
   late-registering node when the custodian is notified of its
   registration.

   If a bundle has a singleton destination EID, then custodial delivery
   enables it to be stored in the network until the destination node
   registers to receive it and notification of this registration request
   is able to propagate to the custodian (providing the bundle doesn't
   expire first) so that the custodian can forward the bundle toward the
   destination.  Once such a bundle that is sent to a singleton EID
   reaches the (single) node that registers with that EID, the bundle
   may be deleted at its current custodian because it will not need to
   be delivered to any other destination node.  If a bundle has a
   multicast destination EID, on the other hand, there is no inherent
   limit to the number of such registrations that may be received.
   Custodians of multicast bundles may store those bundles in the
   network until they expire in order to ensure that the bundle will be
   available for forwarding to every node that registers late or the
   registration request of which is delayed.  As pointed out in [8], due
   to the unique characteristics of frequent partitioning and
   consequently large transfer delays in DTNs, destination endpoint
   registration changes during data transfer may be the norm rather than
   the exception.

   The protocol extensions defined in this document focus only on
   defining mechanisms to meet the first two objectives presented above.
   They do not address the mechanics of re-forwarding multicast bundles
   to late-registering nodes.

3.2.  Assumptions and Design Principles for Custodial Multicast
      Extensions

   A node may be a branching point for a bundle without taking custody
   of that bundle.  It is not feasible to expect or require that every
   branching point node will always take custody of a bundle.  The
   extensions defined in this document, therefore, take into account the
   possibility that some branching point nodes may not become custodians
   of the custodial multicast bundles that they branch.

   Although we cannot require all branching nodes to become custodians
   for bundles that they branch, we do require all branching nodes to
   maintain a small amount of additional state for each custodially-
   transferred bundle that they branch.  Maintaining this state
   information enables non-custodial branching nodes to keep track of
   the custody status of each copy of the bundles that they branch.
   Given that a bundle's custodian has no awareness of the existence of
   copies of the bundle that are created at non-custodial branching
   nodes downstream of it, the non-custodial branching nodes must act as
   "proxy custodian" in the sense that they must keep track of the
   custody status of each copy they create and in turn report this
   status upstream to the bundle's actual custodian.

   Custodial branching nodes must store a copy of the bundle, re-forward
   it if necessary, and maintain custody state per bundle copy that they
   branch rather than just per bundle (as currently defined in the
   Bundle Protocol).  Non-custodial branching nodes are not required to
   retain a copy of the bundle or re-forward it, but they are, like
   custodial nodes, required to maintain custody state per bundle copy
   that they branch (see Section 5 and Section 8.2.1).

   If a node's forwarding information indicates that it must branch a
   multicast bundle but it does not have the storage capacity or other
   resources necessary to pose as a proxy custodian by maintaining
   custody state per copy of the bundle that it branches then the node
   must report this difficulty to the previous upstream custodian or
   proxy custodian and it must not deliver or forward the bundle as a
   custodially transferred bundle (see Section 8.2.1).

   Unless a custodian is going to re-forward a bundle when needed, the
   custodian cannot be of any use in helping to achieve the two
   objectives that we have identified as our objectives for custodial
   multicast.  Therefore, the extensions we define must include not only



Symington, et al.       Expires November 3, 2008               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft     DTN Custodial Multicast Extensions           May 2008


   the capability to re-forward a multicast bundle when necessary, but
   the ability to determine when re-forwarding is necessary.  In the
   singleton case, a custodian may receive an explicit notification (in
   the form of a "Failed" custody signal) or an implicit notification
   (in the form of an expired custody timer) that it should retransmit a
   bundle.  In the singleton case, a custodian may also receive explicit
   notification (in the form of a "Succeeded" custody signal) when a
   bundle of which it has custody has been either delivered or taken
   custody of by another node.  When enough time has elapsed, as
   measured by the custody timer timing out, during which the custodian
   has not received a "Succeeded" custody signal for a bundle, the
   custodian may re-forward the bundle.

   In the multicast case, in order for the custodian of a multicast
   bundle to know whether or not it needs to re-forward that bundle, the
   custodian need not necessarily know the delivery status of each
   downstream copy of the bundle.  It does, however, need to know
   whether or not there is at least one downstream copy of the bundle
   that has not yet been delivered or taken custody of.  If there is,
   and the custody timer for that copy expires, the custodian must re-
   forward the bundle copy downstream to at least the next-hop node(s)
   with which the expiring timer is associated.  A major component of
   the extensions that we are defining, therefore, is a mechanism by
   which a custodian can be notified when all downstream copies of a
   bundle for which it is custodian have either been delivered or taken
   custody of.  A second component is a mechanism whereby the custodian
   can be explicitly notified of an undelivered downstream copy of a
   bundle that has been deleted.  In our extensions, analogous to the
   way that custody signals operate for the singleton case in the Bundle
   Protocol, receipt of a "Succeeded" custody signal for all copies of
   the bundle that a custodian has branched indicates that all
   downstream copies have either been delivered or taken custody of.
   Failure to receive a "Succeeded" custody signal before a custody
   timer times out indicates that one or more bundle copies associated
   with that timer has not yet been delivered or taken custody of (and
   thus may need to be retransmitted).  Receipt of a "Failed" custody
   signal indicates that the referenced bundle copy was deleted before
   being delivered or taken custody of (and thus may need to be
   retransmitted).

   There is an inherent tradeoff between robustness of delivery and
   bandwidth conservation when custody transfer is requested for a
   multicast bundle.  These extensions give bandwidth conservation
   priority over robustness of delivery by default, but local policy may
   override this.  Unless overridden by local policy that specifically
   attempts to adapt the multicast delivery path in response to network
   dynamism, custodians and non-custodial branching nodes, by default,
   should not forward a multicast bundle copy for which a successful

   custody signal has already been received.  Bundles should only be re-
   forwarded to those next-hop nodes that have downstream copies of the
   bundle that have not yet been delivered or taken custody of.  Because
   the multicast delivery path is assumed to be a tree (see Section 4),
   if a node receives a bundle of which it is currently custodian, the
   bundle is assumed to be in an unintentional loop and must be dropped
   without sending any concomitant custody signal to the asserted
   custodian of the received bundle.

4.  Multicast Routing Protocol Requirements and Desired Features

   In order for the custodial multicast extensions defined in this
   document to work correctly, the multicast routing protocol that is
   used to set up the delivery path for custodial multicast bundles must
   meet certain requirements, which are discussed in the following
   subsections.

4.1.  Only CMC-nodes may be branching points

   As discussed in Section 3.2 and Section 5.2, non-custodial branching
   nodes are required to have the capability to maintain state
   information per bundle copy that they branch.  Because this special
   capability is required of all branching nodes, in order for custodial
   multicast transfer to work correctly, either:

      -the network used for custodial multicast delivery must consist
      only of CMC-nodes, or

      -the multicast routing protocols responsible for delivery path
      formation must be capable of distinguishing CMC-nodes from non-
      CMC-nodes and they must enforce the restriction that only CMC-
      nodes are permitted to be branching points.

   If there are nodes that serve as branching points for multicast
   bundles that do not have the capabilities defined in this document,
   the custody transfer procedures defined in this document will not
   work correctly.  Therefore, in order to support custodial multicast
   in a network that consists of both CMC and non-CMC nodes, the
   multicast routing protocols used must enforce the restriction that
   only CMC nodes are permitted to be branching points in the delivery
   path.  In order for multicast routing protocols to be able to
   distinguish CMC-nodes from non-CMC-nodes, when CMC-nodes register,
   they must make known their status as CMC-nodes and this information
   regarding their status as CMC-nodes must be propagated along with the
   registration information among the nodes that participate in
   multicast routing.

4.2.  Every bundle copy must be able to be individually accounted for

   The extensions defined herein are based on the principle that if a
   bundle is branched because branching is required to enable the bundle
   to reach two different destination nodes, then both the original
   bundle and the branched bundle must be acknowledged with a successful
   custody signal.  On the other hand, if a bundle is branched but both
   the original bundle and the branched bundle are destined for the same
   destination node, then only one of these copies of the bundle must be
   acknowledged with a successful custody signal.  If a branching node

   forwards two copies of a bundle that are not distinguishable from
   each other and some custodial downstream node receives both of these
   copies at the same time, then one of the copies will be deleted and
   will not be acknowledged with a successful custody signal.  The
   custodian that had branched the bundle will received only one
   successful custody signal and, assuming it is expecting two, it will
   retransmit the unacknowledged bundle copy unnecessarily.  On the
   other hand, if a branching node forwards two copies of a bundle that
   are distinguishable from one another and some custodial downstream
   node receives both of these copies at the same time, then because
   these copies are distinguishable the receiving node may generate two
   successful custody signals--one for each copy of the bundle that it
   receives.

   The extensions defined herein require that every bundle copy that is
   destined for its own destination node (such that no other bundle copy
   is destined for that same destination node) must be able to be
   individually accounted for in terms of custody signaling.  This
   requirement may be achieved in one of two known ways:

      -DTN multicast routing protocols must operate over trees rather
      than meshes such that a multicast delivery path is always a tree.
      If the multicast distribution path is guaranteed to be a tree,
      then it is necessarily the case that every copy of a bundle that
      is branched is destined for its own destination node and the
      extensions defined herein are correct in requiring each copy to be
      acknowledged with a successful custody signal.  Any copy that is
      not acknowledged with a successful custody signal must necessarily
      be retransmitted until it a successful custody signal is received
      for it.

      -Every bundle copy that is created must contain a unique custodian
      EID, and nodes receiving two copies of the same bundle that are
      identical except for their custodian EID fields must send a
      separate successful custody signal for each copy of the bundle
      that they receive (to be sent to the EID in the bundle's custodian
      EID field).  In this case, if the multicast distribution path is a
      mesh rather than a tree, there is no danger that a bundle copy
      that is received will not be acknowledged with a successful
      custody signal in the event that the receiving node already has
      custody of a copy of that bundle that was received earlier,
      because the earlier copy will have a distinct custodian EID from
      the recently received copy.  Note that this second method of
      ensuring that each bundle copy will be acknowledged requires
      receiving nodes to be able to distinguish between two copies of
      the same bundle that have different custodian EID values, but that
      are otherwise identical.  This is a capability over and above what
      is required of basic bundle nodes in the Bundle Protocol

      specification.

4.3.  If convergence layer multicast is used, the forwarding node must
      know the number of next-hop recipient nodes

   If DTN multicast is running over an underlying convergence layer
   protocol that has inherent best-effort multicast transmission
   capabilities (e.g. a Local Area Network) and DTN multicast endpoint
   IDs are associated with underlying convergence layer multicast
   addresses, a bundle received at a DTN endpoint ID that is bound to an
   underlying convergence layer multicast address could in turn be
   multicast out toward its multiple destinations using that convergence
   layer.  Using the best-effort multicast capabilities provided by some
   convergence layers, there is no way for the forwarder of such a
   multicast bundle to know in advance the expected number of
   recipients.  Although from the standpoint of the DTN bundle protocol
   agent only a single copy of a bundle is being sent on a particular
   multicast-capable convergence layer, in effect there are multiple
   next-hop nodes that this single copy is intended to reach.  When a
   best-effort multicast-capable convergence layer is used to distribute
   DTN multicast bundles such that the forwarding node does not know the
   number of expected next hops that are reachable via the convergence
   layer, it is impossible for the bundle's custodian to know if and
   when all destinations have received the bundle.

   If unicast forwarding is being used on a given convergence layer, the
   receipt of a "Succeeded" custody signal associated with a particular
   bundle copy forwarded using that convergence layer means that all
   downstream copies of that copy have been either delivered or taken
   custody of.  If multicast forwarding is being used on a given
   convergence layer then, although only a single bundle is being
   forwarded, this bundle may have multiple next hops.  Therefore, in
   order for such a configuration to be able to be used to support
   custodial multicast, the bundle node that is forwarding the bundle
   onto the convergence layer:

      -must be a CMC-node, and

      -must know the number of next-hop nodes that the bundle is
      expected to reach using that convergence layer, so that it can
      maintain state for this number of copies.

4.4.  CMC nodes should keep track of de-registration requests in order
      to be able to distinguish delayed de-registrations from routing
      failures

   In the same way that there is a delay between when a node registers
   and when that registration propagates through the network to graft



Symington, et al.       Expires November 3, 2008               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft     DTN Custodial Multicast Extensions           May 2008


   that node onto the distribution tree, there may also be a delay
   between when a node de-registers with a multicast EID and when that
   de-registration propagates through the network to prune that node
   from the distribution tree.  As a result, a situation may arise in
   which a de-registration request has reached some nodes but not others
   such that a bundle could be forwarded by a custodian (which has not
   yet received notice of the de-registration request) and later
   received at some downstream non-branching node (which has received
   the de-registration request) that does not have any next-hop nodes to
   which the bundle should be forwarded (because the node that recently
   de-registered was the only node downstream of this node that had been
   in the multicast endpoint).  In this situation, the bundle cannot be
   forwarded because there is no known route to its destination.  Nor
   should it be forwarded, because there is no longer an intended
   destination downstream of it.  If the node at which this situation
   occurs has kept track of the fact that it received a de-registration
   notification for the multicast EID in question, it can distinguish
   this type of situation from a real routing failure.  Instead of
   sending a "Failed" custody signal, the node that cannot forward the
   bundle because a downstream node has recently de-registered from the
   multicast EID should send a "Succeeded" custody signal for this
   multicast bundle, because a "Succeeded" custody signal indicates that
   there are no remaining copies of the bundle downstream of this node
   that need to be either delivered or taken custody of.  If the node at
   which this situation occurs has not kept track of the de-registration
   notifications it has received and so cannot distinguish this
   situation from a real routing failure, it will send a "Failed"
   custody signal for this multicast bundle to the bundle's current
   custodian, and the custodian will re-forward the bundle toward the
   node at which the routing failure occurred.  Eventually either the
   bundle will time out or the de-registration request notification will
   propagate to a branching point upstream such that the routing failure
   will no longer exist.  Hence, having nodes in the multicast
   distribution tree keep track of de-registration requests is not
   required in order for the custodial multicast extensions to work
   correctly, but it does optimize bandwidth conservation by eliminating
   unnecessary custody signal transmissions and bundle retransmissions
   on the affected branches of the distribution tree.  State on de-
   registration request notifications received does not have to be
   maintained indefinitely at any given node.  De-registered endpoint
   IDs may be stored with a record of the time at which the de-
   registration request notification was received.  The de-registered
   endpoint ID may be deleted from the state information when enough
   time has elapsed to allow the de-registration request to reasonably
   be assumed to have propagated through the network.  Again, if this
   amount of time is not estimated correctly and the de-registered
   endpoint ID is deleted too soon from the state information, custody
   transfer will still work correctly; it will just not be optimized to

5.  Overview of Mechanisms for Supporting Custodial Multicast

   The following are circumstances under which a custodian may want to
   re-forward a multicast bundle:

      -The custodian received a "Failed" custody signal for the bundle
      from a specific node, in which case it wants to retransmit the
      bundle to that node (and, assuming the network is relatively
      stable, it may want to conserve bandwidth by encapsulating [3] the
      multicast bundle in a singleton bundle for bandwidth-efficient
      transmission to the node that originally generated the "Failed"
      custody signal; this node can then de-encapsulate the multicast
      bundle and forward it further), or

      -One or more of the custodian's custody timers for the bundle
      timed out, in which case it wants to re-forward the bundle on (at
      least) all downstream branches of the distribution path that are
      associated with the expiring timer(s).

      -Notification of a new or delayed registration for a multicast EID
      is received.

   The protocol extensions defined in this document do not address the
   third circumstance listed above: re-forwarding bundles to newly-
   registering or delayed-registration nodes.  They do, however, address
   the first two circumstances listed above by ensuring that the
   custodian will be able to:

      -receive "Failed" custody signals for arbitrary bundle copies from
      nodes downstream in the delivery path

      -be aware of whether or not there exists a downstream copy of that
      bundle that has not been delivered or taken custody of when its
      custody timer times out.

   Custody status notification is provided to each custodian of a
   multicast bundle in the same way that it is provided to each
   custodian of a singleton bundle: by having downstream nodes send
   either "Succeeded" or "Failed" custody signals to the custodian, as
   appropriate.  In the multicast case, however, the custodian must keep
   track of the custody status of each copy of each bundle it forwards.
   When the custodian receives a "Succeeded" custody signal for each of
   the copies that it branched, the custodian is assured that every
   downstream copy has either been delivered or taken custody of.  Until
   the custodian receives such a signal for any given copy that it
   forwarded, it must assume that there is at least one copy of the
   bundle on that copy's branch of the distribution tree that has
   neither been delivered nor taken custody of.



Symington, et al.       Expires November 3, 2008               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft     DTN Custodial Multicast Extensions           May 2008


   Although the custodian expects one "Succeeded" custody signal per
   bundle copy that it branched, there may be more copies of the bundle
   created downstream of it.  These copies, however, must be kept track
   of by the non-custodial branching nodes that create them.  When all
   copies created by a non-custodial branching node have either been
   delivered or taken custody of, the branching node sends a "Succeeded"
   custody signal to report this to the bundle's previous upstream
   custodian or non-custodial branching node, and so forth, until the
   status of every copy that the custodian branched is reported to the
   custodian.  There is no need for the custodian itself to be made
   aware of every copy of the bundle that is created downstream of it.
   To achieve this "relayed" custody signal transmission, every non-
   custodial node that is a branching point for a multicast bundle, upon
   receipt of that bundle, takes note of its current custodian and then
   places its own EID into the bundle to list itself as custodian for
   that bundle before forwarding the bundle (even though it really is
   not the custodian of the bundle in the sense that it is not storing a
   copy of the bundle in permanent storage, nor does it consider itself
   responsible for retransmitting the bundle).  In this way, each
   branching point node is assured that it will receive any custody
   signals that may be generated for the bundle copies that it branches.

   Note that in order for custody signals to be received at custodians,
   there must be connectivity from the node that is generating the
   custody signal back to the custodian.  This is true for the custody
   transfer of both singleton and multicast bundles.  In the multicast
   case, there must also be connectivity from the node that is
   generating the custody signal back to its nearest upstream proxy
   custodian (if there is one), and from each proxy custodian to its
   nearest upstream proxy custodian and so forth to the real custodian.
   If this connectivity does not exist, the protocol will still work,
   but the custodian may issue one or more custodial retransmissions
   that are unnecessary and therefore wasteful of bandwidth.

   Non-CMC and CMC nodes alike are permitted to originate and deliver
   custodial multicast bundles, to register in multicast EIDS, and to
   forward custodial multicast bundles to a single next-hop node.  As is
   made clear in the Bundle Protocol, however, non-CMC nodes, are not
   permitted to take custody of multicast bundles.  In order for a node
   to be able to become a custodian for a multicast bundle, the node
   must implement the procedures defined in this specification, which
   make it a CMC node.

   In addition, nodes that implement only the base bundle protocol are
   not permitted to be branching points in the distribution path for a
   custodially-transferred multicast bundle.  In order for a node to be
   able to be a branching point in the distribution path of a
   custodially-transferred multicast bundle, the node must be a CMC

   node.  The following sub-sections discuss the specific
   responsibilities that CMC-nodes must fulfill in order to act as
   custodians or branching points in support of the delivery of
   custodial multicast bundles.

5.1.  Special Responsibilities of Custodial Nodes

   When a CMC-node becomes custodian of a multicast bundle, that
   custodial node takes on responsibilities similar to those that are
   taken on by a custodian of a singleton bundle.  The main difference,
   however, is that the custodian of a multicast bundle must maintain
   custody-related state information per copy of that bundle that it
   branches rather than just per bundle.  Specifically, the custodian of
   a given multicast bundle:

      -MUST maintain a list of the copies of that bundle that it has
      branched along with the EID/convergence layer to which each copy
      was delivered or forwarded.

      -MUST keep track of which of these copies for which it has
      received a "Succeeded" custody signal.

      -MUST retain the multicast bundle that it takes custody of--in
      persistent storage if possible-- until the bundle expires or
      (assuming that accommodating late- or delayed-registering
      destination nodes is not a concern) until it receives a
      "Succeeded" custody signal for each of the copies of the bundle
      that it branched (which indicates that all downstream copies of
      that bundle have either been delivered or taken custody of).

      -MUST maintain at least one retransmission timer for the bundle;
      possibly one timer per copy it has branched.

      -SHOULD retransmit the copy (or copies) of the bundle
      corresponding to the retransmission timer when the retransmission
      timer expires.

      -SHOULD retransmit a copy of the bundle referred to by a received
      "Failed" custody signal, perhaps encapsulated (see [3]) in a
      unicast bundle sent to the "Failed" signal's source.

      -MUST destroy a retransmission timer when "Succeeded" custody
      signals for all bundle copies associated with that timer have been
      received

      -MUST delete a multicast bundle and all its associated custodial
      state information when the bundle expires

5.2.  Special Responsibilities of (Non-Custodial) Branching Nodes

   If a node is a branching point for a custodial multicast bundle but
   it does not take custody of that custodial multicast bundle, the node
   must pose as a proxy custodian by inserting its own EID into the
   custodian field of the bundle so that it will receive custody signals
   (if sent) for all copies of the bundle that it branches.  In
   particular, in order to support custodial delivery of a multicast
   bundle, a non-custodial branching node:

      -MUST maintain a list of the copies of that bundle that it has
      branched along with the EID/convergence layer to which each copy
      was delivered or forwarded.

      -MUST keep track of the "Succeeded" custody signals received.

      -MUST notify the appropriate upstream node (e.g. the node that had
      been listed as the bundle's custodian when the bundle was
      received, which is either the bundle's "real" custodian or the
      most recent proxy custodian that may in turn pass the signal
      upstream until it eventually reaches its real custodian) when a
      "Succeeded" custody signal is received for all of the copies of
      the bundle that it branched (which indicates that all downstream
      copies of that bundle have either been delivered or taken custody
      of).

      -If custody transfer failure is reported for any of the downstream
      copies that the bundle branched, the non-custodial branching node
      MUST generate a replacement "Failed" custody signal and send it to
      the appropriate upstream node, inserting a Proxy EID extension
      block (see Section 7) into this bundle (if there is not one in
      there already) that identifies the endpoint of the source of the
      original "Failed" custody signal.  (If custody transfer failure is
      reported for multiple downstream copies that the bundle branched,
      the non-custodial node may aggregate these by inserting multiple
      corresponding Proxy EID extension blocks, each of which identifies
      a different source node, into the replacement "Failed" custody
      signal that it generates and sends to the appropriate upstream
      node.)

      -Upon receipt of a custodial multicast bundle, determine not only
      to which next-hop nodes the bundle should be forwarded in order to
      reach all of the nodes in its multicast endpoint, but also from
      which of these next-hop nodes (if any) the branching node has
      already received a "Succeeded" custody signal for this bundle.  By
      default, but subject to network stability conditions and local
      policy, the bundle SHOULD be forwarded to only those next-hop
      nodes for which a "Succeeded" custody signal for the bundle has

Internet-Draft     DTN Custodial Multicast Extensions           May 2008


      not been received.  (Forwarding the bundle to only those next-hop
      nodes for which a "Succeeded" custody signal for the bundle has
      not yet been received rather than to all next-hop nodes is an
      optimization for bandwidth conservation purposes; it is not a
      requirement.)

      -If the node does not have sufficient resources to maintain the
      state information required of it in order for it to branch a
      particular multicast bundle, it MUST send a "Failed" custody
      signal to the appropriate upstream node.  It MAY (subject to
      policy) reset the custody transfer requested bit and branch the
      bundle.  If the branching node resets the custody transfer
      requested bit and branches the bundle, the reason code in the
      "Failed" custody signal MUST be the new reason code, "Bundle
      Forwarded Non-Custodially".  If the branching node does not reset
      the custody transfer requested bit and branch the bundle, the
      reason code in the "Failed" custody signal MUST be "Depleted
      Storage".  In addition, if the node's resource depletion is
      expected to last a while, the node MAY change the way it
      represents itself to the multicast routing protocol (subject to
      the specifics of that protocol), thereby actively seeking to not
      be a branching point in any multicast distribution paths that are
      set up by that routing protocol.

6.  Identifying Bundle Copies

   A main purpose of multicasting a bundle to several destination nodes
   rather than unicasting the bundle to each of those nodes individually
   is to conserve bandwidth.  In keeping with this objective of
   bandwidth conservation, as mentioned in Section 3, if there is a
   custody transfer failure of one downstream copy of a bundle whereas
   all other downstream copies of that bundle have had successful
   custody transfers or deliveries, it would conserve bandwidth to
   retransmit the bundle only along those branches of the downstream
   delivery path that are necessary for the bundle to reach the node at
   which the custody transfer failure occurred, rather than having that
   bundle traverse all downstream branches of the delivery tree--even
   those leading to nodes that have already successfully taken custody
   of or delivered the bundle.  Performing such bandwidth optimization,
   however, requires branching nodes to be able to distinguish the
   various copies of a given bundle that they deliver or forward from
   each other, so that when a custody signal is received, the receiving
   node can determine not only which bundle it refers to, but which
   particular copy of the bundle that was branched it refers to.
   Furthermore, in order to perform bandwidth-efficient retransmissions
   that target only those next-hop nodes that still have downstream
   copies of the bundle for which "Succeeded" custody signals have not
   been received, the node receiving a custody signal must be able to
   determine to which next-hop node the particular copy of the bundle
   referred to by that signal had been forwarded.  Because we cannot
   rely on the fact that the custody signal for a given bundle copy will
   always be returned via the same route along which the bundle was
   forwarded, the requirement that branching nodes be able to
   distinguish among bundle copies requires the branching node to
   somehow mark each bundle copy uniquely.  This marking could be
   accomplished using a to-be-defined bundle extension block, but such a
   technique would require each branching node to add such a block,
   thereby adding to the size of the bundle.  It would also require that
   procedures be defined for determining when these blocks could be
   deleted from the bundle, and in general it would complicate the
   protocol.  Instead, we recommend that a certain portion of the EID
   that the branching node inserts into the bundle's custodian field be
   used as a copy identifier.  For example, suppose a node is forwarding
   a multicast bundle to two different next-hop nodes.  This forwarding
   node could be registered in two singleton EIDs, e.g., NodeA:1 and
   NodeA:2 and it can be uniquely identified by only the scheme name
   (e.g., "NodeA:") portion the EID [10].  The forwarding node places
   EID "NodeA:1" in the current custodian field of the bundle that it
   forwards to the first next-hop node and EID "NodeA:2" in the current
   custodian field of the bundle that it forwards to the second next-hop
   node.  When it receives a custody signal back for this bundle, it can
   use the EID to which the signal was sent to determine to which copy

   of the bundle the signal refers.  This technique of distinguishing
   the multicast bundle copies from each other is conserving of both
   bandwidth and protocol complexity.  Ideally, it would be defined as
   part of the multicast EID naming scheme and integrated with the
   routing protocols to the extent that only one registration per node
   would have to be propagated because only a certain portion of the EID
   would be used to route to each node.

   Note, however, that as topology changes, new EIDS would need to be
   created to accommodate newly-discovered/encountered neighbors, and
   old EIDs would not be able to be recovered until after the latest
   expiration time of any bundle containing that EID.  Hence, branching
   nodes that use this technique to distinguish among bundle copies
   would also have to keep track of the largest expiration time of the
   bundles associated with each next-hop EID.

   Note also that depending on the type of convergence layer being used
   to forward the bundle copy, the bundle copy may no longer be
   identified uniquely when it is received at its next-hop node.  If a
   copy is forwarded on a unicast convergence layer, then it is expected
   to be received at exactly one next-hop node, and the EID placed in
   the current custodian field, for example, can be used to identify it
   uniquely both when it is forwarded and when it is received.  If a
   copy is forwarded over a multicast convergence layer, however, then
   the EID that is placed in the current custodian field is only
   guaranteed to identify the copy uniquely when the copy is forwarded;
   there is no guarantee that this copy will still be uniquely
   identified by that current custodian EID when it is received, because
   it may be received at multiple next-hop nodes and thereby become
   several different copies, all of which have the same EID in the
   current custodian field.  Therefore, if a custodial multicast bundle
   is forwarded over a multicast convergence layer, the forwarding node
   must know the number of next-hop nodes to which it is destined (as
   discussed in Section 4.3).  The EID placed in the current custodial
   field will be the same in each copy of the bundle received at these
   next-hop nodes.  Therefore, for purposes of keeping track of
   "Succeeded" custody signals received, the forwarding node must expect
   the appropriate number of custody signals referring to bundles with
   this particular current custodian EID.  For purposes of
   retransmission as a result of the custody timer associated with these
   copies timing out or as a result of the receipt of a "Failed" custody
   signal associated with one of these copies, a copy re-forwarded on
   the multicast convergence layer will reach all next-hop nodes that
   are reachable via that convergence layer and will not be targeted to
   reach any specific one of these next-hop nodes in particular.

7.  Proxy EID Extension Block

   This section defines the format of the Proxy EID Extension Block that
   a proxy custodian inserts into a "Failed" custody signal to inform
   the real custodian that eventually receives the "Failed" signal (or a
   replacement of the "Failed" signal) the endpoint ID of the node that
   was originally the source of the "Failed" signal.  A bundle may
   contain multiple Proxy EID Extension Blocks, each of which identifies
   a node that was the source of a "Failed" custody signal for the
   identified bundle.  For more discussion of when this block is
   inserted into a bundle containing a "Failed" custody signal and how
   it is processed, see Section 8.2.10.

   The Proxy EID Extension Block uses the Canonical Bundle Block Format
   as defined in the Bundle Protocol [2].  That is, it is comprised of
   the following elements:

      -Block-type code (one byte) - defined as in all bundle protocol
      blocks except the primary bundle block (as described in the Bundle
      Protocol).  The block type code for the Proxy EID Extension Block
      is 0x06

      -Block processing control flags (SDNV) - defined as in all bundle
      protocol blocks except the primary bundle block (as described in
      the Bundle Protocol).  SDNV encoding is described in the bundle
      protocol.  In order for custodial multicast transfer to be
      supported correctly in a network that consists of a mixture of
      CMC-nodes and non-CMC-nodes, the following block processing
      control flags MUST NOT be set:

         -Discard block if it can't be processed.

         -Discard bundle if block can't be processed.

      The following block processing control flag MUST be set:

         Block contains an EID-reference field.

      -EID references - composite field defined in [2] containing
      references to one or more EIDs.  Presence of EIDs is indicated by
      the "block contains an EID-reference field" flag in the block
      processing control flags, which must be set to 1.  Each of the
      EIDs referenced in this field identify a node that originally
      generated a "Failed" custody signal for the indicated bundle.  The
      sequence of the EIDs reference in this field correlates with the
      sequence of custodial signal information records that appears
      later in this block, insofar as the node identified by a given EID
      reference generated a "Failed" custody signal for the indicated

      bundle with a custody signal reason code and generation time as
      indicated by the corresponding custody signal information record.

      -Block data length (SDNV) - defined as in all bundle protocol
      blocks except the primary bundle block.  SDNV encoding is
      described in the bundle protocol.

      -Block-type-specific data field as follows:

         -Ordered sequence of custody signal information records, where
         a custody signal information record is defined to consist of a
         (1-byte) status field followed by a (DTN time) Time of signal
         field.  These fields are as defined in the Custody Signals
         section of the Bundle Protocol [2].

8.  Bundle Protocol Extensions to Support Custody Transfer and
    Retransmission for Multicast Bundles

   The Bundle Protocol defines custody transfer and retransmission only
   for singleton bundles.  Nodes that implement only the bundle protocol
   are not capable of generally supporting the custody transfer and
   retransmission of multicast bundles.  They are only capable of
   supporting the custodial delivery of multicast bundles if they serve
   neither as custodians nor as branching points in the delivery path.
   The sections below define the custody transfer and retransmission
   capabilities that a node must have in order to be CMC and to
   therefore be capable of supporting custodial transfer and
   retransmission for multicast bundles regardless of where that node is
   located in the delivery path.

   All nodes that are going to either take custody of a multicast bundle
   or serve as a branching point of a multicast bundle must implement
   not only the Bundle Protocol but also the following extensions to the
   Bundle Protocol in order to be able to support custodial multicast.
   Nodes that are neither custodians nor branching points may
   participate in the delivery of custodial multicast bundles without
   implementing these extensions.  If custodial multicast is to be
   supported in a network that consists of both CMC nodes and non-CMC
   nodes, the multicast routing protocol is required to build the
   distribution path with only CMC nodes as branching points.

8.1.  Definitions

   Custody - Custody of a bundle whose destination is a multicast
   endpoint is released when notification is received for each copy of
   the bundle that was delivered or forwarded by the custodian that some
   other node has accepted custody of the copy, the copy has been
   delivered at some destination node, or the bundle has been explicitly
   deleted for some reason, such as lifetime expiration.

8.2.  Bundle Processing Steps for Custodial Multicast Bundles

   The specific steps for processing a custodial multicast bundle at
   each node are defined as follows.

8.2.1.  Bundle Forwarding

   This section augments the Bundle Forwarding section of the Bundle
   Protocol [2].  It defines those steps for forwarding bundles that are
   specific to custodial multicast bundles.

   If the bundle will be forwarded to more than one next-hop node and
   the forwarding node has not accepted custody of the bundle, then the



Symington, et al.       Expires November 3, 2008               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft     DTN Custodial Multicast Extensions           May 2008


   node MUST determine if it has sufficient resources to serve as a
   branching point for the bundle.  If it cannot serve as a branching
   point, the node MUST send a "Failed" custody signal to the upstream
   node that is listed as the bundle's custodian (which is either the
   "real custodian" or the most recent proxy custodian that will in turn
   pass the signal upstream until it eventually reaches the real
   custodian).  It may also (subject to policy) reset the custody
   transfer requested bit and deliver and/or forward the bundle.  If the
   branching node is delivering or forwarding the bundle (non-
   custodially), the reason code in the "Failed" custody signal must be
   the new reason code, "Bundle Forwarded Non-Custodially".  If the
   branching node is not delivering or forwarding the bundle, the reason
   code in the "Failed" custody signal must be "Depleted Storage".

   If the node does have sufficient resources to enable it to serve as a
   non-custodial branching point, then:

      -The node must note the endpoint ID of the bundle's current
      custodian and store it with the custodial state information
      associated with the bundle.

      -The node must change the current custodian endpoint ID in the
      bundle's primary block to the endpoint ID of one of the singleton
      endpoints in which the node is registered.  In order to be able to
      identify each copy uniquely and associate each copy of the bundle
      with the next-hop node to which it will be delivered or forwarded,
      the node should use a separate custodian endpoint ID for each copy
      of the bundle that it delivers or forwards.  Alternatively, it may
      mark the copy in some other as-yet-undefined way.  (Note that if
      the node is forwarding a copy on a multicast convergence layer and
      this copy is expected to reach multiple next-hop endpoints, each
      of the copies received at each of these next-hop nodes will have
      the same custodian EID.)

      -The node must also keep track of whether the bundle is being
      delivered and each of the copies that is being forwarded (both
      explicit copies and copies that may be engendered by the use of a
      multicast convergence layer), along with whether or not a
      "Succeeded" custody signal has been received corresponding to each
      of these copies.  (If a copy is being forwarded on a unicast
      convergence layer, a single custody signal related to that copy is
      expected.  If a copy is forwarded on a multicast convergence
      layer, n custody signals associated with that copy are expected,
      where n is the number of next-hop nodes reachable via that
      convergence layer in the delivery tree.)

   In all, the custodial state information that a non-custodial
   branching point node is required to maintain for each multicast

   bundle for which it is a branching point consists of:

      -an indication of whether or not the bundle was delivered at this
      node,

      -a list of the next-hop EIDs to which the bundle was forwarded
      (including the number of next-hop nodes associated with each EID
      for those next-hop EIDs that are reachable via multicast
      convergence layers)

      -a list of the next-hop nodes for which a corresponding
      "Succeeded" custody signal has been received, and

      -the endpoint ID that was in the current custodian field of the
      bundle when it was received.

      -the largest expiration time of all bundles associated with each
      next-hop EID (to ensure uniqueness when recovering custodian EID
      values to be used to distinguish among bundle copies).

   This custodial state information must be maintained for each branched
   bundle until the bundle expires or until the node itself sends a
   "Succeeded" custody signal for the bundle to the endpoint ID that was
   in the current custodian field of the bundle when it was received, at
   which time the information may be deleted.

   Note that even though the branching node is not becoming a true
   custodian for a given multicast bundle, it is inserting its own
   endpoint ID into the custodian field before forwarding the bundle, so
   that it may receive either a "Succeeded" or a "Failed" custody signal
   for each copy of the bundle that it forwards.  If a node that is not
   the custodian of the multicast bundle receives a "Succeeded" custody
   signal, this MUST be noted in the custodial state information for the
   bundle, relative to the next-hop branch from which the custody signal
   was received.

   The processing steps to be taken next may be determined by policy,
   which would be influenced by network stability characteristics and
   would involve the tradeoff between bandwidth conservation versus
   robustness of delivery.  In the absence of a policy to the contrary,
   custodial multicast is assumed to favor bandwidth conservation over
   robustness of delivery.  So by default, when a bundle is received,
   the node must consult its custodial state information to determine
   for which of the next-hop endpoints to which it should be forwarded,
   if any, the node has already received a "Succeeded" custody signal
   for the bundle.  If the bundle has already been delivered at this
   node and a "Succeeded" custody signal received back confirming this
   delivery, the bundle should not be delivered again.  Similarly, the



Symington, et al.       Expires November 3, 2008               [Page 29]

Internet-Draft     DTN Custodial Multicast Extensions           May 2008


   bundle should not be re-forwarded to any next-hop endpoints for which
   all expected "succeed" custody signals have already been received for
   this bundle, because the prior receipt of either of these signals
   indicates that at some previous time there were no longer any copies
   of the bundle downstream of that next-hop endpoint that needed to be
   either delivered or have their custody transferred.  If a policy to
   the contrary is in place that favors robustness of delivery over
   bandwidth conservation, then when a bundle is received, it should be
   forwarded out to all next-hop endpoints, even if it has previously
   been forwarded to some of those endpoints and "Succeeded" custody
   signals corresponding to one or more of those endpoints have been
   received back.

8.2.2.  Forwarding Contraindicated

   This section augments the Forwarding Contraindicated section of the
   Bundle Protocol [2].  It defines the procedures for handling a
   forwarding contraindication for a bundle whose destination is a
   multicast endpoint.

   As described in [8], there is a delay, which in a DTN could
   potentially be substantial, between when a node registers with a
   multicast EID and when that registration propagates fully throughout
   the network.  (Although [8] discusses this potentially substantial
   delay in terms of multicast EIDs, it exists relative to registration
   requests for singleton EIDs as well.)  Analogously, there may also be
   a substantial delay between when a node de-registers with a
   (multicast or singleton) EID and when that de-registration propagates
   fully throughout the network.  As a result, it might not be uncommon
   for a situation to arise in which a de-registration request has
   reached some nodes but not others such that a bundle could be
   forwarded by a custodian (which has not yet received notice of the
   de-registration request) and later received at some downstream node
   (which has received the de-registration request) that does not have
   any next-hop nodes to which the bundle should be forwarded (because
   the node that recently de-registered was the only node downstream of
   this node that had been in the multicast endpoint).  In this
   situation, forwarding of the bundle is determined to be
   contraindicated because of the "No known route to destination from
   here" reason listed in the Status Report Reason Codes of the Bundle
   Protocol specification [2].  According to the Bundle Protocol
   specification, the bundle protocol agent must determine whether or
   not to declare a failure in forwarding in this case.

   If the bundle protocol agent at which this situation occurs has
   recorded the fact that it recently received a deregistration request
   notification for the EID in question, it can distinguish this
   forwarding contraindication from a forwarding failure.  Instead of



Symington, et al.       Expires November 3, 2008               [Page 30]

Internet-Draft     DTN Custodial Multicast Extensions           May 2008


   declaring a forwarding failure, the bundle protocol agent should send
   a "Succeeded" custody signal for this multicast bundle.  A
   "Succeeded" custody signal indicates that there are no remaining
   copies of the bundle downstream of this node that need to be either
   delivered or taken custody of.  In order to be able to distinguish
   this type of forwarding contraindication from a forwarding error,
   bundle protocol agents should keep track of de-registration request
   notifications received in addition to registration request
   notifications received.

   If the bundle protocol agent at which this situation occurs is not
   recording the de-registration request notifications it receives, it
   will not be able to distinguish this situation in which forwarding is
   contraindicated because a downstream node has recently de-registered
   from the bundle's destination endpoint from a real forwarding
   failure.  Hence, it will declare a forwarding failure and will notify
   the custodian of the bundle of a custody transfer failure, possibly
   triggering a custodial retransmission of the bundle.

8.2.3.  Forwarding Failed

   This section augments the Forwarding Failed section of the Bundle
   Protocol [2].  It defines the procedures for handling forwarding
   failure for a bundle whose destination is a multicast endpoint.

   Procedures for handling failure of custody transfer for a custodial
   multicast bundle are the same as those for a singleton bundle: the
   bundle protocol agent MUST generate a "Failed" custody signal for the
   bundle, destined for the bundle's current custodian; the custody
   signal MUST contain a reason code corresponding to the reason for
   which forwarding was determined to be contraindicated.

8.2.4.  Bundle Reception

   This section augments the Bundle Reception section of the Bundle
   Protocol [2].  It defines the procedures for handling redundancy of
   custody transfer for a bundle whose destination is a multicast
   endpoint.

   step 1: When a custodial multicast bundle is received, if the bundle
   has the same source EID, creation timestamp, fragment offset and
   length (if any), and custodian EID as a bundle that the receiving
   node is currently custodian of, then by default the bundle's
   "Dispatch pending" retention constraint SHOULD be removed and the
   node SHOULD NOT send a "Succeeded" custody signal for this bundle.
   If the custodian EID of the received multicast bundle is different
   from that of the otherwise identical bundle of which the receiving
   node is currently custodian, however, then the bundle's "Dispatch

   pending" retention constraint MUST be removed and the node MUST send
   a "Suceeded" custody signal for this bundle.

8.2.5.  Local Bundle Delivery

   This section augments the Local Bundle Delivery section of the Bundle
   Protocol [2].  It defines the procedures for reporting custodial
   delivery for a bundle whose destination is a multicast endpoint.

   As soon as the bundle has been delivered, the bundle protocol agent
   must report custodial delivery for multicast bundles as it does for
   singleton bundles, namely, by generating a "Succeeded" custody signal
   for the bundle, destined for the bundle's current custodian.

8.2.6.  Custody Transfer

   This section augments the Custody Transfer section of the Bundle
   Protocol [2].  It defines the conditions under which a node may
   accept custody of a bundle whose destination is a multicast endpoint.

   As with singleton bundles, the decision as to whether or not to
   accept custody of a bundle is an implementation matter; however, if
   the bundle protocol agent has committed to accepting custody of the
   bundle as described in step 1 of section 4.2 ("Bundle Transmission")
   of the Bundle Protocol [2], then custody must be accepted.  If the
   bundle protocol agent elects to accept custody of the bundle, then it
   must follow the custody acceptance procedure defined in Section 8.2.7

8.2.7.  Custody Acceptance

   This section augments Custody Acceptance section of the Bundle
   Protocol [2].  It defines the procedures for acceptance of custody of
   a bundle whose destination is a multicast endpoint.

   The retention constraint "Custody Accepted" must be added to the
   bundle.

   If the "request custody acceptance reporting" flag in the bundle's
   class of service field is set to 1, this flag MAY be ignored.

   The bundle protocol agent must generate a "Succeeded" custody signal
   for the bundle, destined for the bundle's current custodian.

   The bundle protocol agent must assert the new current custodian for
   the bundle.  It does so by changing the current custodian endpoint ID
   in the bundle's primary block to the endpoint ID of one of the
   singleton endpoints in which the node is registered.

Internet-Draft     DTN Custodial Multicast Extensions           May 2008


   The bundle protocol agent must establish and maintain state
   information to keep track of each of the copies of this bundle that
   it is either delivering or forwarding, the EIDs to which they are
   being delivered or forwarded, the number of next-hop nodes expected
   to be reached at each EID, and whether or not a "Succeeded" custody
   signal has been received corresponding to each of these copies.

   The bundle protocol agent MAY set one custody transfer countdown
   timer per bundle or it MAY set one custody transfer countdown timer
   per one or more copies of this bundle that it is branching; upon
   expiration of one or more of these timers prior to expiration of the
   bundle itself and prior to custody transfer success for the
   associated copy (or copies) of the bundle, the custody transfer
   failure procedure must be followed for that copy (or those copies) of
   the bundle.  The manner in which the countdown interval for such
   timers is determined is an implementation matter.

   The bundle SHOULD be retained in persistent storage if possible.

8.2.8.  Custody Release

   This section augments the Custody Release section of the Bundle
   Protocol [2].  It defines the procedures for release of custody of a
   bundle whose destination is a multicast endpoint.

   As with singleton bundles, when custody of a multicast bundle is
   released, the "Custody accepted" retention constraint must be removed
   from the bundle and all custody transfer timers and other state
   information that have been established for this bundle must be
   destroyed.

8.2.9.  Custody Transfer Success

   This section augments the Custody Transfer Success section of the
   Bundle Protocol [2].  It defines the procedures for determining
   custody transfer success for a bundle whose destination is a
   multicast endpoint.

   Upon receipt of a "Succeeded" custody signal the receiving node MUST
   note in its custodial state information for this bundle the receipt
   of this signal in conjunction with the associated copy of the bundle
   that the node had branched, because the receipt of this signal means
   that there are no downstream copies of that copy of the bundle that
   still need to be either delivered or have their custody transferred.
   When a node has noted in its custodial state information for a given

   copy of that bundle that the node branched, meaning that there are no
   downstream copies of any copy of the bundle that remain to be

   delivered or taken custody of, then the node MUST check its custodial
   state information for the referenced bundle to determine whether it
   is in fact the "real" custodian for that bundle or whether it is just
   a proxy custodian.

   If the node is the real custodian of the bundle then custody of the
   bundle must be released as described in Section 8.2.8.

   If the node is a proxy custodian of the bundle, then the node MUST
   generate a "Succeeded" custody signal for the bundle, destined for
   the node that it had noted in its custodial state information as
   being the bundle's current custodian when the bundle was received.
   It MAY destroy all custodial state information for the bundle.  (The
   node may want to retain this custodial state information until the
   bundle expires so that if the node receives the bundle again it will
   know exactly to which next-hop nodes it was forwarded, assuming this
   information is useful for efficiently transmitting bundles to late-
   joining nodes.)

8.2.10.  Custody Transfer Failure

   This section augments the Custody Transfer Failure section of the
   Bundle Protocol [2].  It defines the procedures for determining
   custody transfer failure for a copy of a bundle whose destination is
   a multicast endpoint.

   Custody transfer for a multicast bundle copy is determined to have
   failed at a custodial node when either (a) that node's custody
   transfer timer that is associated with that copy of the bundle (if
   any) expires or (b) a "Failed" custody signal for the bundle copy is
   received at that node.  Only custodial nodes have custody transfer
   timers for bundles; non-custodial branching nodes do not.  Both non-
   custodial branching nodes and custodial nodes, however, may receive
   "Failed" custody signals.

   Upon receipt of a "Failed" custody signal, the receiving node must
   check its custodial state information for the referenced bundle copy
   to determine whether or not it is in fact the "real" custodian for
   that bundle copy or whether it is just a proxy custodian for that
   bundle copy.

   If the receiving node is a proxy custodian of the bundle, then it
   must start a signal aggregation timer for this bundle if one has not
   already been started.

      If it has not already done so, the receiving node must generate a
      new bundle.  The receiving node's own EID must be inserted as the
      new bundle's source, and the EID of the node that the receiving

      node had noted in its custodial state information as being the
      referenced bundle's current custodian when the bundle was received
      must be inserted as the new bundle's destination.  The "Failed"
      custody signal administration record must be inserted as this new
      bundle's payload.

      If the bundle that contained the "Failed" custody signal that was
      received also included a Proxy EID extension block, this extension
      block must be included in the new bundle that is generated.  If
      the bundle that contained the "Failed" custody signal that was
      received did not include a Proxy EID extension block, then the
      node must insert a Proxy EID extension block into the new bundle
      that is generated.  In either case, the node must insert a
      custodial signal information record into the Proxy EID extension
      block of the new bundle that is generated.

      The procedures for inserting a custodial information record into a
      proxy EID extension block are as follows:

         -The value inserted into the Status field of the custodial
         signal information record must be the value of the status field
         of the "Failed" custody signal that was just received.

         -The value inserted into the Time of Signal field of the
         custodial signal information record must be the value of the
         Time of signal field of the "Failed" custody signal that was
         just received.

         -Strings for the Scheme and SSP of the source EID of the bundle
         containing the "Failed" custody signal that was just received
         must be inserted into the dictionary of the bundle containing
         the proxy EID extension block (if not already there).

         -Offsets to the above EID reference pair must be inserted into
         the EID references field of the Proxy EID extension block
         following all other such EID references that are in this block,
         and the EID references count must be incremented by one.

      If, on the other hand, the receiving node had already generated a
      new bundle, it must insert a custodial signal information record
      into the Proxy EID extension block of this new bundle using the
      procedures defined above.

   When the signal aggregation timer for this bundle expires or when
   custody signals corresponding to all copies of the bundle that were
   branched at this node are received (whichever comes first), the node
   must forward the new bundle.  Note that this new bundle contains a
   "Failed" custody signal that refers to a specific bundle and it is



Symington, et al.       Expires November 3, 2008               [Page 35]

   destined for the upstream node that had been noted as being the
   current custodian of the referenced bundle when the bundle was
   received.  This new bundle that is forwarded will contain a Proxy EID
   extension block with one or more custody signal information records,
   each of which corresponds to the origination of a "Failed" custody
   signal for a different downstream copy of this bundle by the
   downstream nodes indicated in the EID references field.

   If the receiving node is the real custodian of the bundle copy then,
   as noted above, custody transfer of the referenced bundle copy is
   determined to have failed.  If the "Failed" custody signal contains a
   Proxy EID extension block, then the EID of the node(s) that
   originally generated the "Failed" custody signal(s) is/are identified
   in the EID references field of the Proxy EID extension block;
   otherwise, the EID of the node that originated the custody signal is
   identified in the Source EID field of the bundle containing the
   "Failed" custody signal.

   Upon determination of a custody transfer failure for a particular
   multicast bundle copy, the action taken by the custodian depends on
   the nature of the failure:

      -If custody transfer failure is inferred from expiration of a
      custody transfer timer or is asserted by a "Failed" custody signal
      with the "Depleted storage", "No timely contact with next node on
      route", or "Bundle Forwarded Non-Custodially" reason code, the
      bundle protocol agent SHOULD retransmit the bundle.  It may re-
      forward the bundle to all next hop nodes appropriate for reaching
      nodes in the multicast endpoint, it may re-forward the bundle only
      to the next hop node(s) to which the copy of the bundle referenced
      in the "Failed" custody signal or associated with the expired
      timer had been forwarded, or it may encapsulate the multicast
      bundle in a singleton bundle for bandwidth-efficient transmission
      to the node that originally generated the "Failed" custody signal
      if a "Failed" custody signal had been received (See [3]).

      -If custody transfer failure is asserted by a "Failed" custody
      signal with the "Redundant Reception", "Destination EID
      unintelligible", "Block unintelligible", or "No known route to
      destination from here" reason code, the node SHOULD NOT retransmit
      the bundle.

8.2.11.  Bundle Deletion

   This section augments the Bundle Deletion section of the Bundle
   Protocol [2].  It defines the steps in deleting a custodial bundle
   whose destination is a multicast endpoint.

   If the retention constraint "Custody accepted" currently prevents
   this bundle from being discarded, then:

      -Custody of the node is released as described in Section 8.2.8

      -A bundle deletion status report citing the reason for deletion
      must be generated, destined for the bundle's report-to-endpoint
      ID.

   All custodial state information being stored for this bundle MUST be
   destroyed.

8.3.  Reception of Custody Signals

   This section augments section 5.3 of the Bundle Protocol [2].  It
   defines the procedures that must be followed when custody signals for
   multicast bundles are received.

   For each received custody signal for a multicast bundle that has the
   Custody Transfer Succeeded flag set to 1, the administrative element
   of the application agent must direct the bundle protocol agent to
   follow the custody transfer success procedure in Section 8.2.9.

   For each received custody signal for a multicast bundle that has the
   Custody Transfer Succeeded flag set to 0, the administrative element
   of the application agent must direct the bundle protocol agent to
   follow the custody transfer failure procedure in Section 8.2.10.

9.  Custodial Multicast and the Retransmission Block

   Use of the DTN Retransmission Block [5] to identify bundles that are
   custodial retransmissions so as to distinguish them from replays is
   optional.  If a node receives a bundle that

      -has a multicast destination endpoint,

      -has its "custody transfer requested" Bundle Processing Flag set,
      and

      -includes a retransmission block

   then if that node will not become a custodian of the bundle but it
   will serve as a non-custodial branching point, then in addition to
   changing the current custodian endpoint ID in the bundle's primary
   block to the endpoint ID of one of the singleton endpoints in which
   the node is registered (as described in Bundle Forwarding
   Section 8.2.1), the node must also change the EID reference field in
   the Retransmission Block to refer to this same singleton EID in which
   the node is registered.  Hence, both the custodian field and the
   Retransmission Block will refer to a singleton EID that identifies
   the Proxy Custodian rather than one that identifies the "real"
   custodian.

10.  Performance Impact

   The mechanisms defined in this document attempt to conserve network
   bandwidth and minimize the complexity of enhancements to the Bundle
   Protocol.  They increase the amount of state that will need to be
   maintained at those bundle nodes that support these mechanisms.

   The amount of state that a given custodial node or non-custodial
   branching node may have to maintain is potentially large.  A node may
   not have sufficient storage space to store this state information for
   each bundle until the bundle expires. if a node runs out of room and
   cannot keep track of for which bundle copies it has received
   "Succeeded" custody signals and for which it has not, then if the
   node receives a retransmitted bundle, it will have to re-forward the
   bundle along all downstream branches of the delivery tree.  This is
   not incorrect; just inefficient.  Nodes should be provided with a
   default algorithm for defining how long state information must be
   maintained and, if they run out of room for state information, for
   determining which state information gets deleted and which gets
   saved.

11.  Security Considerations

   Although there are two documents that pertain to providing security
   within DTN [4], [7], both of these documents address the security of
   the Bundle Protocol when used to transmit bundles from a single
   source to a single destination.  They do not address the security of
   multicast delivery within the bundle protocol.  Therefore, how to
   extend the Bundle Security Protocol to provide end-to-end protection
   for bundles that are sent from a single source to multiple
   destinations is yet to be determined.  The use of the Bundle
   Authentication Block (BAB) to provide hop-by-hop security protections
   for bundles is expected to remain largely unchanged when applied
   protecting multicast delivery.  The Confidentiality Block (CB) and
   the Payload Security Block (PSB), however, because they provide end-
   to-end security, would be expected to require adaptation to provide
   protection between a single source at one end of the transmission and
   multiple destinations at the other end.

   This document does not consider the security aspects of enabling or
   preventing a node from registering or de-registering with a
   particular multicast endpoint ID, and thereby joining and leaving a
   particular multicast group, although we acknowledge that security
   considerations regarding joining and leaving groups are present and
   significant.

12.  IANA Considerations

   None at this time.  If the bundle protocol becomes a standards track
   protocol, then we may want to consider having IANA establish a
   register of block types.
