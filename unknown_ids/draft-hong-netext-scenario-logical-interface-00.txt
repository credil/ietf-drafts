Abstract

   A logical interface is used to hide the change of network interface
   from the upper host IP layer and it also can be used for a multiple
   interfaces mobile node in PMIPv6 domain.  If a LMA assigns multiple
   home network prefixes to a multiple interfaces mobile node with a
   logical interface, a logical interface has various usages of the
   multiple home network prefixes.  As following general PMIPv6
   operations described in RFC 5213, all multiple home network prefixes
   are shown to host IP layer.  Also, the logical interface hides the
   existence of multiple home network prefixes and shows only one home
   network prefix to host IP layer.  In this internet draft, we describe
   various scenarios of the usage of multiple home network prefixes on a
   logical interface.

Internet-Draft    Scenarios of HNP on Logical interface        July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)[RFC5213] is a network based IP mobility
   support protocol, which does not require any modifications to mobile
   nodes.  PMIPv6 makes it possible to support mobility for IPv6 nodes
   without an involvement of mobile nodes.  That is, on behalf of mobile
   nodes, a mobile access gateway (MAG) in the network performs the
   signaling for mobility management with a local mobility anchor (LMA).

   Due to the simultaneous usage of multiple interfaces in a mobile node
   and the change of network interfaces, IETF netext working group has
   studied the hiding access technology changes from host IP layer.
   Link layer implementation such as "logical interface" can hide the
   actually used physical interfaces and the change of physical
   interfaces from the IP layer.  Many operating systems offer support
   to the usage of logical interface over multiple physical interfaces
   without any big efforts.  In another internet draft
   [I-D.melia-netext-logical-interface-support-00], operations details
   of the logical interface are explained and it identifies the
   applicability of the usage of logical interface.

   PMIPv6 specification allow mobile nodes to connect PMIPv6 domain
   through multiple network interfaces for simultaneous access and a LMA
   may allocate more than one home network prefix for a given interface
   of the mobile node.  In basic PMIPv6 specification, the multiple home
   network prefixes that the LMA allocates to a mobile node are shown
   totally to the host IP stack of the mobile node.  But, if a mobile
   node utilizes a logical interface to hide the change of network
   interfaces, we can extend the usage of multiple home network
   prefixes.  First, as following general PMIPv6 operations described in
   RFC 5213, all multiple home network prefixes are shown to host IP
   layer.  Second, for some reasons such as the session continuity, only
   one home network prefix is shown to the host IP stack of the mobile
   node even though the LMA allocates multiple home network prefixes.
   In this case, the logical interface does some necessary jobs to hide
   the existence of multiple interfaces and also the existence of
   multiple home network prefixes.  And the logical interface does some
   necessary jobs when network interfaces are changed and/or home
   network prefixes are changed.

3.  Multihoming support on a logical interface in PMIPv6

   In PMIPv6 specification, to provide multihoming support, it describes
   three key aspects as following.

   o  When a mobile node connects to a PMIPv6 domain through multiple
      interfaces for simultaneous access, the LMA MUST allocate a
      mobility session for each of the attached interfaces.

   o  The LMA MAY allocate more than one home network prefix for a given
      interface of the mobile node.

   o  The LMA MUST allow for a handoff between two different interfaces
      of a mobile node.  In such a scenario, all the home network
      prefixes associated with one interface (part of one mobility
      session) will be associated with a different interface of the
      mobile node.

   Even though a logical interface is adopted in a multiple interface
   mobile node in PMIPv6 domain, the above three aspects SHOULD be
   applied.

   For the regarding of first aspect, if a logical interface is used,
   even though multiple network interfaces are used in a mobile node,
   only one logical interface is shown to both host IP stack of the
   mobile node and the LMA.  So, in this case, the LMA allocates a
   mobility session for the logical interface of a mobile node and one
   mobility session of the logical interface is generated.

   For the regarding of second aspect, in basic PMIPv6 specification, if
   a LMA allocates multiple home network prefixes to a multiple
   interfaces mobile node, these multiple home network prefixes are
   totally shown to the host IP stack of the mobile node.  This is
   effective when a logical interface is used.  But, due to the usage of
   a logical interface in a mobile node in PMIPv6 domain, we can extend
   the allocation method of multiple home network prefixes to a mobile
   node.  As same as the role of a logical interface to hide the change
   of multiple interfaces, the logical interface can hide the existence
   and the change of multiple home network prefixes.  In the next
   section, we describe more detail.

   For the regarding of third aspect, this description is no longer
   effective because only one logical interface is shown to the LMA and
   the LMA assumes that the mobile node has one interface even though it
   has multiple interfaces.  But, the PMPv6 specification SHOULD be
   extended to consider a handoff between two different physical
   interfaces of a mobile node with a logical interface.

4.  The usage of multiple home network prefixes on a logical interface

4.1.  Scenario 1 - All home network prefixes are shown to IP host stack

   The fist scenario of the usage of multiple home network prefixes on a
   logical interface is same as described in internet draft of "Logical
   Interface Support for multi-mode IP Hosts
   [I-D.melia-netext-logical-interface-support-00]."  The role of a
   logical interface is only to hide the existence of multiple network
   interfaces and the change of network interfaces.  The home network
   prefixes that a LMA allocates to a multiple interface mobile node are
   totally shown to host IP stack of the mobile node.  The logical
   interface simply bypass the home network prefixes between host IP
   stack and physical interfaces.

   Figure 1 shows this case.  As shown in Figure 1, if the LMA allocates
   two home network prefixes HNP-1, HNP-2 to the mobile node, these two
   home network prefixes are shown to IP host stack of the mobile node.
   As a result of receiving multiple home network prefixes in IP host
   stack, two different IPv6 addresses HNP-1::zzz/128 and HNP-2::zzz/128
   are generated.

4.2.  Scenario 2 - Only one home network prefix is shown to IP host
      stack

   In above scenario 1, basic PMIPv6 operations can be applied even
   though a logical interface is used.  Multihoming support and inter-
   technology handoff support is provided without any modification of
   PMIPv6 operations but for flow mobility, it needs method to transfer
   a subset of multiple home network prefixes.

   In scenario 1, one application that uses one specific home network
   prefix cannot utilize the multiplicity of home network prefixes.  For
   on-going session continuity, applications cannot change their home
   network prefix during packet sending/receiving.  Even though a
   logical interface supports the inter-technology handoff between
   different network interfaces, applications should use same home

   network prefix before/after handoff.

   But, if a logical interface supports the change of network interface
   and also the change of home network prefix, applications can utilize
   the multiplicity of home network prefixes.  As a same manner of the
   handling of network interface, only one home network prefix is shown
   to host IP stack of the mobile node.  And the logical interface
   manages the relation between multiple home network prefixes and the
   home network prefix that is shown to host IP stack and dynamically
   update them.  In this case, only one logical interface and one home
   network prefix is shown to host IP stack of the mobile node.

   Figure 2 shows this case.  As shown in Figure 2, if the LMA allocates
   two home network prefixes HNP-1, HNP-2 to the mobile node, only one
   home network prefix is shown to IP host stack of the mobile node.  As
   a result of receiving single home network prefix in IP host stack,
   one IPv6 addresses HNP-1::zzz/128 is generated.
