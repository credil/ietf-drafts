Abstract

   This draft specifies OAM messages to indicate service disruptive
   conditions for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs).  The notification mechanism employs a generic method for a
   service disruptive condition to be communicated to a Maintenance End
   Point (MEP).  An MPLS Operation, Administration, and Maintenance
   (OAM) channel is defined along with messages to communicate various
   types of service disruptive conditions.

Internet-Draft          MPLS Fault Management OAM             March 2010


1.  Introduction

   In traditional transport networks, circuits such as T1 lines are
   provisioned on multiple switches.  When a disruption occurs on any
   link or node along the path of such a transport circuit, alarms are
   generated which may in turn suppress alarms and/or activate a backup
   circuit.  The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) provides mechanisms to
   emulate traditional transport circuits.  Therefore a Fault Management
   (FM) capability must be defined for MPLS.  This capability is being
   defined to meet the MPLS-TP requirements as defined in RFC 5654 [1],
   and the MPLS-TP Operations, Administration and Maintenance
   Requirements as defined in draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements [2].
   However, this mechanism is intended to be applicable to other aspects
   of MPLS as well.

   Three broad classes service disruptive conditions are identified.

   1.  Defect: the situation in which the density of anomalies has
       reached a level where the ability to perform a required function
       has been interrupted.

   2.  Fault: the inability of a function to perform a required action.
       This does not include an inability due to preventive maintenance,
       lack of external resources, or planned actions (e.g.,
       Administrative Locking).  A fault is a persistent defect.

   3.  Lock: an administrative status in which it is expected that only
       test traffic, if any, and OAM (dedicated to the LSP) can be
       mapped on an LSP.

   This document specifies an MPLS OAM channel called an "MPLS-OAM Fault
   Management (FM)" channel.  A single message format and a set of
   procedures are defined to communicate service disruptive conditions
   from the location where they occur to the endpoints of LSPs which are
   affected by those conditions.  Multiple message types are used to
   indicate the particular condition.

   Corresponding to the three classes of service disruptive conditions
   listed above, three messages are defined to communicate the type of
   condition.  These are known as:

      Alarm Indication Signal (AIS)

      Link Down Indication (LDI)

      Locked Report (LKR)

2.  MPLS Fault Management Messages

   This document defines messages to indicate three types of service

Internet-Draft          MPLS Fault Management OAM             March 2010


   disruptive conditions, Alarm Indication Signal, Link Down Indication,
   and Locked Report.  These semantics of the individual messages are
   described in subsections below.  Although only one of the conditions
   is named "Fault", we use the term "Fault Management" to generically
   mean management of all three conditions.

   Fault Management messages are carried in-band by using the Associated
   Channel Header (ACH) and Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) as
   defined in RFC5586 [4].  To facilitate recognition and delivery of
   Fault Management messages, the Fault Management Channel is identified
   by a unique codepoint.

   When a server MEP detects a service disruptive condition, Fault
   Management messages are generated by the convergence server-to-client
   adaptation function.  The messages are sent to the client MEPs by
   inserting them into the affected LSPs in the direction opposite to
   the detecting MEP's peer server MEP(s).  The message is sent
   periodically until the condition is cleared.

2.1.  MPLS-TP Alarm Indication Signal

   The MPLS-TP Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) message is generated in
   response to detecting defects in the server layer.  The AIS message
   SHOULD be sent as soon is the condition is detected, that is before
   any determination has been made as to whether the condition is fatal.
   For example an AIS message may be sent during a protection switching
   event and would cease being sent if the protection switch was
   successful in restoring the link.

   Its primary purpose is to suppress alarms in the MPLS-TP layer
   network above the level at which the defect occurs.  The AIS message
   MAY be used to trigger recovery mechanisms.  It should be noted that
   such use would be subject to false positives, e.g. unnecessary
   protection switching events in the client layer.

2.2.  MPLS-TP Link Down Indication

   The LDI message is generated in response to detecting a fatal failure
   in the server layer.  The LDI message MUST NOT be sent until the
   defect has been determined to be fatal.  For example during a
   protection switching event LDI messages are not sent.  However if the
   protection switch was unsuccessful in restoring the link within the
   expected repair time, an LDI message MUST be sent.

   The receipt of an LDI message MAY be treated as the equivalent of
   loss of continuity at the client layer.  Like AIS it also is used to
   suppress alarms.

Internet-Draft          MPLS Fault Management OAM             March 2010


2.3.  The Relationship of AIS to LDI

   AIS and LDI are closely related functions and also related to the
   rate at which the Continuity Check (CC) function is running.  In a
   normal transport environment, CC is run at a high rate in order to
   detect a failure within 10s of milliseconds.  In such an environment,
   AIS and LDI should be treated the same and used solely for alarm
   suppression.  In more general MPLS environments the CC function may
   be running at a much slower rate.  In this environment, LDI enables
   faster switch-over upon a failure occurring along the LSP.

2.4.  MPLS-TP Locked Report

   The MPLS-TP Locked Report (LKR) message is generated when a server
   layer entity has been administratively locked to communicated that
   condition to inform the client layer entities of that condition.
   When an MPLS-TP LSP is administratively locked it is not available to
   carry client traffic.  Its purpose is to suppress alarms in the
   MPLS-TP layer network above the level at which the defect occurs and
   to allow the clients to differentiate the lock condition from a
   defect condition.

   The receipt of an LKR message MAY be treated as the equivalent of
   loss of continuity at the client layer.  Like AIS it also is used to
   suppress alarms.


3.  MPLS Fault Management Channel

   The MPLS Fault Management channel is identified by the ACH as defined
   in RFC 5586 [4] with the Channel Type set to the MPLS Fault
   Management (FM) code point = 0xHH.  [HH to be assigned by IANA from
   the PW Associated Channel Type registry.]  The FM Channel uses ACH
   TLVs and MUST include the ACH TLV header.  The FM ACH Channel and ACH
   TLVs are shown below.

      R-flag

         The R-flag is normally set to zero.  A setting of one indicates
         the removal of a previously sent FM condition.

   Message Type

      The Message Type indicates the type of condition as listed in the
      table below.

      Msg Type           Description
      --------           -----------------------------
        0x0              Reserved
        0x1              Alarm Indication Signal (AIS)
        0x2              Link Down Indication (LDI)
        0x3              Locked Report (LKR)

   Refresh Timer

      The maximum time between successive FM messages specified in
      seconds.  The range is 1 to 65535.  The value 0 is not permitted.

   Total TLV Length

      The total TLV length is the total of all included TLVs.  At this
      time no TLVs are defined.


5.  Sending and Receiving Fault Management Messages

5.1.  Sending a Fault Management Message

   Service disruptive conditions are indicated by sending FM messages.
   The message type is set to the value corresponding to the condition.
   The refresh timer is set to the maximum time between successive FM
   messages.  This value MUST not be changed on successive FM messages.
   If the optional clearing procedures are not used, then the default
   value is 1.  Otherwise the default value is 20.

   The message is then prepended with an ACH TLV header.  A Global-ID
   TLV or an ICC TLV MAY be included.  The IF_ID TLV SHOULD be included.
   If the R-Flag clearing procedures are to be used, the IF_ID TLV MUST
   be included.

   The message is then sent.  The message MUST be refreshed twice at an
   interval of one second.  Further refreshes are sent according to the
   value of the refresh timer.  Refreshing continues until the condition
   is cleared.

Internet-Draft          MPLS Fault Management OAM             March 2010


5.2.  Clearing a FM Indication

   Ceasing to send FM messages will clear the indication after 3.5 times
   the Refresh Timer.  To clear an indication more quickly, the
   following procedure is used.  The R-Flag of the FM message is set to
   one.  Other fields of the FM message SHOULD NOT be modified.  The
   message is sent immediately and then refreshed twice at an interval
   of one second.

5.3.  Receiving a FM Indication

   When a FM message is received, a MEP examines it to ensure that that
   it is well formed.  If the message type is unknown, the message is
   ignored.  If the R-Flag is zero, the condition corresponding to the
   message type is entered.  A timer is set to 3.5 times the refresh
   timer.  If the message is not refreshed within this period, the
   condition is cleared.  A message is considered a refresh if the
   message type and IF_ID match an existing condition and the R-Flag is
   set to zero.

   If the R-Flag is set to one, the MEP checks to see if a condition
   matching the message type and IF_ID exists.  If it does, that
   condition is cleared.  Otherwise the message is ignored.


6.  Security Considerations

   Spurious fault OAM messages form a vector for a denial of service
   attack.  However, since these messages are carried in a control
   channel, one would have to gain access to a node providing the
   service in order to effect such an attack.  Since transport networks
   are usually operated as a walled garden, such threats are less
   likely.  However, to ensure against such an attack the Authentication
   TLV MAY be included among the ACH TLVs.
