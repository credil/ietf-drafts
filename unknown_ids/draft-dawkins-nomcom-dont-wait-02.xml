<abstract>
	<t>This document updates RFC 3777, Section 4, Bullet 13 to allow announcement of open positions 
		and solicitation of volunteers to be issued before a Nominating and Recall Committee 
		Chair has been named by the Internet Society President.
	</t>
</abstract>
</front>

<middle>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

	<t>The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), 
		and at-large IETF representatives to the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) are 
		selected by a "Nominating and Recall Committee" (universally abbreviated as "NomCom").
		<xref target='RFC3777' /> defines how the NomCom is selected, and the processes it follows as
		it selects candidates for these positions.
	</t>

	<t>This document describes an issue with <xref target='RFC3777' /> that causes an avoidable delay
		in the NomCom process, and specifies a normative update to resolve the issue.
	</t>

</section>

<section anchor="background" title="Background of this document" >

	<t><xref target='RFC3777' /> is the latest in a series of revisions to the NomCom process. 
		<xref target='RFC3777' /> has been updated once since 2004,
		but this update (<xref target='RFC5078' /> did not change normative text (it replaced a
		sample timeline).
	</t>

	<t><xref target='RFC5078' /> identified a serial delay in the process described in 
		<xref target='RFC3777' />, in section 4, 
		"Nominating Committee Selection", bullet 13, which states:
	</t>

	<t><list>
		<t>The Chair obtains the list of IESG and IAB positions to be
       			reviewed and announces it along with a solicitation for names of
       			volunteers from the IETF community willing to serve on the
       			nominating committee.
		</t>
		
		<t>The solicitation must permit the community at least 30 days
       			during which they may choose to volunteer to be selected for the
      			nominating committee.
		</t>
	
		<t>The list of open positions is published with the solicitation to
  			facilitate community members choosing between volunteering for an
   			open position and volunteering for the nominating committee.
		</t>
	</list></t>

	<t>The result is that the Incoming NomCom 
		Chair is the only person who can announce the list of open positions 
		and solicitation for names
		of volunteers, a process that requires 30 days for public solicitation.

	</t>
	
	<t>Since this is the first step in 
		organizing the NomCom committee, delays in selecting the Incoming NomCom Chair translate 
		directly into delays in issuing the solicitation and organizing the NomCom.
	</t>

	<t>This proved problematic in practice in 2008-2009, when Joel Halpern was named NomCom Chair less 
		than 30 days prior to the Second IETF meeting. If the 30-day solicitation had already taken 
		place, the Nomcom could have conducted face-to-face interviews at the Second IETF
		meeting, but since the required 30-day solicitation didn't start until Joel 
		was named, 
		Joel was unable to assemble his NomCom before the Second IETF meeting, 
		and the NomCom had to carry out these interviews using e-mail and conference calls.
	</t>

	<t>It is desirable to allow the solicitation and announcement to take place in a timely manner 
		so that when 
		an Incoming NomCom Chair IS named, the NomCom Chair can immediately begin executing the
		NomCom process.
	</t>

</section>

<section anchor="discussion" title="Discussion" >

	<t>This document proposes that the IETF Secretariat
		will issue the announcement of open positions and the solicitation for
		names of volunteers on behalf of the Incoming NomCom Chair who will be named by the ISOC
		President. This allows the 
		search for the Incoming NomCom Chair and volunteers to proceed in parallel.
	</t>

	<t>This process change covers only the the announcement of open positions and solicitation for names
		of volunteers. The goal of this process change is 
		*not* to allow the NomCom process to move to completion without an Incoming NomCom Chair, 
		it is only to ensure that the Incoming NomCom Chair can begin
		executing the NomCom process without an avoidable delay, and can use face-to-face time at 
		the Second IETF meeting effectively for this purpose.
	</t>

	<t>During discussions in the IETF 74 timeframe, it was suggested that we also allow the secretariat
		to perform other clerical tasks that aren't called out specifically in the NomCom 
		process, but which clearly do not require NomCom chair judgement. This document does
		not provide guidance about specific clerical tasks that would be appropriate for the 
		secretariat to 
		carry out. Instead, either the Incoming NomCom Chair (if one has been selected)
		or the Outgoing NomCom Chair (if the search for an Incoming NomCom Chair is still underway)
		may request the secretariat to perform these tasks, with appropriate notification to the 
		community.
	</t>

</section>

<section anchor="updatedtext" title="Updated text from RFC 3777">

	<t>For <xref target='RFC3777' />, in section 4, 
		"Nominating Committee Selection", bullet 13, which states:
	</t>

	<t><list>
		<t>The Chair obtains the list of IESG and IAB positions to be
       			reviewed and announces it along with a solicitation for names of
       			volunteers from the IETF community willing to serve on the
       			nominating committee.
		</t>
		
	</list></t>

	<t>this text is replaced with the following text:
	</t>

	<t><list>
		<t>The IETF Secretariat obtains the list of positions to be
       			reviewed and announces it along with a solicitation for names of
       			volunteers from the IETF community willing to serve on the
       			nominating committee.
		</t>

		<t>At the NomCom Chair's request, the secretariat may perform other clerical
			support tasks, as long as the task being performed does not require NomCom Chair
			judgement, in the NomCom Chair's opinion, and as long as 
			the community is appropriately notified
			that this request is being made. This request may come from the Incoming
			NomCom Chair (if one has been selected for this NomCom cycle) or the Outgoing
			NomCom Chair (if the search for an Incoming NomCom Chair is still underway).
		</t>
		
	</list></t>

	<t>Note: This text no longer specifies the list of bodies that NomCom reviews, rather than adding
		IAOC to the list of bodies in the text, so that this text need not change further when 
		NomCom review responsibilities change.
	</t>

</section>


<section anchor="nexttime" title="Possible Topics for Later Discussion">

	<t>This section includes topics that came up during discussion of this document,
		which were not included in the normative changes contained in this document,
		because the goal for this document was incremental improvement, and these topics
		were more than incremental changes.
		They may be discussed further, or not, but we're less likely to forget them
		completely if we write them down.
	</t>

	<t><xref target='RFC3777' /> tightly couples the announcement of open positions and 
		call for volunteers, and this document didn't try to unravel these two separate
		actions. We had a request during discussion to separate them, so that a NomCom
		could consider the management structure of the IETF and the position descriptions
		that the leadership bodies provide, before announcing the positions being reviewed.
	</t>

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
	<t>This specification describes issues with the current IETF Nominating Committee process 
		(<xref target='RFC3777' />) and proposes an update to avoid a serial delay.
		No security considerations apply.
