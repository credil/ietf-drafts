           Use of the Content-Disposition Header Field in the
                   Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
                    draft-reschke-rfc2183-in-http-01

Abstract

   HTTP/1.1 defines the Content-Disposition response header field, but
   points out that it is not part of the HTTP/1.1 Standard.  This
   specification takes over the definition and registration of Content-
   Disposition, as used in HTTP, and clarifies internationalization
   considerations.

Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor before publication)

   This specification is expected to replace the definition of Content-
   Disposition in the HTTP/1.1 specification, as currently revised by
   the IETF HTTPbis working group.  See also
   <http://www3.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/ticket/123>.

Internet-Draft         Content-Disposition in HTTP             July 2010


1.  Introduction

   HTTP/1.1 defines the Content-Disposition response header field in
   Section 19.5.1 of [RFC2616], but points out that it is not part of
   the HTTP/1.1 Standard (Section 15.5):

      Content-Disposition is not part of the HTTP standard, but since it
      is widely implemented, we are documenting its use and risks for
      implementors.

   This specification takes over the definition and registration of
   Content-Disposition, as used in HTTP.  Based on interoperability
   testing with existing User Agents, it defines a profile of the
   features defined in the MIME variant ([RFC2183]) of the header field,
   and also clarifies internationalization considerations.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification uses the augmented BNF notation defined in Section
   2.1 of [RFC2616], including its rules for linear whitespace (LWS).


3.  Header Field Definitions

3.1.  Grammar

     content-disposition = "Content-Disposition" ":"
                            disposition-type *( ";" disposition-parm )

     disposition-type    = "inline" | "attachment" | disp-ext-type
                         ; case-insensitive
     disp-ext-type       = token

     disposition-parm    = filename-parm | disp-ext-parm

     filename-parm       = "filename" "=" value
                         | "filename*" "=" ext-value

     disp-ext-parm       = token "=" value
                         | ext-token "=" ext-value
     ext-token           = <the characters in token, followed by "*">

Internet-Draft         Content-Disposition in HTTP             July 2010


   Defined in [RFC2616]:

     token       = <token, defined in [RFC2616], Section 2.2>
     value       = <value, defined in [RFC2616], Section 3.6>

   Defined in [draft-reschke-rfc2231-in-http]:

  ext-value   = <ext-value, defined in [draft-reschke-rfc2231-in-http], Section 3.2>

3.2.  Disposition Type

   If the disposition type matches "attachment" (case-insensitively),
   the implied suggestion is that the user agent should not display the
   response, but directly enter a "save response as..." dialog.

   On the other hand, if it matches "inline", this implies regular
   processing.  Note that this type may be used when it is desirable to
   transport filename information for the case of a subsequent, user-
   initiated, save operation.

   Other disposition types SHOULD be handled the same way as
   "attachment" ([RFC2183], Section 2.8).

3.3.  Disposition Parameter: 'Filename'

   [[anchor3: Talk about expected behavior, mention security
   considerations.]]

3.4.  Disposition Parameter: Extensions

   Parameters other than "filename" SHOULD be ignored ([RFC2183],
   Section 2.8).


4.  Examples

   Direct UA to show "save as" dialog, with a filename of "foo.html":

   Content-Disposition: Attachment; filename=foo.html

   Direct UA to behave as if the Content-Disposition header field wasn't
   present, but to remember the filename "foo.html" for a subsequent
   save operation:

   Content-Disposition: INLINE; FILENAME= "foo.html"

5.  Security Considerations

   [[csec: Both refer to 2183, and also mention: long filenames, dot and
   dotdot, absolute paths, mismatches between media type and extension]]


6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Registry for Disposition Values and Parameter

   This specification does not introduce any changes to the registration
   procedures for disposition values and parameters that are defined in
   Section 9 of [RFC2183].

6.2.  Header Field Registration

   This document updates the definition of the Content-Disposition HTTP
   header field in the permanent HTTP header field registry (see
   [RFC3864]).

   Header field name:  Content-Disposition

Appendix A.  Changes from the RFC 2616 Definition

   Compared to Section 19.5.1 of [RFC2616], the following normative
   changes reflecting actual implementations have been made:

   o  According to RFC 2616, the disposition type "attachment" only
      applies to content of type "application/octet-stream".  This
      restriction has been removed, because user agents in practice do
      not check the content type, and it also discourages properly
      declaring the media type.

   o  The definition for the disposition type "inline" ([RFC2183],
      Section 2.1) has been re-added with a suggestion for its
      processing.

   o  This specification requires support for the extended parameter
      encoding defined in [draft-reschke-rfc2231-in-http].


Appendix B.  Differences compared to RFC 2183

   Section 2 of [RFC2183] defines several additional disposition
   parameters: "creation-date", "modification-date", "quoted-date-time",
   and "size".  These do not appear to be implemented by any user agent,
   thus have been ommitted from this specification.
