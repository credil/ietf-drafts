   specifications and other documents.  This document describes the use
   of these blocks.


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the IPv4 address blocks that are provided for
   use in documentation.  The use of designated address ranges for
   documentation and examples reduces the likelihood of conflicts and
   confusion arising from the use of addresses assigned for some other
   purpose.

   [RFC1166] reserves the first of the three address blocks,
   192.0.2.0/24.  The other two address blocks have recently been
   allocated for this purpose, to ease the writing of examples involving
   addresses from multiple networks.

   These addresses are complementary to other documentation ranges
   defined in the IETF, including the IPv6 documentation prefixes
   [RFC3849] and example domain names [RFC2606].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].


3.  Documentation Address Blocks

   The blocks 192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET-1), 198.51.100.0/24 (TEST-NET-2),
   and 203.0.113.0/24 (TEST-NET-3) are provided for use in
   documentation.


4.  Operational Implications

   Addresses within the TEST-NET-1, TEST-NET-2, and TEST-NET-3 blocks
   SHOULD NOT appear on the public Internet and are used without any
   coordination with IANA or an Internet registry [RFC2050].  Network
   operators SHOULD add these address blocks to the list of non-
   routeable address space, and if packet filters are deployed, then
   this address block SHOULD be added to packet filters.

   These blocks are not for local use, and the filters may be used in
   both local and public contexts.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security implications.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should record the allocation of the three address blocks in the
   IPv4 address registry.  No end party is to be assigned these
   addresses.
