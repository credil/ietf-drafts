    <section title="Preface">

      <t>This document is intended to define the "OpenPGP" message
	header field.  This field should be considered "informational"
	(and "optional"), and be suitable for both
	<xref target="RFC2822">mail</xref>
	and <xref target="RFC1036">netnews</xref> messages.  This
	field should be used to provide information about the
	sender's <xref target="RFC4880">OpenPGP</xref> key.  This
	field MAY be used in any message.</t>

      <t>This document should be interpreted within the context of RFC
	2822. In the event of a discrepancy, refer to that
	document.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
	NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
	"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
	in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Background and Motivation">

      <t>There are quite a few PGP and GnuPG users who add header
	fields with information about the sender's OpenPGP key.
	Fields in current use include "X-PGP:", "X-PGP-Key:",
	"X-Request-PGP:", "X-PGP-KeyID:", and "X-PGP-Fingerprint:".
	The fields are not standardized, so they cannot be reliably
	parsed automatically by applications, only parsed by
	humans.</t>

      <t>Since both PGP and GnuPG rely on the OpenPGP protocol, it
	appear preferable to use the term "OpenPGP" rather than "PGP",
	or "GPG", in the field name.  The latter forms appear as
	underhanded attempts to advocate specific applications, rather
	than the open standard they both share.  The field specified
	here is named "OpenPGP".</t>

      <t>The OpenPGP field is not a required part of successful use of
	OpenPGP in e-mail.  It is intended as a convenience, in those
	situations where the user experience may be enhanced by using
	the information in the field.  Consequently, the information
	in the field should not disrupt the normal OpenPGP key
	retrieval and web of trust mechanism.  Neither the integrity
	nor the authenticity of the information in the field should be
	assumed to be correct or be trust-worthy.</t>

      <t>No specific scenario when the field should be used, nor how
	it should be used in that scenario, are suggested by this
	document.  It is acknowledged that the dominant use of the
	information in the field may be by humans and not
	applications.</t>

      <t>To promote good use of the field, care should be taken so
	that applications do not trigger error messages that may annoy
	the user, when an error condition arise during handling of the
	OpenPGP field.  It is generally recommended that an
	implementation ignore the presence of the OpenPGP fields if an
	error condition occur.  Since the field is optional, this
	approach should not be difficult to implement.  The philosophy
	here is to enable an enhanced user experience.  Error messages
	rarely contribute to that goal.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="OpenPGP Header Field">

      <t>The OpenPGP header field is intended to present
	characteristics of the sender's OpenPGP key.  The field may
	contain the Key ID and the URL where the key can be
	retrieved.</t>
      
      <t>Because the header is typically not integrity protected, the
	information conveyed in the OpenPGP header field MUST NOT be
	trusted without additional verification.  Some of the
	information given in this field may also be given on the
	OpenPGP key itself.  When these two sources conflict, users
	SHOULD favor the information from the OpenPGP key, as that
	information can be cryptographically protected.</t>

      <t>The field is of a "structured" type (see section 2.2.2 of RFC
	2822).  In general, the structure consist of one or more
	parameters, each consisting of one attribute and one value.
	The terminology and format of the field was inspired
	by <xref target="RFC2045">MIME</xref>.  The various provisions
	of RFC 2045 apply.  In particular, the value part of all
	parameters may be quoted; whitespace, foldoing and comments
	may occur in the middle of parameters.  The provisions
	of <xref target="RFC2231">MIME</xref> also apply; in
	particular it deals with handling parameters of excessive
	length.</t>

      <t>In the <xref target="RFC5234">Augmented BNF</xref> notation,
	the OpenPGP header field is defined as below.  By itself,
	however, this grammar is incomplete.  It refers by name to
	several syntax rules that are defined by RFC 2822 and
	the <xref target="RFC3986">URI syntax document</xref>.  Rather
	than reproduce those definitions here, and risk unintentional
	differences between the two, this document refer the reader to
	RFC 2822 and RFC 3986 for the definition of non-terminals.</t>

      <t>Unrecognized parameters MUST be ignored.  The grammar permit
	them to allow for future extensions.  The field SHOULD NOT
	appear more than once within a message.  A given parameter
	type (i.e., "id", "url" or "preference") MUST NOT occur more
	than once.</t>

      <figure>
	<artwork>
openpgp    :=  "OpenPGP:"
               (openpgp-parameter *(";" openpgp-parameter))
               CRLF

id         := 8*HEXDIG

url        := absoluteURI  ; Defined in RFC 3986.

preference := "sign" / "encrypt" / "signencrypt" / "unprotected"

openpgp-parameter
           := ("id" "=" id) /
              ("url" "=" url) /
              ("preference" "=" preference) /
              parameter   ; See RFC 2045 for definition of parameter.
      	</artwork>
      </figure>

      <section title="Primary Key ID field: id">

	<t>The "id" attribute=value pair, if present, MUST define the
	  primary key ID.  The value MUST identify the key ID (in
	  either short or long form) or the fingerprint, all using
	  the <xref target="RFC4648">hex</xref> notation.</t>

	<t>The length of the field imply the kind of key id, i.e.,
	  short or long form, or a v3 or v4 key.</t>

	<t>Note that each of the following examples includes a
	  comment, which is optional.</t>

	<figure>
	  <artwork>
    id=12345678 (short key ID)
    id=1234567890ABCDEF (long key ID)
    id=1234567890abcdef01234567890ABCDEF0123456 (v4 fingerprint)
    id=1234567890ABCDEF01234567890ABCDE (v3 fingerprint, deprecated)
	  </artwork>
	</figure>

      </section>

      <section title="Key URL field: url">

	<t>The "url" attribute=value pair, if present, MUST specify a
	  URL where the public key can be found.  It is RECOMMENDED to
	  use a common URL family, such as <xref target="RFC2616">
	    HTTP</xref> or <xref target="RFC0959">FTP</xref>.  The URL
	  MUST be fully qualified, MUST explicitly specify a protocol
	  and SHOULD be accessible on the public Internet.</t>

	<t>For example:</t>

	<figure>
	  <artwork>
    url=http://example.org/pgp.txt
	  </artwork>
	</figure>

      </section>

      <section title="Protection Preference Field: preference">

	<t>The "preference" attribute=value pair, if present, specify
	  the quality of protection preferred by the sender.  The
	  available choices are "unprotected" which means that the
	  sender prefer not to receive OpenPGP protected e-mails.  A
	  "sign" token means that the sender prefer to receive
	  digitally signed e-mails.  A "encrypt" token means that the
	  sender prefer to receive digitally encrypted e-mails.  A
	  "signencrypt" token means that the sender prefer to receive
	  digitally encrypted and signed e-mails.  Note that there is
	  no technical requirement on the receiver to follow the
	  stated preference.</t>

	<t>For example:</t>

	<figure>
	  <artwork>
    preference=sign
    preference="unprotected"
    preference=ENCRYPT
	  </artwork>
	</figure>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Comments">

      <t>As discussed in section 3.2.3 of RFC 2822, comments may
	appear in header field bodies.  Comments are not intended to
	be interpreted by any application, but to provide additional
	information for humans.</t>

      <t>The following are examples of OpenPGP fields with
	comments:</t>

      <figure>
	<artwork>
  id=B565716F (key stored on non-networked laptop)
  id=12345678 (1024 bit RSA Key for Encrypt or Sign)
  id=ABCD0123 (created Sun Jan  2 02:25:15 CET 2005)
	</artwork>
      </figure>

    </section>

    <section title="Examples">

      <t>These are valid examples of how the field may be used.  This
	list is not meant to be exhaustive, but do reflect expected
	typical usages.</t>

      <figure>
	<artwork>
  OpenPGP: id=12345678
  OpenPGP: url=http://example.com/key.txt
  OpenPGP: preference=unprotected
  OpenPGP: url=http://example.com/key.txt; id=12345678
  OpenPGP: id=12345678; url=http://example.com/key.txt;
           preference=signencrypt
  OpenPGP: url=http://example.com/key.txt (down 2-3pm UTC);
           id=12345678 (this key is only used at the office);
           preference=sign (unsigned emails are filtered away)
	</artwork>
      </figure>

    </section>

    <section title="Open Issues">

      <t>Should there be a "supports" field, that signal whether the
	sender support inline PGP or PGP/MIME?  As in
	supports="inline, mime" or similar.  Should it be in preferred
	priority order?  This draft tentatively closes this issue by
	ignoring the matter, until someone proposes text.</t>

      <t>The ABNF definition is known to be under-specified.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <t>The OpenPGP header field is intended to be a convenience in
	locating public keys.  They are neither secure nor intended to
	be.  Since the message header is easy to spoof, information
	contained in the header should not be trusted.  The
	information must be verified.</t>

      <t>Applications that interpret the field MUST NOT assume that
	the content is correct, and MUST NOT present the data to the
	user in any way that would cause the user to assume that it is
	correct.  Applications that interpret the data within the
	field SHOULD alert the user that this information is not a
	substitute for personally verifying keys and being a part of
	the web of trust.</t>

      <t>If an application receives a signed message and uses the
	information in the field to retrieve a key, the application
	MAY ignore the retrieved key if it is not the same key used to
	sign the message.  This SHOULD be done before the newly
	retrieved key is imported into the user's keyring.</t>

      <t>The use of <xref target="RFC2818">HTTPS</xref>,
	<xref target="RFC4033">DNSSEC</xref>,
	<xref target="RFC3207">SMTP
	STARTTLS</xref>, <xref target="RFC2595">IMAP/POP3
	STARTTLS</xref> and other secure protocols, may enhance the
	security of information conveyed through this field, but does
	not guarantee any level of security or authenticity.
	Developers and users must remain aware of this.</t>

      <t>Version 3 OpenPGP keys can be created with a chosen key id
	(aka "the 0xDEADBEEF attack").  Verifying the Key ID of a
	retrived key against the one provided in the field is thus not
	sufficient to protect against a man-in-the-middle attack.
	Instead, the web-of-trust mechanism should be used.</t>

      <t>If an attacker wants to check the validity of Email
	addresses, he might send out junk email to arbitrary addresses
	and collect those that report back to the crafted OpenPGP URL.
	To protect against this, implementations MUST inform the user
	of that potential privacy issue when retrieving keys from an
	URL provided by the field of an inbound email message: either
	when the feature is enabled or to be used for the first time
	or every time the MUA detects an unknown key.</t>

      <t>Given the flexibility of the syntax of the field, slightly
	varying the content between messages can be used as a covert
	channel.</t>
