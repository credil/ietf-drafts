2.  Introduction

   This document defines binary formats for IPv4 and IPv6 Traffic
   Selector sub-options as defined in [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding].

   The binary traffic selector sub-options defined here, allow efficient
   identification of flow(s) based on well known fields in IPv4
   [RFC0791], IPv6 [RFC2460], and transport layer headers like TCP
   [RFC0793] and UDP [RFC0768].

   Flags (A-N)

      Each flag indicates whether the corresponding field is present in
      the message

   (A)Start Source Address

      This field identifies the first source address, from the range of
      32-bit IPv4 addresses to be matched, on data packets as seen by
      the home agent.  In other words this is one of the addresses of
      the correspondent node.

   (B)End Source Address

      If more than one contiguous source addresses need to be mached
      then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start Source Address field.  This
      field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Source Address field
      is included.  When this field is included the receiver will match
      all of the addresses between fields (A) and (B), inclusive of (A)
      and (B).

   (C)Start Destination Address

      This field identifies the first destination address, from the
      range of 32-bit IPv4 addresses to be matched, on data packets as
      seen by the home agent.  In other words this is one of the
      registered addresses of the mobile node.

   (D)End Destination Address

      If more than one contiguous destination addresses need to be
      mached then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a
      range starting from the value of the Start Destination Address
      field.  This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start
      Destination Address field is included.  When this field is
      included the receiver will match all of the addresses between
      fields (C) and (D), inclusive of (C) and (D).

   (E)Start SPI - Security Parameter Index

      This field identifies the first 32-bit SPI value, from the range
      of SPI values to be matched, on data packets as seen by the home
      agent.  This field is defined in [RFC4303]

   (F)End SPI - Security Parameter Index

      If more than one contiguous SPI values need to be mached then this
      field can be used to indicate the end value of a range starting
      from the value of the Start SPI field.  This field MUST NOT be
      included unless the Start SPI field is included.  When this field
      is included the receiver will match all of the SPI values between
      fields (E) and (F), inclusive of (E) and (F).

   (G)Start Source Port

      This field identifies the first 16-bit source port number, from
      the range of port numbers to be matched, on data packets as seen
      by the home agent.

   (H)End Source Port

      If more than one contiguous source port numbers need to be mached
      then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start Source Port field.  This
      field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Source Port field is
      included.  When this field is included the receiver will match all
      of the port numbers between fields (G) and (H), inclusive of (G)
      and (H).

   (I)Start Destination Port

      This field identifies the first 16-bit destination port number,
      from the range of port numbers to be matched, on data packets as
      seen by the home agent.

   (J)End Destination Port

      If more than one contiguous destination port numbers need to be
      mached then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a
      range starting from the value of the Start Destination Port field.
      This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Destination Port
      field is included.  When this field is included the receiver will
      match all of the port numbers between fields (I) and (K),
      inclusive of (I) and (J).

   (K)Start DS - Differential Services

      This field identifies the first differential services value, from
      the range of differential services values to be matched, on data
      packets as seen by the home agent.  Note that this field is called
      Type of Service field in [RFC0791].  [RFC3260] then clarified that
      the field has been redefined as 6 bits DS field and 2 bits
      reserved, later claimed by Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
      [RFC3168].  For the purpose of this specification the DS field is

      8bit long, were the 6 most significant bits indicating the DS
      field to be matched and the 2 list significant bits MUST be set to
      0 by the sender and ignored by the receiver.

   (L)End DS - Differential Services

      If more than one contiguous DS values need to be mached then this
      field can be used to indicate the end value of a range starting
      from the value of the Start DS field.  This field MUST NOT be
      included unless the Start DS field is included.  When this field
      is included the receiver will match all of the values between
      fields (K) and (L), inclusive of (K) and (L).

   (M)Start Protocol

      This field identifies the first 8-bit protocol value, from the
      range of protocol values to be matched, on data packets as seen by
      the home agent.

   (N)End Protocol

      If more than one contiguous protocol values need to be mached then
      this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start Protocol field.  This field
      MUST NOT be included unless the Start Protocol field is included.
      When this field is included the receiver will match all of the
      values between fields (M) and (N), inclusive of (M) and (N).

   Reserved

      Reserved for future use.  These bits MUST be set to zero by the
      sender and ignored by the receiver.

3.2.  IPv6 binary traffic selector

   If the TS Format field of the traffic selector sub-option indicates
   "IPv6 binary traffic selector", then the traffic selector is
   formatted as follows:

         0                   1                   2                   3

      Each flag indicates whether the corresponding field is present in
      the message

   (A)Start Source Address

      This field identifies the first source address, from the range of
      128-bit IPv6 addresses to be matched, on data packets as seen by
      the home agent.  In other words this is one of the addresses of
      the correspondent node.

   (B)End Source Address

      If more than one contiguous source addresses need to be mached
      then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start Source Address field.  This
      field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Source Address field
      is included.  When this field is included the receiver will match
      all of the addresses between fields (A) and (B), inclusive of (A)
      and (B).

   (C)Start Destination Address

      This field identifies the first destination address, from the
      range of 128-bit IPv6 addresses to be matched, on data packets as
      seen by the home agent.  In other words this is one of the
      registered addresses of the mobile node.

   (D)End Destination Address

      If more than one contiguous destination addresses need to be
      mached then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a
      range starting from the value of the Start Destination Address
      field.  This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start
      Destination Address field is included.  When this field is
      included the receiver will match all of the addresses between
      fields (C) and (D), inclusive of (C) and (D).

   (E)Start SPI - Security Parameter Index

      This field identifies the first 32-bit SPI value, from the range
      of SPI values to be matched, on data packets as seen by the home
      agent.

   (F)End SPI - Security Parameter Index

      If more than one contiguous SPI values need to be mached then this
      field can be used to indicate the end value of a range starting
      from the value of the Start SPI field.  This field MUST NOT be

      included unless the Start SPI field is included.  When this field
      is included the receiver will match all of the SPI values between
      fields (E) and (F), inclusive of (E) and (F).

   (G)Start Flow Label

      This field identifies the first flow label value, from the range
      of flow label values to be matched, on data packets as seen by the
      home agent.  According to [RFC2460] the flow label is 24-bit long.
      For the purpose of this specification the sender of this options
      MUST prefix flow label values with 8-bits of "0" before inserting
      it in this field.  The receive SHOULD ignore the first 8-bits of
      this field.

   (H)End Flow Label

      If more than one contiguous flow label values need to be mached
      then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start Flow Label field.  This field
      MUST NOT be included unless the Start Flow Label field is
      included.  When this field is included the receiver will match all
      of the flow label values between fields (G) and (H), inclusive of
      (G) and (H).

   (I)Start Source Port

      This field identifies the first 16-bit source port number, from
      the range of port numbers to be matched, on data packets as seen
      by the home agent.

   (J)End Source Port

      If more than one contiguous source port numbers need to be mached
      then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start Source Port field.  This
      field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Source Port field is
      included.  When this field is included the receiver will match all
      of the port numbers between fields (I) and (J), inclusive of (I)
      and (J).

   (K)Start Destination Port

      This field identifies the first 16-bit destination port number,
      from the range of port numbers to be matched, on data packets as
      seen by the home agent.

   (L)End Destination Port

      If more than one contiguous destination port numbers need to be
      mached then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a
      range starting from the value of the Start Destination Port field.
      This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Destination Port
      field is included.  When this field is included the receiver will
      match all of the port numbers between fields (K) and (L),
      inclusive of (K) and (L).

   (M)Start DS - Differential Services

      This field identifies the first differential services value, from
      the range of differential services values to be matched, on data
      packets as seen by the home agent.  Note that this field is called
      Type of Service field in [RFC0791].  [RFC3260] then clarified that
      the field has been redefined as 6 bits DS field and 2 bits
      reserved, later claimed by Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
      [RFC3168].  For the purpose of this specification the DS field is
      8bit long, were the 6 most significant bits indicating the DS
      field to be matched and the 2 list significant bits MUST be set to
      0 by the sender and ignored by the receiver.

   (N)End DS - Differential Services

      If more than one contiguous DS values need to be mached then this
      field can be used to indicate the end value of a range starting
      from the value of the Start DS field.  This field MUST NOT be
      included unless the Start DS field is included.  When this field
      is included the receiver will match all of the values between
      fields (M) and (N), inclusive of (M) and (N).

   (O)Start NH - Next Header

      This field identifies the first 8-bit next header value, from the
      range of next header values to be matched, on data packets as seen
      by the home agent.

   (P)End NH - Next Header

      If more than one contiguous next header values need to be mached
      then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range
      starting from the value of the Start NH field.  This field MUST
      NOT be included unless the Start next header field is included.
      When this field is included the receiver will match all of the
      values between fields (O) and (P), inclusive of (O) and (P).

      Reserved for future use.  These bits MUST be set to zero by the
      sender and ignored by the receiver.
