                  Host Identity Protocol Certificates
                         draft-ietf-hip-cert-05

Abstract

   The CERT parameter is a container for X.509.v3 certificates and
   Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI) certificates.  It is used for
   carrying these certificates in Host Identity Protocol (HIP) control
   packets.  This document only specifies the certificate parameter and
   the error signaling in case of a failed verification.  The use of
   certificates including how certificates are obtained, requested, and
   which actions are taken upon successful or failed verification are to
   be defined in the documents that use the certificate parameter.
   Additionally, this document specifies the representations of Host
   Identity Tags in X.509.v3 and SPKI certificates.

1.  Introduction

   Digital certificates bind a piece of information to a public key by
   means of a digital signature, and thus, enable the holder of a
   private key to generate cryptographically verifiable statements.  The
   Host Identity Protocol (HIP) [RFC5201] defines a new cryptographic
   namespace based on asymmetric cryptography.  The identity of each
   host is derived from a public key, allowing hosts to digitally sign
   data with their private key.  This document specifies the CERT
   parameter, which is used to transmit digital certificates in HIP.  It
   fills the placeholder specified in Section 5.2 of [RFC5201].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  CERT Parameter

   The CERT parameter is a container for certain types of digital
   certificates.  It MAY either carry SPKI certificates or X.509.v3
   certificates.  It does not specify any certificate semantics.
   However, it defines supplementary parameters that help HIP hosts to
   transmit semantically grouped CERT parameters in a more systematic
   way.  The specific use of the CERT parameter for different use cases
   is intentionally not discussed in this document.

   The CERT parameter is covered, when present, by the HIP SIGNATURE

   field and is a non-critical parameter.

   The CERT parameter can be used in all HIP packets but using it in the
   I1 packet is not recommended because it can increase the processing
   times of I1s, which can be problematic when processing storms of I1s.
   Each HIP control packet MAY contain multiple CERT parameters.  These
   parameters MAY be related or unrelated.  Related certificates are
   managed in Cert groups.  A Cert group specifies a group of related
   CERT parameters that SHOULD be interpreted in a certain order (e.g.
   for expressing certificate chains).  For grouping CERT parameters,
   the Cert group and the Cert count field MUST be set.  Ungrouped
   certificates exhibit a unique Cert group field and set the Cert count
   to 1.  CERT parameters with the same Cert group number in the group
   field indicate a logical grouping.  The Cert count field indicates
   the number of CERT parameters in the group.

   CERT parameters that belong to the same Cert group MAY be contained
   in multiple sequential HIP control packets.  This is indicated by a
   higher Cert count than the amount of CERT parameters with matching
   Cert group fields in a HIP control packet.  The CERT parameters MUST
   be placed in ascending order, within a HIP control packet, according
   to their Cert group field.  Cert groups MAY only span multiple
   packets if the Cert group does not fit the packet.  Only a single
   Cert group MAY span two subsequent packets.

   The Cert ID acts as a sequence number to identify the certificates in
   a Cert group.  The numbers in the Cert ID field MUST start from 1 up
   to Cert count.

   The Cert Group and Cert ID namespaces are managed locally by each
   host that sends CERT parameters in HIP control packets.

             |           Cert format          | Type number |

             |   Distinguished Name of SPKI   |      8      |
             +--------------------------------+-------------+

   The next sections outline the use of HITs in X.509.v3 and in SPKI
   certificates.  X.509.v3 certificates are defined in [RFC3280].  The
   wire format for X.509.v3 is Distinguished Encoding Rules format as
   defined in [X.690].  The SPKI and its formats are defined in
   [RFC2693].

   Hash and URL encodings (3 and 4) are used as defined in [RFC4306]
   Section 3.6.  Using hash and URL encodings results in smaller HIP
   control packets, but requires the receiver to resolve the URL or
   check a local cache against the hash.

Internet-Draft                  HIP CERT                   November 2010


   LDAP URL encodings (5 and 6) are used as defined in [RFC2255].  Using
   LDAP URL encoding results in smaller HIP control packets but requires
   the receiver to retrieve the certificate or check a local cache
   against the URL.

   Distinguished name (DN) encodings (7 and 8) are used as defined in
   [RFC1779].  Using the DN encoding results in smaller HIP control
   packets, but requires the receiver to retrieve the certificate or
   check a local cache against the DN.


3.  X.509.v3 Certificate Object and Host Identities

   When using X.509.v3 certificates to transmit information related to
   HIP hosts, HITs MAY be enclosed within the certificates.  HITs can
   represent an issuer, a subject, or both.  In X.509.v3 HITs are
   represented as issuer or subject alternative name extensions as
   defined in [RFC2459].  If only HIT of the host is presented as either
   the issuer or the subject the respective HIT MUST be placed into the
   respective entity's DN's Common Name (CN) section in a colon
   delimited presentation format defined in [RFC5952].  Inclusion of CN
   is not necessary if DN contains any other naming information.  It is
   RECOMMENDED to use the FQDN/NAI from the hosts HOST_ID parameter in
   the DN if one exists.  The full HIs are presented in the public key
   entries of X.509.v3 certificates.

   The following examples illustrate how HITs are presented as issuer
   and subject in the DN and in the X.509.v3 extension alternative
   names.

       Format of DN:
           Issuer: CN=hit-of-issuer
           Subject: CN=hit-of-issuer

       Example DN:
           Issuer: CN=2001:14:6cf:fae7:bb79:bf78:7d64:c056
           Subject: CN=2001:1c:5a14:26de:a07c:385b:de35:60e3

       Format of X509v3 extensions:
           X509v3 Issuer Alternative Name:
               IP Address:HIT-OF-ISSUER
           X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
               IP Address:HIT-OF-SUBJECT

       Example X509v3 extensions:
           X509v3 Issuer Alternative Name:
               IP Address:2001:14:6CF:FAE7:BB79:BF78:7D64:C056
           X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
               IP Address:2001:1C:5A14:26DE:A07C:385B:DE35:60E3

   Appendix B shows a full example X.509.v3 certificate with HIP
   content.

   As another example, consider a managed PKI environment in which the
   peers have certificates that are anchored in (potentially different)
   managed trust chains.  In this scenario, the certificates issued to
   HIP hosts are signed by intermediate Certificate Authorities (CAs) up
   to a root CA.  In this example, the managed PKI environment is
   neither HIP aware, nor can it be configured to compute HITs and
   include them in the certificates.

   In this scenario, it is RECOMMENDED that the HIP peers have and use
   some mechanism of defining trusted root CAs for the purpose of
   establishing HIP communications.  Furthermore it is recommended that
   the HIP peers have and use some mechanism of checking peer
   certificate validity for revocation, signature, minimum cryptographic
   strength, etc., up to the trusted root CA.

   When HIP communications are established, the HIP hosts not only need
   to send their identity certificates (or pointers to their
   certificates), but also the chain of intermediate CAs (or pointers to
   the CAs) up to the root CA, or to a CA that is trusted by the remote
   peer.  This chain of certificates MUST be sent in a Cert group as
   specified in Section 2.  The HIP peers validate each other's
   Certificates and compute peer HITs based on the Certificate public
   keys.

4.  SPKI Cert Object and Host Identities

   When using SPKI certificates to transmit information related to HIP
   hosts, HITs need to be enclosed within the certificates.  HITs can
   represent an issuer, a subject, or both.  In the following we define
   the representation of those identifiers for SPKI given as
   S-expressions.  Note that the S-expressions are only the human-
   readable representation of SPKI certificates.  Full HIs are presented
   in the public key sequences of SPKI certificates.

   As an example the Host Identity Tag of a host is expressed as
   follows:


       Format:  (hash hit hit-of-host)
       Example: (hash hit 2001:13:724d:f3c0:6ff0:33c2:15d8:5f50)

   Appendix A shows a full example SPKI certificate with HIP content.


5.  Revocation of Certificates

   Revocation of X.509.v3 certificates is handled as defined in Section
   5 in [RFC2459].  Revocation of SPKI certificates is handled as
   defined in Section 5 in [RFC2693].


6.  Error signaling

   If the Initiator does not send the certificate that the Responder
   requires the Responder may take actions (e.g. reject the connection).
   The Responder MAY signal this to the Initiator by sending a HIP
   NOTIFY message with NOTIFICATION parameter error type
   CREDENTIALS_NEEDED.

   If the verification of a certificate fails, a verifier MAY signal
   this to the provider of the certificate by sending a HIP NOTIFY
   message with NOTIFICATION parameter error type INVALID_CERTIFICATE.

     ------------------------------------     -----

     CREDENTIALS_REQUIRED                      48

     The Responder is unwilling to set up an association
     as the Initiator did not send the needed credentials.

     Notification Data MAY contain n groups of 2 octets (n calculated
     from the NOTIFICATION parameter length), in order Cert group and
     Cert ID of the certificate parameter that caused the failure.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the CERT parameter for the Host Identity
   Protocol [RFC5201].  This parameter is defined in Section 2 with type
   768.  The parameter type number is also defined in [RFC5201].

   The CERT parameter has 8-bit unsigned integer field for different
   certificate types, for which IANA is to create and maintain a new
   sub-registry entitled "HIP certificate types" under the "Host
   Identity Protocol (HIP) Parameters".  Initial values for the
   Certificate type registry are given in Section 2.

   In Section 6 this document defines two new types for "NOTIFY message
   types" sub-registry under "Host Identity Protocol (HIP) Parameters".


8.  Security Considerations

   Certificate grouping allows the certificates to be sent in multiple
   consecutive packets.  This might allow similar attacks as IP-layer
   fragmentation allows, for example sending of fragments in wrong order
   and skipping some fragments to delay or stall packet processing by
   the victim in order to use resources (e.g.  CPU or memory).

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use grouping or hash and URL encodings when
   HIP aware middleboxes are anticipated to be present on the
   communication path between peers because fetching remote certificates
   require the middlebox to buffer the packets and to request remote
   data.  This makes these devices prone to denial of service (DoS)
   attacks.  Moreover, middleboxes and responders that request remote
   certificates can be used as deflectors for distributed denial of
   service attacks.
