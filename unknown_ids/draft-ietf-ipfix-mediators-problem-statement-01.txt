Abstract

   Flow-based measurement is currently a popular method for various
   network monitoring usages.  The sharing of flow-based information
   among orthogonal monitoring applications raises open issues in terms
   of scalability, reliability and flexibility that IPFIX Mediation may
   help resolve.  IPFIX Mediation reroutes, replicates, filters,
   aggregates, correlates or modifies Flow Records or Packet Reports, or
   changes a transport protocol.  This document describes the
   applicability of IPFIX Mediation and the problems that IPFIX
   Mediation might encounter.

1.  Introduction

   While the IPFIX requirements defined in [RFC3917] mention an
   intermediate function, such as an IPFIX Proxy or an Concentrator,
   there is no document to define the function called IPFIX Mediation.
   IPFIX Mediation is an additional function to suit the needs of some
   measurement system.  In this document, we describe several applicable
   examples of IPFIX Mediation.  Furthermore, we describe the problems
   of IPFIX Mediation considering implementations.  These problems can
   be solved by additional specifications without influencing the
   present IPFIX specification defined in [RFC5101].

   Section 2 describes the terminology used in this document.  Section 3
   describes applicable examples of IPFIX Mediation.  As more effective
   cases, section 4 describes some usages of the IPFIX Mediation in
   large-scale networks.  Finally, section 5 describes the problems an
   implementation of an IPFIX Mediation device might face.

2.  Terminology and Definition

   The terms in this section are in line with those in the IPFIX
   specification document [RFC5101] and the PSAMP specification document
   [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol].  Additional terms required for the IPFIX
   Mediation are also defined here.  All these terms are capitalized in
   this document.

   Observation Point

      An Observation Point is a location in the network where IP packets
      can be observed.  Examples include: a line to which a probe is
      attached, a shared medium, such as an Ethernet-based LAN, a single
      port of a router, or a set of interfaces (physical or logical) of
      a router.

      Note that every Observation Point is associated with an
      Observation Domain (defined below), and that one Observation Point
      may be a superset of several other Observation Points.  For
      example, one Observation Point can be an entire line card.  That
      would be the superset of the individual Observation Points at the
      line card's interfaces.

   Observation Domain

      An Observation Domain is the largest set of Observation Points for
      which Flow information can be aggregated by a Metering Process.
      For example, a router line card may be an Observation Domain if it
      is composed of several interfaces, each of which is an Observation
      Point.  In the IPFIX Message it generates, the Observation Domain
      includes its Observation Domain ID, which is unique per Exporting
      Process.  That way, the Collecting Process can identify the
      specific Observation Domain from the Exporter that sends the IPFIX
      Messages.  Every Observation Point is associated with an
      Observation Domain.  It is RECOMMENDED that Observation Domain IDs
      also be unique per IPFIX Device.

   Flow Key

      Each of the fields that:

      1. belong to the packet header (e.g., destination IP address),

      2. are a property of the packet itself (e.g., packet length),

      3. are derived from packet treatment (e.g., Autonomous System (AS)
      number),

Internet-Draft         Mediation Problem Statement        September 2008


      and that are used to define a Flow are termed Flow Keys.

   Flow Record

      A Flow Record contains information about a specific Flow that was
      observed at an Observation Point.  A Flow Record contains measured
      properties of the Flow (e.g., the total number of bytes for all
      the Flow's packets) and usually characteristic properties of the
      Flow (e.g., source IP address).

   Packet Reports

      Packet Reports comprise a configurable subset of a packet's input
      to the Selection Process, including the Packet Content,
      information relating to its treatment (for example, the output
      interface), and its associated selection state (for example, a
      hash of the Packet Content).

   Exporting Process

      The Exporting Process sends Flow Records to one or more Collecting
      Processes.  The Flow Records are generated by one or more Metering
      Processes.

   Exporter

      A device that hosts one or more Exporting Processes is termed an
      Exporter.

   IPFIX Device

      An IPFIX Device hosts at least one Exporting Process.  It may host
      further Exporting Processes and arbitrary numbers of Observation
      Points and Metering Processes.

   Collecting Process

      A Collecting Process receives Flow Records from one or more
      Exporting Processes.  The Collecting Process might process or
      store received Flow Records, but such actions are out of scope for
      this document.

   Collector

      A device that hosts one or more Collecting Processes is termed a
      Collector.

   IPFIX Message

      An IPFIX Message is a message originating at the Exporting Process
      that carries the IPFIX records of this Exporting Process and whose
      destination is a Collecting Process.  An IPFIX Message is
      encapsulated at the transport layer.

   Information Element

      An Information Element is a protocol and encoding-independent
      description of an attribute that may appear in an IPFIX Record.
      The IPFIX information model [RFC5102] defines the base set of
      Information Elements for IPFIX.  The type associated with an
      Information Element indicates constraints on what it may contain
      and also determines the valid encoding mechanisms for use in
      IPFIX.

   IPFIX Mediation

      IPFIX Mediation is a function located between Exporting Processes
      and Collecting Processes.  The IPFIX Mediation can be included in
      any IPFIX Devices.  The IPFIX Mediation consists of a set of some
      of functions:

      *  rerouting input Flow Records/Packet Reports to a appropriate
         Collecting Process

      *  replicating input Flow Records/Packet Reports

      *  filtering and selecting input Flow Records/Packet Reports

      *  aggregating input Flow Records/Packet Reports based on new Flow
         Keys

      *  correlating a set of Flow Records/Packet Reports for creating
         new Flow Records/Packet Reports with new metrics

      *  modifying input Flow Records/Packet Reports

      *  changing a transport protocol which carries IPFIX Messages

      The modification of Flow Records/Packet Reports includes these
      functions:

      *  changing the value of specified Information Elements

      *  adding new Information Elements by deriving further Flow or
         packet properties from existing fields or calculating new

         metrics

      *  deleting specified Information Elements.

      IPFIX Mediation can be included in any devices, such as routers,
      switches, NMS(Network Management Systems), or be deployed in
      stand-alone devices.

   Flow-Based Collector Selection

      The Flow-Based Collector Selection evaluates an input Flow Record/
      Packet Report based on the value of the specified Information
      Element and then selects Collector for each input Flow Record/
      Packet Report.

   IPFIX Mediator

      An IPFIX Mediator contains one or more functions defined in IPFIX
      Mediation.  The IPFIX Mediator can be a stand-alone or a virtual
      device.  It also contains one or more Collecting Processes and one
      or more Exporting Processes.

   Original Exporter

      An Original Exporter is an IPFIX Device which hosts Observation
      Points where IP packets can be directly observed.

   IPFIX Proxy

      An IPFIX Proxy is an IPFIX Mediator that receives IPFIX Messages
      from Original Exporter, and sends IPFIX Messages to one or more
      Collectors.  It may alter a part of IPFIX Message in order to
      comply with IPFIX Protocol specifications.  It may also change
      type of transport protocol, such as UDP, TCP, SCTP and PR-SCTP,
      and convert a legacy protocol message to an IPFIX Message, if
      necessary.

   IPFIX Concentrator

      An IPFIX Concentrator is an IPFIX Mediator that receives Flow
      Records/Packet Reports, aggregates them, then exports the
      aggregated Flow Records.

   IPFIX Distributor

      An IPFIX Distributor is an IPFIX Mediator that reroutes input Flow
      Records/Packet Reports based on the result of Flow-Based Collector
      Selection.  It may filter or replicate input Flow Records/Packet

      Reports, if necessary.

   IPFIX Masquerading Proxy

      An IPFIX Masquerading Proxy is an IPFIX Mediator that screens out
      a part of data of input Flow Records/Packet Reports according to
      configured policies.  It can thus, for example, hide the network
      topology information or customers' IP addresses.

3.  Flow-Based Mediation: Applicability Examples

3.1.  IPFIX Export Across Domains

   IPFIX export across administrative domains can be used to measure
   traffic for wide-area traffic engineering, or to analyze the trend of
   Internet traffic.  In such cases, operators need to adhere to privacy
   policies and prevent the transmission of confidential information.
   Using an IPFIX Masquerading Proxy allows them to operate on Flow
   Records safely by anonymizing and filtering them.  IP Flow
   anonymisation is described in [I-D.boschi-ipfix-anon] in detail.

3.2.  Data Retention

   Data retention refers to the storage of traffic data by service
   providers and commercial organizations.  According to European
   Commission directives, operators are required to retain both IP and
   voice traffic data, in wired and wireless networks, generated by end
   users while using a service provider's services.  The goal of data
   retention is to ensure that call detail records and Flow Records are
   available for the purpose of detection, investigation, and
   prosecution of serious crimes, if necessary.  The European Commission
   directives define the following data retention services:

   o  Fixed telephony (includes fixed voice, voicemail, and conference
      and data calls)

   o  Mobile telephony (includes mobile voice, voicemail, conference and
      data calls, SMS, and MMS)

   o  Internet telephony (includes every multimedia session associated
      with IP multimedia services)

   o  Internet e-mail

   o  Internet access

   By monitoring Flow Records, IPFIX can fulfill these requirements of
   Internet access services.

3.3.  Interoperability between Legacy Protocols and IPFIX

   During the migration process from a legacy protocol such as NetFlow
   [RFC3954] to IPFIX, both NetFlow and IPFIX Exporters will need to co-
   exist in the same network.  An IPFIX Proxy which converts a legacy
   protocol to IPFIX will allow operators to continue measuring Flows
   from legacy Exporters, even after introducing IPFIX Collectors.

Internet-Draft         Mediation Problem Statement        September 2008


3.4.  Rerouting Flow Records/Packet Reports

   Recently, several networks seem to have shifted towards integrated
   networks, such as the Internet and MPLS, which includes IPv4, IPv6,
   and VPN traffic.  Flow Records/Packet Reports of these types need to
   be analyzed separately and from different perspectives.  However,
   handling them separately without improving the capability of the
   Collector is difficult.  An IPFIX Distributor rerouting Flow Records/
   Packet Reports based on the result of Flow-based Collector Selection,
   would be necessary.  Thus, it allows individual Collectors related to
   each network to analyze traffic data for their own specific purposes.

   As another example, in case of rerouting specific customer's Flow
   Records, an IPFIX Distributor needs to identify each customer.  As
   identification data, the RD (Route Distinguisher), ingress IF,
   peering AS number, or BGP next hop are listed.  As shown in the
   following figure, the IPFIX Distributor reroutes Flow Records based
   on the RD value.  This system allows each customer's traffic to be
   inspected independently.

                        '-----------'    |

3.5.  IPFIX Export from Branch Office

   Generally, in big enterprise networks, traffic data from branch
   offices is gathered in a central office.  But, in the long distance
   branch office case, the bandwidth for transport IPFIX is not enough.



Kobayashi, et al.        Expires March 30, 2009                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         Mediation Problem Statement        September 2008


   Therefore, it is beneficial that an IPFIX Concentrator located in a
   branch office exports aggregated Flow Records to cope with the
   limitation of bandwidth.

3.6.  Correlation of Flow Records/Packet Reports Information

   The correlation of Flow Records/Packet Reports information offers
   some new metrics.  There are some examples as follows:

   o  One way delay follows from correlating Packet Reports exported
      from different Exporters on the path.

   o  The result of a queueing or rate-limiting function applied to
      ingress or egress interface follows from correlating Flow Records
      with the same Flow Key observed at both interfaces.

   o  Average/maximum/minimum values follow from correlating each in a
      set of Flow Records.

4.  Approaches to Scalability

   Usually, operators measure traffic at several Observation Points for
   a specific purpose, typically sampling packets with rates ranging
   from 1/10,000 to 1/100.  This value depends on several factors, such
   as the capacity of the management network, the available storage and
   speed of the Collector, and the load on the routers/switches.

   On the one hand, the number of Observation Points in the networks can
   even be increased to improve the effectiveness of these methods.  In
   the near future, we anticipate that the advanced features of IPFIX,
   such as the monitoring of wide-area traffic matrices and QoS
   performance, will accelerate IPFIX utilization.

   On the other hand, the increasing amount of traffic brought about by
   broadband users might have an impact on measurement parameters, such
   as the sampling rate or granularity of Flows.  Generally, large-scale
   networks already have multiple 10 Gb/s links, their total traffic
   exceeding 100 Gb/s.  In the near future, broadband users' traffic
   will increase by approximately 50% per year according to [TRAFGRW].
   When operators monitor traffic of 500 Gb/s with a sampling rate of
   1/1000, the amount of exported Flow Records from Exporters could
   exceed 50 kFlows/s.  This value is beyond the ability of a single
   Collector.

   This section explains how operators can cope with such a huge amount
   of Flow Records using available IPFIX solutions.  Generally, the
   solutions encompass two approaches: reducing the amount of exported
   Flow Records or increasing the capacity of the Collecting Process.
   The following sub-sections show each solution.

4.1.  Adjusting Sampling Rates

   Adjusting the sampling rate can reduce the amount of Flow Records,
   and a flow-based measurement system can thus easily adapt to the
   ability of the Collecting and Exporting Processes.  However, in that
   case, Flows with small traffic volumes could easily get lost.  If
   traffic incidents happened, operators would no longer be able to
   investigate traffic change.  While traffic volumes on networks
   continue to increase, operators will not be able to maintain the
   sampling rates currently used.  In the near future, flow-based
   measurement systems possibly will not be able to detect traffic
   anomalies which can currently be detected.

4.2.  Flow Aggregation

   The simplest types of Flows are those comprised of all packets having
   a fixed five tuple of protocol, source and destination IP addresses,

   and source and destination port numbers.  On the other hand, choosing
   a shorter Flow Key, such as a three tuple or two tuple, or a single
   Flow Key, such as a network prefix, peering AS number, or BGP Next-
   Hop, creates more aggregated Flow Records.  This solution is
   especially useful for measurements of traffic exchange in an entire
   network domain and for easy adjustments to the performance of a
   Collector.

4.2.1.  Flow Aggregation on Original Exporters

   Original Exporters can aggregate Flow Records to reduce the amount of
   them.  But, in-depth traffic monitoring might not be possible, as it
   is with the five tuple.  One way to this is to be able to specify the
   Template Records for specific needs.  This extra flexibility in the
   Metering Process allows operators to specify their own set of Flow
   Keys and extra Information Elements in the Template Record.
   Specifically, Original Exporters classify the Flow Records by their
   contents, and then aggregate them with appropriate Flow keys based on
   a specific application.  There is an application for security,
   another for capacity planning, and so on.  The content and
   granularity of the Flow can satisfy the requirements of each
   Collector with a specific application.

   On one hand, this optimizes the Metering Process, because only Flows
   of interest are looked at.  On the other hand, it optimizes the
   Exporting Process, because only the information of interest is
   exported.  Finally, this reduces load of the Collecting Process as
   less Flow Records are handled, and Flow Record filtering and
   aggregating are required.

4.2.2.  Flow Aggregation on IPFIX Concentrators

   Another approach involves a hierarchical measurement system using
   IPFIX Concentrators.  Aggregation and storage for input Flow Records
   on IPFIX Concentrators makes a most useful distributed-collection
   system.  It allows other devices to retrieve the stored Flow Record.
   This method increases the capacity of Collecting Process of whole
   system.  Flow aggregation method is described in
   [I-D.dressler-ipfix-aggregation] in detail.

4.3.  Time Composition

   Time composition is defined as aggregation for consecutive Flow
   Records with same Flow Keys.  It leads to the same output as setting
   a longer active interval timer on Original Exporters.  However, an
   IPFIX Mediation can calculate average, maximum and minimum values of
   each counter from Flow Records received with shorter interval time.
   The output allows operators to keep track of changes that might have

Internet-Draft         Mediation Problem Statement        September 2008


   happened during the time interval.

4.4.  Space Composition

   Space composition is defined as aggregation for one or more Flow
   Records involved in a larger Observation Domain or a set of
   Observation Points.  It is divided into two types:

   o  Space Composition within one Exporter

      In that case, the spatial range is within one Exporters.  For
      example, the Flow Records observed at physical interfaces which
      belong to virtual interface by link aggregation can be composed to
      one Flow Records.

   o  Space Composition within some Exporters

      In that case, the spatial range consists of some different
      Exporters.  For example, the Flow Records observed at same domain,
      such as west area and east area of an ISP network, can be composed
      to one Flow Records.

4.5.  Distributing Load among Collectors

   As described in the previous section, an IPFIX Distributor reroutes
   Flow Records/Packet Reports to appropriate Collectors based on the
   result of the Flow-based Collector Selection.  It can thus distribute
   the load among multiple Collectors according to a specific
   application, each area, or each customer.

4.6.  Flow Selection Sampling

   A Flow selection sampling method is described in
   [I-D.peluso-flowselection] in detail.  Generally, the distribution of
   the number of packets per Flow seems to be heavy-tailed.  Most types
   of Flow Records are likely to be small Flows consisting of a small
   number of packets.  The flow-based measurement system, in particular
   the Collecting Process and Exporting Process, is burdened with a huge
   amount of these small Flows.  If statistics information of small
   Flows is exported as merging data by applying a policy or threshold,
   the burden on measurement system is reduced.

5.  Problems with using IPFIX Mediators

   In this section, we focus on the problems related to the use of IPFIX
   Mediators in consideration of implementation.

5.1.  Loss of Observation Point Information

   Both the Exporter IP address indicated by the source IP address of
   the IPFIX session as well as the Observation Domain ID included in
   the IPFIX header are likely to be lost in the mediation process
   performed by an IPFIX Mediator.  This IP address and Observation
   Domain ID indicate the Observation Point information from the
   viewpoint of the entire network domain.  Such information is
   necessary for guaranteeing the continuity of the work of the top
   level Collector.  Even if an IPFIX Mediator could, with some new
   mechanism, notify Collectors of this Observation Point information,
   older Collectors might not accept it.  These Collectors would then
   wrongly assume that the IP address of the IPFIX Mediator is that of
   the Original Exporter.  The Collector, however, needs to recognize
   the precise Observation Point whether Flow Records go through an
   IPFIX Mediator or not.

   In the following figure, a Collector could identify 2 Exporters with
   IP addresses of 10.1.1.3 and 10.1.1.2, respectively.  The Collector,
   however, needs to somehow recognize Router#1 and Router#2, which are
   the Original Exporters.  Defined notification methods that can be
   interpreted by Collectors and Mediators are thus necessary.

   |IPFIX   |          |IPFIX   |
   |Router#1|--------->|Mediator|---+

Internet-Draft         Mediation Problem Statement        September 2008


5.2.  Loss of Base Time Information

   The Export Time field included in the IPFIX header indicates the base
   time for Flow Records.  In IPFIX Information Elements, described in
   [RFC5102], there are delta time fields that indicate the time
   difference from the value of the Export Time field.  If the Flow
   Records include any delta time fields and the IPFIX Mediator
   overwrites the Export Time field when sending IPFIX messages, the
   delta time fields become meaningless and, because Collectors can not
   recognize this situation, wrong time values are propagated.

5.3.  Loss of Option Template Information

   In some cases, depending on the implementation of the IPFIX
   Mediators, the information that is reported by the Option Templates
   could also be lost.  If, for example, the sampling rate is not
   communicated to the Collectors, a Collector would miscalculate the
   traffic volume.  This might bring crucial problems.  Even if an IPFIX
   Mediator were to simply relay received Option Template Information,
   the value of its scope fields would become meaningless in the context
   of a different session.  It should be noted that the minimal
   information to be communicated by an IPFIX Mediator needs to be
   defined.

5.4.  Observation Domain ID and Template ID Management

   The Observation Domain ID is locally unique to the Exporting Process
   in an IPFIX Mediator, just like the Template ID is unique on the
   basis of the Observation Domain ID.  These renewed identifiers should
   be managed using the Transport Session Information of the Collecting
   Process.  If IPFIX Mediators could not manage the relations among
   these identifiers and the received Transport Session Information, the
   Mediators would, for example, relay wrong values for the scope fields
   of the Option Template and for a "Template Withdraw Message".  In
   most cases, a Collector would not be able to interpret the Template
   ID of a "Template Withdraw Message" and the scope fields of an Option
   Template.  The Collector would then shut down the IPFIX Session.

5.5.  Transport Sessions Management

   How an IPFIX Mediator maintains relationships between the Transport
   Sessions of Collecting Processes and of Exporting Processes depends
   on its implementation.  If multiple Transport Sessions of the
   Collecting Process are relayed to single Transport Session of the
   Exporting Process and the IPFIX Mediators shuts down the Transport
   Session of the Exporting Process, Flow Records on other Transport
   Sessions of the Collecting Processes would not be relayed at all.  In
   the case of resetting a session of the Collecting Process, the

   behavior of the IPFIX Mediator needs to be defined.

6.  Conclusion

   This document has covered the applicability of IPFIX Mediation and a
   multitude of problems related to the implementation of IPFIX
   Mediators.  To assist the ability of the Exporters and Collectors, it
   should be noted that there are various IPFIX Mediation functions for
   the operators to select from.  Examples of the applicability of IPFIX
   Mediation are as follows.

   o  Regarding IPFIX Exporting across domains, IPFIX Masquerading
      Proxies help operators to anonymize or filter Flow Records/Packet
      Reports, preventing privacy violations.

   o  Regarding data retention, IPFIX Mediators enhance the storage of
      the measurement system.

   o  Regarding interoperability, IPFIX Proxies provide interoperability
      between legacy protocols and IPFIX, even during the migration
      period to IPFIX.

   o  Regarding the Flow-based Collector Selection function, in
      integrated networks, which mix MPLS VPN and IPv4/IPv6, this could
      be utilized more frequently.  More sophisticated implementation
      methods would enhance the effectiveness.

   o  Regarding scalability in large-scale networks, IPFIX Concentrators
      or IPFIX Distributors help to achieve high sample rates and fine-
      grained Flow analysis even as networks grow.  As IPFIX Mediation
      functions, Flow selection sampling, aggregation and composition
      are beneficial.

   As a result, the benefits of IPFIX Mediation become apparent.
   However, there are still some open issues.

   o  With the use of IPFIX Mediators, both Observation Point and IPFIX
      header information, such as the Exporter IP address, Observation
      Domain ID, and Export Time field, might be lost.  This data should
      therefore be communicated between the Original Exporter and
      Collector via the IPFIX Mediator.

   o  With the use of IPFIX Mediators, data advertised by Option
      Templates from the Original Exporter, such as the sampling rate
      and sampling algorithm used, might be lost.  If a Collector is not
      informed of current sampling rates, traffic information might
      become worthless.

   o  IPFIX Mediators are required to manage Transport Sessions,
      Template IDs, and Observation Domain IDs.  Otherwise, anomalous

      IPFIX messages could be created.

   These problems stem from the fact that no standards regarding IPFIX
   Mediation have been set.  In particular, the minimum set of
   information which should be communicated between Original Exporters
   and Collectors, interworking between different IPFIX Transport
   Sessions, and the internal components of IPFIX Mediators should be
   standardized.

7.  Security Considerations

   A flow-based measurement system might lead to privacy violations,
   such as the export of Flow Records to an outside address, if the
   system is not confined to the large-scale network under observation.
   General security issues of the IPFIX protocol are covered by the
   security considerations section in [RFC5101].  Security MUST be
   considered if different networks exchange Flow information.  As the
   security of the exchange relies mostly on the protocol used, UDP does
   not seem appropriate for the exchange of information between
   networks.
