           DING Protocol -- A Protocol For Network Management
              draft-irtf-dtnrg-ding-network-management-00

Abstract

   This memo describes the DING (Diagnostic Interplanetary Network
   Gateway) protocol, which is a network management protocol designed
   for use in delay and disruption tolerant networks (DTNs).  The
   protocol is designed to eliminate some of the overhead involved with
   using SNMP to manage hosts on a DTN.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the first version of the Diagnostic
   Interplanetary Network Gateway (DING) communication protocol.  DING
   is a protocol designed to be used for network management in delay
   and/or disruption tolerant networks.  The protocol has been designed
   as a lower-bandwidth alternative to SNMP for use in delay /
   disruption tolerant networks.  DING can be broken down into a number
   of subsections:

   o  Schemas -- Specified in standard ASN.1 format.  Used to describe
      which data to transmit when an update is sent.

   o  Data -- Data sent from one host to another.  Packed as described
      by an associated schema.

   A related RFC describes a gateway that provides SNMP access to
   terrestrial hosts; this RFC only describes the protocol spoken in the
   delayed / disrupted network.

   This is an experimental protocol.  If this protocol is used on the
   Internet, IETF standard protocols for security and congestion control
   should be used.

3.  Service Definitions

   Frame - A chunk of data.

   Schema - Definition of frame fields and types.  ASN.1 representation
   on a host, and a binary-encoded sequence of OIDs when being
   transmitted on the wire.

   Slot - Since this protocol is designed to operate between space
   objects with limited resources, there's the chance that the machine
   might not support an unlimited number of different schemas.  Thus, we
   assign each schema to a "slot".  Each of these slots are spaces meant
   to hold a schema, so by assigning a schema definition to a slot, we
   effectively limit the number of schemas a host will have active at
   once.

   Schema ID - Provides for packets and / or bundles to be delivered out
   of order.  Normally a hash of a frame's schema, but can also be
   integers or equivalent (e.g. in case resources don't allow for hash
   computation).  Can also be used for security (e.g.  HMAC).

4.  Schemas

4.1.  Schema Format

   A schema should be defined on a node in either ASN.1 MIB format (as
   described by RFC 3418) or SMIng format (as described by RFC 3780).
   When sent across the wire, no data should be sent except the OIDs
   corresponding to the data being transmitted; it is assumed that both
   sending and receiving nodes will have matching schemas.  This is
   verified by the "Schema ID" field as described below.

4.2.  Schema Encoding

   When sending a schema, there is some additional information that must
   be included before the schema.  This information as represented as a
   1-byte 'Options' field.  After this field, there is X bytes of
   option-related data (as determined by the value of the 'Options'
   field).  The actual schema follows any data related to the Options
   field.

4.2.1.  Encoding Overview

   A schema encoded into a bundle would look like. . .

                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                   | Options [8 bits]  | Option data...  | Schema...         |
                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                         Figure 1: Encoded Schema

   The schema section of the above would look like. . .

                           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                           | OID | OID | OID | ... |
                           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                          Figure 2: Schema Detail

   Where each "OID" in the above refers to an OID as defined in the
   schema running on the end node.

   The options bits are defined as. . .

                              0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                             |S|U|L|G|R|S|M|E|
                             |C|I|E|Z|M|H|D|X|
                             |H|D|N|P|V|A|5|T|
                             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                             Figure 3: Options

   The bits in the Options field represent the following:

   o  SCH -- Schema bit.  If set, this is a schema definition;
      otherwise, this bundle contains data.

   o  UID -- Schema ID.  If set, the first five bytes of the option data
      comprise a Schema ID.

   o  LEN -- Length bit.  If set, the option data contains an SDNV
      integer (after the Schema ID, if present) which represents the
      length of the schema (in bytes).

   o  GZP -- GZIP bit.  If set, the schema is compressed in the GZIP
      format.

   o  RMV -- Remove bit.  If set, the schema with a given Schema ID will
      be removed.

   o  SHA -- SHA-1 bit.  If set, use SHA-1 to compute the Schema ID.

   o  MD5 -- MD5 bit.  If set, use MD5 to compute the Schema ID.  If
      this option is set, the last byte of the Schema ID should consist
      solely of '0's.

   o  EXT -- Extension bit.  If this bit is set, then the option data
      contains an SDNV integer of value X (after the Schema ID, if
      present, and after the length, if present), followed by X bytes of
      data.  This is to allow the inclusion of additional options,
      should the need arise.

   If the RMV bit is set, the LEN and Schema ID options must also be
   set.  When a host receives a request to remove a schema, it must not
   only ensure that the UIDs match, but also that the length provided in
   the option field matches that of the schema identified by the Schema
   ID.

   Given the nature of DTN, it is a distinct possibility that a request

Internet-Draft           DING Network Management            January 2010


   to remove a schema from a system may arrive before the schema itself.
   Thus, requests for the removal of a schema that does not yet exist
   should be held for some time (as constrained by system resources and
   determined by network link characteristics).

   If a schema is received with a Schema ID that matches the Schema ID
   of a schema already stored, the newest schema may be either stored
   (while waiting for a removal request) or silently discarded.  Note
   that if a schema arrives with a Schema ID and length that matches any
   request for removal currently queued by the system, that schema
   should be immediately discarded.

4.2.2.  Schema Example

   For example, if a satellite has a MIB that associates an OID
   .92.2.3.1 with a thermal sensor, and another OID .92.2.3.2 that
   refers to a battery charge sensor, then a corresponding schema might
   be:

                       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                       | .92.2.3.1   | .92.2.3.2   |
                       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                         Figure 4: Example Schema

   This schema is saying that every update the satellite sends with a
   Schema ID corresponding to that of this schema will contain two data
   values: the data from the thermal sensor and the data from the
   battery charge sensor.

5.  Data Frames

5.1.  Frame Format

   Data sent according to a schema must match the order of and number of
   fields in that schema.

5.2.  Frame Encoding

   When sending a frame, there is some additional information that must
   be included before the frame.  This information is represented as a
   1-byte 'Options' field.  After this field, there is X bytes of
   option-related data (as determined by the value of the 'Options'
   field).  The actual frame follows any data related to the Options
   field.

   A frame encoded into a bundle would look like. . .

           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
           | Options [8 bits]    | Option data...    | Frame...      |
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                          Figure 5: Encoded Frame

   The bits in the Options field represent the following:

   The options bits are defined as. . .

                              0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                             |S|U|L|G|U|U|U|E|
                             |C|I|E|Z|N|N|N|X|
                             |H|D|N|P|U|U|U|T|
                             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                             Figure 6: Options

   o  SCH -- Schema bit.  If set, this is a schema definition;
      otherwise, this bundle contains data.

   o  UID -- Schema ID bit.  If set, the first five bytes of the option
      data comprise a Schema ID.

   o  LEN -- Length bit.  If set, the option data contains an SDNV
      integer (after the Schema ID, if present) which represents the
      length of the schema (in bytes).

Internet-Draft           DING Network Management            January 2010


   o  GZP -- GZIP bit.  If set, the frame is compressed in the GZIP
      format.

   o  EXT -- Extension bit.  If this bit is set, then the option data
      contains an SDNV integer of value X (after the Schema ID, if
      present, and after the length, if present), followed by X bytes of
      data.  This is to allow the inclusion of additional options,
      should the need arise.

   o  UNU -- Unused bit.  The values in any bit marked as UNU should be
      ignored.

5.3.  Frame Example

   To send an update corresponding to the schema defined in the Example
   Schema figure found in section 4, the frame section of the bundle
   would consist of:

                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                   |      255      |      252      |
                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                             Figure 7: Example

   assuming that the thermal and charge sensors reported values of 255
   and 252, respectively.
