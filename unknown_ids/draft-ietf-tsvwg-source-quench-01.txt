Internet-Draft      Deprecation of ICMP Source Quench          June 2011


1.  Introduction

   The ICMP specification [RFC0792] defined the ICMP Source Quench
   message (type 4, code 0), which was meant as a mechanism for
   congestion control.  ICMP Source Quench has been known to be an
   ineffective (and unfair) antidote for congestion, and generation of
   ICMP Source Quench messages by routers has been formally deprecated
   by [RFC1812] since 1995.  However, reaction to ICMP Source Quench
   messages in transport protocols has never been formally deprecated.

   This document formally deprecates reaction to ICMP Source Quench
   messages by transport protocols such as TCP, formally updating
   [RFC0792], [RFC1122], and [RFC1812].  Additionally, it requests that
   the status of [RFC1016] be changed to "Historic".  The rationale for
   these specification updates is:

   o  Processing of ICMP Source Quench messages by routers has been
      deprecated for more than 20 years [RFC1812].

   o  Virtually all popular host implementations have removed support
      for ICMP Source Quench messages since (at least) 2005 [RFC5927].

   o  Widespread deployment of ICMP filtering makes it impossible to
      rely on ICMP Source Quench messages for congestion control.

   o  The IETF has moved away from ICMP Source Quench messages for
      congestion control (note e.g. the development of ECN [RFC3168],
      and the fact that ICMPv6 [RFC4443] does not even specify a Source
      Quench message).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  ICMP Source Quench messages

   The ICMP specification [RFC0792] defined the ICMP Source Quench
   message (type 4, code 0), which was meant to provide a mechanism for
   congestion control.  The Host Requirements RFC [RFC1122] stated in
   Section 4.2.3.9 that hosts MUST react to ICMP Source Quench messages
   by slowing transmission on the connection, and further added that the
   RECOMMENDED procedure was to put the corresponding connection in the
   slow-start phase of TCP's congestion control algorithm [RFC5681].

   [RFC1812] noted that research suggested that ICMP Source Quench was
   an ineffective (and unfair) antidote for congestion, and formally
   deprecated the generation of ICMP Source Quench messages by routers,

Internet-Draft      Deprecation of ICMP Source Quench          June 2011


   stating that routers SHOULD NOT send ICMP Source Quench messages in
   response to congestion.

   [RFC5927] discussed the use of ICMP Source Quench messages for
   performing "blind throughput-reduction" attacks, and noted that most
   TCP implementations silently ignore ICMP Source Quench messages.

   We note that TCP implements its own congestion control mechanisms
   [RFC5681] [RFC3168], that do not depend on ICMP Source Quench
   messages.

      It is interesting to note that ICMPv6 [RFC4443] does not specify a
      "Source Quench" message.


3.  Updating RFC 1122

   This document hereby updates Section 3.2.2.3 of [RFC1122] as follows:

      A host SHOULD NOT send ICMP Source Quench messages.

      If a Source Quench message is received, the IP layer MAY silently
      discard it.

   Section 4.2.3.9 of [RFC1122] is updated as follows:

      TCP SHOULD silently discard any received ICMP Source Quench
      messages.


4.  Updating RFC 1812

   This document hereby updates Section 4.3.3.3 of [RFC1812] as follows:

      A router SHOULD ignore any ICMP Source Quench messages it
      receives.


5.  General Advice to Transport Protocols

   If a Source Quench message is received by a transport-protocol
   instance (e.g., a TCP connection), it SHOULD be silently ignored.


6.  Changing the status of RFC 1016 to Historic

   This document requests the RFC Editor to change the status of
   [RFC1016] to "Historic".

7.  Security Considerations

   ICMP Source Quench messages could be leveraged for performing blind
   throughput-reduction attacks against TCP and similar protocols.  This
   attack vector, along with possible countermeasures, have been
   discussed in great detail in [RFC5927] and [CPNI-TCP].  However, as
   noted in [RFC5927] and [CPNI-TCP], virtually all current versions of
   popular TCP implementations already silently ignore ICMP Source
   Quench messages.

   Silently ignoring ICMP Source Quench messages, as specified in this
   document, eliminates the aforementioned attack vector.

   If deemed necessary, ICMP Source Quench messages could be filtered at
   firewalls.


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to mark ICMP type 4 (Source Quench) as "Deprecated"
   in de ICMP Parameters registry [ICMPPARREG] with a reference to this
   document.

Appendix A.  Survey of support of ICMP Source Quench in some popular
             TCP/IP implementations

   A large number of implementations completely ignore ICMP Source
   Quench messages meant for TCP connections.  This behavior has been
   implemented in, at least, Linux [Linux] since 2004, and in FreeBSD
   [FreeBSD], NetBSD [NetBSD], OpenBSD [OpenBSD], and Solaris 10 since
   2005.  Additionally, OpenSolaris [OpenSolaris] has always shipped
   with support for ICMP Source Quench messages disabled.

      messages (as suggested by Anantha Ramaiah).
