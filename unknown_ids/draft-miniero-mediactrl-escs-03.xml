	<!-- Overview -->
	<section title="Overview" anchor="sec-overview">
		<t>
			This document provides with a list of more or less detailed MEDIACTRL
			Media Control Channel Framework
			<xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework"/> call flows.
			The motivation for this comes from our implementation experience
			with the framework and its protocol. This drove us to writing what
			could be both a simple guide throughout the use of the several interfaces
			between Application Servers and MEDIACTRL-based Media Servers (and the
			related correlations between them) and a hopefully helpful base reference
			documentation for other implementors and protocol researchers.
		</t>
		<t>
			Following this spirit, this document covers several aspects of the
			interaction between Application Servers and Media Servers. However, in the
			context of this document, the call flows almost always depict the interaction
			between a single Application Server (which, for the sake of conciseness,
			is called AS from now on) and a single Media Server (MS). To ease up the understanding
			of all the flows (for what concerns both SIP dialogs and CFW transactions),
			the domains hosting the AS and the MS in all the scenarios are called,
			respectively, 'cicciopernacchio.com' and 'pippozzoserver.org'.
		</t>
		<t>
			In the next paragraphs a small overview of our implementation approaches
			and choices is described, with particular focus upon the protocol-related
			aspects. This involves state diagrams for what concerns both the client side
			(the AS) and the server side (the MS). Of course, this section is not at all to be
			considered a mandatory approach to the implementation of the framework. It
			is only meant to ease up the understanding of how the framework works from
			a practical point of view, and of the following examples.
		</t>
		<t>
			Once done with this preliminary considerations, in the subsequent sections
			real-life scenarios are faced. In this context, first of all, the establishment
			of the Control Channel is dealt with: after that, some typical use case
			scenarios, involving the most typical multimedia applications, are depicted
			and described.
		</t>
		<section title="A Practical Approach" anchor="sec-overview-implementation">
			<t>
				TBD. (What exactly is needed here? Implementation detail are not likely
				to belong in here...)
			</t>
			<section title="State Diagrams" anchor="sec-overview-state">
				<t>
					TBD. (talk about both diagrams; explain why both diagrams have been
					separated considering the introduction of the new MS-generated CONTROL
					event for notifications; describe how transactions and events are
					correlated at package level, but not at framework level).

	<section title="Control Channel Establishment" anchor="sec-comedia">
		<t>
			As specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework"/>,
			the preliminary step to any interaction between
			an AS and a MS is the establishment of a control
			channel between the two. As explained in the next
			subsection, this is accomplished by
			means of a so-called COMEDIA <xref target="RFC4145"/>
			negotiation. This negotiation allows for a TCP
			connection to be created between the AS and the MS:
			once they have connected, a SYNC message sent
			by the AS to the MS consolidates the control channel.

		<section title="COMEDIA Negotiation" anchor="sec-comedia-neg">
			<t>
				As a first step, the AS and the MS establish a
				Control SIP dialog. This is usually originated
				by the AS itself. The AS generates a SIP
				INVITE message containing in its SDP body
				information about the TCP connection it wants
				to establish with the MS. In the provided
				example (see <xref target="fig-comedia"/>
				and the attached call flow), the AS wants
				to actively open a new TCP connection, which
				on his side will be bound to port 5757.
				If the request is fine, the MS answers
				with its own offer, by communicating to the
				AS the transport address to connect to in
				order to establish the TCP connection.
				In the provided example, the MS will listen
				on the port 7575. Once this negotiation
				is over, the AS can effectively connect
				to the MS.
			</t>
			<t>
				The negotiation includes additional attributes,
				the most important being the 'cfw-id' attribute,
				since it specifies the Dialog-ID which will be
				subsequently referred to by both the AS and the
				MS, as specified in the core framework draft.
			</t>
			<t>
				Note that the provided example also includes
				the indication, from both the AS and the MS,
				of the supported control packages. This is
				achieved by means of a series of 'ctrl-package'
				attributes as specified in
				<xref target="I-D.boulton-mmusic-sdp-control-package-attribute"/>.
				In the example, the AS supports (or is only
				interested to) two packages: IVR and
				the Audio Conferencing. The MS replies with
				the list of packages it supports, by adding
				the VoiceXML IVR package to the list provided
				by the AS. It is worth noting that this exchange
				of information is not meant as a strictly containing
				negotiation of packages: in case the AS gets to
				know that one or more packages it needs are not
				supported according to the indications sent by
				the MS, it MAY choose not to open a control channel
				with the MS at all, if its application logic leads
				to such a decision. The actual negotiation of control
				packages is done subsequenty through the use of
				the framework SYNC transaction.

				Once the AS and the MS have successfully
				established a TCP connection, an additional
				step is needed before the control channel
				can be used. In fact, as seen in the previous
				subsection, the first interaction between
				the AS and the MS happens by means of a
				SIP dialog, which in turns allows for the
				creation of the TCP connection. This
				introduces the need for a proper correlation
				between the above mentioned SIP dialog and
				TCP connection, so that the MS can be sure
				the connection came from the AS which
				requested it. This is accomplished by
				means of a dedicated framework message
				called SYNC. This SYNC message makes
				use of a unique identifier called Dialog-ID
				to validate the control channel. This identifier,
				as introduced in the previous paragrah, is
				randomly generated by the caller (the AS in the
				call flow), and added as an SDP media attribute
				(cfw-id) to the COMEDIA negotiation in order
				to make both the entities aware of its value:

							]]>
					</artwork>
				</figure>
		        </t><t>
				Besides, it offers an
				additional negotiation mechanism.
				In fact, the AS uses the SYNC not only
				to properly correlate as explained before,
				but also to negotiate with the MS the
				control packages it is interested to,
				as well as to agree on a Keep-Alive timer
				needed by both the AS and the MS to
				understand if problems on the connection
				occur. In the provided example (see
				<xref target="fig-comedia"/> and the related
				call flow), the AS sends a SYNC with a
				Dialog-ID constructed as needed (using the
				'cfw-id' attribute from the SIP dialog)
				and requests access to two control packages,
				specifically the IVR and the Audio Conferencing
				package (These are the same packages the AS previously
				indicated in its SDP as specified in
				<xref target="I-D.boulton-mmusic-sdp-control-package-attribute"/>,
				with the difference that this time they are
				reported in the context of a binding negotiation).
				Besides, it instructs the MS that a 100 seconds timeout
				is to be used for Keep-Alive messages. The MS
				validates the request by matching the
				received Dialog-ID with the SIP dialog
				values and, assuming it supports the
				control packages the AS requested access to
				(and for the sake of this document we assume
				it does), it answers with a 200 message.
				Additionally, the MS provides the AS with
				a list of other unrequested packages it supports (in this
				case the VoiceXML IVR package and a dummy package providing
				testing functionality).

			Note well: this is only an example of a possible approach involving
			a 3PCC negotiation among the UAC, the AS and the MS, and as such is
			not at all to be considered as the mandatory way or as best common
			practice either in the presented scenario. <xref target="RFC3725"/> provides several
			different solutions and many details about how 3PCC can be realized,
			with pros and cons.			
		</t>
		<t>
			The UAC first places a call to a SIP URI the AS is responsible of.
			The specific URI is not relevant to the examples, since the application
			logic behind the mapping between a URI and the service it provides
			is a matter that is important only to the AS: so, a generic
			&apos;sip:example@cicciopernacchio.com&apos; is used in all the examples, whereas
			the service this URI is associated with in the AS logic is mapped
			scenario by scenario to the case under exam. The UAC INVITE is treated
			as envisaged in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-architecture"/>: the
			INVITE is forwarded by the AS to the MS in a 3PCC fashion, without the SDP
			provided by the UAC being touched, thus to have the session fully negotiated
			by the MS for what concerns its description. The MS matches the UAC's offer
			with its own capabilities and provides its answer in a 200 OK. This answer
			is then forwarded, again without the SDP contents being touched, by the
			AS to the UAC it is intended for. This way, while the SIP signaling from
			the UAC is terminated to the AS, all the media would start directly flowing
			between the UAC and the MS.
		</t>
		<t>
			As a consequence of this negotiation, one or more media connections are
			created between the MS and the UAC. They are then addressed, when needed,
			by the AS and the MS by means of the tags concatenation as specified in
			<xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework"/>. How the identifiers
			are created and addressed is explained by making use of the sample signaling
			provided in <xref target="fig-uac2as2ms-sip"/>.

				<t>

					MS as an announcement:
				</t>
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>The AS, as a second transaction, invokes a playout on the UAC
							connection by means of a new CONTROL request (C1); the body is once againg
							for the IVR package (msc-ivr/1.0), but this time it
							requests the start (dialogstart) of a new announcement context
							(&lt;prompt&gt;); the file to be played is the one
							recorded before (prompts), and has only to be played once (iterations);</t>
						<t>Again, the usual provisional 202 (C2), the subsequent REPORT update (C3),
							and its ack (C4) from the AS take place;</t>
						<t>In the meanwhile, the MS prepares the new dialog and starts it, notifying the
							AS about it with a new REPORT (C5) with a terminated status: the connection
							is then passed to the IVR package, which plays the file on it;</t>
						<t>The AS acks the terminating REPORT (C6), now waiting for the announcement to end;</t>
						<t>Once the playout is over, the MS sends a CONTROL event (D1) which
							contains in its body (&lt;promptinfo&gt;) information about
							the just concluded announcement; as before, the proper dialogid is
							used as a reference to the correct dialog;</t>
						<t>The AS concludes this second and last transaction by acking the
							CONTROL event (D2).</t>

			<t>
				Another scenario that might involve the interaction between an AS and a MS
				is the classic phone call between two UACs. In fact, even though the most
				straightforward way to achieve this would be to let the UACs negotiate
				the session and the media to make use of between themselves, there are
				cases when the services provided by a MS might come in handy for phone
				calls as well.
			</t>
			<t>
				One of these cases is when the two UACs have no common supported codecs:
				having the two UACs directly negotiate the session would result in a
				session with no available media. Involving the MS as a transcoder would
				instead allow the two UACs to communicate anyway. Another interesting
				case is when the AS (or any other entity the AS is working in behalf of)
				is interested in manipulating or monitoring the media session between
				the UACs, e.g. to record the conversation: a similar scenario will be
				dealt with in <xref target="sec-call-conf"/>.
			</t>
			<t>
				Before proceeding in looking at how such a scenario might be accomplished
				by means of the Media Control Channel Framework, it is worth spending a couple of
				words upon how the SIP signaling involving all the interested parties
				might look like. In fact in such a scenario a 3PCC approach is absolutely
				needed. An example is provided in <xref target="fig-call-3pcc"/>. Again, the
				presented example is not at all to be considered best common practice when
				3PCC is needed in a MediaCtrl-based framework. It is only described in order
				to let the reader more easily understand what are the requirements on the
				MS side, and as a consequence which information might be required.
				<xref target="RFC3725"/> provides with a much more detailed overview on
				3PCC patterns in several use cases. Only an explainatory sequence diagram
				is provided, without delving into the details of the exchanged SIP messages.

				In the example, the UAC1 wants to place a phone call to UAC2. To do so,
				it sends an INVITE to the AS with its offer A. The AS sends an offerless
				INVITE to UAC2. When the UAC2 responds with a 180, the same message is
				forwarded by the AS to the UAC1 to notify it the callee is ringing. In
				the meanwhile, the AS also adds a leg to the MS for UAC1, as explained
				in the previous sections: to do so it of course makes use of the offer A
				the UAC1 made. Once the UAC2 accepts the call, by providing its own offer
				B in the 200, the AS adds a leg for it too to the MS. At this point,
				the negotiation can be completed by providing the two UACs with the
				SDP answer negotiated by the MS with them (A' and B' respectively).
			</t>
			<t>
				This is only one way to deal with the signaling, and shall not absolutely
				be considered as a mandatory approach of course.
			</t>
			<t>
				Once the negotiation is over, the two UACs are not in communication yet.
				In fact, it's up to the AS now to actively trigger the MS into attaching
				their media streams to each other someway, by referring to the connection
				identifiers associated with the UACs as explained previously. This document
				presents two different approaches that might be followed, according to what
				needs to be accomplished. A generic media perspective of the phone call
				scenario is depicted in <xref target="fig-call-rtp"/>: the MS is
				basically in the media path between the two UACs.

					The framework transactions needed to accomplish this

					of two different UACs, i.e. UAC1 and UAC2. This means
					that, in this transaction, id1 and i2 will have to
					address the media connections of UAC1 and UAC2. In case
					of a successful transaction, the MS takes care of forwarding
					all media coming from UAC1 to UAC2 and vice versa, transparently
					taking care of any required transcoding steps, if necessary.

					Such a simple approach has its drawbacks. For instance, with such
					an approach recording a conversation between two users might be
					tricky to accomplish. In fact, since no mixing would be involved,
					only the single connections (UAC1&lt;-&gt;MS and UAC2&lt;-&gt;MS)
					could be recorded. If the AS wants a conversation recording service
					to be provided anyway, it needs additional business logic on its side.
					An example of such a use case is provided in <xref target="sec-call-record"/>.

			<section title="Conference-based Approach" anchor="sec-call-conf">
				<t>
					The approach described in <xref target="sec-call-direct"/> surely works for
					a basic phone call, but as already explained might have some drawbacks whenever
					more advanced features were needed.
					For intance, you can't record the whole conversation, only the single connections, since
					no mixing is involved. Besides, even the single task of playing an announcement over
					the conversation could be complex, especially if the MS does not support implicit mixing
					over media connections. For this reason, in more advanced cases a different approach
					might be taken, like the conference-based approach described in this section.
				</t>
				<t>
					The idea is to make use of a mixing entity in the MS that acts as a bridge between
					the two UACs: the presence of this entity allows for more
					customization on what needs to be done on the conversation, like the recording
					of the conversation that has been provided as example. The approach is
					depicted in <xref target="fig-call-conf"/>. The mixing functionality in the MS
					will be described in more detail in the following section (which deals with many
					conference-related scenarios), so only some hints will be provided here for
					a basic comprehension of the approach.

					The AS makes use of two different packages to accomplish
					this scenario: the mixer package (to create the mixing
					entity and join the UACs) and the IVR package (to record
					what happens in the conference). The framework transaction
					steps can be described as follows:
				</t>
				<t>
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>First of all, the AS creates a new hidden conference
					by means of a 'createconference' request (A1); this conference
					is properly configured according to the use it is assigned to;
					in fact, since only two participants will be joined to it, both
					'reserved-talkers' and 'reserved-listeners' are set to 2; besides,
					the video layout as well is set accordingly (single-view/dual-view);</t>
					<t>the MS notifies the successful creation of the new conference in
					a 200 framework message (A2); the identifier assigned to the conference,
					which will be used in subsequent request addressed to it, is 6013f1e;</t>
					<t>the AS requests a new recording upon the newly created conference; to
					do so, it places a proper request to the IVR package (B1); the AS is
					interested in a video recording (type=video/mpeg), which must not last
					longer than 3 hours (maxtime=1800s), after which the recording must end;
					besides, no beep must be played on the conference (beep=false), and the recording
					must start immediately whether or not any audio activity has been reported
					(vadinitial=false);</t>
					<t>the transaction is extended by the MS (B3), and when the dialog has been
					successfully started, a REPORT terminate is issued to the AS (B4); the message
					contains the dialogid associated with the dialog (00b29fb), which the AS
					must refer to for later notifications;</t>
					<t>at this point, the AS attaches both the UACs to the conference with two
					separate 'join' directives (C1/D1); when the MS confirms the success of both
					the operations (C2/D2), the two UACs are actually in contact with each other
					(even though indirectly, since a hidden conference they're unaware of is on
					their path) and their media contribution is recorded.</t>

				<t>The recording of the conversation can subsequently be accessed by the AS by waiting

				has reached its programmed 3 hours) or by any interruption of the dialog itself (e.g. the
				AS actively requested the recording to be interrupted since the call between the UACs ended).</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Recording a conversation" anchor="sec-call-record">
				<t>
					The previous section described how to take advantage of the conferencing
					functionality of the mixer package in order to allow the recording of
					phone calls in a simple way. However, making use of a dedicated mixer
					just for a phone call might be considered overkill. This section shows
					how recording a conversation and playing it out subsequently can be
					accomplished without a mixing entity involved in the call, that is by using the
					direct connection approach as described in <xref target="sec-call-direct"/>.
				</t>
				<t>
					As already explained previously, in case the AS wants to record a phone call
					between two UACs, the use of just the &lt;join&gt; directive without a mixer
					forces the AS to just rely on separate recording commands. That is, the
					AS can only instruct the MS to separately record the media flowing on each
					media leg: a recording for all the media coming from UAC1, and a different
					recording for all the media coming from UAC2. In case someone wants to access
					the whole conversation subsequently, the AS may take at least two different
					approaches:
				</t>
				<t>
					<list style="numbers">
						<t>
							it may mix the two recordings itself (e.g. by delegating it to an
							offline mixing entity) in order to obtain a single file containing the
							combination of thw two recordings; this way, a simple playout
							as described in section <xref target="sec-echo-recording"/> would
							suffice;
						</t>
						<t>
							alternatively, it may take advantage of the mixing functionality
							provided by the MS itself; a way to do so is to create a hidden
							conference on the MS, attach the UAC as a passive participant
							to it, and play the separate recordings on the conference as
							announcements; this way, the UAC accessing the recording would
							experience both the recordings at the same time.
						</t>
					</list>
				</t>
				<t>
					It is of course option 2 that is considered in this section. The framework
					transaction as described in <xref target="fig-call-record"/> assumes that
					a recording has already been requested for both UAC1 and UAC2, that the
					phone call has ended and that the AS has successfully received the URIs
					to both the recordings from the MS. Such steps are not described again
					since they would be quite similar to the ones described in
					<xref target="sec-echo-recording"/>. As anticipated, the idea is to make
					use of a properly constructed hidden conference to mix the two separate
					recordings on the fly and present them to the UAC. It is of course up to
					the AS to subsequently unjoin the user from the conference and destroy
					the conference itself once the playout of the recordings ends for any reason.

					The diagram above assumes a recording of both the channels has already taken
					place. It may have been requested by the AS either shortly before joining UAC1
					and UAC2, or shortly after that transaction. Whenever that happened, a recording
					is assumed to have taken place, and so the AS is supposed to have both the
					recordings available for playback. Once a new user, UAC, wants to access the
					recorded conversation, the AS takes care of the presented transactions.
					The framework transaction steps are only apparently more complicated than
					the ones presented so far. The only difference, in fact, is that transactions
					C and D are concurrent, since the recordings must be played together.
				</t>
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>First of all, the AS creates a new conference to act as a mixing entity (A1); the
						settings for the conference are chosen according to the use case, e.g. the video layout
						which is fixed to 'dual-view' and the switching type to 'controller'; when the conference
						has been successfully created (A2) the AS takes note of the conference identifier;</t>
						<t>At this point, the UAC is attached to the conference as a passive user (B1); there would
						be no point in letting the user contribute to the conference mix, since he will only
						need to watch a recording; in order to specify his passive status, both the audio
						and video streams for the user are set to 'recvonly'; in case the transaction succeeds,
						the MS notifies it to the MS (B2);</t>
						<t>Once the conference has been created and UAC has been attached to it, the AS can request
						the playout of the recordings; in order to do so, it requests two concurrent &lt;prompt&gT;
						directives (C1 and D1), addressing respectively the recording of UAC1 and UAC2; both the
						prompts must be played on the previously created conference and not to UAC directly, as
						can be evinced from the 'conferenceid' attribute of the &l;dialog&gt; element;</t>
						<t>The transactions live their life exactly as explained for previous &lt;prompt&gt;
						examples; the originating transactions are first prepared and started (C2-6, D2-6),
						and then, as soon as any of the playout ends, a realted CONTROL message to notify
						this is triggered by the MS (E1, F1); the notification may contain a &lt;promptinfo&gt;
						element with information about how the playout proceeded (e.g. whether the playout
						completed normally, or interrupted by a DTMF tone, etc.).</t>

			<t>
				Another application that typically makes use of the
				services a MS can provide is Voice Mail. In fact, while
				it is clear that many of its features are part of the
				application logic (e.g. the mapping of a URI with a
				specific user's voice mailbox, the list of messages
				and their properties, and so on), the actual media
				work is accomplished through the MS. Features needed
				by a VoiceMail application include the ability to
				record a stream and play it back anytime later,
				give verbose announcements regarding the status
				of the application, controlling the playout of
				recorded messages by means of VCR controls and so
				on, all features which are supported by the MS
				through the IVR package.
			</t>
			<t>
				Without delving into the details of a full VoiceMail
				application and all its possible use cases, this section
				will cover a specific scenario, trying to deal with
				as many as possible interactions that may happen
				between the AS and the MS in such a context. The
				covered scenario, depicted as a sequence diagram
				in <xref target="fig-voicemail-scfw"/>, will be the following:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="numbers">
					<t>The UAC INVITEs a URI associated with his mailbox, and the AS follows
						the already explained procedure to have the UAC negotiate a new
						media session with the MS;</t>
					<t>The UAC is first prompted an announcement giving him a count of the
						available new messages in the mailbox, and the date and time
						the last message has been received; after that, the UAC must choose
						which message to access by sending a DTMF tone;</t>
					<t>The UAC is then presented with a VCR controlled announcement, in which
						the chosen received mail is played back to him; VCR controls allow
						him to navigate through the prompt.</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>This is a quite oversimplified scenario, considering it doesn't even allow the UAC
				to delete old messages, organize them and the like, but just to choose which received
				message to play. Nevertheless, it gives us the chance
				to deal with variable announcements and VCR controls, two typical features a
				Voice Mail application would almost always take advantage of. Besides, other
				features a Voice Mail application would rely upon (e.g. recording streams,
				event driven IVR menus and so on) have aready been introduced in previous
				sections, and so representing them would be redundant.

				The framework transaction steps are described in the following
				lines:
			</t>
			<t>
			<list style="symbols">
				<t>The first transaction (A1) is addressed to the IVR package (msc-ivr); it is basically
				a 'promptandcollect' dialog, but with a slight difference: some of the prompts to
				play are actual audio files, for which a URI is provided (media src="xxx"), while
				others are so-called 'variable' prompts; these 'variable' prompts are actually
				constructed by the MS itself according to the directives provided by the AS; in this
				example, this is the sequence of prompts that is requested by the AS:
				<list style="numbers">
					<t>play a wav file ("you have...");</t>
					<t>play a digit ("five..."), by building it (variable: digit=5);</t>
					<t>play a wav file ("messages...");</t>
					<t>play a wav file ("last...");</t>
					<t>play a wav file ("received...");</t>
					<t>play a date ("13th of october 2008..."), by building it (variable: date with a ymd=year/month/day format);</t>
					<t>play a wav file ("at...");</t>
					<t>play a time ("13:38..."), by building it (variable: time with a t24=24 hour day format);</t>
					<t>play a wav file ("o' clock...");</t>
				</list>
				a DTMF collection is requested as well (&lt;collect&gt;) to be taken after the prompts have
				been played; the AS is only interested to a single digit (maxdigits=1);
				</t>
				<t>the transaction is extended by the MS (A2, A3, A4) and, in case everything went fine (i.e. the
				MS retrieved all the audio files and successfully built the variable ones), the dialog is started;
				its start is reported, together with the associated identifier (5db01f4) to the AS in a
				terminating REPORT message (A5);</t>
				<t>the AS acks the REPORT (A6), and waits for the dialog to end in order to retrieve the results
				it is interested to (in this case, the DTMF tone the UAC chooses, since it will affect which
				message will have to be played subsequently);</t>
				<t>the UAC hears the prompts and chooses a message to play; in this example, he wants to listen
				to the first message, and so digits 1; the MS intercepts this tone, and notifies it to the AS in
				a newly created CONTROL event message (B1); this CONTROL includes information about how each
				single requested operations ended (&lt;promptinfo&gt; and &lt;collectinfo&gt;); specifically,
				the event states that the prompt ended normally (termmode=completed) and that the subsequently
				collected tone is 1 (dtmf=1); the AS acks the event (B2), since the dialogid provided in
				the message is the same as the one of the previously started dialog;</t>
				<t>at this point, the AS makes use of the value retrieved from the event to proceed in its
				business logic; it decides to present the UAC with a VCR-controllable playout of the
				requested message; this is done with a new request to the IVR package (C1), which contains
				two operations: &lt;prompt&gt; to address the media file to play (an old recording), and
				&lt;control&gt; to instruct the MS about how the playout of this media file shall be
				controlled via DTMF tones provided by the UAC (in this example, different DTMF digits are
				associated with different actions, e.g. pause/resume, fast forward, rewind and so on); besides,
				the AS also subscribes to DTMF events related to this control operation (matchmode=control),
				which means that the MS is to trigger an event anytime a DTMF associated with a control
				operation (e.g. 7=pause) is intercepted;</t>
				<t>the MS prepares the dialog, notifying about the transaction being extended (C2, C3, C4) and,
				when the playout starts, notifies it in a terminating REPORT (C5), which is acked by the AS (C6);
				at this point, the UAC is presented with the prompt, and can make use of DTMF digits to control
				the playback;</t>
				<t>as explained previously, any DTMF associated with a VCR operation is then reported to the AS,
				together with a timestamp stating when the event happened; an example is provided (D1)
				in which the UAC pressed the fast forward key (6) at a specific time; of course, as for any
				other MS-generated event, the AS acks it (D2);</t>
				<t>when the playback ends (whether because the media reached its termination, or because any
				other interruption occurred), the MS triggers a concluding event with information about the
				whole dialog (E1); this event, besides including information about the prompt itself (&lt;promptinfo&gt;),
				also includes information related to the VCR operations (&lt;controlinfo&gt;), that is, all the
				VCR controls the UAC made use of (in the example fastforward/rewind/pause/resume) and
				when it happened; the final ack by the AS (E2) concludes the scenario.</t>

				One of the most important services the MS must be able to provide is mixing. This
				involves mixing media streams from different sources, and delivering the resulting
				mix(es) to each interested party, often according to per-user policies, settings
				and encoding. A typical scenario involving mixing is of course media conferencing.
				In such a scenario, the media sent by each participant is mixed, and each participant
				typically receives the overall mix excluding its own contribtion and encoded in
				the format it negotiated. This example points out in a quite clear way how mixing
				must take care of the profile of each involved entity.

				The next subsections will cover several typical scenarios involving mixing and
				conferencing as a whole, specifically:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="numbers">
					<t>Simple Bridging, where the scenario will be a very basic (i.e. no &quot;special effects&quot;,
						just mixing involved) conference between two and more participants;</t>
					<t>Rich Conference Scenario, which enriches the Simple Bridging scenario by adding additional
						features typically found in conferencing systems (e.g. DTMF collection for PIN-based conference
						access, private and global announcements, recordings and so on);</t>
					<t>Coaching Scenario, a more complex scenario which involves per-user mixing (cusomers, agents
						and coaches don't get all the same mixes);</t>
					<t>Sidebars Scenario, which adds more complexity to the previous conferencing scenarios by
						involving sidebars (i.e. separate conference instances that only exist within the
						context of a parent conference instance) and the custom media delivery that follows.</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>
				All the above mentioned scenarios depend on the availability of a mixing entity. Such an
				entity is provided in the Media Control Channel Framework by the conferencing package. This package
				in fact, besides allowing for the joining of media sources between each other as seen in the
				Direct Echo Test section, enables the creation of abstract connections that can be joined to
				multiple connections: these abstract connections, called conferences, mix the contribution
				of each attached connection and feed them accordingly (e.g. a connection with 'sendrecv' property
				would be able to contribute to the mix and to listen to it, while a connection with a
				'recvonly' property would only be able to listen to the overall mix but not to actively
				contribute to it).
			</t>
			<t>
				That said, each of the above mentioned scenarios will start more or less in the same way: by the
				creation of a conference connection (or more than one, as needed in some cases) to be
				subsequently referred to when it comes to mixing. A typical framework transaction to
				crete a new conference instance in the Media Control Channel Framework is depicted in
				<xref target="fig-conf-common-scfw"/>:

			<t>
				The call flow is quite straightforward, and can typically be summarized in the following steps:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>The AS invokes the creation of a new conference instance by means of a CONTROL
					request (1); this request is addressed to the conferencing package (msc-mixer/1.0)
					and contains in the body the directive (createconference) with all the desired
					settings for it; in the example, the mixing policy is to mix the five (reserved-talkers)
					loudest speakers (nbest), while ten listeners at max are allowed; video settings are configured,
					including the mechanism used to select active video sources (controller, meaning the AS will
					explicitly instruct the MS about it) and details about the video layouts to make available; in this
					example, the AS is instructing the MS to use a single-view layout when only one video source is active,
					to pass to a quad-view layout when at least two video sources are active, and to use a 5x1 layout whenever
					the number of sources is at least five; finally, the AS also
					subscribes to the &quot;active-talkers&quot; event, which means it wants to be informed
					(at a rate of 4 seconds) whenever an active participant is speaking;</t>
					<t>The MS creates the conference instance assigning a unique identifier to it
						(6146dd5), and completes the transaction with a 200 response (2);</t>
					<t>At this point, the requested conference instance is active and ready to be used
						by the AS; it is then up to the AS to integrate the use of this identifier
						in its application logic.</t>

					As already introduced before, the simplest use an AS can make of a
					conference instance is simple bridging. In this scenario, the conference
					instance just acts as a bridge for all the participants that are attached
					to it. The bridge takes care of transcoding, if needed (in general,
					different participants may make use of different codecs for their streams),
					echo cancellation (each participant will receive the overall mix excluding
					their own contribution) and per-participant mixing (each participant may
					receive different mixed streams, according to what it needs/is allowed to
					send/receive). This assumes of course that each interested participant
					must be joined somehow to the bridge in order to indirectly communicate
					with the other paricipants. From the media perspective, the scenario
					can be seen as depicted in <xref target="fig-conf-simple"/>.

					In the framework, the first step is obviously to create a new conference
					instance as seen in the introductory section (<xref target="fig-conf-common-scfw"/>).
					Assuming a conference instance has already been created, bridging participants to
					it is quite straightforward, and can be accomplished as already seen in the
					Direct Echo Test Scenario: the only difference here is that each participant
					is not directly connected to itself (Direct Echo) or another UAC (Direct Connection)
					but to the bridge instead. <xref target="fig-conf-simple1-scfw"/> shows the
					example of two different UACs joining the same conference: the example, as usual, hides the
					previous interaction between each of the two UACs and the AS, and instead focuses
					on what the AS does to actually join the participants to the bridge so that
					they can interact in a conference.

					The framework transaction steps are actually quite trivial to
					understand, since they're very similar to some previously described
					scenarios. What the AS does is just joining both UAC1 (id1 in A1)
					and UAC2 (id1 in B1) to the conference (id2 in both transactions).
					As a result of these two operations, both the UACs are mixed
					in the conference. Since no &lt;stream&gt; is explicitly provided
					in any of the transactions, all the media from the UACs (audio/video)
					are attached to the conference (as long as the conference has been
					properly configured to support both, of course).

					The directive used to modify an existing join configuration
					is &lt;modifyjoin&gt;, and its syntax is exactly the same
					as the one required in &lt;join&gt; instructions. In fact,
					the same syntax is used for identifiers (id1/id2). Whenever
					a modifyjoin is requested and id1 and id2 address one or
					more joined connections, the AS is requesting a change of
					the join configuration. In this case, the AS instructs the MS
					to mute (stream=audio, direction=recvonly) UAC1 (id1=UAC1)
					in the conference (id2) it has been attached to previously.
					Any other connection existing between them is left untouched.

					The previous scenario can be enriched with additional features often

					and recording of the whole conference), private and global announcements and so
					on. All of this can be achieved by means of the functionality provided by the MS.

					As it can be evinced from the sequence diagram above, the AS, in
					its business logic, correlates the results of different transactions,
					addressed to different packages, to implement a more complex
					conferencing scenario than the Simple Bridging previously described.
					The framework transaction steps are the following:
				</t>
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>Since this is a private conference, the UAC is to be presented with
						a request for a password, in this case a PIN number; to do so, the AS
						instructs the MS (A1) to collect a series of DTMF digits from the specified
						UAC (connectionid=UAC); the request includes both a voice message (&lt;prompt&gt;)
						and the described digit collection context (&lt;collect&gt;); the PIN is assumed
						to be a 4-digit number, and so the MS has to collect at max 4 digits (maxdigits=4);
						the DTMF digit buffer must be cleared before collecting (cleardigitbuffer=true) and
						the UAC can make use of the star key to restart the collection (escapekey=*), e.g.
						in case it is aware he miswrote any of the digits and wants to start again;</t>
						<t>the transaction goes on as usual (A2, A3, A4, A5, A6), with the transaction
						being extended, and the dialog start being notified in a REPORT terminate; after
						that, the UAC is actually presented with the voice message, and is subsequently
						requested to insert the required PIN number;</t>
						<t>we assume UAC wrote the correct PIN number (1234), which is reported by the MS
						to the AS by means of the usual MS-generated CONTROL event (B1); the AS correlates
						this event to the previously started dialog by checking the referenced dialogid
						(06d1bac) and acks the event (B2); it then extracts the information it needs from
						the event (in this case, the digits provided by the MS) from the &lt;controlinfo&gt;
						container (dtmf=1234) and verifies it is correct;</t>
						<t>since the PIN is correct, the AS can proceed towards the next step, that is
						asking the UAC to state his name, in order to play the recording subsequently
						on the conference to report the new participant; again, this is done with a
						request to the IVR package (C1); the AS instructs the MS to play a voice message
						("say your name after the beep"), to be followed by a recording of only the audio
						from the UAC (in stream, media=audio/sendonly, while media=video/inactive); a beep
						must be played right before the recording starts (beep=true), and the recording
						must only last 3 seconds (maxtime=3s) since it is only needed as a brief announcement;</t>
						<t>without delving again into the details of a recording-related transaction (C2/C3/C4/C5/C6),
						the AS finally gets an URI to the requested recording (D1, acked in D2);</t>
						<t>at this point, the AS attaches the UAC (id1) to the conference (id2) just as explained for
						Simple Bridging (E1/E2);</t>
						<t>finally, to notify the other participants that a new participant has arrived, the AS
						requests a global announcement on the conference; this is a simple &lt;prompt&gt; request
						to the IVR package (F1) just as the ones explained in previous sections, but with
						a slight difference: the target of the prompt is not a connectionid (a media connection)
						but the conference itself (conferenceid=6146dd5); as a result of this transaction, the
						announcement would be played on all the media connections attached to the conference
						which are allowed to receive media from it; the AS specifically requests two media files
						to be played:
						<list style="numbers">
						<t>the media file containing the recorded name of the new user as retrieved in D1 ("Simon...");</t>
						<t>a pre-recorded media file explaining what happened ("... has joined the conference");</t>
						</list>
						the transaction then takes its usual flow (F2/F3/F4/F5/F6), and the event notifying the end
						of the announcement (G1, acked in G2) concludes the scenario.
						</t>
					</list>

			<section title="Coaching Scenario" anchor="sec-conf-coaching">
				<t>
					Another typical conference-based use case is the so called Coaching Scenario. In
					such a scenario, a customer (called A in the following example) places a call to
					a business call center. An agent (B) is assigned to the customer. Besides, a
					coach (C), unheard from the customer, provides the agent with whispered suggestions
					about what to say. This scenario is also described in RFC4579 <xref target="RFC4579"/>.
				</t>
				<t>
					As it can be evinced from the scenario description, per-user policies for media mixing
					and delivery, i.e who can hear what, are very important. The MS must make sure that
					only the agent can hear the coach's suggestions. Since this is basically a multiparty
					call (despite what the customer may be thinking), a mixing entity is needed in
					order to accomplish the scenario requirements. To summarize:
				</t>
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>the customer (A) must only hear what the agent (B) says;</t>
						<t>the agent (B) must be able to hear both the customer (A) and the coach (C);</t>
						<t>the coach (C) must be able to hear both the customer (A), in order to give the
						right suggestions, and the agent (B), in order to be aware of the whole conversation.</t>
					</list>
				</t>
				<t>
					From the media and framework perspective, such a scenario
					can be seen as it is depicted in <xref target="fig-coach-rtp"/>.

					What the scenario should look like from the framework point of view is
					instead depicted in <xref target="fig-coach"/>. The customer receives
					media directly from the agent (recvonly), while all the three involved participants
					contribute to a hidden conference: of course the customer is not allowed
					to receive the mixed flows from the conference (sendonly), unlike the agent and the
					coach which must both be aware of the whole conversation (sendrecv).

					In the framework this can be achieved by means of the mixer control package,
					which, as already explained in previous sections, can be exploited whenever
					mixing and joining entities is needed. The needed steps can be summarized in
					the following steps:
				</t>
				<t>
					<list style="numbers">
						<t>first of all, a hidden conference is created;</t>
						<t>then, all the three participants are attached to it, each with a custom mixing policy, specifically:
							<list style="symbols">
							<t>the customer (A) as 'sendonly';</t>
							<t>the agent (B) as 'sendrecv';</t>
							<t>the coach (C) as 'sendrecv' and with a -3dB gain to halve the volume of its own contribution (so that
							the agent actually hears the customer louder, and the coach whispering);</t>
							</list></t>
						<t>finally, the customer is joined to the agent as a passive receiver (recvonly).</t>
					</list>
				</t>
