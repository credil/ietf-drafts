1.  Introduction

   RFC 3611 [RFC3611] defines seven report block formats for network
   management and quality monitoring.  However, these metrics are mostly
   for multicast inference of network characteristics (MINC) or voice
   over IP (VoIP) monitoring and not widely applicable to other
   applications, e.g., video quality monitoring.  This document focuses
   on specifying new additional report block types used to convey video-
   related parameters at the application layer that are generically
   designed for use in audio and video services.

   The metrics belong to the class of application layer metrics defined
   in [I-D.hunt-avtcore-monarch].


2.  Terminology

   FEC

      Forward Error Correction
   Picture Type

      Picture types used in the different video algorithms are composed
      of the key-frame and the Derivation frame.  Key-frame is also
      called a reference frame and used as a reference for predicting
      other pictures.  It is coded without prediction from other
      pictures.  The Derivation frame is derived from a Key-frame using
      prediction from the reference frame.

   RTP

      Real-time Transport Protocol [RFC3550].

   RTCP

      RTP Control Protocol [RFC3550].

   RTCP XR

      RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports [RFC3611].


3.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Applicability

   The Report Blocks defined in this document can be applied to any
   real-time applications that convey video-related parameters at the
   application layer.


5.  Application Layer Metrics

5.1.  Application Layer Statistics Summary Report Block

   This block reports statistics beyond the information carried in the
   Statistics Summary Report Block specified in Section 4.6 of RFC 3611
   [RFC3611].  Information is recorded about lost frames, duplicated
   frames, and lost partial frames.  Such information can be useful for
   network management and video quality monitoring.

   The Application Layer Statistics Summary Report Block has the
   following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   block_type (BT): 8 bits

      The Application Layer Statistics Summary Report Block is
      identified by the constant <ALSS>.

   rsvd: 4 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   picture_type_indicator (T): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate the frame type being reported.  Set
      to 0 if the lost_frames field or dup_frames field contain a key
      frame report or reference frame report, 1 if the lost_frames field
      and dup_frames field contain other derivation frame report.

   P: 1 bit

      Bit set to 1 if the partial_lost_frames field or the partial_dup_
      frames field contains a report, 0 otherwise.

   R: 2 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   block_length: 16 bits

      The constant 5, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   begin_seq: 16 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   end_seq: 16 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   number_of_frames_expected: 32bits

      A count of the number of frames of the type indicated by the
      picture_type_indicator field expected, estimated if necessary.  If
      no such frames have been received then this count shall be set to
      zero (0).

   lost_full_frames: 32 bits

      If a frame is completely lost, this frame is regarded as one lost
      full frame.  The lost_full_frames field is equivalent to the
      number of full frames of the type indicated by the
      picture_type_indicator field lost in the above sequence number
      interval.

Internet-Draft     Application Layer Statistics Blocks         June 2011


   dup_frames: 32 bits

      Number of duplicate frames in the above sequence number interval.

   lost_partial_frames: 32 bits

      If one frame is partially lost, this frame is regarded as one lost
      fractional frame.  The lost_partial_frames field is equivalent to
      the number of lost fractional frames in the above sequence number
      interval.


5.2.  Application Layer Loss and Discard Metrics Block

   A frame shall be regarded as lost if it fails to arrive within an
   implementation-specific time window.  A frame that arrives within
   this time window but is too early or late to be played out shall be
   regarded as discarded.  A frame shall be classified as one of
   received (or OK), discarded or lost.

   This block reports Loss and Discard metrics statistics beyond the
   information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  The block
   reports separately on packets lost on the IP channel, and those that
   have been received but then discarded by the receiving jitter buffer.

   It is very useful to distinguish between frames lost by the network
   and those discarded due to jitter.  Both have equal effect on the
   quality of the video stream, however, having separate counts helps
   identify the source of quality degradation.  These fields MUST be
   populated, and MUST be set to zero if no frames have been received.

   The Loss and Discard metrics are determined after the effects of FEC,
   redundancy [RFC2198] or other similar processes.  Implementations
   MUST provide values for all the fields defined here.  For certain
   metrics, if the value is undefined or unknown, then the specified
   default or unknown field value MUST be provided.

   The block is encoded as six 32-bit words:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   block type (BT): 8 bits

      An Application Layer Loss and Discard Metrics Block is identified
      by the constant <ALLDM>.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the metrics block is an
      Interval or a Cumulative report,

   reserved: 3 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Picture type indicator (T): 1 bit

      Picture types used in the different video algorithms compose of
      key-frame and derivation frame.  This field is used to indicate
      the picture type to be reported.  Bits set to 0 if the Loss rate
      field and discard rate field contain a Key_frame report or
      reference frame report, 1 if the Loss rate field and discard rate
      field contain other derivation frame reports.

   reserved: 3 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   block length: 16 bits

      The constant 1, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   Frame Loss rate: 8 bits

      The proportion of frames lost since the beginning of reception,
      expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point at the
      left edge of the field.  This value is calculated by dividing the
      total number of lost frames containing specified frame (e.g., Key
      frame) (after the effects of applying any error protection such as
      FEC) by the total number of frames expected, multiplying the
      result of the division by 256, limiting the maximum value to 255
      (to avoid overflow), and taking the integer part.  The numbers of
      duplicated frames and discarded frames do not enter into this
      calculation.  Since receivers cannot be required to maintain

      unlimited buffers, a receiver MAY categorize late-arriving frames
      as lost.  The degree of lateness that triggers a loss SHOULD be
      significantly greater than that which triggers a discard.

   Frame Discard rate: 8 bits

      The proportion of frames discarded since the beginning of
      reception, due to late or early arrival, under-run or overflow at
      the receiving jitter buffer.  This value is expressed as a fixed
      point number with the binary point at the left edge of the field.
      It is calculated by dividing the total number of discarded frames
      containing specified frame (e.g., Key Frame) (excluding duplicate
      frames discards) by the total number of frames expected,
      multiplying the result of the division by 256, limiting the
      maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and taking the integer
      part.


5.3.  Application Layer Burst Metrics Block

   This block reports Burst metrics statistics beyond the information
   carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  It reports on the
   combined effect of losses and discards, as both have equal effect on
   video quality.

   In order to properly assess the quality of a video stream, it is
   desirable to consider the degree of burstiness of packet loss
   [RFC3357].  Following the one-way loss pattern sample metrics
   discussed in [RFC3357], a measure of the spacing between consecutive
   network packet loss or error events, is a "loss distance".  The loss
   distance metric captures the spacing between the loss periods.  The
   duration of a loss or error event (e.g. and how many packets are lost
   in that duration) is a "loss period", the loss period metric captures
   the frequency and length (burstiness) of loss once it starts.  Delay
   reports include the transit delay between RTP end points and the end
   system processing delays, both of which contribute to the user
   perceived delay.

   Implementations MUST provide values for all the fields defined here.
   For certain metrics, if the value is undefined or unknown, then the
   specified default or unknown field value MUST be provided.

   The block is encoded as three 32-bit words:

   block type (BT): 8 bits

      The Application Layer Burst Metrics Block is identified by the
      constant <ALBM>.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the metrics block is an
      Interval or a Cumulative report,

   rsvd: 7 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   block length: 16 bits

      The constant 2, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   Loss Distance: 16 bits

      The average duration of periods between bursts.  The mean
      duration, expressed in milliseconds, of the gap periods that have
      occurred since the beginning of reception [DSLF].  The duration of
      each period is calculated based upon the frame packets that marks
      the end of the prior burst and the frame packet that marks the
      beginning of the subsequent burst.  It is equal to the timestamp
      of the subsequent burst frame packet, minus the timestamp of the
      prior burst frame packet, plus the duration of the prior burst
      frame packet.  If the actual values are not available, estimated
      values MUST be used.  In the case of a gap that occurs at the
      beginning of reception, the sum of the timestamp of the prior
      burst packet and the duration of the prior burst packet are
      replaced by the reception start time.  In the case of a gap that
      occurs at the end of reception, the timestamp of the subsequent
      burst packet is replaced by the reception end time.  If there have

      been no gap periods, the gap duration value MUST be zero.

   Loss Period: 16 bits

      The average duration of a burst of lost and discarded frames.  The
      mean duration, expressed in milliseconds, of the loss intervals
      that have occurred since the beginning of reception [DSLF].  The
      duration of each loss period is calculated based upon the frame
      packets that mark the beginning and end of that period.  It is
      equal to the timestamp of the end frame, plus the duration of the
      end frame, minus the timestamp of the beginning frame.  If the
      actual values are not available, estimated values MUST be used.
      If there have been no burst periods, the burst duration value MUST
      be zero.

   Threshold: 16 bits

      The maximum duration, expressed in milliseconds, of the loss
      distance that have occurred since the beginning of reception.

   Reserved: 16 bits

      All bits SHALL be set to 0 by the sender and SHALL be ignored on
      reception.



6.  SDP Signaling

   Three new parameters are defined for the three report blocks defined
   in this document to be used with SDP [RFC4566] using the Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].  They have the following syntax
   within the "rtcp-xr" attribute [RFC3611]:

     rtcp-xr-attrib =  "a=rtcp-xr:"
                       [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF
           xr-format =
                       / application-loss-metrics
                       / application-burst-metrics
                       / application-stat-summary

   application-burst-metrics = " application-burst-metrics"
                                 ["=" max-size]
         max-size = 1*DIGIT ; maximum block size in octets

   application--loss-metrics = " application-loss-metrics"
                          ["=" stat-flag *("," stat-flag)]
            stat-flag = "key Frame loss and duplication"
                           / "derivation Frame loss and duplication"

   application-stat-summary = "application-stat-summary"
                         ["=" stat-flag *("," stat-flag)]
               stat-flag = "key Frame loss and duplication"
                      / "derivation Frame loss and duplication"

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.


7.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of [RFC3611].

   This document assigns three new block type value in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry:

      Name:       ALSS
      Long Name:  Application Layer Statistics Summary
      Value       <ALSS>
      Reference:  Section 5.1

      Name:       ALLDM
      Long Name:  Application Layer Loss and Discard Metrics
      Value       <ALLDM>
      Reference:  Section 5.2

      Name:       ALBM
      Long Name:  Application Layer Burst Metrics
      Value       <ALBM>
      Reference:  Section 5.3

   This document also registers three new SDP [RFC4566] parameters for
   the "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry:

      *  "application-layer-loss-metrics"
      *  "application-layer-burst-metrics"
      *  "application-layer-stat-summary"

   The contact information for the registrations is:

8.  Security Considerations

   The new RTCP XR report blocks proposed in this document introduce no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
