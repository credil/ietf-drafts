Ethernet Traffic Parameters                                  Nov. 2007 
 
 
Abstract 
    
   This document described the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) - specific 
   Ethernet Traffic Parameters as described in MEF10.1 when using 
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Resource 
   ReSerVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling. 
    
 
Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 
    
   Moreover, the reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology 
   MEF10 as well as [RFC3471] and [RFC3473].   
    
1. Introduction 
    
   Per [RFC3471], GMPLS allows the inclusion of technology specific 
   parameters in signaling. Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC specific 
   objects are introduced in this document that describes Metro Ethernet 
   Forum (MEF) Ethernet traffic parameters as specified in [MEF10.1]. 
    
   These traffic parameters MUST be used when L2SC is specified in the 
   LSP Switching Type field of a Generalized Label Request (see 
   [RFC3471]) and the LSP encoding type is Ethernet. 
    
   For Ethernet Private Line (EPL) services [MEF6], these traffic 
   parameters are applicable non-discriminately to all EVCs crossing a 
   given port. 
    
   For Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL) services [MEF6], these 
   traffic parameters are applicable per Ethernet Virtual Connection 
   (EVC) with single or multiple Class of Service (CoS), independently 
   of its associated (set of) VLAN ID (VID).  
    
   Association between EVC and VIDs is detailed in [MEF10.1]. The format 
   and encoding of the (set of) VIDs are documented in a companion 
   document [GMPLS-ESVCS]. 
    
2. Overview 
    
   The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC object includes the Ethernet link 
   type (switching granularity) of the requested LSP, and the MTU value 
   for the LSP.

Ethernet Traffic Parameters                                  Nov. 2007 
 
 
   Bandwidth Profile defines the set of traffic parameters applicable to 
   a sequence of Service Frames, referred to as bandwidth profile 
   parameters: 
    
   - Committed Rate: indicates the rate at which traffic commits to 
     be sent to the Ethernet LSP. The Committed Rate is described in 
     terms of the CIR (Committed Information Rate) and CBS (Committed 
     Burst Size) traffic parameters. 
     
     CIR is defined as the average rate (in bytes per unit of time) 
     up to which the network is committed to transfer frames and 
     meets its performance objectives. 
    
     CBS defines a limit on the maximum number of information units 
     (e.g. bytes) available for a burst of frames sent at the 
     interface speed to remain CIR-conformant. 
    
   - Excess Rate: indicates the extent by which the traffic sent on a 
     Ethernet LSP exceeds the committed rate. The Excess Rate is 
     described in terms of the EIR (Excess Information Rate) and EBS 
     (Excess Burst Size) traffic parameters. 
    
     EIR is defined as the average rate (in bytes per unit of time), 
     in excess of the CIR, up to which the network may transfer 
     frames without any performance objectives. 
    
     EBS defines a limit on the maximum number of information units 
     (e.g. bytes) available for a burst of frames sent at the 
     interface speed to remain EIR-conformant. 
    
   - The color mode (CM) parameter indicates whether the "color- 
     aware" or "color-blind" property is employed by the bandwidth 
     profile. 
    
   - The coupling flag (CF) parameter allows the choice between two 
     modes of operations of the rate enforcement algorithm. 
    
3. Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object  
    
   The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object (Class-Num = 12, Class-Type = TBA by 
   IANA) has the following format:

            so that the TLV is four-octet aligned.  
 
3.1 Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLV

      This field is defined as a vector of binary flags. The following  
      flags are defined: 
    
         Flag 1 (bit 0): coupling flag (CF) 
         Flag 2 (bit 1): color mode (CM) 
    
      Where bit 0 is the low order bit. Other flags are reserved, 
      they SHOULD be set to zero when sent, and SHOULD be ignored when   
      received. 
       
      A flag is set to one to indicate that the corresponding metering 
      is requested. 
    
      The Flag 1 allows the choice between two modes of operations of 
      the rate enforcement algorithm. 
    
      The Flag 2 indicates whether the color-aware or color-blind 
      property is employed by the bandwidth profile. When Flag 2 is set 
      to 0 (1), the bandwidth profile algorithm is said to be in 
      color blind (color aware) mode. 
    
   Index: 8 bits 
    
      The index field is used to reference bandwidth allocated for a      
      given traffic class in case a multiple-class LSP is being   
      requested. The index field value MUST correspond to at least one  
      of the index value included in the extended ClassType object ([DS- 
      TE], [MCOS]).  
    
      A given index value j can be associated to at most N Class-Type  
      values CTi (i =< N) of the extended Class-Type object. This  
      applies in case a set of one or more CTi maps a single BW profile  
      (shared). An example of value setting consists then in assigning  
      an arbitrary value (between 0x10 and 0x77) associated to set of  
      CTi. 
    
      As a particular case, a given index value j can be associated to a  
      single CTi (1:1 correspondence). An example of index value setting  
      consists then in allocating the CTi value to the index field  
      itself (i.e. 0x00,...,0x07). This applies in case a single CTi  
      maps a single BW profile or multiple BW profiles (dedicated). In  
      the former case (single BW profile), the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC  
      object includes a single Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLV. In the  
      second case, the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC includes a set of more than  
      one Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLVs (whose respective index value  
      is associated to a single CTi value).  
    
      Note that the current specification allow for combining shared and

Ethernet Traffic Parameters                                  Nov. 2007 
 
 
      dedicated BW profiles to the same LSP. That is, an Ethernet  
      SENDER_TSPEC MAY include multiple Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLVs  
      whose respective index can be associated on a 1:1 basis to a  
      single CTi or to a set of multiple CTi.  
    
      For each subobject of the extended Class-Type object [MCOS]:  
      - each CTi value SHOULD correspond 1:1 to MEF CE VLAN-CoS 
      - the BW requested per CTi field MAY be used for bandwidth  
        accounting purposes.  
 
      By default, the value of the index field MUST be set to 0.   
    
   Reserved: 16 bits 
      
      These bits SHOULD be set to zero when sent and MUST be ignored 
      when received. 
    
   CIR (Committed Information Rate): 32 bits 
        
      The value of the CIR is in units of bytes per second. The CIR is 
      encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number 
      (see [RFC1832]). 
    
      The CIR value MUST be greater than or equal to 0. 
    
   CBS (Committed Burst Size): 32 bits 
    
      The value of the CBS is in units of bytes. The CBS is encoded 
      as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number (see 
      [RFC1832]). 
    
      When CIR is strictly greater than 0 (CIR > 0), the CBS MUST be 
      greater than or equal to the maximum frame size. 
    
   EIR (Excess Information Rate): 32 bits 
    
      The value of the EIR is in units of bytes per second. The EIR 
      is encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point 
      number (see [RFC1832]). 
      
      The EIR value MUST be greater than or equal to 0. 
    
   EBS (Excess Burst Size): 32 bits 
    
      The value of the EBS is in units of bytes. The EBS is encoded 
      as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number (see 
      [RFC1832]).

      When EIR is strictly greater than 0 (EIR > 0), the EBS MUST be  
      greater than or equal to the maximum frame size. 
    
4. Ethernet FLOWSPEC format 
    
   The Ethernet FLOWSPEC object (Class-Num = 12, Class-Type = TBA by 
   IANA) has the same format as the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object. 
 
5. ADSPEC considerations 
    
   There is no ADSPEC associated with the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object. 
    
   Either the ADSPEC is omitted or an Int-serv ADSPEC with the Default 
   General Characterization Parameters and Guaranteed Service fragment 
   is used, see [RFC2210]. 
    
    
6. Processing 
    
   The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object carries the traffic specification 
   generated by the RSVP session sender. The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC 
   object SHOULD be forwarded and delivered unchanged to both 
   intermediate and egress nodes. 
    
   The Ethernet FLOWSPEC object carries reservation request information 
   generated by receivers. As with any FLOWSPEC object, Ethernet 
   FLOWSPEC object flows upstream toward the ingress node. 
    
   Intermediate and egress nodes MUST verify that the node itself and 
   the interfaces on which the LSP will be established can support the 
   requested Switching Granularity, MTU and values included in sub- 
   object TLVs. If the requested value(s) can not be supported, the 
   receiver node MUST generate a PathErr message with the error code 
   "Traffic Control Error" and the error value "Service unsupported" 
   (see [RFC2205]). 
    
   In addition, if the MTU field is received with a value smaller than 
   the minimum transfer unit size of the Ethernet frame (e.g. 46 bytes 
   for Ethernet v2, 38 bytes for IEEE 802.3), the node MUST generate a 
   PathErr message with the error code "Traffic Control Error" and the 
   error value "Bad Tspec value" (see [RFC2205]). 
    
   Error processing of the Extended Class-Type object follows rules 
   defined in [MCOS]. Moreover, an LSR receiving a Path message with the 
   Extended Class-Type object, which recognizes the object and the 
   particular Class-Type but does detect a mismatch in the index values, 
   MUST send a PathErr towards the sender with the error code "Extended 
   Class-Type Error" and the error value "Class-Type mismatch" (see 
   [RFC2205]).

   GMPLS security is described in section 11 of [RFC3471] and refers to 
   [RFC3209] for RSVP-TE. 
    
8. IANA Considerations 
    
   Two values have been defined by IANA for this document: 
    
   Two RSVP C-Types in registry: 
         http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters 
    
      -  An Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object: Class = 12, C-Type = TBA (see 
         Section 3). 
    
      -  An Ethernet FLOWSPEC object: Class = 9, C-Type = TBA (see    
         Section 4).
