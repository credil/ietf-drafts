               Protocol Independent Multicast ECMP Assert
                       draft-ietf-pim-ecmp-00.txt

Abstract

   A PIM router uses RPF procedure to select an upstream interface and
   router to build forwarding state.  When there are equal cost multiple
   paths (ECMP), existing implementations often use hash algorithms to
   select a path.  Such algorithms do not allow the spread of traffic
   among the ECMPs according to administrative metrics.  This usually
   leads to inefficient or ineffective use of network resources.  This
   document introduces the ECMP Assert, a mechanism to improve the RPF
   procedure over ECMPs.  It allows ECMP path selection to be based on
   administratively selected metrics, such as data transmission delays,
   path preferences and routing metrics.

2.  Introduction

   A PIM [RFC4601] router uses RPF procedure to select an upstream
   interface and a PIM neighbor on that interface to build forwarding
   state.  When there are equal cost multiple paths (ECMP) upstream,
   existing implementations often use hash algorithms to select a path.
   Such algorithms do not allow the spread of traffic among the ECMP
   according to administrative metrics.  This usually leads to
   inefficient or ineffective use of network resources.  This document
   introduces the ECMP Assert, a mechanism to improve the RPF procedure
   over ECMP.  It allows ECMP path selection to be based on
   administratively selected metrics, such as data transmission delays,
   path preferences and routing metrics, or a combination of metrics.

   ECMPs are frequently used in networks to provide redundancy and to
   increase available bandwidth.  A PIM router selects a path in the
   ECMP based on its own implementation specific choice.  The selection
   is a local decision.  One way is to choose the PIM neighbor with the
   highest IP address, another is to pick the PIM neighbor with the best
   hash value over the destination and source addresses.

   While implementations supporting ECMP have been deployed widely, the
   existing RPF selection methods have weaknesses.  The lack of
   administratively effective ways to allocate traffic over alternative
   paths is a major issue.  For example, there is no straightforward way
   to tell two downstream routers to select either the same or different
   RPF neighbor routers for the same traffic flows.

   With the ECMP Assert mechanism introduced here, the upstream routers
   use a new PIM ECMP Assert message to instruct the downstream routers
   on how to tie-break among the upstream neighbors.  The PIM ECMP
   Assert message conveys the tie-break information based on metrics
   selected administratively.

2.1.  Overview

   The existing PIM Assert mechanism allows the upstream router to
   detect the existence of multiple forwarders for the same multicast
   flow onto the same downstream interface.  The upstream router sends a
   PIM Assert message containing a routing metric for the downstream
   routers to use for tie-breaking among the multiple upstream



Yiqun Cai, et al.         Expires March 3, 2012                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              PIMv2 ECMP Assert                August 2011


   forwarders on the same RPF interface.

   With ECMP interfaces between the downstream and upstream routers, the
   PIM ECMP Assert mechanism works in a similar way, but extends the
   ability to resolve the selection of forwarders among different
   interfaces in the ECMP.

   When a PIM router downstream of the ECMP interfaces creates a new
   (*,G) or (S,G) entry, it will populate the RPF interface and RPF
   neighbor information according to the rules specified by [RFC4601].
   This router will send its initial joins to that RPF neighbor.

   When the RPF neighbor router receives the join message and finds that
   the receiving interface is one of the ECMP interfaces, it will check
   if the same flow is already being forwarded out of another ECMP
   interface.  If so, this RPF neighbor router will send a PIM ECMP
   Assert message onto the interface the join was received on.  The PIM
   ECMP Assert message contains the address of the desired RPF neighbor,
   an interface ID [INTID], along with other parameters used as tie
   breakers.  In essence, a PIM ECMP Assert message is sent by an
   upstream router to notify downstream routers to redirect PIM Joins to
   the new RPF neighbor via a different interface.  When the downstream
   routers receive this message, they should trigger PIM Joins toward
   the new RPF neighbor specified in the packet.

   This new message is named PIM ECMP Assert for the following reasons,

   1.  It is sent by an upstream router;
   2.  It is used to influence the RPF selection by downstream routers;
       And
   3.  A tie breaker metric is used.

   This new message functions in similar ways to the existing PIM Assert
   message, with the exception that the existing Assert message is used
   to select an upstream router within the same multi-access network
   (such as a LAN) while the new message is used to select both a
   network and an upstream router.

   One advantage of this design is that the control messages are only
   sent when there is need to "re-balance" the traffic.  This reduces
   the amount of control traffic.

2.2.  Applicability

   The use of ECMP Assert applies to shared trees or source trees built
   with procedures described in [RFC4601].  The use of ECMP Assert in
   "Protocol Independent Multicast - Dense Mode" [RFC3973] or in
   "Bidirectional Protocol Independent Multicast" [RFC5015] is not

   considered.

   The enhancement described in this document can be applicable to a
   number of scenarios.  For example, it allows a network operator to
   use ECMP paths and have the ability to perform load splitting based
   on bandwidth.  To do this, the downstream routers perform RPF
   selection with bandwidth instead of IP addresses as a tie breaker.
   The ECMP Assert mechanism assures that all downstream routers select
   the desired network link and upstream router whenever possible.
   Another example is for a network operator to impose a transmission
   delay limit on certain links.  The ECMP Assert mechanism provides a
   mean for an upstream router to instruct a downstream router to choose
   a different RPF path.

   This specification does not dictate the scope of applications of this
   mechanism.


3.  Protocol Specification

3.1.  ECMP Bundle

   An ECMP bundle is a set of PIM enabled interfaces on a router, where
   all interfaces belonging to the same bundle share the same routing
   metric.  The ECMP paths reside between the upstream and downstream
   routers over the ECMP bundle.

   There can be one or more ECMP bundles on any router, while one
   individual interface can only belong to a single bundle.

   ECMP bundles are created on a router via configuration.

3.2.  Sending ECMP Assert

   ECMP Asserts are sent by an upstream router in a rate limited
   fashion, under the following conditions,

   o  It detects a PIM Join on a non-desired outgoing interface; or
   o  It detects multicast traffic on a non-desired outgoing interface.

   In both cases, an ECMP Assert is sent to the non-desired interface.
   An outgoing interface is considered "non-desired" when,

   o  The upstream router is already forwarding the same flow out of
      another interface belonging to the same ECMP bundle;
   o  The upstream router is not forwarding the flow yet out any
      interfaces of the ECMP bundle, but there is another interface with
      more desired attributes.

Internet-Draft              PIMv2 ECMP Assert                August 2011


   An upstream router may choose not to send ECMP Asserts if it becomes
   aware that some of the downstream routers do not support the new
   message, or unreachable via some links in ECMP bundle.

3.3.  Receiving ECMP Assert

   When a downstream router receives an ECMP Assert, and detects the
   desired RPF path from its upstream router's point of view is
   different from its current one, it should choose to prune from the
   current path and join to the new path.  The exact order of such
   actions is implementation specific.

   If a downstream router receives multiple ECMP Asserts sent by
   different upstream routers, it SHOULD use the Preference, Metric, or
   other fields as specified below, as the tie breakers to choose the
   most preferred RPF interface and neighbor.

   If an upstream router receives an ECMP Assert from another upstream
   router, it SHOULD NOT change its forwarding behavior even if the ECMP
   Assert makes it a less preferred RPF neighbor on the receiving
   interface.

3.4.  Transient State

   During a transient network outage with a single link cut in an ECMP
   bundle, a downstream router may lose connection to its RPF neighbor
   and the normal ECMP Assert operation may be interrupted temporarily.
   In such an event, the following actions are recommended.

   The down stream router may re-select a new RPF neighbor.  Among all
   ECMP upstream routers, the one on the same LAN as the previous RPF
   neighbor is preferred.

   If there is no upstream router reachable on the same LAN, the down
   stream router will select a RPF neighbor on a different LAN.  Among
   all ECMP upstream routers, the one served as RPF neighbor before the
   link failure is preferred.  Such a router can be identified by the
   Router ID which is part of the Interface ID in the PIM ECMP Assert
   Hello option.

   During normal ECMP Assert operations, when PIM Joins for the same
   (*,G) or (S,G) are received on a different LAN, an upstream router
   will send ECMP Assert to prune the non-preferred LAN.  Such ECMP
   Asserts during partial network outage can be supressed if the
   upstream router decides that the non-preferred PIM Join is from a
   router that is not reachable via the preferred LAN.  This check can
   be performed by retrieving the downstream's Router ID, using the
   source address in the PIM join, and searching neighbors on the

   preferred LAN for one with the same router ID.

3.5.  Interoperability

   If a PIM router supports this draft, it MUST send the new Hello
   option ECMP-Assert-Supported TLV in its PIM Hello messages.  A PIM
   router sends ECMP Asserts on an interface only when it detects that
   all neighbors have sent this Hello option.  If a PIM router detects
   that any of its neighbor does not support this Hello option, it MUST
   not send ECMP Asserts, however, it SHOULD still process any ECMP
   Asserts received.

   Type:   TBD
   Neighbor Address (32/128 bits):   Address of desired upstream
      neighbor where the downstream receiver should redirect PIM Joins
      to.  This address MUST be associated with an interface in the same
      ECMP bundle as the ECMP Assert message's outgoing interface.  If
      the "Interface ID" field (see below) is ignored, this "Neighbor
      Address" field uniquely identifies a LAN and an upstream router to
      which a downstream router should redirect its Join messages to,
      and an ECMP Assert message MUST be discarded if the "Neighbor
      Address" field in the message does not match cached neighbor
      address.
   Interface ID (64 bits):   This field is used in IPv4 when one or more
      RPF neighbors in the ECMP bundle are unnumbered, or in IPv6 where
      link local addresses are in use.  For other IPv4 usage, this field
      is zero'ed when sent, and ignored when received.  If the "Router
      ID" part of the "Interface ID" is zero, the field must be ignored.
      See [INTID] for details of its assignment and usage in PIM Hellos.
      If the "Interface ID" is not ignored, the receiving router of this
      message MUST use the "Interface ID", instead of "Neighbor

      Address", to identify the new RPF neighbor, and an ECMP Assert
      message MUST be discarded if the "Interface ID" field in the
      message does not match cached interface ID.
   Preference (8 bits):   The first tie breaker when ECMP Asserts from
      multiple upstream routers are compared against each other.
      Numerically smaller value is preferred.  A reserved (15) value is
      used to indicate the metric value following the "Preference" field
      is a timestamp, taken at the moment the sending router started to
      forward out of this interface.
   Metric (64 bits):   The second tie breaker if the the "Preference"
      values are the same.  Numerically smaller metric is preferred.
      This "Metric" can contain path parameters defined by users.  When
      both "Preference" and "Metric" values are the same, "Neighbor
      Address" or "Interface ID" field is used as the third tie-breaker,
      depends on which field is used to identify the RPF neighbor, and
      the bigger value wins.


4.  IANA Considerations

   A new PIM Type is required to be assigned to the ECMP Assert
   messages.  According to [PIMREG], this document recommends 11 (0xB)
   as the new "PIM ECMP Assert Type".


5.  Security Considerations

   Security of the ECMP Assert is only guaranteed by the security of the
   PIM packet, so the security considerations for PIM Assert packets as
   described in [RFC4601] apply here.  Spoofed ECMP Assert packets may
   cause the downstream routers to send PIM Joins to an undesired
   upstream router, and trigger more ECMP Assert messages.
