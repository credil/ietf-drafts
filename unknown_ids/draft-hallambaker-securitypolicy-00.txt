               Security Policy Distribution Format (SPDF)
                  draft-hallambaker-securitypolicy-00

Abstract

   This document describes a format for distributing security policy
   statments.

   Individual security policy statements are expressed in a HTTP
   compatible header syntax.  Lists of security policy statements are
   exchanged as signed CMS objects.  Strong references to static data
   objects are formed using Named Information (ni) URI specifiers.

   Relying Application  An application whose operation depends on use of

2.  Introduction

   Recent compromises of critical infrastructure have highlighted the
   weaknesses that result from the fact that on the Internet, security
   is an option, not the default.

   Security Policy provides a mechanism for advising parties of the
   minimum degree of security that they should accept for a
   communication and thus preventing downgrade attacks.

2.1.  Requirements

   Security Policy statements provide a mechanism for advising parties
   of the risk of a downgrade attack and the enforcement actions that
   are appropriate based on the quality of the security policy
   information available.

   While the natural inclination of security specialists is to advise
   that a security policy violation always result in a hard failure with
   the corresponding transaction being aborted, this approach imposes a
   high cost for false positives.  Previous attempts to employ security
   policy data (e.g. in DKIM) have faced objections from those fearing
   that the false positive rate will be unacceptably high.

   Recent events have demonstrated that the value of reporting a
   security policy violation is considerably higher than than security
   policy enforcement on a limited scale.  While security policy
   enforcement has the potential to protect the individual Internet
   user, reporting a violation to the appropriate parties has the
   potential to protect the entire community of Internet users.

2.1.1.  Protocol Downgrade Attack

   In a protocol downgrade attack the attacker causes client software to
   communicate en-clair when TLS or some other security enhancement is
   offered.

Internet-Draft     Security Policy Distribution Format      October 2011


2.1.2.  CA Downgrade Attack

   In a CA downgrade attack the attacker applies for a certificate from
   a different issuer to that authorized by the Domain name holder or
   for a category of certificate with lest strict validation
   requirements.

2.1.3.  Use of Revoked Certificate

   Although PKIX specifies two mechanisms for certificate status
   checking, many clients will accept certificates when access to the
   certificate status checking infrastructure fails.

2.1.3.1.  Use of Expired Certificate

   Although use of expired certificates is discouraged, the frequency
   with which use of expired certificates occurs from administrative
   oversight prevents strict enforcement.

2.1.4.  Security Policy Origination

   Security policy statements may be obtained from explicit statements
   by domain name holders or obtained heuristically from observation of
   the network.

2.1.4.1.  Explicit

   A domain name holder MAY specify security policy explicitly through
   publication mechanisms that include:

      Publishing statements in Security Policy Distribution Format

      Security Policy Statements in HTTP headers

      Security Policy Statements in DNS records

      Out of band contact with remediation parties.

      Statements to a Certification Authority at certificate issue.

   Even though a statement is explicit, an enforcement point may only
   learn of its existence through heuristic means.  For example
   observing DNS traffic, use of Web crawlers and HTTPS inspection.

   Publication of an explicit Security policy Statement requires a
   considerable commitment of time and effort for a large site.

Internet-Draft     Security Policy Distribution Format      October 2011


2.1.4.2.  Heuristic

   Security policy data MAY also be determined heuristically by
   observation of network traffic.  If a site has been using a
   particular CA for many years and a certificate is suddenly detected
   from an obscure issuer, questions may be asked.

   While the quality of heuristic data may fall short of that required
   to abort transactions by itself, it can still provide a useful basis
   for reporting potential violations and for enforcement when combined
   with data from other sources.

2.1.5.  Security Policy Distribution

   Security policy can be distributed through multiple channels.  The
   best choice of channel depends on the information in question and the
   application.

2.1.5.1.  Embedded

   The Security Policy is embedded in client or operating system code.
   This approach has traditionally been limited to embedding revocation
   notices for certificates that have been known to be fraudulently
   issued.

2.1.5.2.  In-Band

   The security policy data is carried in the protocol to which the
   policy applies.  E.G HTTP headers for a HTTP transaction.  One
   drawback to this approach is that it only provides 'secure after
   first contact'.

2.1.5.3.  DNS

   The DNS has been used to distribute Security Policy Statements.  The
   principle drawback being that deployment of DNSSEC is immature and
   likely to be blocked in the regions where security policy is most
   needed.

2.1.5.4.  Data Driven Update

   The format described in this document is designed to support data
   driven update.

   The main limitation to this approach is that it does not scale.  Thus
   the use of the distribution format should be limited to distributing
   policy for the domains that carry the highest risk.

Internet-Draft     Security Policy Distribution Format      October 2011


2.1.5.5.  Irregular

   Security Policy distribution is hard because the adversaries
   encountered to date include nation state actors with complete control
   of the local network infrastructure.  It is thus not possible to
   address every possible need in a standard based approach since the
   adversary can block deployment of the necessary standards.

   It follows that standards based techniques SHOULD be supplemented by
   resort to irregular methods where necessary.

2.2.  Security Policy Statements

2.2.1.  Common Syntax

   All Security Policy Statements have a common syntax based on the
   syntax used in HTTP and SMTP message format.

   Forgetting about the traditional white space and line wrapping
   considerations, the syntax has the format has the following common
   syntax:


   statement         = token ":"  values

   values            = principal-value *("," principal-value)
                                          *( ";" parameter )
   principal-value   = dns-name | uri | quoted-string

   parameter         = attribute "=" value
   attribute         = token
   value             = token | quoted-string

   WS                = " " | tab

2.2.2.  Common Parameters

   The following parameters MAY occur in any Security Policy Statement.

2.2.2.1.  Domain=<dns-name>

   The domain(s) to which the security policy statement applies.

   The wildcard character '*' MAY be used to indicate that the security
   policy statement also applies to subdomains within the specified
   domain.

   To facilitate mapping of security policy originated in DNS records,

Internet-Draft     Security Policy Distribution Format      October 2011


   the rules for use of wildcards are the same as those defined for
   DNSSEC.  I.e. wildcards SHALL only occur as the first label in a DNS
   name, if a domain is in the scope of multiple security policy
   statements, the principle of closest match is applied.

2.2.2.2.  Protocol=<Protocol>*

   A list of protocols to which the Security Policy applies.  Protocols
   are identified by their SRV prefix labels.

2.2.2.3.  UTC=<date-time>

   The time at which the security policy statement was obtained.  This
   MAY be earlier than the time at which the SPDF document is signed but
   SHOULD NOT be later.

2.2.2.4.  Expire=<date-time>

   The time at which the security policy statement expires.  This MUST
   NOT be earlier than the time at which the SPDF document was signed.

2.2.3.  Statement: CA-PIN: <uri>

   The CA-PIN statement is used to prevent a certificate issuer
   downgrade attack.  A certificate SHALL be in violation of the
   specified security policy if the domain in question was within the
   scope of at least one CA-PIN statement at the time in question and
   the certificate does not comply with the requirements of any CA-PIN
   statements that were active at the time in question.

   The principal parameter of a CA-PIN statement is an ni URI that
   specifies the criteria for the pinning.

2.2.3.1.  Match= 'key' | 'csk' | 'cert' | 'path'

   Specifies whether the specified Named Information URI applies to an
   end entity subject key (key), a certificate signing subject key
   (csk), an end entity certificate (cert) or a certificate signing
   certificate (path).  If no match is specified, the 'key' match is the
   default.

2.2.3.1.2.  Calculating the digest of a Certificate.

   TBS

2.2.3.2.  After=<date-time>

   The statement is only to be applied to certificates issued after the
   specified date and time.

2.2.3.3.  Before=<date-time>

   The statement is only to be applied to certificates issued before the
   specified date and time.

2.2.3.4.  Unpin=<uri>

   A Named Information URI that specifies the digest of an unpinning
   value.  Disclosure of the unpinning value has the effect of revoking
   the corresponding security policy statement to which it is attached.

   The unpinning value SHOULD be a randomly chosen nonce with sufficient
   ergodicity to make determination by brute force attack infeasible.

2.2.4.  Statement: Unpin: <data>

   An unpinning value for a previously distributed CA pinning statement
   encoded as Base64.

2.2.5.  Statement: Revoke: <uri>

   The Revoke statement is used to declare that a certificate is
   invalid.

   While the functionality of the Revoke statement overlaps the
   capabilities and functionality of the existing PKIX revocation
   schemes (CRLs and OCSP), it is intended for a different field of use.

   In particular the Revoke statement SHOULD NOT be employed except as a
   last resort mechanism for use in situations that are not adequately
   addressed by the existing certificate status infrastructure and the
   risk of relying on the revoked certificate is unacceptably high.

2.2.6.  Statement: Action: <action>

   Specifies the action that SHOULD be performed in the case that a
   security policy violation is detected.  Valid actions are 'Ignore',
   'Advise', 'Fail' and 'Block':

Internet-Draft     Security Policy Distribution Format      October 2011


   Ignore  The client SHOULD ignore policy violations.  This option is
      intended for use in testing Security Policy configuration prior to
      requesting enforcement.

   Advise  The client SHOULD advise the user when policy violations
      occur but not impede access to the corresponding network resource.

   Fail  The client SHOULD advise the user that a policy violation has
      occurred and discourage (but not prevent) access to the
      corresponding network resource.

   Block  The client SHOULD advise the user that a policy violation has
      occurred and prevent access to the corresponding network resource.

   Note that the specification of client actions is independent of
   reporting requests.

2.2.7.  Statement: Report: <dns-name>

   This part is to be aligned with whatever is agreed in PKIX for use in
   CAA.

2.2.8.  Statement: TLS: <level>

   Specifies the use of TLS:

   refused  Use of TLS is not supported.

   unknown  Use of TLS is unkown.

   optional  Use of TLS is optional.

   required  Use of TLS is required.

   strict  Use of TLS is required with Strict Transport Security.

   Additional parameters MAY be specified to further control the mode of
   use of TLS.  For example the minimum version of the protocol to be
   used.  [[While this could be extended to include cipher suites it is
   believed that the existing protocol is sufficiently proofed against
   downgrade attack on cipher suites.  If this should be found not to be
   the case it would likely drive an urgent update of the protocol
   version.]]

2.2.8.1.  version=<version>

   Specifies the minimum version of TLS to be used in a format that I am
   sure someone will advise me on.
