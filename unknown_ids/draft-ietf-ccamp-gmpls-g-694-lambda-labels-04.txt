Abstract 
 
   Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving and as a 
   consequence new equipment providing lambda switching capability has 
   been developed and is currently being deployed. However, RFC 3471 has 
   defined that a wavelength label (section 3.2.1.1) "only has 
   significance between two neighbors" and global wavelength continuity 
   is not considered. In order to achieve interoperability in a network 
   composed of next generation lambda switch-capable equipment, this 
   document defines a standard lambda label format, being compliant with 
   ITU-T G.694. Moreover some consideration on how to ensure lambda 
   continuity with RSVP-TE is provided. This document is a companion to 
   the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling. It 
   defines the label format when Lambda Switching is requested in an all 
   optical network.

1. Introduction 
 
   As described in [RFC3945], Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extends MPLS from 
   supporting only packet (Packet Switching Capable - PSC) interfaces 
   and switching to also include support for four new classes of 
   interfaces and switching: 
      o Layer-2 Switch Capable (L2SC) 
      o Time-Division Multiplex (TDM) 
      o Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) 
      o Fiber-Switch Capable (FSC). 
   A functional description of the extensions to MPLS signaling needed 
   to support new classes of interfaces and switching is provided in 
   [RFC3471]. 
 
   This document presents details that are specific to the use of GMPLS 
   with a new generation of Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) equipment.  
   Technologies such as Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplex 
   (ROADM) and Wavelength Cross-Connect (WXC) operate at the wavelength 
   switching level. As such, the wavelength is important information 
   that is necessary to set up a wavelength-based LSP appropriately and 
   the wavelength defined in [G.694] is widely utilized. 
 
 
2. Conventions used in this document 
 
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   Figure 1 depicts an all-optically switched network consisting of 
   different vendor's optical network domains. Vendor A's network 
   consists of ROADM or WXC, and vendor B's network consists of PXCs and 
   DWDMs, otherwise both vendors' networks might be based on the same 
   technology. 
 
   In this case, the use of standardized wavelength label information is 
   quite significant to establish a wavelength-based LSP. It is also an 
   important constraint when conducting CSPF calculation for RSVP-TE 
   signaling. The way the CSPF is performed is outside the scope of this 
   document, but defined in [GMPLS-CSPF]. 
 
   It is needless to say, a LSP must be appropriately provisioned 
   between a selected pair of ports not only within Domain A but also 
   over multiple domains satisfying wavelength constraints. 
 
   Figure 2 illustrates in detail the interconnection between Domain A 
   and Domain B.

           Figure 2 Interconnecting details between two domains. 
    
   In the scenario of Figure 1, consider the setting up of a 
   bidirectional LSP from ingress switch 1 to egress switch 9. In order 
   to satisfy wavelength continuity constraint, a fixed wavelength 
   (lambda 1) needs to be used in domain A and domain B. A Path message 
   will be used for the signaling, the PATH message must contain the 
   upstream label and a label set object; both containing the same 
   lambda. The label set object is made by only one sub channel that 
   must be same as the upstream label. The path setup will continue 
   downstream to switch 9 by configuring each lambda switch based on the 
   wavelength label. This label allows the correct switching of lambda 
   switches and the label contents needs to be used over the inter-
   domain. As same above, the path setup will continue downstream to 
   switch 9 by configuring lambda switch based on multiple wavelength 
   labels. If the node has a tunable wavelength transponder, the tuning 
   wavelength is considered as a part of wavelength switching operation. 
 
   Not using a standardized label would add undue burden on the operator 
   to enforce policy as each manufacturer may decide on a different 
   representation and therefore each domain may have its own label 
   formats. Moreover, manual provisioning may lead to misconfiguration 
   if domain-specific labels are used. 
 
   Therefore, a wavelength label should be standardized in order to 
   allow interoperability between multiple domains; otherwise 
   appropriate existing labels are identified in support of wavelength 
   availability. As identical wavelength information, the ITU-T 
   frequency grid specified in [G.694.1] for Dense WDM (DWDM) and 
   wavelength information in [G.694.2] for Coarse WDM (CWDM) are used by 
   LSRs and should be followed as a wavelength label.

4. Label Related Formats  
 
   To deal with the widening scope of MPLS into the optical and time 
   domains, several new forms of "label" have been defined in [RFC3471]. 
   This section contains clarifications for the Wavelength label based 
   on [G.694] and Label Set definition specific for LSC LSRs. 
 
   4.1 Wavelength Labels 
 
   In section 3.2.1.1 of [RFC3471], a Wavelength label is defined to 
   have significance between two neighbors, and the receiver may need to 
   convert the received value into a value that has local significance. 
 
   LSC equipment uses multiple wavelengths controlled by a single 
   control channel. In such case, the label indicates the wavelength to 
   be used for the LSP. This document proposes to standardize the 
   wavelength label.  As an example of wavelength values, the reader is 
   referred to [G.694.1] which lists the frequencies from the ITU-T DWDM 
   frequency grid.  The same can be done for CWDM technology by using 
   the wavelength defined in [G.694.2]. In that sense, we can call G.694 
   wavelength labels. 
 
   Since the ITU-T DWDM grid is based on nominal central frequencies, we 
   need to indicate the appropriate table, the channel spacing in the 
   grid and a value n that allows the calculation of the frequency.  
   That value can be positive or negative. 
 
   The frequency is calculated as such in [G.694.1]: 
 
      Frequency (THz) = 193.1 THz + n * channel spacing (THz) 
 
   , where n is a two's-complement integer (positive, negative or 0) and 
   channel spacing is defined to be 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05 or 0.1 THz. When 
   wider channel spacing such as 0.2 THz is utilized, the combination of 
   narrower channel spacing and the value n can provide proper frequency 
   with that channel spacing. Channel spacing is not utilized to 
   indicate the LSR capability but only to specify a frequency in 
   signaling. 
 
   For the other example of the case of the ITU-T CWDM grid, the spacing 
   between different channels was defined to be 20nm, so we need to pass 
   the wavelength value in nm in this case.  Examples of CWDM 
   wavelengths are 1471, 1491, etc. nm. 
    
   The wavelength is calculated as follows 
    
      Wavelength (nm) = 1471 nm + n * 20 nm 
 
   , where n is a two's-complement integer (positive, negative or 0).The 
   tables listed in [G.694.1] and [G.694.2] are not numbered and change 
   with the changing frequency spacing as technology advances, so an 
   index is not appropriate in this case.

   as above needs to be defined.

Appendix A. DWDM Example 
    
   Considering the network displayed in figure 1 it is possible to show 
   an example of LSP set up using the lambda labels. 
    
   Node 1 receives the request for establishing an LSP from itself to 
   Node 9. The ITU-T grid to be used is the DWDM one, the channel 
   spacing is 50Ghz and the wavelength to be used is 193,35 THz. 
    
   Node 1 signals the LSP via a Path message including a Wavelength 
   Label structured as defined in section 4.2: 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3

   Where: 
    
   Grid = 1 : ITU-T DWDM grid 
   C.S. = 2 : 50 GHz channel spacing 
   n    = 5 :  
    
        Frequency (THz) = 193.1 THz + n * channel spacing (THz) 
         
        193.35 (THz) = 193.1 (THz) + n* 0.05 (THz) 
         
        n = (193.35-193.1)/0.05 = 5 
    
    
Appendix B. CWDM Example 
    
   The network displayed in figure 1 can be used also to display an 
   example of signaling using the Wavelength Label in a CWDM  
   environment. 
    
   This time the signaling of an LSP from Node 4 to Node 7 is  
   considered. Such LSP exploits the CWDM ITU-T grid with a 20nm  
   channel spacing and is to established using wavelength equal to 1331 
   nm. 
    
   Node 4 signals the LSP via a Path message including a Wavelength 
   Label structured as defined in section 4.3: 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      |Grid | C.S   |    Reserved     |              n                | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   Where: 
    
   Grid = 2 : ITU-T CWDM grid 
   C.S. = 1 : 20 nm channel spacing 
   n    = -7 :  
    
        Wavelength (nm) = 1471 nm + n * 20 nm 
         
        1331 (nm) = 1471 (nm) + n * 20 nm 
         
        n = (1331-1471)/20 = -7
