    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
		<t>
			The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) <xref format="default"
			pageno="false" target="RFC4975" /> expects to use MSRP relays
			<xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4976" /> as a means for 
			Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal and policy enforcement.
			However, many Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref format="default"
			pageno="false" target="RFC3261" /> networks, which deploy MSRP, contain 
			middleboxes.  These middleboxes anchor and control media, perform tasks 
			such as NAT traversal, performance monitoring, lawful intercept, address 
			domain bridging, interconnect Service Layer Agreement (SLA) policy 
			enforcement, and so on.  One example is the Interconnection Border Control 
			Function (IBCF) <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="GPP23228" />, 
			defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The IBCF controls a
			media relay that handles all types of SIP session media such as voice, video, 
			MSRP, etc.
		</t>
		<t>
			MSRP, as defined in RFC 4975 <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
			target="RFC4975" /> and RFC 4976 <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
			target="RFC4976" />, cannot anchor through middleboxes.  The reason is that 
			MSRP messages have routing information embedded in the message. Without an 
			extension such as CEMA, middleboxes must read the message to change the routing
			information. This occurs because middleboxes modify the address:port information 
			in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
			target="RFC4566" /> c/m-line in order to anchor media. Since the active MSRP UA 
			establishes the MSRP TCP or TLS connection based on the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path
			attribute, this means that the MSRP connection will not, unless the middlebox also 
			modifies the MSRP URI of the topmost SDP a=path attribute, be routed through the 
			middlebox. In many scenarios this will prevent the MSRP connection from being 
			established. In addition, if the middlebox modifies the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path
			attribute, then the MSRP URI comparison procedure <xref format="default"
			pageno="false" target="RFC4975" />, which requires consistency between the address 
			information in the MSRP messages and the address information carried in the MSRP URI 
			of the SDP a=path attribute, will fail.
		</t>
		<t>
			The only way to achieve interoperability in this situation is for the middlebox 
			to act as a MSRP back-to-back User Agent (B2BUA). Here the MSRP B2BUA acts as the 
			endpoint for the MSRP signaling and media, performs the corresponding modification 
			in the associated MSRP messages, and originates a new MSRP session towards the actual remote
			endpoint. However, the enabling of MSRP B2BUA functionality requires substantially more 
			resource usage in the middlebox, that normally result in negative performance impact. 
			In addition, the MSRP message needs to be exposed in clear text to the MSRP B2BUA, which 
			violates the end-to-end principle <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3724"/> .
		</t>
		<t>
			This specification defines an MSRP extension, Connection Establishment for Media 
			Anchoring (CEMA). CEMA in most cases allows MSRP endpoints to communicate through 
			middleboxes, as defined in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="S.conventions"/>, 
			without a need for the middleboxes to be a MSRP B2BUA. In such cases, middleboxes, that 
			want to anchor the MSRP connection simply modify the SDP c/m-line address information, 
			similar to what it does for non-MSRP media types. MSRP endpoints that support the CEMA 
			extension will use the SDP c/m-line address information for establishing the TCP or TLS 
			connection for sending and receiving MSRP messages.
		</t>
		<t>
			The CEMA extension is fully backward compatible. In scenarios where
			MSRP endpoints do not support the CEMA extension, an MSRP endpoint
			that supports the CEMA extension behaves in the same way as an MSRP
			endpoint that does not support it. The CEMA extension only provides
			an alternative mechanism for negotiating and providing address
			information for the MSRP TCP connection. After the creation of the
			MSRP connection, an MSRP endpoint that supports the CEMA extension 
			acts according to the procedures for creating MSRP messages, performing 
			checks when receiving MSRP messages defined in RFC 4975 and, when it 
			is using a relay for MSRP communications, RFC 4976.

			Fingerprint Based TLS Authentication:  An MSRP endpoint that uses a

			in SDP.
		</t>
		<t>
			Name Based TLS Authentication:  An MSRP endpoint that uses a
			certificate from a well known certificate authority and the

			received in the MSRP URI in SDP.
		</t>
		<t>
			B2BUA: This is an abbreviation for back-to-back user agent.
		</t>
		<t>   
			MSRP B2BUA: A network element that terminates a MSRP connection from one 
			MSRP endpoint and reoriginates that connection towards another MSRP 
			endpoint. Note the MSRP B2BUA is distinct from a SIP B2BUA. A SIP B2BUA 
			terminates a SIP session and reoriginates that session towards another SIP 
			endpoint. In the context of MSRP, a SIP endpoint initiates a SIP session
			towards another SIP endpoint. However, that INVITE may go through, for 
			example, an outbound Proxy or inbound Proxy to route to the remote SIP 
			endpoint. As part of that SIP session a MSRP session, that may follow 
			the SIP session path, is negotiated. However, there is no requirement 
			to co-locate the SIP network elements with the MSRP network elements.
		</t>
		<t>
			TLS B2BUA: A network element that terminates security associations (SAs)
			from endpoints, and establishes separate SAs between itself and each endpoint.
		</t>
		<t>
			Middlebox:  A SIP network device that modifies SDP media address:port
			information in order to steer or anchor media flows described in
			the SDP, including TCP and TLS connections used for MSRP communication,
			through a media proxy function controlled by the SIP endpoint.
			In most cases the media proxy function relays the MSRP messages
			without modification, while in some circumstances it acts as a
			MSRP B2BUA.  Other SIP related functions, such as related to
			routing, modification of SIP information etc, performed by the
			Middlebox, and whether it acts a SIP B2BUA or not, is outside
			the scope of this document. Section 5 describes additional
			assumptions regarding how the Middlebox handles MSRP in order to
			support the extension defined in this document.

    </section>

    <section title="Applicability Statement" toc="default">
		<t>
			This document defines an Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
			extension, Connection Establishment for Media Anchoring (CEMA). 
			Support of the extension is optional. The extension allows 
			Middleboxes to anchor the MSRP connection, without the need for 
			Middleboxes to modify the MSRP messages, and thus also enables a 
			secure end-to-end MSRP communication in networks where such Middleboxes 
			are deployed. The document also defines a Session Description Protocol 
			(SDP) attribute, a=msrp-cema, that MSRP endpoints use to indicate 
			support of the CEMA extension.
		</t>	  
		<t>
			The CEMA extension is primarily intended for MSRP endpoints that
			operate in networks in which Middleboxes that want to anchor media
			connections are deployed, without the need for the Middleboxes to
			enable MSRP B2BUA functionality.  An example of such network is the
			IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) defined by the 3rd Generation
			Partnership Project (3GPP), which also has the capability for all 
			endpoints to use Name-based TLS Authentication. The extension is also 
			useful for other MSRP endpoints operating in other networks, but that 
			communicate with MSRP endpoints in networks with such Middleboxes, 
			unless there is a gateway between the networks that by default always 
			enable MSRP B2BUA functionality.
		</t>
		<t>
			This document assumes certain behaviors on the part of Middleboxes, as 
			described in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="S.assumption"/>. 
			These behaviors are not standardized. If Middleboxes do not behave as assumed, 
			then the CEMA extension does not add any value over base MSRP behavior. MSRP 
			endpoints that support CEMA are required to use RFC 4975 behavior in cases 
			where they detect that the CEMA extension cannot be enabled.

			<t>
				This section defines how an MSRP endpoint that supports the CEMA
				extension generates SDP offers and answers for MSRP, and what SDP
				information elements the MSRP endpoint uses when creating the TCP
				or TLS connection for the MSRP messages.
			</t>
			<t>
				In the following cases, where there is a Middlebox in the network, the 
				CEMA extension can not be used, and there will be a fallback to
				the MSRP connection establishment procedures defined in RFC 4975 and 
				RFC 4976:
			</t>
			<t>
				- A non-CEMA-enabled MSRP endpoint becomes "active" (no matter whether it uses
				a relay for its MSRP communication or not), as it will always establish 
				the MSRP connection using the SDP a=path attribute, which contains the address 
				information of the remote MSRP endpoint, instead of using the SDP c/m-line which contains 
				the address information of the Middlebox.
			</t>
			<t>				
				- A non-CEMA-enabled MSRP endpoint that uses a relay for its MSRP communication 
				becomes "passive", as it can not be assumed that the MSRP endpoint inserts the address 
				information of the relay in the SDP c/m-line.
			</t>
			<t>
				- A CEMA-enabled MSRP endpoint that uses a relay for its MSRP communication becomes 
				"active", since if it adds the received SDP c/m-line address information to the ToPath 
				header field of the MSRP message (in order for the relay to establish the MSRP connection 
				towards the Middlebox), the session matching performed by the remote MSRP endpoint will fail.

		<section anchor="S.offerer" title="MSRP Offer Procedures" toc="default">

				When a CEMA-enabled MSRP endpoint sends an SDP offer for MSRP, it
				generates the SDP offer according to the procedures in RFC 4975.  In
				addition, the endpoint follows RFC 4976 if it is using a relay for
				MSRP communication.  The endpoint also performs the following
				additions and modifications:
			</t>	  
			<t>
				1.  The MSRP endpoint MUST include an SDP a=msrp-cema attribute in
				the MSRP media description of the SDP offer.
			</t>	  
			<t>
				2.  If the MSRP endpoint is not using a relay for MSRP communication,
				it MUST include an SDP a=setup attribute in the MSRP media
				description of the SDP offer, according to the procedures in RFC
				6135 <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC6135" />.
			</t>	  
			<t>
				3.  If the MSRP endpoint is using a relay for MSRP communication, it
				MUST include the address information of the relay (the MSRP URI
				of the topmost SDP a=path attribute), rather than the address
				information of itself, in the SDP c/m-line associated with the
				MSRP media description. In addition, it MUST include an SDP
				a=setup:actpass attribute in the MSRP media description of the
				SDP offer.
			</t>	  
			<t>
				If the MSRP media description of the SDP answer does not contain an 
				SDP a=msrp-cema attribute, the MSRP endpoint MUST check the criteria below.
				If either or all of the criteria is met, the MSRP endpoint MUST 
				fallback to RFC 4975 behavior, by sending a new SDP offer according to 
				the procedures in RFC 4975 and RFC 4976. The new offer MUST NOT contain 
				an SDP a=msrp-cema attribute.
			</t>	  
			<t>
				1. The SDP c/m-line address information associated with the MSRP
				media description does not match the information in the MSRP URI
				of the a=path attribute(s) (in which case is assumed that 
				the SDP c/m-line contains the address to a Middlebox), and the MSRP
				endpoint will become "passive" (if the MSRP media description of 
				the SDP answer contains an SDP a=setup:active attribute).
			</t>	  
			<t>
				2. The MSRP endpoint uses a relay for its MSRP communication, 
				the SDP c/m-line address information associated with the MSRP
				media description does not match the information in the MSRP URI
				of the SDP a=path attribute(s) (in which case is assumed that 
				the SDP c/m-line contains the address to a Middlebox), and the 
				MSRP endpoint will become "active" (either by default or if the 
				MSRP media description of the SDP answer contains an SDP 
				a=setup:passive attribute).
			</t>	  
			<t>
				3. The remote MSRP endpoint uses a relay for its MSRP communication,
				the SDP c/m-line address information associated with the MSRP
				media description does not match the information in the MSRP URI
				of the SDP a=path attributes (in which case is assumed that 
				the SDP c/m-line contains the address to a Middlebox), and the MSRP 
				endpoint will become "active" (either by default or if the MSRP media 
				description of the SDP answer contains an SDP a=setup:passive attribute).
			</t>	  
			<t>
				NOTE: As described in section 5, in the absence of the SDP a=msrp-cema 
				attribute in the new offer, it is assumed that a Middlebox will act as 
				an MSRP B2BUA in order to anchor MSRP media. 
			</t>	  
			<t>
				The MSRP endpoint MAY choose to terminate the session establishment 
				if it can detect that a Middlebox acting as a MSRP B2BUA is not the 
				desired remote endpoint.
			</t>	  
			<t>
				The MSRP endpoint can send the new offer within the existing early
				dialog <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3261" />, or it can 
				terminate the early dialog and establish a new dialog by sending the new 
				offer in a new initial INVITE request.
			</t>	  
			<t>
				If the remote MSRP endpoint uses a relay for its MSRP communication, and the 
				SDP c/m-line address information associated with the MSRP media description 
				matches one of the SDP a=path attributes, it is assumed that there is no 
				Middlebox in the network. In that case the MSRP endpoint MUST fallback to RFC 4975
				behavior, but it does not need to send a new SDP offer.
			</t>
			<t>
				In other cases, where none of the criteria above is met, and where the MSRP 
				endpoint becomes "active", it MUST use the SDP c/m-line for establishing the 
				MSRP TCP connection. If the MSRP endpoint becomes "passive", it will wait for 
				the remote MSRP endpoint to establish the TCP connection, according to the 
				procedures in RFC 4975.

				the MSRP endpoint MUST either reject the offered MSRP connection
				(by using a zero port value number in the generated SDP answer), or 
				reject the whole SDP offer carrying SIP request with a 488 Not 
				Acceptable Here <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3261" />

				1. Both MSRP endpoints are using relays for their MSRP communication.

				3. The MSRP endpoint uses a relay for MSRP communication and is not

				is now allowed to include an SDP a=setup:passive attribute in an SDP offer, 
				as described in RFC 6135.

		<section title="Usage With the Alternative Connection Model" toc="default">
			<t>
				An MSRP endpoint that supports the CEMA extension MUST support the
				mechanism defined in RFC 6135, as it extends the number of scenarios
				where one can use the CEMA extension. An example is where a MSRP
				endpoint is using a relay for MSRP communication, and it needs to be
				"passive" in order to use the CEMA extension, instead of doing a
				fallback to RFC 4975 behavior.
			</t>
		</section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="S.assumption" title="Middlebox Assumptions" toc="default">
		<section title="General" toc="default">
			<t>
				This document does not specify explicit Middlebox behavior, even
				though Middleboxes enable some of the procedures described here.   
				However, as MSRP endpoints are expected to operate in networks 
				where Middleboxes that want to anchor media are present,
				this document makes certain assumptions regarding to how such
				Middleboxes behave.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="MSRP Awareness" toc="default">
			<t>
				In order to support interoperability between UAs that support the
				CEMA extension and UAs that do not support the extension, the
				Middlebox is MSRP aware.  This means that it implements MSRP B2BUA
				functionality. The Middlebox enables that functionality in cases
				where the SDP offerer does not support the CEMA extension. In
				cases where the SDP offer indicates support of the CEMA extension,
				the Middlebox can simply modify the SDP c/m-line address information
				for the MSRP connection.
			</t>
			<t>
				If the Middlebox does not implement MSRP B2BUA functionality, or does 
				not enable it when the SDP a=msrp-cema attribute is not present in the
				SDP offer, CEMA-enabled MSRP endpoints will is some cases be unable to 
				interoperate with non-CEMA-enabled endpoints across the Middlebox.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="TCP Connection Reuse" toc="default">
			<t>
				Middleboxes do not need to parse and modify the MSRP payload when
				endpoints use the CEMA extension. A Middlebox that does not parse
				the MSRP payload probably will not be able to reuse TCP connections
				for multiple MSRP sessions. Instead, in order to associate an MSRP message 
				with a specific session, the Middlebox often assigns a unique local 
				address:port combination for each MSRP session. Due to this, between two 
				Middleboxes there might be a separate connection for each MSRP session.
			</t>
			<t>
				If the Middlebox does not assign a unique address:port combination for 
				each MSRP session, and does not parse MSRP messages, it might end up forwarding 
				MSRP messages towards the wrong destination.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="SDP Integrity" toc="default">
			<t>
				This document assumes that Middleboxes are able to modify the SDP
				address information associated with the MSRP media.  Middleboxes
				cannot be deployed in environments that require end-to-end SDP
				protection using SIP identity <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
				target="RFC4916" />.
			</t>
			<t>
				If the Middlebox is unable to modify SDP payloads due to end-to-end 
				integrity protection, it will be either unable to anchor MSRP media, 
				or the SIP signaling might fail due to integrity violations.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="TLS" toc="default">
			<t>
				When UAs use the CEMA extension, this document assumes that Middleboxes 
				relay MSRP media packets at the transport layer. The TLS handshake and resulting 
				security association (SA) can be established peer-to-peer between the MSRP endpoints.  
				The Middlebox will see encrypted MSRP media packets, but is unable to 
				inspect the clear text content.
			</t>
			<t>
				When UAs fallback to RFC 4975 behavior Middleboxes act as TLS B2BUAs.				
				The Middlebox decrypts MSRP media packets received from one MSRP endpoint, and 
				then re-encrypts them before sending them toward the other MSRP endpoint. 
				Middleboxes can inspect and modify the MSRP message content. As CEMA does not
				require a Middlebox to modify the MSRP content, this can be prevented if TLS is 
				used for the MSRP communication, assuming that the SIP signalling channel is 
				end-to-end integrity protected.
			</t>
		</section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-security" title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
		<section anchor="sec-security-mitm" title="Man in the Middle" toc="default">
			<t>
				In some cases, where MSRP B2BUA functionality does not need to be
				enabled, the CEMA extension makes it easier for a man in the middle
				(MiTM) to transparently insert itself in the communication between
				MSRP endpoints in order to monitor or record unprotected MSRP
				communication. It does not however make it easier for a MiTM to
				monitor TLS protected MSRP, or in any significant way modify TLS
				protected MSRP content or even find out that the packets contain MSRP
				messages, since that would require the MiTM to implement MSRP B2BUA
				functionality, no matter if UAs support the CEMA extension or not.
				It would thus require the MiTM to terminate the TCP/TLS/MSRP
				connection in both directions. MSRP endpoints SHOULD use encrypted 
				channels, if possible. For backward compability, a CEMA-enabled MSRP 
				endpoint MUST implement TLS.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sec-security-tls" title="TLS Usage" toc="default">
			<t>
				The CEMA extension supports the usage of name-based authentication
				for TLS in the presence of Middleboxes.
			</t>
			<t>
				If a Middlebox acts as a TLS B2BUA, MSRP endpoints will be able to
				use fingerprint based authentication and name-based authentication for 
				TLS, no matter if they support the CEMA extension or not. In such cases, 
				as the Middlebox acts as TLS endpoints, MSRP endpoints might be given an 
				incorrect impression that there is an end-to-end security association (SA)
				between the MSRP endpoints.
			</t>
			<t>
				If a Middlebox does not act as a TLS B2BUA, fingerprint based
				authentication will not work, as the "SIP Identity" based integrity
				protection of SDP will break. Therefore, in addition to the		
				authentication mechanisms defined in RFC 4975, it is RECOMMENDED 
				that a CEMA-enabled MSRP endpoint also supports one of the following
				authentication mechanisms, that do not rely on peer-to-peer SDP integrity:
			</t>
			<t>
				1.  TLS certificates together with support of interacting with a
				Certificate Management Service <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
				target="RFC6072" />, to which it publishes the public version of its 
				own self-signed certificate and from which it fetches on demand the 
				public certificates of other endpoints.
			</t>
			<t>
				2.  TLS-PSK managed by MIKEY-TICKET Based Key Management and Key
				Management Service <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC6043" />.  
				Note that 3GPP has specified the MIKEY-TICKET based Key Management and Key 
				Management Service authentication mechanism for the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).
				Thus it will be available in that environment.
			</t>
			<t>
				When an MSRP endpoint generates an SDP offer for MSRPS, in addition
				to the SDP attributes associated with the TLS authentication
				mechanisms described in RFC 4975, it MUST include any information
				elements associated with the other authentication mechanisms that it
				supports.
			</t>
			<t>
				If possible, MSRP endpoints MUST use name-based authentication.
				If not possible, if the MSRP endpoints support a common authentication 
				mechanism, they MUST use that mechanism. If the MSRP endpoints do not 
				support such common authentication mechanism, they MUST try fingerprint-based
				authentication, which will succeed if there are no Middleboxes
				present. If that also fails, the MSRP endpoints MUST either:
			</t>
			<t>
				1.  Consider the TLS authentication as failed, in accordance with RFC
				4975; or
			</t>
			<t>
				2. If the SIP signaling is integrity protected between the endpoint and 
				network elements on a hop-by-hop basis, typically through use of IPsec or 
				TLS transport, then an endpoint can depending on local policy chose to trust 
				the network endpoints in the signalling path for SDP integrity and accept 
				fingerprint based TLS authentication without requiring end-to-end SDP integrity.
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE: As defined in RFC 4975, if TLS authentication fails, the user
				need to be able to decide whether to try to anyway establish a
				connection with unprotected MSRP media.
			</t>

		<section anchor="sec-security-tls-insec" title="TLS and Insecure Signaling" toc="default">
			<t>
				One of the side effects of relieving Middleboxes from manipulating message content 
				is CEMA provides an environment necessary for end-to-end integrity of MSRP media. 
			</t>
			<t>
				CEMA recommends using an integrity-protected media channel, such as TLS.
				As defined in RFC 4975, all MSRP endpoints MUST support TLS. That applies also to
				CEMA-enabled endpoints.
			</t>
			<t>
				One issue with usage of TLS is the availability of a certificate infrastructure.  
				Endpoints can always provide self-signed certificates. However, this is problematic in 
				that any endpoint can masquerade as another, by providing a self-signed certificate with 
				the victim's information.
			</t>
			<t>
				One of the target deployments for CEMA is the 3GPP IMS SIP network. In this environment 
				service providers provision signed certificates or manage signed certificates on behalf of 
				their subscribers. This does require trusting the service provider, but those issues are 
				beyond the scope of this document.
			</t>
			<t>
				Alternate key distribution mechanisms, such as DANE <xref target="DANE" />, 
				PGP <xref target="RFC6091" />, or some other technology, might become ubiquitous enough 
				to solve the key distribution problem in the future.
			</t>
			<t>
				Even with seemingly end-to-end media integrity, at the time of the publication of this document 
				there are other vulnerabilities in MSRP, due to vulnerabilities in the SIP signaling. If there 
				are no integrity protections on the SIP signaling, it is easy to insert malicious middleboxes 
				to alter, record, or otherwise harm the media. With insecure signaling, it can be difficult 
				for an endpoint to even be aware the remote endpoint has any relationship to the expected 
				endpoint. Securing the SIP signaling does not solve all problems. For example, in a SIPS 
				environment, the endpoints have no cryptographic way of validating that one or more SIP 
				Proxies in the proxy chain are not, in fact, malicious.
