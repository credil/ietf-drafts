1.  Introduction

   MS/TP (Master-Slave/Token-Passing) is a contention-free access method
   for the [TIA-485-A] physical layer that is used extensively in
   building automation networks.  This document describes the frame
   format for transmission of IPv6 [RFC2460] packets and the method of
   forming link-local and statelessly autoconfigured IPv6 addresses on
   MS/TP networks.  The general approach is to adapt elements of the
   6LoWPAN [RFC4944] specification to constrained wired networks.

   An MS/TP device is typically based on a low-cost microcontroller with
   limited processing power and/or memory.  Together with low data rates
   and a small address space, these constraints are similar to those
   faced in 6LoWPAN networks and suggest some elements of that solution
   might be applied.  MS/TP differs significantly from 6LoWPAN in at
   least three respects: a) MS/TP devices typically have a continuous
   source of power, b) all MS/TP devices on a segment can communicate
   directly so there are no hidden node or mesh routing issues, and c)
   proposed changes to MS/TP will support payloads of up to 1500 octets
   without the need for MAC-layer fragmentation and reassembly.

   The following sections provide a brief overview of MS/TP, then
   describe how to form IPv6 addresses and encapsulate IPv6 packets in
   MS/TP frames.  This document also defines mechanisms for header
   compression required to make IPv6 practical on MS/TP networks based
   on [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc].

1.3.  MS/TP Overview

   This section provides a brief overview of MS/TP, which is specified
   in Clause 9 of ANSI/ASHRAE 135-2010 [BACnet] and included herein by
   reference.  [BACnet] also covers physical layer deployment options.

   MS/TP is designed to enable multidrop networks over shielded twisted
   pair wiring.  It can support segments up to 1200 meters in length or
   data rates up to 115,200 baud (at this data rate the segment length
   is limited to 1000 meters).  An MS/TP link requires only a UART, a
   5ms resolution timer, and a [TIA-485-A] transceiver with a driver
   that can be disabled.  These features combine to make MS/TP a cost-
   effective field bus for the most numerous and least expensive devices
   in a building automation network.

   The differential signaling used by [TIA-485-A] requires a contention-
   free MAC.  MS/TP uses a token to control access to a bus network.  A
   master node may initiate the transmission of a data frame when it
   holds the token.  After sending at most a configured maximum number
   of data frames, a master node pasess the token to the next master
   node.  (Slave nodes transmit only when polled and are not considered
   part of this specification.)

   MS/TP frames have the following format*:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   *Note: The Data and Data CRC fields are present only if Length is
    non-zero.  A BACnet proposal now under review assigns a new Frame
    Type for IPv6, sets the maximum length of the Data field to 1500
    octets, and replaces the 16-bit Data CRC with a 32-bit Data CRC.

   The MS/TP frame fields have the following descriptions:

     Preamble             two octet preamble: 0x55, 0xFF
     Frame Type           one octet
     Destination Address  one octet node identifier
     Source Address       one octet node identifier
     Length               two octets, most significant octet first
     Header CRC           one octet
     Data                 0 - 1500 octets*
                          (present only if Length is non-zero)
     Data CRC             four octets*, least significant octet first
                          (present only if Length is non-zero)
     (pad)                (optional) at most one octet of trailer: 0xFF


   The Frame Type is used to distinguish between different types of MAC
   frames.  Currently defined types (in decimal) are:

     00  Token
     01  Poll For Master
     02  Reply To Poll For Master
         ...
     10  IPv6 over MS/TP Encapsulation*

   Frame Types 11 through 127 are reserved for assignment by ASHRAE.
   Frame Types 128 through 255 are available to vendors for proprietary
   frames.  Token, Poll For Master, and Reply to Poll For Master frames
   MUST be understood by all master nodes.  See Section 2 for additional
   details.

   The Destination and Source Addresses are each one octet in length.
   See Section 3 for additional details.

   The Length field specifies the length in octets of the Data field and
   is transmitted most significant octet first.  See Section 4 for
   additional details.

   The Header CRC field covers the Frame Type, Destination Address,
   Source Address, and Length fields.

   The Data and Data CRC fields are conditional on the Frame Type and
   the Length.  The Data and Data CRC fields are always present in
   frames specified by this document. *See previous note regarding the
   [BACnet] change proposal to support IPv6 over MS/TP.

   The Header and Data CRC generation and check procedures are specified
   in [BACnet] and exended by the proposal.

2.  MS/TP Mode for IP

   The [BACnet] MS/TP change proposal now under review allocates a new
   Frame Type from the reserved range to indicate IPv6 encapsulation.
   The new Frame Type for IPv6 over MS/TP Encapsulation (LoBAC) is 10.

   All MS/TP master devices (including those that support IPv6) must
   understand Token, Poll For Master, and Reply to Poll For Master
   frames and support the Receive Frame and Master Node state machines
   specified in [BACnet] and extended by the proposal.


3.  Addressing Modes

   MS/TP Destination and Source Addresses are one octet in length.  A
   Destination Address of 255 (0xFF) denotes a link-level broadcast (all
   nodes).  All IPv6 multicast packets MUST be sent to Destination
   Address 255 and filtered at the IPv6 layer.  A Source Address of 255
   MUST NOT be used.

   [BACnet] specifies that addresses 0 to 127 are valid for master
   nodes.  However, this specification restricts the allowable unicast
   address range to between 1 and 127, inclusive.  Zero MUST NOT be used
   as either a Destination Address or Source Address.

   The assignment of node addresses (identifiers) is outside the scope
   of this document.  Each node must have a unique identifier on the
   link or a misconfiguration condition exists.

   This document assumes that each MS/TP link maps to a unique IPv6
   subnet prefix.  Hosts learn IPv6 prefixes via router advertisements
   according to [RFC4861].  MS/TP does not support multicast, therefore
   IPv6-level multicast packets MUST be carried as link-layer broadcast
   frames in MS/TP networks.


4.  Maximum Transmission Unit

   The [BACnet] MS/TP change proposal now under review requires that the
   MSDU be increased to 1500 octets and covered by a 32-bit CRC.  This
   is sufficient to convey an MTU of at least 1280 octets as required by
   IPv6 and eliminates the need for MAC-layer fragmentation and
   reassembly.

   However, the relatively low data rates of MS/TP still make a
   compelling case for header compression.  Since it is expected that
   many (if not all) applications of IPv6 over MS/TP will make use of
   header compression, an adaptation layer to compress and decompress

   IPv6 headers is specified below in Section 5 and the compression
   scheme is specified in Section 9.


5.  LoBAC Adaptation Layer

   The encapsulation formats defined in this section (subsequently
   referred to as the "LoBAC encapsulation") comprise the payload (MSDU)
   of an MS/TP frame.  The LoBAC payload (e.g., an IPv6 packet) follows
   an encapsulation header stack.  LoBAC is a subset of the LoWPAN
   encapsulation defined in [RFC4944].  Use of the "LOWPAN" prefix where
   it appears below is therefore intentional.  The primary differences
   are a) elimination of the mesh, broadcast, and fragmentation headers,
   and b) use of LOWPAN_IPHC compression [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc].

   All LoBAC encapsulated datagrams transported over MS/TP are prefixed
   by an encapsulation header stack.  Each header in the header stack
   contains a header type followed by zero or more header fields.
   Whereas in an IPv6 header the stack would contain, in the following
   order, addressing, hop-by-hop options, routing, fragmentation,
   destination options, and finally payload [RFC2460]; in a LoBAC header
   the analogous header sequence is (optionally) compression and
   payload.  These examples show the header stacks that may be used in a
   LoBAC network.

      A LoBAC encapsulated IPv6 datagram:

        +---------------+-------------+---------+
        | IPv6 Dispatch | IPv6 Header | Payload |
        +---------------+-------------+---------+

      A LoBAC encapsulated LOWPAN_IPHC compressed IPv6 datagram:

        +---------------+-------------+---------+
        | IPHC Dispatch | IPHC Header | Payload |
        +---------------+-------------+---------+

   All protocol datagrams (e.g., IPv6, compressed IPv6 headers, etc.)
   SHALL be preceded by one of the valid LoBAC encapsulation headers,
   examples of which are given above.  This permits uniform software
   treatment of datagrams without regard to the mode of their
   transmission.

   The definition of LoBAC headers consists of the dispatch value, the
   definition of the header fields that follow, and their ordering
   constraints relative to all other headers.  Although the header stack
   structure provides a mechanism to address future demands on the LoBAC
   (LoWPAN) adaptation layer, it is not intended to provided general

   purpose extensibility.  This format document specifies a small set of
   header types using the header stack for clarity, compactness, and
   orthogonality.

5.1.  Dispatch Type and Header

   The dispatch type is defined by a zero bit as the first bit and a one
   bit as the second bit.  The dispatch type and header are shown here:

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |0 1| Dispatch  |  type-specific header
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Dispatch               6-bit selector.  Identifies the type of header
                          immediately following the Dispatch Header.

   type-specific header   A header determined by the Dispatch Header.

                    Figure 2: Dispatch Type and Header


   The dispatch value may be treated as an unstructured namespace.  Only
   a few symbols are required to represent current LoBAC functionality.
   Although some additional savings could be achieved by encoding
   additional functionality into the dispatch octet, these measures
   would tend to constrain the ability to address future alternatives.

          Pattern      Header Type
        +------------+-------------------------------------------------+
        | 00  xxxxxx | NALP        - Not a LoWPAN (LoBAC) frame        |
        | 01  000000 | ESC         - Additional Dispatch octet follows |
        | 01  000001 | IPv6        - Uncompressed IPv6 Addresses       |
        |   ...      | reserved    - Reserved for future use           |
        | 01  1xxxxx | LOWPAN_IPHC - LOWPAN_IPHC compressed IPv6       |
        +------------+-------------------------------------------------+

                   Figure 3: Dispatch Value Bit Pattern

   NALP:  Specifies that the following bits are not a part of the LoBAC
      encapsulation, and any LoBAC node that encounters a dispatch
      value of 00xxxxxx shall discard the packet.  Other non-LoBAC
      protocols that wish to coexist with LoBAC nodes should include an
      octet matching this pattern immediately following the MS/TP
      header.

   ESC:  Specifies that the following header is a single 8-bit field for

      the Dispatch value.  It allows support for Dispatch values larger
      than 127.

   IPv6:  Specifies that the following header is an uncompressed IPv6
      header [RFC2460].

   LOWPAN_IPHC:  A value of 001xxxxx specifies a LOWPAN_IPHC compression
      header (see Section 9.)


6.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

   This section defines how to obtain an IPv6 Interface Identifier.  The
   general procedure is described in Appendix A of [RFC4291], "Creating
   Modified EUI-64 Format Interface Identifiers".

   The Interface Identifier may be based on an [EUI-64] identifier
   assigned to the device.  In this case, the Interface Identifier is
   formed from the EUI-64 by inverting the "u" (universal/local) bit
   according to [RFC4291].  This will result in a globally unique
   Interface Identifier.

   If the device does not have an EUI-64, then the Interface Identifier
   is formed by taking the MS/TP node identifier and concatenating it to
   the seven octets 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFE, 0x00, 0x00.  For
   example, an MS/TP node identifier of hexadecimal value 0x4F results
   in the following Interface Identifier:

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|
   |0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |0000000000000000|0000000011111111|1111111000000000|0000000001001111|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

   Note that this results in the universal/local bit set to "0" to
   indicate local scope.

   A different MAC address set manually or by software MAY be used to
   derive the Interface Identifier.  If such a MAC address is used, its
   global uniqueness property should be reflected in the value of the
   universal/local bit.

   An IPv6 address prefix used for stateless autoconfiguration [RFC4862]
   of an MS/TP interface MUST have a length of 64 bits.

7.  IPv6 Link Local Address

   The IPv6 link-local address [RFC4291] for an MS/TP interface is
   formed by appending the Interface Identifier, as defined above, to
   the prefix FE80::/64.

       10 bits            54 bits                  64 bits
     +----------+-----------------------+----------------------------+
     |1111111010|         (zeros)       |    Interface Identifier    |
     +----------+-----------------------+----------------------------+


8.  Unicast Address Mapping

   The address resolution procedure for mapping IPv6 non-multicast
   addresses into MS/TP link-layer addresses follows the general
   description in Section 7.2 of [RFC4861], unless otherwise specified.

   The Source/Target Link-layer Address option has the following form
   when the link layer is MS/TP and the addresses are 8-bit MS/TP node
   addresses.

                      0                   1
                      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |     Type      |    Length=1   |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |     0x00      | MS/TP Address |

   Option fields:

   Type:

     1: for Source Link-layer address.

     2: for Target Link-layer address.

   Length:  This is the length of this option (including the type and
     length fields) in units of 8 octets.  The value of this field is 1
     for 8-bit MS/TP addresses.

   MS/TP Address:  The 8-bit address in canonical bit order [RFC2469].

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over MS/TP                   July 2011


     This is the address the interface currently responds to.


9.  Header Compression

   LoBAC uses LOWPAN_IPHC IPv6 compression, which is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc] and included herein by reference.  This section
   will simply identify substitutions that should be made when
   interpreting the text of [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc].

   In general the following substitutions should be made:

   *  Replace "6LoWPAN network" with "MS/TP network"

   *  Replace "IEEE 802.15.4 address" with "MS/TP address"

   Where 16-bit addresses are called for (e.g., a short IEEE 802.15.4
   address) they MUST be formed by padding the MS/TP address to the left
   with a zero:

                      0                   1
                      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |     0x00      | MS/TP address |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+---------------+


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses values previously reserved by [RFC4944] and
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc] and makes no further requests of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


11.  Security Considerations

   The method of deriving Interface Identifiers from MAC addresses is
   intended to preserve global uniqueness when possible.  However, there
   is no protection from duplication through accident or forgery.


12.  Acknowledgments

   Thanks are extended to the authors of [RFC4944] and members of the
   IETF 6LoWPAN working group; this document borrows extensively from
   their work.
