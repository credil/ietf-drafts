Abstract

   The File transfer protocol, which is defined by the RFC 959, is
   widely used. RFC 2428 define IPv6 extensions of FTP, introducing EPRT
   and EPSV command.

   In the IPv6-IPv4 translation scenario, considerations should be
   applied to FTP client, server and translation box to ensure FTP
   protocol work properly. There already have some work to address this
   problem, such as "draft-van-beijnum-behave-ftp64-05" etc, but this
   document provides a different approach.

               Figure 1 IPv6-IPv4 translation FTP scenario.

   The IPv6 FTP client situated in an IPv6 network and tries to
   communicate with an IPv4 server that situated in an IPv4 network
   using a translation box in the middle.

   FTP has two operation modes: passive mode and active mode. In passive
   mode, the server provides port used for the client to connect to. In
   active mode, the server connect back to the client, using the IP
   address and port number which provide by the client.

   RFC 2428 specifies IPv6 extension of FTP. Two new commands, EPRT/EPSV
   are specified. The EPRT command is an extension of PORT, it could
   provide IPv6 address and port number to the server. The EPSV command
   is an extension of PASV, when issue this command, the server should
   responses its port number used for the client to connect.

   Many serves do not support EPSV command, but most of them could
   support PASV mode (draft-van-beijnum-behave-ftp64-05). This document
   provides guidelines for client and server to avoid the problems that
   IPv6 FTP client communication with an IPv4 server through a
   translation box.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

3. Client considerations

   It is required that all FTP clients MUST support both EPSV and PASV
   command.

   When the client tries to connect to a server using IPv6 connection,
   it should use EPSV command first. If the server response that it does
   not support this command or encounters an error, it MUST retry with
   PASV command. The serve will respond to PASV command with an message
   that contains an IPv4 address and port number that used for the
   client to connect to. The client MUST ignores the IPv4 address
   provided in the response; it should use the control connection's IP
   address to connect to the server to establish the data connection.
   This approach could simply the FTP client software's implementation.

4. Server considerations

   All FTP servers MUST support EPSV and PASV command. All FTP severs
   MUST could respond with error to EPSV command. The FTP sever MUST
   allow the client to retry with PASV command when fails with EPSV
   command. Also, the serve must allow the client to use the control
   connection's IP address when it retry with PASV command.

5. ALG considerations

   The translation box that situated between the IPv6 network and IPv4
   network should not implement FTP ALG. It is depend on the client and
   serve that comply with this specification to avoid the ALG problem in
   the translation box.

6. Existing solutions and comparison

   [I-D.draft-van-beijnum-behave-ftp64-05] provides a solution that
   addresses same problem as this document, the major differences
   between the two approaches are:

   1. ALG considerations of the translation box

   [I-D.draft-van-beijnum-behave-ftp64-05] does not speak out in favor
   or against the deployment of an FTP application layer gateway.

   However, this document specifies that the translation box should not
   implement FTP ALG.

   The main concern of not recommending ALG is that FTP ALG could
   dramatically decrease the performance of the translation box due to
   the stateful application layer processing. ALG could be avoided by
   the FTP client and server's implantation that complies with this
   document. The argument here is that it is much easier for the
   client/server software to upgrade than implementation of ALG in the
   translation box. Eliminating the ALG function in the translation box
   will simply the protocol operation and avoid unexpected errors.

   2. Behavior of FTP client when retrying with PASV command

   [I-D.draft-van-beijnum-behave-ftp64-05] recommends that the client
   should use the IPv4 address in the PASV response message if it has
   IPv4 connectivity and use the control connection's IP address if it
   does not have IPv4 connectivity. However, this document specifies
   that the client should use the control channel's IP address without
   determination whether it has IPv4 connectivity or not. This will
   simplify the client software, besides, if the client has IPv4
   connectivity, the control channel will use its IPv4 address instead
   of using its IPv6 address to connect to the IPv4 server.
