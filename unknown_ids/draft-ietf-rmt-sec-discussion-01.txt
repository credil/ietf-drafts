Abstract

   This document describes some security risks of the Reliable Multicast
   Transport (RMT) Working Group set of building blocks and protocols.
   An emphasis is placed on risks that might be resolved in the scope of
   transport protocol design.  However, relevant security issues related
   to IP Multicast control-plane and other concerns not strictly within
   the scope of reliable transport protocol design are also discussed.

   The document also begins an exploration of approaches that could be
   embraced to mitigate these risks.  The purpose of this document is to
   provide a consolidated security discussion and provide a basis for
   further discussion and potential resolution of any significant
   security issues that may exist in the current set of RMT standards.

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) Working Group has produced a
   set of building blocks (BB) and protocol instantiation (PI)
   specifications for reliable multicast data transport.  The two PIs
   defined within the scope of RMT: ALC
   [RFC3450][draft-ietf-rmt-pi-alc-revised] and NORM [RFC3940], as well
   as the FLUTE application [RFC3926] built on top of ALC, are "Content
   Delivery Protocols" (CDP)[Neumann05].  In this document the term CDP
   will refer indifferently to either ALC or NORM, with their associated
   BBs.

   The use of these BBs and PIs raises new security risks.  For
   instance, these protocols share a novel set of Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) and congestion control building blocks that present
   some new capabilities for Internet transport, but may also pose some
   new security risks.  Yet some security risks are not related to the
   particular BBs used by the PIs, but are more general.  Reliable
   multicast transport sessions are expected to involve at least one
   sender and multiple receivers.  Thus, the risk of and avenues to
   attack are implicitly greater than that of point-to-point (unicast)
   transport sessions.  Also the nature of IP multicast can expose other
   coexistent network flows and services to risk if malicious users
   exploit it.  The classic any-source multicast (ASM) model of
   multicast routing allows any host to join an IP multicast group and
   send traffic to that group.  This poses many potential security
   challenges.  And, while the emerging source-specific multicast (SSM)
   model that allows only a single sender to send traffic to a group
   simplifies some challenges, there remain some specific issues.  For
   instance, possible areas of attack include those against the control
   plane where malicious hosts join IP multicast groups to cause
   multicast traffic to be directed to parts of the network where it is
   not needed or desired.  This can indirectly cause denial-of-service
   (DoS) to other network flows.  Also, attackers may transmit erroneous
   or corrupt messages to the group or employ strategies such as replay
   attack within the "data plane" of protocol operation.

   The goals of this document are therefore to:

   1.  Define the possible general security goals; i.e., define what we
       want to protect, i.e. the network itself, and/or the protocol,
       and/or the content.

   2.  List the possible elementary security services that will make it
       possible to fulfill the general security goals.  Some of these
       services are generic (e.g. object and/or packet integrity), while
       others are specific to RMT protocols (e.g. congestion control
       specific security schemes).

   3.  List some technological building blocks and solutions that can
       provide the desired security services.

   4.  Highlight the CDP specificities that will impact security and
       define some use-cases.  Indeed, the set of solutions proposed to
       fulfill the security goals will greatly be impacted by the target
       use case.

   In some cases, the existing RMT documents already discuss the risks
   and outline approaches to solve them, at least partially.  The
   purpose of this document is to consolidate this content and provide a
   basis for further discussion and potential resolution of any
   significant security issues that may exist.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology and Notations


2.  Introduction to the RMT Protocols

2.1.  The Two Families of CDP

   The RMT Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC) protocol [RFC3450] is a
   massively scalable reliable content delivery protocol.  ALC combines
   the Layered Coding Transport (LCT) building block [RFC3451], a
   multiple rate congestion control building block and the Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) building block to provide congestion controlled
   reliable asynchronous delivery of content to an unlimited number of
   concurrent receivers from a single sender.

   The Nack-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocol [RFC3940] uses a
   selective, negative acknowledgment mechanism for transport
   reliability and offers additional protocol mechanisms to allow for
   operation with minimal "a priori" coordination among senders and
   receivers.  A congestion control scheme is specified to allow the
   NORM protocol to fairly share available network bandwidth with other
   transport protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  It
   is capable of operating with both reciprocal multicast routing among
   senders and receivers and with asymmetric connectivity (possibly a
   unicast return path) between the senders and receivers.  The protocol
   offers a number of features to allow different types of applications
   or possibly other higher level transport protocols to utilize its
   service in different ways.  The protocol leverages the use of FEC-

   based repair and other IETF reliable multicast transport (RMT)
   building blocks in its design.

2.2.  RMT Protocol Characteristics

   This section focuses on the RMT protocol characteristics that impact
   the choice of the technological building blocks, and the way they can
   be applied.  Both ALC and NORM have been designed with receiver group
   size scalability in mind.  While ALC targets massively scalable
   sessions (e.g. with millions of receivers), NORM is less ambitious,
   essentially because of the use of feedback messages to the source.
   Ideally, the use of security mechanisms should not break these
   scalability features.

   The ALC and NORM protocols differ in the communication paths:

   o  sender to receivers: ALC and NORM, for bulk data transfer and
      signaling messages;

   o  receivers to sender: NORM only, for feedback messages;

   o  receivers to receivers: NORM only for control messages;

   But the fact that ALC is capable of working on top of purely
   unidirectional networks does not mean that no back-channel will be
   available (see Section 2.3).  The NORM and ALC protocols support a
   variety of content delivery models where transport may be carefully
   coordinated among the sender and receivers or with looser
   coordination and interaction.  This leads to a number of different
   use cases for these protocols.

2.3.  Target Use Case Characteristics

   This section focuses on the target use cases and their special
   characteristics.  These specificities will impact both the choice of
   the technological building blocks and the way they can be applied.
   One can distinguish the following use case features:

   o  Purely unidirectional transport versus symmetric bidirectional
      transport versus asymmetric bidirectional transport.  Most of the
      time, the amount of traffic flowing to the source is limited, and
      one can overlook whether the transport channel is symmetric or
      not.  The nature of the underlying transport channel is of
      paramount importance, since many security building blocks will
      require a bidirectional communication;

   o  Massively scalable versus moderately scalable session.  Here we do
      not define precisely what the terms "massively scalable" and



Adamson & Roca           Expires August 28, 2008                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


      "moderately scalable" mean.

   o  Known set of receivers versus unknown set of receivers: does the
      source know at any point of time the set of receivers or not?  Of
      course, knowing the set of receivers is usually not compatible
      with massively scalable sessions;

   o  Dynamic set of receivers versus fixed set of receivers: does the
      source know at some point of time the maximum set of receivers or
      will it evolve dynamically?  In case of a dynamic set of
      receivers, the source might desire to provide

   o  High rate data flow versus small rate data flow: some security
      building blocks are CPU intensive and are therefore incompatible
      with high data rate sessions (e.g. this is the case of solutions
      that digitally sign all the packets sent).

   o  Protocol stack available at both ends: a solution that requires
      some non-usual features within the protocol stack will not always
      be usable.  Some target environments (e.g. embedded systems) only
      provide a minimum set of features and extending them (e.g. to add
      IPsec) is not necessarily realistic;

   o  Multicast routing and other layer-3 protocols in use: for
      instance, SSM routing is often seen as one of the key service to
      improve the security within multicast sessions, and some security
      building blocks require specialized versions of layer-3 protocols
      (e.g.  IGMP/MLD with security extensions).  Depending on the
      target use case, these assumptions might or not be realistic

   Depending on the target goal and the associated security building
   block used, other features, related to the use case, might be of
   importance.  For instance TESLA requires a loose time synchronization
   between the source and the receivers.  Several possibilities exist to
   that purpose, some of them being only feasible if the target use case
   provides the appropriate features.


3.  Known Security Threats

   The IP architecture provides common access to notional control and
   data planes to both end and intermediate systems.  For the purposes
   of discussion here, the "control plane" mechanisms are considered
   those with message exchanges between end systems (typically
   computers) and intermediate systems (typically routers) and while the
   "data plane" encompasses messages exchanged among end systems,
   usually pertaining to the transfer of application data.  The security
   threats described here are introduced within the taxonomy of control

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


   plane and data plane IP mechanisms.

3.1.  Control-Plane Attacks

   While control-plane attacks may be considered outside of the scope of
   the transport protocol specfications discussed here, it is important
   to understand the potential impact of such attacks with respect to
   the deployment and operation of these protocols.  For example,
   awareness of possible IP Multicast control-plane manipulation that
   can lead to unauthorized (or unexpected) monitoring of data plane
   traffic by malicious users may lead a transport application or
   protocol implementation to support encryption to ensure data
   confidentiality and/or privacy.  Also, these types of attack also
   have bearing on assessing the real risks of potentially more complex
   attacks against the transport mechanisms themselves.  In some cases,
   the solutions to these control-plane risk areas may reduce the impact
   or possibility of some data-plane attacks that are discussed in this
   document.

3.1.1.  Control Plane Monitoring

   While this may not be a direct attack on the transport system, it may
   be possible for an attacker to gain useful information in advancing
   attack goals by monitoring IP Multicast control plane traffic
   including group membership and multicast routing information.
   Indentification of hosts and/or routers participating in specific
   multicast groups may readily identify systems vulnerable to protocol-
   specific exploitation.  And, with regards to user privacy concerns,
   such "side information" may be relevant to this emerging aspect of
   network security.

3.1.2.  Unauthorized (or Malicious) Group Membership

   One of the simplest attacks is that where a malicious host joins an
   IP multicast group so that potentially unwanted traffic is routed to
   the host's network interface.  This type of attack can turn a
   legitimate source of IP traffic into a "attacker" without requiring
   any access privileges to the source host or routers involved.  This
   type of attack can be used for denial-of-service purposes or for the
   real attacker (the malicious joiner) to gain access to the
   information content being sent.  Similarly, some routing protocols
   may permit any sender (whether joined to the specific group or not)
   to transmit messages to a multicast group.

   It is possible that malicious hosts could also spoof IGMP messages,
   joining groups posing as legitimate hosts (or spoof source traffic
   from legitimate hosts).  This may be done at intermediate locations
   in the network or by hosts co-resident with the authorized hosts on



Adamson & Roca           Expires August 28, 2008                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


   local area networks.  Such spoofing could be done by raw packet
   generation or with replay of previously-recorded control messages.
   For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that multicast
   routing protocol control messaging may be subject to similar threats
   if insufficient protocol security mechanisms are enabled in the
   routing infrastructure.

   The presence of these types of attack may necessitate that policy-
   based controls be emplaced in routers to limit the distribution
   (including transmission and reception) of multicast traffic (on a
   group-wise and/or traffic volume basis) to different parts of the
   network.  Such policy-based controls are beyond the scope of the RMT
   protocol specifications.  However, such network protection mechanisms
   may reduce the opportunities for or effectiveness of of some of the
   data-plane attacks discussed later.  For example, reverse-path checks
   can significantly limit opportunities for attackers to conduct replay
   attacks when hosts actually do use IPSec.  Also, future IP Multicast
   control protocols may wish to consider providing security mechanism
   to prevent unauthorized monitoring or manipulation of messages
   related to group membership, routing, and activity.

3.2.  Data-Plane Attacks

   This section discusses some types of active attacks that might be
   conducted "in-band" with respect to the reliable multicast transport
   protocol operating within the data plane of network data transfer.
   The passive attack of unauthorized data-plan monitoring is discussed
   above since such activity might be made possible by the
   vulnerabilities of the IP Multicast control plane.  To cover the two
   classes of RMT protocols, the active data-plane attacks are
   categorized as 1) those where the attacker generates messages posing
   as a data sender, and 2) those where the attacker generates messages
   posing as a receiver providing feedback to the sender(s) or group.
   Additionally, a common threat to protocol operation is that of brute-
   force, rogue packet generation.  This is discussed briefly below, but
   the more subtle attacks that might be conducted are given more
   attention as those fall within the scope of the RMT transport
   protocol design.  Additionally, special consideration is given to
   that of the "replay attack" [see Section 3.2.4], as it can be applied
   across these different categories.

3.2.1.  Rogue Traffic Generation

   If an attacker is able to successfully inject packets into the
   multicast distribution tree, one obvious denial-of-service attack is
   for the attacker to generate a large volume of apparently
   authenticate (and when authentication mechanisms are used, a "replay"
   attack strategy might be used) traffic.  The impact of this type of



Adamson & Roca           Expires August 28, 2008                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


   attack can be significant since the potential for routers to relay
   the traffic to multiple portions of a networks (as compared to a
   single unicast routing path).  However, other than the amplified
   negative impact to the network, this type of attack is no different
   than what is possible with rogue unicast packet generation and
   similar measures used to protect the network from such attacks could
   be used to contain this type of brute-force attack.  Of course, the
   pragmatic question of whether current implementations of such
   protection mechanisms support IP Multicast SHOULD be considered.

3.2.2.  Sender Message Spoofing

   These types of attacks are applicable to both general types of RMT
   protocols: ALC (sender-only transmission) and NORM (sender-receiver
   exhanges).  Without an authentication mechanism, an attacker can
   easily generate sender messages that could disrupt a reliable
   multicast transfer session.  And with FEC-based transport mechanisms,
   a single packet with an apparently-correct FEC payload identifier
   [RFC3452] but a corrupted FEC payload could potentially render an
   entire block of transported data invalid.  Thus, a modest injection
   rate of corrupt traffic could cause severe impairment of data
   transport.  Additionallly, such invalid sender packets could convey
   out-of-bound indices (e.g. bad symbol or block identifiers) that can
   lead to buffer overflow exploits or similar issues in implementations
   that insufficient check for invalid data.

   An indirect use of sender message spoofing would be to generate
   messages that would cause receivers to take inappropriate congestion-
   control action.  In the case of the layered congestion control
   mechanisms proposed for ALC use, this could lead to the receivers
   erroneusly leaving groups associated with higher bandwidth transport
   layers and suffering unnecessarily low transport rates.  Similarly,
   receivers may be misled to join inappropriate groups directing
   unwanted traffic to their part of the network.  Attacks with similar
   effect could be conducted against the TFMCC approach proposed for
   NORM operation with spoofing of sender messages carrying congestion
   control state to receivers.

3.2.3.  Receiver Message Spoofing

   These atacks are limited to RMT protocols that use feedback from
   receivers in the group to influence sender and other receiver
   operation.  In the NORM protocol, this includes negative-
   acknowledgement (NACK) messages fed back to the sender to achieve
   reliable transfer, congestion control feedback content, and the
   optional positive acknowledgement features of the specification.  It
   is also important to note that for ASM operation, NORM receivers pay
   attention to the messages of other receivers for the purpose of



Adamson & Roca           Expires August 28, 2008               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


   suppression to avoid feedback implosion as group size grows large.

   An attacker that can generate false feedback can manipulate the NORM
   sender to unnecessarily transmit repair information and reduce the
   goodput of the reliable transfer regardless of the sender's transmit
   rate.  Contrived congestion control feedback could also cause the
   sender to transmit at an unfairly low rate.

   As mentioned, spoofed receiver messaging may not be directed only at
   senders, but also at receivers participating in the session.  For
   example, an attacker may direct phony receiver feedback messages to
   selected receivers in the group causing those receivers to suppress
   feedback that might have otherwise been transmitted.  This attack
   could compromise the ability of those receivers to achieve reliable
   transfer.  Also, suppressed congestion control feedback could cause
   the sender to perhaps transmit at a rate unfair to those attacked
   receivers if their fair congestion control rate were lower than other
   receivers in the group.

3.2.4.  Replay Attacks

   The infamous "replay attack" (injection of a previously transmitted
   packet (or at least its payload) into the reliable transport group or
   directly to one or more of its participants) is given special
   attention here because of the special consequences it can have on RMT
   protocol operation.  Without specific protection mechanisms against
   replay (e.g. duplicate message detection), it is possible for these
   attacks to be successful even when security mechanisms such as packet
   authentication and/or encryption are employed.

3.2.4.1.  Replay of Sender Messages

   Generally, replay of recent protocol messages from the sender will
   not harm transport, and could potentially assist it, unless it is of
   sufficient volume to result in the same type of impact as the "rogue
   traffic generation" described above.  However, it is possible that
   replay of sufficiently old messages may cause receivers to think they
   are "out of sync" with the sender and reset state, compromising the
   transfer.  Also, if sender transport data identifiers are reused
   (object identifiers, FEC payload identifiers, etc), it is possible
   that replay of old messages could corrupt data of a current transfer.

3.2.4.2.  Replay of Receiver Messages

   Replay of receiver messages are problematic for the NORM protocol,
   because replay of NACK messages could cause the sender unnecessarily
   transmit repair information for an FEC coding block.  Similarly, the
   sender transmission rate might be manipulated by replay of congestion



Adamson & Roca           Expires August 28, 2008               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


   control feedback messages from receivers in the group.  And the way
   that NORM senders estimate group round-trip timing (GRTT) could allow
   a replay attack to manipulate the senders' GRTT estimate to an
   unnecessarily large value, adding latency to the reliable transport
   process.


4.  General Security Goals

   The term "security" is extremely vast and encompasses many different
   meanings.  The goal of this section is to clarify what "security"
   means when considering the reliable multicast transport (RMT)
   protocols being defined in the IETF RMT working group.  The scope can
   also encompass additional group communication applications, for
   instance streaming applications.  This section only focuses on the
   desired general goals.  The following sections will then discuss the
   possible elementary services that will be required to fulfill these
   general goals, as well as the underlying technological building
   blocks.

   The possible final goals include, in decreasing order of importance:

   o  network protection: the goal is to protect the network from
      attacks, no matter whether these attacks are voluntary (i.e.
      launched by one or several attackers) or non voluntary (i.e.
      caused by a misbehaving system, where "system" can designate a
      building block, a protocol, an application, or a user);

   o  protocol protection: the goal is to protect the RMT protocol
      itself, e.g. to avoid that a misbehaving receiver prevents other
      receivers to get the content, no matter whether this is done
      intentionally or not;

   o  and content protection: to goal is to protect the content itself,
      for instance to guaranty the integrity of the content, or to make
      sure that only authorized clients can access the content.

4.1.  Network Protection

   Protecting the network is of course of primary importance.  An
   attacker should not be able to damage the whole infrastructure by
   exploiting some features of the RMT protocol.  Unfortunately, recent
   past has shown that the multicast routing infrastructure is
   relatively fragile, as well as the applications built on top of it.
   Since the RMT protocols may use congestion control mechanisms to
   regulate sender transmission rate, the protocol security features
   should ensure that the sender may not be manipulated to transmit at
   incorrect rates (most importantly not at an excessive rate) to any



Adamson & Roca           Expires August 28, 2008               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


   parts of the the receiver group.  In the case of NORM, the security
   mechanisms should ensure that the feedback suppression mechanisms are
   protected to prevent badly-behaving network nodes from purposefully
   causing feedback implosion.  In the case of ALC, where layered
   congestion control may be used via dynamic grou/layer membership,
   this extends to considerations of excessive manipulation of the
   multicast router control plane.

4.2.  Protocol Protection

   Protecting the protocols is also importance, since the higher the
   number of clients, the more serious the consequences of an attack.
   This is all the more true as scalability is often one of the desired
   goals of RMT protocols.  Ideally, receivers should be sufficiently
   isolated from one another, so that a single misbehaving receiver does
   not affect others.  Similarly, an external attacker should not be
   able to break the system, i.e. resulting in unreliable operation or
   delivery of incorrect content.

4.3.  Content Protection

   Finally, the content itself should be protected when meaningful.
   This level of security is often the concern of the content provider
   (and its responsibility).  For instance, in case of confidential (or
   non-free) content, the typical solution consists in encrypting the
   content.  It can be done within the upper application, i.e. above the
   RMT protocol, or within the transport system.

   But other requirements may exist, like verifying the integrity of a
   received object, or authenticating the sender of the received
   packets.  To that goal, one can rely on the use of building blocks
   integrated within, or above, or beneath the RMT protocol.

   One may also consider that offering the packet sender authentication
   and content integrity services are basic requirements that should
   fulfill any RMT system that operates within an open network, where
   any attacker can easily inject spurious traffic in an ongoing NORM or
   ALC session.  In that case this goal is not the responsibility of the
   content provider but the responsibility of the administrator who
   deploys the RMT system itself.


5.  Elementary Security Services

   The goals defined in Section 4 will be fulfilled by means of
   underlying elementary services, provided by one or several
   technological building blocks.  This section only focuses on these
   elementary services.



Adamson & Roca           Expires August 28, 2008               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


   The services traditionally listed are:

   o  packet source authentication and integrity: the goal is to enable
      a receiver to verify the source of a packet and that the packet
      has not been modified in transit;

   o  packet group authentication and integrity: the goal is to enable a
      receiver to verify that a packet originated within the group and
      has not been modified by nonmembers in transit;

   o  packet non-repudiation: the goal is to enable any third party to
      verify the source of a packet.  In that case the source cannot
      repudiate having sent the packet;

   o  packet anti-replay: the goal is to enable a receiver to detect
      that a given packet has already been received;

   o  object sender and object integrity: the goal is to enable a
      receiver to verify the identity of the sender of the object and
      the integrity of the whole object;

   o  object confidentiality: the goal is to enable a source to guaranty
      that only authorized receivers can access the object dat

   To this list, one must add the services specific to the RMT
   protocols:

   o  congestion control security: the goal is to prevent an attacker
      from modifying the congestion control protocol normal behavior
      (e.g. by reducing the transmission (NORM) or reception (ALC) rate,
      or on the opposite increasing this rate up to a point where
      congestion occurs);

   o  group management: the goal is to make sure that only authorized
      receivers (as defined by a certain group management policy), join
      the RMT session and possibly inform the source;

   o  backward group secrecy: the goal is to prevent a new group member
      to access the information in clear sent to the group before he
      joined the group;

   o  forward group secrecy: the goal is to prevent a former group
      member to access the information in clear sent to the group after
      he left the group;

   These services are usually achieved by means of one or several
   technological building blocks.  The target use case where the RMT
   system will be deployed will greatly impact the choice of the

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


   technological building block(s) used to provide these services, as
   explained in Section 2.3.


6.  Technological Building Blocks

   Here is a list of techniques and building blocks that are likely to
   fulfill one or several of the goals listed above:

   o  IPsec;

   o  Use of TESLA within RMT;

   o  Use of Group MAC within RMT;

   o  Use of Digital signatures within RMT;

   o  use of SSM (Source Specific Multicast) multicast routing;

   o  Digital Signature;

   o  (TBD) add other BBs

   Each of them is now quickly discussed.  In particular we identify
   what service it can offer, its limitations, and its field of
   application (adequacy W.R.T. the CDP and the target use case).

6.1.  IPsec

6.1.1.  Benefits

   One direct approach using existing standards is to apply IPSec
   [RFC2401] to achieve the following properties for message
   transmission:

   1.  Authentication (IPSec AH or ESP)

   2.  Confidentiality (IPSec ESP)

6.1.2.  Requirements

   It is expected that the approach to apply IPSec for reliable
   multicast transport sessions is similar to that described for OSPFv3
   security[RFC4552].  The following list proposes the IPSec
   capabilities needed to support a similar approach to RMT protocol
   security:





Adamson & Roca           Expires August 28, 2008               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


   1.  Mode - Transport mode IPSec security is required;

   2.  Selectors - source and destination addresses and ports, protocol.

   3.  For some uses, preplaced manual key support may be required to
       support application deployment and operation.  For automated key
       management for group communication the Group Secure Association
       Key Management Protocol (GSAKMP) described in [RFC4535] may be
       used to emplace the keys for IPSec operation.

   Note that a periodic rekeying procedure similar to that described in
   RFC 4552 can also be applied with the additional benefit that the
   reliable transport aspects of the RMT protocols provide robustness to
   any message loss that might occur due to ANY timing discrepencies
   among the participants in the reliable multicast session.

6.1.3.  Limitations

   It should be noted that current IPSec implementations may not provide
   the capability for anti-replay protection for multicast operation.
   In the case of the NORM protocol, a sequence number is provided for
   packet loss measurement to support congestion control operation.
   This sequence number can also be used within a NORM implementation
   for detecting duplicate (replayed) messages from sources (senders or
   receivers) within the transport session group.  In this way,
   protection against replay attack can be achieved in conjunction with
   the authentication and possibly confidentiality properties provided
   by an IPSec encapsulation of NORM messages.  NORM receivers generate
   a very low volume of feedback traffic and it is expected that the 16-
   bit sequence space provided by NORM will be sufficient for replay
   attack protection.  When a NORM session is long-lived, the limits of
   the sender repair window are expected to provide protection from
   replayed NACKs as they would typically be outside of the sender's
   current repair window.  It is suggested that IPSec implementations
   that can provide anti-replay protection for IP Multicast traffic,
   even when there are multiple senders within a group, be adopted.  The
   GSAKMP document has some discussion in this area.

6.2.  Use of TESLA within RMT

6.2.1.  Benefits

   The use of TESLA [TESLA_4_ALC_NORM] within the RMT protocols offers a
   loss tolerant, lightweight, authentication/integrity service for the
   packets generated by the session's sender.  Depending on the time
   synchronization method and bootstrap method used, TESLA is compatible
   with massively scalable sessions.  Because TESLA eavily relies on
   fast symmetric cryptographic building blocks, CPU processing remains



Adamson & Roca           Expires August 28, 2008               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


   limited both at the sender and receiver sides, which makes it
   suitable for high data rate transmissions, and/or lightweight
   terminals.  Finally, the transmission overhead remains limited.

6.2.2.  Requirements

   The security offered by TESLA relies heavily on time.  Therefore the
   session's sender and each receiver need to be loosely synchronized in
   a secure way.  To that purpose, several methods exist, depending on
   the use case: direct time synchronization (which requires a
   bidirectional transport channel), using a secure NTP infrastructure
   (which also requires a bidirectional transport channel), or a GPS
   device, or a clock with a time-drift that is negligible in front of
   the TESLA time accuracy requirements.

   The various bootstrap parameters must also be communicated to the
   receivers, using either an in-band or out-of-band mechanism,
   sometimes requiring bidirectional communications.

   So, depending on the time synchronization scheme and the bootstrap
   mechanism method, TESLA can be used with either bidirectional or
   unidirectional transport channels.

6.2.3.  Limitations

   A first limitation is that TESLA does not protect the packets that
   are generated by receivers, for instance the feedback packets of
   NORM.  These packets must be protected by other means.

   Another limitation is that TESLA requires some buffering capabilities
   at the receivers in order to enable the delayed authentication
   feature.  This is not considered though as a major issue in the
   general case (e.g.  FEC decoding of objects within an ALC session
   already requires some buffering capabilities, that often exceed that
   of TESLA), but it might be one in case of embedded environments.

6.3.  Use of Group MAC within CDP

6.3.1.  Benefits

   The use of Group MAC (Message Authentication Codes) within the CDP
   [SIMPLE_AUTH_4_ALC_NORM] is a simple solution to provide a loss
   tolerant group authentication/integrity service for all the packets
   exchanged within a session (i.e. the packets generated by the
   session's sender and the session's receivers).  This scheme is easy
   to deploy since it only requires that all the group members share a
   common secret key.  Because Group MAC heavily relies on fast
   symmetric cryptographic building blocks, CPU processing remains



Adamson & Roca           Expires August 28, 2008               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


   limited both at the sender and receiver sides, which makes it
   suitable for high data rate transmissions, and/or lightweight
   terminals.  Finally, the transmission overhead remains limited.

6.3.2.  Requirements

   This scheme only requires that all the group members share a common
   secret key, possibly associated to a re-keying mechanism (e.g. each
   time the group membership changes, or on a periodic basis).

6.3.3.  Limitations

   This scheme cannot protect against attacks coming from inside the
   group, where a group member impersonates the sender and sends forged
   messages to other receivers.  It only provides a group-level
   authentication/integrity service, unlike the TESLA and Digital
   Signature schemes.

   Note that the Group MAC and Digital Signature schemes can be
   advantageously used together, as explained in
   [SIMPLE_AUTH_4_ALC_NORM].

6.4.  Use of Digital Signatures within CDP

6.4.1.  Benefits

   The use of Digital Signatures within the CDP [SIMPLE_AUTH_4_ALC_NORM]
   is a simple solution to provide a loss tolerant authentication/
   integrity service for all the packets exchanged within a session
   (i.e. the packets generated by the session's sender and the session's
   receivers).  This scheme is easy to deploy since it only requires
   that the participants know the packet sender's public key, which can
   be achieved with either Public Key Infrastructre (PKI) or by pre-
   deploying these keys.

6.4.2.  Requirements

   This scheme is easy to deploy since it only requires that the
   participants know the packet sender's public key, which can be
   achieved either thanks to a PKI or by pre-deploying these keys.

6.4.3.  Limitations

   When RSA asymmetric cryptography is used, digital signatures has two
   major shortcommings:

   o  it is limited by high computational costs, especially at the
      sender, and



Adamson & Roca           Expires August 28, 2008               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


   o  it is limited by high transmission overheads.

   This scheme is well suited to low data rate flows, when transmission
   overheads are not a major issue.  For instance it can be used as a
   complement to TESLA for the feedback traffic coming from the
   session's receivers.

   The use of ECC ("Eliptic Curve Cryptography") significantly relaxes
   these constraints, especially when seeking for higher security
   levels.  For instance, the following key size provide equivalent
   security:

           +--------------------+--------------+--------------+
           | Symmetric Key Size | RSA Key Size | ECC Key Size |
           +--------------------+--------------+--------------+
           |       80 bits      |   1024 bits  |   160 bits   |
           |      112 bits      |   2048 bits  |   224 bits   |
           +--------------------+--------------+--------------+

   However ECC is heavily patented, notably by the Certicom Inc.
   company.

   Note that the Group MAC and Digital Signature schemes can be
   advantageously used together, as explained in
   [SIMPLE_AUTH_4_ALC_NORM].

6.5.  SSM Multicast Routing

   Source-specific Multicast (SSM) [RFC3569] amends the classical Any-
   source Multicast (ASM) model creating logical IP multicast "channels"
   that are defined by the multicast destination address _and_ the
   specific source address.  Thus for a given "channel", only one
   specific source can inject packets that are distributed to receivers
   that have joined.  This form of multicast has group management
   benefits since a source can independently control the "channels" it
   creates.  Additionally, there are some security benefits of this
   multicast paradigm.

6.5.1.  Benefits

   Since data-plane traffic for an SSM "channel" is limited to that of a
   single, specific source address, it is possible that network
   intermediate systems may impose mechanims that prevent injection of
   traffic to the group from inappropriate (perhaps malicious) nodes.
   This can reduce the risk for denial-of-service and some of the other
   attacks described in this document.  While SSM alone is not a
   complete security solution, it can simplify secure RMT operation.

Internet-Draft         Security and RMT Protocols          February 2008


6.5.2.  Requirements

   Use of SSM requires that the network intermediate systems explicitly
   support it.  Additionally, hosts are required to support the IGMPv3
   extensions for SSM and applications and RMT implementations will need
   to support use of IGMPv3 including management of the <sourceAddr:
   dstMcastAdd> "channel" identifier.

6.5.3.  Limitations

   RMT protocols such as NORM that use signaling from receivers to
   multicast senders will need to use unicast addressing for feedback
   messages.  In the case of NORM, its timer-based feedback suppression
   requires support of the sender NORM_CMD(REPAIR_ADV) message to
   control receiver feedback.  In some topologies, use of unicast
   feedback may require some additional latency (increased backoff
   factor) for safe operation.  The security of the unicast feedback
   from the receivers to sender will need to be addressed separately
   since the IP multicast model, including SSM, does not provide the
   sender knowledge of authorized group members.

6.6.  Summary

   The following table summarizes the pros/cons of each authentication/
   integrity scheme used at application/transport level:

   +----------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+-------+

7.  Global Security Infrastructure

   Deploying the elementary technological building blocks often requires
   that a global security infrastructure exists.  This security
   infrastructure:

   o  can provide a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure): this PKI provides
      for trusted third party vetting of, and vouching for, user
      identities.  It also allows the binding of public keys to users,
      usually by means of certificates.

   o  can provide a group key management service: this service usually
      provides rekeying schemes, either periodic or triggered by some
      higher level event.  It is required in particular when the group
      is dynamic and forward/backward secrecy are important.  This is
      also required to improve the scalability of the CDP (since key
      management is done automatically, using a key server topology), or
      the security provided by the CDP (since the underlying
      cryptographic keys will be changed frequently).

   o  (TBD): add more...

8.  New Threats Introduced by the Security Scheme Itself

   Introducing a security scheme, as a side effect, can sometimes
   introduce new security threats.  For instance, signing all packets
   with asymmetric cryptographic schemes (to provide a source
   authentication/content integrity/anti-replay service) opens the door
   to DoS attacks.  Indeed, verifying asymmetric-based cryptographic
   signatures is a CPU intensive task.  Therefore an attacker can easily
   overload a receiver (or a sender in case of NORM) by injecting a
   significant number of faked packets.To

9.  Consequences for the RMT and MSEC Working Group

   To meet the goals outlined in this document, it is expected that the
   RMT and Multicast Security (MSEC) WG may need to develop some
   supporting protocol security mechanisms.

9.1.  RMT Transport Message Security Encapsulation Header

   An alternative approach to using IPSec to provide the necessary
   properties to protect RMT protocol operation from the application
   attacks described earlier, is to extend the RMT protocol message set
   to include a message encapsulation option.  This encapsulation header
   could be used to provide authentication, confidientiality, and anti-
   replay protection as needed.  Since this would be independent of the
   IP layer, the header might need to provide a source identifier to be
   used as a "selector" for recalling security state (including
   authentication certificate(s), sequence state, etc) for a given
   message.  In the case of the NORM protocol, a NormNodeId field exists
   that could be used for this purpose.  In the case of ALC, the
   security encapsulation mechanism would need to add this function.
   The security encapsulation mechanism, although resident "above" the
   IP layer, could use GSAKMP [RFC4535] or a similar approach for
   automated key managment.


10.  Security Considerations

   This document is a general discussion of security for the RMT
   protocol family.  But specific security considerations are not
   applicable as this document does not introduce any new techniques.


11.  Acknowledgments

   The authors would like acknowledge Magnus Westerlund for stimulating
   the working group activity in this area.  Additionally George Gross
   and Ran Atkinson contributed ideas to the discussion here.
