Abstract

   The specification for enhanced mail system enhanced status codes, RFC
   3463, establishes a new code model and lists a collection of status
   codes.  While it anticipated that more codes would be added over
   time, it did not provide an explicit mechanism for registering and
   tracking those codes.  This document specifies an IANA registry for
   mail system enhanced status codes, and initializes that registry with

   the codes so far established in published standards-track documents,
   as well as other codes that have become established in the industry.

Internet-Draft     SMTP Enhanced Status Code Registry      February 2008


1.  Introduction

   Enhanced Status Codes for SMTP were first defined in [RFC1893],
   subsequently replaced by [RFC3463].  While it anticipated that more
   codes would be added over time (see its Section 2), it did not
   provide an explicit mechanism for registering and tracking those
   codes.  Since that time, various RFCs have been published and
   internet drafts proposed that define further status codes.  However,
   without an IANA registry, conflicts in definitions have begun to
   appear.

   This RFC defines such an IANA registry and was written to help
   prevent further conflicts from appearing in the future.  It
   initializes the registry with the established standards-track
   enhanced status codes from [RFC3463], [RFC3886], [RFC4468] and
   [RFC4954].  In addition, several codes are added that were
   established by various internet drafts and have come into common use,
   despite the expiration of the documents themselves.

   NOTE: The values given in Table 1 below are incomplete.  The entries
   denoted "Not given" should be filled in better.  (RFC EDITOR NOTE:
   Remove this paragraph on publication.)

   This document is being discussed on the SMTP mailing list,
   ietf-smtp@imc.org.  (RFC EDITOR NOTE: Remove this paragraph on
   publication.)


2.  IANA Considerations

2.1.  SMTP Enhanced Status Codes Registry

   IANA is directed to create the registry "SMTP Enhanced Status Codes".
   The Mail Enhanced Status Codes registry will have three tables:

   o  class sub-code,
   o  subject sub-code, and
   o  enumerated status codes, which have an unspecified class sub-code,
      a specified subject sub-code, and a specified detail sub-code.

   Each entry in the tables will include the following.  (The sub-code
   tables will not have the Associated Basic Status Code entries.)

   Code:                         The sub-code or enumerated status code,
                                 which will be a numeric code consisting
                                 of three components, as specified in
                                 [RFC3463].

   Summary: or Sample Text:      For class and subject sub-codes, this
                                 is the summary of the use for the sub-
                                 code shown in section 2 of [RFC3463].
                                 For enumerated status codes, this is an
                                 example of a message that might be sent
                                 along with the code.
   Associated Basic Status Code: For enumerated status codes, the basic
                                 status code(s) of [RFC2821] with which
                                 it is usually associated.  This may
                                 also have a value such as "Any" or "Not
                                 given".  NOTE: This is a non-exclusive
                                 list.
   Description:                  A short description of the code.
   Defined:                      A reference to the document in which
                                 the code is defined.  This reference
                                 should note whether the relevant
                                 specification is standards-track or not
                                 using "(Standards track)" or "(Not
                                 standards track)".
   Submitter:                    The identity of the submitter, usually
                                 the document author.
   Change Controller:            The identity of the change controller
                                 for the specification.  This will be
                                 "IESG" in the case of IETF-produced
                                 documents.

   An example of an entry in the enumerated status code table would be:

   Code:               X.0.0
   Sample Text:        Other undefined Status
   Associated basic status code:  Any
   Description:        Other undefined status is the only undefined
                       error code.  It should be used for all errors for
                       which only the class of the error is known.
   Defined:            RFC 3463.  (Standards track)
   Submitter:          G. Vaudreuil
   Change controller:  IESG.

2.2.  Review Process for New Values

   Entries in this registry are expected to follow the "Specification
   Required" model ([RFC2434]) although, in practice, most entries are
   expected to derive from standards-track documents.  Non-standards-
   track documents that specify codes to be registered should be readily
   available.  The principal purpose of this registry is to avoid
   confusion and conflicts among different definitions or uses for the
   same code.

Internet-Draft     SMTP Enhanced Status Code Registry      February 2008


   The procedures from [RFC4020] may be followed to pre-allocate an
   Enhanced Status Code before final publication of an internet draft.

2.3.  Registration Updates

   Standards-track registrations may be updated if the relevant
   standards are updated as a consequence of that action.  Non-
   standards-track entries may be updated by the listed responsible
   party.  Only the entry's short description or references may be
   modified in this way, not the code or associated text.  In
   exceptional cases, any aspect of any registered entity may be updated
   at the direction of the IESG (for example, to correct a conflict).

2.4.  Initial Values

   The initial values for the class and subject sub-code tables are to
   be populated from section 2 of [RFC3463].  Specifically, these are
   the values for 2.X.XXX, 4.X.XXX and 5.X.XXX for the class sub-code
   table, and the values X.0.XXX, X.1.XXX, X.2.XXX, X.3.XXX, X.4.XXX,
   X.5.XXX, X.6.XXX and X.7.XXX for the subject sub-code table.  The
   code, sample text and description for each entry are to be taken from
   [RFC3463].  Each entry is to be designated as defined in [RFC3463],
   submitted by G. Vaudreuil, and change controlled by IESG.  There are
   no associated basic status code values for the class and subject sub-
   code tables.

   The initial values for the enumerated status code table is to be
   populated from:

   1.  sections 3.1 through 3.8 of [RFC3463], (X.0.0, X.1.0 through
       X.1.8, X.2.0 through X.2.4, X.3.0 through X.3.5, X.4.0 through
       X.4.7, X.5.0 through X.5.5, X.6.0 through X.6.5, and X.7.0
       through X.7.7)
   2.  section 3.3.4 of [RFC3886] (X.1.9),
   3.  X.6.6 found in section 5 of [RFC4468],
   4.  and X.5.6, X.7.8, X.7.9, X.7.11 and X.7.12, found in section 6 of
       [RFC4954].

   Each entry is to be designated as defined in the corresponding RFC,
   submitted by the corresponding RFC author, and change controlled by
   the IESG.  Each of the above RFCs is a standards track document.

   The initial values for the Associated Basic Status Code for each of
   the above initial enhanced status codes is given in the following
   table.

   NOTE: This table is incomplete.  The entries denoted "Not given"
   should be filled in better.  (RFC EDITOR NOTE: Remove this note on

   enumerated status code table.  These entries have been used in the
   industry without any published specification.  (RFC EDITOR NOTE:
   change XXXX below to this document's RFC number.)

   Code:               X.7.10
   Sample Text:        Encryption Needed
   Associated basic status code:  523
   Description:        This indicates that external strong privacy layer
                       is needed in order to use the requested
                       authentication mechanism.  This is primarily
                       intended for use with clear text authentication
                       mechanisms.  A client which receives this may
                       activate a security layer such as TLS prior to
                       authenticating, or attempt to use a stronger
                       mechanism.
   Defined:            RFC XXXX.  (Standards track)
   Submitter:          T. Hansen, J. Klensin
   Change controller:  IESG.

   Code:               X.7.13
   Sample Text:        User Account Disabled
   Associated basic status code:  525
   Description:        Sometimes a system administrator will have to
                       disable a user's account (e.g., due to lack of
                       payment, abuse, evidence of a break-in attempt,
                       etc).  This error code occurs after a successful
                       authentication to a disabled account.  This

                       informs the client that the failure is permanent
                       until the user contacts their system
                       administrator to get the account re-enabled.  It
                       differs from a generic authentication failure
                       where the client's best option is to present the
                       passphrase entry dialog in case the user simply
                       mistyped their passphrase.
   Defined:            RFC XXXX.  (Standards track)
   Submitter:          T. Hansen, J. Klensin
   Change controller:  IESG.

   Code:               X.7.14
   Sample Text:        Trust relationship required
   Associated basic status code:  535, 554
   Description:        The submission server requires a configured trust
                       relationship with a third-party server in order
                       to access the message content.  This value
                       replaces the prior use of X.7.8 for this error
                       condition. thereby updating [RFC4468].

3.  Security Considerations

   As stated in [RFC1893], use of enhanced status codes may disclose
   additional information about how an internal mail system is
   implemented beyond that available through the SMTP status codes.

   Many proposed additions to the response code list are security
   related.  Having these registered in one place to prevent collisions
   will improve their value.  Security error responses can leak
   information to active attackers (e.g., the distinction between "user
   not found" and "bad password" during authentication).  Documents
   defining security error codes should make it clear when this is the
   case so SMTP server software subject to such threats can provide
   appropriate controls to restrict exposure.


4.  Acknowledgements

   While the need for this registry should have become clear shortly
   after [RFC3463] was approved, the growth of the code table through
   additional documents and work done as part of email
   internationalization and [RFC2821] updating efforts made the
   requirement much more clear.  The comments of the participants in
   those efforts are gratefully acknowledged, particularly the members
