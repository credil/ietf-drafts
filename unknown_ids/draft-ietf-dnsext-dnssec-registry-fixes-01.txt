  DNS Security (DNSSEC) DNSKEY IANA Registry Algorithm Status Addition
               draft-ietf-dnsext-dnssec-registry-fixes-01

Abstract

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) has an IANA registry to allocate
   cryptographic algorithm suites for use in generating digital
   signatures over DNS data.  Newly introduced cryptographic algorithms
   to DNSSEC mean implementors need to know which algorithms need to be
   implmented, which are optional, and which are obsolete.  This
   document adds a column to the IANA registry table for Domain Name
   System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers to list their status for
   use.

Internet-Draft              IANA-Registry-Fix              November 2009


1.  Introduction

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and
   [RFC4035] uses digital signatures over DNS data to provide source
   authentication and integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA
   registry to allocate codes for digital signature algorithms
   (consisting of a cryptographic algorithm and one-way hash function).
   Certain digital signature algorithms are considered MANDATORY to
   implement for interoperability while others are listed as OPTIONAL or
   OBSOLETE.

   The original list of algorithm status is found in [RFC4034].  Other
   DNSSEC documents have added new algorithms or changed the status of
   algorithms in the registry.  However, implementors must read through
   all the documents in order to discover which algorithms are mandatory
   to implement and which are optional or no longer used.

   This document requests a column to be added to the IANA registry for
   Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers.  This column
   will list the current status of each digital signature algorithm in
   the registry.

2.  DNS Security Algorithm Number Subregisitry Fixes

   The DNS Security Algorithm Number subregistry (part of the Domain
   Name System (DNS) Security Number registry) will be modified to
   include a new column.  This column will contain the current
   implementation status of the given algorithm.  This document does not
   make any changes to any other column in the registry table.

   There are additional fixes to entries that are described in sub-
   section 2.1.  The overall new registry table is in sub-section 2.2.
   The values for the status were obtained from [RFC4034] with updates
   for algorithms specified after the originial DNSSEC specification.

2.1.  Individual Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Number
      Registry Entry Fixes

   This document changes three entries in the Domain Name System
   Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Registry.  They are:

   The description for allocation number 4 is changed to "Reserved until
   2020".

   The description for allocation number 9 is changed to "Reserved until
   2020".

   The description for allocation number 11 is changed to "Reserved

   until 2020".

2.2.  Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Number Registry

   As of the current time, the DNS Security Algorithm Number subregistry
   would look like the following:

                                  Zone  Trans

 255     Reserved

   Newly allocated algorithms will need to state their intended status
   in their specification.  The only way to change the status of an
   existing registry entry is to update RFC 4034; The IANA registry
   entry can be updated at the same time as the update to RFC 4034 is
   published.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document consists entirely of DNS IANA Considerations and
   includes the following changes detailed in Section 2.1:

   The description of allocation 4 is changed from "Reserved for ECC" to
   "Reserved until 2020".

   The description of allocation 9 is changed from "Unassigned" to
   "Reserved until 2020".

   The description of allocation 11 is changed from "Unassigned" to
   "Reserved until 2020".

   The references to FIPS 180 and FIPS 186 have been updated (to FIPS
   180-3 and FIPS 186-3 respectively) to reflect the latest versions.
   These revisions are maintenance updates and the main content of the
   FIPS document have not changed.

   The new table is in Section 2.2.  The Domain Name System (DNS)
   Security Algorithm Number registry is available at http://
   www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/
   dns-sec-alg-numbers.xhtml.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document seeks to add a column to an existing IANA registry.  It
   is not meant to be a discussion on algorithm superiority.  No new
   security considerations are raised in this document.
