Abstract

    Most IMAP extensions are used by the client when it wants to and the
    server supports to. However, a few extensions require the server to
    know whether a client supports that extension.  The ENABLE extension
    allows an IMAP client to say which extensions it supports.

1.  Conventions Used in This Document

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

    Formal syntax is defined by [RFC4234] as modified by [RFC3501].

    Example lines prefaced by "C:" are sent by the client and ones
    prefaced by "S:" by the server. The five characters [...] means that
    something has been elided.


2.  Overview

    CONSTORE ([RFC4551]), ANNOTATE ([ANNOTATE]) and some extensions
    under consideration at the moment use various commands to enable
    server extensions. (CONDSTORE uses a SELECT or FETCH parameter, and
    ANNOTATE uses a side effect of FETCH.) This extension adds a
    command, ENABLE, which enables such extensions without causing any
    other effect.

    An IMAP server which supports ENABLE advertises this by including
    the word ENABLE in its capability list.

    Most IMAP extensions do not require the client to enable the
    extension in any way.


3.  The ENABLE Command

    Arguments: capability names

    Result:    OK: Relevant capabilities enabled
               BAD: No arguments, or syntax error in an argument

    The ENABLE command takes a list of capability names, and requests
    the server to enable the named extensions. Once enabled using
    ENABLE, each extension remains active until the IMAP connection is
    closed. For each argument, the server does the following:

    - If the argument is not an extension known to the server, the
      server MUST ignore the argument.

    - If the argument is an extension known to the server, and it is not
      specifically permitted to enable it using ENABLE, the server MUST
      respond with BAD. (Note that knowing about an extension doesn't
      necessarily imply supporting that extension.)

    - If the argument is an extension is supported by the server and
      which needs to be enabled, the server MUST enable the extension
      for the duration of the connection. At present this applies only
      to CONDSTORE.

    Clients MUST only include extensions that need to be enabled in the
    server. At the time this RFC is published CONDSTORE is the only such
    extension (ie. ENABLE CONDSTORE is an additional "Condstore enabling
    command" as defined in [RFC4551]). Future RFCs may add to this list.
    [Note to the RFC Editor: If the IMAP ANNOTATE document has been
    published already, ANNOTATE should be mentioned as well as
    CONDSTORE.]

    There are no limitations on pipelining ENABLE. For example, it is
    possible to send ENABLE and then immediately AUTHENTICATE.

    The server MUST NOT change the CAPABILITY list as a result of
    executing ENABLE.

    The ENABLE command is valid in all states.

    In this example, the client enables CONDSTORE:

         C: a1 ENABLE CONDSTORE
         S: a1 OK Conditional Store enabled

    In the next example, the client asks about the server capabilities,
    the server tells the client only what's usable prior to login, the
    client enables CONDSTORE and X-GOOD-IDEA, then it logs in.

         C: b1 CAPABILITY
         S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 AUTH=CRAM-MD5 AUTH=DIGEST-MD5 ID
            LITERAL+ ENABLE
         S: b1 OK foo
         C: b2 ENABLE CONDSTORE X-GOOD-IDEA
         S: b2 OK foo
         C: b3 LOGIN d e
         S: b3 OK foo
         C: b4 CAPABILITY
         S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 ID LITERAL+ CONDSTORE
         S: b4 OK foo

    After command b, the client does not know whether CONDSTORE and X-
    GOOD-IDEA are enabled. After command d, the client learns that the
    server supports CONDSTORE but not X-GOOD-IDEA, so it knows that
    CONDSTORE is enabled.

4.  Formal Syntax

    The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
    Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC4234]. [RFC3501] defines
    the non-terminals "capability" and "command-any".

    Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
    insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
    token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
    accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

        capability   =/ "ENABLE"

        command-any  =/ "ENABLE" 1*(SP capability)


5.  Security considerations

    The ENABLE command may be executed before authentication, so it can
    be used by malevolent clients. Servers should parse and implement it
    with particular care.

    It is possible to use ENABLE to find out whether a server implements
    certain IMAP extensions. For example, if a server does not advertise
    IDLE (see [RFC2177]) in unauthenticated mode, an unauthenticated
    client can send ENABLE IDLE and use the response to find out whether
    the server supports IDLE. This is believed to be harmless, since the
    relevant extensions are necessarily not available to the client.


6.  IANA considerations

    The IANA is requested to add ENABLE to the IMAP4 Capabilities
    Registry.  [TO BE REMOVED: This registration should take place at
    the following location:
    http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities]


7.  Acknowledgements

    The idea came from Randy Gellens. Alexey Melnikov thought it was a
    good idea. The so-called author of this document typed it down and
    added the open issues section.

Open Issues

    None any more.

    It would be nice to have some text explaining that well-designed
    extensions don't need ENABLE, and why, but my attempts at such text
    have not come out well.


Changes since -00

    - The IANA asked me to specify the IANA registry exactly

    - Say "clients should only use ENABLE when it's really necessary"

    - Better abstract

    - Wording.

    - Refer to RFCs by number, not by topic.

    - Boilerplate updates - IETF Trust and so on.


Changes since -01

    - Specify that ENABLE ID is BAD, not ignorable.

    - Explicitly allow maximum pipelining.

    - Security implications.


Changes since -02

    - Nits

    - Unique tags in examples

    - Note specifically that a server can reply BAD to ENABLE ID, even
      if it doesn't support ID. All it needs is to know that ID cannot
      be ENABLEd.
