    Reed-Solomon Forward Error Correction (FEC) Schemes for FECFRAME
                       draft-roca-fecframe-rs-02

Abstract

   This document describes two fully-specified FEC schemes for Reed-
   Solomon codes that can be used to protect media streams along the
   lines defined by the FECFRAME framework.  Reed-Solomon codes belong
   to the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes which means
   they offer optimal protection against packet erasures.  They are also
   systematic codes, which means that the source symbols are part of the
   encoding symbols.  The price to pay is a limit on the maximum source
   block size, on the maximum number of encoding symbols, and a
   computational complexity higher than that of sparse parity check
   based FEC codes.  However, this complexity remains compatible with
   software codecs.

   The first scheme is for Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^m), with m in
   {2..16}, a simple FEC encoding and arbitrary packet flows.  The
   second scheme is similar to the first scheme, with the exception that
   it is for a single sequenced flow.

Internet-Draft          Reed-Solomon FEC Schemes              March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes is a classic solution
   to improve the reliability of unicast, multicast and broadcast
   Content Delivery Protocols (CDP) and applications [RFC3453].  The
   [FECFRAME-FRAMEWORK] document describes a generic framework to use
   FEC schemes with media delivery applications, and for instance with
   real-time streaming media applications based on the RTP real-time
   protocol.  Similarly the [RFC5052] document describes a generic
   framework to use FEC schemes with with objects (e.g., files) delivery
   applications based on the ALC [RMT-PI-ALC] and NORM [RFC5740]
   reliable multicast transport protocols.

   More specifically, the [RFC5053] and [RFC5170] FEC schemes introduce
   erasure codes based on sparse parity check matrices for object
   delivery protocols like ALC and NORM.  These codes are efficient in
   terms of processing but not optimal in terms of erasure recovery
   capabilities when dealing with "small" objects.

   The Reed-Solomon FEC codes described in this document belong to the
   class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes that are optimal in
   terms of erasure recovery capability.  It means that a receiver can
   recover the k source symbols from any set of exactly k encoding
   symbols.  These codes are also systematic codes, which means that the
   k source symbols are part of the encoding symbols.  However they are
   limited in terms of maximum source block size and number of encoding
   symbols.  Since the real-time constraints of media delivery
   applications usually limit the maximum source block size, this is not
   considered to be a major issue in the context of the FEC Framework
   for many (but not necessarily all) use-cases.  Additionally, if the
   encoding/decoding complexity is higher with Reed-Solomon codes than
   it is with [RFC5053] or [RFC5170] codes, it remains reasonable for
   most use-cases, even in case of a software codec.

   Many applications dealing with reliable content transmission or
   content storage already rely on packet-based Reed-Solomon erasure
   recovery codes.  In particular, many of them use the Reed-Solomon
   codec of Luigi Rizzo [RS-codec] [Rizzo97].  The goal of the present
   document is to specify Reed-Solomon schemes that are compatible with
   this codec.

   More specifically, the [RFC5510] document introduced such Reed-
   Solomon codes and several associated FEC schemes that are compatible
   with the [RFC5052] framework.  The present document inherits from
   [RFC5510] the specification of the core Reed-Solomon codes based on
   Vandermonde matrices, and specifies FEC schemes that are compatible
   with the FECFRAME framework [FECFRAME-FRAMEWORK].  Therefore this
   document specifies only the information specific to the FECFRAME

   context and refers to [RFC5510] for the core specifications of the
   codes.

   To that purpose, the present document introduces:
   o  the Fully-Specified FEC Scheme with FEC Encoding ID XXX that
      specifies the use of Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^m), with m in
      {2..16}, with a simple FEC encoding for arbitrary packet flows;
   o  the Fully-Specified FEC Scheme with FEC Encoding ID XXX is similar
      to Scheme XXX except that it is for a single sequenced flow;

   With the simple FEC encoding, a set of Application Data Units (or
   ADUs) coming from one or several media delivery applications (e.g., a
   set of RTP packets), are grouped in a ADU block and FEC encoded as a
   whole.  With Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8), there is a strict
   limit over the number ADUs that can be protected together, since the
   number of encoded symbols, n, must be inferior or equal to 255.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions Notations and Abbreviations

3.1.  Definitions

   This document uses the following terms and definitions.  Some of them
   are FEC scheme specific and are in line with [RFC5052]:
   Source symbol:  unit of data used during the encoding process.
   Encoding symbol:  unit of data generated by the encoding process.
      With systematic codes, source symbols are part of the encoding
      symbols.
   Repair symbol:  encoding symbol that is not a source symbol.
   Code rate:  the k/n ratio, i.e., the ratio between the number of
      source symbols and the number of encoding symbols.  By definition,
      the code rate is such that: 0 < code rate <= 1.  A code rate close
      to 1 indicates that a small number of repair symbols have been
      produced during the encoding process.
   Systematic code:  FEC code in which the source symbols are part of
      the encoding symbols.  The Reed-Solomon codes introduced in this
      document are systematic.

   Source block:  a block of k source symbols that are considered
      together for the encoding.
   Packet Erasure Channel:  a communication path where packets are
      either dropped (e.g., by a congested router, or because the number
      of transmission errors exceeds the correction capabilities of the
      physical layer codes) or received.  When a packet is received, it
      is assumed that this packet is not corrupted.

   Some of them are FECFRAME framework specific and are in line with
   [FECFRAME-FRAMEWORK]:
   Application Data Unit (ADU):  a unit of data coming from (sender) or
      given to (receiver) the media delivery application.  Depending on
      the use-case, an ADU can use an RTP encapsulation.
   (Source) ADU Flow:  a flow of ADUs from a media delivery application
      and to which FEC protection is applied.  Depending on the use-
      case, several ADU flows can be protected together by the FECFRAME
      framework.
   ADU Block:  a set of ADUs that are considered together by the
      FECFRAME instance for the purpose of the FEC scheme.  Along with
      the F[], L[], and Pad[] fields, they form the set of source
      symbols over which FEC encoding will be performed.
   ADU Information (ADUI):  a unit of data constituted by the ADU and
      the associated Flow ID, Length and Padding fields (Section 4.2).
      This is the unit of data that is used to define source symbols.
   FEC Framework Configuration Information:  the FEC scheme specific
      information that enables the synchronization of the FECFRAME
      sender and receiver instances.
   FEC Source Packet:  a data packet submitted to (sender) or received
      from (receiver) the transport protocol.  It contains an ADU along
      with its optional Explicit Source FEC Payload ID.
   FEC Repair Packet:  a repair packet submitted to (sender) or received
      from (receiver) the transport protocol.  It contains a repair
      symbol along with its Explicit Repair FEC Payload ID.

   The above terminology is illustrated in Figure 1 (sender point of
   view):

3.2.  Notations

   This document uses the following notations: Some of them are FEC
   scheme specific:
   k      denotes the number of source symbols in a source block.
   max_k  denotes the maximum number of source symbols for any source
          block.
   n_r    denotes the number of repair symbols generated for a source
          block.
   n      denotes the number of encoding symbols generated for a source
          block.  Therefore: n = k + n_r.
   E      denotes the encoding symbol length in bytes.
   S      denotes the encoding symbol length in units of m-bit elements.
          When m = 8, then S and E are equal.
   GF(q)  denotes a finite field (also known as Galois Field) with q
          elements.  We assume that q = 2^^m in this document.
   m      defines the length of the elements in the finite field, in
          bits.  In this document, m belongs to {2..16}.

   q      defines the number of elements in the finite field.  We have:
          q = 2^^m in this specification.
   CR     denotes the "code rate", i.e., the k/n ratio.
   a^^b   denotes a raised to the power b.

   Some of them are FECFRAME framework specific:
   B      denotes the number of ADUs per ADU block.
   max_B  denotes the maximum number of ADUs for any ADU block.
   NumSPA (Symbols Per ADU) denotes the size of an ADUI in units of
          encoding symbols This size is constant for a given ADU block
          but may vary for different ADU blocks.  We have: 1 <= NumSPA
          <= 16.
   tot_k  denotes the total number of source symbols in an ADU block,
          tot_k = B * NumSPA.

3.3.  Abbreviations

   This document uses the following abbreviations:
   ADU    stands for Application Data Unit.
   ESI    stands for Encoding Symbol ID.
   FEC    stands for Forward Error Correction code.
   FFCI   stands for FEC Framework Configuration Information.
   RS     stands for Reed-Solomon.
   MDS    stands for Maximum Distance Separable code.


4.  Common Procedures Related to the ADU Block and Source Block Creation

   This section introduces the procedures that are used during the ADU
   block and the related source block(s) creation, for the various FEC
   schemes considered.

4.1.  Problem Statement

   Several aspects must be considered, that impact the source block
   creation:
   o  the distribution of ADU sizes for the ADU flow(s) protected by the
      FECFRAME instance;
   o  the maximum source block size (k parameter) and number of encoding
      symbols (n parameter), that are constrained by the finite field
      size (m parameter);
   o  the potential real-time constraints, that impact the maximum ADU
      block size, since the larger the block size, the larger the
      decoding delay;
   We now detail each of these aspects.

   In its most general form the FECFRAME framework and the RS FEC
   schemes are meant to protect a set of independent flows.  Since the



Roca, et al.            Expires September 9, 2010               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          Reed-Solomon FEC Schemes              March 2010


   flows have no relationship to one another, the ADU size of each flow
   will potentially vary significantly.  Even in the special case of a
   single flow, the ADU sizes may largely vary (e.g., the various frames
   of a "Group of Pictures (GOP) of an H.264 flow can have different
   sizes).  This diversity must be addressed by the source block
   creation procedure since the RS FEC scheme requires a constant
   encoding symbol size (E parameter).

   The finite field size parameter, m, defines the number of non zero
   elements in this field which is equal to: q - 1 = 2^^m - 1.  This q -
   1 value is also the theoretical maximum number of encoding symbols
   that can be produced for a source block.  For instance, when m = 8
   (default) there is a maximum of 2^^8 - 1 = 255 encoding symbols.  So:
   k < n <= 255.  Given the target FEC code rate (e.g., provided by the
   end-user or upper application when starting the FECFRAME framework,
   and taking into account the (known or estimated) packet loss rate),
   the sender calculates:
      max_k = floor((2^^m - 1) * CR)
   This max_k value leaves enough room for the sender to produce the
   desired number of repair symbols.

   The source ADU flows usually have real-time constraints.  It means
   that the maximum number of ADUs of an ADU block must not exceed a
   certain threshold since it directly impacts the decoding delay.  It
   is the role of the developer, who knows the flow real-time features,
   to define an appropriate upper bound to the ADU block size, max_B.

4.2.  Source Block Creation

   The ADU block is always encoded as a single source block.  There are
   a total of B <= max_B ADUs in this ADU block.  For the ADU i, with 0
   <= i <= B-1, 3 bytes are prepended (Figure 2):
   o  The first byte, FID[i] (Flow ID), contains the integer identifier
      associated to the source ADU flow to which this ADU belongs to.
      It is assumed that a single byte is sufficient, or said
      differently, that no more than 256 flows will be protected by a
      single instance of the FECFRAME framework.
   o  The following two bytes, L[i] (Length), contain the length of this
      ADU, in network byte order (i.e., big endian).  This length is for
      the ADU itself and does not include the FID[i], L[i], or Pad[i]
      fields.

   Let us now assume that the largest ADU of this source block, with the
   prepended 3 bytes, must be segmented into NumSPA source symbols, each
   of size E. By construction, we must have: 1 <= NumSPA <= 16.  Since E
   is fixed for the whole duration of the FECFRAME session, this also
   means that the maximum ADUI size is 16 * E bytes.

Internet-Draft          Reed-Solomon FEC Schemes              March 2010


   Then zero padding is added to ADU i (if needed) in field Pad[i], for
   alignment purposes up to a size of exactly NumSPA * E bytes.  The
   data unit resulting from the ADU and the F[], L[] and Pad[] fields,
   is called ADU Information (or ADUI).  Because of padding, each ADUI
   contributes to exactly NumSPA source symbols to the source block.
   However some of the NumSPA source symbols may be totally filled with
   zero bytes.  As a special case, the encoding symbol size (E) can be
   chosen to be equal to the largest ADUI, in which case NumSPA = 1.

   Thanks to the padding, a source symbol never straddles several ADUIs.
   As a direct consequence, a source symbol will never straddle several
   FEC source packets that are the payloads transmitted (and possibly
   erased) over the physical network.

   any) and identify the corresponding ADU flow.


5.  Reed-Solomon FEC Encoding Scheme over GF(2^^m) for Arbitrary ADU
    Flows

   This Fully-Specified FEC Scheme specifies the use of Reed-Solomon
   codes over GF(2^^m), with m in {2..16}, with a simple FEC encoding
   for arbitrary packet flows.

5.1.  Formats and Codes

5.1.1.  FEC Framework Configuration Information

   The FEC Framework Configuration Information (or FFCI) includes
   information that MUST be communicated between the sender and
   receiver(s).  More specifically, it enables the synchronization of
   the FECFRAME sender and receiver instances.  It includes both
   mandatory elements and scheme-specific elements, as detailed below.

5.1.1.1.  Mandatory Information

   o  FEC Encoding ID: the value assigned to this fully-specified FEC
      scheme MUST be XXX, as assigned by IANA (Section 8).
   When SDP is used to communicate the FFCI, this FEC Encoding ID is
   carried in the 'encoding-id' parameter.

5.1.1.2.  FEC Scheme-Specific Information

   The FEC Scheme Specific Information (FSSI) includes elements that are
   specific to the present FEC scheme.  More precisely:
   o  Encoding symbol length (E) (16 bit field): a non-negative integer
      that indicates the length of each encoding symbol in bytes.
   o  m parameter (8 bit field): an integer that defines the length of
      the elements in the finite field, in bits.  In this scheme, m
      belongs to {2..16}.
   The encoding format consists of the following 3 octet field:

    0                   1                   2
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Encoding Symbol Length (E)  |       m       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                      Figure 3: FSSI encoding format.

   These elements are required both by the sender (RS encoder) and the
   receiver(s) (RS decoder).  When SDP is used to communicate the FFCI,

   this FEC scheme-specific information is carried in the 'fssi'
   parameter as an opaque octet string, using a Base64 encoding, as
   specified in [SDP_ELEMENTS].

5.1.2.  Explicit Source FEC Payload ID

   A FEC source packet MUST contain an Explicit Source FEC Payload ID
   that is appended to the end of the packet as illustrated in Figure 4.

                              FEC Payload ID.

   More precisely, the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID is composed of the
   NumSPA, the Source Block Number and the Encoding Symbol ID.  The
   length of these two fields depends on the m parameter (transmitted
   separately in the FFCI, Section 5.1.1.2):
   Number of Source Symbols per ADU (NumSPA) (4 bit field):  this field
      provides the number of source symbols per ADU for this source
      block, i.e., the NumSPA parameter.  Though this field might be
      recovered upon receiving the first FEC repair packet for this
      block, i.e., just on time before doing FEC decoding, it is
      transmitted in the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID too in order to
      simplify source block preparation at the receiver while receiving
      FEC source packets.
   Source Block Number (SBN) (32-m bit field):  this field identifies
      the source block to which this FEC source packet belongs.
   Encoding Symbol ID (ESI) (m bit field):  this field identifies the
      first source symbol associated to this FEC source packet in the
      source block (remember there can be several source symbols per
      ADUI, Section 4.2).  This value belongs to interval {0..k - 1}
      inclusive for source symbols.

   The format of the Source FEC Payload ID for m = 8 and m = 16 are
   illustrated in Figure 5 and Figure 6 respectively.

5.1.3.  Repair FEC Payload ID

   A FEC repair packet MUST contain a Repair FEC Payload ID that is
   prepended to the repair symbol(s) as illustrated in Figure 7.  There
   can be several repair symbols per repair packet.

   the Source Block Number, the Encoding Symbol ID, and the Source Block
   Length.  The length of some of these fields depends on the m
   parameter (transmitted separately in the FFCI, Section 5.1.1.2):
   Number of Source Symbols per ADU (NumSPA) (4 bit field):  this field
      provides the number of source symbols per ADU for this source
      block, i.e., the NumSPA parameter.

   Source Block Number (SBN) (28-m bit field):  this field identifies
      the source block to which the FEC repair packet belongs.
   Encoding Symbol ID (ESI) (m bit field)  this field identifies the
      first repair symbol contained in this FEC repair packet (remember
      there can be several repair symbols per FEC repair packet).  This
      value belongs to interval {k..n - k - 1} inclusive for repair
      symbols.
   Source Block Length (k) (16 bit field):  this field provides the
      number of source symbols for this source block, i.e., the k
      parameter.  If 16 bits are too much when m <= 8, it is needed when
      8 < m <= 16.

   The format of the Repair FEC Payload ID for m = 8 and m = 16 are
   illustrated in Figure 8 and Figure 9 respectively.

   The actual number of repair symbols contained in a FEC repair packet
   can be determined by the receiver by comparing the FEC repair packet
   length, PL, and the encoding symbol length, E, (transmitted in the
   FFCI).  More precisely, this number is given by SN = PL / E. When
   multiple repair symbols are sent in the same FEC repair packet, the
   FEC Payload ID refers to the first repair symbol.  The other repair
   symbols can be deduced from the ESI of the first repair symbol by
   incrementing sequentially this ESI.

5.2.  Procedures

   The following procedures apply:
   o  The source block creation procedures are specified in Section 4.2.
   o  The SBN value is incremented for each new source block, starting
      at 0 for the first block of the ADU flow.  Wrapping to zero will
      happen for long sessions, after value 2^^(32-m) - 1.
   o  The ESI of source symbols is managed sequentially, starting at 0
      for the first symbol.  There are a maximum of 2^^m encoding
      symbols per block.  The first k values (from 0 to k - 1 inclusive)
      identify source symbols, whereas the last n-k values (from k to n
      - k - 1 inclusive) identify repair symbols.
   o  The FEC repair packet creation procedures are specified in
      Section 5.1.3.

5.3.  FEC Code Specification

   The present document inherits from [RFC5510] the specification of the
   core Reed-Solomon codes based on Vandermonde matrices for a packet
   transmission channel.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Problem Statement

   A content delivery system is potentially subject to many attacks.
   Some of them target the network (e.g., to compromise the routing
   infrastructure, by compromising the congestion control component),
   others target the Content Delivery Protocol (CDP) (e.g., to
   compromise its normal behavior), and finally some attacks target the
   content itself.  Since this document focuses on various FEC schemes,
   this section only discusses the additional threats that their use
   within the FECFRAME framework can create to an arbitrary CDP.

   More specifically, these attacks may have several goals:
   o  those that are meant to give access to a confidential content
      (e.g., in case of a non-free content),
   o  those that try to corrupt the ADU Flows being transmitted (e.g.,
      to prevent a receiver from using it),





Roca, et al.            Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft          Reed-Solomon FEC Schemes              March 2010


   o  and those that try to compromise the receiver's behavior (e.g., by
      making the decoding of an object computationally expensive).
   These attacks can be launched either against the data flow itself
   (e.g., by sending forged FEC Source/Repair Packets) or against the
   FEC parameters that are sent either in-band (e.g., in the Repair FEC
   Payload ID) or out-of-band (e.g., in a session description).

7.2.  Attacks Against the Data Flow

   First of all, let us consider the attacks against the data flow.

7.2.1.  Access to Confidential Contents

   Access control to the ADU Flow being transmitted is typically
   provided by means of encryption.  This encryption can be done within
   the content provider itself, by the application (for instance by
   using the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711]), or
   at the Network Layer, on a packet per packet basis when IPSec/ESP is
   used [RFC4303].  If confidentiality is a concern, it is RECOMMENDED
   that one of these solutions be used.  Even if we mention these
   attacks here, they are not related nor facilitated by the use of FEC.

7.2.2.  Content Corruption

   Protection against corruptions (e.g., after sending forged FEC
   Source/Repair Packets) is achieved by means of a content integrity
   verification/sender authentication scheme.  This service is usually
   provided at the packet level.  In this case, after removing all
   forged packets, the ADU Flow may be sometimes recovered.  Several
   techniques can provide this source authentication/content integrity
   service:
   o  at the application level, the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
      (SRTP) [RFC3711] provides several solutions to authenticate the
      source and check the integrity of RTP and RTCP messages, among
      other services.  For instance, associated to the Timed Efficient
      Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) [RFC4383], SRTP is an
      attractive solution that is robust to losses, provides a true
      authentication/integrity service, and does not create any
      prohibitive processing load or transmission overhead.  Yet,
      checking a packet requires a small delay (a second or more) after
      its reception with TESLA.  Other building blocks can be used
      within SRTP to provide authentication/content integrity services.
   o  at the Network Layer, IPSec/ESP offers (among other services) an
      integrity verification mechanism that can be used to provide
      authentication/content integrity services.

   It is up to the developer and deployer, who know the security
   requirements and features of the target application area, to define



Roca, et al.            Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft          Reed-Solomon FEC Schemes              March 2010


   which solution is the most appropriate.  Nonetheless it is
   RECOMMENDED that at least one of these techniques be used.

7.3.  Attacks Against the FEC Parameters

   Let us now consider attacks against the FEC parameters included in
   the FFCI that are usually sent out-of-band (e.g., in a session
   description).  Attacks on these FEC parameters can prevent the
   decoding of the associated object.  For instance modifying the m
   field (when applicable) will lead a receiver to consider a different
   code.  Modifying the E parameter will lead a receiver to consider bad
   Repair Symbols for a received FEC Repair Packet.

   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures be taken to
   guarantee the FFCI integrity.  When the FFCI is sent out-of-band in a
   session description, this latter SHOULD be protected, for instance by
   digitally signing it.

   Attacks are also possible against some FEC parameters included in the
   Explicit Source FEC Payload ID and Repair FEC Payload ID.  For
   instance modifying the Source Block Number of a FEC Source of Repair
   Packet will lead a receiver to assign this packet to a wrong block.

   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures be taken to
   guarantee the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID and Repair FEC Payload
   ID integrity.  To that purpose, one of the packet-level source
   authentication/content integrity techniques of Section 7.2.2 can be
   used.


8.  IANA Considerations

   Values of FEC Encoding IDs are subject to IANA registration.
