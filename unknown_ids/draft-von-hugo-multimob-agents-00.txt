Abstract

   This document describes an approach to support mobile IPv6 multicast 
   listeners and senders located within a moving network (NEMO).  A NEMO
   is built up by at least one Mobile Router (MR) and a set of Mobile 
   Network Nodes (MNNs).  The MR handles all routing related tasks to 
   provide connectivity between the MNNs and an access network   
   including mobility management.  Correspondingly the MR also 
   subscribes to multicast groups and forwards emerging multicast 
   traffic on behalf of a MNN.
   For optimised routing of multicast data a hierarchical multicast   
   agent is introduced as a logical entity providing an anchor to the 
   multicast tree.  In the MR a corresponding functionality is defined 
   which decides on the location of the specific agent to be used for a 
   distinct multicast traffic.

1. Introduction

   IP Multicast is a resource efficient measure for many promising new 
   mobile applications which often require definite QoS degrees and low 
   delay characteristics (e.g. for video streaming).  The regular change 
   of the point of attachment (PoA) to the access network infrastructure

   due to mobility, however, is a challenge to preservation of a 
   continuously high quality of multicast service: either routing paths 
   may increase unduly high or a frequent update of branches or even - 
   in case of a moving source of multicast traffic - of the complete 
   multicast tree will occur. 

   A detailed comparison of several approaches towards multicast 
   mobility has been provided in [10].  However, an efficient solution 
   to the problem turns out to be complex and hence will require effort 
   in processing power and energy consumption.  Thus the implementation 
   of such a solution at a MR instead of each individual MN will 
   contribute to overall resource savings, as with a MR within a NEMO a 
   single entity for mobile multicast control will serve a plurality of 
   terminal nodes.

   This document introduces an approach for mobile IPv6 multicast    
   listeners and senders located within moving networks (NEMO). A NEMO 
   is characterised by a Mobile Router (MR) and several mobile network 
   nodes (MNNs).  The terminology used in this document remains 
   conformal to the definitions in the corresponding NEMO document [5].  
   All mobility related functionalities are performed by the MR on 
   behalf of the MNNs as specified by the NEMO basic support protocol 
   [2].  Here additionally the MR also manages Multicast subscription 
   and traffic forwarding instead of the nodes inside the NEMO.  The 
   approach described in the following was implemented within the 
   framework of ongoing EU IST project Daidalos (Designing Advanced 
   network Interfaces for the Delivery and Administration of Location 
   independent, Optimised personal Services [8, 12]).  An entity was 
   developped which controls multicast traffic distribution and 
   reception within the NEMO by means of deciding and selecting the way 
   to handle multicast, i.e. the routing path to be chosen.

2. NEMO Multicast

   Control of mobile multicast service related to NEMO is governed by 
   the following general principle: All corresponding traffic emerging 
   and terminating inside the NEMO is handled via the MR without 
   interception from outside.  Data aimed at nodes outside the NEMO are 
   tunnelled to a Multicast Anchor Agent (MAA) to separate mobility 
   issues from the multicast tree.  This MAA is selected depending on 
   multicast traffic and NEMO movement characteristics.  Multicast 
   traffic is characterised e.g. by session duration, direction to or 
   from the NEMO, and existing subscription status.  NEMO movement is 
   typically given by frequency of change of PoA (handover rate).  By 
   default and in case of high handover rate the MR's HA is selected as 
   MAA thus representing Mobile IPv6 [3] well-known approach of 
   bi-directional tunnelling (BT).  In case of zero velocity of the MR    
   or slow movement compared to session duration the current Access   
   Router (AR) is chosen as MAA i.e. the approach of remote subscription

   (RS) also described in [3] is employed.  For all other situations the 
   dynamic allocation of the MAA will come up with either a former AR 
   which has been previously visited or an expected future AR where the 
   MR will likely attach to. Alternatively a dedicated static 
   hierarchical multicast agent which is known to the MR through regular 
   advertisements may be selected.  In any case the choice for the MAA 
   has to be governed by the attempt to further reduce time delay and 
   overhead effort e.g. on path re-construction after handover.  The MAA 
   approach combines the strengths of BT in terms of low multicast tree 
   reconstruction and RS in terms of minimum routing path distance, 
   respectively, while counteracting their disadvantages.

2.1. Multicast Agent procedure

   Upon subscription of an MNN within the NEMO to a multicast group, the 
   MR forwards the multicast data via a dedicated tunnel to the MAA 
   which the MR has correspondingly decided on.  In case of subscription 
   as receiver the request is forwarded utilizing the MLDv2 (Multicast 
   Listener Discovery Version 2) [4] protocol.  In case of transmission 
   of originating traffic addressed to a multicast group the traffic 
   data are sent to the MAA for further distribution.

   Corresponding multicast traffic received at the MAA is subsequently 
   forwarded by the MAA back to the MR via the bi-directional tunnel. 
   This MLD-proxy functionality has been described for the HA as MAA in 
   [9].

   To decide on an optimal MAA router the MR may operate a list of 
   already established intermediate routers (e.g. former ARs) to 
   subscribe to the multicast group on behalf of the MR. Such a 
   technique of using an AR as a Dynamic Multicast Agent (DMA) has been 
   proposed in [11].  In extension to that approach this draft 
   introduces an entity at the MR which performs selection and decision 
   on the site where the Multicast agent should be located.  Advantage 
   of this approach is that the access network infrastructure is less 
   affected by required update of functionality. On the other hand the 
   mobile multicast control entity may be adapted to usage at future 
   mobile nodes with corresponding capability.

   The selection procedure at the MR entity is done via an intelligent 
   algorithm which uses information on the current movement of the MR 
   (handover rate) and the distance between MR and a potential MAA 
   (amount of routing path hops).  For this the MR maintains a data base 
   of recorded NEMO attachment history and checks path increment of 
   recently visited PoAs or ARs as well as potential new candidates.  A 
   bi-directional tunnel established between MR and old AR e.g. via 
   Generic Packet Tunneling described in RFC 2473 [6] is used for 


von Hugo                 Expires April 11, 2008                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          Agent-based NEMO Multicast         October 2007 


   forwarding multicast group management messages and multicast traffic. 
   Derivation of distance may be done via already established or 
   correspondingly adapted functionalities as e.g. described in [7].
   The MR may send out an MLD query to a new candidate MAA, the reply on 
   which contains the distance in terms of number of hops.  In case of 
   an existing multicast relation the actual group management messages
   allow for hop count at receiver side via header hop limit decremental
   analysis.  Actual Multicast group subscription at the different (old 
   ones and currently serving) ARs is also taken into account to re-use 
   existing group relations and already transmitted/received multicast 
   traffic there in order to save amount of subscription messages and 
   transmission resources.
   
   Depending on the actual decision also multiple paths towards 
   different MAAs set up via a tunnel mechanism may be used for 
   different multicast groups (flows/sessions) and traffic directions 
   (source/reception).

   To summarise the tasks of new functional entities to be established 
   at the MR are

   o  to forward multicast group management messages and traffic between 
      MNN and the multicast infrastructure via a tunnel towards the 
      selected Multicast Agent (MAA at current AR, old or new AR, MR's 
      HA or hierarchical Multicast Agent)

   o  to keep and update address, distance and multicast group 
      subscription status as entries for the current and former 
      Multicast Agents to provide information for dynamic selection of 
      the actually used Multicast Agent (default value is MR's HA)

   o  to retrieve current AR information and handover status

   o  to decide on optimum Multicast Agent based on movement, distance, 
      AR subscription status, and session/flow information

   An overview on the exchanged messages and initiated traffic flow   
   between end user at MNN and corresponding agent with connection to   
   Multicast environment is shown in Figure 1.

   Here the MAA may be located at any other node in the access network 
   in between the current AR and the MR's HA.  MC denotes the ability of 
   a node to receive and transmit MultiCast traffic and group management 
   messages via protocols as PIM etc. within a Multicast enabled 
   environment.

3. Open issues

   The approach described above up to now only considers Local Fixed 
   Nodes (LFNs) as MNNs.  Further optimisation of Multicast support for 
   the situation of Visiting Mobile Nodes (VMNs) and the attachmant of 
   further NEMOs to an MR (nested NEMO) requires measures to transfer 
   beside Multicast group information also history on prior assigned 
   MAAs to update the data base with.

   Also the investigation on how to proceed to a proactive decision for   
   proper MMA during handover would require further investigation which 
   is currently out of scope for the document.

4. Security Considerations

   This document covers an approach to support Multicast service for     
   Moving Networks. Security issues considered for NEMO [9] also apply 
   here.  Threats for Multicast group control messages and issues to 
   verify a Multicast agents identity have to be addressed by future 
   solutions.

5. IANA Considerations

   No assumptions on IANA registry have been regarded in this draft.   
   Therefore this document has no actions for IANA.

6. Conclusions

   Within this draft an approach for more efficient mobile multicast 
   data communication with respect to moving networks has been 
   presented.  Improved routing solutions in the framework of IPv6 
   network mobility as enabled by IETF protocol NEMO (RFC 3963 [2]) has 
   been developed and implemented within the Daidalos I demonstrator 
   operated under Linux.  The approach to increase efficiency of 
   multicast traffic in mobile networks is based on a proposed decision 
   procedure to optimise the choice of the serving multicast agent which 
   relies on characteristics as service parameters, traffic origination, 
   and rate of movement of the mobile networks.
