1.  Introduction

   While more and more operators begin to provide the wireless broadband
   network systems, the needs for multicast and and broadcast service in
   mobile network become more and more promising.  Recently IPTV might
   become one of the killer applications for mobile network.  Mobile
   IPTV service is a kind of A/V services which are combined with
   interactive data for the related or supplementary information of A/V
   program using bi-directional wireless broadband links.  User can
   enjoy the downlink A/V stream and access more detailed or value-added
   information via uplink simultaneously.  Mobile IPTV service, which is
   also described as place-shifting IPTV service in [IPTV.SR.SC],
   basically is to ensure continuous and original IPTV experiences for
   the users who move to the other place from where he or she originally
   subscribed for.

   As specified in [IPTV.SR.SC], mobile IPTV (place-shifting) could be
   divided into two categories, depending on who is taking care of
   redistributing the IPTV traffic:

   The subscriber-based solution requires the device of subsrcriber to
   redistributes traffic to the place where the user is currently
   located.

   The network-based one need the service provider send the IPTV traffic
   to the moved place. while mobile IPTV users handover from one network
   domain to another network domain, the network side should guarantee
   the service continuity and smoothness.

   Mobile IPTV service is a mass multimedia group communication service.
   It has more requirements on network bandwidth and QoS/QoE compared
   with best effort data services.  As desribed in [Schmidt07],
   multicast is optimal to support this kind of group communication
   service in mobile network.  The problems and survey could be found in
   [Schmidt07].  This document only discusses the problems and
   requirement of mobile multicast.

   In the IPv6 network, Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)[RFC3775] is the basic way to
   support mobility.  It allows the mobile nodes(MN) to maintain the
   reachability while moving in the IPv6 network.  After registration to
   home agent(HA), the packets destined to MN could be routed correctly
   by using the end-to-end tunnel, while MN is away from the home
   network.  MIPv6 has some other extensions (HMIP6 [RFC4140], FMIP6
   [RFC4068], PMIP6 [Gundavelli07])for different application schemes.
   MIPv6 has two methods for multicast.  [Schmidt07] has already
   analysis on the Prons and Cons of these two ways.

   Besides the MIP camp, there are some specific multicast solutions in

   3GPP(MBMS)[MBMS] and 3GPP2 network(BCMCS)[BCMCS].  There is the
   possiblity that access gateway may experience the overload to support
   this kind of services.  Anyhow, In the real deployment, BCMCS/MBMS
   may not always available anywhere in operators' cellular network,they
   could also support the mobile IPTV services in cellular networks.

2.  Requirements on multicast mobility management for mobile IPTV

2.1.  (Mobile) IPTV multicast framework

   [IPTV.MC.FR] and [IPTV.FR] make detailed description on IPTV
   architecture and multicast framewroks.  Mobile IPTV content delivery
   infrastructure may consists of four different layers, i.e.  Content
   Source, Core, Metro(Edge), and Access.  Content source is where IPTV
   service contents are originated and they can be placed in either
   inside or outside of delivery infrastructure.  Core is service/
   network provider_is backbone infrastructure.  Metro, in other words
   Aggregation or Edge, is where it connects and aggregates between core
   and access.  Access is user domain that includes last mile.

   The transport profile of Mobile IPTV are shown in the picture below:

             Wired or Wireless
                   |
                   | +.........................................+
   +----------+    | . Mobile IPTV Transport Profile           .
   |  Mobile  |    V .  +--------+      +------+      +------+ .
   |   IPTV   |---------| Access |------| Edge |------| Core | .
   | Terminal |      .  +--------+      +------+      +------+ .
   +----------+      .                    //           ||  ||  .
                     .                   //            ||  ||  .
                     .    +-------------+              ||  ||  .
                     .    | Content     |==============||  ||  .
                     .    | Source      |                  ||  .
                     .    +-------------+                  ||  .
                     +................\\...................||..+
                                       \\                  ||
                                        +----------------+ ||
                                        | content source |==
                                        +----------------+


   Besides the functions showen in the picture above, multicast delivery
   control functions are needed for the Mobile IPTV Transport profile.
   They may be responsible for the multicast tree managerment,
   membership management, authentication and authorization of members,
   QoS management, load and traffic mamangement

2.2.  Service Requirements Mobile IPTV multicast delivery

   [IPTV.SR.REQ] specified the service requirements of (Mobile) IPTV.
   [IPTV.QoE.REQ] gives the requirements related to QoS and QoE.  Mobile
   IPTV service includes multiple type of services, such as video,
   audio, data(captures, EPG, etc.).  Video service need much bandwidth



Deng, et al.               Expires May 8, 2008                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               PS-MC Mobile-TV               November 2007


   and also should be a service with high service quality.  Network
   should implement traffic control for high priority multicast traffic
   to ensure the QOS of multicast.  Specifically, following functions
   should be supported in the mobile network:

   (1)Total Multicast Bandwidth: access node should be able to control
   on total bandwidth of a user port that can be used for multicast
   service;

   (2)Current Available Bandwidth: the access node should be able to
   aware of current available bandwidth that can be used for multicast
   service, specifically, can be total multicast bandwidth consumed
   multicast bandwidth;

   (3)Connection Admission Control (CAC): It is required that Connection
   Admission Control supported in Access network based on available
   resources.  When end user subscribes to a multicast stream, access
   network will perform CAC: check if current available resources are
   enough for the new service subscription.  The resources can be
   bandwidth, connection number and user service privilege profile.

   (4) Network Attachment Control: The attachment control should be
   supported by the multicast control function and multicast replication
   function.  The multicast control function should build the privilege
   table for multicast users, and the multicast replication function
   should forward multicast media content to users which have the
   privilege of IPTV multicast services.

   (5) Packet loss: depending on the bit rate and video/audio profiles,
   the video and audio streams have different levels of sensitiveness on
   packet loss.  [IPTV.QoE.REQ] gives the detail of packet loss
   requirements for all kinds of real-time mobile IPTV media streams.
   The multicast mobile network should gurantee not only the duration of
   single error, but also the total packet loss rate.  Besides the
   packet loss at radio interface, the multicast handoff will also incur
   some packet loss.

   (6) Packet priority: considering the video/audio compression
   characteristics, different packets may have different importance.  It
   is recommended to provide better guarantee for important packets.

   (7) Synchronization: Mobile IPTV services is also an integrated
   service with synchronized multiple streams.  Although the service
   provider and the terminal may have some solution to maintain
   synchronized streams, the mobile network may also incur delay and
   jitter.  So, the mobile multicast should provide some machenism to
   ensure the synchronization of mobile IPTV streams.

   (8) Notification: there are some mobile IPTV service events, which
   will trigger notification messages.  The multicast mobile network
   should understand such kind of notifications and make the actions
   accordingly.  In this sense, a notifiction solution among the nodes
   of multicast mobile network mya be useful.

2.3.  Correspondence Mobile IPv6 to support Multicast for mobile IPTV?

   Many works have made the analysis on the multicast solution in mobile
   IPv6.  [Schmidt07] has the summary of all the related works.  In this
   document, the analysis on multicast of mobile IPv6 will be made only
   based on mobile IPTV.  The Home Agent(HA) may be part of the core
   function in the mobile IPTV framework.  The edge function normally
   coould be considered as the access gateway(AGW) in the deployment of
   mobile IPv6 in mobile network.

   Bandwidth efficiency: The advantage of the bi-directional tunneling
   solution is its simplicity and the transparency of handover to the
   multicast operation.  This approach is inefficient because of the
   tunnel overhead and delay.  The multiple unicasting tunneling problem
   for multicast between HA and MN should be solved to improve the
   bandwidth efficientcy.  In the deployment of mobile IPv6 in wireless
   network (cellular, WLAN or WIMAX), HA (core) is relatively close to
   the AGW(Edge).  So, the delay issue because of triangle tunneling may
   not be so severe.

   Packet loss: the mobile IPTV services consist of real-time video/
   audio streams.  So, the short delay/seamless multicast handoff of
   mobile IPv6 is surely useful.

   Synchronization: the requirements include the synchronization among
   all the nodes of mobile IPv6 and the synchronization between the
   mobile IPTV streams.  Firstly, a precise time reference is needed in
   the multicast mobile network.  Secondly, the synchronization
   information is necessary in the mobile IPTV streams.  Lastly, some
   notification messages may be useful to share some time-based mobile
   IPTV events among mobile IPv6 nodes.  It's also useful for precise
   mobile IPTV and multicast network charging.Proxy Mobile IPv6 has some
   basic requirement about synchronization between LMA and MAG for
   several considerations.

   Notification: it's recommended to have some notification machenism in
   mobile IPv6.  It's useful to do synchronous actions for incoming
   mobile IPTV service events.

3.  One Problem about Mobile Multicast

   The current MBMS which is defined in 3GPP [MBMS] may experience
   overload for each network entity such as access gateway and
   broadcast/multicast server, in the case of mobile node frequently
   join and quit from the multicast group, multicast service
   announcement may also need to be reconsidered.

4.  Security Considerations

   Multicast security is one of the most crucial issues in mobile IPTV
   service such that it is required to provide security capabilities to
   protect mobile IPTV multicast network from any malicious attempts
   caused by multicast security holes.  Security itself is too diverse
   to break down to the specific multicast purpose; however functional
   requirements of multicast security for each network elements should
   be clearly defined and should provide capabilities along with the
   definitions.

   As specified in [IPTV.SEC], the mobile IPTV security requirements may
   have following aspects:

   - IPTV architecture is required to be robust against denial of
   service attacks targeting any multicast mechanisms.

   - Multicast system architecture is required to provide a mechanism of
   multicast protocol adjacency authentication in order to establish a
   reliable peer.

   - Multicast system architecture is required to provide an admission
   control mechanism to regulate any multicast events.

   - Multicast system architecture is required to be independent of
   adjacent domain such that it shall not affect the adjacent multicast
   domain without permission.

   - Multicast system architecture is required to provide a mechanism to
   check integrity of multicast contents before service delivery such
   that it prevents unauthorized contents from becoming the content
   source.

   IPTV services.  Firstly the mobile IPTV multicast framework is
   described followed by its the requirements on multicast mobile
   networks.  The impacts on current mobile IPv6 multicast solutions are
