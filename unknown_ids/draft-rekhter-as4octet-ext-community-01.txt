Abstract

   This document defines a new type of a BGP extended community - four-
   octet AS specific extended community. This community allows to carry
   4 octet autonomous system numbers.


Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].












1. Introduction

   This document defines a new type of a BGP ([BGP]) extended community
   ([EXT-COMM]) - four-octet AS specific extended community. This type
   of extended community is similar to the two-octet AS specific
   extended community, except that it can carry a four octets autonomous
   system number.


2. Four-octet AS specific extended community

   This is an extended type with Type Field comprising of 2 octets and
   Value Field comprising of 6 octets.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | 0x02 or 0x42  |   Sub-Type    |    Global Administrator       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Global Administrator (cont.)  |    Local Administrator        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The value of the high-order octet of this extended type is either
   0x02 or 0x42. The low-order octet of this extended type is used to
   indicate sub-types.

   The Value Field consists of two sub-fields:

      Global Administrator sub-field: 4 octets

         This sub-field contains a 4-octets Autonomous System number
         assigned by IANA.

      Local Administrator sub-field: 2 octets

         The organization identified by Autonomous System number in the
         Global Administrator sub-field, can encode any information in
         this sub-field.  The format and meaning of the value encoded in
         this sub-field should be defined by the sub-type of the
         community.


3. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a class of extended communities called four-
   octet AS specific extended community for which the IANA is to create
   and maintain a registry entitled Four-octet AS Specific Extended
   Community. All the communities in this class are of extended Types.
   Future assignment are to be made using the "First Come First Served"
   policy defined in [RFC2434]. The Type values for the transitive
   communities of the two-octet AS specific extended community class are
   0x0200-0x02ff, and for the non-transitive communities of that class
   are 0x4200-0x42ff. Assignments consist of a name and the value.

   This document makes the following assignments for the four-octet AS
   specific extended community:

      Name                                     Type Value
      ----                                     ----------
      four-octet AS specific Route Target       0x0202
      four-octet AS specific Route Origin       0x0203


4. Security Considerations

   All the security considerations for BGP Extended Communities apply
   here.


5. Intellectual Property Considerations

   This section is taken from Section 5 of RFC 3668.

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any

   might or might not be available; nor does it represent that it has
   made any independent effort to identify any such rights.  Information
   on the procedures with respect to rights in RFC documents can be
   found in BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Copies of IPR disclosures made to the IETF Secretariat and any
   assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an
   attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of
   such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this
   specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR repository at
   http://www.ietf.org/ipr.
