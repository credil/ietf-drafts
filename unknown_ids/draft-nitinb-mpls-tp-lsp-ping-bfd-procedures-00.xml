    <abstract>
      <t>LSP-Ping and BFD for MPLS are existing and widely deployment OAM
      mechanisms for MPLS LSPs. This document describes how LSP-Ping and BFD
      for MPLS can be used to perform OAM on MPLS-TP LSPs. This document
      describes extensions to LSP-Ping when IP addressing is not in use, in a
      MPLS-TP deployment scenario. These extensions are also meant to be
      applicable when it is desirable to avoid the use of IP encapsulation for
      exchanging LSP-Ping OAM messages. This document also clarifies the use
      of BFD for MPLS-TP LSPs when IP addressing may not be available and/or
      it may not be desirable to encapsulate BFD packets in IP.</t>

      <t>LSP-Ping <xref target="RFC4379"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-bfd-mpls"></xref> are OAM mechanisms for MPLS LSPs.
      This document describes how LSP-Ping and BFD for MPLS can be used to
      perform OAM on MPLS-TP LSPs. The document considers two cases. The first
      is when IP addressing and host stack are available on egress and transit
      LSRs. The second is when such capabilities are either not available or
      it is not desirable to use them.</t>

      <t>Sections <xref target="lsp-ping-ping"></xref> and <xref
      target="lsp-ping-trace"></xref> describes the theory of operation for
      performing LSP-Ping over MPLS-TP LSPs. Section <xref
      target="ach-header"></xref> describes the new TLVs and LSP-Ping
      extensions for performing LSP-Ping in the absence of IP addressing.</t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

      </section>

      <section title="Existing LSP-Ping and BFD for MPLS LSPs Encapsulation Mechanism">
        <t>LSP-Ping requires IP addressing on the egress and transit LSRs for
        performing OAM on MPLS signaled LSPs and pseudowires. BFD for MPLS
        LSPs also requires IP addressing. In particular, in these cases the
        LSP-Ping and BFD packets generated by an ingress LSR are encapsulated
        in an IP/UDP header with the destination address from the 127/8 range
        and then encapsulated in the MPLS label stack (<xref
        target="RFC4379"></xref> , <xref target="I-D.ietf-bfd-mpls"></xref>).
        Egress LSRs use the presence of the 127/8 destination address to
        identify the OAM packets and rely further on the UDP port number to
        determine whether the packet is a LSP-Ping or a BFD packet. It is to
        be noted that this determination does not require IP forwarding
        capabilities. It requires the presence of an IP host stack which
        enables egress LSRs to process packets with a destination address from
        the 127/8 range. <xref target="RFC1122"></xref> allocates the 127/8
        range as "Internal host loopback address" and <xref
        target="RFC1812"></xref> states that "a router SHOULD NOT forward,
        except over a loopback interface, any packet that has a destination
        address on network 127".</t>

        <t>LSP-Ping and BFD for MPLS specify procedures that allow an egress
        LSR to use a MPLS LSP for forwarding LSP-Ping or BFD packets to the
        ingress LSR. This ensures that IP forwarding capabilities are not
        required and meets the MPLS-TP requirement of not having IP forwarding
        capabilities.</t>

        <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-framework"></xref> specifies that IP
        addressing is the default addressing mechanism for MPLS-TP networks.
        An IP host stack must be present when IP addressing is in use. This
        implies that exisiting LSP-Ping and BFD procedures can be used as is
        in MPLS-TP environments when IP addressing is in use.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Non-IP LSP-Ping and BFD for MPLS LSPs Encapsulation Mechanism">
        <t>In certain MPLS-TP deployment scenarios IP addressing might not be
        available or it may be preferred to use non-IP encapsulation for
        LSP-Ping and BFD packets. To enable re-use of OAM techniques provided
        by LSP-Ping and BFD in such networks, rest of this document defines
        extensions to LSP-Ping and procedures for using BFD. The document
        defines a new code-point for using LSP-Ping with an ACH header.
        Further, it describes how LSP-Ping can be used to perform Connectivity
        Verification, Route Tracing and Adjacency functions specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements"></xref>. This document also
        clarifies the usage of BFD in the context of MPLS-TP LSPs.</t>

        <t>Sections <xref target="lsp-ping-ping"></xref> and <xref
        target="lsp-ping-trace"></xref> describe the theory of operation for
        performing LSP-Ping over MPLS-TP LSPs with a non-IP encapsulation.
        <xref target="ach-header"></xref> describes the new TLVs and LSP-Ping
        extensions for performing LSP-Ping in the absence of IP addressing.

        <t>Traditional LSP-Ping packets ride over the LSP and contain an
        IP/UDP packet within them. The IP header is not used for forwarding
        (since the LSP is forwarded using MPLS label switching). The IP header
        is used mainly for addressing and can be used in the context of
        MPLS-TP LSPs. This form of LSP-Ping OAM MUST be supported for MPLS-TP
        LSPs when IP addressing is in use. The figure below shows an MPLS-TP

        header and no IP and/or UDP headers MUST be attached. If the request
        message contained the Source Address TLV and a response is being sent
        to the originator, then a Destination Address TLV (<xref
        target="dest-addr-tlv"></xref>) SHOULD be added to the reply message.
        The contents of the LSP-Ping request Source Address TLV should be
        copied into the LSP-Ping response Destination Address TLV. The
        responding node MAY attach a Source Address TLV to identify the node
        sending the response.</t>

      <section title="P2MP Considerations">
        <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping"></xref> describes how
        LSP-Ping can be used for OAM on P2MP LSPs. The procedures described in
        this draft apply as is irrespective of whether we use the mechanism
        specified in <xref target="lsp-ping-traditional"></xref> or the

    <section title="Performing LSP Traceroute over MPLS-TP LSPs">
      <t>This section specifies how LSP-Ping traceroute can be used in the
      context of MPLS-TP LSPs. The LSP-Ping traceroute function meets the
      Adjancency and Route Tracing requirement specified in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements"></xref>.</t>

      <t>When performing lsp-ping traceroute, the ingress node inserts a
      Downstream Mapping TLV to get the downstream node information and to
      enable LSP verification along the transit nodes. The Downstream mapping
      TLV can be used as is for performing the traceroute. If IP addressing is
      not in use, then the Address Type field in the Downstream Mapping TLV
      can be set to "Not applicable" (<xref target="dsmap-addr-type"></xref>).
      The Downstream Mapping TLV address type field can be extended to include
      other address types as need be.</t>

      <section anchor="lsp-trace-traditional"
               title="Traditional LSP Traceroute">
        <t>The mechanics of LSP-Ping traceroute are similar to those described
        for ping in <xref target="lsp-ping-traditional"></xref>. Traceroute
        packets sent by the lsp ingress MUST adhere to the format described in
        <xref target="lsp-ping-ping"></xref>.This form of LSP-Ping OAM MUST be
        supported for MPLS-TP LSPs, when IP addressing is in use.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="lsp-ping-trace" title="Non-IP based LSP Traceroute">
        <t>This section describes the procedures for performing lsp-traceroute
        when using the ACH header and without any dependency on IP addressing.
        The procedures specified in <xref target="lsp-ping-ping"></xref> with
        regards to Source Address TLV and Destination Address TLV apply to LSP
        traceroute as well.</t>

        <section title="Ingress node procedure for sending echo request packets">
          <t>Traceroute packets sent by the lsp ingress MUST adhere to the
          format described in <xref target="lsp-ping-ping"></xref>. MPLS-TTL
          expiry (as described in <xref target="RFC4379"></xref>) will be used
          to direct the packets to specific nodes along the LSP path.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Ingress node procedure for receiving echo response packets">
          <t>The lsp-ping traceroute responses will be received on the LSP
          itself and the presence of an ACH header with channel type of
          LSP-Ping is an indicator that the packet contains LSP-ping
          payload.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Transit and egress node procedure">
          <t>When a echo request reaches the transit or egress, the presence
          of the ACH channel type of LSP-Ping will indicate that the packet
          contains LSP-Ping data. The LSP-Ping data and the label stack should
          be able to identify the LSP associated with the echo request packet.
          In case if there is an error and the node is unable to idenfity the
          LSP on which the echo response should to be sent, the node MUST drop
          the echo request packet and not send any response back. All
          responses MUST always be sent on a LSP path using the ACH header and
          ACH channel type of LSP-Ping.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="ECMP Considerations">
        <t>LSP-Ping using ACH SHOULD NOT be used when there is ECMP (equal
        cost multiple paths) for a given LSP. The addition of the additional
        ACH header may modify the hashing behavior for OAM packets which may
        result in incorrect modeling of path taken by data traffic.</t>

    <section anchor="bfd-mpls-tp" title="Running BFD over MPLS-TP LSPs">
      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-bfd-mpls"></xref> describes how BFD can be
      used for Continuity Check for MPLS LSPs. When IP addressing is in use,
      the procedures described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-bfd-mpls"></xref>
      apply as is. This section clarifies the usage of BFD in the context of
      MPLS-TP LSPs when it is not desirable to use IP encapsulation. When
      using BFD over MPLS-TP LSPs, the BFD descriminator MAY either be
      signaled via LSP-Ping or be statically configured. The BFD packets MUST
      be sent over ACH when IP encapsulation is not used. BFD packets, for
      both directions, MUST be sent over the MPLS-TP LSP and IP forwarding
      SHOULD NOT be used for the reverse path. The format of a BFD packet when
      using it as an OAM tool for MPLS-TP LSPs SHOULD be as follows:</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-vccv-bfd"></xref> specifies how BFD can
      be used over MPLS PWs. Of specific interest are 2 modes:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Channel type is IP and payload contains BFD packet with IP/UDP
          headers.</t>

          <t>Channel type is BFD and payload contains BFD packet without
          IP/UDP headers.</t>
        </list>The first mode MUST be supported for BFD over MPLS-TP LSPs. The
      second mode MAY be supported in addition.</t>

      <t>Thus, no changes in BFD and no new code-points are needed to run BFD
      over MPLS-TP LSPs. BFD supports continuous fault monitoring and thus
      meets the Continuity Check requirement specified in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements"></xref>. For point to
      multipoint Continuity Check, there is work in progress on using BFD for
      P2MP MPLS LSPs ( <xref target="I-D.katz-ward-bfd-multipoint"></xref>)
      and this can be leveraged for MPLS-TP LSPs as well.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Applicability">
      <t>The procedures described in this document apply to MPLS LSPs and as
      well as to LSPs based on the MPLS-TP profile. The LSP-Ping procedures
      can be used for performing OAM on both LSPs and Pseudowires.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The draft does not introduce any new security considerations. Those
      discussed in <xref target="RFC4379"></xref> are also applicable to this
      document.</t>
