    <abstract>
      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to
      provide a reference to the alternative ringback tone (RBT) for caller,
      or ring tone (RT) for callee using the Alert-Info header. However, the
      reference addresses only the network resources with specific rendering
      properties. There is currently no support for predefined standard
      identifiers for ringback tones or semantic indications without being
      tied to a particular rendering. To overcome this limitation and support
      new applications, a new family of URNs for use in SIP Alert-Info header
      fields is defined in this specification.</t>
    </abstract>

    <note title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>
      allows for user agent servers (UAS) and proxies to provide the specific
      ringback or ring tone to the user agent (UA). In RFC 3261 this is done
      by including a URI reference in the Alert-Info header field, that points
      to the tone. The URI reference is most commonly the HTTP URI to the
      audio file. On the receipt of the Alert-Info header the user agent may
      fetch the referenced ringback or ring tone and play it to the user.</t>

      <t>This mechanism does not ensure interoperability when there is no
      common understanding of the referenced content (different countries or
      vendors, hearing impaired) or when the user wants his own tones
      configured in the end device. If caller and callee are from the
      different countries, the understanding of the tones may vary
      significantly. Hearing impaired users may not sense the specific tone if
      it is provided as an audio file. The tone per se is also not useful for
      automata.</t>

      <t>There are currently interoperability issues around the use of the
      Alert-Info header field when not using an external ring file. For
      example, consider the PBX special ringtone for an external (to the PBX)
      caller. Different vendors use different approaches such as: Alert-Info:
      &lt;file://ring.pcm&gt;;alert=normal where ring.pcm is a dummy file or:
      Alert-Info: &lt;file://normal.ring.pcm&gt; or: Alert-Info:
      &lt;sip:normal-ringtone@example.com&gt; As a result, Alert-Info
      currently only works when the same vendor provides proxy and UA, as only
      then is the same "fake" proprietary URI convention used.</t>

      <t>Another limitation of the current solution is that the referenced
      tones are tied to particular rendering. It is not possible to provide a
      semantic indication that signals the intent and allows the recipient to
      decide how to render the received information in an appropriate way.</t>

      <t>To solve the described issues, this specification defines the new URN
      namespace 'alert' for the Alert-Info header that can be understood by an
      automaton, would allow for programmatic handling including user
      interface adaptation, or conversion to equivalent protocol parameters in
      the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) when the client is a
      gateway. The work to standardize an Alert-Info URN will increase SIP
      interoperability for this header field by replacing proprietary
      conventions.</t>

      <t>Using 'alert' namespace provides syntax for several different
      application spaces:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Names for services such as call waiting or automatic callback,
          not tied to any particular rendering.</t>

          <t>Names for common ring-tones generated by PBX phones for cases
          such as an internal enterprise caller, external caller, ringback
          after a transfer failure or expiration of a hold timer, etc.</t>

          <t>Names for country-specific ringback tones.</t>

          <t>Names for things with specific renderings that aren't purely
          audio. They might be static icons, video sequences, text, etc.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Some advantages of a URN rather than a URI reference to a
      downloadable resource:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Do not need to download it or deal with security issues
          associated with dereferencing.</t>

          <t>No formatting or compatibility issues.</t>

          <t>No security risk of rendering something unexpected and
          undesirable.</t>

          <t>The tone can be stored locally in whatever format and at whatever
          quality level is appropriate, because it is specified "by name"
          rather than "by value".</t>

          <t>It is easier to make policy decisions about whether to use it or
          not.</t>

          <t>It facilitates translation for the hearing impaired.</t>
        </list>The downside is that if the recipient does not understand the
      URN then it will only be able to render a default ringback or ring-tone.
      To provide the general awareness about the Alert-Info URNs this document
      provides IANA template for registering the URNs and defines several
      typical identifiers.</t>

      <t>This specification does not change the usage of the SIP
      Alert-Info-header defined in the RFC3261. The Alert-Info-header can be
      used in INVITE requests and 180 Ringing responses.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements">
      <t>This section discusses the requirements for an identifier to
      transport the semantic of a specific ring or ringback tone.</t>

      <t>REQ-1: The mechanism will allow user agents (UAs) and proxies to
      provide a semantic indication in the Alert-Info SIP-header that signals
      the intent of the rendering and allows the recipient to decide how to
      render the received information.</t>

      <t>REQ-2: The mechanism will allow interoperability for services as call
      waiting, forward, call forwarding, transfer-recall, auto-callback,
      hold-recall, crisis.</t>

      <t>REQ-3: The mechanism will allow rendering common PBX ring tone
      types.</t>

      <t>REQ-4: The mechanism will allow rendering specific country ringback
      tones.</t>

      <t>REQ-5: The mechanism will allow rendering tones for emergency
      alerts.</t>

      <t>REQ-6: The mechanism will allow rendering using other means than
      tones, e.g. text or images.</t>

      <t>REQ-7: The mechanism will allow rendering to be semantic, not biased
      towards a particular representation which might not be suitable for all
      devices or users. The Alert-Info URN must be semantic whenever the
      semantic is known to the sender.</t>

      <t>REQ-8: The mechanism will allow non-semantic, rendering-oriented
      Alert-Info URNs when the semantic of the rendering is not known by the
      sender and the sender can assume that there is a good chance that for
      the receiver to know how to render the non-semantic URN. This is the
      case, e.g. for:</t>

      <t>- ringing tones used in closed in enterprise networks</t>

      <t>- ringing tones used in some countries</t>

      <t>- when TDM gateways must map ring-/ringback-tones from legacy
      protocols to SIP at the edge of a network .</t>

      <t>REQ-9: The mechanism must ensure that an UA receiving Alert-Info URNs
      or portions of an Alert-Info URN it does not understand, it can ignore
      them.</t>

      <t>REQ-10: The mechanism will allow storage of the actual encoding
      locally rather than fetching it.</t>

      <t>REQ-11: The mechanism will allow the identifier to be specified "by
      name" rather than "by value", to enable local policy decisions whether
      to use it or not.</t>

      <t>REQ-12: The mechanism will allow transmission in the Alert-Info
      header of SIP INVITE requests and 180 Ringing responses.</t>

      <t>REQ-13: The mechanism will be flexible, so new identifiers can be
      defined in the future, when SIP-applications evolve. E.g. Alert-Info
      URNs could identify specific media by name, such as "Beethoven's Fifth",
      and the end device could render some small part of it as a ring
      tone.</t>

          <t>The Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the "alert" URNs is
          called alert-identifier and has a hierarchical structure. The
          left-most label is called "alert-category" and is separated from
          right-side of the alert-identifier, the alert-indication, by a
          semicolon. In this specification, three categories of
          alert-identifiers are described: the "tone" alert-identifiers, the
          "ringback" alert-identifiers and the "service"
          alert-identifiers.</t>

          <t style="hanging">The "tone" alert-identifier has the general
          form:</t>

          <list>
            <t>urn:alert:tone:{tone-indication}</t>
          </list>

          <t>where the tone-indication identifies the semantic or rendering
          characteristics of a ring tone. Alert-Info URNs containing the
          "tone" alert-identifier can be used in INVITE requests, but not in
          180 Ringing responses.</t>

          <t />

          <t style="hanging">The "ringback" alert-identifier has the general
          form:</t>

          <list>
            <t>urn:alert:ringback:{ringback-indication}</t>
          </list>

          <t>where the ringback-indication is a unique identifier for a
          country-specific ringback tone. Alert-Info URNs containing the
          "ringback" alert-identifier can be used in 180 Ringing responses,
          but not in INVITE requests.</t>

          <t />

          <t style="hanging">The "service" alert-identifier has the general
          form:</t>

          <list>
            <t>urn:alert:service:{service-indication}</t>
          </list>

          <t>where the service-indication is a unique identifier for a service
          as call-waiting or transfer-recall. Alert-Info URNs containing the
          "service" alert-identifier can be used in both INVITE requests and
          180 Ringing responses.</t>

          <t>The tone-indication, the ringback-indication and the
          service-indication are hierarchical identifiers, consisting of one
          label or a sequence of labels separated by periods. The left-most
          label is the most significant one and is called 'top-level
          indication' , while names to the right are called 'sub-indication'.
          The set of allowable characters is the same as that for domain names
          <xref target="RFC1123" />. Labels are case-insensitive, but MUST be
          specified in all lower-case.</t>

          <t>Labels can be removed right-to-left excepting the left-most
          label; the resulting tone-indication or service-indication is still
          valid, referring to a more generic tone-indication,
          ringback-indication or service-indication. In other words, if a tone
          'x.y.z' exists, the tones 'x' and 'x.y' are also valid tones. Each
          alert indication identifier SHALL explicitly define it's validity
          respective the sub-indications.</t>

          <t hangText="Community considerations:">The alert URN is believed to
          be relevant to a large cross-section of Internet users, including
          both technical and non-technical users, on a variety of devices and
          with a variety of perception capabilities. The 'alert' URN will
          allow Internet users to receive more information and enable them to
          better make decisions about accepting an offered call, or get better
          feedback on the progress of a call they have made. User interfaces
          for the perception impaired users can better render the ringback
          indication based on the 'alert' URN. The assignment of identifiers
          is described in <xref target="IANA" />. The 'alert' URN does not
          prescribe a particular resolution mechanism, but it is assumed that
          a number of different entities could operate and offer such
          mechanisms.</t>

          identifies a logical service or tone, specified in the 'alert'
          indication registration (see <xref target="IANA" />). Resolution of

          identifier. Alert identifier URNs MUST be unique for each unique
          indication; this is guaranteed through the registration of each
          alert indication within this namespace, described in <xref
          target="IANA" />.</t>

          <t hangText="Identifier persistence considerations:">The 'alert' URN

      <section anchor="PBX_Tones" title="PBX Tones">
        <t>This section defines some commonly encountered ring-tones on PBX or

        <section title="normal">
          <t>This tone indicates that the default or normal ring-tone should
          be rendered. This is essentially a no-operation Alert-Info URN and
          should be treated by the UA as if no Alert-Info URN is present. This
          is most useful when Alert-Info header field parameters are being
          used. For example, in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances"></xref>, an Alert-Info
          header field needs to be present containing the "appearance"
          parameter, but no special ringtone need be specified. If no special
          alerting is to be used, urn:alert:tone:normal should be used.</t>

        <section title="external">

        <section title="call-waiting">
          <t>The call waiting Service <xref target="TS24.615"></xref> permits
          a callee to be notified of an incoming call whilst the media
          resources are not available for the incoming call and the callee is
          engaged in an active or held call. Subsequently, the callee can
          either accept, reject, or ignore the incoming call. There is an
          interest on the caller side to be informed about the call waiting
          situation on the callee side. Having this information the caller can
          decide whether to continue waiting for callee to pickup or better to
          call some time later when it is estimated that the callee could have
          finished the ongoing conversation. To provide this information, the
          callee's UAS or proxy aware of the call waiting condition can add
          the call-waiting indication URN to the Alert-Info header. As
          call-waiting information may be subject to the callee's privacy
          concerns, the exposure of this information SHALL be done only if
          explicitly required by the user. The urn:alert:service:call-waiting
          should be used for this case.</t>

        <section title="forward">
          <t>This feature is used in a 180-Ringing response when a call
          forwarding feature has been initiated on an INVITE. Many PBX system
          implement a forwarding "beep" followed by normal ringing to indicate
          this. The urn:alert:service:forward should be used for this case.
          Note that a 181 response can be used in place of this URN.</t>

          the transferor and fails. Instead of failing the call, the server
          calls back the transferor, giving them another chance to transfer or
          otherwise deal with the call. This service tone is used to
          distinguish this INVITE from any other normal incoming call. The
          urn:alert:service:transfer-recall should be used for this case.</t>

        <section title="auto-callback">
          <t>This feature is used when a user has utilized a server to
          implement an automatic callback service. When the user is available,
          the server calls back the user and utilizes this service tone to
          distinguish this from any other normal incoming call. The

        <section title="hold-recall">
          <t>This feature is used when a server implements a call hold timer

          hold, the user who placed the call on hold is alerted to either
          retrieve the call or otherwise dispose of the call. This service
          tone is used to distinguish this case from any other normal incoming
          call. The urn:alert:service:hold-recall should be used for this

        <section title="zip">
          <t>This sub-level is used to indicate that the alert type specified

          sometimes referred to as "abbreviated ringing" or a "zip tone". For
          example, urn:alert:tone:zip would generate a shorter than normal
          ring-tone.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="delayed">
          <t>This sub-level is used to indicate that the alerting type
          specified show be rendered after a short delay. In some bridged
          line/shared line appearance implementations, this is used so that
          the bridged line does not ring at exactly the same time as the main
          line, but is delayed a few seconds. For example,
          urn:alert:tone:delayed would generate a normal ring-tone, delayed by
          a few seconds.</t>

        <t>The ISO 3166-1 country code <xref target="ISO 3166-1"></xref> is
        used as a top-level indication to infor the UAC about the
        country-specific tone which should be rendered to the caller. For
        example, to indicate ringback tones from South Africa, the following
        URN would be used: &lt;urn:alert:ringback:za&gt;.</t>

      <section title="Combinations of URNs">
        <t>In some cases, more than one URN will need to be specified to fully

        example, an internal, priority call could be indicated by Alert-Info:
        &lt;urn:alert:tone:internal&gt;, &lt;urn:alert:tone:priority&gt;. A
        priority call waiting tone could be indicated by Alert-Info:

    <section title="User Agent Behavior">
      <t>Upon receiving a SIP INVITE request or a SIP 180-Ringing response
      with an Alert-Info header that contains a single or multiple 'alert'
      URNs, the User Agent (UA) attempts to match the received Alert-Info URNs
      with the known indications or indication combinations. The User Agent
      (UA) ignores the Alert-Info URNs for which no match is found and
      proceeds with the normal operation. If one or multiple URNs match(es) a
      known indication or a known indication combination, the User Agent (UA)
      renders the indication or the indication combination to the user
      accordingly. The User Agent (UA) is responsible for the non disturbing
      rendering if multiple indications and network resources are to be
      rendered simultaneously.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Proxy Behavior">
      <t></t>

      <t>A SIP proxy MAY add a URN or multiple URNs to the Alert-Info header
      in a SIP request or a 180 Ringing provisional response when it needs to
      provide additional information about the call or about the provided
      service. A SIP Proxy SHOULD NOT add a mixture of 'alert' URNs and URIs
      to the Alert-Info header that may cause disturbing rendering
      interference at the recipient's User Agent (UA).</t>

      <t>Following example shows both the network audio resource referenced by
      the HTTP URI and the URN indication for the call-waiting service

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This section registers a new URN scheme with the registration
      template provided in section Registration Template.</t>

      <t>Below, the section 7.1 details how to register new alert-identifiers.
      Descriptions of alert-indications for the first three alert-identifiers
      described in this document , 'service', 'tone' and 'ringback', are given
      in Section 7.2 and Section 7.3, respectively. Finally, Section 7.4
      contains the initial registration table.</t>

      <section title="New alert-identifiers">
        <t>Alert URNs are identified by labels managed by IANA, according to
        the processes outlined in <xref target="RFC5226"></xref> in a new
        registry called "Alert URN Labels". Thus, creating a new
        alert-identifier requires IANA action. The policy for adding a new
        alert-identifier category is 'Standards Action'. (This document
        defines the alert-identifier categories 'service' , 'tone' and
        'ringback'.) The policy for assigning labels to alert top-level
        indications or sub-indications and the rules to combine top-level
        indications and sub-indications may differ for each alert-identifier
        category and MUST be defined by the document describing the
        corresponding alert indications. The entries in the registration table
        have the following format:</t>

        <t>This section defines the alert-identifier registration within the
        IANA registry defined in Section 7.1, using the alert-category labels
        'service', 'tone' and 'ringback'.</t>

        <t>The 'tone' alert-category label provides information about ringing
        tones rendered by a UAS to the callee. The 'tone' alert-category label
        may be generated by a UAC or a proxy and transmitted in a INVITE
        request to the UAS.</t>

        <t>The &lsquo;ringback&rsquo; alert-category label provides
        information about ringback tone rendered by a UAC to the caller. The
        'ringback' alert-category label may be generated by a UAS or a proxy
        and transmitted in a 180 Ringing response.</t>

        <t>The 'service' alert-category label describes special tones rendered
        by a UAC or the UAS to the caller or the callee. The 'service'
        alert-category label may be generated by a UAC, a UAS or a proxy and
        transmitted in a INVITE request or a 180 Ringing response.</t>

        <t>The normal rendering is audio, however there can be other

          <t>Senders may insert one or more Alert-Info URNs. Following rules
          apply:</t>

          <t>- Senders should not insert two different URNs from one of the
          groups described above.</t>

          <t>- Any indication for PBX-tones can be combined with any
          additional indication for PBX-tones.</t>

          <t>- Indications and additional indications for PBX-tones can not be
          combined with indication for country specific ringback (they are
          sent in diferent messages).</t>

          <t>-Indications and additional indications for PBX-tones as well as
          indication for country specific ringback can be combind with
          indications for services which can be sent in the same SIP message
          (INVITE or 180 Ringing).</t>

          <t>- For stand-alone additional indication for PBX-tones, the
          receiver should assume the "normal" indication for PBX-tones.</t>

          <t>UAs may have rules how to render specific combinations of
          Alert-Info URNs. An UA receiving a combination of Alert-Info URN
          which it does not know how to render, it may choose to render a
          subset of it or to ignore the content of the Alert-Info URN
          Header.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Internationalization Considerations ">
      <t>The alert-identifier labels are protocol elements <xref
      target="RFC3536"></xref> and are not normally seen by users. Thus, the
      character set for these elements is restricted, as described in Section
      6.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>As an identifier, the alert URN does not appear to raise any
      particular security issues. The indications described by the 'alert' URN
      are meant to be well-known, so privacy considerations do not apply to
      the URN.</t>

      <t>Provision of the specific indications from callee to caller may raise
      privacy issues. Such provision SHALL always be explicitly authorised by
      the callee.</t>
