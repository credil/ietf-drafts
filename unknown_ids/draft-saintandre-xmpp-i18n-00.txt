                  Internationalized Addresses in XMPP
                     draft-saintandre-xmpp-i18n-00

Abstract

   XMPP as defined in RFC 3920 uses stringprep in the preparation and
   comparison of non-ASCII characters within JabberIDs.  This document
   explores whether it makes sense to use stringprep in the document
   that supersedes RFC 3920.

Internet-Draft                  XMPP I18N                     March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol as defined in [XMPP]
   uses stringprep [STRINGPREP] in the preparation and comparison of
   non-ASCII characters within JabberIDs (JIDs).  XMPP addresses are of
   the form <localpart@domainpart/resourcepart>, where the localpart and
   resourcepart are optional but quite common.  RFC 3920 did the
   following: (1) specified the use of IDNA2003 [IDNA] and Nameprep
   [NAMEPREP] for the domainpart of a JID, (2) defined the Nodeprep
   profile of stringprep for the localpart of a JID, and (3) defined the
   Resourceprep profile of stringprep for the resourecepart of a JID.
   The change from stringprep in IDNA2003 to an inclusion approach to
   internationalized addresses in IDNA2008 (see for example [RATIONALE])
   raises the question whether it makes sense for XMPP to also change
   its approach to the preparation and comparison of non-ASCII
   characters in the localpart and resourcepart aspects of a JID.
   Therefore this document explores the issue of internationalized
   addresses in XMPP as input to the revisions captured more formally in
   [XMPPBIS].


2.  Background

   The inclusion approach in IDNA2008 makes sense because domain names
   were always limited to the letter-digits-hyphen ("LDH") pattern; the
   progression to non-ASCII simply introduced more characters that might
   qualify as letters and (in some cases) digits.  Extrapolating from
   that pattern, [RATIONALE] argues that there is no good reason for a
   domain name to include characters such as symbols (e.g., hearts and
   stars), since the purpose of a domain name is to provide a stable
   identifier for communication and interaction over the Internet, not a
   personally expressive name for a person or a fun tag for information.

   The localpart and resourcepart of a JID might serve a different kind
   of purpose.  Many end users of XMPP-based instant messaging (IM)
   systems might expect that the username (localpart) portion of a JID
   could be expressive of their identity in some way.  Similarly,
   occupants of XMPP-based chatrooms might expect that their in-room
   nickname (resourcepart) could be a fun conversation-starter, perhaps
   even more so than a normal username; for example, a regular visitor
   to an XMPP chatroom that I frequent has an in-room nickname of "The
   King" where "King" is represented by the Unicode codepoint 'BLACK
   CHESS KING' (U+265A).  Such characters might difficult to communicate
   in some contexts (e.g., in screen readers for the blind), but are
   expressive and fun, which is not an unimportant consideration for
   many IM users.

   Does the desire for an expressive username or nickname trump the need

   for human-readable identifiers?  Given the wide implementation of
   full-Unicode addresses in user-oriented XMPP applications, IM client
   developers seem to think so.

   These admittedly anecdotal and subjective considerations vaguely
   indicate that the inclusion approach pursued in the IDNA2008
   initiative is quite appropriate for the more restricted class of
   domain names but perhaps not as appropriate for the localpart or
   resourcepart of an XMPP address.

   That being said, some XMPP implementations (e.g., a custom client) or
   deployments (e.g., a military system) might wish to "lock down" the
   expressive potential of XMPP addresses.  Currently there is no way
   for an implementation or deployment to do so in standardized manner
   that can be communicated to other entities on the network (e.g.,
   during account provisioning).  Given that a deployed XMPP service
   acts in some ways like a registrar does for domain names, such
   methods might be helpful, even if out of scope for [XMPPBIS].


3.  Recommendations

   This document does not yet provide definitive recommendations, but
   instead mainly seeks to foster discussion about internationalized
   addresses in XMPP.  However, there are three possible approaches that
   the XMPP WG might pursue in relation to its existing stringprep
   profiles:

   1.  Keep using Nameprep, Nodeprep, and/or Resourceprep as they are
       defined today.
   2.  Collaborate with other interested parties or working groups to
       define a new version of stringprep that tracks changes to Unicode
       since Unicode 3.2 as currently specified in [STRINGPREP].
   3.  Pursue the general model followed in the IDNA2008 work by
       defining a tiered model of valid, disallowed, and unassigned
       characters; such an effort might be pursued only within the XMPP
       community (for Nodeprep, Resourceprep, or both) or more generally
       in concert with other users of stringprep.

   The XMPP WG might even decide to use a mix of these approaches, e.g.
   to use the new, non-stringprep IDNA2008 approach for domainparts but
   the existing Nodeprep and Resourceprep profiles for localparts and
   resourceparts.

3.1.  Domainpart

   RFC 3920 specifies the use of IDNA2003 for the domainpart of a JID.
   This document does not question the reasoning behind the IDNA2008

   work and therefore recommends the use of IDNA2008 technologies in
   [XMPPBIS].

3.2.  Localpart

   This document does not yet provide a recommendation regarding the
   localpart of a JID (e.g., whether to replace or update the Nodeprep
   profile of stringprep).

3.3.  Resourcepart

   This document does not yet provide a recommendation regarding the
   resourcepart of a JID (e.g., whether to replace or update the
   Resourceprep profile of stringprep).


4.  Security Considerations

   The inclusion of non-ASCII characters in XMPP addresses has important
   security implications, such as the ability to mimic characters or
   entire addresses.  These issues are explored at some length in
   [MIMIC].  Other security considerations might apply and will be
   described in a future version of this specification.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for the IANA.
