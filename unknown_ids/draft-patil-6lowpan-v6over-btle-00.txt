         Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Bluetooth Low Energy
                   draft-patil-6lowpan-v6over-btle-00

Abstract

   Bluetooth low energy is a low power air interface technology that is
   defined by the bluetooth SIG.  The standard bluetooth radio has been
   widely implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook
   computers, audio headsets and many other devices.  The low power
   version of bluetooth is a new specification and enables the use of
   this air interface with devices such as sensors, smart meters,
   applicances, etc.  There is an added value in the ability to
   communicate with sensors over IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6
   is transported over bluetooth low energy using 6LoWPAN techniques.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over BT-LE                  March 2011


1.  Introduction

   Bluetooth Low Energy (BT-LE) is a radio technology targeted for
   devices that operate with coin cell batteries, which means that low
   power consumption is essential.  BT-LE can also be integrated into
   existing Bluetooth (BT) devices so that devices such as mobile phones
   and PCs can operate with existing BT accessories as well as BT-LE
   accessories.  An example of a use case for BT-LE accessory is a heart
   rate monitor that sends data via the mobile phone to a server on the
   Internet.  BT-LE is designed for transferring small amount of data
   (in most cases less than 10bytes) less frequently (e.g. every 500ms)
   at modest data rates (e.g. 300kbps).  BT-LE enables low cost sensors
   to send their data over the Internet via a gateway such as a mobile
   phone.  BT-LE is especially attractive technology for Internet of
   Things applications, such as health monitors, environmental sensing
   and proximity applications.

   Considering the expected explosion in the number of sensors, IPv6 is
   an ideal protocol due to the large address space it provides.  This
   document describes how IPv6 is used on Bluetooth Low Energy links in
   a power efficient manner along with efficient application protocols
   that enable the integration of BT-LE devices into services.

   [RFC4944] specifies the transmission of IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4.  The
   bluetooth low energy link in many respects has similar
   characteristics to that of IEEE 802.15.4.  Many of the mechanisms
   defined in [RFC4944] can be applied to the transmission of IPv6 on
   bluetooth low energy links.  This document specifies the details of
   IPv6 transmission over blue-tooth low energy links.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack

   The Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP) has been
   developed for encapsulating any network protocol for Bluetooth
   Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol(L2CAP).  BNEP assumes
   that L2CAP supports connection oriented channel.  A connection
   oriented channel needs to be added to the current BT-LE
   specification, over which BNEP, parts of 6LoWPAN, IPv6 and
   application protocols can be run.  Figure 1 illustrates IPv6 over
   BT-LE stack.

   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is an application protocol
   specifically designed for resource constrained environments.  CoAP
   could be run on top of IPv6 supporting requests from the server and
   requests of cached replies from a CoAP/HTTP proxy in the BT-LE
   gateway.

   BT-LE technology sets limitations to protocol overhead such as header
   sizes.

3.  IPv6 profile for BT-LE

3.1.  Base specifications

   A BT-LE needs to support following specifications in order to support
   IPv6:

      1.  Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks
      [RFC4994]

      2.  Compression Format for IPv6 Datagrams in Low Power and Lossy
      Networks (6LoWPAN) [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc]

      3.  Neighbor Discovery Optimization for Low-power and Lossy
      Networks [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc]

3.2.  BT-LE specific properties

3.2.1.  Header Compression

   In BT-LE link with header compression IPv6 header (originally 40
   Bytes) can be compressed to only 2 Bytes with link-local addresses

   and 26 Bytes with Global addresses.  UDP header (originally 8 Bytes)
   can be compressed to 4 Bytes.


4.  Additional contributors

   Kanji Kerai and Jari Mutikainen from Nokia have contributed
   significantly to this document.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not have any IANA requests at this time.  This may
   change with further development of the specification.


6.  Security Considerations

   The transmission of IPv6 over bluetooth low energy links has similar
   requirements and concerns for security as zigbee.  Security at the IP
   layer needs to be reviewed as part of the development of the IPv6
   over bluetooth low energy specification.
