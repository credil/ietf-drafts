1. Introduction 
    
   In many deployed SIP Service Provider (SSP) architectures, it is 
   common to use REGISTER requests to provide the reachability 
   information for IP-PBXs, instead of DNS-based resolution and 
   routing.  An IETF-defined mechanism for doing so is being worked on 
   in the Martini Working Group, in [draft-gin].   
    
   The current Martini mechanism only supports E.164-based AoR's, 
   however in actual deployments private-extension or "local" numbers 
   are used for hosted and carrier-provided intra-Enterprise calling

   services, and domain-scoped "email-style" URIs may become more 
   popular in the near future.  Neither of these forms of AoRs are 
   supported by the current Martini mechanism.  This document defines a 
   means by which they can be supported, in a manner consistent with 
   [RFC3261] and [draft-gin]. 
 
2. Definitions 
    
   For brevity's sake, this document uses the word "request" instead of 
   "out-of-dialog request", but in all case means out-of-dialog 
   request. 
 
   AoR: address-of-record, as defined by RFC 3261: a URI by which the 
   user is canonically known (e.g., on their business cards, in the 
   From header field of their requests, in the To header field of 
   REGISTER requests, etc.). 
    
   Local-Number: an AoR which follows the form of local-number in 
   [RFC3966], but may be encoded in a SIP or TEL URI.  The local-number 
   contains a 'phone-context' parameter identifying the scope of its 
   number. 
    
   Email-style URI: a SIP AoR which does not identify a global E.164 
   number or local-number. 
    
   Implicit Registration: implicitly providing the reachability 
   information for something other than the AoR explicitly indicated in 
   the Register transaction. 
    
   Reachability Information: a set of URI's identifying the host and 
   path of Proxies to reach that host; like any URI, these URI's may 
   identify the specific connection transport, IP Address, and port 
   information, or they may only identify FQDN's. 
    
   SSP: SIP Service Provider, as defined by [RFC5486]. 
    
3. Background on Current Martini Mechanism 
    
   The current Martini mechanism, defined in [draft-gin], allows a SIP 
   UA such as an IP-PBX to Register a set of E.164 AoRs in "bulk".  
   Instead of creating a separate REGISTER transaction for every E.164 
   AoR, the IP-PBX sends one REGISTER request with a 'bnc' Contact URI 
   parameter which indicates the Contact URI needs to be expanded in 
   the Registrar's location service database.  The expansion is such 
   that each E.164 user number becomes the user portion of the 
   Registered Contact URI, one for each implicitly Registered E.164 
   AoR.

Internet-Draft          SIP MARTINI with OLIVE              April 2010 
 
 
   SIP Request routing to the Registered E.164 AoR then follows normal 
   [RFC3261] procedures, replacing the Request URI with the (expanded) 
   Registered Contact URI, and adding any Path information as a Route 
   set, etc. 
    
3.1. Why non-E.164 AoRs may need processing by SSPs 
    
   There is some debate about how a non-E.164 AoR could even be 
   received by the SSP for processing to begin with.  This section 
   describes how such could be the case. 
    
   It should be noted that this document only deals with SIP AoRs of 
   the same URI domain name as that of the REGISTER's To URI - namely 
   the SSP's domain. 
    
   A SIP Request targeted to a Local-number AoR could require 
   processing by the SSP because: 
      - The SSP provides IP-Centrex type services for some of the AoRs 
        of an Enterprise, for example for small branches, while 
        providing SIP-Trunk service to the main IP-PBX(s).  Requests 
        from the IP-Centrex UAs will thus be targeted to Local-numbers 
        as they are received by the SSP Proxy on their way to the IP-
        PBX. 
      - The SSP provides inbound extension dialing, for example by 
        offering private calling-card services, such that a E.164 
        number call is terminated by an Application Server of the SSP 
        which authenticates the caller belongs to an Enterprise and 
        then allows private extension dialing, as a UAC, thereby 
        originating a new SIP session Request using a Local-Number 
        target AoR. 
    
   A SIP Request targeted to an Email-style AoR could require 
   processing by an SSP because: 
      - The SSP provides Email-style AoRs for business customers - for 
        example "sip:bob@ssp.example.net". 
      - The SSP has a sub-division or sub-entity which uses IP-PBX 
        Martini trunks into the SSP main domain, for which the SSP 
        provides AoRs of the main SSP domain - for example, a sales 
        division IP-PBX in a sub-domain of sales.ssp.example.net, but 
        for which the SSP provides an AoR of 
        "sip:sales@ssp.example.net". 
      - The Email-style AoR is scoped to the Enterprise's domain, but 
        the Request originated from within the SSP - for example by one 
        of its subscriber SIP UAs.  Since SIP UAs generally send their 
        Requests through their SSP's proxies, the Request will be 
        processed by them first.  This type of AoR (i.e., one scoped 
        outside of the SSP's domain) is NOT in scope for this document.

Internet-Draft          SIP MARTINI with OLIVE              April 2010 
 
 
   There are other possibilities as well, of course, but this section 
   is only intended to provide some basic rational for why it is 
   possible for a local-number or email-style AoR to be used and appear 
   in the SSP. 
    
3.2. The issues with non-E.164 Identifiers 
    
   At the initial outset of Martini's work, the problem space to work 
   on was narrowed to E.164 numbers only, for several reasons.  This 
   section attempts to identify the reasons in detail, and address 
   them. 
    
3.2.1     Globally unique AoR 
    
   One of the initial benefits cited for only supporting E.164 is that 
   an E.164 user name is globally unique by itself, and thus changing 
   the host portion of the Request-URI does not impact the identity of 
   the intended target of the Request. 
    
   Fortunately, [draft-gin] does not in fact rely on that property of 
   the AoR username.  What [draft-gin] does is emulate what would have 
   happened had the IP-PBX Registered each E.164 AoR separately.  It is 
   not in fact Registering an "E.164 number" - it is Registering 
   typical [RFC3261] AoRs, which just happen to be formatted as E.164 
   numbers.  For example, the IP-PBX is not implicitly Registering the 
   identity of "+12125551212", it is instead implicitly Registering for 
   the SIP AoR of "sip:+12125551212@ssp.example.net".  The SSP may well 
   associate and route requests for "tel:+12125551212" to that AoR's 
   Registered contact, but in so doing it can be described as logically 
   performing a transformation of the TEL URI to a SIP URI and looking 
   up that SIP URI in its location service database. 
    
   Interestingly, the AoR that was implicitly Registered is globally 
   unique, *regardless* of the fact that the user portion happens to be 
   an E.164 number.  It is globally unique, because the AoR is of the 
   domain "ssp.example.net" - just as any [RFC3261] SIP AoR is globally 
   unique due to its host domain portion. 
    
3.2.2     Registered Contact Username 
    
   The other rational for needing a globally unique identifier is the 
   Registered Contact URI.  Because the Martini model performs a bulk 
   Registration and uses a defined expansion rule for how to expand the 
   Registered Contact into a unique Contact URI per AoR, the rule's 
   output needs to be unambiguous and generate a unique Contact per 
   AoR.  For example, if the IP-PBX has multiple SSPs it Registers 
   into, it can't just receive a request to 
   "sip:bob@pbx.enterprise.com", because it won't know if that's to

Internet-Draft          SIP MARTINI with OLIVE              April 2010 
 
 
   "sip:bob@ssp1.example.net" or "sip:bob@ssp2.example.net", which may 
   be different users. 
    
   This is a real problem, but what it requires/needs is a globally 
   unique Contact URI, not a globally unique AoR user name.  In fact, 
   [draft-gin] suffers from this problem as well, in some ways.  
   Although it is unambiguous what the target of the request may be 
   (because the username is globally unique), it still may be important 
   for the IP-PBX to know which implicitly Registered AoR the request 
   was resolved from, before being sent to it.  For example, the IP-PBX 
   may want to know the request is for 
   "sip:+12125551212@ssp.example.net.uk" vs. 
   "sip:+12125551212@ssp.example.net.fr".  The IP-PBX *would* have 
   Registered separately for each domain, but if its contact is the 
   same (and if it went through the same path, etc.), there would be no 
   unique identifier for inbound Requests. 
    
   This problem could be solved numerous ways.  For one, this is a 
   similar issue to that solved by [RFC4244] or being worked on in 
   [draft-4244bis].  Secondly, and more importantly, the IP-PBX could 
   simply make the Contact unique by inserting a parameter in the 
   Contact URI it Registers, or inserting a Path header field with 
   unique information per Register target domain. 
    
   Regardless of the solution, it is solvable without impacting the 
   user portion of the AoR being implicitly Registered.  Therefore, 
   there is no need to make the username portion globally unique, and 
   thus once again there is no need for [draft-gin] to only be used for 
   E.164 AoRs. 
    
3.2.3     Avoiding syntax mismatches 
    
   Another issue with the Contact bulk-expansion rule and implicitly 
   Registering Contact URIs is guaranteeing the Registrar uses a 
   username the IP-PBX will accept/expect.  In particular, there are 
   numerous syntactic forms a phone number can take in the user portion 
   of a SIP URI, for example with or without a leading "+", or with 
   visual-separators or not.  Since the IP-PBX is not actually 
   Registering an explicit Contact URI user portion for each AoR, there 
   needs to be an assurance that the format of the expanded-to user 
   portion matches what it expects.   
    
   For Email-style URIs, this is actually quite straight-forward, 
   because there is only one form the user name can take: if the AoR is 
   "sip:bob@ssp.example.net", then a simple AoR-user-based expansion 
   rule would suffice because "bob" can only have one form. (e.g., even 
   case-sensitivity matters)  Thus there is no syntax mismatch concern 
   for generic string names.

Internet-Draft          SIP MARTINI with OLIVE              April 2010 
 
 
   Local-Numbers in TEL URIs, or SIP URIs formed from TEL URIs, are 
   more difficult, however.  Like E.164 (i.e., global-number) formats, 
   they are not as well constrained.  They may have visual-separators, 
   for example, and if their phone-context parameter value is a global-
   number, it too has the same formatting "looseness" of E.164 number 
   user names.   
    
   To make matters worse, Local-Numbers are frequently NOT within the 
   scope of the SSP, or at least the SSP does not always have full 
   knowledge of all Local-Numbers it can route requests for. 
    
   This document will address this Local-Number issue, but for the case 
   of Local-Numbers scoped to the SSP's domain only.  Local-Numbers 
   scoped to a phone-context that is an E.164 or not the same domain 
   name as the REGISTER transaction's explicit AoR are outside the 
   scope of this document.  
    
   This also remains an open issue for discussion, as discussed in 
   section 8. 
    
4. The Solution - an Overview 
    
   The general concept proposed in this document is to simply apply 
   [draft-gin] for any set of AoRs of the Registered-to domain, for any 
   valid set of user strings as defined in [RFC3261].  The [draft-gin] 
   REGISTER request would cause the Registrar to populate the set of 
   AoRs to Contact bindings, as it did before.   
    
   The Contact URI user portion would also be "expanded", using the 
   same user portion as that of the implicitly Registered AoRs.  In the 
   case of a Local-Number, for the specific scopes described later, the 
   username is "normalized" in the same manner as [draft-gin]. 
    
   Note that the list of AoRs associated with a PBX is a matter of 
   local provisioning at the SSP and at the PBX, as it was in [draft-
   gin].  The mechanism defined in this document does not provide any 
   means to detect or recover from provisioning mismatches (although 
   the registration event package can be used as a standardized means 
   for auditing such AoRs). 
    
   No new option-tag is required, because this document's mechanism 
   does not require any changes in Martini [draft-gin] Registration or 
   subsequent [RFC3261] routing behavior in the IP-PBX or any proxies 
   along the path.  The routing follows the [RFC3261] Registered AoR-
   contact resolution model, which is a basic function of SIP. 
    
   The only SIP devices affected by this document's mechanism is the 
   SSP's Registrar, which needs to update the appropriate AoR entries, 
   and any proxy/ies of the SSP which perform route resolution by 
 
 
Kaplan                  Expires - October 2009                [Page 7] 
Internet-Draft          SIP MARTINI with OLIVE              April 2010 
 
 
   looking up the contents of the (logical) location-service database.  
   Since such proxies may not even be in the path of the REGISTER 
   request, an option-tag will not help.  And since the Registrar and 
   Proxies in question are all under control of the same administrative 
   entity (the SSP), it is reasonable to expect them all to support 
   this document's mechanism, if any do. 
    
    
5. Registering for AoRs 
    
   This document's mechanism relies on the Martini [draft-gin] 
   Registration mechanism.  The IP-PBX Registers into the SSP, using a 
   REGISTER request with the [draft-gin] option-tag in the Require and 
   Proxy-Require header fields, and a Contact URI containing the 
   [draft-gin] "bnc" URI parameter and no user portion.  After the PBX 
   is authenticated, the registrar updates its location service so that 
   each of the AoRs associated with the PBX creates a unique AOR to 
   Contact mapping.  Semantically, each of these mappings will be 
   treated as a unique row in the location service.  The actual 
   implementation may, of course, perform internal optimizations to 
   reduce the amount of memory used to store such information. 
    
   For each of these unique rows, the AOR will be in the format that 
   the SSP expects to receive from external parties (e.g. 
   "sip:bob@ssp.example.com"), and the corresponding Contact will be 
   formed adding a user portion to the REGISTER's Contact URI 
   containing the AoR user name and removing the "bnc" parameter.  For 
   example, if the "Contact" header field contains the URI 
   <sip:198.51.100.3:5060;foo=bar;bnc>, then the Contact value 
   associated with the aforementioned AOR will be 
   <sip:bob@198.51.100.3:5060;foo=bar>. 
    
   Local-Numbers have slightly different Contact URI expansion rules, 
   as defined later. 
    
   As in [draft-gin], aside from the "bnc" parameter, all URI 
   parameters present in the "Contact" URI in the REGISTER message MUST 
   be copied to the Contact value stored in the location service. 
    
   Note that the location service database, and any entry model 
   described here, is purely an abstract concept used by [RFC3261], 
   [draft-gin], and this document; an actual implementation may do 
   whatever it likes internally, so long as the external behavior 
   follows the model.  For example, if an SSP does not maintain any 
   specific knowledge of the Local Number dial-plan, but simply 
   performs prefix or default routing for an Enterprise's private 
   extensions, the SSP could just route based on the E.164 phone-
   context field value without having a separate physical "AoR" 
   database entry for each local number of that context.

5.1. Registering Local Number AoRs 
    
   Local-Numbers present a complexity for AoR Registration, because 
   their user portion is scoped to the phone-context's value.  In 
   practice the SSP domain identified by the entire AoR URI domain name 
   may not have specific knowledge of any user name within a given 
   phone-context's scope.  In fact, the Local-Number TEL URI parameters 
   (which are URI user parameters in SIP URIs), likely only have 
   meaning to the ultimate target of the request, or some entity which 
   is authoritative for the phone-context's user names.  Those 
   parameters cannot be removed by the SSP if it does not actually 
   process the user portions of the Local-Number. (i.e., if it does not 
   have the dial-plan, etc.) 
    
   With regard to this document's mechanism, what this means is that 
   such an SSP cannot physically instantiate an AoR in a database for 
   every possible Local-Number and cannot physically instantiate an 
   expanded Contact URI for every possible Local-Number user name with 
   every possible user parameter.  That does not inhibit the mechanism 
   from working or being usable, however, because the location-service 
   database model is purely an abstract concept.  What's important is 
   that the route-resolving Proxy be able to lookup and replace an AoR 
   it is authoritative for, to a Registered Contact URI, such that the 
   resultant Request URI matches what the IP-PBX expects to receive. 
    
   It is "safe" to do this because the explicitly Registered Contact 
   URI of the [draft-gin] REGISTER request had no user portion, and 
   thus no possible URI user parameters.  As defined in [draft-gin], 
   the Contact URI parameters of the REGISTER are saved and reused, but 
   not URI user parameters. 
    
   There are multiple ways of describing the logical AoR instantiation 
   and Contact URI expansion rules.  They could be described as 
   covering every possible ABNF expansion, such that every possible 
   user and parameter logically exists in the location-service database 
   (but obviously not physically exists).  Or it could be described as 
   only the phone-context value itself being an "AoR" entry and Contact 
   URI expansion, with a policy to allow any and all user names and 
   parameters to be copied instead of replaced by the Contact URI. 
    
   This remains an open issue for discussion, as discussed in section

   Regardless, for an implicitly Registered SIP AoR with a URI user 
   portion matching the syntax outlined for "local-number" TEL URIs in 
   [RFC3966]: if the 'phone-context' URI user parameter value is the 
   same SSP domain as that in the REGISTER transaction's To URI, then 
   Contact is then formed following the other AoR models, EXCEPT that

Internet-Draft          SIP MARTINI with OLIVE              April 2010 
 
 
   all URI user parameters are also included, other than the phone-
   context parameter.  For example, if the logically provisioned "AoR" 
   from the previous examples were: "sip:12345;ext=678;phone-
   context=ssp.example.net@ssp.example.net", it would logically get an 
   automatically generated Contact URI of 
   <sip:12345;ext=678@198.51.100.3:5060;foo=bar>. 
    
   Note that in practice it is not uncommon to receive a SIP URI which 
   does not strictly comply with the formatting rules of [RFC3966], but 
   is processed as if it were, based on local policies.  That is legal, 
   of course, but from a logical perspective the SIP URI is actually 
   retargeted or transformed into the syntactically valid form 
   following [RFC3966], and that form MUST be the one used for routing, 
   Contact URI expansions, etc.  Likewise, if the URI were a TEL URI, 
   it would be logically transformed into a SIP URI of the SSP's domain 
   before executing the rules. 
    
6. SSP Processing of Inbound Non-E.164 Requests 
    
   The SSP Proxy/Registrar (or equivalent entity) performs traditional 
   Proxy/Registrar behavior, based on the mapping described in Section 
   5 and [draft-gin].  For Local-Numbers in particular, the following 
   section provides additional detail. 
    
6.1. Processing of Local-Number Requests 
    
   As discussed in section 5.1, Local-Numbers present a special case 
   which may need to be handled with more explicit rules than [RFC3261] 
   or [draft-gin] currently prescribe.  If the location-service 
   database is described as having every possible expansion, then the 
   Request would be processed in the same manner as section 5 and 
   [draft-gin]. 
    
7. Interaction with Other Mechanisms 
    
   The following sections describe the means by which this mechanism 
   interacts with relevant REGISTER-related extensions currently 
   defined by the IETF. 
    
   Currently, the descriptions are somewhat informal, and omit some 
   details for the sake of brevity.  If the MARTINI working group 
   expresses interest in furthering the mechanism described by this 
   document, they will be fleshed out with more detail and formality. 
    
7.1. Globally Routable User-Agent URIs (GRUU) 
    
   The GRUU mechanism for this document's mechanism works exactly the 
   same way as defined in [draft-gin].  The [draft-gin] GRUU mechanism 

 
 
Kaplan                  Expires - October 2009               [Page 10] 
Internet-Draft          SIP MARTINI with OLIVE              April 2010 
 
 
   has no dependency on the global uniqueness of the AoR username, nor 
   on being digits or an E.164. 
    
7.2. Registration Event Package 
    
   The Registration Event Packet behavior for this document's mechanism 
   works exactly the same way as defined in [draft-gin].  The [draft-
   gin] reg-event model has no dependency on the global uniqueness of 
   the AoR username, nor on being digits or an E.164. 
    
   There is, however, an issue for Local-Numbers, if the SSP does not 
   actually know the full list of Local-Number user names in the given 
   phone-context scope.  In such a case, it is TBD for how to handle 
   this.  One obvious way would be to define a syntactic format for the 
   AoR and Contact URIs which only includes the phone-context value and 
   makes it clear the user portion and any other parameters are 
   unknown, such as "sip:!.*!;phone-
   context=ssp.example.com@ssp.example.com".  Since a "!" is not a 
   legal character in a Local-Number user name, but is legal in a SIP 
   URI user name, it would be both ABNF compliant and unambiguous from 
   Local-Numbers. 
    
   This remains an open issue for discussion, as discussed in section 
   8. 
    
7.3. Non-Adjacent Contact Registration (Path) and Service Route 
    Discovery 
    
   The Path and Service-Route behavior and considerations for this 
   document's mechanism are exactly the same as defined in [draft-gin].  
   The [draft-gin] Path and Service-Route model has no dependency on 
   the global uniqueness of the AoR username, nor on being digits or an 
   E.164. 
    
8. Open Issues 
    
   This document has several open issues, which were noted previously.  
   They center around the handling of Local-Numbers.  Local-Numbers are 
   difficult because they are doubly-scoped: once at the URI level by 
   the domain name, and internally by the phone-context URI user 
   parameter.  The authoritative system for the Local-Number user 
   portion (the system(s) which knows what they are and how to process 
   them) is not identified by the URI's domain name, but rather 
   identified by the phone-context's value.   
    
   If the phone-context identifies the SSP domain, all's well - but 
   that's rarely the case.  More likely is that it identifies an E.164 
   number, or a sub-domain of the SSP, or another domain entirely.   
    
 
 
Kaplan                  Expires - October 2009               [Page 11] 
Internet-Draft          SIP MARTINI with OLIVE              April 2010 
 
 
   This document tries to propose a mechanism to support the case when 
   the phone-context identifies the SSP's domain, and which has a 
   matching SIP AoR implicitly Registered by the IP-PBX.  However, even 
   in such a case, it does not imply the SSP has authoritative 
   information for the user name - typically the IP-PBX does.  This 
   causes issues with certain functions such as the reg-event package. 
    
   In theory, this can probably be made to work as defined in this 
   document, but there is an alternative: if we had a model for using 
   the Registered reachability information of [draft-gin] for routing 
   of requests which are not AoRs of the Registered-to domain (e.g., to 
   an AoR of "sip:charlie@pbx.example.com"), then Local-Numbers could 
   follow that routing model instead.  This would follow a more natural 
   [RFC3263] model, since effectively the phone-context indicates that 
   the authoritative administrative entity is not in fact the SSP. 
    
   A draft detailing how [draft-gin] can be used in such a model is 
   forthcoming. 
    
9. Examples 
    
   These will be fleshed out more in later versions of the draft, with 
   explanations of the processing performed at each step.  For the time 
   being, they just show the basic syntax described above. 
    
    
9.1. Usage Scenario: Basic Registration case 1 
    
   This example shows a basic bulk REGISTER transaction, followed by an 
   INVITE addressed to one of the registered terminals.
