				The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Caller Preferences" extension defined in RFC 3840 provides 
				a mechanism that allows a SIP message to convey information relating to the originator's capabilities. 
				This document makes it possible for SIP proxies to convey similar information, by extending the rr-param 
				rule defined in RFC 3261, so that the header field parameter can be used to convey
				feature tags that indicate features supported by the proxy.

			<t>
				The SIP "Caller Preferences" extension defined in RFC 3840 <xref target="RFC3840" 
				pageno="false" format="default"/> provides a mechanism that allows a SIP message to convey 
				information, using feature tags, relating to the originator's capabilities.
			</t>
			<t>
				Feature information can be useful for other SIP entities, that might trigger actions
				and enable functions based on features supported by other SIP entities.
			</t>
			<t>
				This document extends the rr-param rule defined in RFC 3261 
				<xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" format="default"/>, so that it can be used to 
				convey feature tags indicating support of features in SIP proxies. The rr-param rule 
				is used in the SIP Path, Route, Record-Route and Service-Route header fields.

			<section title="Use-case: IMS Service Continuity, handover of session in alerting state" toc="default">
				<t>
 					The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines a IP Multimedia
   					Subsystem (IMS) Service Continuity mechanism <xref target="3GPP.23.237" pageno="false" 
					format="default" /> for handover of Packet Switched (PS) sessions to Circuit Switched (CS) 
					calls.
				</t>
				<t>
   					The handover is controlled by a Service Centralization and
   					Continuity Application Server (SCC AS). When a session is established 
					the User Equipment (UE) needs to determine whether SCC AS in signalling path 
					of the session supports handover of session in alerting state (i.e. 180 Ringing 
					response has already been sent or received but the dialog is not confirmed dialog yet) 
					or not.
				</t>
				<t>
					When handover occurs and a session in alerting state exists and both UE and SCC AS 
					indicated support of the handover of session in alerting state, then the UE and SCC 
					AS perform handover for the session in alerting state.

				<t>
					The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines a IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) 
					Service Continuity mechanism <xref target="3GPP.23.237" pageno="false" format="default" /> 
					for handover of Packet Switched (PS) sessions to Circuit Switched (CS) calls. The handover 
					can be performed by a Service Centralization and Continuity Application Server (SCC AS), 
					or by a SCC AS together with an Access Transfer Control Function (ATCF), that acts as a 
					SIP proxy. Delegating part of the session handover functionality to an ATCF provides 
					advantages related to voice interruption during session handover etc, since it is located 
					in the same network as the user.
				</t>
			<section title="Use-case: IMS Enhanced Service Continuity, ATCF discovery" toc="default">
				<t>				
					In order for a SCC AS to delegate part of the session handover functionality to an ATCF, 
					when it receives a SIP REGISTER request, it needs to be informed whether there is a proxy 
					that provides ATCF functionality in the registration path.

			<section title="Use-case: IMS Inter-UE Transfer" toc="default">
				<t>
					The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines inter-UE transfer enhancements
					<xref target="3GPP.24.837" pageno="false" format="default" /> 
					which enhance delivery of media of a session to several User Equipments (UE).
				</t>
				<t>
					The Service Centralization and Continuity Application Server (SCC AS) serving one of the UEs 
					acts as local hub for the session. The UE controls the media of the session and is called 
					controller UE.
				</t>
				<t>
					Triggered by requests from the controller UE, the SCC AS serving the controller UE transfers 
					media of the session to other UEs, called controlee UEs, by sending INVITE request offering 
					the media to be transferred.  
				</t>
				<t>
					When an INVITE request is routed to the UE, the SCC AS serving the UE needs to determine 
					whether another SCC AS (i.e. SCC AS of the controller UE) is already in the signalling path. 
				</t>
				<t>
					If so, the SCC AS proxies the signalling without further handling as there is already an 
					existing local hub for the session.
				</t>
				<t>
					If not, the SCC AS acts as local hub for the session.

				When a proxy inserts a Path header field (during registration), a Service-Route header field 
				(during registration) or a Record-Route header field (during a dialog establishment), it MAY
				insert a feature tag in the header field.
			</t>
			<t>
				If a feature tag is inserted in a Path or Service-Route header field during registration, 
				the resource identified by the URI in the header field MUST provide support for the associated 
				feature for all dialogs associated with the registration, until the registration is terminated 
				or re-freshed.

				If a feature tag is inserted in a Record-Route header field during a dialog establishment, the

			<t>
				The feature tag in a header field constructed using rr-param rule indicates support of the 
				feature in the resource identified by the URI in the header field.
			</t>
			<t>	
				In order to insert a feature tag in a SIP header field constructed by using rr-param rule, 
				the feature specification MUST specify the semantics of the feature tag when inserted in that 
				specific header field. Unless the feature specification defines such semantics, a the feature
				tag MUST NOT be included in that specific header field.
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE: If a route set is built using Path, Record-Route or Service-Route header fields, any 
				inserted feature tag will be copied into the associated Route header fields, together with other

				tags present in Route header fields in such cases.

		<section title="Direction" anchor="sec-dir" toc="default">
			<t>
				When a proxy inserts a feature tag in order to indicate support of a capability, the indicated
				capability might be indicated both towards downstream and upstream SIP entities.
			</t>
			<t>	
				In order to indicate a capability only towards SIP entities in one direction, either the feature tag
				semantics need to be defined in a way so that SIP entities know whether the indicated capability
				applies to them or not, or alternatively, the SIP entity that inserts the feature tag needs to ensure that
				the feature tag is only sent towards the direction for which the capability applies.
