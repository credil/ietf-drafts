    Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) Additions to LIST Command
                   draft-elie-nntp-list-additions-00

Abstract

   This document defines a set of enhancements to the Network News
   Transfer Protocol (NNTP) that allows a client to request extended
   information maintained by NNTP servers as for local use and
   distribution policy.  These enhancements are made as new keywords to
   the existing LIST capability described in RFC 3977.

   This memo updates and formalizes the LIST DISTRIBUTIONS and LIST
   SUBSCRIPTIONS commands defined in RFC 2980.  It also adds the LIST
   MODERATORS and LIST MOTD commands, and specifies additional values
   returned by the existing LIST ACTIVE command for the status of a
   newsgroup.

Internet-Draft       Additions to NNTP LIST Command        November 2009


1.  Introduction

   The NNTP specification [RFC3977] defines the LIST capability and a
   few keywords which can be used with that command:  ACTIVE,
   ACTIVE.TIMES, DISTRIB.PATS, HEADERS, NEWSGROUPS, and OVERVIEW.FMT.
   As other widely used variants of the LIST command currently exist,
   they are formalized in this document.

   The DISTRIBUTIONS and SUBSCRIPTIONS variants have originally been
   documented in [RFC2980].  The LIST DISTRIBUTIONS command is sent by a
   news client to obtain a list of relevant distributions known by a
   news server along with their descriptions.  The LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS
   command is sent by a news client when first connecting to a news
   server so as to obtain a list of recommended newsgroups available on
   it.  Both of these commands are intended to be used in place of hard-
   coding news clients to use specific distributions or look for
   specific default newsgroups.

   The MOTD variant has originally been documented in
   [I-D.draft-hernacki-nntplist] (which also defines the SUBSCRIPTIONS
   variant).  The LIST MOTD command is sent by a news client to obtain a
   "message of the day" containing useful information regarding the
   current state of a news server.

   The MODERATORS variant had not been documented before.  The LIST
   MODERATORS command is sent by a news client to obtain a list of
   associations between a moderated newsgroup and its submission
   address.

   The ACTIVE variant has already been documented in [RFC3977] but the
   meaning of only three status fields in response to the LIST ACTIVE
   command has been specified:  "y", "n", and "m".  These status are
   particularly useful for readers since they describe local posting
   rights.  This memo defines three other widespread values for the
   status field:  "j", "x", and "=" followed by the name of a newsgroup.
   These new status are particularly useful for peers since they mainly
   describe how remote articles coming from peers are locally handled by
   the news server.

   This specification is to be read in conjunction with the NNTP base
   specification [RFC3977].  Except where specifically stated otherwise,
   in the case of a conflict between these two documents, [RFC3977]
   takes precedence over this one.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The notational conventions used in this document are the same as
   those in [RFC3977], and any term not defined in this document has the



Elie                      Expires May 18, 2010                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       Additions to NNTP LIST Command        November 2009


   same meaning as it does in that one.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In the examples, commands from the client are indicated with [C], and
   responses from the server are indicated with [S].  The client is the
   initiator of the NNTP connection; the server is the other endpoint.

2.  New LIST Variants

   The LIST capability is defined in Section 7.6 of [RFC3977].  It
   allows the server to provide blocks of useful information to the
   client.

   This document provides four new keywords to the LIST capability:
   DISTRIBUTIONS, MODERATORS, MOTD, and SUBSCRIPTIONS.

   All these keywords are optional and correspond to an eponymous
   variant of the LIST command.

2.1.  Advertising the New LIST Variants

   When a news server implements a variant of the LIST command as
   described in this specification, it advertises the corresponding
   feature in the LIST capability.  Where one of these new LIST keywords
   is advertised, it MUST have the meaning given in this specification.

   For instance, if a news server implements the SUBSCRIPTIONS variant,
   it will add the SUBSCRIPTIONS keyword to the LIST capability in
   response to the CAPABILITIES command (see Section 5.2 of [RFC3977]):

      [C] CAPABILITIES
      [S] 101 Capability list:
      [S] VERSION 2
      [S] READER
      [S] LIST ACTIVE NEWSGROUPS SUBSCRIPTIONS
      [S] .
      [C] LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS
      [S] 215 List of recommended newsgroups follows
      [S] local.welcome
      [S] local.test
      [S] news.newusers.questions
      [S] news.announce.newusers
      [S] .

   For all the new LIST variants described in this specification, an
   empty response can be sent to the client:

Internet-Draft       Additions to NNTP LIST Command        November 2009


      [C] LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS
      [S] 215 List of recommended newsgroups follows
      [S] .

   It means that the information is maintained by the news server but
   that it is voluntarily empty.  As often as not, the news server
   maintains the information in a configuration file.  This file can be
   empty or contain only commented or blank lines, which leads to a
   voluntary absence of information.

   When the news server does not maintain the information (for instance
   when the configuration file does not exist), the 503 response code
   MUST be returned:

      [C] LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS
      [S] 503 No list of recommended newsgroups available

2.2.  LIST DISTRIBUTIONS

2.2.1.  Usage

   Syntax
      LIST DISTRIBUTIONS

   Responses
      215    Distributions list follows (multi-line)

2.2.2.  Description

   See Section 7.6.1 of [RFC3977] for general requirements of the LIST
   command.

   The distributions list is maintained by some NNTP servers to contain
   the name of each distribution that is known by the news server and a
   short description about the meaning of the distribution.

   The information is returned as a multi-line data block following the
   215 response code and contains one line per distribution.  Each line
   of this list MUST consist of two fields separated from each other by
   one or more space or TAB characters (the usual pratice is a single
   TAB).  The first field is the name of the distribution, and the
   second field is a short description of the distribution.  There are
   no leading or trailing whitespaces in a line.  The description MAY
   contain whitespaces.

   The order of distributions in the list is not significant; the server
   need not even consistently return the same order or the same results
   if this command is used more than once in a session.

Internet-Draft       Additions to NNTP LIST Command        November 2009


   The same distribution SHOULD NOT appear twice in the output of this
   command.

   The description MUST be in UTF-8.

   The distributions list is not newsgroup-based, and an argument MUST
   NOT be specified.  Otherwise, a 501 response code MUST be returned.

   The distributions list MAY be empty.  If the server does not maintain
   the information, a 503 response code MUST be returned.

   The client MAY use this information to provide the user with a list
   of known distributions he can use.  If the news server implements the
   LIST DISTRIBUTIONS command, it SHOULD also implement the LIST
   DISTRIB.PATS command and describe in the distributions list at least
   all the distributions present in the distrib.pats list so that the
   client can use both of these commands jointly.  The distrib.pats list
   is defined in Section 7.6.5 of [RFC3977]; it assists clients to
   choose a value for the content of the Distribution header of a news
   article being posted (see Section 3.2.4 of [RFC5536] for the
   definition of this header).

2.2.3.  Example

   Example of a joint use of LIST DISTRIB.PATS and LIST DISTRIBUTIONS:

2.3.  LIST MODERATORS

2.3.1.  Usage

   Syntax
      LIST MODERATORS

   Responses
      215    Moderators list follows (multi-line)

2.3.2.  Description

   See Section 7.6.1 of [RFC3977] for general requirements of the LIST
   command.

   The moderators list is maintained by some NNTP servers to make
   clients aware of the submission address the news server will use when
   an article is locally posted to a moderated newsgroup.

   The information is returned as a multi-line data block following the
   215 response code.  Each line of this list MUST consist of two fields
   separated from each other by a colon (":" or %x3A).  The first field
   is a wildmat (which may be a simple newsgroup name), and the second
   field is the submission address for newsgroups matching that wildmat.
   There are no leading or trailing whitespaces in a line.  The
   submission address MAY contain colons (":").

   The order of lines in the list is significant:  the first matching
   line is used.  Consequently, specific patterns should be listed
   before general patterns.

   When an unapproved article is locally posted to a moderated
   newsgroup, it is forwarded to a moderator (see Section 3.5.1 of
   [RFC5537]), using the submission address for that newsgroup.  This
   submission address is the second field of the first matching line in
   the moderators list.  It is an e-mail address with one exception:  at
   most one occurrence of the case-sensitive string "%s" (%x25.73) may
   occur anywhere in the address.  If present, the news server will
   replace it, when forwarding the article to the moderator, with the
   name of the matching newsgroup, with all periods ("." or %x2E) in the
   name changed to dashes ("-" or %x2D).  If there is a literal "%" in
   the submission address, it MUST be written as "%%", even if not
   followed by an "s".

      NOTE:  How submission addresses are created and maintained is
      outside the scope of this specification.

   The moderators list is not newsgroup-based, and an argument MUST NOT



Elie                      Expires May 18, 2010                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       Additions to NNTP LIST Command        November 2009


   be specified.  Otherwise, a 501 response code MUST be returned.

   The moderators list MAY be empty.  If the server does not maintain
   the information, a 503 response code MUST be returned, though these
   two cases SHOULD NOT occur if the news server is an injecting agent
   that carries moderated newsgroups.

2.3.3.  Example

   Example of output:

      [C] CAPABILITIES
      [S] 101 Capability list:
      [S] VERSION 2
      [S] READER
      [S] POST
      [S] LIST ACTIVE MODERATORS NEWSGROUPS
      [S] .
      [C] LIST MODERATORS
      [S] 215 List of submission addresses follows
      [S] foo.bar:announce@example.com
      [S] local.*:%s@localhost
      [S] *:%s@moderators.example.com
      [S] .

   The following table describes a few examples of associations between
   a moderated newsgroup and its submission address on a news server
   whose moderators list is the one of the previous example:

   +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+
   | Name of the moderated       | Submission address                  |
   | newsgroup                   |                                     |
   +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+
   | foo.bar                     | announce@example.com                |
   | local.test                  | local-test@localhost                |
   | alt.dev.null                | alt-dev-null@moderators.example.com |
   | alt.test-me                 | alt-test-me@moderators.example.com  |
   +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+

      NOTE:  Periods are changed to dashes, and dashes are left alone.
      It implies that two moderated newsgroups whose names differ only
      by changing a period to a dash would go to the same address.
      Therefore, such moderated newsgroup pairs SHOULD NOT be created on
      a news server.

      Similarly, a news server SHOULD NOT carry two moderated newsgroups
      whose names differ only by the case of their characters.

   [[Editorial comment 1:  Do we have possible issues with the syntax of
   generated e-mail addresses?  I read in RFC 3696 and its errata that
   the local part of an e-mail address is limited to 64 characters, and
   the whole address to 256 characters.  Section 7.2 of USEAGE mentions
   that a newsgroup name is limited to 66 characters, which may cause
   problems. --JE]]

2.4.  LIST MOTD

2.4.1.  Usage

   Syntax
      LIST MOTD

   Responses
      215    Information follows (multi-line)

2.4.2.  Description

   See Section 7.6.1 of [RFC3977] for general requirements of the LIST
   command.

   The motd list contains a "message of the day" relevant to the news
   server.  It is intended to provide notification and communication
   between the news administrator and the news user.  For instance,
   notification of upcoming downtime or information about new facilities
   available on the news server can be advertised via this means of
   communication.

   The information is returned as a multi-line data block following the
   215 response code.  This text is not guaranteed to be in any
   particular format although, like all multi-line data blocks, it is
   "dot-stuffed".

   The server need not return the same information if this command is
   used more than once in a session.  It MAY indeed send a different
   message of the day depending on the state of the session.  For
   instance, on a mode-switching news server, the information can be
   different between its transit mode and its reader mode, or between an
   authenticated session and an unauthenticated session.

   The information MUST be in UTF-8.

   The motd list is not newsgroup-based, and an argument MUST NOT be

   specified.  Otherwise, a 501 response code MUST be returned.

   The motd list MAY be empty.  If the server does not maintain the
   information, a 503 response code MUST be returned.

   It is up to the client to decide when and how to display this message
   to the user.  No timestamp or date of last modification date is
   provided.  The client may want to keep some state if it wishes to
   show the message only upon modification.

2.5.2.  Description

   See Section 7.6.1 of [RFC3977] for general requirements of the LIST
   command.

   The subscriptions list is maintained by some NNTP servers to provide
   the client with a list of recommended newsgroups.

   The information is returned as a multi-line data block following the
   215 response code.  Each line of this list MUST consist of a
   newsgroup name.  There are no leading or trailing whitespaces in a
   line.

   The order of newsgroups in the list is significant:  they are listed
   by order of importance, the first newsgroup being the most important
   to subscribe to.

   The same newsgroup name SHOULD NOT appear twice in the output of this
   command.  The list SHOULD contain only newsgroups the news server
   carries.

   The subscriptions list is newsgroup-based, and a wildmat MAY be
   specified, in which case the response is limited to only the groups,
   if any, whose names match the wildmat.  Note that the wildmat
   argument is a new feature in this specification and servers that do
   not support CAPABILITIES or do not advertise the SUBSCRIPTIONS
   keyword in the LIST capability (and therefore do not conform to this
   specification) are unlikely to support it.

   The subscriptions list MAY be empty.  If the server does not maintain
   the information, a 503 response code MUST be returned.

   The client MAY use this information the first time it connects to the
   news server so as to initialize the list of default subscribed
   newsgroups.  This list should therefore contain groups intended for
   new users on the news server or Usenet in general.  For instance
   newsgroups dedicated to testing, support, annoucement, or FAQs.  The
   client MAY present the groups in the order of appearance in the list
   to the user.  When the subscriptions list is maintained and non
   empty, the news client SHOULD use it, instead of a hard-coded default
   list, if any.

3.  Additions to LIST ACTIVE

   This document specifies three new status fields that can be used in
   the answers to LIST ACTIVE:  "j", "x", and "=" followed by the name
   of a newsgroup.

   [[Editorial comment 3:  How can we define new status?  Should a new
   capability or keyword be provided?  We have to make sure that if for
   instance "x" is returned by a compliant news server, it has the
   meaning specified in this document.  RFC 3977 mentions that "Other
   values for the status may exist; the definition of these other values
   and the circumstances under which they are returned may be specified
   in an extension or may be private to the server."  And also that
   "Each extension MUST define at least one new capability label (this
   will often, but need not, be the name of one of these new commands)."
   A capability label, then...  But it seems overkill!  Unless we do not
   speak about an extension for that, but something else? --JE]]

3.1.  New status fields

   The LIST ACTIVE command is defined in Section 7.6.3 of [RFC3977].
   The fourth field of each line of this list indicates the current
   status of the newsgroup whose name is specified in the first field.
   Three status are defined in [RFC3977]:

Internet-Draft       Additions to NNTP LIST Command        November 2009


   "y"  Posting is permitted.

   "n"  Posting is not permitted.

   "m"  Postings will be forwarded to the newsgroup moderator.

   This document defines three other status which can also be used:

   "j"  Articles are filed under the "junk" newsgroup.

   "x"  Postings and articles from peers are not permitted.

   "=other.group"  Articles are filed under the newsgroup named
      "other.group".

   The server SHOULD use these values when these meanings are required
   and MUST NOT use them with any other meaning.

   [[Editorial comment 4:  Should other status be standardized?  I
   suggest one for "local postings only" ("l" status) which I believe
   should be defined because "n" exists.  Another one that might be
   useful would be an "r" status for a to-be-removed newsgroup.  For
   instance, when an rmgroup control article arrives for a newsgroup
   (see Section 5.2.2 of RFC 5537), its status could be changed to "r"
   instead of just being removed.  No more articles could then be filed
   under that newsgroup which would be bound to expire when all the
   articles it contains have been expired.  (Or we could have an "r"
   followed by the number of seconds since January 1st, 1970.  The
   corresponding date would specify when the newsgroup has been marked
   as to-be-removed, which could allow to really remove it after a
   certain number of days.)  This way, people would have some time to
   read last postings in the newsgroup.  And it would also permit to
   easily fix possible mistakes made by hierarchy maintainers who could
   inadvertently remove a group in a checkgroups, and then reinstate it.
   My only concern is that users may try to post an article to the
   newsgroup, without success (but the case is already present with
   other status -- and it is a client implementation design). --JE]]

   The difference between a newsgroup with status "n" and a newsgroup
   with status "x" is that articles from peers are accepted for the
   former, and rejected for the latter.  A newsgroup with status "x" is
   considered as closed:  no new articles will arrive in such a group.
   On the contrary, articles from peers will arrive in a newsgroup with
   status "n".  Local postings are not allowed in a newsgroup with one
   of these two status.

   No articles will be filed in a newsgroup with status "j".  If an
   article is locally posted to such a group or is received from a peer,



Elie                      Expires May 18, 2010                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft       Additions to NNTP LIST Command        November 2009


   and in case it is not crossposted to some other valid groups, it will
   be filed into the "junk" newsgroup instead.  Otherwise, it is filed
   only into the valid newsgroups it is crossposted to.

      NOTE:  The status "j" is used only by news servers on which the
      newsgroup "junk" exists.  This group has special meaning.  It
      usually contains all the postings which cannot file under a
      newsgroup name.  Instead of rejecting an article which contains an
      invalid Newsgroups header or which is posted to newsgroups it does
      not carry, a news server may accept such an article and file it
      under a generic newsgroup named "junk".  This newsgroup may be
      available to news readers and is often used by a news server as a
      way to locally store an article with the view to transmitting it
      to its peers (which may carry some of the newsgroups the article
      was posted to).

      Depending on the configuration of the news server, mentioning a
      newsgroup with status "j" is different than simply not listing the
      group, since articles arriving in unknown newsgroups MAY be
      rejected.

   When the status field begins with an equal sign ("=" or %x3D), the
   name of an existing newsgroup on the news server MUST immediately
   follow the sign.  If the status field of "foo.bar" is "=other.group",
   it means that "foo.bar" is an alias for "other.group".  These two
   newsgroups are distinct; they do not share their articles or their
   article numbers.  Local postings to "foo.bar" are not allowed, but
   articles from peers are accepted for "foo.bar" and treated as though
   they were actually posted to "other.group" (that is to say according
   to the meaning of the status field of "other.group").  The contents
   of their Newsgroups headers MUST NOT be altered.

   Alias groups are typically used during a transition between two
   newsgroups.

   An alias MUST NOT point to another alias group.  The newsgroup an
   alias points to SHOULD exist on the news server.  If an alias is
   listed in the active list, the newsgroup it points to is not also
   listed in the active list when a wildmat is given to the LIST ACTIVE
   command, and the name of the newsgroup the alias points to does not
   match the wildmat.

   The following table summarizes what usually happens to an article
   posted to only the newsgroup "foo.bar", depending on its status field
   on the news server:

      NOTE:  The status of a newsgroup only indicates how articles
      arriving to that newsgroup are normally processed; news servers
      MAY provide clients with special privileges to allow or disallow
      some rights in these newsgroups.  This specification defines
      neither these rights nor whether or not articles posted to these
      groups should be propagated to other peers.

      If the news server may accept articles from the client during the
      session (possibly after successful authentication), it SHOULD NOT
      return a status like "n" or "x" which suggests that articles are
      not accepted in the corresponding newsgroup.

3.2.  Example

   Example of an article posted to an alias group by a peer:

      [C] LIST ACTIVE
      [S] 215 List of newsgroups follows
      [S] foo.bar 21 12 y
      [S] misc.test 3002322 3000234 =foo.bar

      [S] 225 Header information follows
      [S] 0 misc.test
      [S] .

   The Newsgroups header of this article is kept untouched.  This
   article is filed under "foo.bar" even though it has originally been
   posted, and still propagates to other peers, to the newsgroup
   "misc.test".

4.  Augmented BNF Syntax for These Additions to the LIST Command

   This section describes the formal syntax of the new LIST variants
   defined in this document using [RFC5234].  It extends the syntax in
   Section 9 of [RFC3977], and non-terminals not defined in this
   document are defined there.  The [RFC3977] ABNF should be imported
   first before attempting to validate these rules.

Internet-Draft       Additions to NNTP LIST Command        November 2009


4.1.  Commands

   This syntax extends the non-terminal <list-arguments> which
   represents the variants of the LIST command.

     ; distributions, moderators, motd
     list-arguments =/ "DISTRIBUTIONS" / "MODERATORS" / "MOTD"

     ; subscriptions
     list-arguments =/ "SUBSCRIPTIONS" [WS wildmat]

4.2.  Responses

   This syntax extends the non-terminals <newsgroup-status> and <list-
   content> which respectively represent the status field returned by
   the LIST ACTIVE command and the response contents for the LIST
   command.

     ; active
     newsgroup-status =/ %x6A / %x78 /   ; case-sensitive "j" and "x"
           newsgroup-alias
     newsgroup-alias =  "=" newsgroup-name

     list-distributions-content =
           *(distribution WS distribution-description CRLF)
     distribution-description = S-TEXT

     ; moderators
     list-content =/ list-moderators-content
     list-moderators-content =
           *(wildmat ":" moderators-address CRLF)
     moderators-address = S-TEXT

     ; motd
     list-content =/ list-motd-content
     list-motd-content = *(*U-CHAR CRLF)

     ; subscriptions
     list-content =/ list-subscriptions-content
     list-subscriptions-content = *(newsgroup-name CRLF)

5.  Internationalisation Considerations

   No new internationalisation considerations are introduced by this
   extension, beyond those already described in the core specification
   [RFC3977].

   In particular, newsgroup names SHOULD be restricted to US-ASCII until
   a successor to [RFC5536] standardises another approach.

   Distribution descriptions and the message of the day MUST be in
   UTF-8.

6.  Security Considerations

   No new security considerations are introduced by this extension,
   beyond those already described in the core specification [RFC3977]
   and the Netnews Architecture and Protocol [RFC5537] (especially
   distribution leakage and e-mail Denial of Service during the
   moderation process).

7.  IANA Considerations

   This section gives a formal definition of this extension as required
   by Section 3.3.3 of [RFC3977] for the IANA registry.

   o  This extension provides additional keywords to the existing LIST
      capability defined in Section 7.6 of [RFC3977].  New status are
      also added to the ACTIVE variant of the LIST command.

   o  The capability label that this extension extends is "LIST".

   o  This extension adds four optional arguments to the "LIST"
      capability label:  "DISTRIBUTIONS", "MODERATORS", "MOTD", and
      "SUBSCRIPTIONS", indicating which new variants of the LIST command
      are supported.

   o  This extension defines four new commands, LIST DISTRIBUTIONS, LIST
      MODERATORS, LIST MOTD, and LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS, whose behaviour,
      arguments, and responses are defined in Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4,
      and 2.5 respectively.

   o  This extension does not associate any new responses with pre-
      existing NNTP commands.

   o  This extension does not affect the maximum length of commands or
      initial response lines.

   o  This extension does not alter pipelining, and the LIST
      DISTRIBUTIONS, LIST MODERATORS, LIST MOTD, and LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS
      commands can be pipelined.

   o  Use of this extension does not alter the capabilities list.

   o  This extension does not cause any pre-existing command to produce
      a 401, 480, or 483 response.

   o  This extension is unaffected by any use of the MODE READER
      command.

   o  This extension does not affect the overall behaviour of a server
      or client than via the new commands.
