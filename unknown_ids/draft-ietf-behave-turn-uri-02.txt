Internet-Draft                  TURN URIs                       May 2009


1.  Introduction

   The TURN specification [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] defines a process for a
   TURN client to find TURN servers by using DNS SRV resource records,
   but this process does not let the TURN server administrators
   provision the preferred TURN transport protocol between the client
   and the server and for the TURN client to discover this preference.
   This document defines a S-NAPTR application [RFC3958] for this
   purpose.  This application defines "RELAY" as application service tag
   and "turn.udp", "turn.tcp", and "turn.tls" as application protocol
   tags.

   To simplify the provisioning of TURN clients, this document also
   defines a TURN and a TURNS URI scheme and a resolution mechanism to
   convert these URIs into a list of IP addresses, ports and TURN
   transport protocols.

   Another usage of the resolution mechanism described in this document
   would be Remote Hosting as described in [RFC3958] section 4.4.  For
   example a VoIP provider who does not want to deploy TURN servers
   could use the servers deployed by another company but could still
   want to provide configuration parameters to its customers without
   explicitly showing this relationship.  The mechanism permits one to
   implement this indirection, without preventing the company hosting
   the TURN servers from managing them as it see fit.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Syntax of a TURN or TURNS URI

   A TURN/TURNS URI has the following ABNF syntax [RFC5234]:

   turnURI   = scheme ":" host [ ":" port ] [ "?transport=" transport ]
   scheme    = "turn" / "turns"
   transport = "udp" / "tcp" / transport-ext
   transport-ext = 1*unreserved

   <host>, <port> and <unreserved> are specified in [RFC3986].

4.  TURN or TURNS URI Resolution

   The URI resolution mechanism is used only to create an allocation.
   All other transactions use the IP address, transport and port used
   for a successful allocation creation.

   The URI resolution algorithm uses <scheme>, <host>, <port> and
   <transport> as input.  It also uses a list ordered by preference of
   TURN transports (UDP, TCP, TLS) supported by the application using
   the TURN client.  The output of the algorithm is a list of {IP
   address, transport, port} tuples that a TURN client can try in order
   to create an allocation on a TURN server.

   An Allocate error response as specified in section 6.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] is processed as a failure as specified by
   [RFC3958] section 2.2.4.  The resolution stops when a TURN client
   gets a successful Allocate response from a TURN server.  After an
   allocation succeeds or all the allocations fail the resolution
   context MUST be discarded and the URI resolution algorithm MUST be
   restarted from the beginning for any subsequent allocation.  Servers
   blacklisted as described in section 6.4 of [I-D.ietf-behave-turn]
   should not be used for the specified duration even if returned by a
   subsequent resolution.

   In some steps <transport> and <scheme> have to be converted to a TURN
   transport.  If <scheme> is defined as "turn" and <transport> is
   defined as "udp" then the TURN UDP transport is used.  If <scheme> is
   defined as "turn" and <transport> is defined as "tcp" then the TURN
   TCP transport is used.  If <scheme> is defined as "turns" and
   <transport> is defined as "tcp" then the TURN TLS transport is used.

   First the resolution algorithm checks that the URI can be resolved
   with the list of TURN transports supported:

   o  If <scheme> is defined as "turn" and <transport> is defined as
      "udp" but the list of TURN transports does not contain UDP then
      the resolution MUST stop with an error.
   o  If <scheme> is defined as "turn" and <transport> is defined as
      "tcp" but the list of TURN transports does not contain TCP or TLS
      then the resolution MUST stop with an error.
   o  If <scheme> is defined as "turns" and <transport> is defined as
      "udp" then the algorithm MUST stop with an error.
   o  If <scheme> is defined as "turns" and <transport> is defined as
      "tcp" but the list of TURN transports does not contain TLS then
      the resolution MUST stop with an error.
   o  If <scheme> is defined as "turns" and <transport> is not defined
      but the list of TURN transports does not contain TLS then the
      resolution MUST stop with an error.

   o  If <transport> is defined but unknown then the resolution MUST
      stop with an error.

   Then the algorithm applies the following steps:

   1.  If <host> is an IP address then it indicates the specific IP
       address to be used.  If <port> is not defined, the default port
       declared in [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] for the SRV service name
       defined in <scheme> is used.  If <transport> is defined then
       <scheme> and <transport> are converted to a TURN transport as
       specified above.  If <transport> is not defined, the TURN
       transports supported by the application are tried by preference
       order.  If the TURN client cannot contact a TURN server with this
       IP address and port on any of the transports then the resolution
       MUST stop with an error.

   2.  If <host> is a domain name and <port> is defined, then <host> is
       resolved to a list of IP addresses via DNS A and AAAA queries.
       If <transport> is defined then <scheme> and <transport> are
       converted to a TURN transport as specified above.  If <transport>
       is not defined, the TURN transports supported by the application
       are tried by preference order.  If the TURN client cannot contact
       a TURN server with this port and any combination of transports
       and resolved IP addresses then the resolution MUST stop with an
       error.

   3.  If <host> is a domain name and <port> is not defined but
       <transport> is defined then <host> is converted to a list of IP
       address and port tuples via a DNS SRV query as defined in
       [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] section 6.1. <scheme> is used for the
       service name and <transport> is used for the protocol name in the
       SRV algorithm [RFC2782].  If the TURN client cannot contact a
       TURN server at any of the IP address, port and transport tuples
       returned by the SRV algorithm then the resolution MUST stop with
       an error.  The SRV algorithm recommends doing an A query if the
       SRV query returns an error or no SRV RR.  In this case the
       default port declared in [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] for the SRV
       service name defined in <scheme> must be used for contacting the
       TURN server.  Also in this case, this specification modifies the
       SRV algorithm by recommending an A or AAAA query.

   4.  If <host> is a domain name and <port> and <transport> are not
       defined, then <host> is converted to an ordered list of IP
       address, port and transport tuples via the S-NAPTR algorithm
       defined in [RFC3958] with a "RELAY" Application Service Tag. The
       TURN transports supported by the application are converted in
       Application Protocol Tags by using "turn.udp" if the TURN
       transport is UDP, "turn.tcp" if the TURN transport is TCP and

       "turn.tls" if the TURN transport is TLS.  The order to try the
       protocol tags is provided by the ranking of the first set of
       NAPTR records.  If multiple protocol tags have the same ranking,
       the preferred order set by the application is used.  If the TURN
       client cannot contact a TURN server with any of the IP address,
       port and transport tuples returned by the S-NAPTR algorithm then
       the resolution MUST stop with an error.  If the first NAPTR SRV
       query does not return any result then <host> is converted to a
       list of IP address and port tuples by using the algorithm
       specified in step 3 for each of the TURN transports supported by
       the application by order of preference.


5.  Example

   With the DNS RRs in Figure 1 and a preferred protocol list of {TLS,
   TCP, UDP}, the resolution algorithm will convert the "turn:
   example.com" URI to the list of IP addresses, port and protocol
   tuples in Table 1.


   example.com.
   IN NAPTR 100 10 "" "RELAY:turn.udp" "" datagram.example.com.
   IN NAPTR 200 10 "" "RELAY:turn.tcp:turn.tls" "" stream.example.com.

   datagram.example.com.
   IN NAPTR 100 10 "S" "RELAY:turn.udp" "" _udp._turn.example.com.

   stream.example.com.
   IN NAPTR 100 10 "S" "RELAY:turn.tcp" "" _turn._tcp.example.com.
   IN NAPTR 200 10 "A" "RELAY:turn.tls" "" a.example.com.

   _turn._udp.example.com.
   IN SRV   0   0  3478 a.example.com.

   _turn._tcp.example.com.
   IN SRV   0   0  5000 a.example.com.

   a.example.com.
   IN A     192.0.2.1

A.3.  Design Notes

   o  The Application Service Tag is "RELAY" so other relaying
      mechanisms than TURN (e.g., TWIST) can be registered as
      Application Protocol Tags.
   o  S-NAPTR was preferred to U-NAPTR because there is no use case for
      U-NAPTR.
   o  <password> is not used in the URIs because it is deprecated.
      <username> is not used in the URIs because it is not used to guide
      the resolution mechanism.
   o  As discussed in Dublin, there is no generic parameters in the URI
      to prevent compatibity issues.
   o  Adding optional capabilities (IPv6 allocation, preserve bit,
      etc...) in the resolution process was rejected at the Dublin
      meeting.
