Abstract

   This document describes why a private network indication is needed.
   A private network indication allows other nodes in a network to treat
   private network traffic to a different set of rules then public
   network traffic.  The indication also distinguishes one private
   network from another private network.

Internet-Draft         private network indication          February 2008


1.  Introduction

1.1.  General

   ETSI TISPAN defines Next Generation Networks (NGN) which uses the
   3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS (IP Multimedia
   Subsystem) which in turn uses SIP (RFC3261 [2]) as its main
   signalling protocol.  (For more information on the IMS, a detailed
   description can be found in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6] and 3GPP TS 24.229
   [7].)

1.2.  Business communication

   In the context of its work on business communiction support in public
   next generation networks (NGN), ETSI TISPAN has identified a
   framework [5] for the support of business communication capabilities
   by the NGN.  As well as the direct attachment of Next Generation
   Corporate Network (NGCN) equipment, this includes the capability to
   "host" functionality relating to the enterprise network within the
   NGN itself.

   These hosting arrangements are:
   a)  virtual leased line, where NGCN sites are interconnected through
       the NGN;
   b)  business trunking application, where the NGN hosts transit
       capabilities between NGCN's, break-in capabilities from NGN to
       NGCN and break-out capabilities from NGCN to NGN; and
   c)  hosted enterprise services, where an NGN hosts originating and/or
       terminating business communication capabilities for business
       communication users that are directly attached to an NGN.

   ETSI TISPAN has requirements that can be met by the introduction of
   an explicit indication for private network traffic.

   The traffic generated or received by an NGN on behalf of a private
   network can be either:
   o  public network traffic: traffic sent to the NGN for processing
      according to normal rules of the NGN.  This type of traffic is
      known as public network traffic;
   o  private network traffic: traffic sent to the NGN for processing
      according to an agreed set of rules specific to an enterprise.
      This type of traffic is known as private network traffic.  Private
      network traffic is normally within a single enterprise, but
      private network traffic can also exist between two different
      enterprises if not precluded for regulatory reasons.

1.3.  Indication types

   A private network indication as proposed by this document should not
   be confused with an indication to the local user that the remote user
   is in the same private network.  This has traditionally resulted in
   PBXs providing distinctive ringing on incoming calls, but has also
   been used as input to services provided to the end user, e.g.
   different forwarding conditions and so on.  Traditionally, this has
   only been applied where the call does not enter the public network at
   all, but we regard that limitation as a technical limitation rather
   than as one precluded by the desires of the service (i.e.
   traditionally there has been no special indication of this from the
   public network).  Without such an indicator one would have to rely on
   calling line identity, which would need to be reliable and trusted,
   to avoid a false indication that this is a private network internal
   call when it is in fact someone wishing to use that indication for
   fraudulent purposes.  There may be a need for such a explicit
   indication, but that is not covered by this document.

   Rather private network indication as proposed by this document is an
   indication to each and every network element traversed that this is
   private network traffic as opposed to public network traffic.  This
   indication is not for the end user on the private network.  It is an
   indication that special service arrangements apply for an enterprise,
   and therefore it is an indication of service on behalf of an
   enterprise, not an indication of service to an end private network
   (NGCN) user.

   In order to allow NGN IMS nodes to perform different processing ETSI
   TISPAN formulated the following requirements on NGN:
   1.  The NGN shall distinguish public network traffic from private
       network traffic.
   2.  The NGN shall distinguish private network traffic belonging to
       one enterprise from that belonging to another enterprise.

   To summarize a few example reasons for a public telecommunication
   network to make the distinction between the two types of traffic:
   o  Different regulations apply to the two types of traffic, most
      notably lawful intercept requirements.  Another example is
      emergency calls may be handled differently depending on the type
      of traffic.
   o  Different charging regimes may apply.
   o  Call recording for business reasons (e.g. quality control,
      training, non-repudiation) might apply only to a specific type of
      traffic.
   o  Different levels of signalling and/or media transparency may apply
      to the different types of traffic.

Internet-Draft         private network indication          February 2008


   The indication is not regarded as appropriate as an indication from
   the end UA attached to an NGCN or hosted enterprise service equipment
   in the NGN.  In this case any mixture of traffic from the same device
   relates to two or more distinct users, one belonging to the
   enterprise network and receiving service from that enterprise
   network, and one belonging to the NGN and receiving service from that
   network.  Any distinction between the traffic types from such a
   device should be based on the authentication performed.

   There are several reasons why there is a need for an explicit
   indication in the signalling:
   1.  As calling and target addresses can not in all cases be used to
       determine whether a certain call is to be treated as private or
       public network traffic.
   2.  Separate nodes in the network need to be able to act on the type
       of traffic being handled, when implicit schemes would be used it
       would require distribution of such enterprise specific logic over
       multiple nodes of multiple operators.  That is clearly not a
       manageable architecture.
   3.  There may be cases where treating the call as a public network
       call although both participants are from the same enterprise is
       advantageous to the enterprise.

   Given the above background this document will formulate requirements
   on SIP for support of an explicit private network indicator.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].


3.  Definitions

3.1.  Public network traffic

   Traffic sent to or received from a public telecommunication network
   for processing according to the normal rules.

3.2.  Private network traffic

   Traffic sent to or received from a public telecommunication network
   for processing according to an agreed set of rules specific to an
   enterprise or a community of closely related enterprises.

Internet-Draft         private network indication          February 2008


3.3.  Trust domain

   The term Trust Domain in this document is taken from RFC3324 [3].  A
   trust domain applies to the private network indication.  The rules
   for specifying such a trust domain are specified in RFC3324 [3] which
   require the filling out a Spec (T).

   The Spec (T) need not specify the same contents and trust domain
   boundaries that are used for other headers like the P-Asserted-
   Identity.

   [It is still being discussed to what extent Spec (T) differs, i.e.
   whether different domain boundaries are necessary for private network
   indication and network asserted identity. ]


4.  Requirements

   This section lists the requirements on SIP derived from consideration
   in Section 1:
   R1:  It is REQUIRED that an indication can be send in SIP initial
        requests for a dialog or SIP standalone requests that indicates
        that the request or associated session is to be treated
        according to the rules of private network traffic.
   R2:  The indication from R1 can be inserted by a SIP proxy belonging
        to an administrative entity where for onward routeing, the
        traffic within that administrative entity needs to be so
        distinguished.  The indication is not needed where the traffic
        is assumed to be all public, or where the traffic is assumed to
        be all private.
   R3:  The indication from R1 can be removed by a SIP proxy belonging
        to an administrative entity where for onward routeing, the
        traffic no longer needs to be so distinguished.  An example
        exists where the traffic reaches an NGCN site where the traffic
        is now assumed to all private network traffic.  Another example
        is on the final hop to the UA.
   R4:  It is REQUIRED that the indication from R1 allows entities to
        determine the set of rules that are applicable, these rules may
        be enterprise specific.
   R5:  It is REQUIRED that the indication from R1 allows entities
        receiving it to distinguish private network traffic from
        different enterprises.
   R6:  The identifier to distinguish private network traffic belonging
        to one enterprise from that belonging to another enterprise must
        be globally unique.  Business communication arrangements for any
        particular enterprise can be expected to span multiple NGN
        operators potentially in multiple countries.

Internet-Draft         private network indication          February 2008


   R7:  The indication from R1 relates primarily to the SIP signaling.
        Applying the same concept to media may be possible, but is not
        necessarily meaningful where media is routed differently from
        signalling.


5.  Potential solutions

5.1.  General

   It would be technical possible, but extremely complex to perform this
   function without an explicit indication.  For example, a logical
   distinction of proxies to handle private network traffic relating to
   enterprise 1, enterprise 2 and the public network traffic could be
   made by assigning different SIP URIs to these logical entities.  This
   is not regarded as a viable solution.

   Several solutions have been raised and whether or not they are
   suitable and fulfill the requirements need to be discussed:
   o  Attribute on existing header?
   o  Token on some existing header?
   o  Resource-Priority header?
   o  P-Asserted-Service header?
   o  Request-Disposition header?
   o  P-Access-Network-Information header?
   o  URI parameter?
   o  New P-header?
   o  New header?

5.2.  Attribute on existing header

5.3.  Token value on existing header

5.4.  Resource-Priority header

   Some of the distinctive functions are already provided for in this
   header.  A potential mechanism would be to define a namespace for
   private network traffic.  It would however be impossible to define a
   namespace for each enterprise, and therefore some additional
   parameter would need to be defined to carry the unique identifier of
   the particular enterprise to which the private network traffic
   relates.  Successful usage may also require a tightening of the
   procedures for use of the Resource-Priority header (much at the
   moment is left to the particular application of this header).

   Private network traffic may, but is not necessarily handled with a
   different priority then public network traffic.  Use of the Resource-
   Priority header however seems to imply that the main focus of the



van Elburg & Drage       Expires August 25, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         private network indication          February 2008


   indicator is on prioritizing private network traffic.  This may
   render use of the Resource-Priority header as less appropriate for
   our particular purpose.

5.5.  P-Asserted-Service header

   The services envisaged by the P-Asserted-Service header field
   (draft-drage-sipping-service-identification [10]) are those applied
   to the end user.  The end user in these cases is the end user of the
   enterprise or NGCN, not the enterprise itself.  Therefore this header
   is not considered suitable for this problem.

5.6.  Request-Disposition header

   The Request-Disposition header field (RFC3841 [9]) specifies caller
   preferences for how a server should process a request.  The caller in
   these cases is the end user of the enterprise or NGCN, not the
   enterprise itself.  Therefore this header is not considered suitable
   for this problem.  Further RFC3841 explicitly states that the set of
   request disposition directives is not extensible.

5.7.  P-Access-Network-Information

   The P-Access-Network-Info header field (RFC3455 [8]) contains
   information about the access network that a UA uses to get IP
   connectivity.  However the access that one uses does not define the
   private network that a call that one sets up is to be part of.

   Particular examples that illustrate this:
   o  A Hosted Enterprise Services user (i.e.  Centrex) uses the access
      of the operator while still being able to setup calls that will
      turn out to be private network traffic.
   o  A corporate network UE that attaches to an operator network, but
      receives services from its home corporate network.

5.8.  URI parameter

   A marking on the entities within the Via header that are treating
   this as private network traffic.  Potential marking on the route
   header of entities that are expected to treat it as private network
   traffic.

5.9.  New header

5.9.1.  General

   If none of the existing headers is appropriate a logical step is to
   define a new header for the private network indicator.

Internet-Draft         private network indication          February 2008


5.9.2.  Full SIP header field

   A full SIP header is appropriate when the usage of this information
   element is more general then closed networks like ETSI TISPAN NGN or
   3GPP IMS.

5.9.3.  New P-header

   In case no general usage is foreseen other then usage in closed
   networks like those specified by ETSI TISPAN NGN or 3GPP IMS a
   P-header seems the appropriate choice.


6.  Overview of solution

   The mechanism proposed in this document relies on a new header field
   called 'Private-Network-Indication' that contains an private network
   identifier expressed as a domain name, for example:


   Private-Network-Indicator: ericsson.com

   A proxy server which handles a message can, based on authentication
   of the source of a message and configuration or local policy, insert
   such a Private-Network-Indication header field into the message and
   forward it to other trusted proxies to be handled as private network
   traffic.  A proxy that is about to forward a message to a proxy
   server or UA that it does not trust MUST remove the Private-Network-
   Indication header.

   The private network identifier expressed as a domain name allows it
   to be globally unique identifier associated with the enterprise.
   Domain name is used as it allows reuse of a company owned internet
   domain name, without requiring an additional private network
   identifier registry.  When the enterprise needs more then one
   identifier it can freely add subdomains that it has under its own
   control.

   The formal syntax for the Private-Network-Indication header is
   presented in Section 8.


7.  Behaviour

7.1.  UA behaviour

   Use of this extension by UA's is not foreseen.  Therefore there is no
   particular UA behaviour specified in connection to the Private-



van Elburg & Drage       Expires August 25, 2008                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         private network indication          February 2008


   Network-Indication header field.

7.2.  Proxy behaviour

7.2.1.  Private-Network-Indication generation

   Proxies that are responsible for determining certain traffic is to be
   treated as private network traffic or contain a breakin function that
   converts incoming public network traffic to private network traffic
   MUST insert a Private-Network-Indication header field in to requests
   for a dialog or requests for a standalone transaction where the value
   MUST be set to the private network identifier corresponding to the
   enterprise to which the traffic belongs.

   [Whether the indication is useful on responses requires further
   discussion.]

7.2.2.  Private-Network-Indication consumption

   Proxies that are responsible for applying different processing
   behaviours to specific private network traffic as to public network
   traffic MUST support this extension.  The Private-Network-Indication
   header MUST NOT be used by a proxy in case it is received on a
   request it received from an entity that it does not trust.

   [Whether the indication is useful on responses requires further
   discussion.]

7.2.3.  Private-Network-Indication removal

   Proxies that are at the edge of the trustdomain or contain a breakout
   function that converts incoming private network traffic to public
   network traffic MUST remove the Private-Network-Indication header
   field before forwarding a request that contains such a header with a
   value.

   [Whether the indication is useful on responses requires further
   discussion.]


8.  Private-Network-Indicator header field definition

   This document defines the SIP Private-Network-Indicator header.  This
   header field can be added by a proxy to initial requests for a dialog
   or standalone requests.  The presence of the Private-Network-
   Indicator header field signifies to proxies that understand this
   header field that the request is to be treated as private network
   traffic.  The Private-Network-Indicator header field contains a



van Elburg & Drage       Expires August 25, 2008               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         private network indication          February 2008


   domain name value that allows the private network traffic to be
   associated with an enterprise to which it belongs and that allow
   proxies that understand this header to process the request according
   to the request processing behaviours configured for a specific
   enterprise.

   The augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) (RFC5234 [4]) syntax of the
   Private-Network-Indicator header field is the following:


   Private-Network-Indicator =
                          "Private-Network-Indicator" HCOLON PNI-value
                                                      *(SEMI PNI-param)
   PNI-param                 = generic-param
   PNI-value                 = hostname

   EQUAL, HCOLON, SEMI, hostname and generic-param are defined in
   RFC3261 [2].

   The following is an example of a Private-Network-Indicator header
   field:


   Private-Network-Indicator: ericsson.com


9.  Security considerations

   The private network indication being defined in this document is to
   be used in an environment where elements are trusted and where
   attackers are not supposed to have access to the protocol messages
   between those elements.  Traffic protection between network elements
   is sometimes achieved by using IPsec and sometimes by physically
   protecting the network.  In any case, the environment where the
   private network indication will be used ensures the integrity and the
   confidentiality of the contents of this header field.

   A private network indication received from an untrusted node MUST NOT
   be used and the information MUST be removed from a request or
   response before it is forwarded to entities in the trust domain.

   There is a security risk if a private network indication is allowed
   to propagate out of the trust domain where it was generated.  In that
   case sensitive information would be revealed by such a breach.  To
   prevent such a breach from happening: Proxies MUST NOT insert the
   information when forwarding requests to a next hop located outside
   the trust domain.  When forwarding the request to a trusted node,
   proxies MUST NOT insert the header unless they have sufficient

   knowledge that the route set includes another proxy in the trust
   domain that understands the header, such as the own proxy.  There is
   no automatic mechanism to learn the support for this specification.
   Proxies MUST remove the information when forwarding requests to
   untrusted nodes or when the proxy does not have knowledge of any
   other proxy in the route set that is able to understand the header.


10.  IANA considerations

   This document defines a new SIP header field: Private-Network-
   Indicator.  This header field needs to be registered by the IANA in
   the SIP Parameters registry under the Header Fields subregistry.
