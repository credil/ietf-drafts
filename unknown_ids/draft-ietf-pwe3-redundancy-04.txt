Abstract 

   This document describes a framework comprised of a number of 
   scenarios and associated requirements for pseudowire (PW) 
   redundancy. A set of redundant PWs is configured between provider 
   edge (PE) nodes in single segment PW applications, or between 
   Terminating PE nodes in Multi-Segment PW applications. In order for 
   the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW to use for forwarding 
   PW packets to one another, a new PW status is required to indicate 
   the preferential forwarding status of active or standby for each PW 
   in the redundancy set.

1. Introduction 

   The objective of PW redundancy is to provide sparign of attachment 
   circuits (ACs), Provider Edge nodes (PEs), and Pseudowires (PWs) to 
   eliminate single points of failure, while ensuring that only one 
   active path between a pair of Customer Edge nodes (CEs).  

   In single-segment PW (SS-PW) applications, protection for the PW is 
   provided by the PSN layer. This may be a Resource Reservation 
   Protocol with Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) labeled switched path 
   (LSP) with a fast-Reroute (FRR) backup or an end-to-end backup LSP. 
   PSN protection mechanisms cannot protect against failure of the a PE 
   node or the failure of the remote AC. Typically, this is cuported by 
   dual-homing a Cutomer Edge (CE) node to different PE nodes which 
   provide a pseudowire emulated service across the PSN. A set of PW 
   mechanisms is theerfore required that enables a primary and one or 
   more backup backup PWs to terminate on different PE nodes. 

   In multi-segment PW (MS-PW) applications, PSN protection mechanisms 
   cannot protect against the failure of a switching PE (S-PE). A set 
   of mechanisms that support the operation of a primary and one or 
   more backup PWs via a diferent set of S-PEs is therefore required. 
   The paths of these PWs are diverse in the sense that they are 
   switched at different S-PE nodes.  

   In both of these applications, PW redundancy is important to 
   maximise the resiliency of the emulated service.  

   This document describes framework for these applications and its 
   associated operational requirements. The framework utilizes a new PW 
   status, called the Preferential Forwarding Status of the PW. This is 
   separate from the operational states defined in RFC4447 [2]. The 
   mechanisms for PW redundancy are modelled on general protection 
   switching principles. 

    

2. Terminology  

   o UP PW:  A PW which has been configured (label mapping exchanged 
      between PEs) and s not in any of the PW defect states specified 
      in [2]. Such a PW is available for forwarding traffic.

Internet-Draft          Pseudowire Redundancy                July 2011 
    

   o DOWN PW: A PW that has either not been fully configured, or has 
      been configured and is in any one of the PW defect states 
      specified in [2]. Such a PW is not available for forwarding 
      traffic. 

   o Active PW.  An UP PW used for forwarding user, OAM and control 
      plane traffic.  

   o Standby PW. An UP PW that is not used for forwarding user traffic 
      but may forward OAM and specific control plane traffic.  

   o PW Endpoint: A PE where a PW terminates on a point where Native 
      Service Processing is performed, e.g., A Single Segment PW (SS-
      PW) PE, a Multi-Segment Pswudowire (MS-PW) Terminating PE (T-PE), 
      or a Hierarchical VPLS MTU-s or PE-rs. 

   o Primary PW: the PW which a PW endpoint activates (i.e. uses for 
      forwarding) in preference to any other PW when more than one PW 
      qualifies for active state. When the primary PW comes back up 
      after a failure and qualifies for the active state, the PW 
      endpoint always reverts to it. The designation of Primary is 
      performed by local configuration for the PW at the PE.  

   o Secondary PW: when it qualifies for the active state, a Secondary 
      PW is only selected if no Primary PW is configured or if the 
      configured primary PW does not qualify for active state (e.g., is 
      DOWN). By default, a PW in a redundancy PW set is considered 
      secondary. There is no Revertive mechanism among secondary PWs. 

   o Revertive protection switching. Traffic will be carried by 
      primary PW if it is UP and a wait-to-restore timer expires and 
      primary PW is made the Active PW. 

   o Non-revertive protection switching. Traffic will be carried by 
      the last PW  selected as a result of previous active PW entering 
      Operationally DOWN state.   

   o Manual selection of PW. The ability for the operator to manually 
      select the primary/secondary PWs.    

   This document uses the term 'PE' to be synonymous with both PEs as 
           per RFC3985 and T-PEs as per RFC5659.

3. Reference Models  

   Following sections describe show the reference architecture of the 
   PE for PW redundancy and its usage in different topologies and 
   applications. 

    

3.1. PE Architecture 

   Figure 1 shows the PE architecture for PW redundancy, when more than 
   one PW in a redundant set is associated with a single AC. This is 
   based on the architecture in Figure 4b of RFC3985 [3]. The forwarder 
   selects which of the redundant PWs to use based on the criteria 
   described in this document.

3.2. PW Redundancy Network Reference Scenarios 

   This section presents a set of reference scenarios for PW 
   redundancy.  

3.2.1. Single Multi-Homed CE 

   The following figure illustrates an application of single segment 
   pseudowire redundancy. This scenario is designed to protect the 
   emulated service against a failure of one of the PEs or ACs attached 
   to the multi-homed CE. Protection against failures of the PSN 
   tunnels is provided using PSN mechanisms such as MPLS Fast Reroute, 
   so that these failures do not impact the PW. 

   CE1 is dual-homed to PE1 and PE3. A dual homing control protocol, 
   the details of which are outside the scope of this document,  
   selects which AC CE1 should use to forward towards the PSN, and 
   which PE (PE1 or PE3) should forward towards CE1.

            |                                                  | 
            |          |<------- Pseudo Wire ------>|          | 
            |          |                            |          | 
            |          |    |<-- PSN Tunnels-->|    |          | 
            |          V    V                  V    V          | 
            V    AC    +----+                  +----+     AC   V 
      +-----+    |     | PE1|==================|    |     |    +-----+ 
      |     |----------|....|...PW1.(active)...|....|----------|     | 
      |     |          |    |==================|    |          | CE2 | 
      | CE1 |          +----+                  |PE2 |          |     | 
      |     |          +----+                  |    |          +-----+ 
      |     |          |    |==================|    | 
      |     |----------|....|...PW2.(standby)..|    | 
      +-----+    |     | PE3|==================|    | 
                 AC    +----+                  +----+ 
    
               Figure 2 PW Redundancy with one Multi-Homed CE 

   In this scenario, only one of the PWs should be used for forwarding 
   between PE1 / PE3, and PE2. PW redundancy determines which PW to 
   make active based on the forwarding state of the ACs so that only 
   one path is available from CE1 to CE2.

Internet-Draft          Pseudowire Redundancy                July 2011 
    

   Consider the example where the AC from CE1 to PE1 is initially 
   active and the AC from CE1 to PE3 is initially standby. PW1 is made 
   active and PW2 is made standby in order to complete the path to CE2. 

   On failure of the AC between CE1 and PE1, the forwarding state of 
   the AC on PE3 transitions to Active. The preferential forwarding 
   state of PW2 therefore needs to become active, and PW1 standby, in 
   order to reestablish connectivity between CE1 and CE2. PE3 therefore 
   uses PW2 to forward towards CE2, and PE2 uses PW2 instead of PW1 to 
   forward towards CE1. PW redundancy in this scenario requires that 
   the forwarding status of the ACs at PE1 and PE3 be signaled to PE2 
   so that PE2 can choose which PW to make active. 

   Changes occurring on the dual homed side of network due to a failure 
   of the AC or PE are not propagated to the ACs on the other side of 
   the network. Furthermore, failures in the PSN are not be propagated 
   to the attached CEs.  

     

3.2.2. Multiple Multi-homed CEs 

   This scenario, illustrated in Figure 3, is also designed to protect 
   the emulated service against failures of the ACs and failures of the 
   PEs. Here, both CEs, CE1 and CE2, are dual-homed to their respective 
   PEs, PE1 and PE2, and PE3 and PE4. The method used by the CEs to 
   choose which AC to use to forward traffic towards the PSN is 
   determined by a dual-homing control protocol. The details of this 
   protocol are outside the scope of this document.   

   Note that the PSN tunnels are not shown in this figure for clarity. 
   However, it can be assumed that each of the PWs shown is 
   encapsulated in a separate PSN tunnel. Protection against failures 
   of the PSN tunnels is provided using PSN mechanisms such as MPLS 
   Fast Reroute, so that these failures do not impact the PW.

   PW1 and PW4 connect PE1 to PE3 and PE4, respectively. Similarly, PE2 
   has PW2 and PW3 connect PE2 to PE4 and PE3. PW1, PW2, PW3 and PW4 
   are all UP. In order to support N:1 or 1:1 protection, only one PW 
   MUST be selected to forward traffic. This document defines an 
   additional PW that reflects this forwarding state, which is separate 
   from the operational status of the PW. This is the 'Preferential 
   Forwarding Status'.  

   If a PW has a preferential forwarding status of 'active', it can be 
   used for forwarding traffic. The actual UP PW chosen by the combined 
   set of PEs that interconnect the CEs is determined by considering 
   the preferential forwarding status of each PW at each PE. The 
   mechanisms for achieving this selection are outside the scope of 
   this document. Only one PW is used for forwarding.   

   The following failure scenario illsutrates the operation of PW 
   redundancy in Figure 2. In the initial steady state, when there are 
   no failures of the ACs, one of the PWs is chosen as the active PW, 
   and all others are choen as standby. The dual-homing protocol 
   between CE1 and PE1/PE2 chooses to use the AC to PE2, while the 
   protocol between CE2 and PE3/PE4 chooses to use the AC to PE4. 
   Therefore the PW between PE2 and PE4 is chosen as the active PW to 
   complete the path between CE1 and CE2. 

   On failure of the AC between the dual-homed CE1 and PE2, the 
   preferential forwarding status of the PWs at PE1, PE2, PE3 and PE4

   needs to change so as to resestablish a path from CE1 to CE2.  
   Different mechanisms can be used to achieve this and these are 
   beyond the scope of this document. After the change in status the 
   algorithm for selection of PW needs to revaluate and select PW to 
   forward traffic. In this application, each dual-homing algorithm 
   running on the two node sets, i.e., {CE1, PE1, PE2} and {CE2, PE3, 
   PE4}, selects the active AC independently. There is therefore a need 
   to signal the active status of each AC such that the PEs can select 
   a common active PW for forwarding between CE1 and CE2. 

   Changes occurring on one side of network due to a failure of the AC 
   or PE are not propagated to the ACs on the other side of the 
   network. Furthermore, failures in the PSN are not be propagated to 
   the attached CEs.  

   Note that End-to-end native service protection switching can also be 
   used to protect the emulated service in this scenario. In this case, 
   PW3 and PW4 are not necessary.  

    

   If the CEs do not perform native service protection switching, they 
   may instead may use load balancing across the paths between the CEs.  

3.3. Single Homed CE with MS-PW redundancy 

   This application is shown in Figure 4. The main objective is to 
   protect the emulated service against failures of the S-PEs.

   Figure 4 Single homed CE with multi-segment pseudowire redundancy 

   CE1 is connected to PE1 and CE2 to PE2, respectively. There are 
   three multi-segment PWs. PW1 is switched at S-PE1, PW2 is switched 
   at S-PE2, and PW3 is switched at S-PE3. 

   Since there is no multi-homing running on the ACs, the T-PE nodes 
   would advertise 'Active' for the forwarding status based on a 
   priority for the PW. Priorities associate meaning of 'primary PW' 
   and 'secondary PW'. These priorities MUST be used in revertive mode 
   as well and paths must be switched accordingly. The priority can be 
   configuration or derivation from the PWid. Lower the PWid higher the 
   priority. However, this does not guarantee selection of same PW by 
   the T-PEs because, for example, mismatch of the configuration of the 
   PW priority in each T-PE. The intent of this application is to have 
   T-PE1 and T-PE2 synchronize the transmit and receive path of the PW 
   over the network. In other words, both T-PE nodes are required to 
   transmit over the PW segment which is switched by the same S-PE. 
   This is desirable for ease of operation and troubleshooting.

3.4. PW redundancy between MTU-s in H-VPLS

               Figure 5  Multi-homed MTU-s in H-VPLS core                   

   In Figure 5, the MTU-s is dual homed to PE1 and PE2 and has spoke 
   PWs to each of them. The MTU-s needs to choose only one of the spoke 
   PWs ( the active PW) to one of the PE to forward the traffic and the 
   other to standby status. The MTU-s can derive the status of the PWs 
   based on local policy configuration. PE1 and PE2 are connected to 
   the H-VPLS core on the other side of network. The MTU-s communicates 
   the status of its member PWs for a set of VSIs having common status 
   of Active or Standby. Here the MTU-s controls the selection of PWs 
   to forward the traffic. Signaling using PW grouping with a common 
   group-id in PWid FEC Element or Grouping TLV in Generalized PWid FEC 
   Element as defined in [2] to PE1 and PE2 respectively, is 
   RECOMMENDED to scale better.   

   Whenever MTU-s performs a switchover, it needs to communicate to PE2 
   for the Standby PW group the changed status of active. 

   In this scenario, PE devices are aware of switchovers at MTU-s and 
   could generate MAC Withdraw Messages to trigger MAC flushing within 
   the H-VPLS full mesh. By default, MTU-s devices should still trigger 
   MAC Withdraw messages as currently defined in [5] to prevent two 
   copies of MAC withdraws to be sent (one by MTU-s and another one by 
   PEs). Mechanisms to disable MAC Withdraw trigger in certain devices 
   is out of the scope of this document.

3.5. PW redundancy between VPLS n-PEs  

   Following figure illustrates the application of use of PW redundancy 
   for dual homed connectivity between PE devices in a ring topology.

             |  PE3  |=====================|  PE4  |==... 
             +-------+    PW Group 2       +-------+ 
    
                 Figure 6   Redundancy in Ring topology                

   In Figure 6, PE1 and PE3 from VPLS domain A are connected to PE2 and 
   PE4 in VPLS domain B via PW group 1 and group 2. Each of the PEs in 
   the respective domains is connected to each other as well as forming 
   the ring topology. Such scenarios may arise in inter-domain H-VPLS 
   deployments where rapid spanning tree (RSTP) or other mechanisms may 
   be used to maintain loop free connectivity of PW groups. 

   [5] outlines multi-domain VPLS services without specifying how 
   multiple redundant border PEs per domain per VPLS instance can be 
   supported. In the example above, PW group 1 may be blocked at PE1 by 
   RSTP and it is desirable to block the group at PE2 by virtue of 
   exchanging the PW preferential forwarding status of Standby. How the 
   PW grouping should be done here is again deployment specific and is 
   out of scope of the solution.

                         Figure 7   Bridge Module Model 

   In Figure 7, two provider access networks, each having two n-PEs, 
   where the n-PEs are connected via a full mesh of PWs for a given 
   VPLS instance. As shown in the figure, only one n-PE in each access 
   network is serving as a Primary PE (P) for that VPLS instance and 
   the other n-PE is serving as the backup PE (B). In this figure, each 
   primary PE has two active PWs originating from it. Therefore, when a 
   multicast, broadcast, and unknown unicast frame arrives at the 
   primary n-PE from the access network side, the n-PE replicates the 
   frame over both PWs in the core even though it only needs to send 
   the frames over a single PW (shown with == in the figure) to the 
   primary n-PE on the other side. This is an unnecessary replication 
   of the customer frames that consumes core-network bandwidth (half of 
   the frames get discarded at the receiving n-PE). This issue gets 
   aggravated when there is three or more n-PEs per provider, access 
   network. For example if there are three n-PEs or four n-PEs per 
   access network, then 67% or 75% of core-BW for multicast, broadcast 
   and unknown unicast are respectively wasted.   

   In this scenario, n-PEs can disseminate the status of PWs 
   active/standby among themselves and furthermore to have it tied up 
   with the redundancy mechanism such that per VPLS instance the status 
   of active/backup n-PE gets reflected on the corresponding PWs 
   emanating from that n-PE.

4. Generic PW redundancy requirements 

4.1. Protection switching requirements 

   o Protection architecture such as N:1,1:1 or 1+1 can be used. N:1 
      protection case is somewhat inefficient in terms of capacity 
      consumption hence implementations SHOULD support this method 
      while  1:1 being subset and efficient MUST be supported. 1+1 
      protection architecture can be supported but is left for further 
      study. 

   o Non-revertive mode MUST be supported, while revertive mode is an 
      optional one.  

   o Protection switchover can be operator driven like Manual 
      lockout/force switchover or due to signal failure. Both methods 
      MUST be supported and signal failure MUST be given higher 
      priority than any local or far end request. 

4.2.  Operational requirements 

   o (T-)PEs involved in protecting a PW SHOULD automatically discover 
      and attempt to resolve inconsistencies in the configuration of 
      primary/secondary PW.  

   o (T-)PEs involved in protecting a PW SHOULD automatically discover 
      and attempt to resolve inconsistencies in the configuration of 
      revertive/non-revertive protection switching mode.   

   o (T-)PEs that do not automatically discover or resolve 
      inconsistencies in the configuration of primary/secondary, 
      revertive/non-revertive, or other parameters MUST generate an 
      alarm upon detection of an inconsistent configuration.  

   o (T-)PEs involved with protection switching MUST support the 
      configuration of revertive or non-revertive protection switching 
      mode. 

   o (T-)PEs involved with protection switching SHOULD support the 
      local invocation of protection switching. 

   o (T-)PEs involved with protection switching SHOULD support the 
      local invocation of a lockout of protection switching.

   o In standby status PW can still receive packets in order to avoid 
      black holing of in-flight packets during switchover. However in 
      case of use of VPLS application packets are dropped in standby 
      status except for the OAM packets.   

    

5. Security Considerations  

   This document expects extensions to LDP that are needed for 
   protecting pseudo-wires. It will have the same security properties 
   as in LDP [4] and the PW control protocol [2]. 

6. IANA considerations 

   This document has no actions for IANA.
