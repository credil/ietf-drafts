Internet-Draft         RADIUS Attributes for PKMv1         February 2010


1.  Introduction

   Privacy Key Management Version 1 (PKMv1) [IEEE.802.16-2004] is a
   public-key based authentication and key establishment protocol
   typically used in fixed wireless broadband network deployments.  The
   protocol utilizes X.509 v3 certificates [RFC2459], RSA encryption
   [RFC2437] and a variety of secret key cryptographic methods to allow
   an 802.16 Base Station (BS) to authenticate a Subscriber Station (SS)
   and perform key establishment and maintenance between a SS and BS.

   This document defines a set of RADIUS Attributes which are designed
   to provide support for PKMv1.  The target audience for this document
   consists of those developers implementing RADIUS support for PKMv1;
   therefore, familiarity with both RADIUS [RFC2865] and the IEEE
   802.16-2004 standard is assumed.

   Discussion of this draft may be directed to the author.

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Attributes for PKMv1         February 2010


3.  Attributes

   The following subsections describe the Attributes defined by this
   document.  This specification concerns the following values:

      <TBD1> PKM-SS-Cert

      <TBD2> PKM-CA-Cert

      <TBD3> PKM-Config-Settings

      <TBD4> PKM-Cryptosuite-List

      <TBD5> PKM-SAID

      <TBD6> PKM-SA-Descriptor

      <TBD7> PKM-Auth-Key

3.1.  PKM-SS-Cert

   Description

      The PKM-SS-Cert Attribute is variable length and MAY be
      transmitted in the Access-Request message.  The Value field is of
      type String and contains the X.509 certificate [RFC2459] binding a
      public key to the identifier of the Subscriber Station.

      It is possible that the size of the SS certificate may exceed the
      maximum size of a RADIUS attribute; in this case, the client MUST
      encapsulate the certificate in the Value fields of two or more
      instances of the PKM-SS-Cert Attribute, each (except possibly the
      last) having a length of 255 octets.  These multiple PKM-SS-Cert
      Attributes MUST appear consecutively and in order within the
      packet.  Upon receipt, the RADIUS server MUST recover the original
      certificate by concatenating the Value fields of the received PKM-
      SS-Cert Attributes in order.

   A summary of the PKM-SS-Cert Attribute format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Type

      <TBD1> for PKM-SS-Cert

   Len

      > 2

   Value

      The Value field is variable length and contains a (possibly
      complete) portion of an X.509 certificate.

3.2.  PKM-CA-Cert

   Description

      The PKM-CA-Cert Attribute is variable length and MAY be
      transmitted in the Access-Request message.  The Value field is of
      type String and contains the X.509 certificate [RFC2459] used by
      the CA to sign the SS certificate carried in the PKM-SS-Cert
      attribute (Section 3.1) in the same message.

      It is possible that the size of the CA certificate may exceed the
      maximum size of a RADIUS attribute; in this case, the client MUST
      encapsulate the certificate in the Value fields of two or more
      instances of the PKM-CA-Cert Attribute, each (except possibly the
      last) having a length of 255 octets.  These multiple PKM-CA-Cert
      Attributes MUST appear consecutively and in order within the
      packet.  Upon receipt, the RADIUS server MUST recover the original
      certificate by concatenating the Value fields of the received PKM-
      CA-Cert Attributes in order.

   A summary of the PKM-CA-Cert Attribute format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Value

      The Value field is variable length and contains a (possibly
      complete) portion of an X.509 certificate.

3.3.  PKM-Config-Settings

   Description

      The PKM-Config-Settings Attribute is of type "string" [RFC2865].
      It is 30 octets in length and consists of seven independent
      fields, each of which is conceptually an unsigned integer.  Each
      of the fields contains a timeout value and corresponds to a Type-
      Length-Value (TLV) tuple encapsulated in the IEEE 802.16 "PKM
      configuration settings" attribute; for details on the contents of
      each field, see Section 11.9.19 of [IEEE.802.16-2004] One instance
      of the PKM-Config-Settings Attribute MAY be included in the
      Access-Accept message.

   A summary of the PKM-Config-Settings Attribute format is shown below.
   The fields are transmitted from left to right.

      802.16 "PKM configuration settings" attribute

3.4.  PKM-Cryptosuite-List

   Description

      The PKM-Cryptosuite-List Attribute is of type "string" [RFC2865]
      and is variable length; it corresponds roughly to the
      "Cryptographic-Suite-List" 802.16 attribute (see Section 11.19.15
      of [IEEE.802.16-2004], the difference being that the RADIUS
      Attribute contains only the list of 3-octet cryptographic suite
      identifiers, omitting the IEEE Type and Length fields.

      The PKM-Cryptosuite-List Attribute MAY be present in an Access-
      Request message.  Any message in which the PKM-Cryptosuite-List
      Attribute is present MUST also contain an instance of the Message-
      Authenticator Attribute [RFC3579].

      Implementation Note

         The PKM-Cryptosuite-List Attribute is used as a building block
         to create the 802.16 "Security-Capabilities" attribute
         ([IEEE.802.16-2004], Section 11.9.13); since this document only
         pertains to PKM version 1, the "Version" sub-attribute in that
         structure MUST be set to 0x01 when the RADIUS client constructs
         it.

   A summary of the PKM-Cryptosuite-List Attribute format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Value

      The Value field is variable length and contains a sequence of one
      or more cryptosuite identifiers, each of which is 3 octets in
      length and corresponds to the Value field of an IEEE 802.16
      Cryptographic-Suite attribute

3.5.  PKM-SAID

   Description

      The PKM-SAID Attribute is of type "string" [RFC2865].  It is 4
      octets in length and contains a PKM Security Association
      Identifier ([IEEE.802.16-2004], Section 11.9.7).  It MAY be
      included in an Access-Request message.

   Description

      The PKM-SA-Descriptor Attribute is of type "string" and is 8
      octets in length.  It contains three fields, described below,
      which together specify the characteristics of a PKM security
      association.  One or more instances of the PKM-SA-Descriptor

3.7.  PKM-AUTH-Key

   Description

      The PKM-AUTH-Key Attribute is of type "string", 135 octets in
      length.  It consists of 3 fields, described below, which together
      specify the characteristics of a PKM authorization key.  The PKM-
      AUTH-Key Attribute MAY occur in an Access-Accept message.  Any
      packet that contains an instance of the PKM-AUTH-Key Attribute
      MUST also contain an instance of the Message-Authenticator
      Attribute [RFC3579].

   A summary of the PKM-AUTH-Key Attribute format is shown below.  The

   Lifetime

      The Lifetime field is 4 octets in length and represents the
      lifetime, in seconds, of the authorization key.  For more
      information, see Section 11.9.4 of [IEEE.802.16-2004].

   Sequence

      The Sequence field is one octet in length.  The contents
      correspond to those of the Value field of an IEEE 802.16 Key-
      Sequence-Number attribute (see [IEEE.802.16-2004], Section
      11.9.5).

   Key

      The Key field is 128 octets in length.  The contents correspond to
      those of the Value field of an IEEE 802.16 AUTH-Key attribute.
      The Key field MUST be encrypted under the public key from the
      Subscriber Station certificate (Section 3.1) using RSA encryption
      [RFC2437]; see Section 7.5 of [IEEE.802.16-2004] for further
      details.


4.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   [Note 1]
      No more than one Subscriber Station Certificate may be transferred
      in an Access-Request packet.

   [Note 2]
      No more than one CA Certificate may be transferred in an Access-
      Request packet.

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.

   0   This attribute MUST NOT be present in packet
   0+  Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in packet
   0-1 Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present in packet
   1   Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present in packet


5.  Diameter Considerations

   Since the Attributes defined in this document are allocated from the
   standard RADIUS type space (see Section 6), no special handling is
   required by Diameter nodes.


6.  IANA Considerations

   Upon publication of this document as an RFC, IANA must assign numbers
   for the following Attributes:

      <TBD1> PKM-SS-Cert

      <TBD2> PKM-CA-Cert

      <TBD3> PKM-Auth-Wait-Timeout

      <TBD4> PKM-Cryptosuite-List

      <TBD5> PKM-SAID

      <TBD6> PKM-SA-Descriptor

      <TBD7> PKM-Auth-Key

   The Attribute numbers are to be allocated from the standard RADIUS
   Attribute type space according to the "IETF Review" policy [RFC5226].


7.  Security Considerations

   Section 4 of RFC 3579 [RFC3579] discusses vulnerabilities of the
   RADIUS protocol.

   Section 3 of the paper "Security Enhancements for Privacy and Key
   Management Protocol in IEEE 802.16e-2005" [SecEn] discusses the
   operation and vulnerabilities of the PKMv1 protocol.

   If the Access-Request message is not subject to strong integrity
   protection, an attacker may be able to modify the contents of the
   PKM-Cryptosuite-List Attribute, weakening 802.16 security or
   disabling data encryption altogether.

   If the Access-Accept message is not subject to strong integrity
   protection, an attacker may be able to modify the contents of the
   PKM-Auth-Key Attribute.  For example, the Key field could be replaced
   with a key known to the attacker.

   Although it is necessary for a plaintext copy of the Key field in the
   PKM-AUTH-Key Attribute to be transmitted in the Access-Accept
   message, this document does not define a method for doing so
   securely.  In order to transfer the key securely, it is RECOMMENDED
   that it be encapsulated in an instance of the MS-MPPE-Send-Key
   Attribute [RFC2548]; however, see Section 4.3.4 of RFC 3579 [RFC3579]
   for details regarding weaknesses in the encryption scheme used.
