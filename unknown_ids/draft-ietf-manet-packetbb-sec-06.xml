      <t>
      	This document describes general and flexible TLVs (type-length-value structure) for representing cryptographic signatures as well as timestamps, using the generalized MANET packet/message format <xref target="RFC5444"/>. It defines two Packet TLVs, two Message TLVs, and two Address Block TLVs, for affixing cryptographic signatures and timestamps to a packet, message and address, respectively.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        This document specifies:
        
        <list style="symbols">
        	<t>
        		two TLVs for carrying cryptographic signatures and timestamps in packets, messages, and address blocks as defined by <xref target="RFC5444"/>,
        	</t>
        	<t>
        		a generic framework for calculating cryptographic signatures, accounting (for Message TLVs) for mutable message header fields (&lt;msg-hop-limit&gt; and &lt;msg-hop-count&gt;),  where these fields are present in messages.
        	</t>
        </list>

        This document requests from IANA:
        <list style="symbols">
        	<t>
        		allocations for these Packet, Message, and Address Block TLVs from the 0-223 Packet TLV range, the 0-127 Message TLV range and the 0-127 Address Block TLV range from <xref target="RFC5444"/>,
        	</t>
        	<t>
        		creation of two IANA registries for recording code points for hash function and signature calculation, respectively.
        	</t>
        </list>

        Finally, this document defines, in <xref target="decomposition"/>:
        <list style="symbols">
        	<t>
        		one common method for generating signatures as a cryptographic function, calculated  over the hash value of the content to be signed.

      	The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
        <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
      </t>

      <t>This document uses the terminology and notation defined in  <xref target="RFC5444"/>. In particular, the following TLV fields from <xref target="RFC5444"/> are used in this specification:
	
		<list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="&lt;msg-hop-limit&gt;"> -  hop limit of a message, as specified in Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC5444"/>.</t>
			<t hangText="&lt;msg-hop-count&gt;"> -  hop count of a message, as specified in Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC5444"/>.</t>
			<t hangText="&lt;length&gt;"> -  length of a TLV in octets, as specified in Section 5.4.1 of <xref target="RFC5444"/>.</t>
		</list>
		</t>	

      
    </section>

    <section title="Applicability Statement" anchor="applStatement">
		<t>
      		MANET routing protocols using the format defined in <xref target="RFC5444"/> are accorded the ability to carry additional information in control messages and packets, through inclusion of TLVs. Information so included MAY be used by a MANET routing protocol, or by an extension of a MANET routing protocol, according to its specification.
		</t>
		<t>
			This document specifies how to include a cryptographic signature for a packet, a message, and addresses in address blocks within a message, by way of such TLVs.  This document also specifies how to treat "mutable" fields, specifically the &lt;msg-hop-count&gt; and &lt;msg-hop-limit&gt; fields, if present in the message header when calculating signatures, such that the resulting signature can be correctly verified by any recipient, and how to include this signature.
		</t>
		<t>
			This document describes a generic framework for creating signatures, and how to include these signatures in TLVs. In <xref target="decomposition"/>,  an example method for calculating such signatures is given, using a cryptographic function over the hash value of the content to be signed.
		</t>
	</section>
	
	
	<section title="Security Architecture">
		<t>
			Basic MANET routing protocol specifications are often "oblivious to security", however have a clause allowing a control message to be rejected as "badly formed" prior to it being processed or forwarded. MANET routing protocols such as <xref target="RFC6130"/> and <xref target="OLSRv2"/> recognize external reasons (such as failure to verify a signature)  for rejecting a message as "badly formed", and therefore "invalid for processing". This architecture is a result of the observation that with respect to security in MANETs, "one size rarely fits all" and that MANET routing protocol deployment domains have varying security requirements ranging from "unbreakable" to "virtually none". The virtue of this approach is that MANET routing protocol specifications (and implementations) can remain "generic", with extensions providing proper deployment-domain specific security mechanisms.
		</t>
		<t>
			The MANET routing protocol "security architecture", in which this specification situates itself, can therefore be summarized as follows:
			
			<list style="symbols">
				<t> 
					Security-oblivious MANET routing protocol specifications, with a clause allowing an extension to reject a message (prior to processing/forwarding) as "badly formed".
				</t>
				<t>
					MANET routing protocol security extensions, rejecting messages as "badly formed", as appropriate for a given deployment-domain specific security requirement.
				</t>
				<t>
					Code-points and an exchange format for information, necessary for specification of such MANET routing protocol security extensions.
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		<t>
			This document addresses the last of these issues, by specifying a common exchange format for cryptographic signatures, making reservations from within the Packet TLV, Message TLV, and Address Block TLV registries of <xref target="RFC5444"/>, to be used (and shared) among MANET routing protocol security extensions.
		</t>	
		<t>
			For the specific decomposition of a signature into a cryptographic function over a hash value, specified in <xref target="decomposition"/>, this document establishes two IANA registries for code-points for hash functions and cryptographic functions adhering to <xref target="RFC5444"/>.
		</t>
		
		
		<t>
			With respect to <xref target="RFC5444"/>, this document:
			<list style="symbols">
				<t>is intended to be used in the non-normative, but intended,  mode of use described in Appendix B of <xref target="RFC5444"/>.</t>
				<t>is a specific example of the Security Considerations section of <xref target="RFC5444"/> (the authentication part).</t>

    <section title="Overview and Functioning" anchor="overview">
      <t>      	
      	This document specifies a syntactical representation of security related information for use with <xref target="RFC5444"/> addresses, messages, and packets, as well as establishes IANA registrations and registries.
      </t>
      <t>      	
      	Moreover, this document provides guidelines how MANET routing protocols and MANET routing protocol extensions, using this specification, should treat Signature and Timestamp TLVs, and mutable fields in messages. This specification does not represent a stand-alone protocol; MANET routing protocols and MANET routing protocol extensions, using this specification, MUST provide instructions as to how to handle packets, messages and addresses with security information, associated as specified in this document.
      </t>
      <t>
      	This document requests assignment of TLV types from the registries defined for Packet, Message and Address Block TLVs in <xref target="RFC5444"/>. When a TLV type is assigned from one of these registries, a registry for "Type Extensions" for that TLV type is created by IANA. This document utilizes these "Type Extension" registries so created, in order to specify internal structure (and accompanying processing) of the &lt;value&gt; field of a TLV.      	
      </t>
      <t>
		For example, and as defined in this document, a SIGNATURE TLV with Type Extension = 0 specifies that the &lt;value&gt; field has no pre-defined internal structure, but is simply a sequence of octets. A SIGNATURE TLV with Type Extension = 1 specifies that the &lt;value&gt; field has a pre-defined internal structure, and defines its interpretation (specifically, the &lt;value&gt; field consists of a cryptographic operation over a hash value, with fields indicating which hash function and cryptographic operation has been used, specified in <xref target="decomposition"/>). 
	  </t>
	  <t>
		Other documents may request assignments for other Type Extensions, and must if so specify their internal structure (if any) and interpretation.

			Note that this does not stipulate how to calculate the &lt;signature-value&gt;, nor the internal structure hereof, if any; such MUST be specified by way of the Type Extension for the SIGNATURE TLV type, see <xref target="IANA"/>.

		</t>
	</list>
	
	 A timestamp is essentially "freshness information".  As such, its setting and interpretation is to be determined by the MANET routing protocol, or MANET routing protocol extension, that uses the timestamp, and may, e.g., correspond to a UNIX-timestamp, GPS timestamp or a simple sequence number.

<section title="Signature: Basic" anchor="simple">
	<t>
		The basic signature proposed, represented by way of a SIGNATURE TLV with Type Extension = 0, is a simple bit-field containing the cryptographic signature. This assumes that the mechanism stipulating how signatures are calculated and verified is established outside of this specification, e.g., by way of administrative configuration or external out-of-band signaling. Thus, the &lt;signature-value&gt; for when using Type Extension = 0 is:

			<t hangText="&lt;cryptographic-function&gt;"> is an 8-bit unsigned integer field specifying the cryptographic function.
			</t>
			<t hangText="&lt;key-index&gt;"> is an 8-bit unsigned integer field specifying the key index of the key which was used to sign the message, which allows unique identification of different keys with the same originator.  It is the responsibility of each key              originator to make sure that actively used keys that it               issues have distinct key indices and that all key indices               have a value not equal to 0x00.  The value 0x00 is reserved for               a pre-installed, shared key.

			<t hangText="&lt;signature-data&gt;"> is an unsigned integer field, whose length is &lt;length&gt; - 3, and which contains the cryptographic signature.
			</t>

		The version of this TLV, specified in this section, assumes that calculating the signature can be decomposed into:
			<list style="hanging">
				<t>signature-value = cryptographic-function(hash-function(content))</t>
			</list>
			
		The hash function and the cryptographic function correspond to the entries in two IANA registries, set up by this specification in <xref target="IANA"/>. 
		</t>



		<section title="Rationale" anchor="rationale">
		
			<t>
			The rationale for separating the hash function and the cryptographic function into two octets instead of having all combinations in a single octet - possibly as TLV type extension - is twofold: 
			First, if further hash functions or cryptographic functions are added in the future, the number space might not remain continuous.  More importantly, the number space of possible combinations would be rapidly exhausted.<!--: 16 different hash functions and 16 different cryptographic functions would lead to exhaustion. --> As new or improved cryptographic mechanism are continuously being developed and introduced, this format should be able to accommodate such for the foreseeable future.
			</t>
			
			<t>
			The rationale for not including a field that lists parameters of the cryptographic signature in the TLV is, that before being able to validate a cryptographic signature, routers have to exchange or acquire keys (e.g. public keys). Any additional parameters can be provided together with the keys in that bootstrap process. It is therefore not necessary, and would even entail an extra overhead, to transmit the parameters within every message.
			
			One implicitly available parameter is the length of the signature, which is &lt;length&gt; - 3, and which depends on the choice of the cryptographic function.

			When determining the &lt;signature-value&gt; for a Packet, the signature is calculated over the three fields &lt;hash-function&gt;, &lt;cryptographic-function&gt; and &lt;key-index&gt; (in that order), concatenated with the entire Packet, including the packet header, all Packet TLVs (other than Packet SIGNATURE TLVs) and all included Messages and their message headers, in accordance with <xref target="packetsignatureTLV"/>.

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
      	This document does not specify a protocol. It provides a syntactical component for cryptographic signatures of messages and packets as defined in <xref target="RFC5444"/>. It can be used to address security issues of a MANET routing protocol or MANET routing protocol extension. As such, it has the same security considerations as <xref target="RFC5444"/>.</t>
      	
      	<t>In addition, a MANET routing protocol or MANET routing protocol extension that uses this specification MUST specify the usage as well as the security that is attained by the cryptographic signatures of a message or a packet.</t>
      	
      	<t>As an example, a MANET routing protocol that uses this component to reject "badly formed" messages if a control message does not contain a valid signature, SHOULD indicate the security assumption that if the signature is valid, the message is considered valid. It also SHOULD indicate the security issues that are counteracted by this measure (e.g. link or identity spoofing) as well as the issues that are not counteracted (e.g. compromised keys).
