     1. Introduction 

        This document shows the message flows associated with the most 
        relevant SPEERMINT routing architecture peering scenarios. Most of 
        the message diagrams were based on previous work described within 
        existing IETF standards documents.  

        The document focuses on the messages exchanged for the purpose of 
        Layer 5 peering [7] between two domains.  Messages exchanged for the 
        purpose of setting up SIP sessions within a domain are considered out 
        of scope and are already defined in other IETF documents.   

     2. Definitions 

        SSP: SIP Service Provider, the administrative entity providing SIP 
             services utilizing SIP.  Note that an SSP may be a traditional 
             Service Provider, an Enterprise, or any administrative domain 
             context. 
         
        LUF: Look-Up Function, the functional step(s) necessary to determine 
             for a given SIP request, which terminating domain it should be 
             sent to. 
         
        LRF: Location Routing Function, the functional step(s) necessary to 
             determine for a given SIP request's terminating domain, the path 
             to follow to reach the terminating domain. 
         
        Routing: In the context of this document, it is forwarding of an out-
             of-dialog SIP request. 
         
        SED: Session Establishment Data, the LUF and LRF data needed and used 
             to route a SIP request to the next-hop(s) associated with 
             reaching the terminating domain. 
         
        SBE: Signaling-path Border Element, the SIP node that represents the 
             logical boundaries between SSP domains (a.k.a., the signaling 
             portion of an SBC, I-BCF, etc.). 
         
        DBE: Data-path Border Element, the node that relays media between the 
             logical boundaries of SSP domains (a.k.a., the media portion of 
             an SBC, I-BGF, etc.). 
         

     3. Peering Scenarios 

        This draft separates the Layer 5 peering scenarios into two major    
        peering scenarios.

        o  On-demand: In this scenario the SIP proxies in domains A and B 
           establish a peering relationship driven by the necessity to 
           deliver a SIP message to another domain, without a pre-existing 
           relation ship.  This is sometimes referred as the "email" model.   

        o  Static: In this scenario the peering relationship between proxies 
           A and B is statically pre-provisioned independent of the 
           establishment of any SIP session between users in different 
           domains.  

        Normally, media for a given SIP session follows a different path from 
        signaling, only following the IP routed transport path when crossing 
        peering domains.  Alternatively, media for a given session can be 
        directed to traverse the same SIP device used for Layer 5 peering, 
        i.e., the same device that handles signaling when crossing domains. 
        This produces three different models:  

        o  Media-direct: In this model SIP proxies perform Layer 5 peering, 
           while media is sent directly between the User Agent's (UA's) 
           involved in the session, as shown in Figure 1.  Therefore 
           signaling and media follow different paths.  

        o  Integrated: In this model, the device that performs Layer 5 SIP 
           peering also processes the associated media when crossing domains, 
           as shown in Figure 2.  This function is usually referred to as 
           media relay and is usually performed by a B2BUA or SBC (Session 
           Border Controller), called an SBE in this document.  See [6] for a 
           complete discussion of SBC functions.  We will refer to this 
           picture throughout this document.   
        o  Decomposed: In this model, media is relayed by a Data Border 
           Element which is physically separated from the SBE.  A control 
           protocol, typically H.248 or MGCP, is used by the SBE to control 
           the DBE.  From the UA and peering domain's perspective, the 
           decomposed SBE and DBE do not function any differently than an 
           integrated SBC.  For the purposes of this document, one can 
           consider this model as just a variant of the integrated.

        In a decomposed model, the signaling function (SF) and the media 
        function (MF) are implemented in separate entities. A B2BUA is 
        generally on the SIP path in the SF. The vertical control protocol 
        between the SF and MF is out of the scope of this document. The 
        decomposed model is shown below:

     4. Basic Peering Message Flow 

        This section depicts the "basic" Peering message flow.  This does not 
        imply this is the most common peering scenario - just a baseline.  
        The various scenarios differ mostly of how and when peering is 
        implemented. As stated earlier, peering can be establish dynamically

        In the integrated model, media would follow the path shown below. All 
        other signaling call flows remain the same, except a B2BUA is used 
        instead of a proxy.

        The following sections show the message flows in several different 
        scenarios broken in two categories: on-demand and static.   

     5. On-Demand Peering 

        In the on-demand peering scenario, the relationship between proxies 
        in domains A and B is driven by the arrival of a SIP message at proxy 
        A directed to a user in domain B (or vice-versa). 

     5.1. Transport Layer Security  

        In case this is in fact the first SIP request between two SSPs in an 
        on-demand peering relationship, then the SIP request will trigger the 
        establishment of the TLS connection.  Otherwise it is assumed the TLS 
        connection has been established by some other means and may be 
        reused.

     6. Static Peering 

        In the static peering scenario the relationship between proxies A and 
        B is not driven by a SIP request, but before-hand through manual 
        provisioning. 

     6.1. TLS  

        In this model a TLS connection between proxies A and B is provisioned 
        following an agreement between the two domains.  Creation of the TLS 
        connection may be established through previous SIP message exchanges, 
        or by continuous message exchange such as OPTIONS requests/responses.  
        If Mutual-TLS is used, reverse-path requests may use the same 
        connection as defined in [13], or separate TLS connections may be 
        used for each request direction.

     6.2. IPSec  

        In this model an IPSec connection between proxies A and B is 
        provisioned following an agreement between the two domains.  
        Typically either transport-mode ESP is used for SIP signaling only, 
        or tunnel-mode is used for both signaling and media.  If tunneling is 
        used, media-relay must be performed as described later.

     6.3. Co-Location  

        In this scenario the two proxies are co-located in a physically 
        secure location and/or are members of a segregated network, such as a 
        VPN. In this case messages between Proxy 1 and Proxy 2 would be sent 
        as clear text.

     7. Federation Based Peering 

        Multiple SSP's may be members of the same Federation, such that their 
        policies and relationships are defined to be the same for a given 
        federation.  Federations are one way for a source and destination 
        network to find a common set of procedures for peering. 

     7.1. Central Federation Proxy 

        Federation rules can dictate that calls are to be routed via a 
        federation-maintained central SIP proxy. In that case no further 
        NAPTR/SRV/A lookups are made. Instead, the INVITE will be sent 
        directly via a preconfigured connection to that proxy. This proxy 
        acts as a redirect proxy.

     7.2. TLS Based Federation 

        One of the simplest cases is a TLS based federation. 

        In that case the federation rules may prescribe the default NAPTR/SRV 
        lookups and only affect the selection of the correct X.509 
        certificate for the TLS connection. 

     8. Media Relay  

        In the event that a source and/or destination SSP are part of a 
        private network, or peer through a private network, the SSP peers

        must enable the SIP signaling and media to route between the peers.  
        This process is implemented by an SBE and DBE, either in an 
        integrated or decomposed model.  The core of the process is media 
        relaying, whereby the SBE forces the relay of media through its DBE 
        by modifying the SDP.   

      
     9. Peering Message Flow Phases 

        The message flow phases are Discovery, Security Establishment, 
        Signaling Exchange, and Media Exchange.  The following flow provides 
        an overview of the phases.  Each of the phases is described 
        individually in the following subsections.  For the following 
        diagram, the signaling and media exchange phase descriptions have 
        been omitted for clarity purposes, because their functionality has 
        not changed for the purposes of peering.  However, they have been 
        explained further in the following subsections.

     9.1. Discovery Phase 

        The first phase of static or dynamic peering requests is discovery.  
        The discovery process can be summarized by querying the Location 
        Routing Function (LRF) to determine the next phase in the message 
        flow.  The discovery phase can take place via a local or external 
        federation location function.  Examples of the function may be 
        comprised of an ENUM/DNS or redirect server.  After the discovery 
        phase has completed, the peering process will progress to a 
        subsequent phase, usually the policy or authentication phase.  The 
        following message flows provide examples of the discovery phase.

        The signaling exchange phase is a necessary step to progress towards 
        establishing peering.  This phase may incorporate the security 
        exchange phase, but it is not required.  This phase follows standard 
        methods described in [2], so the following flow provides an example 
        of this phase, but does not incorporate all possibilities.

     10. Security Considerations 

        The level of security required during the establishment and 
        maintenance of a SIP peering relationship between two proxies can 
        vary greatly. In general all security considerations related to the 
        SIP protocol are also applicable in a peering relationship.  

        If the two proxies communicate over an insecure network, and   
        consequently are subject to attacks, the use of TLS or IPSec would be 
        advisable.  

        If there is physical security and the proxies are co-located, or the 
        proxies are situated in a segregated network (such as a VPN), one 
        could argue that basic filtering based on IP address is enough.
