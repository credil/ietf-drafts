   Abstract 

      Currently OSPFv3 uses IPsec for authenticating the protocol 
      packets. There however are some environments (mobile ad-hoc), 
      where IPsec is difficult to configure and maintain, and this 
      mechanism cannot be used. This draft proposes an alternative 
      mechanism that can be used so that OSPFv3 does not depend upon 
      IPsec for security.

   1. Introduction 

      Unlike OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) Version 2 [RFC2328] OSPF 
      for IPv6 (OSPFv3) [RFC5340], does not have Auth Type and 
      Authentication fields in its headers for authenticating the 
      protocol packets. It instead relies on the IPv6 Authentication 
      Header (AH) [RFC4302] and IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload 
      (ESP) [RFC4303] to provide integrity, authentication, and/or 
      confidentiality.

      [RFC4552] describes how IPv6 AH/ESP extension headers can be 
      used to provide authentication/confidentiality to OSPFv3. 
       
      There however are some environments (mobile ad-hoc), where IPsec 
      is difficult to configure and maintain, and this mechanism 
      cannot be used. There is also an issue with IPsec not being 
      available on some platforms or it requiring some additional 
      license which may be expensive. 
       
      [RFC4552] discusses, at length, the reasoning behind using 
      manually configured keys, rather than some automated key 
      management protocol such as IKEv2 [RFC5996]. The primary problem 
      is the lack of suitable key management mechanism, as OSPF 
      adjacencies are formed on a one-to-many basis and most key 
      management mechanisms are designed for a one-to-one 
      communication model. This forces the system administrator to use 
      manually configured security associations (SAs) and 
      cryptographic keys to provide the authentication and, if 
      desired, confidentiality services. 
       
      Regarding replay protection [RFC4552] states that: 
       
         As it is not possible as per the current standards to provide 
         complete replay protection while using manual keying, the  
         proposed solution will not provide protection against replay  
         attacks. 
       
      Since there is no replay protection provided there are a number 
      of vulnerabilities in OSPFv3 which have been discussed in 
      [crypto-issues]. 
       
      OSPFv3 uses IPsec for data integrity and rarely employs it for 
      confidentiality, therefore [RFC4552] mandates the use of ESP-
      NULL. 
       
      Since there is no deterministic way to differentiate between 
      encrypted and unencrypted ESP packets by simply examining the 
      packet, it could become tricky for some implementations to 
      prioritize certain OSPFv3 packets (Hellos for example) over the 
      others. 
       
      This draft proposes a new mechanism that works similar to OSPFv2 
      for providing authentication to the OSPFv3 packets and attempts 
      to solve the problems described above for OSPFv3. 
       
      Additionally this document describes how HMAC-SHA authentication 
      can be used for OSPFv3.

      By definition, HMAC ([RFC2104], [FIPS-198]) requires a 
      cryptographic hash function. This document proposes to use any 
      one of SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 [FIPS-180-3] to 
      authenticate the OSPFv3 packets. 
       
       
      It is believed that [RFC2104] is mathematically identical to 
      [FIPS-198] and it is also believed that algorithms in [RFC4634] 
      are mathematically identical to [FIPS-180-3]. 
       
   2. Basic Operation 

      The OSPFv3 authentication information is appended to the OSPFv3 
      packet and is not actually considered part of the OSPFv3 protocol 
      packet. Thus the authentication information is not included in 
      the OSPFv3 header's packet length, but is instead included in the 
      IPv6 packet's payload length. 

      This is very similar to how the message digest is carried in the 
      OSPFv2 packet. The only difference between this mechanism and 
      OSPFv2's authentication mechanism is that for OSPFv3 we carry 
      some more authentication information in addition to the message 
      digest. The additional information carried is detailed in the 
      next section. 

      Packet format before applying Authentication: 
       
            +----------------+-----------------+     
            |orig IP header  | OSPFv3  Payload |                
            |(any options)   |                 | 
            +----------------+-----------------+ 
       

      Packet format after applying Authentication: 
       
            +----------------+----------------+-----------------+     
            |orig IP header  | OSPFv3 Payload | Authentication  |                
            |(any options)   |                |     Trailer     | 
            +----------------+----------------+-----------------+ 
       
      The procedure followed for computing the Authentication trailer 
      is exactly the same as described in [RFC5709] and [RFC2328].

   3. OSPFv3 Security Association 

      An OSPFv3 Security Association contains a set of parameters 
      shared between any two legitimate OSPFv3 speakers.  
       
      Parameters associated with an OSPFv3 SA: 
       
      Key Identifier (Key ID) 
       
      This is a 32-bit unsigned integer used to uniquely identify an 
      OSPFV3 SA, as manually configured by the network operator.  
       
      The receiver determines the active SA by looking at the Key ID 
      field in the incoming protocol packet.  
       
      The sender based on the active configuration, selects the 
      Security Association to use and puts the correct Key ID value 
      associated with the Security Association in the OSPFV3 protocol 
      packet. If multiple valid and active OSPFV3 Security 
      Associations exist for a given outbound interface at the time an 
      OSPFV3 packet is sent, the sender may use any of those security 
      associations to protect the packet. 
       
      Using Key IDs makes changing keys while maintaining protocol 
      operation convenient. Each key ID specifies two independent 
      parts, the authentication protocol and the authentication key, 
      as explained below.  
       
      Normally, an implementation would allow the network operator to 
      configure a set of keys in a key chain, with each key in the 
      chain having fixed lifetime. The actual operation of these 
      mechanisms is outside the scope of this document. 
       
      Note that each key ID can indicate a key with a different 
      authentication protocol. This allows multiple authentication 
      mechanisms to be used at various times without disrupting an  
      OSPFv3 peering, including the introduction of new authentication 
      mechanisms.  
       
      Authentication Algorithm 
       
      This signifies the authentication algorithm to be used with the 
      OSPFv3 SA. This information is never sent in cleartext over the 
      wire. Because this information is not sent on the wire, the 
      implementer chooses an implementation specific representation 
      for this information.

      At present, the following values are possible:  
       
      HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384 and HMAC-SHA-512. 
       
      Authentication Key 
       
      This value denotes the cryptographic authentication key 
      associated with the OSPFv3 SA. The length of this key is 
      variable and depends upon the authentication algorithm specified 
      by the OSPFv3 SA.  
       
       
   4. Authentication Procedure 

   4.1. Authentication Trailer 

      The authentication trailer that is appended to the OSPFv3 
      protocol packet is described below: 
       
   0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                                                               | 
   |                Authentication Data (Variable)                 | 
   ~                                                               ~ 
   |                                                               | 
   |                                                               |

                                  Figure 1 
       
      The idea is to keep the fields as similar as possible with 
      OSPFv2 so that most of the source code can be reused for 
      authenticating the OSPFv3 protocol packets. 
       
      The various fields in the Authentication trailer are: 
       
      Reserved 
       
      16-bit reserved field. The value MUST be initialized to zero by 
      the sender, and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

      32-bit field that identifies the algorithm and the secret key

      Authentication Data 
       
      Variable data that is carrying the digest of the protocol 
      packet. 
       
   4.2. Cryptographic Authentication Procedure 

      As noted earlier the algorithms used to generate and verify the 
      message digest are specified implicitly by the secret key. This 
      specification discusses the computation of OSPFv3 Cryptographic 
      Authentication data when any of the NIST SHS family of 
      algorithms is used in the Hashed Message Authentication Code 
      (HMAC) mode.  
       
      The currently valid algorithms (including mode) for OSPFv3 
      Cryptographic Authentication include: 
                  
                 HMAC-SHA-1               
                 HMAC-SHA-256             
                 HMAC-SHA-384             
                 HMAC-SHA-512             
       
      Of the above, implementations of this specification MUST include 
      support for at least: 
       
             HMAC-SHA-256 
       
      and SHOULD include support for: 
       
             HMAC-SHA-1 
       
      and MAY also include support for: 
       
             HMAC-SHA-384 
             HMAC-SHA-512

   4.3. Cryptographic Aspects 

      In the algorithm description below, the following nomenclature, 
      which is consistent with [FIPS-198], is used: 
       
      H is the specific hashing algorithm (e.g. SHA-256). 
       
      K is the Authentication Key for the OSPFv3 security association. 
        
      Ko is the cryptographic key used with the hash algorithm. 
       
      B is the block size of H, measured in octets rather than bits. 
       
      Note that B is the internal block size, not the hash size. 
       
           For SHA-1 and SHA-256:   B == 64 
           For SHA-384 and SHA-512: B == 128 
       
      L is the length of the hash, measured in octets rather than 
      bits. 
       
      XOR is the exclusive-or operation. 
      Opad is the hexadecimal value 0x5c repeated B times. 
      Ipad is the hexadecimal value 0x36 repeated B times. 
      Apad is the hexadecimal value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L/4) times. 
       
      Implementation Note: 
       
      This definition of Apad means that Apad is always the same 
      length as the hash output. 
       
      (1)Preparation of the Key 
    
         In this application, Ko is always L octets long. 
       
         If the Authentication Key (K) is L octets long, then Ko is  
         equal to K.  If the Authentication Key (K) is more than L  
         octets long, then Ko is set to H(K).  If the Authentication  
         Key (K) is less than L octets long, then Ko is set to the  
         Authentication Key (K) with zeros appended to the end of the  
         Authentication Key (K) such that Ko is L octets long. 
       
      (2)First Hash 
       
         First, the OSPFv3 packet's Authentication Trailer (which is  
         very similar to the appendage described in RFC 2328, Section  
         D.4.3, Page 233, items(6)(a) and (6)(d)) is filled with the  
         value Apad.

   Internet-Draft                                       September 2010 
       

    
         Then, a First-Hash, also known as the inner hash, is computed  
         as follows: 
       
               First-Hash = H(Ko XOR Ipad || (OSPFv3 Packet)) 
       
         Implementation Notes: 
       
             Note that the First-Hash above includes the  
             Authentication Trailer containing the Apad value, as well  
             as the OSPFv3 packet, as per RFC 2328, Section D.4.3. 
       
         The definition of Apad (above) ensures it is always the same 
         length as the hash output.  This is consistent with RFC 2328. 
         The "(OSPFv3 Packet)" mentioned in the First-Hash (above)  
         does include the OSPF Authentication Trailer. 
       
       
         The digest length for SHA-1 is 20 bytes; for SHA-256, 32  
         bytes; for SHA-384, 48 bytes; and for SHA-512, 64 bytes. 
       
      (3)Second Hash 
       
         Then a second hash, also known as the outer hash, is  
         computed as follows: 
       
                 Second-Hash = H(Ko XOR Opad || First-Hash) 
       
      (4)Result 
       
         The resulting Second-Hash becomes the authentication data  
         that is sent in the Authentication Trailer of the OSPFv3  
         packet. The length of the authentication data is always  
         identical to the message digest size of the specific hash  
         function H that is being used. 
       
         This also means that the use of hash functions with larger  
         output sizes will also increase the size of the OSPFv3 packet  
         as transmitted on the wire. 
       
         Implementation Note: 
       
            RFC 2328, Appendix D specifies that the Authentication  
            Trailer is not counted in the OSPF packet's own Length  
            field, but is included in the packet's IP Length field. 
            Similar to this, the Authentication Trailer is not  
            included in OSPFv3's own Length field, but is included 
            in IPv6's payload length.

   4.4. Message Verification 

      An incoming router would implicitly know that OSPFv3 non IPsec 
      cryptographic authentication is in use if it finds that the 
      length indicated by the IPv6 header is more than the packet 
      length given in the OSPFv3 header. 
       
      Authentication algorithm dependent processing needs to be  
      performed, using the algorithm specified by the appropriate  
      OSPFv3 SA for the received packet. 
       
      Before an implementation performs any processing it needs to 
      save the values of the Authentication data field from the 
      Authentication trailer appended to the OSPFv3 packet. 
       
      It should then set the Authentication data field with Apad 
      before the authentication data is computed. The calculated data 
      is compared with the received authentication data in the 
      Authentication trailer and the packet is discarded if the two do 
      not match. In such a case, an error event SHOULD be logged. 
       
      An implementation MAY have a transition mode where it includes 
      the Authentication Trailer in the packets but does not verify 
      this information. This is provided as a transition aid for 
      networks in the process of migrating to the mechanism described 
      in this draft. 
       
   5. Security Considerations 

      The document proposes extensions to OSPFv3 which would make it 
      more secure than what it is today. It does not provide 
      confidentiality as a routing protocol contains information  
      that does not need to be kept secret. It does, however, provide 
      means to authenticate the sender of the packets which is of 
      interest to us. 
       
      It should be noted that authentication method described in this 
      document is not being used to authenticate the specific 
      originator of a packet, but is rather being used to confirm that 
      the packet has indeed been issued by a router which had access 
      to the password. 
       
      The mechanism described here is not perfect and does not need to 
      be perfect. Instead, this mechanism represents a significant 
      increase in the work function of an adversary attacking the 
      OSPFv3 protocol, while not causing undue implementation, 
      deployment, or operational complexity.

      There is a transition mode suggested where routers can ignore 
      the Generic Authentication extension header information carried 
      in the protocol packets. The operator must ensure that this mode 
      is only used when migrating to the new Generic Authentication 
      based scheme as this leaves the router vulnerable to an attack. 
       
       
   6. IANA Considerations 

      The Generic Authentication extension header number is assigned 
      by IANA out of the IP Protocol Number space (and as recorded at 
      the IANA web page at  
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers) is: TBD.
