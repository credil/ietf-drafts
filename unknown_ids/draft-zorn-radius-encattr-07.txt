Internet-Draft             Encrypted Attributes            December 2007


1.  Introduction

   Certain applications of the RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] require the
   content (at least, if not the type and length) of one or more
   Attributes in a message be encrypted.  For example, an application
   enabling the interception of certain packets by law enforcement
   agencies might require that it be impossible for an observer to
   distinguish between sessions which are under surveillance and those
   that are not.  If packet interception is enabled and disabled using
   RADIUS (via the Access-Accept [RFC2865] or CoA-Request [RFC3576]
   messages, for example) then the Attributes used to signal this must
   be encrypted; however, it might be acceptable for the remainder of
   the Attributes to be sent in cleartext.

   Currently, this type of transfer is usually accomplished using either
   the Tunnel-Password Attribute [RFC2868] or vendor-specific RADIUS
   attributes.  However, there are several issues with these techniques:

   o  The Tunnel-Password Attribute was not designed to carry entire
      RADIUS Attributes and it is not large enough to hold an Attribute
      of the maximum size

   o  The security properties and strength of the encryption method used
      to hide the contents of the Tunnel-Password Attribute are unknown

   o  Due to its dependency upon the random Request Authenticator in the
      Access-Request message [RFC2865], the Tunnel-Password Attribute
      cannot be used in messages other than Access-Accept

   o  Although vendor-specific Attributes may not share the problems
      outlined above, a profusion of different attributes used for the
      same purpose entails considerable multiplication of effort and
      makes interoperability difficult to achieve

   This document defines RADIUS Attributes that can be used to
   encapsulate and confidentially transfer one or more RADIUS Attributes
   using non-proprietary techniques with well-understood security
   properties.

   Discussion of this draft may be directed to the authors.

3.  Attributes

   The following subsections describe the Attributes defined by this
   document.  This specification concerns the following values:

      [TBD1] Crypto-Params

      [TBD2] Encrypted-Attribute

3.1.  Crypto-Params

   Description

      This Attribute is used to carry data used during the encryption
      and decryption of the Attribute(s) encapsulated in the Encrypted-
      Attribute Attribute, specifically the initialization vector and
      algorithm identifier.

      Any packet that contains an Crypto-Params Attribute MUST also
      contain a Message-Authentication-Code Attribute [KEYWRAP] and
      SHOULD contain one or more instances of the Encrypted-Attribute
      Attribute.

      A summary of the Crypto-Params attribute format is shown below.
      The fields are transmitted from left to right.

Internet-Draft             Encrypted Attributes            December 2007


      Length

         >=19

      Enc Type

         The Enc Type field is 1 octet in length and serves to identify
         the encryption algorithm in use.  This document defines the
         following decimal values for this field:

            0 NULL

            1 AES-CBC-128 [FIPS-197-2001]

            2 AES-CBC-192 [FIPS-197-2001]

            3 AES-CBC-256 [FIPS-197-2001]

         Implementations MUST support Enc Types 0 and 1 (NULL and AES-
         CBC-128).  Other values are to be assigned by IANA.

      Key ID

         The Key ID field is 16 octets in length and contains an
         identifier for the key used to encrypt and decrypt the String
         field of the Encrypted-Attribute Attribute (section 3.2).
         Further specification of the content of this field is outside
         the scope of this document.

      IV

         The IV field is variable length and contains the initialization
         vector.  The length of the IV field depends upon the algorithm
         specified in the Enc Type field (above); for the algorithms
         defined in this document, the length of the IV field is 16
         octets.  If no initialization vector is required by the
         algorithm specified by the Enc Type field, this field MAY be
         omitted.

3.2.  Encrypted-Attribute

   Description

      This Attribute MAY be used to carry one or more encrypted
      Attributes in a RADIUS message.

      Any packet that contains an Encrypted-Attribute Attribute MUST
      also include both a Crypto-Params Attribute (section 3.1) and a

      Message-Authentication-Code Attribute [KEYWRAP].

      The encryption of the Attribute(s) MUST be performed by the sender
      according to the following algorithm:

         Concatenate the Attributes to be encrypted.  If the algorithm
         specified by the Enc Type field of the Crypto-Params Attribute
         is a block cipher and the length in octets of the result is not
         an even multiple of the algorithm's block size, pad the result
         of the concatenation on the right with enough zero-value octets
         to make the resulting string an even multiple of the block size
         in length.  Encrypt the result using the algorithm specified by
         the Enc Type field and the initialization vector contained in
         the IV field of the Crypto-Params Attribute (section 3.1).
         Split the resulting ciphertext into one or more chunks, each <=
         253 octets in length.  Encapsulate each chunk in a separate
         instance of the Encrypted-Attribute Attribute.

      The receiver MUST recover the plaintext Attribute(s) using the
      following algorithm:

         Concatenate the String fields of the received Encrypted-
         Attribute Attributes in order of reception.  Decrypt the result
         using the algorithm specified in the Enc Type field and the
         initialization vector contained in the IV field of the Crypto-
         Params Attribute (section 3.1).  Split the resulting cleartext
         in to Attributes, discarding the padding (if any).

      A subset of the attributes in a message can be authenticated and
      integrity-protected by setting the Enc Type field in the Crypto-
      Params Attribute (section 3.1) to NULL and concatenating an
      instance of the Message-Authentication-Code Attribute [KEYWRAP] to
      the set of attributes to be protected.  When used in this way,
      only the attributes to be protected are to be used as input in the
      creation of the Message-Authentication-Code Attribute.

      The Encrypted-Attribute Attribute MUST NOT be used to transfer
      keys between RADIUS servers and clients.

      A summary of the Encrypted-Attribute attribute format is shown
      below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

         [TBD2] for Encrypted-Attribute

      Length

      String

         The String field is variable length and contains the actual
         encrypted Attributes (see above).


4.  IANA Considerations

   This section explains the criteria to be used by the IANA for
   assignment of numbers within namespaces defined within this document.
   The "Specification Required" policy is used here with the meaning
   defined in BCP 26 [RFC2434].

4.1.  Attribute Types

   Upon publication of this document as an RFC, IANA must assign numbers
   to the Crypto-Params and Encrypted-Attribute Attributes.

4.2.  Attribute Values

   As defined in Section 3.1, numbers may need to be assigned for future
   values of the Enc Type field of the Crypto-Params attribute.  These
   numbers may be assigned by applying the "Specification Required"
   policy.


5.  Security Considerations

   Although the encryption algorithms specified in this document are
   believed to be strong, ultimately the confidentiality of the
   encrypted attributes depends upon the strength of the keys used to
   encrypt them.  For this reason, implementations SHOULD use keys with
   entropy equal to or greater than the strength of the algorithm used
   (e.g., 128 bits of entropy for AES-CBC-128, etc.).

   Given that the secret shared between RADIUS clients and servers
   typically has relatively weak entropy, it is NOT RECOMMENDED that
   implementations use the shared secret (or a derivative thereof) as a
