Internet-Draft             DHCP Authentication                March 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document defines DHCP Options and procedures that allow for an
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication exchange to
   occur in DHCP in order to enable smooth migration from Point-to-Point
   Protocol (PPP)[RFC1661] sessions to IP sessions in a DSL Broadband
   network environment.  Primary goals are integration of authentication
   in such a way that it will operate seamlessly with existing RADIUS-
   based Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA)
   infrastructure and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Ethernet based
   DSL Networks.  As such, only the termination points of PPP in the DSL
   network are affected, both of which are devices that would logically
   need to be updated in any transition from PPP to IP sessions.

   It should be noted that [RFC3118] defines a mechanism that provides
   authentication of individual DHCP messages.  While this mechanism
   does provide a method of authentication for a DHCP Client based on a
   shared secret, it does not do so in a manner that can be seamlessly
   integrated with existing RADIUS-based AAA infrastructure.


2.  Problem Statement

   Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) broadband service providers are
   witnessing a shift in the "last-mile" aggregation technologies and
   protocols which have traditionally been relied upon.  Two primary
   transitions are from ATM to Ethernet in the access network, and from
   the PPP for multi-protocol framing and dynamic endpoint configuration
   to direct encapsulation of IP and DHCP for dynamic endpoint
   configuration for some devices.  The term used by the DSL Forum for
   the network state associated with an authorized subscriber (that is
   using DHCP and IP rather than PPP) is "IP session" [WT-146].  While
   these trends can be readily witnessed, neither are occurring
   overnight.  In addition, they are not necessarily implemented in
   lock-step.  Thus, one may find ATM-based and Ethernet-based access
   networks running a combination of PPP sessions and IP sessions at any
   given time, particularly during transition periods.  This
   coexistences will even occur for the same service subscriber.

   Removing PPP, Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA) [RFC2364], and
   Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) [RFC2516] from the
   subscriber access network is relatively straightforward in that most
   of the properties that DSL providers are interested in going forward
   are already present in DHCP and IP sessions.  Luckily, there are some
   capabilities of PPP which the market does not continue to demand.
   For example, the Dynamic configuration in PPP for IPX or NETBEUI, is
   no longer of concern.  Neither are the multi-link bonding
   capabilities of PPP [RFC1990] commonly used on separate ISDN

   B-channels, and the myriad of other features that PPP developed as
   the "dial-based" access protocol of choice for framing,
   authentication, and dynamic configuration for IP and other network
   layer protocols.  Missing from IP sessions and DHCP [RFC2131],
   however, are isomorphic methods for user authentication and session
   liveness probing (sometimes referred to as a session "keepalive").
   For the latter, existence of a client using a given IP address can be
   detected by a number of means, including Address Resolution Protocol
   (ARP) [RFC0826], ICMP Echo/Echo Response [RFC0792], or Bidirectional
   Forwarding Detection (BFD) [I-D.ietf-bfd-base].  This leaves
   authentication as an open issue needing resolution.  Specifically,
   authentication based on a username and secret password must be
   covered.  This is something that in PPP always occurs before dynamic
   configuration of an IP address and associated parameters.

   While most DSL deployments utilize a username and password to
   authenticate a subscriber and authorize access today, this is not the
   only method for authentication that has been adopted when moving to
   DHCP and IP sessions.  "Option 82" [RFC3046] is commonly used with
   DHCP as a credential to authenticate a given subscriber line and
   authorize service.  In this model, the DSL Access Node, which always
   sits between the DHCP Client and Server, snoops DHCP messages as they
   pass, and inserts pre-configured information for a given line (e.g.,
   an ATM VPI/VCI, Ethernet VLAN, or other tag).  That information,
   while provided in clear text, traverses what is considered a
   physically secured portion of the access network and is used to
   determine (typically via a request to an AAA server) whether the DHCP
   exchange can continue.  This fits quite well with current DSL network
   architecture, as long as the subscriber line itself is all that needs
   be authorized.  However, in some service models it is still necessary
   for the subscriber to provide credentials directly.

   From the perspective of the Network Access Server (NAS) where the
   DHCP Server resides, the extensions defined in this document are
   analogous to the commonly available "Option 82" method.  The primary
   difference between using Option 82 line configuration and a username
   and password is that the authentication credentials are provided by
   the subscriber rather than inserted by intervening network equipment.
   Providing credentials from the subscriber rather than intervening
   network equipment is particularly important for cases where
   subscriber line information is unavailable, untrusted, or due to the
   terms of the service changing at any time.  Further, different
   devices in the home may have different policies and require different
   credentials.  Migration scenarios where PPPoE and DHCP operate on the
   same network for a period of time lend well to models which utilize
   identical authentication and authorization credentials across the
   different data plane encapsulations.

3.  Network Architecture and Terminology

   The DSL Forum defines its ATM-based network architecture in [TR-059]
   and Ethernet-based network architecture in [TR-101].  The extensions
   for DHCP defined in this document are designed to work identically on
   Ethernet or ATM architectures.  The diagram in Figure 1 and following
   terminology will be used throughout:

                    Figure 1: DSL Network Architecture

   o  Access Node (AN): Network device, usually located at a service
      provider central office or street cabinet, that terminates Access
      Loop connections from Subscribers.  In case the Access Loop is a
      Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), this is often referred to as a DSL
      Access Multiplexer (DSLAM).  The AN may support one or more Access
      Loop technologies and allow them to inter-work with a common
      aggregation network technology.

   o  Network Access Server (NAS): Network device that aggregates
      multiplexed Subscriber traffic from a number of Access Nodes.  The
      NAS plays a central role in per-subscriber policy enforcement and
      QoS.  Often referred to as a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) or
      Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS).  A detailed definition of
      the NAS is given in [RFC2881].

   o  The Home Gateway (HGW) connects the different Customer Premises
      Equipment (CPE) to the Access Node and the access network.  In
      case of DSL, the HGW is a DSL Network Termination (NT) that could
      either operate as a layer 2 bridge or as a layer 3 router.  In the
      latter case, such a device is also referred to as a Routing
      Gateway (RG).

   o  Referring to the DSL network architecture depicted in Figure 1,
      PPP (via PPPoA [RFC2364] or PPPoE [RFC2516]) operates over the DSL
      Access Network between the NAS and a device behind the HGW, or
      between the NAS and the HGW itself.  The DHCP Client resides
      either on a home network device or the HGW, and the DHCP Server
      protocol state machine may reside fully on the NAS.  The NAS
      obtains per-subscriber client configuration information either
      locally, relayed from a DHCP server or from the AAA infrastructure
      (which itself may consult external DHCP servers if necessary)
      after authentication is successfully completed.


4.  Applicability Statement

   The primary target for this extension is for DSL service provider
   networks where PPP is being phased out to be replaced by native IP
   and DHCP, or where new devices are being added which will not utilize
   PPP.  Very specific assumptions have been made with respect to the
   security model, operational methods, and integration requirements for
   existing AAA mechanisms during the design.  It is understood that
   this mechanism may not be generally applicable in this form for all
   network environments where DHCP is deployed, though perhaps elements
   of it may be used to develop a more generic approach while still
   meeting the specific requirements set out by the DSL network
   architecture.  Earlier revisions of this document included a method
   to embed PPP CHAP [RFC1994] authentication as Options in existing
   DHCP messages.  This method has been abandoned due to security
   vulnerabilities in CHAP, as well as a lack of extensibility.  This
   document bases its authentication on EAP [RFC3748] which can be used
   with a large number of different authentication methods, including
   one backwards compatible with existing PPP CHAP.


5.  Protocol Operation

   This section describes the protocol operation for EAP within DHCPv4
   [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315].  Options and message specifications
   used in these operation descriptions are detailed in later sections.

   If multiple DHCP exchanges are occurring with multiple servers, both
   IPv4 and IPv6 each needs to authenticate separately.

5.1.  Protocol Operation for IPv4

   It is essential that the user/node authentication occurs before the
   assignment of an IP address and, further, that the assignment of the
   address depends upon the details of the successful authentication. .
   DHCP [RFC2131] is widely used as an address assignment method (among



Pruss & Zorn            Expires September 7, 2009               [Page 6]

   other things); EAP [RFC3748] has been widely adapted for
   authentication purposes, especially in those types of networks where
   DHCP is also used.  This section describes how to combine the two in
   order to provide both strong authentication and authenticated address
   assignment in an efficient manner.

   A DHCPEAP message (using the DHCP Vendor-specific Message
   [I-D.volz-dhc-dhcpv4-vendor-message]) is used in the DHCP message
   flow to support the new EAP phase which occurs before a DHCPOFFER is
   sent by the Server.  This message is used to integrate authentication
   methods supported by EAP, including CHAP and any other "in the clear"
   password mechanisms (for example, to support One-Time Password
   mechanisms), or to carry other EAP methods.  EAP is widely used in
   other environments, outside of DSL Broadband, including 802.11
   "Wi-Fi" access networks and 3GPP to name a few.

   To request the assignment of an IPv4 address with authentication, a
   client first locates a DHCP server, then authenticates using EAP and
   then requests the assignment of an address and other configuration
   information from the server.  The client sends a DHCPDISCOVER message
   with an option specifying that the client understands the DHCP User
   Authentication protocol using EAP, to find an available DHCP server.
   Any server that can that can authenticate and address it responds
   with a DHCPEAP message containing the first packet of the EAP
   protocol.

   Servers which support DHCP User Authentication will respond with a
   DHCPEAP message.  The client may receive one or more DHCPEAP messages
   from one or more DHCP Servers or DHCP relays.  The Client may also
   receive one or more DHCPOFFER messages from other DHCP Servers which
   may not understand, or choose not to employ the DHCP User
   Authentication protocol.  The Client chooses one server to reply to.
   If the selected server has sent a DHCPEAP message, then the Client
   will send a DHCPEAP message in reply.  The DHCPEAP message contains
   EAP packets which facilitate the EAP authentication exchange.  The
   exchange may occur between the DHCP Client and DHCP Server embedded
   within a NAS, or be carried transparently to the AAA Server.  Upon
   successful completion of the authentication phase, the DHCP server
   sends a DHCPOFFER with the appropriate IP configuration for the
   authenticated user.  The client then follows the normal DHCP
   procedures of a successful DHCP exchange by sending a DHCPREQUEST,
   followed by a DHCPACK from the Server.

   If the authentication phase fails the DHCP server may choose to
   either terminate all communication with a client or offer some
   default address possibly with some limited access policy.
   (Configuration policy for this is outside of the scope of this
   document).

   The final EAP-Success or EAP-Failure message is always communicated
   using the DHCPEAP message type.  If the Server will be sending a
   DHCPOFFER message, this message is sent immediately after the final
   DHCPEAP message.

   A typical message flow proceeds as shown in Figure 2: The
   retransmission is handled by EAP as per Section 4.1 in [RFC3748].

   The message exchange presented in Figure 2 is an example of simple
   one-way user authentication, e.g. the Server verifies the credentials
   of the HGW Client.  The client indicates the ability to have an EAP
   exchange and the NAS (which takes on the EAP authenticator role)
   initiates the first EAP request to the DHCP Client (which takes on
   the EAP peer role).

   When the NAS is acting as a DHCP Relay the BRAS may split the EAP
   Messages from DHCP and perform the AAA authentication with an AAA
   server.  This allows use of existing DHCP servers and existing AAA
   servers.

   An example message flow for DHCP Relay proceeds as shown in Figure 3:

      Figure 3: DHCP Authentication Message Flow with DHCP relay NAS

   When the DHCP relay agent in the NAS receives a DHCP message from the
   client, it MAY append a DHCP Relay Agent Information option
   containing the RADIUS Attributes suboption, along with any other
   suboptions it is configured to supply.  The RADIUS Attributes
   suboption is defined in [RFC4014].

   DHCP Authentication uses one suboption inside the Vendor-identifying
   vendor-specific message option and makes use of the Vendor-specific
   Message option[I-D.volz-dhc-dhcpv4-vendor-message]:

   o  DHCPEAP Capability Vendor-identifying Vendor-specific Suboption in
      the DHCPDISCOVER to specify the type of authentication exchange
      and makes use of a new DHCP Vendor-specific Message type

   o  DHCPv4 DHCPEAP Message type to carry the EAP data in the DHCPEAP
      messages.

5.2.  Protocol Operation for IPv6

   This section describes the protocol operation for extending Dynamic
   Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 [RFC3315] for an EAP phase.

   The same as the previous section on extending DHCP in IPv4 a new DHCP
   message, DHCPEAP is used to support EAP authentication before host
   configuration occurs.  The mechanisms described here follow a similar
   methodology as that for DHCPv4 described in Section 5.1.

   The client sends a Solicit message with an Option specifying the
   session authentication protocol as EAP to the
   All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers address to find available DHCP
   servers.  Any server that can authenticate and address it responds
   with a DHCPEAP message.

   The client may receive one or more DHCPEAP messages from one or more
   DHCP Servers.  The Client chooses one to reply to, and sends a
   DHCPEAP message, silently discarding DHCPEAP messages from other
   Servers (??  As per the question above, is there some type of EAP
   message which can be sent to the other servers to stop EAP there?).
   The DHCPEAP messages contain EAP packets which facilitate the EAP
   authentication exchange.  The exchange may occur between the DHCP
   Client and DHCP Server embedded within a NAS, or be carried
   transparently to the AAA Server.  Upon successful completion of the
   authentication phase, the DHCP server sends a ADVERTISE with the
   appropriate configuration for the authenticated user.  The client
   then follows the normal DHCP procedures of a successful DHCP exchange
   by sending a REQUEST, followed by an ACK from the Server.

   If the authentication phase fails (e.g., the user does not provide
   appropriate credentials), then according to configured policy the
   DHCP Client is either denied any IP configuration with the DHCP
   Server sending a NAK accordingly, or the DHCP Client is given a
   "limited access" configuration profile and the DHCP exchange
   continues as if the authentication was successful.

   A typical message flow proceeds as shown in Figure 4:

   The retransmission is handled by EAP as per Section 4.1 in [RFC3748].

   When the NAS is acting as a DHCPv6 Relay the BRAS may split the EAP
   Messages from DHCP and perform the AAA authentication with an AAA
   server.  This allows use of existing DHCPv6 servers and existing AAA

         Figure 5: Message Flow with new message and a DHCP relay

   When the DHCP relay agent in the NAS receives a DHCP message from the
   client, it MAY append a DHCP Relay option or DHCP relay information
   suboption containing the RADIUS Attributes information, along with
   any other relay options or relay information suboptions it is
   configured to supply.  The RADIUS Attributes suboption for DHCPv4 is
   defined in [RFC4014]


6.  DHCP Options

   One DHCP Vendor-specific suboption is defined in this section.  The
   DHCPEAP Capability Vendor-identifying Vendor-specific Suboption is
   included into the client's DHCPDISCOVER or SOLICIT message to specify
   that the client understand DHCPEAP messages, as defined below(see
   (Section 8)).

6.1.  DHCPEAP Capability Vendor-identifying Vendor-specific Suboption

   The DHCPv4 DHCPEAP-Capability Vendor-identifying Vendor-specific
   suboption is sent from the DHCPv4 Client to the DHCPv4 Server to
   indicate that the client is capable of understanding DHCPv4 DHCPEAP
   Messages.  This suboption is defined using the DHCPv4 Vendor-
   identifying Vendor-specific option:

                      Figure 8: DHCPEAP Message type

      Vendor-msg: TBD

      Enterprise-ID: 9 (Cisco Systems)

      Msg-type: 1 (DHCPEAP)

      Suboption: 1 (DHCPEAP-Message)

      EAP-length: (length of the EAP message)

   Note that according to the current DHCPv4 Vendor-specific Message
   draft, a "vendor-msg-type" field is the first octet after the
   enterprise-ID, and after this octet all data should be in "code/
   length/value" fields "identical to the DHCP options field".  Thus,
   the "vendor-msg-type" field ("Msg-type" in the figure above) is set
   to "1" and the next field is the suboption value, which is also set
   to "1", followed one octet specifying the length of the EAP message,
   followed by the EAP message itself.

   The maximum size of a DHCP option is 255 octets.  While in some cases
   (e.g., EAP MD5-Challenge [RFC3748]) a complete EAP message may fit in
   a single DHCP option, in general this is not the case.  If an EAP
   message is too large to fit into a single DHCP Vendor-specific
   Message option, the method defined in [RFC3396] MUST be used to split
   the EAP message into separate options for transmission.  Similarly,
   EAP assumes a minimum MTU of 1020 octets while the minimum DHCP
   packet size is 576 octets, including 312 octets reserved for options.
   A DHCP client including the EAP-Message option SHOULD also include
   the 'maximum DHCP message size' option [RFC2132] to set a suitable
   DHCP message size.

   If a DHCP message is received containing more than one DHCPEAP
   Message type option, the method defined in [RFC3396] MUST be used to
   reassemble the separate options into the original EAP message.  A
   DHCP server receiving an EAP message MAY forward it via a AAA
   protocol (such as RADIUS [RFC2865] [RFC3579] or Diameter [RFC3588]]
   [RFC4072]).

7.2.  DHCPv6 DHCPEAP Message

   The format of the DHCPEAP Message type for DHCPv6 follows the current
   draft [I-D.volz-dhc-dhcpv6-vendor-message], and is defined as

8.  Messages for EAP operation

   This section describes the overall DHCP message contents for all
   messages which are used in implementing the DHCP EAP User
   Authentication extensions.

8.1.  Messages for DHCPv4

   The authentication data in a DHCPv4 DHCPEAP message is carried in a
   DHCPEAP-Messsage type DHCPv4 DHCPEAP Message type.

8.1.1.  Client's DHCPDISCOVER message

   As shown in DHCP Message Flow with DHCPEAP messages the DHCP Client
   starts the process by sending the DISCOVER to the MAC broadcast
   address.: The NAS that handles this request could be a DHCP server or
   a relay DHCP.  As per [RFC3579] the NAS can send the initial EAP-
   Request to the client or the NAS can send an EAP-Start to the server.
   The diagrams in this draft assume the NAS sends the initial EAP-
   Reqest as [RFC3579] reads as if that is the recommended behaviour.

8.2.  Messages for DHCPv6

   The DHCPEAP messages for DHCPv6 follow the format for DHCP messages
   defined in RFC 2131 [RFC2131] and is identified by the presence of a
   vendor specific DHCP Message Type option as per
   [I-D.volz-dhc-dhcpv6-vendor-message], which encodes DHCPEAP message
   type.

8.2.1.  Client's SOLICIT message

   As shown in DHCP IPv6 with DHCPEAP message the DHCP Client starts the
   process by sending the SOLICIT to the
   All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.  The NAS that
   handles this request could be a DHCP server or a relay DHCP.  As per
   [RFC3579] the NAS can send the initial EAP-Request to the client or
   the NAS can send an EAP-Start to the server.  The diagrams in this
   draft assume the NAS sends the initial EAP-Reqest as [RFC3579] reads
   as if that is the recommended behaviour.

9.  Fragmentaion

   Encapsulating EAP messages within DHCP raises the question of whether
   there are potential difficulties with respect to the MTU sizes of the
   EAP and DHCP messages, as well as the underlying link MTU.

   EAP as defined in [RFC3748] Section 3.1 says:

   [4] Minimum MTU.  EAP is capable of functioning on lower layers that
   provide an EAP MTU size of 1020 octets or greater.

   DHCP as defined in [RFC2131] Section 2 says:

   ...  This requirement implies that a DHCP client must be prepared to
   receive a message of up to 576 octets, the minimum IP datagram size
   an IP host must be prepared to accept [3].  DHCP clients may
   negotiate the use of larger DHCP messages through the 'maximum DHCP
   message size' option.  The options field may be further extended into
   the 'file' and 'sname' fields.

   If we assume EAP MTU-sized packets, the overhead to pack an EAP
   packet into DHCP options is 2*(1020/255), or 8 octets.  Adding the
   DHCP header (240 octets), UDP (8 octets), and the IP header (20
   octets) gives 278 octets total overhead.  Since the Ethernet
   effective MTU is 1500 octets, this 278 octet overhead leaves the DHCP

Internet-Draft             DHCP Authentication                March 2009


   protocol with 1222 octets to carry EAP.  This space is over 200
   octets more than the EAP MTU of 1020 octets.

   If we add the SNAME and CHADDR fields to the option pool, then there
   are nearly 400 octets available for DHCP options in an Ethernet MTU-
   sized DHCP packet, encapsulating EAP.

   In short, when the 'maximum DHCP message size' option is used by the
   client, there is no problem carrying in EAP over DHCP. i.e. clients
   capable of performing EAP over DHCP should also advertise a maximum
   message that is capable of carrying EAP over DHCP.


10.  Backwards Compatibility Considerations

   This section is aimed at describing interoperability scenarios
   involving HGW and NAS with or without DHCP Authentication mechanism
   support in order to analyze compatibility issues that could be faced
   between newer and older products during the introduction of the DHCP
   Authentication functionally in current implemented network
   environments.

   Scenario 1: Both HGW and NAS do not support DHCP Authentication

   In this case the authentication process does not start, thus
   traditional DHCP message flow applies.

   Scenario 2: HGW does not support DHCP Authentication and NAS supports
   DHCP Authentication

   In this case the DHCP client does not start DHCP Authentication
   transaction, NAS MAY decide to respond to HGW without using DHCP
   Authentication, falling back to traditional DHCP message flow and
   assigning different network resources.

   Scenario 3: HGW supports the DHCP Authentication and NAS does not
   support DHCP Authentication.

   In this case the DHCP client inserts in the DHCPDISCOVER message sent
   to NAS, the DHCP Authentication Protocol Option described in the
   draft in order to communicate the NAS that it is able to perform
   authentication and for indicating the authentication algorithm
   preferred by the client.  NAS on receiving a DHCPDISCOVER with
   unknown option silently discards unknown message.  Alternatively NAS
   MAY ignore the unknown option, but still process the message and then
   reply to the DHCP client with traditional response.  The HGW, that
   has upgraded software, realizes that the NAS does not support DHCP
   Authentication and can reverts back to normal DHCP message flow.

Internet-Draft             DHCP Authentication                March 2009


   Scenario 4 Both HGW and NAS support DHCP Authentication

   In this case DHCP client inserts in the DHCPDISCOVER message sent to
   NAS, the DHCP Authentication Protocol Option in order to communicate
   the NAS that it is able to perform authentication and for indicating
   the authentication algorithm preferred by the client, NAS replies
   according to the message flow described in this draft.

   The following table summarizes the behavior in the 4 described
   scenarios:
   Relay        Client       Support
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   No           No           No authentication
   Yes          No           No authentication
   No           Yes          No authentication
   Yes          Yes          Authentication as per this document


11.  Security Considerations

11.1.  Message Authentication

   RFC 3118 provides a mechanism to cryptographically protect DHCP
   messages using a key, K, shared between a DHCP client and Server,
   however no mechanism is defined to manage these keys.  Authentication
   exchanges based on EAP have been built into authentication portions
   of network access protocols such as PPP, 802.1X, PANA, IKEv2, and now
   DHCP.  EAP methods may provide for the derivation of shared key
   material, the MSK and the EMSK, on the EAP peer and EAP server.  This
   dynamic key generation enables [RFC3118] protection and allows modes
   of operation where messages are protected from DHCP client to DHCP
   relay which previously would be difficult to manage.

   A future document will look at how to derive the key, K, from the
   EMSK resulting from an EAP exchange and at how this mechanism
   interacts with the DHCP authentication or any EAP authentication
   prior to DHCP.


12.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requires three values to be assigned by IANA if
   non-Vendor message and option space is not use.  Currently the draft
   needs no IANA specified number but this information is captured here
   incase that needs to change in the future.

   The three numbers that could be assigned by IANA are:

   type.
