Abstract

   This document specifies the Key-Request and Key-Response attributes
   in Remote Authentication and Dial-In User Service (RADIUS).  These
   attributes can be used by a visited network entity to request a key
   from the home network and the home domain to deliver the key to the
   visited network entity; the request and response may be piggy-backed
   on the EAP authentication or EAP Re-authentication bootstrapping
   exchange between the user and the user's home RADIUS server or may be

Internet-Draft       RADIUS Key Request and Response           June 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies two new RADIUS [1] attributes for the purpose
   of a user's visited domain entity to request a cryptographic key from
   the home RADIUS server, and for the home RADIUS server to deliver the
   key to the visited domain entity that sent the request.  The request
   and response may be piggy-backed on EAP authentication [5] or EAP Re-
   authentication bootstrapping exchanges [6] between the user and the
   user's home RADIUS server or may be part of a separate exchange.

   The Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) hierarchy specified in [2]
   contains Domain-Specific Root Keys (DSRK) specific to an
   administrative domain.  It is plausible for a visited domain entity
   to request the home domain for a DSRK from the user's home RADIUS
   server during EAP authentication or EAP Re-authentication
   bootstrapping protocol exchange.  There is also proposed work on
   specifying a generic DSRK request protocol.  When RADIUS is used as
   the AAA protocol, the Key-Request attribute specified in this
   document is used for requesting a key and the Key-Response attribute
   is used to deliver the key.

   The key-request attribute contains the requesting entity's identity
   and the type of the key being requested.

   The key-response attribute contains the requesting entity's identity,
   the type of the key, the key itself, its length, name and lifetime.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].


3.  RADIUS Key-Request Attribute

   Description

      The RADIUS Key-Request attribute provides a means for a visited
      domain server to request a key from the home domain of the user.
      This attribute MAY be used in Access-Request messages by a visited
      domain server and MUST NOT be used in Access-Challenge, Access-
      Accept or Access-Reject messages.

      Other than the 1-octet Type and Length fields, this attribute has
      a 1-octet field to indicate the type of the key being requested
      and a variable length field to carry the Requesting Entity's
      Identity.

      The Requesting Entity's Identity is to be copied in the
      corresponding Key-Response attribute.

   Requesting Entity's Identity  The Requesting Entity's Identity is a
      string, and typically takes the form of a fully qualified domain
      name (FQDN).


4.  RADIUS Key-Response Attribute

   Description

Internet-Draft       RADIUS Key Request and Response           June 2007


      The RADIUS Key-Response attribute MAY be included in the Access-
      Accept message by the user's home RADIUS server to send the
      requested key type, key, its name, length, and lifetime.  In
      addition, the requesting entity's identity MAY be included.  This
      attribute MUST NOT be used in Access-Request, Access-Challenge or
      Access-Reject messages.

      Other than the 1-octet Type and Length fields, this attribute has
      a 1-octet field to indicate the type of the key being included, a
      1-octet key length field, a 4-octet key lifetime field, an 8-octet
      key name field, a variable length field to carry the key and
      optionally a variable length field to carry the Requesting
      Entity's Identity.

      The Requesting Entity's Identity is to be copied from the
      corresponding Key-Request attribute.

      This 1-octet field indicates the type of the key being requested.
      This value is copied from the corresponding Key-Request attribute.

   Key Length

      This 1-octet field indicates the length of the key in octets.
      Since the length of the entire message is also included with a
      1-octet field, key length cannot be larger than 240 octets.  If
      the optional attribute "Requesting Entity's Identity" is included
      in the message, the key length is smaller.  Key length MUST be at
      least 64 octets.

   Key Lifetime

      The key lifetime in seconds is indicated within a 4-octet field.

   Key Name

      The key name field in 8 octets in size.

   Key

      The key of type Key Type is included in this field.  This is a
      variable length field.

      A stricter version of RFC 3756 requirements apply for RADIUS
      messages carrying Key-Response Attribute(s).  Implementations of
      this specification MUST support IPsec along with IKEv2 for key
      management.  IPsec ESP with a non-null transform MUST be
      supported, and IPsec ESP with a non-null encryption transform and
      authentication support is necessary to provide per-packet
      confidentiality, authentication, integrity and replay protection.

   Requesting Entity's Identity  The Requesting Entity's Identity is a
      string, and typically takes the form of a fully qualified domain
      name (FQDN).  This field is optional.  Given that the Key Length
      must be at least 64 octets, this field can at most be 192 octets
      in length.


5.  Security Considerations

   A stricter version of RFC 3756 requirements apply for RADIUS messages
   carrying Key-Response Attribute(s).  Implementations of this
   specification MUST support IPsec along with IKEv2 for key management.
   IPsec ESP with a non-null transform MUST be supported, and IPsec ESP
   with a non-null encryption transform and authentication support is
   necessary to provide per-packet confidentiality, authentication,

   integrity and replay protection.

   EAP Channel bindings may be necessary to ensure that the RADIUS user
   and the server are in synchronization regarding the key Requesting
   Entity's Identity.  Specifically, the Requesting Entity advertises
   its identity through the EAP lower layer and the user or the EAP peer
   communicates that identity to the EAP server (and the EAP server
   communicates that identity to the RADIUS server) via the EAP method
   for user/peer to server verification of the Requesting Entity's
   Identity.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies the following IANA registrations in the
   RADIUS Attribute Types Registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types

      Key-Request

      Key-Response

   Within the attributes Key-Request and Key-Response, a Key Type field
   is being specified with the following assignments and rules:

      0 .......  Reserved

      1 .......  Domain-Specific Root Key (DSRK)

      2-191 .....  IANA-managed (Expert Review)

      192-223 .......  Experimental Use

      224-255 ......  Private Use
