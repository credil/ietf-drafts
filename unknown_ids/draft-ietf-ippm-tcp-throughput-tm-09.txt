Abstract

   This framework describes a methodology for measuring end-to-end TCP 
   throughput performance in a managed IP network. The intention is to
   provide a practical methodology to validate TCP layer performance.  
   The goal is to provide a better indication of the user experience. 
   In this framework, various TCP and IP parameters are identified and 
   should be tested as part of a managed IP network.

Internet-Draft      Framework for TCP Throughput Testing   December 2010

1. Introduction

   Network providers are coming to the realization that Layer 2/3
   testing is not enough to adequately ensure end-user's satisfaction. 
   An SLA (Service Level Agreement) is provided to business customers 
   and is generally based upon Layer 2/3 criteria such as access rate, 
   latency, packet loss and delay variations.  On the other hand, 
   measuring TCP throughput provides meaningful results with respect to 
   user experience.  Thus, the network provider community desires to 
   measure IP network throughput performance at the TCP layer.  

   Additionally, business enterprise customers seek to conduct 
   repeatable TCP throughput tests between locations.  Since these 
   enterprises rely on the networks of the providers, a common test 
   methodology with predefined metrics will benefit both parties. 

   Note that the primary focus of this methodology is managed business 
   class IP networks; i.e. those Ethernet terminated services for which 
   businesses are provided an SLA from the network provider.  End-users
   with "best effort" access between locations can use this methodology,
   but this framework and its metrics are intended to be used in a 
   predictable managed IP service environment.

   So the intent behind this document is to define a methodology for 
   testing sustained TCP layer performance.  In this document, the 
   maximum achievable TCP Throughput is that amount of data per unit 
   time that TCP transports when trying to reach Equilibrium, i.e. 
   after the initial slow start and congestion avoidance phases.

   TCP uses a congestion window, (TCP CWND), to determine how many 
   packets it can send at one time. The network path bandwidth delay 
   product (BDP) determines the ideal TCP CWND. With the help of slow 
   start and congestion avoidance mechanisms, TCP probes the network 
   path. So up to the bandwidth limit, a larger TCP CWND permits a 
   higher throughput.  And up to local host limits, TCP "Slow Start" and
   "Congestion Avoidance" algorithms together will determine the TCP 
   CWND size.  The Maximum TCP CWND size is also tributary to the buffer
   space allocated by the kernel for each socket. For each socket, there
   is a default buffer size that can be changed by the program using a 
   system library called just before opening the socket.  There is also
   a kernel enforced maximum buffer size.  This buffer size can be 
   adjusted at both ends of the socket (send and receive).  In order 
   to obtain the maximum throughput, it is critical to use optimal TCP 
   Send and Receive Socket Buffer sizes.

   There are many variables to consider when conducting a TCP throughput
   test, but this methodology focuses on: 
   - RTT and Bottleneck BW 
   - Ideal TCP Receive Window (Ideal Receive Socket Buffer)
   - Ideal Send Socket Buffer
   - TCP Congestion Window (TCP CWND)
   - Path MTU and Maximum Segment Size (MSS)
   - Single Connection and Multiple Connections testing

Internet-Draft      Framework for TCP Throughput Testing   December 2010

   This methodology proposes TCP testing that should be performed in 
   addition to traditional Layer 2/3 type tests.  Layer 2/3 tests are 
   required to verify the integrity of the network before conducting TCP
   tests.  Examples include iperf (UDP mode) or manual packet layer test 
   techniques where packet throughput, loss, and delay measurements are
   conducted.  When available, standardized testing similar to RFC 2544
   [RFC2544] but adapted for use in operational networks may be used. 
   Note: RFC 2544 was never meant to be used outside a lab environment.
   
   The following 2 sections provide a general overview of the test 
   methodology.  

1.1 Terminology

   Common terminologies used in the test methodology are:

   - TCP Throughput Test Device (TCP TTD), refers to compliant TCP 
     host that generates traffic and measures metrics as defined in 
     this methodology. i.e. a dedicated communications test instrument.
   - Customer Provided Equipment (CPE), refers to customer owned 
     equipment (routers, switches, computers, etc.)
   - Customer Edge (CE), refers to provider owned demarcation device.
   - Provider Edge (PE), refers to provider's distribution equipment.
   - Bottleneck Bandwidth (BB), lowest bandwidth along the complete 
     path. Bottleneck Bandwidth and Bandwidth are used synonymously 
     in this document. Most of the time the Bottleneck Bandwidth is 
     in the access portion of the wide area network (CE - PE)
   - Provider (P), refers to provider core network equipment.
   - Network Under Test (NUT), refers to the tested IP network path.
   - Round-Trip Time (RTT), refers to Layer 4 back and forth delay.

    R >-----------------------------------------------------------|
    T                                                             |
    T <-----------------------------------------------------------|

   Note that the NUT may consist of a variety of devices including but 
   not limited to, load balancers, proxy servers or WAN acceleration 
   devices.  The detailed topology of the NUT should be well understood
   when conducting the TCP throughput tests, although this methodology 
   makes no attempt to characterize specific network architectures.
   
   1.2 Test Set-up
   
   This methodology is intended for operational and managed IP networks. 
   A multitude of network architectures and topologies can be tested. 
   The above set-up diagram is very general and it only illustrates the 
   segmentation within end-user and network provider domains.

2. Scope and Goals of this Methodology

   Before defining the goals, it is important to clearly define the 
   areas that are out-of-scope.

   - This methodology is not intended to predict the TCP throughput 
   during the transient stages of a TCP connection, such as the initial 
   slow start.
   
   - This methodology is not intended to definitively benchmark TCP 
   implementations of one OS to another, although some users may find
   some value in conducting qualitative experiments.
   
   - This methodology is not intended to provide detailed diagnosis 
   of problems within end-points or within the network itself as 
   related to non-optimal TCP performance, although a results 
   interpretation section for each test step may provide insight in 
   regards with potential issues.
   
   - This methodology does not propose to operate permanently with high 
   measurement loads.  TCP performance and optimization within 
   operational networks may be captured and evaluated by using data 
   from the "TCP Extended Statistics MIB" [RFC4898]. 

   - This methodology is not intended to measure TCP throughput as part 
   of an SLA, or to compare the TCP performance between service 
   providers or to compare between implementations of this methodology 
   in dedicated communications test instruments.

   In contrast to the above exclusions, a primary goal is to define a 
   method to conduct a practical, end-to-end assessment of sustained 
   TCP performance within a managed business class IP network.  Another 
   key goal is to establish a set of "best practices" that a non-TCP
   expert should apply when validating the ability of a managed network
   to carry end-user TCP applications.	   
   
   Other specific goals are to :

   - Provide a practical test approach that specifies IP hosts 
   configurable TCP parameters such as TCP Receive Window size, Socket 
   Buffer size, MSS (Maximum Segment Size), number of connections, and 
   how these affect the outcome of TCP performance over a network. 
   See section 3.3.3. 

   - Provide specific test conditions like link speed, RTT, TCP Receive 
   Window size, Socket Buffer size and maximum achievable TCP throughput 
   when trying to reach TCP Equilibrium.  For guideline purposes, 
   provide examples of test conditions and their maximum achievable 
   TCP throughput.  Section 2.1 provides specific details concerning the 
   definition of TCP Equilibrium within this methodology while section 3 
   provides specific test conditions with examples.
   
   Note that some TCP/IP stack implementations are using Receive Window 
   Auto-Tuning and cannot be adjusted until this feature is disabled.

   - Define three (3) basic metrics to compare the performance of TCP 
   connections under various network conditions.  See section 3.3.2.
   
   - In test situations where the recommended procedure does not yield
   the maximum achievable TCP throughput results, this methodology 
   provides some possible areas within the end host or the network that 
   should be considered for investigation.   Although again, this 
   methodology is not intended to provide a detailed diagnosis on these
   issues.  See section 3.3.5.

2.1 TCP Equilibrium

   TCP connections have three (3) fundamental congestion window phases :
   
   1 - The Slow Start phase, which occurs at the beginning of a TCP 
   transmission or after a retransmission time out.

   2 - The Congestion Avoidance phase, during which TCP ramps up to 
   establish the maximum attainable throughput on an end-to-end network 
   path.  Retransmissions are a natural by-product of the TCP congestion 
   avoidance algorithm as it seeks to achieve maximum throughput.

   3 - The Loss Recovery phase, which could include Fast Retransmit 
   (Tahoe) or Fast Recovery (Reno & New Reno).  When packet loss occurs, 
   Congestion Avoidance phase transitions either to Fast Retransmission 
   or Fast Recovery depending upon TCP implementations.  If a Time-Out 
   occurs, TCP transitions back to the Slow Start phase.
   
   The following diagram depicts these 3 phases.
   
        /\  |          Trying to reach TCP Equilibrium > > > > > > > > >

   Note : ssthresh = Slow Start threshold.
   
   A well tuned and managed IP network with appropriate TCP adjustments
   in it's IP hosts and applications should perform very close to TCP 
   Equilibrium and to the BB (Bottleneck Bandwidth).

Internet-Draft      Framework for TCP Throughput Testing   December 2010

   This TCP methodology provides guidelines to measure the maximum 
   achievable TCP throughput or maximum TCP sustained rate obtained 
   after TCP CWND has stabilized to an optimal value.  All maximum 
   achievable TCP throughputs specified in section 3 are with respect to 
   this condition.

   It is important to clarify the interaction between the sender's Send 
   Socket Buffer and the receiver's advertised TCP Receive Window.  TCP 
   test programs such as iperf, ttcp, etc. allow the sender to control 
   the quantity of TCP Bytes transmitted and unacknowledged (in-flight), 
   commonly referred to as the Send Socket Buffer.   This is done 
   independently of the TCP Receive Window size advertised by the 
   receiver.  Implications to the capabilities of the Throughput Test 
   Device (TTD) are covered at the end of section 3.

3. TCP Throughput Testing Methodology

   As stated earlier in section 1, it is considered best practice to 
   verify the integrity of the network by conducting Layer2/3 tests such 
   as [RFC2544] or other methods of network stress tests.  Although, it 
   is important to mention here that RFC 2544 was never meant to be used 
   outside a lab environment.  
   
   If the network is not performing properly in terms of packet loss, 
   jitter, etc. then the TCP layer testing will not be meaningful.  A
   dysfunctional network will not acheive optimal TCP throughputs in
   regards with the available bandwidth.

   TCP Throughput testing may require cooperation between the end-user 
   customer and the network provider.  In a Layer 2/3 VPN architecture,
   the testing should be conducted either on the CPE or on the CE device 
   and not on the PE (Provider Edge) router.  

   The following represents the sequential order of steps for this 
   testing methodology:

   1. Identify the Path MTU.  Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery 
   or PLPMTUD, [RFC4821], MUST be conducted to verify the network path 
   MTU.  Conducting PLPMTUD establishes the upper limit for the MSS to 
   be used in subsequent steps.

   2. Baseline Round Trip Time and Bandwidth. This step establishes the 
   inherent, non-congested Round Trip Time (RTT) and the bottleneck 
   bandwidth of the end-to-end network path.  These measurements are 
   used to provide estimates of the ideal TCP Receive Window and Send 
   Socket Buffer sizes that SHOULD be used in subsequent test steps.  
   These measurements reference [RFC2681] and [RFC4898] to measure RTD 
   and the associated RTT.

   3. TCP Connection Throughput Tests.  With baseline measurements
   of Round Trip Time and bottleneck bandwidth, single and multiple TCP
   connection throughput tests SHOULD be conducted to baseline network 
   performance expectations.

Internet-Draft      Framework for TCP Throughput Testing   December 2010

   4. Traffic Management Tests.  Various traffic management and queuing
   techniques can be tested in this step, using multiple TCP 
   connections.  Multiple connections testing should verify that the 
   network is configured properly for traffic shaping versus policing, 
   various queuing implementations and Random Early Discards (RED).

   Important to note are some of the key characteristics and 
   considerations for the TCP test instrument.  The test host may be a
   standard computer or a dedicated communications test instrument. 
   In both cases, they must be capable of emulating both client and 
   server.  

   The following criteria should be considered when selecting whether 
   the TCP test host can be a standard computer or has to be a dedicated 
   communications test instrument: 

   - TCP implementation used by the test host, OS version, i.e. Linux OS 
   kernel using TCP New Reno, TCP options supported, etc.  These will 
   obviously be more important when using dedicated communications test 
   instruments where the TCP implementation may be customized or tuned 
   to run in higher performance hardware.  When a compliant TCP TTD is 
   used, the TCP implementation MUST be identified in the test results. 
   The compliant TCP TTD should be usable for complete end-to-end 
   testing through network security elements and should also be usable 
   for testing network sections.

   - More important, the TCP test host MUST be capable to generate 
   and receive stateful TCP test traffic at the full link speed of the
   network under test. Stateful TCP test traffic means that the test 
   host MUST fully implement a TCP/IP stack; this is generally a comment 
   aimed at dedicated communications test equipments which sometimes 
   "blast" packets with TCP headers. As a general rule of thumb, testing 
   TCP throughput at rates greater than 100 Mbit/sec MAY require high 
   performance server hardware or dedicated hardware based test tools.  

   - A compliant TCP Throughput Test Device MUST allow adjusting both 
   Send and Receive Socket Buffer sizes.  The Receive Socket Buffer MUST 
   be large enough to accommodate the TCP Receive Window Size. Note that 
   some TCP/IP stack implementations are using Receive Window 
   Auto-Tuning and cannot be adjusted until this feature is disabled.

   - Measuring RTT and retransmissions per connection will generally 
   require a dedicated communications test instrument. In the absence of 
   dedicated hardware based test tools, these measurements may need to 
   be conducted with packet capture tools, i.e. conduct TCP throughput 
   tests and analyze RTT and retransmission results in packet captures.  
   Another option may be to use "TCP Extended Statistics MIB" per 
   [RFC4898].

   - The RFC4821 PLPMTUD test SHOULD be conducted with a dedicated 
   tester which exposes the ability to run the PLPMTUD algorithm 
   independent from the OS stack.

3.1. Determine Network Path MTU

   TCP implementations should use Path MTU Discovery techniques (PMTUD).
   PMTUD relies on ICMP 'need to frag' messages to learn the path MTU.
   When a device has a packet to send which has the Don't Fragment (DF)
   bit in the IP header set and the packet is larger than the Maximum
   Transmission Unit (MTU) of the next hop, the packet is dropped and 
   the device sends an ICMP 'need to frag' message back to the host that 
   originated the packet. The ICMP 'need to frag' message includes
   the next hop MTU which PMTUD uses to tune the TCP Maximum Segment
   Size (MSS). Unfortunately, because many network managers completely 
   disable ICMP, this technique does not always prove reliable.

   Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery or PLPMTUD [RFC4821] MUST then
   be conducted to verify the network path MTU.  PLPMTUD can be used 
   with or without ICMP. The following sections provide a summary of the 
   PLPMTUD approach and an example using TCP. [RFC4821] specifies a 
   search_high and a search_low parameter for the MTU.  As specified in 
   [RFC4821], 1024 Bytes is a safe value for search_low in modern 
   networks.
   
   It is important to determine the links overhead along the IP path,
   and then to select a TCP MSS size corresponding to the Layer 3 MTU.
   For example, if the MTU is 1024 Bytes and the TCP/IP headers are 40
   Bytes, then the MSS would be set to 984 Bytes.

   An example scenario is a network where the actual path MTU is 1240 
   Bytes.  The TCP client probe MUST be capable of setting the MSS for
   the probe packets and could start at MSS = 984 (which corresponds
   to an MTU size of 1024 Bytes).  

   The TCP client probe would open a TCP connection and advertise the 
   MSS as 984.  Note that the client probe MUST generate these packets 
   with the DF bit set. The TCP client probe then sends test traffic 
   per a small default Send Socket Buffer size of ~8KBytes.  It should 
   be kept small to minimize the possibility of congesting the network, 
   which may induce packet loss.  The duration of the test should also 
   be short (10-30 seconds), again to minimize congestive effects
   during the test.   

   In the example of a 1240 Bytes path MTU, probing with an MSS equal to
   984 would yield a successful probe and the test client packets would
   be successfully transferred to the test server.

Internet-Draft      Framework for TCP Throughput Testing   December 2010   

   Also note that the test client MUST verify that the MSS advertised
   is indeed negotiated.  Network devices with built-in Layer 4 
   capabilities can intercede during the connection establishment and 
   reduce the advertised MSS to avoid fragmentation.  This is certainly 
   a desirable feature from a network perspective, but it can yield 
   erroneous test results if the client test probe does not confirm the 
   negotiated MSS.

   The next test probe would use the search_high value and this would
   be set to MSS = 1460 to correspond to a 1500 Bytes MTU.  In this 
   example, the test client will retransmit based upon time-outs, since
   no ACKs will be received from the test server.  This test probe is 
   marked as a conclusive failure if none of the test packets are 
   ACK'ed.  If any of the test packets are ACK'ed, congestive network 
   may be the cause and the test probe is not conclusive.  Re-testing 
   at other times of the day is recommended to further isolate.

   The test is repeated until the desired granularity of the MTU is 
   discovered.  The method can yield precise results at the expense of
   probing time.  One approach may be to reduce the probe size to 
   half between the unsuccessful search_high and successful search_low 
   value and raise it by half also when seeking the upper limit.

3.2. Baseline Round Trip Time and Bandwidth

   Before stateful TCP testing can begin, it is important to determine 
   the baseline Round Trip Time (non-congested inherent delay) and 
   bottleneck bandwidth of the end-to-end network to be tested.  These 
   measurements are used to provide estimates of the ideal TCP Receive
   Window and Send Socket Buffer sizes that SHOULD be used in subsequent 
   test steps. 

3.2.1 Techniques to Measure Round Trip Time

   Following the definitions used in section 1.1, Round Trip Time (RTT) 
   is the elapsed time between the clocking in of the first bit of a 
   payload sent packet to the receipt of the last bit of the 
   corresponding Acknowledgment.  Round Trip Delay (RTD) is used 
   synonymously to twice the Link Latency.  RTT measurements SHOULD use 
   techniques defined in [RFC2681] or statistics available from MIBs 
   defined in [RFC4898].

   The RTT SHOULD be baselined during "off-peak" hours to obtain a 
   reliable figure for inherent network latency versus additional delay
   caused by network buffering.  When sampling values of RTT over a test 
   interval, the minimum value measured SHOULD be used as the baseline 
   RTT since this will most closely estimate the inherent network 
   latency.  This inherent RTT is also used to determine the Buffer
   Delay Percentage metric which is defined in Section 3.3.2

Internet-Draft      Framework for TCP Throughput Testing   December 2010 


   The following list is not meant to be exhaustive,  although it 
   summarizes some of the most common ways to determine round trip time. 
   The desired resolution of the measurement (i.e. msec versus usec) may 
   dictate whether the RTT measurement can be achieved with ICMP pings 
   or by a dedicated communications test instrument with precision 
   timers.  
   
   The objective in this section is to list several techniques 
   in order of decreasing accuracy.

   - Use test equipment on each end of the network, "looping" the 
   far-end tester so that a packet stream can be measured back and forth
   from end-to-end. This RTT measurement may be compatible with delay 
   measurement protocols specified in [RFC5357].

   - Conduct packet captures of TCP test sessions using "iperf" or FTP, 
   or other TCP test applications.   By running multiple experiments, 
   packet captures can then be analyzed to estimate RTT.  It is 
   important to note that results based upon the SYN -> SYN-ACK at the 
   beginning of TCP sessions should be avoided since Firewalls might 
   slow down 3 way handshakes.

   - ICMP pings may also be adequate to provide round trip time 
   estimates, provided that the packet size is factored into the 
   estimates (i.e. pings with different packet sizes might be required).
   Some limitations with ICMP Ping may include msec resolution and 
   whether the network elements are responding to pings or not.  Also, 
   ICMP is often rate-limited and segregated into different buffer 
   queues and is not as reliable and accurate as in-band measurements.

3.2.2 Techniques to Measure end-to-end Bandwidth

   There are many well established techniques available to provide 
   estimated measures of bandwidth over a network.  These measurements 
   SHOULD be conducted in both directions of the network, especially for
   access networks, which may be asymmetrical.  Measurements SHOULD use 
   network capacity techniques defined in [RFC5136].

   Before any TCP Throughput test can be done, a bandwidth measurement 
   test MUST be run with stateless IP streams(not stateful TCP) in order 
   to determine the available bandwidths in each direction.  This test 
   should obviously be performed at various intervals throughout a 
   business day or even across a week.  Ideally, the bandwidth test 
   should produce logged outputs of the achieved bandwidths across the 
   test interval.

3.3. TCP Throughput Tests

   This methodology specifically defines TCP throughput techniques to 
   verify sustained TCP performance in a managed business IP network, as
   defined in section 2.1. This section and others will define the 
   method to conduct these sustained TCP throughput tests and guidelines
   for the predicted results.

   With baseline measurements of round trip time and bandwidth 
   from section 3.2, a series of single and multiple TCP connection
   throughput tests SHOULD be conducted to baseline network performance
   against expectations.  The number of trials and the type of testing 
   (single versus multiple connections) will vary according to the 
   intention of the test.  One example would be a single connection test
   in which the throughput achieved by large Send Socket Buffer and TCP 
   Receive Window sizes (i.e. 256KB) is to be measured. It would be 
   advisable to test performance at various times of the business day.

   It is RECOMMENDED to run the tests in each direction independently 
   first, then run both directions simultaneously.  In each case,
   TCP Transfer Time, TCP Efficiency, and Buffer Delay Percentage MUST 
   be measured in each direction.  These metrics are defined in 3.3.2.


3.3.1 Calculate Ideal TCP Receive Window Size

   The ideal TCP Receive Window size can be calculated from the 
   bandwidth delay product (BDP), which is:

   BDP (bits) = RTT (sec) x Bandwidth (bps)

   Note that the RTT is being used as the "Delay" variable in the 
   BDP calculations. 

   Then, by dividing the BDP by 8, we obtain the "ideal" TCP Receive 
   Window size in Bytes.  For optimal results, the Send Socket Buffer 
   size must be adjusted to the same value at the opposite end of the 
   network path.
   
   Ideal TCP RWIN = BDP / 8 
   
   An example would be a T3 link with 25 msec RTT.  The BDP would equal
   ~1,105,000 bits and the ideal TCP Receive Window would be ~138 
   KBytes.
   
   Note that separate calculations are required on asymetrical paths.  
   An asymetrical path example would be a 90 msec RTT ADSL line with 
   5Mbps downstream and 640Kbps upstream. The downstream BDP would equal 
   ~450,000 bits while the upstream one would be only ~57,600 bits.

   The following table provides some representative network Link Speeds,
   RTT, BDP, and their associated Ideal TCP Receive Window sizes.

   * Note that link speed is the bottleneck bandwidth for the NUT

   The following serial link speeds are used:
   - T1 = 1.536 Mbits/sec (for a B8ZS line encoding facility)
   - T3 = 44.21 Mbits/sec (for a C-Bit Framing facility)

   The above table illustrates the ideal TCP Receive Window size. 
   If a smaller TCP Receive Window is used, then the TCP Throughput
   is not optimal. To calculate the TCP Throughput, the following 
   formula is used: TCP Throughput = TCP RWIN X 8 / RTT
   
   An example could be a 100 Mbps IP path with 5 ms RTT and a TCP
   Receive Window size of 16KB, then:

   TCP Throughput = 16 KBytes X 8 bits / 5 ms.
   TCP Throughput = 128,000 bits / 0.005 sec.
   TCP Throughput = 25.6 Mbps.

   Another example for a T3 using the same calculation formula is 
   illustrated on the next page:
   TCP Throughput = TCP RWIN X 8 / RTT.
   TCP Throughput = 16 KBytes X 8 bits / 10 ms.
   TCP Throughput = 128,000 bits / 0.01 sec.
   TCP Throughput = 12.8 Mbps.
   
   When the TCP Receive Window size exceeds the BDP (i.e. T3 link, 
   64 KBytes TCP Receive Window on a 10 ms RTT path), the maximum frames
   per second limit of 3664 is reached and the calculation formula is:
   
   TCP Throughput = Max FPS X MSS X 8.
   TCP Throughput = 3664 FPS X 1460 Bytes X 8 bits.
   TCP Throughput = 42.8 Mbps

Internet-Draft       Framework for TCP Throughput Testing  December 2010

3.3.2 Metrics for TCP Throughput Tests

   This framework focuses on a TCP throughput methodology and also
   provides several basic metrics to compare results of various 
   throughput tests.  It is recognized that the complexity and 
   unpredictability of TCP makes it impossible to develop a complete 
   set of metrics that accounts for the myriad of variables (i.e. RTT 
   variation, loss conditions, TCP implementation, etc.).  However, 
   these basic metrics will facilitate TCP throughput comparisons
   under varying network conditions and between network traffic 
   management techniques.

   The first metric is the TCP Transfer Time, which is simply the 
   measured time it takes to transfer a block of data across 
   simultaneous TCP connections.  This concept is useful when 
   benchmarking traffic management techniques and where multiple 
   TCP connections are required.

   TCP Transfer time may also be used to provide a normalized ratio of
   the actual TCP Transfer Time versus the Ideal Transfer Time.  This 
   ratio is called the TCP Transfer Index and is defined as:

                     Actual TCP Transfer Time
                    -------------------------
                     Ideal TCP Transfer Time



   The Ideal TCP Transfer time is derived from the network path 
   bottleneck bandwidth and various Layer 1/2/3/4 overheads associated
   with the network path.  Additionally, both the TCP Receive Window and
   the Send Socket Buffer sizes must be tuned to equal the bandwidth 
   delay product (BDP) as described in section 3.3.1.

   The following table illustrates the Ideal TCP Transfer time of a 
   single TCP connection when its TCP Receive Window and Send Socket 
   Buffer sizes are equal to the BDP.

   For a 100MB file(100 x 8 = 800 Mbits), the Ideal TCP Transfer Time 
   is derived as follows:

                                           800 Mbits
       Ideal TCP Transfer Time = -----------------------------------
                                  Maximum Achievable TCP Throughput

   The maximum achievable layer 2 throughput on T1 and T3 Interfaces 
   is based on the maximum frames per second (FPS) permitted by the 
   actual layer 1 speed when the MTU is 1500 Bytes.

   The maximum FPS for a T1 is 127 and the calculation formula is:
   FPS = T1 Link Speed / ((MTU + PPP + Flags + CRC16) X 8)
   FPS = (1.536M /((1500 Bytes + 4 Bytes + 2 Bytes + 2 Bytes) X 8 )))
   FPS = (1.536M / (1508 Bytes X 8))  
   FPS = 1.536 Mbps / 12064 bits
   FPS = 127   
   
   The maximum FPS for a T3 is 3664 and the calculation formula is:
   FPS = T3 Link Speed / ((MTU + PPP + Flags + CRC16) X 8)
   FPS = (44.21M /((1500 Bytes + 4 Bytes + 2 Bytes + 2 Bytes) X 8 )))
   FPS = (44.21M / (1508 Bytes X 8))  
   FPS = 44.21 Mbps / 12064 bits
   FPS = 3664
  
   The 1508 equates to: 

     MTU + PPP + Flags + CRC16   

   Where MTU is 1500 Bytes, PPP is 4 Bytes, Flags are 2 Bytes and CRC16 
   is 2 Bytes.
   
   Then, to obtain the Maximum Achievable TCP Throughput (layer 4), we
   simply use: MSS in Bytes X 8 bits X max FPS. 
   For a T3, the maximum TCP Throughput = 1460 Bytes X 8 bits X 3664 FPS
   Maximum TCP Throughput = 11680 bits X 3664 FPS
   Maximum TCP Throughput = 42.8 Mbps.
 
   The maximum achievable layer 2 throughput on Ethernet Interfaces is 
   based on the maximum frames per second permitted by the IEEE802.3 
   standard when the MTU is 1500 Bytes.

   The maximum FPS for 100M Ethernet is 8127 and the calculation is:
   FPS = (100Mbps /(1538 Bytes X 8 bits))
   
   The maximum FPS for GigE is 81274 and the calculation formula is:
   FPS = (1Gbps /(1538 Bytes X 8 bits))
   
   The maximum FPS for 10GigE is 812743 and the calculation formula is: 
   FPS = (10Gbps /(1538 Bytes X 8 bits))

Internet-Draft       Framework for TCP Throughput Testing  December 2010
  
   
   The 1538 equates to:

     MTU + Eth + CRC32 + IFG + Preamble + SFD

   Where MTU is 1500 Bytes, Ethernet is 14 Bytes, CRC32 is 4 Bytes, 
   IFG is 12 Bytes, Preamble is 7 Bytes and SFD is 1 Byte.
	
   Note that better results could be obtained with jumbo frames on
   GigE and 10 GigE. 	

   Then, to obtain the Maximum Achievable TCP Throughput (layer 4), we
   simply use: MSS in Bytes X 8 bits X max FPS. 
   For a 100M, the maximum TCP Throughput = 1460 B X 8 bits X 8127 FPS
   Maximum TCP Throughput = 11680 bits X 8127 FPS
   Maximum TCP Throughput = 94.9 Mbps.
   
   To illustrate the TCP Transfer Time Index, an example would be the 
   bulk transfer of 100 MB over 5 simultaneous TCP connections  (each 
   connection uploading 100 MB).  In this example, the Ethernet service
   provides a Committed Access Rate (CAR) of 500 Mbit/s.  Each 
   connection may achieve different throughputs during a test and the 
   overall throughput rate is not always easy to determine (especially 
   as the number of connections increases).

   The ideal TCP Transfer Time would be ~8 seconds, but in this example, 
   the actual TCP Transfer Time was 12 seconds.  The TCP Transfer Index 
   would then be 12/8 = 1.5, which indicates that the transfer across 
   all connections took 1.5 times longer than the ideal.

   The second metric is TCP Efficiency, which is the percentage of Bytes
   that were not retransmitted and is defined as:

                Transmitted Bytes - Retransmitted Bytes
                ---------------------------------------  x 100
                          Transmitted Bytes

   Transmitted Bytes are the total number of TCP payload Bytes to be 
   transmitted which includes the original and retransmitted Bytes. This 
   metric provides a comparative measure between various QoS mechanisms
   like traffic management or congestion avoidance.  Various TCP 
   implementations like Reno, Vegas, etc. could also be compared.

   As an example, if 100,000 Bytes were sent and 2,000 had to be 
   retransmitted, the TCP Efficiency should be calculated as:

                   102,000 - 2,000
                   ----------------  x 100 = 98.03%
                        102,000

   Note that the retransmitted Bytes may have occurred more than once,
   and these multiple retransmissions are added to the Retransmitted 
   Bytes count (and the Transmitted Bytes count).

   The third metric is the Buffer Delay Percentage, which represents the 
   increase in RTT during a TCP throughput test with respect to 
   inherent or baseline network RTT. The baseline RTT is the round-trip 
   time inherent to the network path under non-congested conditions.
   (See 3.2.1 for details concerning the baseline RTT measurements).

   The Buffer Delay Percentage is defined as:

              Average RTT during Transfer - Baseline RTT
              ------------------------------------------ x 100
                             Baseline RTT    

   As an example, the baseline RTT for the network path is 25 msec.  
   During the course of a TCP transfer, the average RTT across the 
   entire transfer increased to 32 msec.  In this example, the Buffer 
   Delay Percentage would be calculated as:

                          32 - 25
                          ------- x 100 = 28%
                             25

   Note that the TCP Transfer Time, TCP Efficiency, and Buffer Delay 
   Percentage MUST be measured during each throughput test. Poor TCP 
   Transfer Time Indexes (TCP Transfer Time greater than Ideal TCP 
   Transfer Times) may be diagnosed by correlating with sub-optimal TCP
   Efficiency and/or Buffer Delay Percentage metrics.  

3.3.3 Conducting the TCP Throughput Tests

   Several TCP tools are currently used in the network world and one of 
   the most common is "iperf". With this tool, hosts are installed at 
   each end of the network path; one acts as client and the other as 
   a server.  The Send Socket Buffer and the TCP Receive Window sizes 
   of both client and server can be manually set.  The achieved 
   throughput can then be measured, either uni-directionally or 
   bi-directionally.  For higher BDP situations in lossy networks 
   (long fat networks or satellite links, etc.), TCP options such as 
   Selective Acknowledgment SHOULD be considered and become part of 
   the window size / throughput characterization.
   
   Note that some TCP/IP stack implementations are using Receive Window 
   Auto-Tuning and cannot be adjusted until this feature is disabled.
   
   Host hardware performance must be well understood before conducting
   the tests described in the following sections.  A dedicated 
   communications test instrument will generally be required, especially 
   for line rates of GigE and 10 GigE.  A compliant TCP TTD SHOULD 
   provide a warning message when the expected test throughput will 
   exceed 10% of the network bandwidth capacity.  If the throughput test
   is expected to exceed 10% of the provider bandwidth, then the test 
   should be coordinated with the network provider.  This does not 
   include the customer premise bandwidth, the 10% refers directly to 
   the provider's bandwidth (Provider Edge to Provider router).

Internet-Draft       Framework for TCP Throughput Testing  December 2010

   The TCP throughput test should be run over a long enough duration 
   to properly exercise network buffers (greater than 30 seconds) and 
   also characterize performance at different time periods of the day.  


3.3.4 Single vs. Multiple TCP Connection Testing

   The decision whether to conduct single or multiple TCP connection 
   tests depends upon the size of the BDP in relation to the configured
   TCP Receive Window sizes configured in the end-user environment.  
   For example, if the BDP for a long fat network turns out to be 2MB, 
   then it is probably more realistic to test this network path with 
   multiple connections.  Assuming typical host computer TCP Receive 
   Window Sizes of 64 KB, using 32 TCP connections would realistically 
   test this path. 

   The following table is provided to illustrate the relationship
   between the TCP Receive Window size and the number of TCP connections 
   required to utilize the available capacity of a given BDP. For this 
   example, the network bandwidth is 500 Mbps and the RTT is 5 ms, then 
   the BDP equates to 312.5 KBytes.
  
      TCP        Number of TCP Connections
      Window     to fill available bandwidth 
     -------------------------------------
       16KB             20
       32KB             10
       64KB              5
      128KB              3

   Note that some TCP/IP stack implementations are using Receive Window 
   Auto-Tuning and cannot be adjusted until this feature is disabled.

   The TCP Transfer Time metric is useful for conducting multiple
   connection tests.  Each connection should be configured to transfer
   payloads of the same size (i.e. 100 MB), and the TCP Transfer time 
   should provide a simple metric to verify the actual versus expected 
   results.

   Note that the TCP transfer time is the time for all connections to 
   complete the transfer of the configured payload size.  From the 
   previous table, the 64KB window is considered.  Each of the 5 
   TCP connections would be configured to transfer 100MB, and each one
   should obtain a maximum of 100 Mb/sec.  So for this example, the 
   100MB payload should be transferred across the connections in 
   approximately 8 seconds (which would be the ideal TCP transfer time 
   under these conditions).

   Additionally, the TCP Efficiency metric MUST be computed for each
   connection tested as defined in section 3.3.2.

3.3.5 Interpretation of the TCP Throughput Results

   At the end of this step, the user will document the theoretical BDP 
   and a set of Window size experiments with measured TCP throughput for
   each TCP window size.  For cases where the sustained TCP throughput 
   does not equal the ideal value, some possible causes are:

   - Network congestion causing packet loss which MAY be inferred from 
     a poor TCP Efficiency % (higher TCP Efficiency % = less packet 
     loss) 
   - Network congestion causing an increase in RTT which MAY be inferred
     from the Buffer Delay Percentage (i.e., 0% = no increase in RTT 
     over baseline)
   - Intermediate network devices which actively regenerate the TCP
     connection and can alter TCP Receive Window size, MSS, etc.  
   - Rate limiting (policing).  More details on traffic management 
     tests follows in section 3.4 

3.4. Traffic Management Tests 

   In most cases, the network connection between two geographic 
   locations (branch offices, etc.) is lower than the network connection
   to host computers.  An example would be LAN connectivity of GigE
   and WAN connectivity of 100 Mbps.  The WAN connectivity may be 
   physically 100 Mbps or logically 100 Mbps (over a GigE WAN 
   connection). In the later case, rate limiting is used to provide the
   WAN bandwidth per the SLA.

   Traffic management techniques are employed to provide various forms 
   of QoS, the more common include:

   - Traffic Shaping
   - Priority queuing
   - Random Early Discard (RED)

   Configuring the end-to-end network with these various traffic 
   management mechanisms is a complex under-taking. For traffic shaping 
   and RED techniques, the end goal is to provide better performance to 
   bursty traffic such as TCP,(RED is specifically intended for TCP).

   This section of the methodology provides guidelines to test traffic 
   shaping and RED implementations.  As in section 3.3, host hardware
   performance must be well understood before conducting the traffic 
   shaping and RED tests. Dedicated communications test instrument will 
   generally be REQUIRED for line rates of GigE and 10 GigE.  If the 
   throughput test is expected to exceed 10% of the provider bandwidth, 
   then the test should be coordinated with the network provider.  This 
   does not include the customer premises bandwidth, the 10% refers to 
   the provider's bandwidth (Provider Edge to Provider router). Note 
   that GigE and 10 GigE interfaces might benefit from hold-queue 
   adjustments in order to prevent the saw-tooth TCP traffic pattern.

3.4.1 Traffic Shaping Tests 

   For services where the available bandwidth is rate limited, two (2) 
   techniques can be used: traffic policing or traffic shaping. 

   Simply stated, traffic policing marks and/or drops packets which 
   exceed the SLA bandwidth (in most cases, excess traffic is dropped).  
   Traffic shaping employs the use of queues to smooth the bursty
   traffic and then send out within the SLA bandwidth limit (without 
   dropping packets unless the traffic shaping queue is exhausted).

   Traffic shaping is generally configured for TCP data services and 
   can provide improved TCP performance since the retransmissions are 
   reduced, which in turn optimizes TCP throughput for the available 
   bandwidth.  Through this section, the rate-limited bandwidth shall 
   be referred to as the "bottleneck bandwidth".

   The ability to detect proper traffic shaping is more easily diagnosed
   when conducting a multiple TCP connections test.  Proper shaping will
   provide a fair distribution of the available bottleneck bandwidth,
   while traffic policing will not.

   The traffic shaping tests are built upon the concepts of multiple
   connections testing as defined in section 3.3.3.  Calculating the BDP
   for the bottleneck bandwidth is first required before selecting the 
   number of connections, the Send Socket Buffer and TCP Receive Window 
   sizes per connection.  

   Similar to the example in section 3.3, a typical test scenario might
   be:  GigE LAN with a 100Mbps bottleneck bandwidth (rate limited 
   logical interface), and 5 msec RTT.  This would require five (5) TCP
   connections of 64 KB Send Socket Buffer and TCP Receive Window sizes
   to evenly fill the bottleneck bandwidth (~100 Mbps per connection).

   The traffic shaping test should be run over a long enough duration to
   properly exercise network buffers (greater than 30 seconds) and also 
   characterize performance during different time periods of the day.  
   The throughput of each connection MUST be logged during the entire 
   test, along with the TCP Transfer Time, TCP Efficiency, and 
   Buffer Delay Percentage.

3.4.1.1 Interpretation of Traffic Shaping Test Results

   By plotting the throughput achieved by each TCP connection, the fair
   sharing of the bandwidth is generally very obvious when traffic 
   shaping is properly configured for the bottleneck interface.  For the
   previous example of 5 connections sharing 500 Mbps, each connection 
   would consume ~100 Mbps with a smooth variation.  

   If traffic policing was present on the bottleneck interface, the 
   bandwidth sharing may not be fair and the resulting throughput plot
   may reveal "spikey" throughput consumption of the competing TCP
   connections (due to the TCP retransmissions).

Internet-Draft       Framework for TCP Throughput Testing  December 2010

3.4.2 RED Tests


   Random Early Discard techniques are specifically targeted to provide
   congestion avoidance for TCP traffic.  Before the network element 
   queue "fills" and enters the tail drop state, RED drops packets at 
   configurable queue depth thresholds.  This action causes TCP 
   connections to back-off which helps to prevent tail drop, which in
   turn helps to prevent global TCP synchronization.

   Again, rate limited interfaces may benefit greatly from RED based
   techniques.  Without RED, TCP may not be able to achieve the full 
   bottleneck bandwidth.  With RED enabled, TCP congestion avoidance 
   throttles the connections on the higher speed interface (i.e. LAN) 
   and can help achieve the full bottleneck bandwidth.  The burstiness 
   of TCP traffic is a key factor in the overall effectiveness of RED 
   techniques; steady state bulk transfer flows will generally not 
   benefit from RED.  With bulk transfer flows, network device queues 
   gracefully throttle the effective throughput rates due to increased 
   delays.

   The ability to detect proper RED configuration is more easily 
   diagnosed when conducting a multiple TCP connections test.  Multiple 
   TCP connections provide the bursty sources that emulate the 
   real-world conditions for which RED was intended.

   The RED tests also builds upon the concepts of multiple connections 
   testing as defined in section 3.3.3.  Calculating the BDP for the 
   bottleneck bandwidth is first required before selecting the number 
   of connections, the Send Socket Buffer size and the TCP Receive 
   Window size per connection.

   For RED testing, the desired effect is to cause the TCP connections
   to burst beyond the bottleneck bandwidth so that queue drops will
   occur.  Using the same example from section 3.4.1 (traffic shaping),
   the 500 Mbps bottleneck bandwidth requires 5 TCP connections (with
   window size of 64KB) to fill the capacity.  Some experimentation is
   required, but it is recommended to start with double the number of
   connections to stress the network element buffers / queues (10 
   connections for this example). 

   The TCP TTD must be configured to generate these connections as 
   shorter (bursty) flows versus bulk transfer type flows.  These TCP 
   bursts should stress queue sizes in the 512KB range.  Again 
   experimentation will be required; the proper number of TCP 
   connections, the Send Socket Buffer and TCP Receive Window sizes will
   be dictated by the size of the network element queue.

3.4.2.1 Interpretation of RED Results

   The default queuing technique for most network devices is FIFO based.
   Without RED, the FIFO based queue may cause excessive loss to all of
   the TCP connections and in the worst case global TCP synchronization.  

   By plotting the aggregate throughput achieved on the bottleneck 
   interface, proper RED operation may be determined if the bottleneck
   bandwidth is fully utilized.  For the previous example of 10 
   connections (window = 64 KB) sharing 500 Mbps, each connection should
   consume ~50 Mbps.  If RED was not properly enabled on the interface, 
   then the TCP connections will retransmit at a higher rate and the 
   net effect is that the bottleneck bandwidth is not fully utilized.

   Another means to study non-RED versus RED implementation is to use
   the TCP Transfer Time metric for all of the connections.  In this
   example, a 100 MB payload transfer should take ideally 16 seconds 
   across all 10 connections (with RED enabled).  With RED not enabled, 
   the throughput across the bottleneck bandwidth may be greatly 
   reduced (generally 10-20%) and the actual TCP Transfer time may be 
   proportionally longer then the Ideal TCP Transfer time.

   Additionally, non-RED implementations may exhibit a lower TCP 
   Transfer Efficiency.

4. Security Considerations

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live networks are relevant here as well.  See [RFC4656] and
   [RFC5357].

5. IANA Considerations

   This document does not REQUIRE an IANA registration for ports 
   dedicated to the TCP testing described in this document.
