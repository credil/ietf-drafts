   DHCPv4 Options for Home Information Discovery in Dual Stack MIPv6
                     draft-xia-mext-hioptv4-02.txt

Abstract

   This document defines DHCPv4 options for dynamic discovery of home
   network information in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6.  New DHCPv4 options
   are defined which allow a mobile node to request the home agent
   IPv4/v6 address, FQDN, or home network prefix and obtain it via the
   DHCPv4 response.

Internet-Draft         DHCPv4 Options for DSMIPv6             April 2011


1.  Introduction

   Before a mobile node can exchange Mobile IPv6 signaling with a home
   agent, it should either know the IP address of the home agent via
   pre-configuration, or dynamically discover it.  New DHCPv6 options
   are defined in [I-D.ietf-mip6-hiopt] which allow a mobile node to
   request the home agent IPv6 address, FQDN, or home network prefix and
   obtain it via the DHCP response.

   [I-D.ietf-mext-nemo-v4traversal](DSMIPv6) extends mobile IPv6
   specification [RFC3775] to allow the registration of IPv4 addresses,
   and the transport of packets over IPv4 tunnels between mobile nodes
   and home agents.  With home agent discovery in DSMIPv6, there are
   actually four different cases:

   o  Discovering HA's IPv6 address with DHCPv6

   o  Discovering HA's IPv4 address with DHCPv6

   o  Discovering HA's IPv4 address with DHCPv4

   o  Discovering HA's IPv6 address with DHCPv4

   The first two cases are dealt with in [I-D.ietf-mip6-hiopt], while
   the last two cases are specified in this document.  DHCPv4 options
   are defined based on DHCPv4 protocol specified in [RFC2131].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  The
   terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-hiopt]


3.  Home Information Discovery Using DHCPv6

   [I-D.ietf-mip6-hiopt] introduces the following DHCPv6 options and
   their sub-options which are used for dynamic discovery of the home
   agent's IPv4/IPv6 address, IPv6 home network prefix, or FQDN
   information in DSMIPv6.

   Home Network Information Option

      This option allows the exchange of home network information
      between the mobile node (DHCPv6 client) and the DHCPv6 server.  It
      is used to indicate the target home network requested by the
      mobile node to the DHCPv6 server.  It also conveys the home
      network information assigned by the DHCPv6 server to the mobile
      node as a response.

   MIP6 Relay Agent Option

      This option carries the home network information for the mobile
      node from the DHCPv6 relay agent to the DHCPv6 server.  For
      instance, the NAS is collocated with the DHCPv6 relay agent, and
      the NAS gets the home network information from external AAA
      servers.  This option is added to the DHCPv6 message when the NAS/
      DHCP relay agent relays DHCPv6 request message from the mobile
      node to the DHCPv6 server, the option is added to the relayed
      message.  Being populated with this information, the DHCPv6 server
      uses Home Network Information Option to reply the mobile node.

   Common Sub-options

      This sub-option is a container for a home network parameter in the
      Home Network Information option or in the MIP6 Relay Agent option.


   In this document, Home Network Information Option Section 4.1 DSMIPv6
   Relay Agent Option Section 4.2 for DHCPv4 are defined to take the
   place of Home Network Information Option and MIP6 Relay Agent Option
   respectively.  The difference between these options and their
   replacements is only on format, that is, these options are for DHCPv6
   while their replacements are for DHCPv4.  Common Sub-options in
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-hiopt] are reused in this document.


4.   DHCPv4 options for HA Dynamic Discovery

4.1.  Home Network Information Option

   The option allows the exchange of home network information between
   the mobile node (DHCPv4 client) and the DHCPv4 server.  It is used to
   indicate the target home network requested by the mobile node to the
   DHCPv4 server.  It also conveys the home network information assigned
   by the DHCPv4 server to the mobile node as a response.
