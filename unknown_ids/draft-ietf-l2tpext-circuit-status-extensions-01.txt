Abstract

   This document defines additional Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol Version 3
   (L2TPv3) bit values to be used within the "Circuit Status" Attribute
   Value Pair (AVP) to communicate more granular error states for Access
   Circuits and Pseudowires.  It also deprecates the use of the New bit
   in the "Circuit Status" AVP, updating RFC3931.

Internet-Draft    L2TPv3 Extended Circuit Status Values    November 2008


1.  Introduction

   Currently the L2TPv3 Circuit Status AVP [RFC3931] is able to convey
   the UP/DOWN status of an access circuit.  However, a finer
   granularity is often useful to determine the direction of the fault
   as has been added for MPLS-based pseudowires and used in the
   pseudowire control protocol using LDP, see Section 3.5 of [RFC4446]
   and Section 5.4.2 of [RFC4447].

   Additionally, it is useful (in redundancy scenarios) to be able to
   indicate if a pseudowire is in a standby state, where it is fully
   established but is not switching data.  Again, such functionality is
   available for MPLS-based pseudowires using LDP, see
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy-bit].

   This document provides extended circuit status bit values for L2TPv3
   and adds them in a manner such that it is backwards compatible with
   the current Circuit Status AVP.  These new bits are applicable to all
   pseudowires types that use the Circuit Status AVP.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  L2TPv3 Extended Circuit Status Values

   The Circuit Status AVP (ICRQ, ICRP, ICCN, OCRQ, OCRP, OCCN, SLI),
   Attribute Type 71, indicates the initial status of or a status change
   in the circuit to which the session is bound.

   The Attribute Value field for this AVP currently defined in [RFC3931]
   has the following format:

      0                   1
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Reserved          |N|A|
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     Bit  Bit-Value   Name
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     (A)  15  0x0001  Active
     (N)  14  0x0002  New

   As currently defined in [RFC3931], the two bits have the following

   meanings:

   o  The A (Active) bit indicates whether the circuit is up/active/
      ready (1) or down/inactive/not-ready (0).

   o  The N (New) bit indicates whether the circuit status indication is
      for a new circuit (1) or an existing circuit (0).

   This document updates the semantics of the A and N bits as follows:

   The A (Active) bit indicates whether the local pseudowire endpoint
   (both local attachment circuit and local PSN-facing pseudowire) has
   no faults present and is up/active/ready (1) or has faults present
   and is down/inactive/not-ready (0).

   The N (New) bit indicates if the notification is for a new circuit
   (1) or an existing circuit (0), and is provided to emulate (Frame
   Relay) NNI signaling between PEs.  It MAY be used to convey that a
   circuit has been re-provisioned or newly provisioned at the PE, which
   can already be inferred from the L2TP control message type.  It is
   therefore uncertain as to what use the receiving PE can make of this
   bit, although it MAY include logging.  This document deprecates this
   bit as it is of little or no use, hence this bit SHOULD be ignored on
   receipt and is OPTIONAL to send.  For reference, see Section 3.4 of
   [RFC4591] which does not specify any additional usage beyond the
   setting of in the ICRQ, ICRP (and OCRQ, OCRP) and clearing in all
   other control messages.

   This document also extends this bitmap of values to allow for finer
   granularity of local pseudowire (i.e., access circuit or PSN-facing
   endpoint) status reporting.

   The Attribute Value field for the Circuit Status AVP including the
   new values has the following format:

      detecting this fault are outside the scope of this document; as an
      example, detection may be via PW Type-specific means, BFD, or

      The pseudowire has been placed into a standby mode which means
      that although it was signaled and is operational, it is NOT
      switching traffic.  Any received traffic SHOULD be dropped.
      Traffic MUST NOT be transmitted.


3.  Circuit Status Usage and Clarifications

   The following are clarifications regarding the usage of the Circuit
   Status AVP bits:



McGill & Pignataro        Expires May 23, 2009                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    L2TPv3 Extended Circuit Status Values    November 2008


   o  The (R), (T), (I) and (E) bits are collectively referred to as
      "fault status bits".

   o  [RFC3931] defined the (A) bit as pertaining to local access
      circuit state only.  This draft redefines it as meaning that "no
      faults are present on the local pseudowire endpoint."

   o  If multiple faults occur, all the fault status bits corresponding
      to each fault MUST be set (i.e., they MUST be bitwise-OR-d
      together).

   o  The (A) bit MUST NOT be set until all fault status bits are
      cleared.  This behavior allows an endpoint to be backwards
      compatible with a remote endpoint that does not understand these
      new status bits.

   o  If any of the fault status bits are set, then the (A) bit MUST be
      cleared.  That is, the fault status bits (R, T, I, E) are a more
      granular definition of (A), such that OR-ing the bits provides an
      inverted (A).

   o  If (A) is clear and the fault status bits (R, T, I, E) are clear,
      it means that there is no extended circuit status.  That is, the
      circuit is down/inactive/not-ready (from the (A) bit), without a
      more granular (extended) indication.

   o  The (S) bit can be set in conjunction with any other bit,
      including (A).  A pseudowire endpoint in Standby (S bit set) can
      be up/active/ready (A bit set) or experiencing a fault (A bit
      cleared and (R, T, I, E) bit(s) set).

   o  Leaving standby mode is indicated by the clearing of the (S) bit.

   o  The usage of the (N) bit has been deprecated.


4.  Security Considerations

   No additional security considerations exist with extending this
   attribute.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The Circuit Status Bits number space reachable at
   [IANA.l2tp-parameters] is managed by IANA as per [RFC3931].  Five new
   bits (bits 9 through 13) and one updated bit (bit 14) are requested
   to be assigned as follows:
