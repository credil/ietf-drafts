Abstract

   This document defines extends SIP with two header fields and
   associated option tags that can be used in INVITE requests to convey
   the requester's preference for user-interface handling related to
   answering of that request.  The first header, "Answer-Mode",
   expresses a preference as to whether the target node's user interface
   waits for user input before accepting the request or instead accepts
   the request without waiting on user input.  The second header, "Priv-

   Answer-Mode" is similar to the first, except that it requests
   administrative-level access and has consequent additional
   authentication and authorization requirements.  These behaviors have
   applicability to applications such as Push-to-Talk and to diagnostics
   like loop-back.  Usage of each header field in a response to indicate
   how the request was handled is also defined.

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


1.  Background

   The conventional model for session establishment using the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP, [RFC3261]) involves 1) sending a request
   for a session (a SIP INVITE), notification of the user receiving the
   request, 2 ) acceptance of the request and of the session by that
   user, and 3 ) the sending of a response (SIP 200 OK) back to the
   requester before the session is established.  Some usage scenarios
   deviate from this model, specifically with respect to the
   notification and acceptance phase.  While it has always been possible
   for the node receiving the request to skip the notification and
   acceptance phases, there has been no standard mechanism for the party
   sending the request to specifically indicate a desire (or
   requirement) for this sort of treatment.  This document defines a SIP
   extension header field that can be used to request specific treatment
   related to the notification and acceptance phase.

   The first usage scenario is the requirement for diagnostic loopback
   calls.  In this sort of scenario, a testing service sends an INVITE
   to a node being tested.  The tested node accepts and a dialog is
   established.  But rather than establishing a two-way media flow, the
   tested node loops back or "echoes" media received from the testing
   service back toward the testing service.  The testing service can
   then analyze the media flow for quality and timing characteristics.
   SDP usage for this sort of flow is described in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-media-loopback].  In this sort of application, it
   might not be necessary that the human using the node under test
   interact with the node in any way for the test to be satisfactorily
   executed.  In some cases, it might be appropriate to alert the user
   to the ongoing test, and in other cases it might not be.

   The second scenario is that of "Push to Talk" applications being
   specified by the Open Mobile Alliance.  In this sort of environment,
   SIP is used to establish `a dialog supporting asynchronous delivery
   of unidirectional media flow, giving a user experience like that of a
   traditional two-way radio.  It is conventional for the INVITES used
   to be automatically accepted by the called UA (User Agent), and the
   media is commonly played out on a loudspeaker.  The called party's
   UA's microphone is not engaged until the user presses the local
   "talk" button to respond.

   A third scenario is the "PBX attendant".  Traditional office PBX
   systems often include intercom functionality.  A typical use for the
   intercom function is to allow a receptionist to activate a
   loudspeaker on a desk telephone in order to announce a visitor.  Not
   every caller can access the loudspeaker, only the receptionist or
   operator, and it is not expected that these callers will always want
   "intercom" functionality -- they might instead want to make an

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


   ordinary call.

   There are presumably many more use cases for the extensions defined
   in this specification, but this document was developed to
   specifically meet the requirements of these scenarios or others with
   essentially similar properties.

   These sorts of mechanisms are not required to provide the
   functionality of an "answering machine" or "voice mail recorder".
   Such a device knows that it is expected to answer and does not
   require a SIP extension to support its behavior.

   Much of the discussion of this topic in working group meetings and on
   the mailing list dealt with differentiating "answering mode" from
   "alerting mode".  Some early work did not make this distinction.  We
   therefore proceed with the following definitions:

   o  Answering Mode includes behaviors in a SIP UA relating to
      acceptance or rejection of a request that are contingent on
      interaction between the UA and the user of that UA after the UA
      has received the request.  We are principally concerned with the
      user interaction involved in accepting the request and initiating
      an active session.  An example of this might be pressing the "yes"
      button on a mobile phone.

   o  Alerting Mode includes behaviors in a SIP UA relating to informing
      the user of the UA that a request to initiate a session has been
      received.  An example of this might be activating the ring tone of
      a mobile phone.

   This document deals only with "Answering Mode".  Issues relating to
   "Alerting Mode" are outside its scope.

   This document defines two SIP extension header fields, "AnswerMode"
   and "Priv-Answer-Mode".  These two extensions take the same
   parameters and operate in the same general way.

   The distinction between Answer-Mode and Priv-Answer-Mode relates to
   the level of authorization being claimed by the UAC and verified and
   policed by the UAS.  Requests are usually made using Answer-Mode.
   Requests made using Priv-Answer-Mode request "privileged" treatment
   from the UAS.  This mechanism is discussed in greater detail below
   under the heading "Special Considerations for Priv-Answer-Mode".

   Priv-Answer-Mode is not an assertion of privilege.  Instead, it is a
   request for privileged treatment.  This is similar to the UNIX model
   where a user might run a command normally, or use "sudo" to request
   administrative privilege for the command.  Including the "Priv-" part



Willis & Allen            Expires March 8, 2008                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


   is equivalent to prefixing a UNIX command with "sudo".

   This distinction is discussed in greater detail in Section 4.3.2.


2.  Syntax of Header Fields and Option Tags

   The following syntax uses ABNF as defined in [RFC4234].

   The syntax for the header fields defined in        this document is:

      Answer-Mode = "Answer-Mode" HCOLON answer-mode-value *(SEMI
      answer-mode-param)

      Priv-Answer-Mode = "Priv-Answer-Mode" HCOLON answer-mode-value
      *(SEMI answer-mode-param)

      answer-mode-value = "Manual" / "Auto" / token

      answer-mode-param= "require" / generic-param

   The SIP option tag indicating support for this extension is
   "answermode".

      For implementors: SIP header field names and values are always
      compared in a case-insensitive manner.  The pretty capitalization
      is just for readability.

   This syntax includes extension hooks, "token" for answer-modes
   values, and "generic-param" for optional parameters, that could be
   defined in future specifications extending this one.  This
   specification defines only the behavior for the values given
   explicitly above.  In order to provide forward compatibility,
   implementations MUST ignore unknown values.


3.  Usage of the Answer-Mode and Priv-Answer-Mode Header Fields

   This document defines usage of the Answer-Mode and Priv-Answer-Mode
   header fields in initial (dialog-forming) SIP INVITE requests and in
   200 (OK) responses to those requests.  This document specifically
   does not define usage in any other sort of request or response,
   including but not limited to ACK, CANCEL, or any mid-dialog usage.

   This limitation stems from the intended usage of this extension,
   which is to affect the way that users interact with communications
   devices when requesting new communications sessions and when
   responding to such requests.  This sort of interaction occurs only

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


   during the formation of a dialog and its initial usage, and not
   during subsequent operations such as re-INVITE.  However, the
   security aspects of the session initiation must be applied to changes
   in media description introduced by re-INVITES or similar requests.
   See for further discussion of this issue. (Section 7.1)


4.  Usage of the Answer-Mode and Priv-Answer-Mode Header Fields in
    Requests

   The Answer-Mode or Priv-Answer-Mode header field is used by a UAC in
   an INVITE request to invoke specific handling by the responding UAS
   related to "automatic answering" functionality for any dialog
   resulting from that INVITE request.  If no Answer-Mode or Priv-
   Answer-Mode header field is included in the request, answering
   behavior is at the discretion of the UAS, as it would be in the
   absence of this specification.  The desired handling is indicated by
   the value of the Answer-Mode or Priv-Answer-Mode header field, as
   follows:


   Manual:  The UAS is asked to defer accepting the request until the
      user of the UAS has interacted with the user interface (UI) of the
      UAS in such a way as to indicate that the user desires the UAS to
      accept the request.

   Auto:  The UAS is asked to accept the request automatically, without
      waiting for the user of the UAS to interact with the UI of the UAS
      in such a way as to indicate that the user desires the UAS to
      accept the request.

   Each value of the Answer-Mode or Priv-Answer-Mode header field can
   include an optional parameter, "require".  If present, this parameter
   indicates that the UAC would prefer that the UAS reject the request
   if the UAS is unwilling (perhaps due to policy) to answer in the mode
   requested, rather than answering in another mode.  For example, this
   parameter could be used to make sure that a test "loopback" call
   doesn't disturb a user who has configured her phone to manually
   answer even if the caller requests an automatic answer.

   The UAS is responsible for deciding how to honor this preference.  In
   general, the UAS makes an authorization decision based on the
   authenticated identity presented in the request using authentication
   mechanisms such as SIP Digest Authentication [RFC3261], the SIP
   Identity mechanism [RFC4474], or (within the restricted networks for
   which it is suitable) the SIP mechanism for asserted identity within
   trusted networks [RFC3325] and using authorization information or
   policy available to the UAS.  This decision making MUST consider the



Willis & Allen            Expires March 8, 2008                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


   risk model of the media session corresponding to the request, and the
   UAS MUST NOT answer without user input in cases where the privacy or
   security of the user would be compromised as a result.  Making this
   determination is a matter of system or application design, and cannot
   be in general addressed by having a set of functions that are
   configurable on or off.  Specific discussion of media sessions and
   appropriate policy is discussed in Section 7.

4.1.  Procedures at User Agent Clients (UAC)

4.1.1.  All Requests

   A UA supporting the Answer-Mode and Priv-Answer-Mode header fields
   SHOULD indicate its support by including an option tag of
   "answermode" in the Supported header field of all requests it sends.

4.1.2.  REGISTER Transactions

   To indicate that it supports the answer-mode negotiation feature, a
   UA MAY include an extensions parameter with a value that includes
   "answermode".  Example:
   ;extensions="answermode,100rel,gruu"

   in the Contact: header field of its REGISTER requests.  This usage of
   feature tags is described in [RFC3840].

   If a UA is dependent on support for callee capabilities in the
   registrar, it MAY include a Require header field with the value
   "pref" in its REGISTER request.  This will cause the registrar to
   reject the request if the registrar does not support callee
   capabilities and caller preferences.
   Require: pref

4.1.3.  INVITE Transactions

   A UAC supporting this specification MAY include an Answer-Mode or
   Priv-Answer-Mode header field in an INVITE where it wishes to
   influence the answering mode of the responding UAS.

      Note: this is meaningful only in initial or dialog-forming INVITE
      requests.  Answer-Mode and Priv-Answer-Mode header fields
      appearing in other requests are ignored.

   To request that the UAS answer only after having interacted with its
   user and receiving an affirmative instruction from that user, the UAC
   includes an Answer-Mode or Priv-Answer-Mode header field having a
   value of "Manual".  Example:
   Answer-Mode: Manual



Willis & Allen            Expires March 8, 2008                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


   To request that the UAS answer manually, and ask that it reject the
   INVITE request if unable or unwilling to answer manually, the UAC
   includes an Answer-Mode or Priv-Answer-Mode header field having a
   value of "Manual" and a parameter of "require".  Example:
   Answer-Mode: Manual;require

   To request that the UAS answer automatically without waiting for
   input from the user, the UAC includes an Answer-Mode or Priv-Answer-
   Mode header field having a value of "Auto".  Example:
   Answer-Mode: Auto

   To request that the UAS answer automatically, and ask that it reject
   the INVITE request if unable or unwilling to answer automatically,
   the UAC includes an Answer-Mode or Priv-Answer-Mode header field
   having a value of "Auto" and a parameter of "require".  Example:
   Answer-Mode: Auto;require

   To require that the UAS either support this extension or reject the
   request, the UAC includes a Require: header field having the value
   "answermode".  This does not actually force the UAS to automatically
   answer, it just requires that the UAS either understand this
   extension or reject the request.  We do not have a SIP negotiation
   technique to force specific behavior.  Rather, the desired behavior
   is indicated in the SIP extension itself.  Example:
   Require: answermode

   To request that retargeting proxies in the path preferentially select
   targets that have indicated support for this extension in their
   registration, a UAC includes an Accept-Contact header field with an
   extensions parameter having a value of "answermode".  This usage of
   Accept-Contact is described in [RFC3841].  This would normally be
   used in conjunction with the "Require: answermode" header field as
   described above.  Example:
   Require: answermode Accept-Contact:
               *;extensions="answermode";methods="INVITE"

   To request that retargeting proxies in the path do not select targets
   that have indicated non-support for this extension in their
   registration, a UAC includes an Accept-Contact header field with an
   extensions parameter having a value of "answermode" and an option
   field of "require".  This usage of Accept-Contact is described in
   [RFC3841].  This would normally be used in conjunction with the
   "Require: answermode" header field as described above.  Example:
   Require: answermode Accept-Contact:
             *;extensions="answermode"; methods="INVITE";require

   To request that retargeting proxies in the path exclusively select
   targets that have indicated support for this extension in their

   registration, a UAC includes an Accept-Contact header field
   extensions parameter having a value of "answermode"" and options of
   "require" and "explicit".  This usage of Accept-Contact is described
   in [RFC3841].  This would normally be used in conjunction with the
   "Require: answermode" header field as described above.
   Require: answermode Accept-Contact:
             *;extensions="answermode";
             methods="INVITE";require;explicit

4.2.  Procedures at Intermediate Proxies

4.2.1.  General Proxy Behavior

   The general procedure at all intermediate proxies including the UAC's
   serving proxy or proxies and the UAS's serving proxy or proxies is to
   ignore the Answer-Mode header field.  However, the serving proxies
   (proxies responsible for resolving an address-of-record (AOR) into a
   registered contact) MAY exercise control over the requested answer
   mode, either inserting or deleting an Answer-Mode or Priv-Answer-Mode
   header field or altering the value of an existing header field in
   accord with local policy.  This could result in behavior that is
   inconsistent with user expectations (such as having a call that was
   intended to be a diagnostic loopback answered by a human) and
   consequently proxies MUST NOT insert, delete, or alter Answer-Mode or
   Priv-Answer-Mode header fields unless explicitly authorized to do so
   by an external agreement between the proxy operator and the user of
   the UA that the proxy is serving.  These serving proxies MAY also
   reject a request according to local policy, and SHOULD use the
   rejection codes as specified below for the UAS if they do so.

4.2.2.  Issues with Automatic Answering and Forking

   One of the well-known issues with forking is the problem of multiple
   acceptance.  If an INVITE request is forked to several UASes, and
   more than one of those replies with a 200 (OK) response, the
   conventional approach is to continue the dialog with the first
   respondent, and tear down the dialog (using BYE requests) with all
   other respondents.

   While this problem exists without an auto-answer negotiation
   capability, it is apparent that widespread adoption of UAs that
   engage in auto-answer behavior will exacerbate the multiple
   acceptance problem.  Consequently, systems designers need to take
   this aspect into consideration.  In general, auto-answer is NOT
   RECOMMENDED in environments that include parallel forking.

   As an alternative, it might be reasonable to use a variation on
   manual-answer combined with no alerting and early media.  In this

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


   approach, the initial message or talk-burst is transmitted as early
   media to all recipients, where it is displayed or played out.  Any
   response utterance (pushing the transmit key and talking) from the
   user of a UAS following this would serve as an "acceptance",
   resulting in a 200 (OK) response being transmitted by their UAS.
   Consequently, the race-condition for acceptance would be limited to
   the subset of UAs actually responding under user control, rather than
   the full set of UAs to which the request was forked.

   Another alternative would be to use dynamic conferencing instead of
   forking.  In this approach, instead of forking the request, a
   conference would be initiated and all registered UAs invited into
   that conference.  The mixer attached to the conference would then
   mediate traffic flows appropriately.

4.3.  Procedures at User Agent Servers (UAS)

4.3.1.  INVITE Transactions

   For a request having an Answer-Mode value of "Manual" and not having
   an Answer-Mode parameter of "require", the UAS SHOULD defer accepting
   the request until the user of the UAS has confirmed willingness to
   accept the request.  This behavior MAY be altered as needed for
   unattended UASes or other local characteristics or policy.  For
   example, an auto-attendant or PSTN gateway system that always answers
   automatically would go ahead and answer, despite the presence of the
   "Manual" Answer-Mode header field value.

   For a request having an Answer-Mode value of "Manual" and an Answer-
   Mode parameter of "require", the UAS MUST defer accepting the request
   until the user of the UAS has confirmed willingness to accept the
   request.  If the UAS is not capable of answering the request in this
   "Manual" mode or is unwilling to do so, it MUST reject the request
   and SHOULD do so with a "403 (Forbidden)" response and MAY include a
   reason phrase of "manual answer forbidden".

   For a request having an Answer-Mode value of "Auto", the UAS SHOULD,
   if the calling party is authenticated and authorized for automatic
   answering, accept the request without further user input.  The UAS
   MAY, according to local policy or user preferences, treat this
   request as it would treat a request having an Answer-Mode with a
   value of "Manual" or having no Answer-Mode header field.  If the
   calling party is not authenticated and authorized for automatic
   answer, the UAS MAY either handle the request as per "manual", or
   reject the request.  If the UAS rejects the request, it SHOULD do so
   with a "403 (Forbidden)" response, and MAY include a reason phrase of
   "automatic answer forbidden".  There may be an interaction with
   [RFC3261] section 23.2, which in some cases requires user validation

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


   of certificates used for S/MIME.  Since this places the same
   interrupt burden on the user as would manually answering the request,
   a UAS experiencing this requirement for user validation of a request
   that requires automatic answering SHOULD reject the request with a
   "403 (Forbidden)" response and MAY include a reason phrase of
   "Certificate validation requires user input not compatible with
   automatic answer."

   For a request having an Answer-Mode value of "Auto" and an Answer-
   Mode parameter of "require", the UAS SHOULD, if the calling party is
   authenticated and authorized for automatic answering, accept the
   request.  The UAS MUST NOT allow "manual" answer of this request, but
   MAY reject it.  If, for whatever reason, the UAS chooses not to
   accept the request automatically, the UAS MUST reject the request and
   SHOULD do so with a "403 (Forbidden)" response, and MAY include a
   reason phrase of "automatic answer forbidden".

   Similar behavior applies for Priv-Answer-Mode, except that the policy
   for authorization may be different (and generally more stringent).

4.3.2.  Special Considerations for Priv-Answer-Mode

   The Answer-Mode and Priv-Answer-Mode header fields have equivalent
   functions, except that Priv-Answer-Mode requests a higher level of
   privilege in granting the answering mode specified by the request.
   The model for this is that an "administrative level of privilege" is
   requested -- where "Answer-Mode" says "Please answer in the following
   mode, if your user preferences allow it", the Priv-Answer-Mode says
   "I command you to answer in the following mode, even if your user
   preferences would ordinarily disallow it".  The UAS MUST NOT grant
   this override capability to an unauthenticated UAC, and SHOULD apply
   a stricter authorization policy to a request with Priv-Answer-Mode
   header fields than it does to requests with Answer-Mode header
   fields.  The default policy SHOULD be to refuse requests containing
   "Priv-Answer-Mode" header fields.

   The use case envisioned for Priv-Answer-Mode relates to handling
   urgent requests from authorized callers.  For example, assume Larry
   is a limousine driver working with a fleet dispatcher.  Larry likes
   to provide a quiet environment for his car, so his communicator is
   configured for manual answer mode for push-to-talk calls.  Each time
   he gets a push-to-talk call, Larry's communicator chimes softly to
   alert him to the call.  If the circumstances permit it, Larry presses
   the communicator in order to accept the call, the communicator sends
   a 200 (OK) response, and the calling party's talk burst is played out
   through the communicator's loudspeaker.  This treatment is delivered
   to incoming requests that have an Answer-Mode header field having
   values of "Manual" or "Auto" (or no Answer-Mode header field at all)



Willis & Allen            Expires March 8, 2008                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


   no matter who the caller is.

   Larry's fleet dispatch operator is familiar with this policy, and
   needs to inform Larry about a critical matter.  The dispatch operator
   tries several times to call Larry (including Answer-Mode: Auto in the
   requests), but the calls aren't accepted because Larry has fallen
   asleep, and therefore isn't pressing his communicator to accept the
   call.

   The operator then presses his "urgent" button and calls Larry again.
   This time, the INVITE request carries a "Priv-Answer-Mode: Auto"
   header field.  Larry's communicator checks the identity of the caller
   (using a SIP Identity assertion or functionally equivalent
   mechanism), and matches the operator's identity against the list of
   users allowed to do Priv-Answer-Mode.  Since the operator is listed,
   the communicator immediately returns a 200 (OK) response accepting
   the call.  The operator speaks, and the resulting talk-burst is
   summarily played out the loudspeaker on Larry's communicator, waking
   him up.

   The effect of requesting Priv-Answer-Mode is different than the
   effect of simply granting higher privilege to an Answer-Mode request
   based on the requester's identity and corresponding authorization
   level.  This distinction is what allows the fleet operator to make
   polite (Answer-Mode: Auto) requests to Larry under normal conditions,
   and receive different handling (Priv-Answer-Mode: Auto) for a request
   having greater urgency.

   In normal operations, only one of "Answer-Mode" and "Priv-Answer-
   Mode" would be used in an INVITE request.  If both are present, the
   UAS will first test the authorization of the requester for Priv-
   Answer-Mode, and if authorized, process the request as if only Priv-
   Answer-Mode had been included.  If the requester is not authorized
   for Priv-Answer-Mode, then the UAS will process the request as if
   only "Answer-Mode" had been included.


5.  Usage of the Answer-Mode and Priv-Answer-Mode Header Fields in
    Responses

   The Answer-Mode header field or Priv-Answer-Mode can be inserted by a
   UAS into a response in order to indicate how it handled the
   associated request with respect to automatic answering functionality.
   The UAC might use this information to inform the user or otherwise
   adapt the behavior of the user interface.  The handling is indicated
   by the value of the header field, as follows:





Willis & Allen            Expires March 8, 2008                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


   Manual:  The UAS responded after the user of the UAS interacted with
      the user interface (UI) of the UAS in such a way as to indicate
      that the user desires the UAS to accept the request.

   Auto:  The UAS responded automatically, without waiting for the user
      of the UAS to interact with the UI of the UAS in such a way as to
      indicate that the user desires the UAS to accept the request.

   The Answer-Mode and Priv-Answer-Mode header fields, when used in
   responses, are only valid in a 200 (OK) response to an INVITE
   request.

5.1.  Procedures at the UAS

   A UAS supporting this specification inserts an Answer-Mode or Priv-
   Answer-Mode header field into the 200 (OK) response to an INVITE
   request when it wishes to inform the UAC as to whether the request
   was answered manually or automatically.  It is reasonable for a UAS
   to assume that if the UAC included an Answer-Mode header field in the
   request that it would probably like to see an Answer-Mode header
   field in the response.  The full rationale for including or not
   including this header field in a response is outside of the scope of
   this specification, and is sensitive to the privacy concerns of the
   user of the UAS.  For example, informing the calling party that a
   call was answered manually might reveal the presence of an "actual
   human" at the responding UAS.  While in the general case the ensuing
   conversation would also reveal this same information, there might be
   cases where this information might need to be protected.
   Consequently, UASes supporting this specification SHOULD include
   appropriately configurable policy mechanisms for making this
   determination, and the default configuration SHOULD be to exclude
   this header field from responses.

5.2.  Procedures at the UAC

   A UAC MAY use the value of the Answer-Mode or Priv-Answer-Mode header
   field, if present, to adapt the user interface and/or inform the user
   about the handling of the request.  For example, the user of a push-
   to-talk system might speak differently if she knows that the called
   party answered "in person" vs. having the call blare out of an
   unattended speaker phone.


6.  Examples of Usage

   The following examples show Bob registering a contact that supports
   the negotiation of answering mode.  Alice then calls Bob with an
   INVITE request, asking for automatic answering and explicitly asking

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


   that the request not be routed to contacts that have not indicated
   support for this extension.  Further, Alice requires that the request
   be rejected if Bob's UA does not support negotiation of answering
   mode.  Bob replies with a 200 (OK) response indicating that the call
   was answered automatically.

      The Content-Length header field shown in the examples contains a
      placeholder "..." instead of a valid Content-Length.  Furthermore,
      the SDP bodies that would be expected in the INVITE requests and
      200 (OK) responses are not shown.

6.1.  REGISTER Request

   In the following example, Bob's UA is registering and indicating that
   it supports the answermode extension.

     REGISTER sip:example.com SIP/2.0

6.2.  INVITE Request

   In this example, Alice is calling Bob and asking Bob's UA to answer
   automatically.  However, Alice is willing for Bob to answer manually
   if Bob's policy is to prefer manual answer.

7.  Security Considerations

   This specification adds the ability for a UAC to request potentially
   risky user interface behavior relating to the acceptance of an INVITE
   request by the UAS receiving the request.  Specifically, the UAC can
   request that the UAS accept the request without input to the UAS by
   the user of the UAS (Answer-Mode: Auto).

   There are several attacks possible here, with the most obvious being
   the ability to turn a phone into a remote listening device without
   its user being aware of it.  Additional potential attacks include
   reverse charge fraud, unsolicited "push to talk" communications (spam
   over push-to-talk or SPTT), playout of obnoxious noises (the "whoopee
   cushion" attack), battery-rundown denial of service, "forced busy"
   denial of service, running up the victim's data transport bill, and
   phishing via session insertion (where an ongoing session is replaced
   by another without the victim's awareness).

   Since SIP implementations do not commonly implement end-to-end
   message protections, this specification is completely dependent on
   transitive security across SIP proxies.  Any misbehaving proxy can
   insert, delete, and/or alter the contents of the Answer-Mode and
   Priv-Answer-Mode header fields, and can in general do so without
   being noticed by either the UAC or UAS.  Consequently, it is critical
   that any proxies in the path be not inly trusted, but worthy of that
   trust.  While proxies do not generally intentionally insert, delete,
   or alter the Answer-Mode and Priv-Answer-Mode header fields, this
   specification does not a use case for such manipulation by proxies
   acting on behalf of the user of a UAC or UAS that has limited support
   for the authentication or policy enforcement needed to securely
   exercise these extensions.  Proxies that perform such extension-

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


   sensitive manipulation MUST therefore provide complete policy
   enforcement, as per the minimal policy discussed in Section 7.

   The existing body of SIP work provides strong capabilities for
   authentication of requests, prevention of man-in-the-middle attacks,
   protecting the privacy and integrity of media flows, and so on
   (although as noted above, these capabilities usually rely on
   transitive trust across proxies).  The behaviors added by the
   extensions in this document raise additional possibilities for
   attacks against media flows not completely addressed by existing SIP
   work, and therefore require analysis in this document.

   Media attacks can be loosely categorized as:


   Insertion:  Media is inserted into and played out by the victim UA
      without consent of the UA's user.

   Interception:  The victim UA's media acquisition facility (such as a
      microphone or camera) is activated, producing a media stream,
      without the consent of the UA's user.

7.1.  Attack Sensitivity Depends on Media Characteristics

   The danger of abuse varies greatly depending on the media
   characteristics of the session being established.  Since the
   expressive range of media sessions that can be established by SIP is
   unbounded, we might find it more effective to model loose categories
   of media modality rather than explicitly describing every possible
   scenario.  Security analysis can then be applied per modality.

   The media modalities of interest appear to be:

   UAC-sourced (Inbound) Unidirectional Media Insertion:  Sensitive
      media flows from the UAC and is rendered by the UAS, annoying the
      user of the UAS or disrupting the function of the UAS.  We refer
      to this as the "whoopee-cushion" attack because of its utility in
      replicating the rude-noise making joke seat cushion.  The danger
      of this attack is quite literally amplified by a loudspeaker
      apparatus attached to the victim UAS.  Media that has minimal
      secondary implication (such as sending a move in a chess game to a
      computer that isn't running a chess game) is related, but of far
      less significance.  This sort of attack can also have other
      consequences, such as discharging the victim's battery or
      increasing charges for data transport to be paid by the victim.

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


   UAS-sourced (Outbound) Unidirectional Media Interception:  Sensitive
      media flows from the UAS and is rendered by the UAC, violating the
      privacy of the user of the UAS.  We refer to this as the "bug-my-
      phone" attack because that would appear to be primary attack
      motivator.


   Bidirectional Media Insertion or Interception:  Bidirectional media
      is the common case when SIP is used in a voice-over-IP scenario or
      "traditional phone call".  Once a media flow is established, both
      ends send and receive media without further engagement.  The media
      information is presumed to be sensitive -- that is, if intercepted
      it damages the victim's privacy, and if inserted, it annoys or
      interferes with the recipient.  Attacks of this sort might produce
      both of the "whoopee-cushion" or the "bug-my-phone" scenarios,
      potentially even simultaneously.

   It seems reasonable to consider the "bug-my-phone" attack as being in
   a different class (potentially far more severe) than the "whoopee-
   cushion" attack.  This distinction suggests that security policy
   could be established in different and presumably less restrictive
   fashion for inbound media flows than for outbound media flows.  The
   set of callers from which a user would be willing to automatically
   accept inbound media is reasonably much broader than the set of
   callers to which a user would be willing to automatically grant
   outbound media access, although this may not be true in all
   environments, especially those where reception of unwanted media has
   unwanted financial consequences.

   For example: Assume a UA is designed such that it can be used to
   receive push-to-talk calls to a loudspeaker, and it can be used as a
   "baby monitor" (has an open mic and streams received audio to
   listeners).  The policy for activating the push-to-talk loudspeaker
   would probably need to be reasonably broad (perhaps "all the user's
   buddies"), but the policy for the baby monitor would need to be very
   narrow (perhaps only "the baby's mother) or even completely closed.
   The minimal policy defined in Section 7.4 explicitly forbids this
   functionality.

7.2.  Application Design Affects Attack Opportunity

   In the most common use cases, the security aspects are somewhat
   mitigated by design aspects of the application.  For example, in
   traditional telephony, the called party is alerted to the request
   (the phone rings), no media session is established without the
   acceptance of the called party (picking up the phone), and the media
   path is most commonly delivered to a single-user handset.
   Consequently, this application (although bidirectional) is relatively



Willis & Allen            Expires March 8, 2008                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


   secure against both media insertion and media interception attacks of
   the sort enabled by the extensions in this document.  The use of
   policy-free automatic-answering devices (like answering machines) and
   amplifiers (speakerphones and call-screening devices) weakens this
   defense.

   In push-to-talk applications, media can be sent from UAC to UAS
   without user oversight, but no media is sent from the called UAS
   without user input (the "push" of "push-to-talk").  Consequently,
   there is no "bug-my-phone" attack opportunity.  Further, screening of
   the UAC by eliminating UAC identities not on some sort of "white
   list" (often, a buddy list) reduces the threat of "whoopee cushion"
   attacks (except from one's buddies, of course).

   Similar approaches apply to most applications.  Insertion can be
   controlled (but not eliminated) by combining identity mechanisms with
   simple authorization policy, and interception can be effectively
   eliminated by combining strong identity mechanisms with aggressive
   authorization policy and/or user interaction.

7.3.  Applying the Analysis

   The extensions described in this document provide mechanisms by which
   a UAC can request that a UAS not deploy two of the five defensive
   mechanisms -- user alerting and user acceptance.  In order for this
   not to produce undue risk of insertion attacks or any increased risk
   of interception attacks, we are therefore forced to rely on the
   remaining defensive mechanisms.  This document defines a minimum
   threshold for satisfactory security.  Certainly more restrictive
   policies might reasonably be used, but any policy less restrictive
   than the approach described below is very likely to result in
   significant security issues.

   From the previous discussion of risks, attacks and vulnerabilities,
   we can derive five defensive mechanisms have five defense mechanisms
   available at the application level:


   1.  Identity -- know who the request came from.

   2.  Alerting -- Let the called user know what's happening.  Some
       applications might use inbound media as an alert.

   3.  Acceptance -- Require called user to make run-time decision.
       Asking the user to make a run-time decision without alerting the
       user to the need to make a decision is generally infeasible.
       This will have implications for possible alerting options that
       are outside the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft             SIP Answering Modes            September 2007


   4.  Limit the I/O -- Turn off loudspeakers or microphone.  This could
       be used to convert a bidirectional media session (very risky,
       possible "bug my phone")into a unidirectional inbound-only (less
       risky, possible "spam" or "rundown", etc. ) session while waiting
       for user acceptance.

   5.  Policy -- rules about other factors, such was black and
       whitelisting based on identity, disallowing acceptance without
       alerting, etc.

   Since SIP and related work already provide several mechanisms
   (including SIP Digest Authentication [RFC3261], the SIP Identity
   mechanism [RFC4474], and the SIP mechanism for asserted identity
   within private networks [RFC3325], in networks for which it is
   suitable) for establishing the identity of the originator of a
   request, we presume that an appropriately selected mechanism is
   available for UAs implementing the extensions described in this
   document.  In short, UAs implementing these extensions MUST be
   equipped with and MUST exercise a request identity mechanism.  The
   analysis below proceeds from an assumption that the identity of the
   sender of each request is either known or is known to be unknown, and
   can therefore be considered in related policy considerations.
   Failure to meet this identity requirement either opens the door to a
   wide range of attacks, or requires operational policy so tight as to
   make these extensions useless.

   We previously established a class distinction between inbound and
   outbound media flows, and can model bidirectional flows as "worst
   case" sums of the risks of the other two classes.  Given this
   distinction, it seems reasonable to provide separate directionality
   policy classes for:


   1.  Inbound media flows.

   2.  Outbound media flows.

   For each directionality policy class, we can divide the set of
   request identities into three classes:


   1.  Identities explicitly authorized for the class.

   2.  Identities explicitly denied for the class.

   3.  Identities for which we have no explicit policy and need the user
       to make a decision.

7.4.  Minimal Policy Requirement

   User agents implementing this specification SHOULD NOT establish a
   session providing inbound media without explicit user acceptance
   where the requesting user is unknown, or is known and has not been
   granted authorization for such a session.  This requirement is
   intended to prevent "SPAM broadcast" attacks" where unexpected and
   unwanted media is played out at a UAS .

   User agents implementing this specification MUST NOT establish a
   session providing outbound or bidirectional media sourced from the
   user agent without explicit user acceptance.  Loopback media used for
   connectivity testing is not constrained by this requirement.  This
   requirement is intended to assure that this extension can not be used
   to turn a UAS into a remote-controlled microphone (or "bug") without
   the knowledge of its user.  Since SIP allows for a session to be
   initially established with inbound-only media and then transitioned
   (via re-INVITE or UPDATE) to an outbound or bidirectional session,
   enforcing this policy requires dialog-stateful inspection in the SIP
   UAS.  In other words, if a session was initiated with automatic
   answering, the UAS MUST NOT transition to a mode that sends outbound
   media without explicit acceptance by the user of the UAS.

9.  Acknowledgements

   This document draws requirements and a large part of its methodology
   from the work of the Open Mobile Alliance, and specifically from an
   Internet Draft by Andrew Allen, Jan Holm, and Tom Hallin.

   The editor would also like to recognize the contributions of David
   Oran and others who argued on the SIPPING mailing list and at the OMA
   ad-hoc meeting at IETF 62 that the underlying ideas of the above
   draft were broadly applicable to the SIP community, and that the
   concepts of alerting and answering should be clearly delineated.

   Further, the security review provided by Sandy Murphy and gen-art
   review by Suresh Krishnan were very helpful in improving the quality
   of the document.
