Internet-Draft          Configuring BFD with DHCP          February 2008


1.  Introduction

   A particularly useful application for BFD [I-D.ietf-bfd-base] is to
   track IP connectivity between dynamically configured endpoints (e.g.
   hosts or CPE) and their IP Edge device (BRAS, BNG etc.)  While IP
   connectivity is typically enabled on endpoints using DHCP [RFC2131]
   or DHCPv6 [RFC3315], there is currently no well-defined procedure for
   autoconfiguring BFD on IP devices to enable forwarding plane failure
   detection.

   BFD runs over IPv4 or IPv6 and can only be initiated on dynamically
   configured endpoints after DHCP configuration is successfully
   completed, for two reasons.  First, an endpoint lacks an IP address
   until configured by DHCP and thus can't be identified by IP network
   and receive BFD packets.  Second, an endpoint lacks knowledge of its
   peer IP devices (e.g. default gateway) and thus can't send BFD
   packets to them.

   The first reason suggests that BFD can not be started up until after
   unconfigured DHCP client obtains a valid network address.  The second
   one implies that BFD requires configuration parameters supplied by
   DHCP for its operation.  Thus, BFD startup must be coordinated with
   DHCP which also supplies BFD parameters.  In short, BFD must be
   provisioned by DHCP on DHCP-configured endpoints.

   In turn, BFD can be used to enhance behavior of DHCP client by
   notifying it about loss of IP connectivity with IP Edge.  While DHCP
   client operation upon L2 link failure is well-defined and is designed
   to verify network configuration as soon as connectivity is restored,
   similar functionality is absent for loss of L3.  Ability by a DHCP
   client to initiate negotiation upon detecting an IP connectivity
   failure can be very useful in broadband scenarios.  The document
   discusses a BFD-based mechanism to that effect.


2.  BFD Provisioning on IP Endpoint

   Currently, there is no mechanism for DHCP to configure BFD parameters
   on an IP endpoint.  BFD can be enabled only if BFD parameters are
   hard-wired (pre-provisioned) on a device or provided by some out-of-
   band mechanism like the one specified in DSLF TR-069 [TR-069].  We
   suggest defining new DHCP options that would carry BFD specific
   configuration parameters and facilitate autoconfiguration of BFD on a
   DHCP-enabled endpoint.

Internet-Draft          Configuring BFD with DHCP          February 2008


2.1.  New DHCP Options Inserted by Client

   Option TBD_1 MAY be used by DHCPv4 client in DHCPDISCOVER,
   DHCPREQUEST or DHCPINFORM packets to advertise BFD support on an IP
   endpoint.  The format of the option TBD_1 is:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | Code (TBD_1)  |  Length       |Vers |Reserved | Num Auth Types|
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |       A1      |      A2       |  ...                          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   An equivalent option TBD_2 MAY be used by DHCPv6 client in SOLICIT,
   REQUEST, CONFIRM, RENEW, REBIND, and INFORMATON_REQUEST packets to
   advertise BFD support on an IP endpoint.  The format of the option
   TBD_2 is:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |          Code (TBD_2)         |             Length            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |Vers |Reserved | Num Auth Types|      A1       |       A2      |

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   In both options TBD_1 and TBD_2 "Vers" stands for the version of BFD
   supported on the endpoint running DHCP client.  BFD version should be
   currently set to 1 according to [I-D.ietf-bfd-base].  "Num Auth
   Types" is the number of BFD Authentication types supported by the IP
   endpoint.  If client does not support BFD Authentication, the field
   MUST be set to 0.  Finally, A1, A2. etc are the codes of BFD
   Authentication types supported by the endpoint as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-base].

2.2.  New DHCP Options Inserted by Server

   When a DHCPv4 packet containing option TBD_1 is received by a DHCPv4
   server, the server MAY configure BFD on the endpoint running the
   client if it supports version of BFD requested by the client.  If
   DHCP server cannot supply BFD configuration for BFD version that IP
   endpoint is running, the server SHOULD NOT configure BFD on the
   endpoint.  To deliver BFD configuration to the endpoint, the server
   inserts option TBD_3 into DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK packets.  The format
   of the option TBD_3 is:

   If option TBD_1 specifies support for BFD Authentication, the server
   MAY supply an Authentication Section.  The format of Authentication
   Section is as follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                              ...                              |

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Here "Auth Len" is the length of Authentication Section and "Num
   Keys" is the number of authentication keys to be used during the
   session.  Then follows the authentication key definition in a
   modified TLV format - in addition to Type an Authentication Key ID is
   provided for each key.  Codes for Authentication types MUST be
   consistent with [I-D.ietf-bfd-base].  If Authentication Section is
   present it MUST immediately follow Remote IP Address field.

   If "Num Auth Types" field in option TBD_1 is set to 0, the server
   SHOULD NOT supply Authentication Section in option TBD_3.  The server
   SHOULD only configure Authentication types that the endpoint
   supports.

   Likewise, when a DHCPv6 server receives a packet containing option

   TBD_2, it MAY choose to configure BFD on the endpoint if it supports
   version of BFD requested by the client.  To deliver BFD configuration
   to the endpoint the server inserts option TBD_4 into ADVERTISE,
   REPLY, or RECONFIGURE packets.  The format of the option TBD_4 is:

        0                   1                   2                   3

Internet-Draft          Configuring BFD with DHCP          February 2008


   Definitions of all parameters (except for remote IP address) can be
   found in [I-D.ietf-bfd-base].

   In order for BFD configuration in option TBD_3 or TBD_4 to be
   accepted by an IP endpoint, BFD Version field MUST match BFD version
   supported by the endpoint and provided to DHCP server in option TBD_1
   or TBD_2.  If BFD versions do not match configuration MUST be
   discarded by the endpoint.  Currently the version should be set to 1
   according to [I-D.ietf-bfd-base].

   Enable bit (E) set to 1 indicates that BFD on the endpoint SHOULD be
   enabled.  If Enable bit is set to 0, BFD MUST NOT be initiated.  If
   BFD is already running, it SHOULD be disabled.

   Default values define an IP endpoint as a passive BFD peer running in
   Asynchronous mode without Authentication.  Authentication Present Bit
   (A) set to 1 indicates the presence of the optional Authentication
   Section.  Asynchronous mode is selected as default because Demand
   mode requires some mechanism outside of BFD to generate polls toward
   the peer.  Numeric values of Detect Multiplier and Desired Min TX
   interval are selected as being consistent with PPP keepalive default
   values that are relevant for broadband scenarios.  Required Min RX
   intervals are set to 1 second as sub-second detection times are not
   currently expected in broadband scenarios.  The failure detection
   time of 3 seconds (given the suggested default Detect Multiplier
   value) on IP Edge would represent an order of magnitude improvement
   over the current industry default of 30s (the typical failure
   detection time for PPP).

   Value 0 for Required min Echo RX Interval indicates that Echo mode is
   not supported by an endpoint.  This reflects the expectation that
   Echo mode is not typically used in broadband scenarios.

   C-bit value depends on BFD implementation on an endpoint; the default
   value of 0 assumes that the endpoint's control plane and forwarding
   plane share fate.

   Remote IP address cannot be initialized with a meaningful default
   value.  As explained in Section 4 (Section 4), BFD operation is
   undefined until DHCP negotiation is completed at which point remote
   IP address will be set to a value extracted from option TBD_3 or
   TBD_4.

   Authentication data is not supplied by default.  If Authentication
   Section is present, IP endpoint MUST discard configuration for BFD
   Authentication types that it does not support.

   Note that these parameters can be pre-provisioned or configured by

   some out-of-band mechanism as well as by DHCP.  Therefore, precedence
   rules must be defined to resolve conflicts when a device is
   configured by several methods at once.  Section 6 (Section 6) defines
   and discusses these rules.

   When DHCP client receives DHCPACK with a properly formed option
   TBD_3, or REPLY or RECONFIGURE with a properly formed option TBD_4,
   the BFD parameters in the respective option MUST be used to
   initialize and start up BFD on the endpoint according to
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-base] and [I-D.ietf-bfd-v4v6-1hop] and using precedence
   rules specified in Section 6 (Section 6), provided Enable bit is set
   1 and BFD version in the configuration matches BFD version supported
   by the endpoint.  BFD state is initially set to Down, and destination
   IP address for BFD packets is set to the Remote IP address from
   option TBD_3 or TBD_4.  Subsequent BFD operation on the endpoint is
   fully defined by BFD state machine as described in
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-base].

2.4.  Operation with DHCP Relay Agent

   In some deployments, IP Edge device serving as BFD endpoint is
   configured as a DHCPv4 relay agent.  In this case, it may be
   preferable for an operator to program BFD endpoint configuration on
   the DHCP relay rather than the server.  Relay agent can not insert
   BFD configuration into DHCP packets directly: the only manipulations
   a relay agent is allowed to perform on DHCP packets is setting giaddr
   and inserting relay-agent-info option.  Therefore, in order to allow
   DHCP relay to provide an IP endpoint BFD configuration to the server,
   there is a need to extend the relay-agent-info option ([RFC3046])
   with a new sub-option, the bfd-endpoint sub-option.  The new sub-
   option has the same format as option TBD_3, except it employs a
   different code (TBD_5):

Internet-Draft          Configuring BFD with DHCP          February 2008


   The relay agent MAY insert the bfd-endpoint sub-option into
   DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST packet from an IP endpoint if it would
   like the server to use its BFD configuration to configure BFD on the
   endpoint.  If the server supports BFD provisioning and detects bfd-
   endpoint sub-option it MUST use BFD configuration from the sub-option
   in option TBD_3 that it inserts into DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK packets.

   DHCPv4 server MAY be configured to supply BFD configuration to the
   client only if bfd-endpoint sub-option is present in a DHCPDISCOVER
   or DHCPREQUEST packet.  However, in a general case, the presence of
   the sub-option does not directly influence the server's decision to
   insert option TBD_3 in a packet; rather it places a requirement on
   the content of the option if the server chooses to insert it.  For
   example, whether or not bfd-endpoint sub-option is present in
   DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST, the server MUST NOT insert option TBD_3
   in DHCPOFFER or DHCPACK if option TBD_1 was not supplied by the
   client.  This is consistent with usage of other sub-options of relay-
   agent-info option.

   Similarly, an operator may wish to program BFD endpoint configuration
   on a DHCPv6 relay agent rather than the server.  To enable DHCPv6
   server to use BFD endpoint configuration provided by a relay agent,
   the relay agent MAY insert option TBD_4 into RELAY_FORW packet that
   it sends to the server upon receiving SOLICIT, REQUEST, CONFIRM,
   RENEW, REBIND, or INFORMATON_REQUEST packet from an IP endpoint.  If
   a server detects option TBD_4 in RELAY_FORW it MUST insert it
   unchanged into respective client message that is subsequently
   appended to RELAY_REPL packet, provided option TBD_2 is present in
   the original client packet.  Relay agent then transparently passes
   ADVERTISE, REPLY, or RECONFIGURE message with embedded option TBD_4
   to the client.

3.  BFD Provisioning and Management on IP Edge

   BFD provisioning on IP Edge is not done via DHCP; it is a
   responsibility of IP Edge operator and is out of scope of this
   document.  Likewise, DHCP is not responsible for configuring Remote
   IP address provided to IP endpoint in option TBD_3 or TBD_4 on IP
   Edge.

   IP Edge is expected to be the active BFD peer (BFD role on the
   endpoint is Passive by default, see Section 2.3 (Section 2.3)).  If
   BFD on an endpoint is provisioned via DHCP, IP Edge configured as
   DHCP server or relay agent can initiate BFD session with the endpoint
   immediately after completion of DHCP messaging.  This is an

Internet-Draft          Configuring BFD with DHCP          February 2008


   additional benefit of the DHCP based BFD configuration: any other
   provisioning method, e.g. via an ACS server ([TR-069]) is
   asynchronous with IP connectivity establishment between IP Edge and
   the endpoint and does not give IP Edge any an indication of BFD
   availability on the endpoint.

   While DHCP module on IP Edge MAY assist with the timing of BFD
   session initiation, it is not a bootstrapping or management client of
   BFD.  BFD does not inform DHCP server or relay of BFD failures and
   thus does not influence the state of IP address lease by the
   endpoint.


4.  BFD and IP Address Lifecycle

4.1.  BFD and DHCPv4 Client States

   BFD can operate on an endpoint for as long as IP address lease by
   DHCP client is valid.  If lease renewal fails for some reason and
   DHCPv4 client transitions to DHCP INIT state, BFD MUST be disabled.
   Subsequently, BFD can only be re-enabled upon successful DHCP
   renegotiation and DHCP transitioning into BOUND state.

   BFD MAY be initiated by DHCP client upon its transitioning into BOUND
   state provided a valid option TBD_3 is received by the client in a
   DHCPv4 packet.  BFD is disabled by DHCP client when the DHCPv4 client
   transitions into INIT state.

   Thus, BFD can run on an IP endpoint configured by DHCP when DHCP
   client is in BOUND, RENEWING, REBINDING, INIT-REBOOT and REBOOTING
   states only.  In DHCP INIT, SELECTING and REQUESTING states BFD
   operation is undefined.

4.2.  BFD and DHCPv6 Client

   DHCPv6 does not have a formal state machine like DHCPv4.  Therefore,
   BFD operation on an IPv6 endpoint running DHCPv6 client is best
   described in relation to the lifecycle of IPv6 address lease.  As
   with DHCPv4, BFD can only run on an IPv6 endpoint wit ha valid IPv6
   address.  If IP address lease expires BFD MUST be disabled.  BFD MAY
   be enabled when a configuration with a valid IPv6 address is applied
   on the endpoint, provided BFD configuration is supplied in option
   TBD_4 or by some other means.

   It is possible that IPv6 endpoints running DHCPv6 client use SLAAC to
   obtain their network address.  Such endpoints could still use DHCPv6
   for BFD configuration.  Specifically, once an endpoint is configured
   with an IPv6 address, it MAY send an INFORMATION-REQUEST message with

Internet-Draft          Configuring BFD with DHCP          February 2008


   an option TBD_2.  Processing by the server or relay agent should be
   the same in this case as for a regular DHCPv6 client.  The contents
   of Section 2 (Section 2) fully applies to this situation.


5.  BFD Failure and DHCP Client

   If BFD on an IP endpoint is configured using DHCP options TBD_3 or
   TBD_4, DHCP client is a client application of BFD in the sense of
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-generic].  Thus, BFD events, e.g. unplanned BFD
   failures SHOULD be reported to DHCP client.  If BFD on an endpoint
   detects a planned failure, e.g. the BFD peer transition to AdminDown
   state, DHCP client SHOULD NOT be informed.  Decision of whether or
   not to inform DHCP MAY be based on BFD Diag code.

   Modern Access and Aggregation networks connecting dynamically
   configured endpoints and their IP Edge device can be quite complex
   and have non-trivial redundancy behavior designed to minimize service
   interruptions.  Given that DHCP packets are often used for subscriber
   line authentication and session establishment, some self-healing
   network designs may rely on DHCP message exchange initiated upon
   connectivity interruption between IP Edge and an endpoint.  However,
   DHCP exchanges initiated by DHCP servers are typically disallowed in
   broadband scenarios for security reasons and a mechanism informing
   DHCP client of IP connectivity loss with the network is currently
   missing.

   BFD running on an endpoint provides such mechanism.  Unplanned BFD
   failure on an endpoint indicates loss of IP connectivity with IP
   Edge.  Therefore, indication of unplanned BFD failure can be used by
   DHCP client to react to interruptions in IP connectivity in the same
   way as is currently specified for L2 loss.

   If IP endpoint is running DHCPv4 client, the client MAY transition
   into INIT-REBOOT state upon receiving a notification of BFD failure.
   If IP endpoint is running DHCPv6 client, the client MAY consider loss
   of BFD to be equivalent to loss of L2, and initiate a Confirm
   messages exchange as described in section 18.1.2 of [RFC3315].  The
   exact behavior of DHCP client upon receiving unplanned BFD failure
   notification is determined by the operator and is outside the scope
   of this document.


6.  Other BFD Initialization Methods

   BFD on an IP endpoint can be pre-provisioned or configured by
   mechanisms other than DHCP, e.g. manually or via ACS per DSLF TR-069
   [TR-069].  As DHCP-based BFD configuration is initiated by the

Internet-Draft          Configuring BFD with DHCP          February 2008


   endpoint using DHCP option TBD_1 or TBD_2, it is expected that, once
   this provisioning mode is selected, no other mechanisms to configure
   BFD will be used.

   If BFD has been pre-provisioned on an IP endpoint, DHCP-based
   configuration SHOULD override pre-provisioned BFD configuration with
   the exception of Control Plane Independent (C) Bit. Proper setting of
   C bit requires knowledge of BFD implementation on the endpoint and
   thus pre-provisioned value is more reliable than the one supplied by
   DHCP.  Likewise, BFD initialization information in option TBD_3 or
   TBD_4 SHOULD override any BFD configuration present on an IP endpoint
   at the time of DHCP negotiation, with the exception of C-bit, no
   matter what its origin is.

   In particular, if Enable bit in the option TBD_3 or TBD_4 in a DHCP
   packet received by the endpoint is set to 0, BFD MUST NOT be
   initiated even if BFD configuration has been pre-provisioned by other
   means.  In case BFD is already running by the time options TBD_3 or
   TBD_4 are received with Enable bit set to 0, BFD SHOULD be disabled
   no matter what the origin of its configuration is.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to allocate option and sub-option codes
   for newly defined DHCP options and sub-options as described in the
   text.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


8.  Security Considerations

   The configuration of BFD by DHCP is subject to the same security
   concerns as is the configuration of an endpoint by DHCP in general;
   these are outlined in [RFC2131].  Potentially, a malicious user
   snooping on DHCP interaction between IP Edge and an endpoint can
   retrieve BFD discriminator values and authentication keys and hijack
   the BFD session.  This can lead to temporary disruption of IP
   connectivity for the endpoint.

   However, hijacking of the endpoint network address and of the IP
   connection itself is of much bigger concern as this presents a far
   greater opportunity for service disruption and theft.  Therefore,
   while the new mechanism for BFD configuration is as vulnerable as
   DHCP itself, it does not present an increased security risk.
