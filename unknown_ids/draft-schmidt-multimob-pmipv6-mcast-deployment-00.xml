    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) <xref target="RFC5213"></xref> extends
      Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC3775"></xref> by network-based management
      functions that enable IP mobility for a host without requiring its
      participation in any mobility-related signaling. Additional network
      entities, i.e., the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA), and Mobile Access
      Gateways (MAGs), are responsible for managing IP mobility on behalf of
      the mobile node (MN).</t>

      <t>With these routing entities in place, the mobile node looses
      transparent end-to-end connectivity to the static Internet, and in the
      particular case of multicast communication, group membership management
      as signaled by the Multicast Listener Discovery protocol <xref
      target="RFC3810"></xref>, <xref target="RFC2710"></xref> requires a
      dedicated treatment, see <xref
      target="I-D.deng-multimob-pmip6-requirement"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Multicast routing functions need a careful placement within the
      PMIPv6 domain to augment unicast transmission with group communication
      services. <xref target="RFC5213"></xref> does not explicitly address
      multicast communication, whereas bi-directional home tunneling, the
      minimal multicast support arranged by MIPv6, cannot be applied in
      network-based management scenarios: A mobility-unaware node will
      experience no reason to initiate a tunnel with an entity of mobility
      support.</t>

      <t>This document describes deployment options for activating multicast
      listener functions in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains without modifying
      mobility and multicast protocol standards. Similar to Home Agents in
      Mobile IPv6, PMIPv6 Local Mobility Anchors serve as multicast
      subscription anchor points, while Mobile Access Gateways provide MLD
      proxy functions. Mobile Nodes in this scenario remain agnostic of
      multicast mobility operations. Accrediting the problem space of
      multicast mobility <xref target="I-D.irtf-mobopts-mmcastv6-ps"></xref>,
      this document does not address optimization potentials and efficiency
      improvements of multicast routing in network-centered mobility, as such
      solutions would require changes to the base specification of <xref
      target="RFC5213"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This document uses the terminology as defined for the mobility
      protocols <xref target="RFC3775"></xref> and <xref target="RFC5213">

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>An MN in a PMIPv6 domain will decide on multicast group membership
      management completely independent of its current mobility conditions. It
      will submit MLD Report and Done messages following application desires,
      thereby using its link-local source address and multicast destinations
      according to <xref target="RFC3810"></xref>, or <xref target="RFC2710">
      </xref>. These link-local signaling messages will arrive at the
      currently active MAG via one of its downstream local (wireless) links. A
      multicast unaware MAG would simply discard these MLD messages.</t>

      <t>To facilitate multicast in a PMIPv6 domain, an MLD proxy function
      <xref target="RFC4605"></xref> needs to be deployed on the MAG that
      selects the tunnel interface corresponding to the MN's LMA for its
      upstream interface (cf., section 6 of <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>).
      Thereby each LMA upstream interface defines an MLD proxy domain at the
      MAG, containing all downstream links to MNs that share this LMA. MLD
      signaling of the MN will be consequently forwarded up the tunnel
      interface to its corresponding LMA.</t>

      <t>Serving as the designated multicast router or an additional MLD
      proxy, the LMA will transpose any MLD messages of the MN into the
      multicast routing infrastructure. Correspondingly, the LMA will
      implement appropriate multicast forwarding states at its tunnel
      interface. Traffic arriving for groups under subscription will arrive at
      the LMA, which it will forward according to all its group/source states.
      In addition, the LMA will naturally act as an MLD querier, seeing its
      downstream tunnel interfaces as multicast enabled links.</t>

      <t>At the MAG, MLD queries and multicast data will arrive on the
      (tunnel) interface that is assigned to a group of access links as
      identified by its Binding Update List (cf., section 6 of <xref
      target="RFC5213"></xref>). As specified for MLD proxies, the MAG will
      forward multicast traffic and related signaling down the appropriate
      access links to the MNs. In proceeding this way, all multicast-related
      signaling and the corresponding traffic will transparently flow from the
      LMA to the MN on an LMA-specific shared tree.</t>

      <t>In case of a mobility handover, the (IP mobility unaware) MN will
      refrain from submitting unsolicited MLD reports. Instead, the LMA is
      required to maintain group memberships in the following way. On the
      reception of a Proxy Binding Update (PBU) from the new MAG and
      successful Re-Binding, the LMA re-establishes a route to the MN's home
      network prefix over the tunnel interface corresponding to the new MAG
      (cf., section 5.3 of <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>).</t>

      <t>After Re-Binding, the LMA SHOULD issue a general MLD query on the new
      tunnel link to refresh forwarding requirements. Queries can be omitted,
      if multicast forwarding states previously established at the tunnel
      interface towards the new MAG form a superset of those present at the
      old tunnel interface. The LMA SHOULD likewise perform a general MLD
      query after receiving a Binding De-Registration at a tunnel interface
      that is to be maintained. The LMA MAY reduce the need for queries when
      it applies explicit tracking in combination with <xref
      target="RFC3810"></xref>.</t>

      <t>These multicast deployment considerations likewise apply for mobile
      nodes that operate with its IPv4 stack enabled in a PMIPv6 domain.
      PMIPv6 can provide an IPv4 home address mobility support <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support"></xref>. Such mobile node
      will use IGMPv3 <xref target="RFC3376"></xref> signaling for multicast,
      which is handled by an IGMP proxy function at the MAG in an analogous
      way.</t>

      <t>Following these deployment steps, multicast management transparently
      interoperates with PMIPv6. It is worth noting that multicast streams can
      possibly be distributed on redundant path, leading to duplicate traffic
      arriving from different LMAs at one MAG, and causing multiple data
      transmissions from a MAG over one wireless domain to different MNs.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Deployment Details">
      <t>Multicast activation in a PMIPv6 domain requires to deploy general
      multicast functions at PMIPv6 routers and to define its interaction with
      the PMIPv6 protocol in the following way:</t>

      <section title="Operations of the Mobile Node">
        <t>A Mobile Node willing to manage multicast traffic will join,
        maintain and leave groups as if located in the fixed Internet. No
        specific mobility actions nor implementations are required at the
        MN.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operations of the Mobile Access Gateway">
        <t>A Mobility Access Gateway is required to assist in MLD signaling
        and data forwarding between the MNs which it serves, and the
        corresponding LMAs associated to each MN. It therefore needs to
        implement an instance of the MLD proxy function <xref
        target="RFC4605"></xref> for each upstream tunnel interface that has
        been established with an LMA. The MAG decides on the mapping of
        downstream links to a proxy instance (and hence an upstream link to an
        LMA) based on the regular Binding Update List as maintained by PMIPv6
        standard operations (cf., section 6.1 of <xref
        target="RFC5213"></xref>).</t>

        <t>On the reception of MLD reports from an MN, the MAG MUST identify
        the corresponding proxy instance from the incoming interface and
        perform regular MLD proxy operations: it will insert/update/remove a
        multicast forwarding state on the incoming interface and forward the
        report to its upstream tunnel. Conversely on the reception of MLD
        queries, the MAG proxy instance will transfer the queries to its
        appropriate downstream interfaces. Multicast traffic arriving on an
        upstream interface at the MAG will be forwarded according to the
        group/source-specific forwarding states as acquired for each
        downstream interface within the MLD proxy instance.</t>

        <t>In case of a mobility handover, the MAG will continue to manage
        upstream tunnels and downstream interfaces as foreseen in the PMIPv6
        specification. However, it MUST assure consistency of its up- and
        downstream interfaces that change under mobility with MLD proxy
        instances and its multicast forwarding states.</t>

        <t>In proceeding this way, the MAG is entitled to aggregate multicast
        subscriptions for each of its MLD proxy instances. However, this
        deployment approach does not prevent multiple identical streams
        arriving from different LMA upstream interfaces. Furthermore, a per
        group forwarding into the wireless domain is restricted to the link
        model in use.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operations of the Local Mobility Anchor">
        <t>For any MN, the Local Mobility Anchor acts as the persistent Home
        Agent and at the same time as the default multicast querier. It
        implements the function of the designated multicast router or a
        further MLD proxy. According to MLD reports received from MNs (via
        MAGs), it establishes/maintains/removes group/source-specific
        multicast forwarding states at its downstream tunnel interfaces
        established with MAGs, and at the same time procures for aggregated
        multicast membership maintenance at its upstream interface. Based on
        the multicast-transparent operations of the MAGs, the LMA experiences
        its tunnel interfaces as multicast enabled downstream links serving
        zero to many listening nodes. Multicast traffic arriving at the LMA is
        transparently forwarded according to its multicast forwarding states.
        The LMA MAY choose to apply explicit node tracking in combination with
        MLDv2 <xref target="RFC3810"></xref>.</t>

        <t>On the occurrence of a mobility handover, the LMA will receive
        Binding Lifetime De-Registrations and Binding Lifetime Extensions that
        will cause a re-mapping of home network prefixes to Proxy-CoAs in its
        Binding Cache. Correspondingly, the multicast forwarding states
        require updating, as well. In the absence of explicit tracking, the
        LMA MUST proceed as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Issue a general multicast query on a tunnel interface that is
            to be maintained even though a De-Registration was received.
            Update the multicast forwarding states according to the query
            outcome.</t>

            <t>Issue a general multicast query on a tunnel interface at which
            a Lifetime Extension was received from a new Proxy-CoA, if the
            multicast forwarding states at this interface do not form a
            superset of the states established at the interface corresponding
            to the previous Proxy-CoA.</t>
          </list>For multicast membership queries, two cases need
        distinction:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>LMA multicast membership maintenance is unaffected by the
            handover-related absence of the MN: In this case, the LMA actively
            maintains states and continues to transmit multicast packets to
            the down-tunnel towards the MN. The PMIPv6 protocol will transfer
            the tunnel endpoints and access link binding states between
            previous and new MAG, such that the MN can simply continue to
            receive its group traffic under subscription. Service
            interruptions are bound to the handover discontinuities
            experienced for PMIPv6 unicast transmission.</t>

            <t>A MN may be unable to answer LMA multicast membership queries
            due to handover procedures. Such instance is equivalent to a
            general query loss. To prevent erroneous query timeouts at the
            LMA, MLD parameters SHOULD be carefully adjusted to the mobility
            regime. In particular, MLD timers and the Robustness Variable (see
            section 9 of <xref target="RFC3810"></xref>) MUST be chosen to be
            compliant with the temporal handover operations of the PMIPv6
            domain.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In proceeding this way, each LMA will provide transparent multicast
        support for the group of MNs it serves. It will perform traffic
        aggregation at the MN-group level and will assure that multicast data
        streams are uniquely forwarded per individual LMA-to-MAG tunnel.</t>
