1.  Introduction

   This document enumerates IANA allocations for MANET WG protocols.  A
   well-known UDP port for MANET WG protocols.  Well-known link-local
   multicast addresses (IPv4 & IPv6) for link-local communication
   between neighboring MANET routers.


2.  UDP Port for MANET Protocols

   MANET routing protocols require a well-known UDP port to send and
   receive MANET routing protocol packets.  The title of this UDP port
   is "manet".  The value of this UPD port is TBD1.


3.  Link-local Multicast Group for MANET Routers

   MANET protocols require a well-known link-local multicast address
   [RFC4291] to send and receive MANET routing protocol packets.  The
   name of the multicast address to reach link-local (LL) MANET routers
   is "LL MANET Routers".

   MANET routers will use this well-known LL scoped multicast address to
   receive routing protocol packets and use it for LL transmissions of
   routing protocol packets.

   For IPv4, a well-known, link-local scope multicast address is used.
   The address for LL MANET Routers is 224.0.0.TBD2 to appear in the
   [IANAv4Multicast] registry.

   For IPv6, a well-known, link-local scope multicast address is used.
   The address for LL MANET Routers is FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:TBD3 to appear
   in the [IANAv6Multicast] registry.
