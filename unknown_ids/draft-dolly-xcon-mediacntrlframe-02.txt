Abstract

   This document provides requirements for a protocol, that will enable
   one physical entity that includes the media policy server,
   notification server and the focus to interact with one or more
   physical entities that serves as mixer or media server.  It will
   address all phases and aspects of media handling in a conferencing
   service including announcements and IVR functionality.

Internet-Draft     Media Control Protocol Requirements         June 2006


1.  Overview

   The IETF XCON conferencing framework presents an architecture that is
   built of several functional entities.  The framework document does
   not specify the protocols between the functional entities since it is
   considered out of scope.

   There is an interest to work on a protocol that will enable one
   physical entity that includes the media policy server, notification
   server and the focus to interact with one or more physical entities
   that serves as mixer or media server.

   The document will present the requirements for such a protocol.  It
   will address all phases and aspects of media handling in a enhanced
   conferencing service including announcements and IVR functionality.
   The following items are out of scope of this document:
      Mechanism for MS to advertise its capabilities and other
      attributes (e.g, Geolocation).
      Mechanism for the AS to discover a MS.
      Ability to move an existing conference from the current Media
      Servers supporting it to other Media Servers, where the latter
      have been identified to the AS.


2.  Terminology

   The Media Server work uses when appropriate and expands on the
   terminology introduced in the SIP conferencing framework and XCON
   conferencing framework.  The following additional terms are defined
   for use within the Media Server work.

   Application Server (AS) - The application server includes the
   conference policy server, the focus and the conference notification
   server as defined in draft-ietf-sipping-conferencing-framework.

   Media Server (MS) - The media server includes the mixer as defined in
   draft-ietf-sipping-conferencing-framework.  The media server source
   media streams for announcements, it process media streams for
   functions like DTMF detection and transcoding.  The media server may
   also record media streams for supporting IVR functions like
   announcing participants

   Notification - A notification is used when there is a need to report
   event related information from the MS to the AS.

   Request - A request is sent from the controlling entity, such as an
   Application Server, to another resource, such as a Media Server,
   asking that a particular type of operation be executed.

Internet-Draft     Media Control Protocol Requirements         June 2006


   Response - A response is used to signal information such as an
   acknowledgement or error code in reply to a previously issued
   request.

   Need to add additional definitions


3.  Requirements

3.1.  Media Control Requirements

   The following are the media control requirements:

   REQ-MCP-01 - There MUST be a requirement for a control protocol that
      will enable one or more Application Servers to control a media
      server.

   REQ-MCP-02 The protocol MUST be independent from the transport
      protocol.

   REQ-MCP-03 The protocol MUST use a reliable transport protocol.

   REQ-MCP-04 - The application scope of the protocol shall include
      Enhanced Conferencing Control and Interactive Voice Response.

   Though the protocol enables these services, the functionality is
   invoked through other mechanisms.

   REQ-MCP-05 - The protocol will utilize an XML markup language.

   REQ-MCP-06 - A Media Server SHOULD be application/service
      independent.  It should be possible to have a many-to-many
      relationship between Application Servers and Media Servers that
      use this protocol.

   REQ-MCP-07 - Media types that are supported in the context of the
      applications shall include audio, tones, text and video.

   REQ-MCP-08 - The protocol should allow, but must not require, a media
      server resource broker or intermediate proxy to exist between the
      Application Server and Media Server.

   REQ-MCP-09 - The solution MUST enable one control channel between an
      AS and MS, and shall allow for the support of multiple channels.

   One channel could control multiple conferences, but you could have
   multiple channels controlling one or more conferences.

Internet-Draft     Media Control Protocol Requirements         June 2006


   There can be a connection per conference or one connection from the
   AS to MS for controlling many conferences

   REQ-MCP-10 - On the control channel, there shall be requests to the
      MS, responses from the MS and notifications to the AS.

   REQ-MCP-11 - SIP/SDP SHALL be used to establish and modify RTP
      connections to a Media Server.

   REQ-MCP-12 - It should be possible to support a single conference
      spanning multiple Media Servers.
      Note: The previous draft used "must".  It is probably true that
      spanning multiple MSes can be accomplished by the AS and does not
      require anything in the protocol for the scenarios we have in
      mind.  However, the concern is that if this requirement is treated
      too lightly, one may end up with a protocol that precludes its
      support.  Therefore, we are reluctant to weaken this requirement
      any further than "should".

   REQ-MCP-13 - It must be possible to split call legs individually or
      in groups away from a main conference on a given Media Server,
      without performing SIP re-establishment of the call legs to the MS
      (e.g., for purposes such as performing IVR with a single call leg
      or creating sub-conferences, not for creating entirely new
      conferences).

   REQ-MCP-14 - The protocol should be extendable, facilitating forward
      and backward compatibility.

   REQ-MCP-15 - The protocol shall include security mechanisms.

   REQ-MCP-16 - During session establishment, there shall be a
      capability to negotiate parameters that are associated with media
      streams.

   REQ-MCP-17 - The AS shall be able to define operations that the MS
      will perform on streams like mute and gain control.

   REQ-MCP-18 - The AS shall be able to instruct the MS to play a
      specific announcement.

   REQ-MCP-19 - The MS shall be able to retrieve announcements from an
      external connection.

Internet-Draft     Media Control Protocol Requirements         June 2006


   REQ-MCP-20 - The MS shall be able to request the MS to create,
      delete, and manipulate a mixing, IVR or announcement session.

   REQ-MCP-21 - The AS shall be able to tell the MS if the message can
      be delayed if the MS cannot play it immediately.

   REQ-MCP-22 - The AS shall be able to instruct the MS to play
      announcements to a single user or to a conference mix.

3.2.

   Media Mixing Requirements are for further discussion.

3.3.  Operational Requirements

   REQ-MCP-23 - The AS-MS control protocol must allow the AS to audit
      the MS state, during an active session.

   REQ-MCP-24 - The MS shall be able to inform the AS about its status
      during an active session.


4.  Security Considerations

   As an XML markup, all of the security considerations of RFC3023
   [RFC3023] and RFC3406 [RFC3406] must be met.  Pay particular
   attention to the robustness requirements of parsing XML.

   The protocol shall include security mechanisms.


5.  Changes from Version-01

   The document was updated per the notes from the BOF meeting in March,
   and comments from Roni Even.
