Abstract

   This document gives information on an RTCP XR Block Type and
   associated SDP parameter for inter-destination media synchronization
   (IDMS). The RTCP Block Type, registered with IANA based on an ETSI
   specification, is used to collect media play-out information from
   participants in a group playing-out (watching, listening, etc.) a
   specific RTP media stream and to distribute a summary of the
   collected information so that the participants can synchronize play-
   out.

   Typical applications for inter-destination media synchronization are
   social TV, shared service control (i.e. applications where two or
   more geographically separated users are watching a media stream
   together), distance learning, network quiz shows, multi-playing
   online games, etc.

1. Introduction

1.1. Inter-destination Media Synchronization

   Inter-destination media synchronization (IDMS) refers to the play-out
   of media streams at two or more geographically distributed locations
   in a temporally synchronized manner. It can be applied to both
   unicast and multicast media streams and can be applied to any type
   and/or combination of streaming media, such as audio, video and text
   (subtitles). [Boronat2009] provides an overview of technologies and
   algorithms for IDMS.

   IDMS requires the exchange of information on media receipt and
   playout times. It may also require signaling for the initiation and
   maintenance of IDMS sessions and groups.

   The presented RTCP-XR specification for IDMS is independent of the
   used synchronization algorithm, which is out-of-scope of this
   document.

1.2. Applicability of RTCP to IDMS

   Currently, most multimedia applications make use of RTP and RTCP
   [RFC3550]. RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) provides end-to-end
   network transport functions suitable for applications requiring real-
   time data transport, such as audio, video or data, over multicast or
   unicast network services. The timestamps and sequence number
   mechanisms provided by RTP are very useful to reconstruct the
   original media timing, reorder and detect some packet loss at the
   receiver side.

   The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow
   monitoring of the data delivery in a manner that is scalable to large
   multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification
   functionality.

   RTP receivers and senders provide reception quality feedback by
   sending out RTCP Receiver Report (RR) and Sender Report (SR) packets
   [RFC3550] respectively, which may be augmented by eXtended Reports
   (XR) [RFC3611]. Thus, the feedback reporting features provided by
   RTCP make QoS monitoring possible and can be used for troubleshooting
   and fault tolerance management in multicast distribution services,
   such as IPTV.

   These protocols are intended to be tailored through modification
   and/or additions in order to include profile-specific information
   required by particular applications, and the guidelines on doing so
   are specified in [RFC5968].

Internet-Draft              RTCP for IDMS                  January 2011


   IDMS involves the collection, summarizing and distribution of RTP
   packet arrival and play-out times. As information on RTP packet
   arrival times and play-out times can be considered reception quality
   feedback information, RTCP becomes a promising candidate for carrying
   out IDMS, which may facilitate implementation in typical multimedia
   applications.

1.3. Applicability of SDP to IDMS

   RTCP XR [RFC3611] defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for
   the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR
   packets can be signaled by an application using the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].

   SDP signaling is used to set up and maintain a synchronization group
   between Synchronization Clients (SCs).

1.4. This document and ETSI TISPAN

   ETSI TISPAN [TS 183 063] has specified architecture and protocol for
   IDMS using RTCP XR exchange and optional SDP signaling. This internet
   draft is an excerpt of the IDMS part of that specification.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3. Overview of IDMS operation

   This section provides a brief example of how the IDMS RTCP XR block
   is used. The section is tutorial in nature and does not contain any
   normative statements.

   Alice is watching TV in her living room. At some point she sees that
   a football game of Bob's favorite team is on. She sends him an invite
   to watch the program together. Embedded in the invitation is the link
   to the media server and a unique sync-group identifier.

   Bob, who is also at home, receives the invite on his laptop. He
   accepts Alice's invitation and the RTP client on his laptop sets up a
   session to the media server. A VoIP connection to Alice's TV is also
   set up, so that Alice and Bob can talk while watching the program.

   As is common with RTP, both the RTP client in Alice's TV as well as
   the one in Bob's laptop send periodic RTCP Receiver Reports (RR) to
   the media server. However, in order to make sure Alice and Bob see
   the events in the football game at the same time, their clients also
   periodically send an IDMS XR block to the MSAS function of the media
   server. Included in the XR blocks are timestamps on when both Alice
   and Bob have received a particular RTP packet.

   The MSAS function in the media server calculates a reference client
   from the received IDMS XR blocks (e.g. by selecting whichever client
   received the packet the latest as the reference client). It then
   sends the IDMS XR block of this reference client to both Alice and
   Bob.

   In this case Bob has the slowest connection and the reference client
   therefore includes a delay similar to the one experienced by Bob.
   Upon reception of this information, Alice's RTP client can choose
   what to do with this information. In this case it decreases its play-
   out rate temporally until it matches with the reference client play-
   out(and thus matches Bob's play-out). Another option for Alice's TV
   would be to simply pause playback until it catches up. The exact
   implementation of the synchronization algorithm is up to the client.

   Upon reception of the reference client XR block, Bob's client does
   not have to do anything since it is already synchronized to the
   reference client (since it is based on Bob's delay). Note that other
   synchronization algorithms may introduce even more delay then the
   most delay client, e.g. to account for delay variations, for new
   clients joining an existing synchronization group, etc.

4. Inter-destination media synchronization use cases

   Social TV is the combination of media content consumption by two or
   more users at different devices and locations and real-time
   communication between those users.

   An example of Social TV, is when two or more users are watching the
   same television broadcast at different devices and locations, while
   communicating with each other using text, audio and/or video.

   A skew in the media play-out of the two or more users can have
   adverse effects on their experience. A well-known use case here is
   one friend experiencing a goal in a football match well before or
   after other friend(s).Thus IDMS is required to provide play-out
   synchronization.

   Another example of Social TV is Shared Service Control, where two or
   more users experience some content-on-demand together, while sharing
   the trick-play controls (play, pause, fast forward, rewind) of the
   content on demand.

   Similar to the previous use case, without IDMS, differences in play-
   out speed and the effect of transit delay of trick-play control
   signals would desynchronize content play-out.

5. Architecture for inter-destination media synchronization

   The architecture for IDMS, which is based around a sync-maestro
   architecture [Boronat2009], is sketched below. The Synchronization
   Client (SC) and Media Synchronization Application Server (MSAS)
   entities are shown as additional functionality for the RTP receiver
   and sender respectively.

Internet-Draft              RTCP for IDMS                  January 2011


   It should be noted that a master/slave type of architecture is also
   supported by having one of the SC devices also act as an MSAS. In
   this case the MSAS functionality is thus embedded in an RTP receiver
   instead of an RTP sender.

5.1. Media Synchronization Application Server (MSAS)

   An MSAS collects RTP packet arrival times and play-out times from one
   or more SC(s) in a synchronization group. The MSAS summarizes and
   distributes this information to the SCs in the synchronization group,
   e.g. by determining the SC with the most lagged play-out and using
   its reported RTP packet arrival time and play-out time as a summary.

5.2. Synchronization Client (SC)

   An SC reports RTP packet arrival times and play-out times of a media
   stream. It can receive summaries of such information, and use that to
   adjust its play-out buffer.

6. RTCP XR Block Type for IDMS

   This section specifies the RTCP XR Block Type for reporting inter-
   destination media synchronization information on an RTP media stream.
   Its definition is based on [RFC3611]. The RTCP XR is used to provide
   feedback information on receipt times and presentation times of RTP
   packets to e.g. a Sender [RFC3611], a Feedback Target [RFC5760] or a
   Third Party Monitor [RFC3611]. The block can also be used to indicate
   synchronization settings instructions to a receiver of the RTP media
   stream.

   The first 64 bits form the header of the RTCP XR, as defined in
   [RFC3611]. The SSRC of packet sender identifies the sender of the
   specific RTCP packet.

   The IDMS report block consists of 7 32-bit words, with the following
   fields:

   Block Type (BT): 8 bits. It identifies the block format. Its value
   SHALL be set to 12.

   Synchronization Packet Sender Type (SPST): 4 bits. This field
   indentifies the role of the packet sender for this specific eXtended
   Report. It can have the following values:

   SPST=0   Reserved For future use.

   SPST=1   The packet sender is an SC. It uses this XR to report
   synchronization status information. Timestamps relate to the SC
   input.

   SPST=2   The packet sender is an MSAS. It uses this XR to report
   synchronization settings instructions. Timestamps relate to the input
   of a virtual SC, which acts as reference to which the SCs belonging
   to this session are synchronized.

   Reserved bits (Resrv): 3 bits. These bits are reserved for future
   definition. In the absence of such a definition, the bits in this
   field MUST be set to zero and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   this flag is set to zero, then the Packet Presented NTP timestamp
   shall not be inspected.

   Block Length: 16 bits. This shall be set to 7, as this RTCP Block
   Type has a fixed length.

   Payload Type (PT):  7 bits. This field identifies the format of the
   media payload, according to [RFC3551]. The media payload is
   associated with an RTP timestamp clock rate. This clock rate provides
   the time base for the RTP timestamp counter.

   Reserved bits (Resrv): 25 bits. These bits are reserved for future
   use and shall be set to 0.

   Media Stream Correlation Identifier: 32 bits. This identifier is used
   to correlate synchronized media streams. The value 0 (all bits are
   set "0") indicates that this field is empty. The value 2^32-1 (all
   bits are set "1") is reserved for future use. If the RTCP Packet
   Sender is an SC or an MSAS (SPST=1 or SPST=2), then the Media Stream
   Correlation Identifier maps on the SyncGroupId.

   SSRC: 32 bits. The SSRC of the media source shall be set to the value
   of the SSRC identifier carried in the RTP header [RFC3550] of the RTP
   packet to which the XR relates.

   Packet Received NTP timestamp: 64 bits. This NTP timestamp [RFC5905]
   is the arrival wall clock time of the first octet of the RTP packet
   to which the XR relates. For SPST=2 it relates to a virtual SC to
   which the other SCs in the synchronization group may synchronize. SCs
   SHALL be globally time-synchronized (e.g. by using NTP, GPS or other
   solutions).

   Packet Received RTP timestamp: 32 bits. This timestamp has the value
   of the RTP time stamp carried in the RTP header [RFC3550] of the RTP
   packet to which the XR relates.

   Packet Presented NTP timestamp: 32 bits. This timestamp reflects the
   NTP time when the data contained in the first octet of the associated
   RTP packet is presented to the user. It consists of the least
   significant 16 bits of the NTP seconds part and the most significant

   16 bits of the NTP fractional second part.  If this field is empty,
   then it SHALL be set to 0 and the Packet Presented NTP timestamp flag
   (P) SHALL be set to 0.

7. SDP parameter for IDMS

   The SDP parameter sync-group is used to signal the use of the RTCP XR
   block for inter-destination media synchronization. It is also used to
   carry an identifier for the synchronization group to which clients
   belong or will belong. This SDP parameter extends rtcp-xr-attrib as
   follows, using Augmented Backus-Naur Form [RFC5234].

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF
   ; Original definition from [RFC3611], section 5.1

   xr-format =/ grp-sync ; Extending xr-format for inter-destination
   media synchronization

   grp-sync = "grp-sync" [",sync-group=" SyncGroupId]

   SyncGroupId = 1*DIGIT ; Numerical value from 0 till 4294967295

   DIGIT = %x30-39

   SyncGroupId is a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order and
   represented in decimal. SyncGroupId identifies a group of SCs for
   inter-destination media synchronization. It maps on the Media Stream
   Correlation Identifier of Annex W.1 [TS 183 063] for SPST=1 and
   SPST=2. The value SyncGroupId=0 represents an empty SyncGroupId. The
   value 4294967295 (2^32-1) is reserved for future use.

   The following is an example of the SDP attribute for inter-
   destination media synchronization.

   a=rtcp-xr:grp-sync,sync-group=42

8. Operational considerations

   On the use of NTP:

   To achieve inter-destination synchronization, the different receivers
   involved need synchronized clocks as a common timeline for
   synchronization. Depending on the synchronization accuracy required,
   different clock synchronization methods can be used. For social TV,
   synchronization accuracy should be achieved in order of hunderds of
   ms. In that case, correct use of NTP on receivers will in most
   situations achieve the required accuracy. As a guideline, to deal

Internet-Draft              RTCP for IDMS                  January 2011


   with clock drift of receivers, receivers should synchronize their
   clocks at the beginning of a synchronized session.

   Inter-destination synchronization may be used for other purposes,
   such as synchronization of multiple television outputs in a single
   physical location, or for the synchronization of different networked
   speakers throughout a house. Because of the stringent synchronization
   requirements for achieving good audio, a high accuracy will be
   needed. In this case, NTP usage may not be sufficient. Either a local
   NTP server could be setup, or some other more accurate clock
   synchronization mechanism could be used, such as using GPS time or
   the Precision Time Protocol [IEEE-1588].

   On Echo Cancellation:

   In the case of social TV, if the two locations have a "side channel"
   audio conference so the watchers can talk about what they are
   watching, this may cause an audio problem that will not be solved by
   just applying inter-destination media synchronization. The audio
   output of the television of one watcher will pass through the audio
   conference, and arrive at the second watcher out of sync with the
   television output of that second watcher. Different methods can be
   used to deal with this effect, e.g. using directional microphones to
   prevent this or applying echo cancellors to filter out the unwanted
   audio signals.

   On reception vs presentation timing:

   A receiver can report on different timing events, i.e. on packet
   arrival times and on play-out times. A receiver SHALL report on
   arrival times and a receiver MAY report on play-out times. RTP packet
   arrival times are relatively easy to report on. Normally, the
   processing and play-out of the same media stream by different
   receivers will take roughly the same amount of time. By synchronizing
   on packet arrival times, you may loose some accuracy, but it will be
   adequate for many applications, such as social TV. Also, if the
   receivers are in some way controlled, e.g. having the same buffer
   settings and decoding times, high accuracy can be achieved. But, if
   all receivers in a synchronization session have the ability to report
   on, and thus synchronize on, actual play-out times, this may be more
   accurate. It is up to applications and implementations of this RTCP
   extension whether to implement and use this.

   On control vs reporting:

   Note that the use of RTCP in this way, is still a form of reporting.
   This is e.g. comparable with inter-media synchronization (i.e. lip-
   sync) described in RFC 3550. The timestamp pairs in RTCP SR packets


Brandenburg             Expires July 13, 2011                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft              RTCP for IDMS                  January 2011


   on different but related RTP streams can be used by a receiver to
   achieve inter-media synchronization, by supplying a relation to a
   single reference clock. A receiver is not obliged to present multiple
   stream in synchronization, it is the application that is enabled to
   do so. Inter-destination media synchronization is similar in this
   respect: it does not mandate the synchronization, but it does enable
   applications to do so.

9. Security Considerations

   The specified RTCP XR Block Type in this document is used to collect,
   summarize and distribute information on packet-receptionion times and
   play-out times of streaming media. The information may be used to
   orchestrate the media play-out at multiple devices.

   Errors in the information, either accidental or malicious, may lead
   to undesired behavior. For example, if one device erroneously reports
   a two-hour delayed play-out, then another device in the same
   synchronization group could decide to delay its play-out by two hours
   as well, in order to keep its play-out synchronized. A user would
   likely interpret this two hour delay as a malfunctioning service.

   Therefore, the application logic of both Synchronization Clients and
   Media Synchronization Application Servers should check for
   inconsistent information. Differences in play-out time exceeding
   configured limits (e.g. more than ten seconds) could be an indication
   of such inconsistent information.

   No new mechanisms are introduced in this document to ensure
   confidentiality. Encryption procedures, such as those being suggested
   for a Secure RTP (SRTP) at the time that this document was written,
   can be used when confidentiality is a concern to end hosts.

10. IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration. For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

   [TS 183 063] assigns the block type value 12 in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry to "Inter-destination Media Synchronization Block". [TS
   183 063] also registers the SDP [RFC4566] parameter "grp-sync" for
   the "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry.

11. Conclusions

   This document gives information on the RTCP XR and the associated SDP
   parameter for inter-destination media synchronization.
