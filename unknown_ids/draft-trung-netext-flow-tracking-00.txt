                   Flow tracking procedure for PMIPv6
                  draft-trung-netext-flow-tracking-00

Abstract

   When a mobile node attaches to the proxy mobile IPv6 domain by using
   multiple interfaces simultaneously, it can dynamically move a flow
   from an interface to another.  A Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) should
   be aware of this event and inform a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) to
   send packets of the flow to appropriate interfaces.  This document
   introduces procedures for the MAGs and a LMA to actively track the
   movement of the flow basing on the flow-label of the IPv6 packet
   header.

Internet-Draft     Flow tracking procedure for PMIPv6         March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [1] can support multihoming.  The
   mobile node can send simultaneously packets to the PMIPv6 domain over
   multiple interfaces.  However it cannot support flow mobility.  When
   the flow is moved from an interface to another interface, there are
   two technical issues that PMIPv6 has to solve:

   o  The first one is how to maintain the session of the mobility flow
      when the source address of the flow is changed from an interface
      to another.  [3]

   o  The second one is how the LMA can route packets of a flow sent
      from correspondent node to the correct interfaces.

   Since the first issue can be solved by using virtual interface [4],
   in this document we tackle on the second issue.  We discuss about how
   to enable the MAG and the LMA to actively track the movement of
   flows.

   There are several internet drafts introduce solutions for controlling
   the movement of flows.  Some of them initiate the flow binding from
   the LMA such as in [5], while the others initiate the flow binding
   update from the MAG such as in [6].  Since the MAG is the direct
   attached point of the mobile node to the proxy mobile IPv6 domain, it
   can actively track the packets sent from the mobile node and then
   inform the movement of the source of packets to the LMA.


2.  The MAG operation

   When a mobile node attaches to the proxy mobile IPv6 by using
   simultaneously multiple interfaces, the router solicitation messages
   are sent to the MAGs via multiple interfaces.  Multiple bi-
   directional tunnels will be established between the MAGs and the LAM
   for serving the packets sent to and from the mobile node via the
   multiple interfaces.  The procedure of establishing bi-directional
   tunnel is discussed detail in the [1].

   After establishing bi-directional tunnels successfully, we enable the
   MAGs to actively start tracking the flows sending from the mobile
   node.  To do that, we modify the operation of the MAG and LMA, as
   well as extend the Binding Update List Entry (BULE) and the Binding
   Cache Entry (BCE) data structure.  The signaling between MAG and LMA
   is also added.

Internet-Draft     Flow tracking procedure for PMIPv6         March 2010


2.1.  Classifying flows by using flow-label

   A flow is a sequence of packets sent from a particular source to a
   particular destination.  It could consist of all packets in a
   specific transport connection or a media stream.  The MAG can
   classify the flow basing on the 5-tuple of the source and destination
   addresses, ports, and the transport protocol type.  However, some of
   these fields may be unavailable due to either fragmentation or
   encryption.  The usage of the 3-tuple of the Flow Label and the
   Source and Destination Address fields enables efficient IPv6 flow
   classification, where only IPv6 main header fields in fixed positions
   are used as discussed in [2].

   Since the flow label identifies all packets belonging to a specific
   flow, the MAG can identify these packets and handle them in a similar
   fashion.  The flow label information will be stored in the extended
   field of the binding update list entry.  Which will be discussed more
   detail in the next section.

2.2.  Extension of the Binding Update List Entry (BULE) Data Structure

   For supporting the flow-label tracking, each BULE should be extended
   with a 20-bit flow-label field.  This field is used for storing the
   flow-label of the flow that the mobile node sends to the MAG.

   After extending the BULE data structure, each node is represented by
   multiple sub-BULEs.  Each sub-BULE corresponds to a specific flow-
   label.

2.3.  Flow tracking procedure

   Whenever receiving a packet, the MAG extracts the flow-label from
   IPv6 packet's header [2] and compare it with the flow-label field of
   all of the sub-BULEs that represents for the mobile node.  If is a
   new label, the MAG will understands that there is a new flow sent
   from the mobile node.  Then it will send a signaling message to the
   LMA to inform that there is a new flow sent from the mobile node via
   this MAG.


3.  The LMA operation

3.1.  Extension of the Binding Cache Entry Data (BCE) Structure

   For supporting the flow-label tracking, each BCE should be extended
   with a 20-bit flow-label field.  This filed is used for storing the
   flow-label of the flow that sent to or from the specific MAG.

Internet-Draft     Flow tracking procedure for PMIPv6         March 2010


   After extending the BCE data structure, each mobility session now is
   represented by multiple sub-BCEs.  Each sub-BCEs corresponds to a
   specific flow-label.

3.2.  Flow tracking procedure

   Whenever the LMA receives a singling message from MAGs informing
   about the new flow sent to the MAG, the LMA compare the flow-label of
   this flow with the flow-label fields of all of the sub-BCEs that
   represent for the node to decide whether to update the existing sub-
   BCE or add new sub-BCE for this flow.

   o  If there is a sub-BCE entry that has the same flow-label field
      value and different ATT or Proxy-CoA, the LMA will understand that
      this is a mobility flow and update the sub-BCE for this flow.

   o  If there are no sub-BCE entries that have the same flow-label
      field value, the LMA will understand that it is a new flow and add
      a new sub-BCE entry for it.


4.  An example

   The figure 1 shows the flow tracking procedure of an example, in
   which the mobile node attaches to the proxy mobile IPv6 by using two
   interfaces, IF 1 and IF 2.  There are two bi-directional tunnels are
   established using the basic procedure of the [1].We assume that the
   flow 1 is initiated from the interface IF1 and sent to the MAG1.
   When the MAG1 receives the first packet of the flow 1, it will
   extract the flow-label and add a new sub-BULE for tracking the flow 1
   and binding it to the bi-directional tunnel 1 which is established
   between the MAG1 and the LMA.  The MAG1 then send a signaling message
   to the LMA to inform that there is a new flow sent from the mobile
   node to the MAG1 via the interface IF1.  The LMA then add a new sub-
   BCE for tracking the flow 1.

                     Figure 1: Flow tracking procedure

   In the figure 2, we assume that the flow 1 is moved from IF1 to the
   interface IF2.  From the point of view of the MAG2, the flow 1 is a
   new flow so a new sub-BULE is added and a signaling message is sent
   from MAG2 to LMA to inform that the flow 1 is now sent to LMA via
   MAG2.  Since there an existing sub-BCE of flow 1 with different ATT
   and different Proxy-CoA, the LMA understands that flow 1 is moved
   from the MAG1 to the MAG2 then the LMA will update new ATT and Proxy-
   CoA to the record of the flow 1 sub-BCE.  After updated successfully,
   the new routing path for the flow 1 via MAG2 is established.  The
   packets of the flows 1 are now can be exchanged via the MAG2.

5.  Conclusion

   In this document we briefly introduce the procedures for the MAG and
   the LMA to actively track the movement of flows.  They do not require
   any involvements of the mobile node.  In the next version of the
   document, we will discuss more detail about the structure of flow
   binding messages as well as the extended structure of the binding
   ache entry at the LMA and the detail procedures.
