                      MSIG for Lightweight DNSSEC
                      draft-yao-dnsext-msig-00.txt

Abstract

   DNSSEC is trying to be deployed everywhere.  Many are afraid of
   DNSSEC deployment, which are too heavy to be deployed.  There is a
   huge gap between the resources we need to deploy DNSSEC and the
   benefits or security we can get from the DNSSEC.  This document
   proposes a lightweight DNSSEC mechanism to make the DNSSEC to be
   deployed easily while getting the similar security with the heavy
   DNSSEC.

1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) [RFC4033] [RFC4034]
   [RFC4035] has secured the communication between the root server and
   the recursive resolver.  [RFC4035] provides public key transaction
   signatures to support this, but it needs to sign every resource
   record.  So for every resource record queried, a public key verifying
   procedure is necessary.  DNSSEC needs not only DS and DNSKEY resource
   record but also, NSEC or NSEC3 and RRSIG to deploy DNSSEC.  The size
   of the DNSSEC signed zone can be easily be expanded to 3 or 5 times
   of the original zone without enabled DNSSEC.  DNSCurv proposal has
   gotten some controversial discussion because it totally changed the
   DNS packet and may change the DNS to the new stuff.  TSIG is
   lightweight, and provides both authentication and integrity checking,
   but TSIG requires configuration of a shared secret, so it suffers
   from a serious key distribution problem and can not be used for
   server-server communications.  This document specifies the new
   mechanism which provides the message signature (MSIG) between severs
   and servers or between servers and resolvers.

1.1.  Terminology

   All the basic terms used in this specification are defined in the
   documents [RFC1034], and [RFC1035].


2.  MSIG mechanism

   This mechanism will use the public key technology to make sure that
   the dns query or response packet is authenticated and integrated.
   There are RRSIG and NSEC (NSEC3) for every resource record [RFC1034]
   and [RFC1035] in the current DNSSEC technology [RFC4033] [RFC4034]
   and [RFC4035].  This document specifies that only DNSKEY and DS
   resource records can have the RRSIGs.  Other resource records such as
   MX, A resource record will not need the RRSIG resource record.  This
   make the zone to expand only a little.  This document defines a new
   resource record called MSIG, which store the DNS message signature.
   The outgoing DNS message from one zone will use the zone's DNSKEY to
   produce a keyed-hash signature similar to producing of RRSIG.  This
   signature will be the part of RDATA of the MSIG resource record.  The
   price of the DNSSEC deployment will be decreased as much as possible.
   The recipient of the MSIG can use the public key to verify the
   signature to prove whether the DNS message is received from the
   proper sender and does not be tampered.  Both the DNS query and
   response can produce and bring the DNS signature in the MSIG resource
   record.

3.  MSIG RR Format

3.1.  MSIG RR type

   To provide secret key authentication, we use a new RR type whose
   mnemonic is MSIG and whose type code is X. MSIG is a meta-RR and MUST
   not be cached.  MSIG RRs are used for authentication between DNS
   entities.  MSIG RRs are dynamically computed to cover a particular
   DNS transaction and are not DNS RRs in the usual sense.

3.2.  MSIG Calculation

   As the MSIG RRs are related to one DNS request/response, there is no
   value in storing or retransmitting them, thus the MSIG RR is
   discarded once it has been used to authenticate a DNS message.  The
   signing algorithm specified in this document is same as the
   specification in DNSSEC [RFC4033] [RFC4034] and [RFC4035].  Other
   algorithms can be specified at a later date.  This document will
   follow the names and definitions of new algorithms registered with
   IANA for DNSSEC.  All multi-octet integers in the MSIG record are
   sent in network byte order (see [RFC1035 2.3.2]).

3.3.  Record Format


     <owner> <ttl> <class> MSIG <rdata>

   The owner name will be in the form of msig_.example.com while the
   example.com is the name of the apex of the zone if the msig is from
   the DNS servers, the "resolver.resolver" or the resolver's domain
   name if the msig is from the resolver.  The TTL is zero, the class
   can be any, and the RDATA has the following wire format

3.3.1.  The Key Tag Field

   The Key Tag field contains the key tag value of the DNSKEY RR that
   validates this signature, in network byte order.  Appendix B explains
   how to calculate Key Tag values of [RFC4034].

3.3.2.  The Algorithm Number Field

   The Algorithm Number field identifies the cryptographic algorithm
   used to create the signature.  A list of DNSSEC algorithm types can
   be found in Appendix A.1 of [RFC4034].

3.3.3.  The reserved Field

   This field is for future use.

3.3.4.  Signature Expiration and Inception Fields

   The Signature Expiration and Inception fields specify a validity
   period for the signature.  The RRSIG record MUST NOT be used for
   authentication prior to the inception date and MUST NOT be used for
   authentication after the expiration date.  The Signature Expiration
   and Inception field values specify a date and time in the form of a
   32-bit unsigned number of seconds elapsed since 1 January 1970
   00:00:00 UTC, ignoring leap seconds, in network byte order.

3.3.5.  The Signer's Name Field

   The Signer's Name field value identifies the owner name of the DNSKEY
   RR that a validator is supposed to use to validate this signature.
   The Signer's Name field MUST contain the name of the zone or the
   domain name of the resolvers.  A sender MUST NOT use DNS name
   compression on the Signer's Name field when transmitting a MSIG RR.

3.3.6.  The Signature Field

   The Signature field contains the cryptographic signature that covers
   the original DNS message(excluding the MSIG resource record).  The
   format of this field depends on the algorithm in use, and these
   formats are described in separate companion documents.


4.  MSIG Operation

4.1.  Effects of adding MSIG to outgoing message

   Once the outgoing message has been constructed, the signing operation
   can be performed.  The resulting message signature will then be
   stored in a MSIG which is appended to the additional data section
   (the ARCOUNT is incremented to reflect this).  If the MSIG record
   cannot be added without causing the message to be truncated, the
   server MUST alter the response so that a MSIG can be included.  This
   response consists of only the question and a MSIG record, and has the
   TC bit set and RCODE 0 (NOERROR).  The client SHOULD at this point
   retry the request using TCP (per [RFC1035 4.2.2]).

4.2.  MSIG processing on incoming messages

   If an incoming message contains a MSIG record, it MUST be the last
   record in the additional section.  Multiple MSIG records are not
   allowed.  If a MSIG record is present in any other position, the
   packet is dropped and a response with RCODE 1 (FORMERR) MUST be
   returned.  Upon receipt of a message with a correctly placed MSIG RR,
   the MSIG RR is copied to a safe location, removed from the DNS
   Message, and decremented out of the DNS message header's ARCOUNT.  At
   this point the signing operation is performed.  If the signature do
   not match, the whole DNS message MUST be discarded.

   To use DNSSEC RRs and MSIG for authentication, a security-aware
   resolver requires configured knowledge of at least one authenticated
   DNSKEY or DS RR.  The process for obtaining and authenticating this
   initial trust anchor could use some out of band mechanism such as the
   off-line authenticated exchange to obtain a zone's DNSKEY RR or to
   obtain a DS RR that identifies and authenticates a zone's DNSKEY RR.

Internet-Draft                    msig                       August 2010


   An initial DNSKEY RR can be used to authenticate a zone's apex DNSKEY
   RRset.  Through proceeding recursively down the DNS tree, the
   resolver can verify the whole tree from the apex of the zone with the
   initial DNSKEY RR.  If the resolver were configured with a root
   DNSKEY RR, and if every delegation had a DS RR associated with it,
   then the resolver could obtain and validate any apex DNSKEY RRset.

4.3.  MSIG Variables and Coverage

   A whole and complete DNS message in wire format, before the MSIG RR
   has been added to the additional data section and before the DNS
   Message Header's ARCOUNT field has been incremented to contain the
   MSIG RR.  If the message ID differs from the original message ID, the
   original message ID is substituted for the message ID.  This could
   happen when forwarding a dynamic update request, for example.

4.4.  MSIG generation on requests

   The resolvers need to send some message to the DNS servers to
   indicate that the DNS message response with the TSIG is needed.
   [[there will have more discussion about the bits which might be used
   to indicate it.]]

4.5.  MSIG on Answers

   When a server has generated a response with a MSIG, it signs the
   response using the key of zone.  The server MUST not generate a
   signed response to the resolver which does not indicate the MSIG.

4.6.  Resolver processing of answer

   When a resolver receives a response from a server and expects to see
   a MSIG, it first checks if the MSIG RR is present in the response.
   Otherwise, the response is treated as having a format error and
   discarded.  The resolver then extracts the MSIG, adjusts the ARCOUNT,
   and calculates the keyed digest in the same way as the server.  If
   the MSIG does not validate, that response MUST be discarded, unless
   the RCODE is 9 (NOTAUTH).  A message containing an MSIG record which
   fails verification SHOULD not be considered as an acceptable
   response; the client SHOULD log an error and continue to wait for a
   signed response until the request times out.


5.  MSIG mechanism and full DNSSEC mechanism

   The MSIG mechanism uses the MSIG, DS, DNSKEY and RRSIG of DNSKEY (DS)
   to solve the problem of Data Origin Authentication and Data Integrity
   and only a few more RRs are needed to achive this goal to avoid the

   possible huge zone inflation.  EDNS0 [RFC2671] support is a "MUST"
   option for fully DNSSEC operations while the DNS message including
   the MSIG may be small and may not need to use the EDNS0 support.
   Although the MSIG mechanism does not directly prove the Non-Existence
   of some domain names, the verification of the DNS message with the
   MSIG also proves the Non-Existence of some domain names.  In
   conclusion, the MSIG mechanism and the full DNSSEC mechanism gets the
   similar achievements while the cost of implementation and deployment
   of the MSIG mechanism is smaller than the fully DNSSEC mechanism.


6.  MSIG and SIG(0)

   The MSIG's definition is similar to SIG(0) [RFC2931].  SIG(0) is
   designed for [RFC2535].  We may consider to use SIG(0) for the
   ligitweight DNSSEC after updating the SIG(0) the defintion of MSIG.

9.  Acknowledgements

   Many ideas are from the discussion in the DNSOP and DNSEXT mailing
   list.  Thanks a lot to all in the list.  Many important comments and
   suggestions are contributed by many members of the DNSEXT and DNSOP
   WGs.
