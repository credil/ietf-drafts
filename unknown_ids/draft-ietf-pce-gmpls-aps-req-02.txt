1. Introduction 

   The initial effort of PCE WG is focused on solving the path 
   computation problem over different domains in MPLS networks. As the 
   same case with MPLS, service providers (SPs) have also come up with 
   requirements for path computation in GMPLS networks such as photonics, 
   TDM-based or Ethernet-based networks as well. 

   [PCE-ARCH] and [PCECP-REQ] discuss the framework and requirements for 
   PCE on both packet MPLS networks and (non-packet switch capable) 
   GMPLS networks. This document complements these documents by 
   providing some consideration of GMPLS applications in the intra-
   domain and inter-domain networking environments and indicating a set 
   of requirements for the extended definition of series of PCE related 
   protocols. 

   Constraint based shortest path first (CSPF) computation within a 
   domain or over domains for signaling GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) 
   is more stringent than that of MPLS LSPs [MPLS-AS], because the 
   additional constraints, e.g., interface switching capability, link 
   encoding, link protection capability and so forth need to be 
   considered to establish GMPLS LSPs [CSPF]. GMPLS signaling protocol 
   [RFC3471, RFC3473] is designed taking into account bi-directionality, 
   switching type, encoding type, SRLG, and protection attributes of the

   TE links spanned by the path, as well as LSP encoding and switching 
   type for the end points, appropriately. 

   This document provides the investigated results of GMPLS applications 
   of PCE for the support of GMPLS path computation. This document also 
   provides requirements for GMPLS applications of PCE in the GMPLS 
   intra-domain and inter-domain environments.

3. GMPLS applications of PCE 

3.1. GMPLS network model 

   Figure 1 depicts a typical network, consisting of several GMPLS 
   domains, assumed in this document. D1, D2, D3 and D4 have multiple 
   GMPLS inter-domain connections, and D5 has only one GMPLS inter-
   domain connection. These domains follow the definition in [RFC4726].

   Each domain is configured using various switching and link 
   technologies defined in [Arch] and an end-to-end route needs to 
   respect TE link attributes like switching capability, encoding type, 
   etc., making the problem a bit different from the case of classical 
   (packet) MPLS. In order to route from one GMPLS domain to another 
   GMPLS domain appropriately, each domain manages traffic engineering 
   database (TED) by PCE, and exchanges or provides route information of 
   paths, while concealing its internal topology information. 

    
3.2. Path computation in GMPLS network 

   [CSPF] describes consideration of GMPLS TE attributes during path 
   computation.

               Figure 2: Path computation in GMPLS networks. 
 
   For the simplicity in consideration, the below basic assumptions are 
   made when the LSP is created. 

  (1) Switching capabilities of outgoing links from the ingress and 
      egress nodes (link1-2 and link4-3 in Figure 2) must be consistent with 
      each other. 
  (2) Switching capabilities of all transit links including incoming 
      links to the ingress and egress nodes (link2-1 and link3-4) should be 
      consistent with switching type of a LSP to be created. 
  (3) Encoding-types of all transit links should be consistent with 
      encoding type of a LSP to be created. 
    
   [CSPF] indicates the possible table of switching capability, encoding 
   type and bandwidth at the ingress link, transiting links and the 
   egress link which need to be satisfied with the created LSP. 

   The non-packet GMPLS networks (e.g., TDM networks) are usually 
   responsible for transmitting data for the client layer. These GMPLS 
   networks can provide different types of connections for customer 
   services based on different service bandwidth requests.  

   The applications and the corresponding additional requirements for 
   applying PCE in non-packet networks, for example, GMPLS-based TDM 
   networks, are described in Figure 3. In order to simplify the 
   description, this document just discusses the scenario in SDH 
   networks as an example. The scenarios in SONET or G.709 ODUk layer 
   networks are similar.

   Figure 3 shows a simple network topology, where N1, N2, N3, N4, and 
   N5 are all SDH switches. Assume that one Ethernet service with 100M 
   bandwidth is required from A1 to A2 over this network. The client 
   Ethernet service could be provided by a VC4 connection from N1 to N4, 
   and it could also be provided by three concatenated VC3 connections 
   (Contiguous or Virtual concatenation) from N1 to N4.  

   The type of connection(s) (one VC4 or three concatenated VC3) that is 
   required needs to be specified by PCC (e.g., N1 or NMS), but could 
   also be determined by PCE automatically based on policy [RFC5394]. 

   Therefore, the signal type, the type of the concatenation and the 
   number of the concatenation should also be considered during path 
   computation for PCE. 

3.3. Unnumbered Interface 

   GMPLS support unnumbered interface ID that is defined in [RFC 3477], 
   which means that the endpoints of the path may be unnumbered. It 
   should also be possible to request a Path between a numbered link and 
   an unnumbered link, or a P2MP path between different types of 
   endpoints. Therefore, the PCC should be capable of indicating the 
   unnumbered interface ID of the endpoints in the PCReq message.

3.4. Asymmetric Bandwidth Path Computation  

   As per [RFC 5467], GMPLS signaling can be used for setting up an 
   asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP. If a PCE is responsible for 
   the path computation, the PCE should be capable of computing a path 
   for the bidirectional LSP with asymmetric bandwidth. It means that 
   the PCC should be able to indicate the asymmetric bandwidth 
   requirements in forward and reverse directions in the PCReq message.  

4. Requirement for GMPLS application of PCE 

   In this section, we describe requirements for GMPLS applications of 
   PCE in order to establish GMPLS LSP. 

4.1. PCE requirements 

   As for path computation in GMPLS networks as discussed in section 3, 
   the PCE needs to consider the GMPLS TE attributes appropriately 
   according to tables in [CSPF] once a PCC or another PCE requests a 
   path computation. Indeed, the path calculation request message from 
   the PCC or the PCE needs to contain the information specifying 
   appropriate attributes. Additional attributes to those already 
   defined in [PCECP] are as follows. 

  (1) Switching capability: PSC1-4, L2SC, DCSC [DCSC-Ext], 802_1 PBB-TE 
      [GMPLS-PBB-TE], TDM, LSC, FSC 
 
  (2) Encoding type: as defined in [RFC4202], [RFC4203], e.g., Ethernet, 
      SONET/SDH, Lambda, etc. 
 
  (3) Signal Type: Indicates the type of elementary signal that        
      constitutes the requested LSP. A lot of signal types with        
      different granularity have been defined in SONET/SDH and G.709 ODUk, 
      such as VC11, VC12, VC2, VC3 and VC4 in SDH, and ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 in 
      G.709 ODUk. See [RFC4606] and [RFC4328]. 
 
  (4) Concatenation Type: In SDH/SONET and G.709 ODUk networks, two kinds 
      of concatenation modes are defined: contiguous     concatenation which 
      requires co-route for each member signal and requires all the 
      interfaces along the path to support this capability, and virtual 
      concatenation which allows diverse routes for the member signals and 
      only requires the ingress and egress interfaces to support this 
      capability. Note that for the virtual concatenation, it also may 
      specify co-routed or separated-routed. See [RFC4606] and [RFC4328] 
      about Concatenation information. 
 
  (5) Concatenation Number: Indicates the number of signals that are 
      requested to be contiguously or virtually concatenated. Also see 
      [RFC4606] and [RFC4328].

  (6) Wavelength Label: as defined in [Lambda-label]. 
 
  (7) e2e Path protection type: as defined in [RFC4872], e.g., 1+1 
      protection, 1:1 protection, (pre-planned) rerouting, etc. 
 
  (8) Administrative group: as defined in [RFC3630]. 
 
  (9) Link Protection type: as defined in [RFC4203]. 
 
  (10)Support for unnumbered interfaces: as defined in [RFC3477]. 
 
  (11)Support for asymmetric bandwidth request: as defined in [RFC 5467]. 
    
4.2. PCC requirements 

   As described above, a PCC needs to support to initiate path 
   computation request specifying abovementioned attributes. Afterwards, 
   GMPLS signaling will be invoked according to the responded messages 
   from the PCE. 

4.3. GMPLS PCE Management 

   PCE related Management Information Bases need to consider extensions 
   to be satisfied with requirements for GMPLS applications. For 
   extensions, [GMPLS-TEMIB] are defined to manage TE database and may 
   be referred to accommodate GMPLS TE attributes in the PCE. 

5. Security consideration 

   PCE extensions to support GMPLS should be considered under the same 
   security as current work. This extension will not change the 
   underlying security issues. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document has no actions for IANA.

Intellectual Property 
 
   The IETF Trust takes no position regarding the validity or scope of   
   any Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be   
   claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology   
   described in any IETF Document or the extent to which any license   
   under such rights might or might not be available; nor does it   
   represent that it has made any independent effort to identify any   
   such rights. 

   Copies of Intellectual Property disclosures made to the IETF   
   Secretariat and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or   
   the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or   
   permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or   
   users of this specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR   
   repository at http://www.ietf.org/ipr 

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any   
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary   
   rights that may cover technology that may be required to implement   
   any standard or specification contained in an IETF Document. Please   
   address the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org. 

   The definitive version of an IETF Document is that published by, or   
   under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of IETF Documents that are   
   published by third parties, including those that are translated into   
   other languages, should not be considered to be definitive versions   
   of IETF Documents. The definitive version of these Legal Provisions   
   is that published by, or under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of   
   these Legal Provisions that are published by third parties, including   
   those that are translated into other languages, should not be   
   considered to be definitive versions of these Legal Provisions. 

   For the avoidance of doubt, each Contributor to the IETF Standards   
   Process licenses each Contribution that he or she makes as part of   
   the IETF Standards Process to the IETF Trust pursuant to the   
   provisions of RFC 5378. No language to the contrary, or terms,   
   conditions or rights that differ from or are inconsistent with the   
   rights and licenses granted under RFC 5378, shall have any effect and   
   shall be null and void, whether published or posted by such   
   Contributor, or included with or in such Contribution.
