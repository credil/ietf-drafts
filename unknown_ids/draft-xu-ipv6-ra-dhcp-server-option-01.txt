Internet-Draft  IPv6 RA Option for Stateless DHCP Server    August 2010 
 
Abstract 

   This document proposes a new Router Advertisement option which 
   allows IPv6 hosts to obtain the addresses of stateless DHCP servers. 
   Thus, IPv6 hosts can directly contact stateless DHCP servers using 
   unicast.

Internet-Draft  IPv6 RA Option for Stateless DHCP Server    August 2010 
 
    
1. Terminology 

   This document uses the terminology defined in Stateless Address 
   Autoconfiguration [RFC2462], DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315] and 
   Stateless DHCPv6 [RFC3736]. 

2. Motivations 

   After obtaining IPv6 addresses through some other mechanisms such as 
   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC2462] or manual 
   configuration, IPv6 hosts can attempt to use stateless DHCP [RFC3736] 
   to obtain other configuration information (e.g., DNS recursive name 
   servers). According to [RFC3736], the DHCP client needs to first 
   sends an Information-Request message to the 
   All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address. DHCP servers 
   receiving the Information-Request message then respond with a Reply 
   message containing the desired configuration information. If the 
   DHCP client and DHCP servers are not located in the same broadcast 
   domain, the traffic between the client and the DHCP servers need to 
   be relayed by DHCP Relay Agents.  

   If the client can obtain the address of a stateless DHCP server from 
   someplace in advance, it can directly send Information-Request 
   messages to the DHCP server. With this approach, the latencies 
   imposed by relay agents can be eliminated and the clients do not 
   have to receive redundant responses from multiple DHCP servers. This 
   will also eliminate any potential impacts brought by multicast 
   traffic on the network performance. Additionally, unicast messages 
   are more difficult to intercept than multicast messages. Therefore, 
   if a client uses unicast to contact DHCP servers, the security 
   issues caused by rogue DHCP server can be mitigated to some extent. 
   Moreover, Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) is proposed to 
   be used by DHCP servers to avoid the Man in the Middle (MiTM) 
   attacks. A precondition of using CGA to avoid DHCP server spoofing 
   is DHCP clients already know their intended DHCP servers in advance. 
   Otherwise, a rogue DHCP server could easily generate a legitimate 
   CGA by using its own public key. Of course, this benefit is based on 
   the presumption that the rogue IPv6 Router Advertisement problem [I-
   D.draft-ietf-v6ops-rogue-ra-00] has been solved. 

   The document introduces a new Router Advertisement option called the 
   Stateless DHCP Server option which contains the IP addresses of 
   stateless DHCP servers. After obtaining the address of a stateless 
   DHCP server from this RA option, a client can use unicast to 
   directly communicate with the server. From the operational 
   perspective, this approach is analogous to the DNS usage that a DNS

   client obtains the address of a DNS server and uses unicast to 
   perform DNS resolution. 

3. RA Option for Stateless DHCP Server 

   A Stateless DHCP Server option contains at least one stateless DHCP 
   server address.  If there are multiple addresses, all of them share 
   a same lifetime value.  If different lifetime values are desired, 
   the IP addresses can be encapsulated within different options.  
   Figure 1 shows the format of the Stateless DHCP Server option.

   Fields: 

        Type          8-bit identifier of the Stateless DHCP Server 
                      option type to be assigned by the IANA; 

        Length        8-bit unsigned integer. The length of the option          
                      (including the Type and Length fields) is in 
                      units of 8 octets.  The minimum value is 3 if one 
                      IPv6 address is contained in the option.  Every 
                      additional DHCP Server address increases the 
                      length by 2.  The Length field is used by the 
                      receiver to determine the number of                   
                      IPv6 addresses in the option. 

        Lifetime      32-bit unsigned integer. The maximum time, in

                      over which this DHCP Server address MAY be used 
                      for obtaining configuration information.  Hosts 
                      MAY send a Router Solicitation to ensure the DHCP 
                      Sever information is fresh before the                   
                      interval expires.

        Addresses of Stateless DHCP Servers 

                      One or more 128-bit IPv6 addresses of the 
                      stateless DHCP servers.  The number of the 
                      addresses can be derived from the value of the 
                      Length field. Specifically, the number of 
                      addresses is equal to (Length - 1) / 2. 

4. DHCPv6 Extensions 

   After obtaining the address of a DHCP server from the Stateless DHCP 
   Server option, a client could send an information-Request message 
   directly to the DHCP server via unicast. 

   In [RFC3315], we found the following statement: "A server MUST 
   discard any Solicit, Confirm, Rebind or Information-request messages 
   it receives with a unicast destination address." We believe that the 
   designers of DHCPv6 assumed that clients have no knowledge about the 
   IP addresses of DHCP servers at the time they send Information-
   request messages. Therefore, if a DHCP server receives an 
   Information-request message with a unicast destination address, it 
   will regard it as an abnormal message. However, in the scenarios 
   where clients can get the IP addresses of DHCP servers from 
   someplace else, this assumption is invalid anymore. Therefore, we 
   argue that a stateless DHCP server SHOULD accept an Information-
   request messages it receives with a unicast destination address.  

5. Security Considerations 

   In practice, DHCP relay agents can be used to slower or damp the 
   frequency of attacks on the DHCP servers. With the approach 
   mentioned above, attackers can bypass DHCP relay agents and send 
   flooding traffic directly to DHCPv6 servers. However, since the 
   stateless DHCP server doesn't need to maintain dynamic states for 
   individual clients, such flooding attack on DHCP Servers will not be 
   worse than the attack on DNS servers. 

   In some special scenarios where DHCP clients are required to access 
   DHCP servers through DHCP relay agents, the proposed RA option can 
   convey the IP addresses of DHCP relay agents rather than the 
   addresses of DHCP servers. 

6.  IANA Considerations 

   The IANA SHOULD assign an IPV6 Neighbor Discovery option for the 
   Option defined in this document in the "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery 
   Option Formats" registry.
