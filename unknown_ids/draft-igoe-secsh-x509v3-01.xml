        <abstract><t>X.509 public key certificates use a signature by a trusted certification authority to bind a given public key to a given digital identity.  This document outlines how to incorporate X.509 version 3 public key certificates into the authentication methods of the Secure Shell protocol.</t></abstract>

    </front>

    <middle>

		<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

			<t>There are two Secure Shell (SSH) protocols that use public key cryptography for authentication.  The Transport Layer Protocol, described in <xref target="RFC4253"/>, requires that a digital signature algorithm (called the "public key algorithm") MUST be used to authenticate the server to the client.  Additionally, the User Authentication Protocol described in <xref target="RFC4252"/> allows for the use of a digital signature to authenticate the client to the server ("publickey" authentication).</t>

			<t>In both cases, the validity of the authentication depends upon the strength of the linkage between the public signing key and the identity of the signer.  Digital certificates, such as those in X.509 version 3 (X.509v3) format, use a chain of signatures by a trusted root certification authority and its designated intermediate certificate authorites to bind a given public signing key to a given digital identity.</t> 

			<t>The following public key authentication algorithms are presently available for use in SSH:</t>

			<texttable>
				<ttcol align="center">Algorithm</ttcol>
				<ttcol align="center">Reference</ttcol>
				<c>ssh-dss</c> <c><xref target="RFC4253" /></c>
				<c>ssh-rsa</c> <c><xref target="RFC4253" /></c>
				<c>pgp-sign-dss</c> <c><xref target="RFC4253" /></c>
				<c>pgp-sign-rsa</c> <c><xref target="RFC4253" /></c>
				<c>ecdsa-sha2-*</c> <c><xref target="RFC5656" /></c>
			</texttable>

			<t>Since PGP has its own method for binding a public key to a digital identity, this document focuses solely upon the non-PGP methods.  In particular, this document defines the following public key algorithms which differ from the above solely in their use of X.509v3 certificates to convey the signer's public key.</t>

			<texttable>
				<ttcol align="center">Algorithm</ttcol>
				<c>x509v3-ssh-dss</c>
				<c>x509v3-ssh-rsa</c>
				<c>x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-*</c>
			</texttable>

			<t>Public keys conveyed using the x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-* public key algorithm can be used with the ecmqv-sha2 key exchange method.</t>

			<t>Implementation of this specification requires familiarity with the Secure Shell protocol <xref target="RFC4251" /> <xref target="RFC4253" /> and X.509v3 certificates <xref target="RFC5280" />.</t>
			
			<t>This document is concerned with SSH implementation details; specification of the underlying cryptographic algorithms and the handling and structure of X.509v3 certificates is left to other standards documents.</t>

			<t>An earlier Internet-Draft for the use of X.509v3 certificates in the Secure Shell was proposed by O. Saarenmaa and J. Galbraith; while this document is informed in part by that Internet-Draft, it does not maintain strict compatibility.</t>
			
		</section>

		<section anchor="x509v3" title="X.509 Version 3 Certificates">

			<t>The reader is referred to <xref target="RFC5280" /> for a general description of X.509 version 3 certificates.  For the purposes of this document, it suffices to know that in X.509 a chain or sequence of certificates (possibly of length one) allows a Root Certificate Authority and its designated Intermediate Certificate Authorities to cryptographically bind a given public key to a given digital identity using public key signatures.</t>

			<t>For all of the public key algorithms specified in this document, the key format consists of a sequence of one or more X.509v3 certificates followed by a sequence of 0 or more Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses as in Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC2560" />.   Providing OCSP responses directly in this data structure can reduce the number of communication rounds required (saving the implementation from needing to perform OCSP checking out-of-band) and can also allow a client outside of a private network to receive OCSP responses from a server behind firewall.  As with any use of OCSP data, implementations SHOULD check that the production time of the OCSP response is acceptable.  It is RECOMMENDED, but not REQUIRED, that implementations reject certificates for which the certificate status is revoked.</t>

			<t>The key format has the following specific encoding:</t>

			<figure>
			<artwork>
     string    "x509v3-ssh-dss" / "x509v3-ssh-rsa" / "x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-*"
     uint32    certificate-count
     string    certificate[1..certificate-count]
     uint32    ocsp-response-count
     string    ocsp-response[0..ocsp-response-count]</artwork>
	 		</figure>
			
			<t>Each certificate and ocsp-response MUST be encoded as a string of octets using the DER encoding of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) <xref target="ASN1" />.  An example of an SSH key exchange involving one of these public key algorithms is given in <xref target="example" />.</t>

			<t>Additionally, the following constraints apply:</t>
 
			<t>
			<list style="symbols">
			<t>The sender's certificate MUST be the first certificate and the public key conveyed by this certificate MUST be consistent with the public key algorithm being employed to authenticate the sender.</t>
			<t>Each following certificate MUST certify the one preceding it.</t>
			<t>The self-signed certificate specifying the root authority MAY be omitted.</t>
			<t>The individual certificates in the certificate chain MUST be signed using only algorithms corresponding to public key algorithms supported by the peer.  The choice of signature algorithm used by any given certificate is independent of the signature algorithms chosen by other certificates in the chain.  However, verifiers SHOULD be prepared to receive certificate chains that do not comply with this (in other words, using any signature algorithms), and MAY verify a non-compliant chain if they are able to do so.</t>
			</list>
			</t>
 
			<t>Issues associated with the use of certificates (such as expiration of certificates and revocation of compromised certificates) are addressed in <xref target="RFC5280" /> and are outside the scope of this document.  However, compliant implementations MUST comply with <xref target="RFC5280" />.  Implementations providing and processing OCSP responses MUST comply with <xref target="RFC2560" />.</t>
 
			<t><xref target="I-D.solinas-suiteb-cert-profile" /> gives specific guidance on the structure of X.509v3 certificates to be used with Suite B ECDSA public keys.  <xref target="RFC5280" /> provides guidance on certificates for RSA and DSA.</t>

			<section anchor="x509v3-ext" title="Certificate Extensions">

				<section anchor="x509v3-ext-ku" title="KeyUsage">

					<t>The KeyUsage extension MAY be used to restrict a certificate's use.  In accordance with Section 4.2.1.3 of <xref target="RFC5280" />, if the KeyUsage extension is present, then the certificate MUST be used only for one of the purposes indicated.  There are two relevant keyUsage identifiers for the certificate corresponding to the public key algorithm in use:</t>
					<t>
					<list style="symbols">
					<t>The digitalSignature KeyUsage identifier MAY be used with certificates for x509v3-ssh-dss, x509v3-ssh-rsa, and x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-* public key algorithms.</t>
					<t>The keyAgreement KeyUsage identifier MAY be used for certificates with convey keys for use with the ecmqv-sha2 key exchange method.</t>
					</list>
					</t>

					<t>For the remaining certificates in the certificate chain, implementations MUST comply with existing conventions on KeyUsage identifiers and certificates as in Section 4.2.1.3 on <xref target="RFC5280" />.</t>
					
				</section>

				<section anchor="x509v3-ext-eku" title="ExtendedKeyUsage">

					<t>This document defines two ExtendedKeyUsage key purpose IDs that MAY be used to restrict a certificate's use: id-kp-secureShellClient, which indicates that the key can be used for a Secure Shell client, and id-kp-secureShellServer, which indicates that the key may be used for a Secure Shell server.  In accordance with Section 4.2.1.12 of <xref target="RFC5280" />, if the ExtendedKeyUsage extension is present, then the certificate MUST be used only for one of the purposes indicated.  The object identifiers of the two key purpose IDs defined in this document are as follows:</t>

					<t>
					<list style="symbols">
					<t>id-pkix OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) }</t>
					<t>id-kp   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 3 }    -- extended key purpose identifiers</t>
					<t>id-kp-secureShellClient        OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp 21 }</t>

	<section anchor="sigencoding" title="Signature Encoding">

		<t>Signing and verifying using the X.509v3-based public key algorithms specified in this document (x509v3-ssh-dss, x509v3-ssh-rsa, x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-*) is done in the analogous way for the corresponding non-X.509v3-based public key algorithms (ssh-dss, ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-*, respectively).  For concreteness, we specify this explicitly below.</t>

		<section anchor="sigencoding-dss" title="x509v3-ssh-dss">

			<t>Signing and verifying using the x509v3-ssh-dss key format is done according to the Digital Signature Standard <xref target="FIPS-186-2" /> using the SHA-1 hash <xref target="FIPS-180-2" />.</t>

			<t>The resulting signature is encoded as follows:</t>
			<figure>
			<artwork>
    string    "ssh-dss"
    string    dss_signature_blob</artwork>
			</figure>

			<t>The value for dss_signature_blob is encoded as a string containing r, followed by s (which are fixed-length 160-bit integers, without lengths or padding, unsigned, and in network byte order).</t>

			<t>This format is the same as for ssh-dss signatures in Section 6.6 of <xref target="RFC4253" />.</t>

		</section>

		<section anchor="sigencoding-rsa" title="x509v3-ssh-rsa">

			<t>Signing and verifying using the x509v3-ssh-rsa key format is performed according to the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 scheme in
<xref target="RFC3447" /> using the SHA-1 hash <xref target="FIPS-180-2" />.</t>

			<t>The resulting signature is encoded as follows:</t>
			<figure>
			<artwork>
    string    "ssh-rsa"
    string    rsa_signature_blob</artwork>
			</figure>

			<t>The value for rsa_signature_blob is encoded as a string containing s (which is an integer, without lengths or padding, unsigned, and in network byte order).</t>

			<t>This format is the same as for ssh-rsa signatures in Section 6.6 of <xref target="RFC4253" />.</t>

		</section>

		<section anchor="sigencoding-ecdsa" title="x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-*">

			<t>Signing and verifying using the x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-* key formats is performed according to the ECDSA algorithm in
<xref target="SEC1" /> using the SHA2 hash function family <xref target="FIPS-180-3" />.  The choice of hash function from the SHA2 hash function family is based on the key size of the ECDSA key as specified in Section 6.2.1 of <xref target="RFC5656" />.</t>

			<t>The resulting signature is encoded as follows:</t>
			<figure>
			<artwork>
    string    "ecdsa-sha2-[identifier]"
    string    ecdsa_signature_blob</artwork>
			</figure>

			<t>The string [identifier] is the identifier of the elliptic curve domain parameters. The format of this string is specified in Section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC5656" />.</t>

			<t>The ecdsa_signature_blob value has the following specific encoding:</t>
			<figure>
			<artwork>
   mpint    r
   mpint    s</artwork>
			</figure>

			<t>The integers r and s are the output of the ECDSA algorithm.</t>

	<section anchor="serverauth" title="Server Authentication (public key algorithm) Using X.509v3 Certificates">

		<t>When the X.509v3-based public key algorithms in this document are used for server authentication, the server's public host key is conveyed from the server to the client in the SSH_MSG_KEX*_REPLY_MSG, where * is either DH, RSA, ECDH or ECMQV.  All four key exchange protocols place the public host key in a string (K_S).  When one of the public key algorithms specified in this document is used, the string K_S MUST contain an encoding of the data structure specified in <xref target="x509v3" />.</t>

	</section>

	<section anchor="userauth" title="User Authentication (publickey authentication) Using X.509v3 Certificates">

		<t>When the X.509v3-based public key algorithms in this document are used for client authentication, the client initiates user authentication by sending an SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message to the server.  One of the options available to the client is to specify that a public key authentication method is to be used.  The list of user authentication public key algorithms defined for use in Secure Shell is precisely the same as the list of server authentication algorithms (public key algorithms) defined for use in Secure Shell.  Note that the choice of a user authentication public key algorithm is independent of the choice of a server authentication algorithm.</t>
 
		<t>The client's public key is conveyed in a string called the "public key blob".  The public key authentication algorithms specified in this document REQUIRE that the "public key blog" string contain an encoding of the data structure specified in <xref target="x509v3" />.</t>
		
	</section>

	<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

		<t>This document provides new public key algorithms for the Secure Shell protocol that convey public keys using X.509v3 certificates.  For the most part, the security considerations involved in using the Secure Shell protocol apply, since all of the public key algorithms introduced in this document are based on existing algorithms in the Secure Shell protocol.  However, implementers should be aware of security considerations specific to the use of X.509v3 certificates in a public key infrastructure, including considerations related to expired certificates and certificate revocation lists.</t>
		
		<t>The reader is directed to the security considerations sections of <xref target="RFC5280" /> for the use of X.509v3 certificates, <xref target="RFC2560" /> for the use of OCSP resonse, <xref target="RFC4253" /> for server authentication, and <xref target="RFC4252" /> for user authentication.</t>

	</section>

	<section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">

		<t>Consistent with Section 8 of <xref target="RFC4251" /> and Section 4.6 of <xref target="RFC4250" />, this document makes the following registrations:</t>

		<t>In the Public Key Algorithm Names registry:</t>
		
		<t>
		<list style="symbols">
		<t>The SSH public key algorithm "x509v3-ssh-dss".</t>
		<t>The SSH public key algorithm "x509v3-ssh-rsa".</t>
		<t>The family of SSH public key algorithm names beginning with "x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-" and not containing the at-sign ('@').</t>
		</list>
		</t>

		<t>This document creates no new registries.</t>

		<t>The two object identifiers used in <xref target="x509v3-ext-eku" /> were assigned from a private arc and need not be registered in an IANA registry.</t>
