 Session Matching Update for the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
                draft-ietf-simple-msrp-sessmatch-06.txt

Abstract

   This document updates the session matching procedure defined in
   sections 5.4 and 7.3 of RFC 4975, so that an Message Session Relay
   Protocol (MSRP) User Agent (UA) only uses the session-id part of the
   MSRP URI in order to perform the consistency checks.  The update
   allows intermediaries, Application Layer Gateways (ALGs), to modify
   the address information in the MSRP URI of the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) a=path attribute, without the need for the
   intermediaries to terminate and do the correlating modifications in
   the associated MSRP messages.

1.  Introduction

   The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) [RFC4975] is designed to
   use MSRP relays [RFC4976] as a means for NAT traversal and policy
   enforcement.

   Many networks in which MSRP usage is emerging also contain generic
   Application Layer Gateways (ALGs), which might control media relays
   and perform tasks such as performance monitoring, lawful intercept,
   address domain bridging, interconnect Service Layer Agreement (SLA)
   policy enforcement, etc.  An example here is the Interconnect Border
   Control Function (IBCF) [3GPP.23.228] defined by the 3rd Generation
   Partnership Project (3GPP), which controls a media relay that handles
   all types of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) session media (voice,
   video, MSRP, etc).

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) a=path attribute is used to
   establish the routeset for the MSRP messages associated with the
   session.  Due to the fact that MSRP UAs check consistency between
   address information in the MSRP messages and in the SDP a=path
   attribute, when an ALG modifies the address information of the a=path
   attribute, it forces the media relay of the ALG to act as an MSRP
   Back-To-Back User Agent (B2BUA) in order to perform the corresponding
   modifications in the MSRP messages, whereas for other media types the
   media relay only needs to modify the IP and transport headers.

   In order to use general NAT traversal methods and ALGs, this document
   updates the session matching procedures defined in section 7.3 of
   [RFC4975], so that MSRP endpoints only use the session-id part when
   they compare the MSRP URI in the SDP a=path attribute with the
   corresponding MSRP URI in MSRP messages.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability statement

   This document updates sections 5.4 (MSRP Connection Model) and 7.3
   (Receiving Requests) of [RFC4975].  An MSRP UA MUST implement the
   procedures defined in this document in order to interwork with remote
   MSRP UAs in a network where intermediaries might modify the address
   information in the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path attribute.

4.  Normative update of RFC 4975

4.1.  General

   This section replaces the text for the 10th paragraph of section 5.4
   (MSRP Connection Model), and the first paragraph of section 7.3
   (Receiving Requests), of [RFC4975].

4.2.  RFC4975: 5.4 MSRP Connection Model

   When the first request arrives, its To-Path header field should
   contain a URI with a session-id part that the listening element
   provided in the SDP for a session.  The element that accepted the
   connection looks up the session-id part of the URI in the received
   request, and determines which session it matches.  If a match exists,
   the node MUST assume that the host that formed the connection is the
   host to which this URI was given.  If no match exists, the node MUST
   reject the request with a 481 response.  The node MUST also check to
   make sure the session is not already in use on another connection.
   If the session is already in use, it MUST reject the request with a
   506 response.

4.3.  RFC4975: 7.3 Receiving Requests

   The receiving endpoint MUST first check the URI in the To-Path to
   make sure the request belongs to an existing session.  When the
   request is received, the To-Path will have exactly one URI, of which
   the session-id part MUST map to an existing session that is
   associated with the connection on which the request arrived.  The
   session-id part is compared as case sensitive, as specified in
   Section 6.1 (point 4) of [RFC4975].  If this is not true, then the
   receiver MUST generate a 481 error and ignore the request.  Note that
   if the Failure-Report header field had a value of "no", then no error
   report would be sent.


5.  Security Considerations

   Due to the change of the session matching procedure, MSRP endpoints
   can only check that the session-id part of the MSRP URI carried in
   the MSRP messages matches the session-id which was provided in the
   associated SDP a=path attribute.  Differing from [RFC4975], the host/
   domain part of the MSRP URI is thus not checked.  However, since a
   man-in-the-middle would in any case be able to modify the domain
   information in both the SDP and the MSRP messages, e.g. in order to
   insert itself in the MSRP signalling path or to route MSRP messages
   to non-intended entities, this does not introduce any new security
   risks.

   An MSRP UA treats its session URI as a shared secret to determine
   that an incoming transport connection is indeed from the signaled
   peer device.  An MSRP session URI therefore needs to be hard to
   guess.  However, [RFC4975] already requires the session-id part of
   the URI to be sufficiently hard to guess.  Furthermore, the
   addressing information in the domain part of the URI is relatively
   easy to guess.  This makes the difficulty in guessing the session-id
   roughly equivalent to the difficulty of guessing the entire URI.

   With this update, MSRP entities no longer use the MSRP URI domain
   part to perform session matching.  But if intermediaries modify the
   a=path attribute in the SDP, but do not modify the corresponding
   information in the associated MSRP messages, then the endpoints can
   determine that such modifications have been performed by comparing
   the domain information in the SDP with the domain information in the
   MSRP messages.  Based on this information, users can trigger some
   actions in order to check whether network entities work correctly, or
   whether a man-in-the-middle has modified the SDP a=path attribute,
   for the same reasons as described earlier.

   If an intermediary modifies the host part of an a=path attribute URI,
   there might be TLS authentication impacts depending on what type of
   certificates are used.  If self signed certificates are used, a
   modification would not impact TLS, since the host part is not used
   for the certificate matching.

   If public certificates are used, a modification of the host part
   (without performing similar modifications in the associated MSRP
   messages) would in most cases trigger a certificate matching error,
   since the host part is used in order to match the certificate.  This
   mismatch would cause the MSRP session setup to fail.  This does not
   apply if the host part is modified between two MSRP relays, since
   relays do not have access to the SDP information and use the To-Path
   and From-Path hosts for certificate matching purpose.
