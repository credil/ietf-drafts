           An IPv6 Routing Header for Source Routes with RPL
                 draft-ietf-6man-rpl-routing-header-04

Abstract

   In Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), memory constraints on routers
   may limit them to maintaining at most a few routes.  In some
   configurations, it is necessary to use these memory constrained
   routers to deliver datagrams to nodes within the LLN.  The Routing
   for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) protocol can be used in some
   deployments to store most, if not all, routes on one (e.g. the
   Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) root) or few routers and forward the
   IPv6 datagram using a source routing technique to avoid large routing
   tables on memory constrained routers.  This document specifies a new
   IPv6 Routing header type for delivering datagrams within a RPL
   domain.

Internet-Draft           RPL Source Route Header            October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Routing for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a distance vector
   IPv6 routing protocol designed for Low Power and Lossy networks (LLN)
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].  Such networks are typically constrained in
   resources (limited communication data rate, processing power, energy
   capacity, memory).  In particular, some LLN configurations may
   utilize LLN routers where memory constraints limit nodes to
   maintaining only a small number of default routes and no other
   destinations.  However, it may be necessary to utilize such memory-
   constrained routers to forward datagrams and maintain reachability to
   destinations within the LLN.

   To utilize paths that include memory-constrained routers, RPL relies
   on source routing.  In one deployment model of RPL, necessary
   mechanisms are used to collect routing information at more capable
   routers and form paths from those routers to arbitrary destinations
   within the RPL domain.  However, a source routing mechanism supported
   by IPv6 is needed to deliver datagrams.

   This document specifies the Source Routing Header (SRH) for use
   strictly within a RPL domain.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft           RPL Source Route Header            October 2011


2.  Overview

   The format of SRH draws from that of the Type 0 Routing header (RH0)
   [RFC2460].  However, SRH introduces mechanisms to compact the source
   route entries when all entries share the same prefix with the IPv6
   Destination Address of a packet carrying a SRH, a typical scenario in
   LLNs using source routing.  The compaction mechanism reduces
   consumption of scarce resources such as channel capacity.

   SRH also differs from RH0 in the processing rules to alleviate
   security concerns that led to the deprecation of RH0 [RFC5095].
   First, routers processing SRH MUST implement a strict source route
   policy where each and every IPv6 hop is specified within the datagram
   itself.  Second, a SRH header MUST only be used within a RPL domain.
   RPL Border Routers, responsible for connecting RPL domains and IP
   domains that use other routing protocols, MUST NOT allow datagrams
   already carrying a SRH header to enter or exit the RPL domain.
   Third, routers along the way MUST verify that loops do not exist with
   in the source route.

   To deliver a datagram, a router MAY specify a source route to reach
   the destination using a SRH.  There are two cases that determine how
   to include an SRH with a datagram.

   1.  If the SRH specifies the complete path from source to
       destination, the SRH should be included directly within the
       datagram itself.

   2.  If the SRH only specifies a subset of the path from source to
       destination, the router SHOULD use IPv6-in-IPv6 tunneling, as
       specified in [RFC2473].  When tunneling, the router MUST prepend
       a new IPv6 header and SRH to the original datagram.  Use of
       tunneling ensures that the datagram is delivered unmodified and
       that ICMP errors return to the source of the SRH rather than the
       source of the original datagram.

   In a RPL network, Case 1 occurs when both source and destinations are
   within a RPL domain and a single SRH header is used to specify the
   entire path from source to destination, as shown in the following
   figure:


                           +--------------------+
                           |                    |
                           |  (S) -------> (D)  |
                           |                    |
                           +--------------------+
                                  RPL Domain

Internet-Draft           RPL Source Route Header            October 2011


   In the above scenario, datagrams traveling from source, S, to
   destination, D, have the following packet structure:


                   +--------+---------+-------------//-+
                   | IPv6   | Source  | IPv6           |
                   | Header | Routing | Payload        |
                   |        | Header  |                |
                   +--------+---------+-------------//-+


   S's address is carried in the IPv6 Header's Source Address field.
   D's address is carried in the last entry of SRH for all but the last
   hop, when D's address is carried in the IPv6 Header's Destination
   Address field of the packet carrying the SRH.

   In a RPL network, Case 2 occurs for all datagrams that have either
   source or destination outside the RPL domain, as shown in the
   following diagram:


                     +-----------------+
                     |                 |
                     |  (S) -------> (BR1) -------> (D)
                     |                 |
                     +-----------------+
                          RPL Domain

                     +-----------------+
                     |                 |
                     |  (D) <------- (BR1) <------- (S)
                     |                 |
                     +-----------------+
                          RPL Domain


   In the above scenario, datagrams that include the SRH in tunneled
   mode have the following packet structure when traveling within the
   RPL domain:


              +--------+---------+--------+-------------//-+
              | Outer  | Source  | Inner  | IPv6           |
              | IPv6   | Routing | IPv6   | Payload        |
              | Header | Header  | Header |                |
              +--------+---------+--------+-------------//-+
                                  <--- Original Packet --->
               <---           Tunneled Packet            --->

   Note that the outer header (including the SRH) is added and removed
   by the RPL Border Router.

   Case 2 also occurs whenever a RPL router needs to insert a source
   route when forwarding datagram.  One such use case with RPL is to
   have all RPL traffic flow through a Border Router and have the Border
   Router use source routes to deliver datagrams to their final
   destination.  When including the SRH using tunneled mode, the Border
   Router would encapsulate the received datagram unmodified using IPv6-
   in-IPv6 and include a SRH in the outer IPv6 header.


                           +-----------------+
                           |                 |
                           |  (S) -------\   |
                           |              \  |
                           |               (BR1)
                           |              /  |
                           |  (D) <------/   |
                           |                 |
                           +-----------------+
                                RPL Domain


   In the above scenario, datagrams travel from S to D through BR1.
   Between S and BR1, the datagrams are routed using the DAG built by
   RPL and do not contain a SRH.  BR1 encapsulates received datagrams
   unmodified using IPv6-in-IPv6 and the SRH is included in the outer
   IPv6 header.

3.  Format of the RPL Routing Header

   The Source Routing Header has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                                                               |
     .                                                               .
     .                        Addresses[1..n]                        .
     .                                                               .
     |                                                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Next Header         8-bit selector.  Identifies the type of header
                       immediately following the Routing header.  Uses
                       the same values as the IPv4 Protocol field
                       [RFC3232].

   Hdr Ext Len         8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Routing
                       header in 8-octet units, not including the first
                       8 octets.  Note that when Addresses[1..n] are
                       compressed (i.e. value of CmprI or CmprE is not
                       0), Hdr Ext Len does not equal twice the number
                       of Addresses.

   Routing Type        8-bit selector.  TBD by IANA.

   Segments Left       8-bit unsigned integer.  Number of route segments
                       remaining, i.e., number of explicitly listed
                       intermediate nodes still to be visited before
                       reaching the final destination.

   CmprI               4-bit unsigned integer.  Number of prefix octets
                       from each segment, except than the last segment,
                       (i.e. segments 1 through n-1) that are elided.
                       For example, a SRH carrying full IPv6 addresses
                       in Addresses[1..n-1] sets CmprI to 0.

Internet-Draft           RPL Source Route Header            October 2011


   CmprE               4-bit unsigned integer.  Number of prefix octets
                       from the last segment (i.e. segment n) that are
                       elided.  For example, a SRH carrying a full IPv6
                       address in Addresses[n] sets CmprE to 0.

   Pad                 4-bit unsigned integer.  Number of octets that
                       are used for padding after Address[n] at the end
                       of the SRH.

   Address[1..n]       Vector of addresses, numbered 1 to n.  Each
                       vector element in [1..n-1] has size (16 - CmprI)
                       and element [n] has size (16-CmprE).

   The SRH shares the same basic format as the Type 0 Routing header
   [RFC2460].  When carrying full IPv6 addresses, the CmprI, CmprE, and
   Pad fields are set to 0 and the only difference between the SRH and
   Type 0 encodings is the value of the Routing Type field.

   A common network configuration for a RPL domain is that all nodes
   within a LLN share a common prefix.  The SRH introduces the CmprI,
   CmprE, and Pad fields to allow compaction of the Address[1..n] vector
   when all entries share the same prefix as the IPv6 Destination
   Address field of the packet carrying the SRH.  The CmprI and CmprE
   field indicates the number of prefix octets that are shared with the
   IPv6 Destination Address of the packet carrying the SRH.  The shared
   prefix octets are not carried within the Routing header and each
   entry in Address[1..n-1] has size (16 - CmprI) octets and Address[n]
   has size (16 - CmprE) octets.  When CmprI or CmprE is non-zero, there
   may exist unused octets between the last entry, Address[n], and the
   end of the Routing header.  The Pad field indicates the number of
   unused octets that are used for padding.  Note that when CmprI and
   CmprE are both 0, Pad MUST carry a value of 0.

   The SRH MUST NOT specify a path that visits a node more than once.
   When generating a SRH, the source may not know the mapping between
   IPv6 addresses and nodes.  Minimally, the source MUST ensure that
   IPv6 Addresses do not appear more than once and the IPv6 Source and
   Destination addresses of the encapsulating datagram do not appear in
   the SRH.

   Multicast addresses MUST NOT appear in a SRH, or in the IPv6
   Destination Address field of a datagram carrying a SRH.

4.  RPL Router Behavior

4.1.  Generating Source Routing Headers

   To deliver an IPv6 datagram to its destination, a router may need to
   generate a new SRH and specify a strict source route.  Routers MUST
   use IPv6-in-IPv6 tunneling, as specified in [RFC2473] to include a
   new SRH in datagrams that are sourced by other nodes.  Using IPv6-in-
   IPv6 tunneling ensures that the delivered datagram remains unmodified
   and that ICMPv6 errors generated by a SRH are sent back to the router
   that generated the routing header.

   To avoid fragmentation, it is desirable to employ MTU sizes that
   allow for the header expansion (i.e. at least 1280 + 40 (outer IP
   header) + SRH_MAX_SIZE), where SRH_MAX_SIZE is the maximum path
   length for a given RPL network.  To take advantage of this, however,
   the communicating endpoints need to be aware of the MTU along the
   path (i.e. through Path MTU Discovery).  Unfortunately, the larger
   MTU size may not be available on all links (e.g. 1280 octets on
   6LoWPAN links).  However, it is expected that much of the traffic on
   these types of networks consists of much smaller messages than the
   MTU, so performance degradation through fragmentation would be
   limited.

4.2.  Processing Source Routing Headers

   As specified in [RFC2460], a routing header is not examined or
   processed until it reaches the node identified in the Destination
   Address field of the IPv6 header.  In that node, dispatching on the
   Next Header field of the immediately preceding header causes the
   Routing header module to be invoked.

   The function of SRH is intended to be very similar to IPv4's Strict
   Source and Record Route option [RFC0791].  After the routing header
   has been processed and the IPv6 datagram resubmitted to the IPv6
   module for processing, the IPv6 Destination Address contains the next
   hop's address.  When forwarding an IPv6 datagram that contains a SRH
   with a non-zero Segments Left value, if the IPv6 Destination Address
   is not on-link, a router SHOULD send an ICMP Destination Unreachable
   (ICMPv6 Type 1) message with ICMPv6 Code set to (TBD by IANA) to the
   packet's Source Address.  This ICMPv6 Code indicates that the IPv6
   Destination Address is not on-link and the router cannot satisfy the
   strict source route requirement.  When generating ICMPv6 error
   messages, the rules in Section 2.4 of [RFC4443] must be observed.

   To detect loops in the SRH, a router MUST determine if the SRH
   includes multiple addresses assigned to any interface on that router.
   If such addresses appear more than once and are separated by at least

   one address not assigned to that router, the router MUST drop the
   packet and SHOULD send an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, to the
   Source Address.  While this loop check does add significant per-
   packet processing overhead, it is required to mitigate traffic
   amplification attacks that led to the deprecation of RH0 [RFC5095].

   The following describes the algorithm performed when processing a
   SRH:

    if Segments Left = 0 {
       proceed to process the next header in the packet, whose type is
       identified by the Next Header field in the Routing header
    }
    else {
       compute n, the number of addresses in the Routing header, by
       n = (((Hdr Ext Len * 8) - Pad - (16 - CmprE)) / (16 - CmprI)) + 1

       if Segments Left is greater than n {

          Address, pointing to the Segments Left field, and discard the

5.  RPL Border Router Behavior

   RPL Border Routers (referred to as LBRs in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology]) are responsible for ensuring that a SRH
   is only used within the RPL domain it was created.

   For datagrams destined to the RPL Border Router, the router processes
   the packet in the usual way.  For instance, if the SRH was included
   using tunneled mode and the RPL Border Router serves as the tunnel
   endpoint, the router removes the outer IPv6 header, at the same time
   removing the SRH as well.

   Datagrams destined elsewhere within the same RPL domain are forwarded
   to the correct interface.

   Datagrams destined to nodes outside the RPL domain are dropped if the
   outer-most IPv6 header contains a SRH.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Source Routing Attacks

   [RFC5095] deprecates the Type 0 Routing header due to a number of
   significant attacks that are referenced in that document.  Such
   attacks include network discovery, bypassing filtering devices,
   denial-of-service, and defeating anycast.

   Because this document specifies that SRH is only for use within a RPL
   domain, such attacks cannot be mounted from outside the RPL domain.
   As described in Section 5, RPL Border Routers MUST drop datagrams
   entering or exiting the RPL domain that contain a SRH in the IPv6
   Extension headers.  Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that non-RPL
   routers and firewalls drop packets with a SRH by default.

6.2.  ICMPv6 Attacks

   The generation of ICMPv6 error messages may be used to attempt
   denial-of-service attacks by sending error-causing SRH in back-to-
   back datagrams.  An implementation that correctly follows Section 2.4
   of [RFC4443] would be protected by the ICMPv6 rate limiting
   mechanism.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new IPv6 Routing Type of TBD by IANA.

   This document defines a new ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable Code of
   TBD by IANA to indicate that the router cannot satisfy the strict
   source-route requirement.

   (This section to be removed by the RFC editor.)

   Draft 04:

      - Updated text on recommendations for avoiding fragmentation.

      - Clarify definition of CmprE where it is first mentioned.

      - Change use of IPv6-in-IPv6 tunneling from SHOULD to MUST.

      - Update packet processing pseudocode to match the text on sending
      back a parameter problem error.

      - Recommend that non-RPL devices drop packets with SRH by default.

      - Clarify packet structure figures.

      - State that checking for cycles represents significant per-packet
      processing.

   Draft 03:

      - Removed any presumed values that are TBD by IANA.

   Draft 02:

      - Updated to send ICMP Destination Unreachable error only after
      the SRH has been processed.

      - Updated pseudocode to reflect encoding changes in draft-01.

      - Allow multiple addresses assigned to same node as long as they
      are not separated by other addresses.

   Draft 01:

      - Allow Addresses[1..n-1] and Addresses[n] to have a different
      number of bytes elided.
