Internet-Draft               G.Bond ATM MIB                     May 2011


1.  Introduction

   The ATM-Based Multi-Pair Bonding, a.k.a.  G.Bond/ATM, is specified in
   ITU-T G.998.1 recommendation [G.998.1], which defines a method for
   bonding (or aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer
   channels in multiple xDSL lines) into a single bi-directional logical
   link carrying an ATM stream.

   This specification can be viewed as an evolution of the legacy
   Inverse Multiplexing over ATM (IMA) technology [af-phy-0086], applied
   to xDSL with variable rates on each line/bearer channel.  As with the
   other bonding schemes, ATM bonding also allows bonding of up to 32
   individual sub-layers with variable rates, providing common
   functionality for the configuration, initialization, operation and
   monitoring of the bonded link.

   The MIB module, defined in this document, defines a set of managed
   objects for the management of G.998.1 bonded interfaces, extending
   the common objects specified in the GBOND-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The DSL Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding

   This document makes use of the DSL Forum technical report Management
   Framework for xDSL Bonding [TR-159], defining a management model and
   a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded xDSL interfaces.

4.  Relationship to other MIB modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB) and G.Bond MIB (GBOND-MIB).

4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB module

   A G.Bond/ATM port is a private case of a Bonded multi-pair xDSL
   interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
   objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].  In particular an interface
   index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of G.Bond/ATM ports, as
   well as xDSL lines/channels, in a managed system.

4.2.  Relationship to G.Bond MIB module

   GBOND-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module defines management
   objects common for all Bonded multi-pair xDSL interfaces.  In
   particular it describes the bonding management, bonded port and
   channel configuration, initialization sequence etc.

   Both GBOND-MIB and GBOND-ATM-MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage a
   G.Bond/ATM port.

4.3.  Relationship to ATM MIB module

   ATM-MIB [RFC2515] module defines management objects for an ATM
   interface.

   ATM-MIB module can be used to manage the ATM aspects of a G.Bond/ATM
   port.

5.  MIB Structure

5.1.  Overview

   All management objects defined in the GBOND-ATM-MIB module are
   contained in a single group gBondAtmPort.  This group is further
   split into 4 sub-groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181
   [RFC4181]:

   o  gBondTdimPortNotifications - containing notifications (Up/
      Downstream Diff.  Delay Tolerance Exceeded).

   o  gBondAtmPortConfTable - containing objects for configuration of a
      G.Bond/ATM port.

Internet-Draft               G.Bond ATM MIB                     May 2011


   o  gBondAtmPortStatusTable - containing objects providing overall
      status information of a G.Bond/ATM port, complementing the generic
      status information from the ifTable of IF-MIB and gBondFltStatus
      of GBOND-MIB.

   o  gBondAtmPM - containing objects providing historical performance
      monitoring (PM) information of a G.Bond/ATM port, complementing
      the PM information from the gBondPortPM of GBOND-MIB.

   Note that the rest of the objects for the Generic Bonded Sub-layer
   (GBS) port configuration, capabilities, status, notifications and
   performance monitoring is located in the GBOND-MIB module.

5.2.  Performance Monitoring

   The OPTIONAL performance monitoring counters, thresholds and history
   buckets (interval-counters) are implemented using the textual
   conventions defined in the HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3705].  The HC-
   PerfHist-TC-MIB defines 64-bit versions of the textual conventions
   found in PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3593].

   The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a fifteen
   minute boundary of a wall clock.  Likewise, the beginning of each one
   day intervals SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when a GBS is reinitialized, but rather only
   when the agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request
   outside the scope of this MIB module).

5.3.  Mapping of Broadband Forum TR-159 Managed Objects

   This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects
   (attributes) defined in [TR-159] and the managed objects defined in
   this document.

7.  Security Considerations

   There is a number of managed objects defined in the GBOND-ATM-MIB
   module that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Writing to these
   objects can have potentially disruptive effects on network operation,
   for example:

   o  Changing of gBondAtmPortConfTable configuration parameters MAY
      lead to a potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) breach, for
      example if a traffic delay is increased as a result of the higher
      delay tolerance (increased gBondAtmUpDiffDelayTolerance and/or
      gBondAtmDnDiffDelayTolerance), or the differential delay tolerance
      notifications are disabled by manipulating the
      gBondAtmDiffDelayToleranceExceededEnable parameter.

   The user of the GBOND-ATM-MIB module must therefore be aware that
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in the GBOND-ATM-MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in
   some environments since, collectively, they provide information about
   the performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.

   In such environments it is important to control also GET and NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   An object identifier for gBondAtmMIB MODULE-IDENTITY SHALL be
   allocated by IANA [1] in the MIB-2 transmission sub-tree, before this
   document is published as an RFC.
