Internet-Draft     Addition of Camellia cipher for TLS     February 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [6] protocol to support the Camellia
   [2] encryption algorithm as a block cipher algorithm.  The proposed
   cipher suites include variants using SHA-2 family of cryptographic
   hash functions and Galois counter mode (GCM) [11].  Elliptic curve
   cipher suites and pre-shared key (PSK) cipher suites are also
   included.

   The Camellia algorithm and its properties are described in [2].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].

2.  Proposed Cipher Suites

2.1.  HMAC based Cipher Suites

   The eight cipher suites use Camellia [2] in Cipher Block Chaining
   (CBC) [2] mode with a SHA-2 family HMAC using elliptic curves
   encryption:

   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD};
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD};
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256  = {TBD,TBD};
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384  = {TBD,TBD};
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256   = {TBD,TBD};
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384   = {TBD,TBD};
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256    = {TBD,TBD};
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384    = {TBD,TBD};

2.2.  Galois Counter Mode(GCM) based Cipher Suites

   The twenty cipher suites use the same asymmetric key algorithms as
   those in the previous section but use the authenticated encryption
   modes defined in TLS 1.2 [6] with the Camellia in GCM [11].

  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256          = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384          = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256      = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384      = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256       = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384       = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256      = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384      = {TBD,TBD};

  CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384       = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256      = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384      = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256  = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384  = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256   = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384   = {TBD,TBD};

2.3.  Pre-Shared Key (PSK) based Cipher Suites

   The fourteen cipher suites describe pre-shared key cipher suites.
   The first six cipher suites use Camellia with GCM and the next eight
   cipher suites use the Camellia with SHA-2 family HMAC using
   asymmetric key encryption or elliptic curves encryption.

    CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256        = {TBD,TBD};
    CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384        = {TBD,TBD};
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256    = {TBD,TBD};

3.  Cipher Suite Definitions

3.1.  Key Exchange

   The RSA, DHE_RSA, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DH_DSS, ECDH, DH_anon, and ECDHE
   key exchanges are performed as defined in RFC5246 [6].

3.2.  Cipher

   The CAMELLIA_128_CBC cipher suites use Camellia [2] in CBC mode with
   a 128-bit key and 128-bit IV; the CAMELLIA_256_CBC cipher suites use
   a 256-bit key and 128-bit IV.

   AES authenticated encryption with additional data algorithms,
   AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM are described in RFC5116 [5].
   And AES GCM cipher suites for TLS are described in RFC5288 [7].  AES
   and Camellia share common characteristics including key sizes and
   block length.  CAMELLIA_128_GCM and CAMELLIA_256_GCM are defined
   according as those of AES.

3.3.  PRFs

   The hash algorithms and PRF algorithms for TLS 1.2 SHALL be as
   follows:

   a) The cipher suites ending with _SHA256 use HMAC-SHA-256 as the MAC
   algorithm, The PRF is the TLS PRF [6] with SHA-256 as the hash
   function,
   b) The cipher suites ending with _SHA384 use HMAC-SHA-384 as the MAC
   algorithm, The PRF is the TLS PRF [6] with SHA-384 as the hash
   function.

   When used with TLS versions prior to 1.2, the PRF is calculated as
   specified in the appropriate version of the TLS specification.

3.4.  PSK cipher suites

   Pre-shared key cipher suites for TLS are described in RFC4279 [3],
   RFC4785 [4], RFC5487 [9], and RFC5489 [10].

Internet-Draft     Addition of Camellia cipher for TLS     February 2011


4.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys for
   Camellia.  And no security problem has been found on Camellia (see
   NESSIE [12], CRYPTREC [13], and LNCS 5867[14]).

   The security considerations in previous RFCs (RFC4279 [3], RFC4785
   [4], RFC5116 [5], RFC5288 [7], RFC5289 [8], RFC5487 [9]), and GCM
   [11] apply to this document as well.
