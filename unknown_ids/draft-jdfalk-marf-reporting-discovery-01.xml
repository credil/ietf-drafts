		<abstract>
			<t>This document defines a method for network operators to
			advertise their willingness to send feedback about received
			email to other parties, and for those other parties to
			advertise their willingness to receive such feedback.</t>
		</abstract>
	</front>
	
	<middle>
		<section title="Introduction">
			<t> As the spam problem continues to expand and potential
		    solutions evolve, network operators are increasingly
		    exchanging abuse reports among themselves and other
		    parties.  While <xref target="MARF-BASE"/> defines the
			Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) for these reports, it assumes 
			that the operators will use some undefined method to 
			discover each other and enter into any necessary agreements. </t>
			<t> The advertisement method defined in this memo is
			intended to ease the process for potential ARF recipients
			to discover whether a particular Administrative Domain (ADMD)
			has the facility and willingness to generate ARF reports, 
			and for ARF generators to discover whether a particular ADMD is
			able and willing to receive ARF reports.  Also included
			is a facility for end-user MUAs to discover whether there
			is an abuse reporting address within their own ADMD. </t>
			<t> This document only defines the process for advertisement
			and discovery of feedback recipients.  Determination of
			when it is appropriate to send feedback or how trust may be
			established between report generators and report recipients 
			is outside the scope of this document.
			It is assumed that best practices will evolve over time,
			and will be codified in future documents.</t>
		</section>
		
		<section title="Purpose">
			<t> The reports defined in <xref target="MARF-BASE"/> are
			intended to inform mail operators about:
			
			<list style="symbols">
				<t> email abuse originating from their networks; </t>
				<t> potential issues with the perceived quality of outbound mail, such
				    as email service providers sending mail that attracts the
				    attention of automated abuse detection systems. </t>
			</list>
			
			To support these purposes, this document addresses
			three primary use cases:
			
			<list style="symbols">
				<t> Any ADMD may advertise its willingness to 
					receive reports from the internet at large,
					given particular criteria included in or
					referenced by the advertisement; </t>
				<t> Any ADMD may advertise their willingness to
					provide reports to the Internet at large,
					given particular criteria included in or
					referenced by the advertisement; </t>
				<t> Any ADMD may advertise the method for their own
					end users to report issues directly (likely through
					their MUA), so that these reports may be handled
					through that ADMD's own policies -- which may
					include distribution to another ADMD in the form
					of an ARF message. </t>
			</list>
			
			This specification also inherits from 
			<xref target="MARF-BASE"/> that it is intended
			specifically for communications among providers
			regarding email abuse and related issues, and
			SHOULD NOT be used for other reports.  For 
			example, the <xref target="DKIM-REPORTING"/> extension
			includes its own ARF recipient discovery method
			which should not be confused with the method
			defined in this memo.
		</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Requirements">
			<t> The advertisement and discovery process must be easily
			accessible to the software involved in providing email
			service, preferably using concepts and technologies an
			email operator can be assumed to be familiar with.  Thus,
			following the examples of <xref target="DKIM"/> and
			<xref target="DKIM-REPORTING"/>, the advertisement is
			in the form of a <xref target="DNS"/> TXT record.  While
			this may provide challenges for offline processing, this
			is outweighed by the advantages of security and 
			maintainability. </t>
			<t> In order to reflect current usage, advertisements must
			also provide the ability to reference complex "terms of
			service" or other documents outside of the scope of a
			simple discovery method.  This is accomplished through
			the inclusion of a URI. </t>
			<t> And finally, the advertisement must be readable by
			humans (assuming they have access to this memo) as well
			as software specifically written for the purpose. </t>
		</section>

		<section title="Language">
			<t> This section defines various terms used throughout
			this document. </t>
			<section title="General">
				<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
			    "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
			    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
			    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
			    are to be interpreted as described in
			    <xref target="KEYWORDS"/>. </t>
			</section>
			<section title="Email Specific">
				<t><xref target="EMAIL-ARCH"/> introduces
			    several terms and concepts that are used
			    in this memo, and thus readers are advised
			    to become familiar with it as well. </t>
			</section>
			<section title="ARF Specific">
				<t><xref target="MARF-BASE"/> introduces terms 
				and concepts that are necessary for a full
				understanding of this memo, and thus readers
				are advised to read it before continuing. </t>
			</section>
		</section>

		<section anchor="advertisements" 
				title="Characteristics of a Feedback Reporting Advertisement">
			<t> An advertisement of willingness to generate or receive
				feedback is accomplished by publishing a TXT record in the
				<xref target="DNS"/> using the name '_report' within the given
				DNS domain. </t>

			<t> In the case of a feedback consumer, the advertisement should be 
				published in the DNS domain matching the <xref target="DKIM"/>
				'd=' value used on outgoing signatures, and/or in the DNS domain 
				matching the one present in the <xref target="SMTP"/> MAIL 
				commands it issues when sending mail, and/or in the DNS domain
				referenced by the DNS PTR record of the IP address of the border
				MTA used to transfer the message outside of its ADMD. </t>

			<t> In the case of a feedback generator, to inquire whether or 
				not an ADMD wishes to receive feedback reports, the DNS 
				domain to which the report should be sent is determined 
				(using a mechanism at the discretion of the generator) and 
				then a TXT record query to the above name is issued.  For 
				example, if a report generator wishes to generate a report 
				about a message bearing DNS domain ‘example.com’, the 
				generator would issue a TXT record query for `_report.example.com’. </t>

			<t> In the case of a feedback generator soliciting reports from
				its own end users, the advertisement will be associated
				with the host that provides <xref target="IMAP"/> or
				<xref target="POP"/> service to that user.  For example,
				when the user's IMAP server is imap.example.net, the applicable
				advertisement will be found at _report.imap.example.net. </t>
