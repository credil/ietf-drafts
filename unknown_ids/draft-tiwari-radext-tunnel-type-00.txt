INTERNET-DRAFT           New Tunnel-Type Values            9 August 2008


1.  Introduction

   The RADIUS protocol is defined in [RFC2865].  "RADIUS Attributes for
   Tunnel Protocol Support" [RFC2868] Section 3.1 defines the Tunnel-
   Type Attribute.  This document defines a set of new values for the
   Tunnel-Type Attribute.

   In [RFC2868] Section 3.1, two values relating to IPsec Tunnel-mode
   are allocated, one for "IP Authentication Header in the Tunnel-mode
   (AH)" (6), and one for for "IP Encapsulating Security Payload in the
   Tunnel-mode (ESP)" (9).  While the key management mechanisms are not
   stated, it is assumed that these include either Internet Key Exchange
   (IKE) [RFC2409] or manual keying via the Tunnel-Password Attribute
   defined in [RFC2868] Section 3.5.

   Since then, IKEv2 [RFC4306] has been developed, and the specification
   for ESP has been revised [RFC4303].  This document requests
   allocation of additional Tunnel-Type values for "IP Encapsulating
   Security Payload in the Tunnel-mode (ESP) with IKEv2", as well as for
   the "Simple Symmetric Transport Protocol" [SSTP].

2.  Tunnel-Type Values

   This document defines new values for the Tunnel-Type Attribute.  This
   specification concerns the following values:

   14     IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] in the
          Tunnel-mode with IKEv2 [RFC4306]

   15     Simple Symmetric Transport Protocol (SSTP) [SSTP]

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests assignment of new values of the RADIUS Tunnel-
   Type Attribute by IANA in the appropriate registry [RADTYP].

   The new values being requested are:

   Tunnel-Type                                       Value
   =========                                         ====
   IP Encapsulating Security Payload in the
   Tunnel-mode (ESP) with IKEv2                      14
   Simple Symmetric Transport Protocol (SSTP)        15

   Additional values of the Tunnel-Type Attribute are allocated as
   described in [RFC2868] Section 6.1 (IETF Consensus).  Allocation of
   attribute values is also discussed in [RFC3575] Section 2.1.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification neither adds to nor detracts from the security of
   the RADIUS protocol.
