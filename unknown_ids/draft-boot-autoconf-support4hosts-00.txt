Internet-Draft         Support for hosts in MANETs         November 2010


1.  Introduction

   In Mobile Ad hoc Networks [RFC2501], host support can be provided by
   using address assignment as described in this document.  No central
   server is used and duplicate address detection can be fully
   supported.

   The IP Addressing Model in Ad Hoc Networks [RFC5889] argues that no
   on-link subnet prefix is configured on interfaces to links, where no
   assumptions of connectivity to other interfaces can be assumed.  A
   straightforward method for this is advertising prefixes with Router
   Advertisements, where the Prefix Information Option L-bit is set to 0
   [RFC4861].  For support for IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration,
   the A-bit is set to 1 [RFC4862].

   The IPv6 6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291] is used unmodified, with
   support for 64-bit Interface IDs.  Interface IDs are generated by the
   hosts, using for example Modified EUI-64 [RFC4291], Cryptographically
   Generated Addresses [RFC3972] or Randomized Interface Identifiers
   [RFC4941].

   Each MANET router has assigned one or more 64-bit prefixes.
   Procedures for prefix assignment are out of scope for this document.
   The prefixes are assigned MANET router exclusively, and reachability
   to addresses in these prefixes is handled by the MANET protocol.

   Hosts may send out packets to any reachable router, listed in the
   default router list.  Hosts receive packets via the router that owns
   the prefix of the destination address of the received packet.  Hosts
   may use multiple source addresses, which may be useful for for
   example multi-path transport protocols and other types of load
   balancing.

   Smooth handover can be supported if methods are implemented for
   detecting reachability problems with the router that provided the
   used prefix.  Options are running a MANET protocol on the host or a
   mobility solution.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Address assignment to hosts

   Assume a topology as depicted below.  Routers RtrA, RtrB and RtrC

   send RAs.  Host1 receives only advertisements from RtrA and RtrB.

                                 <~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~>
          <~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~>
   <~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~>     |
           <~|~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~|~~>         |
          +--|--+     +--|--+     +--|--+      +--+--+
          | RtrA|<===>|Host1|<===>| RtrB|      | RtrC|
          +-----+     +-----+     +-----+      +-----+

   Host1 may autoconfigure addresses with prefixes provided by RtrA and
   RtrB.  It may perform duplicate address detection as described in
   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC4862] or Optimistic DAD
   for IPv6 [RFC4429].

   Standard duplicate address detection is limited to a single hop.  In
   the topology depicted above, with a single host, this is sufficient.
   An address generated with the prefix from RtrA can only collide with
   RtrA itself.  Same applies for address with prefix from RtrB.  Also,
   self-generated addresses are likely unique by nature.

   But in the topology below, an undetected address collision may occur,
   although it is very unlikely.  If a network manager requires
   guarantee on preventing duplicate addresses, (s)he can implement a
   DAD proxy function on the MANET routers [I-D.costa-6man-dad-proxy].
   As the prefixes are allocated to the MANET routers exclusively, each
   router manages its own prefixes and no router to router signaling is
   needed.

            <~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>
                           <~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~>
   <~~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~>         |

              +-----+       +-----+      +-----+


3.  Reachability establishment

   This addressing mechanism sticks to the current IPv6 model, where
   reachability between hosts on different links is arranged by routers.
   In a MANET, no assumptions can be made on connectivity between
   interfaces, which results in a recommendation for not using on-link
   prefixes [RFC5889].  Packet forwarding between hosts is always lead
   via one ore more MANET routers, unless link-local addresses are used
   and direct reachability between the hosts exists.  However, usage of
   link-local addresses is not recommended, as non-link-local addresses
   provide better support for session continuity in mobile environments.

   Host outbound traffic is straightforward, the host just picks a next-
   hop address from the Default Router List [RFC4861], as the Prefix
   List for the interface connected to the MANET is empty.  Also,
   default router preferences and preferences for more specific routes
   can be used [RFC4191].  Hosts may use more sophisticated default
   router selection mechanisms, using the router via a low cost link,
   the router that provided the prefix used for generating the source
   address or capture topology information of the MANET protocol and
   select a shortest path to the destination.

   Host inbound traffic is also straightforward, the router that
   provided the prefix of a packet destination address also provides
   connectivity to that address.  MANET routers inject the 64-bit (or
   shorter length) prefixes in the MANET protocol, all routers in the
   MANET calculate a route to that prefix, or can calculate in case of
   reactive MANET routing protocols.


4.  Mobility support

   Reachability problems occur when hosts loose connectivity to routers
   that provided the used prefix for address generation.  In the picture
   below, Host1 has configured an address with a prefix provided by
   RtrA.  After movement of Host1, it lost its connection with RtrA and
   therefore Host1 is not reachable anymore via RtrA with a RtrA owned
   prefix.  It can configure a new address from another nearby router,
   in this case RtrB.


          <~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~>
   <~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~>
           <~|~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~>   |
          +--|--+     +--|--+           +--|--+
          | RtrA|<===>|Host1|           | RtrB|
          +-----+     +-----+           +-----+

          Before movement, Host1 uses prefix from RtrA


          <~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~>
   <~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~>
             |     <~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~>
          +--|--+           +--|--+     +--|--+
          | RtrA|           |Host1|<===>| RtrB|
          +-----+           +-----+     +-----+

          After movement, Host1 switches to RtrB

   MANET routing protocols are designed for solving these problems.  A
   host may implement a MANET protocol and still keep the host
   characteristic by not forwarding packets.  Using this approach, the
   generated addresses are advertised as 128-bit prefixes, this will
   ensure independent path calculation for each host that has configured
   an address from the same 64-bit prefix.  This solution does not
   require renumbering, a host can use a single 128-bit prefix and keep
   being reachable when moving within the MANET.  However, running the
   MANET protocols on a large number of hosts may have a burden on MANET
   scalability.

   Alternatively, hosts may generate new addresses when point of
   attachment to the MANET changes.  Such renumbering breaks session
   continuity, so an additional mobility solution is needed.  Mobility
   solutions are already available and can be used in the MANET
   scenario.

   Mobility Support in IPv6 (MIP6) [RFC3775], is designed for macro
   mobility.  Mobile nodes use a Home Agent on the Internet and bind the
   care-of address(es) to a home address.  Session continuity using the
   home address is arranged using a tunnel.  Changes in care-of
   addresses are handled by updating the Home Agent - Mobile Node
   tunnel.  The router that provides the prefix to the host may also
   perform the Home Agent role, this enables mobility support for
   isolated MANETs.

   Multihoming Shim Protocol for IPv6 (SHIM6), [RFC5533] provides basic
   mechanisms for multi-homed nodes with session continuity in case of
   communication failures with certain address pairs.  It does not
   provide a mechanism to set up connections to a fixed IP address, used
   as identifier.

   Host Identity Protocol (HIP), [RFC4423] decouples endpoint
   identifiers with the network layer addresses used for packet
   forwarding.  As such, HIP mobility support is straightforward.

   The Identificator-Locator Network Protocol ILNP [I-D.rja-ilnp-intro]
   updates the IPv6 addressing model, the 128-bit address is decomposed
   to a 64-bit locator and a 64-bit identifier.  Locators may change
   anytime during a connection, without an effect on continuity.

   For connection setup to mobile nodes, mobility solutions use
   rendezvous points.  On these servers, temporary IP addresses, used as
   locator, are coupled with the more stable IP addresses or domain
   names, used as identifier.  The rendezvous points can be central
   servers, such as in the case of MIP6 Home Agent or DNS.  In a MANET
   scenario, a more distributed approach can be used, using multicast
   service advertisements.

   New mobility solutions for this hosts in ad hoc networks can be
   developed, if needed.
