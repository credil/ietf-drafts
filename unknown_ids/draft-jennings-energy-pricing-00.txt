              Communication of Energy Pricing Information
                    draft-jennings-energy-pricing-00

Abstract

   This specification defines media types for representing the future
   price of energy in JSON.  It also defines a way for a client device,
   such as an electric car, to discover a web server that can provide
   the future pricing for local electrical energy.  This will allow the
   client device to make intelligent decisions about when to use energy.

   This draft is a very early skeleton of a draft to start discussion
   around this idea.

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-

1.  Overview

   Many uses of energy can be shifted in time.  Consider charging an
   electric car.  When the users plugs in a car at 9pm, they may not
   care when it actually charges, as long as it is ready at 8AM when
   they need to go to work.  This is a classic real time problem and can
   be optimized as long as the charger for the car has relevant
   information about how long it will take to charge and the cost of
   electricity between the current time and the time when the task needs
   to be complete.

   This specification defines a simple JSON[RFC4627]media type to
   provide the cost of energy at future points of time.  It is an array
   of objects in which each object contains the time a new price will
   come into effect and the price at that time.  JSON also defines a
   well known URL on a web server so that an HTTP client can retrieve
   this data.  Finally as a way to automatically discover the web
   server, this specification defines a DHCP option to provide the host
   name of the web server.

   Consider a typical residence with broadband internet and a
   residential gateway that gets its IP address via DHCP from the
   service provider.  The service provider would provide the domain of
   the local power provider via DHCP.  The residential gateway would get
   this and provide it in DHCP requests sent to the residential gateway.
   The residential gateway would also be able to override this, so if
   the consumer had arranged power from an alternative power provider,
   the name of that provider could be configured in the device.

   A device on the residential network, such as a dishwasher, could find
   the energy provider name via DHCP.  The dishwasher would then make an
   HTTP GET request to the well known URI defined in this specification.
   In other words, it would do an HTTP GET to the /.well_known/
   energy-price.json and would receive back an energyprice+json media
   type.  For example

   {
   "currency" : "USD",
   "prices":[
       { "time": "2011-04-12T23:20:00.00Z", "price": "0.028" },
       { "time": "2011-04-12T23:21:00.00Z", "price": "0.025" },
       { "time": "2011-04-12T23:22:00.00Z", "price": "0.021" }
   ]}

   The above example shows a case where at 21:00 UTC, the price falls
   from 2.8 cents per KWh to 2.5 cents per KWh.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Semantics

   Each media type carries a single JSON object that represents a set of
   prices and times.  This object contains optional attributes described
   below and a mandatory array of one or more measurements.

   validTill:  Time at which this data will become invalid.  UTC time in
      RFC 3339 format.
   currency:  Optional.  Specify currency in ISO 4217 [REF] currency
      code.
   prices:  Array of price change objects.  Mandatory and there must be
      at least one object in the array.  Objects MUST be ordered in this
      array by time.

   Each price time object contains several attributes, some of which are
   optional and some of which are mandatory.

   time:  Time this price becomes effective.  UTC time in RFC 3339
      format.
   price:  Price per KWh starting.  The cost of energy changes to this
      price at the time in this object and remains at this price until
      the time of the next object in the prices array.

   Open Issue:  What is the best representation for time?

   Open Issue:  Is it OK that currency is optional?

   Open Issue:  How many entries can the array have?  It would be nice
   to have some maximum size.


4.  Well Known URL

   A client that implements this specification uses the path "//.well-
   known/energy-price.json" for the resource name unless the client has
   been configured with an alternative path.

5.  DHCP

   Open Issues:  Is DHCP the best approach to discovery or would
   something else be better?


6.  IANA Considerations

   Note to RFC Editor:  Please replace all occurrences of "RFC-AAAA"
   with the RFC number of this specification.

6.1.  Well-Known URI Registration

   IANA will make the following "Well Known URI" registration as
   described in RFC 5785:

           +----------------------------+----------------------+
           | URI suffix:                | energy-price.json    |
           | Change controller:         | IETF <iesg@ietf.org> |
           | Specification document(s): | [RFC-AAAA]           |
           | Related information:       | None                 |
           +----------------------------+----------------------+

6.2.  DHCP Options

   TBD

6.3.  Media Type Registration

   The following registrations are done following the procedure
   specified in [RFC4288] and [RFC3023].

   Note to RFC Editor:  Please replace all occurrences of "RFC-AAAA"
   with the RFC number of this specification.

6.3.1.  energyprice+json Media Type Registration

   TBD


7.  Security Considerations

   TBD

   Further discussion of security proprieties for media types can be
   found in Section 6.3.
