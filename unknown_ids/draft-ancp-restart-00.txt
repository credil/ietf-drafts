Internet-Draft           Graceful ANCP restarts             October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This draft describes a set of mechanisms to optimize the detection of
   ANCP adjacency loss, the re-establishment of an ANCP adjacency and
   the recovery of the associated ANCP information.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Problem Statement

   The ANCP base protocol, defined in[draft-ietf-ancp-protocol-06.txt],
   does not currently describe in any detail a mechanisms for detecting
   and recovering from the loss of an ANCP adjacency between the AN and
   the NAS.

2.1.  Detecting the loss of ANCP adjacency

   The ANCP protocol currently relies on a keep-alive timer for
   detecting the loss of an adjacency.  Since the keep-alive timer
   defaults to 30 seconds and the adjacency loss is triggered over a
   period spanning multiple times of the keep-alive timer, the achieved
   detection time is much longer than the time to detect the failure or
   closure of the TCP transport connection used by ANCP.  If instead (or
   in addition to) the failure or closure of the underlying TCP
   connection is used as trigger for loss of ANCP adjacency, the ANCP
   reaction time can be much shorter.  Therefore, we recommend that the
   state of the underlying TCP connection be used as a trigger for loss
   of ANCP adjacency.

2.2.  Loss of topological information

   As per the behavior currently specified in the ANCP base protocol
   [draft-ancp], the AN sends topology information through Port-Up
   messages to a NAS after an adjacency is established.  Such messages
   are however understood to be sent only for ports that actively change
   state, in terms of their modem train rate or operational status,
   after the establishment of the ANCP adjacency.  In the event that the
   NAS looses topology information state (e.g due to a reload), or that
   the topology changes occur during the time the ANCP adjacency is
   down, this will result in the NAS holding an inaccurate view of the
   topological information and unable to apply the desired policies.
   Currently, ANCP does not provide for a mechanism by which the NAS can
   recover from this situation.

2.3.  Loss of multicast information

   The ANCP multicast extensions draft
   [draft-ietf-ancp-mc-extensions-00.txt] describes a number of ANCP
   messages used for the control, authorization and reporting of
   multicast traffic on the AN.  The loss of an ANCP adjacency, is also
   likely to lead to an inconsistency in the multicast information
   shared by the NAS and AN in the event that any of the devices lost or
   changed multicast information state during that time.  More
   specifically, any multicast replication membership state that has
   been installed via ANCP may no longer be valid after the ANCP
   adjacency is recovered.  This may be due to either the AN or NAS
   resetting or changes of policy during the time the ANCP adjacency is
   down.  This issue also clearly affects the correct operation of the
   system, likely leading to incorrect policy decisions and also
   multicast replication state.


3.  Proposed solutions

3.1.  Speeding up the detection of ANCP Adjacency loss

   Based on the inherent binding of ANCP to the TCP transport, by using
   the TCP socket state it is possible for the AN to detect a failure in
   transport of the ANCP adjacency before the ANCP keepalive timer
   expires.  As such we propose that ANCP implementations monitor the
   TCP socket state and on detecting an active ANCP transport socket
   transitioning to the CLOSED state they reset the ANCP adjacency state
   for the node corresponding to the TCP socket.  The following figure
   shows an exemplary sequence of events along with TCP socket states.

                                 Figure 1

   Following the AN reaching the CLOSED TCP socket state, the
   corresponding ANCP adjacency is to be reset by the AN and an attempt
   to re- establish the TCP connection initiated.  In other words, the
   CLOSED TCP socket state is to be interpreted as an ANCP link down
   event.

3.2.  Recovering topological information

   In order to minimize the need for protocol changes, including new
   capabilities, we propose the following solution.  Each time ANCP
   establishes or re-establishes an adjacency, the AN should MUST send
   Port-Up messages for all ports that are currently active on the AN.

                             Initial Port_UP messages
                         (Derived from all active ports)

                                 Figure 2

   The above behavior of the AN is proposed to be mandated as part of
   the ANCP protocol specification.

3.3.  Multicast use case

   When ANCP adjacency goes down due to NAS restarts, NAS is no longer
   synchronized with AN multicast membership.  Reconciling multicast
   information consistency is a bit more complicated due to the fact
   that both the AN and NAS are in their own ways producers and
   consumers of such information.  (Here we are not describing the case
   when AN itself restarts, that is TBD) In terms of reconciling active
   multicast group membership on the AN, we propose that upon the re-
   establishment of the ANCP adjacency, the NAS issues an all port
   Multicast flow report query to the AN to obtain a picture of the
   multicast flow membership state present on the AN.  Based on the then
   received multicast flow report the NAS would, when configured to do
   so, re-run any conditional access policy checks in order to determine
   whether the reported flows are still in line with the active
   policies.  For any flows that are found to be in violation of such
   policies, the NAS would then issue a Multicast-Replication-Ctrl
   message requesting the deletion of the flow by the AN.  This
   reconciliation process is illustrated in Figure 3 and does not appear
   to require protocol modifications beyond what is specified in
   [draft-ietf-ancp-mc-extensions-00.txt].

            (*) NAS performs a conditional access and admission
            control checks. If flow reported is no longer allowed
            for target then NAS send a Multicast-Replication-Crl
            delete message to AN (Flow 1 in figure 3).

   Based on the above description the following functional requirement
   may be laid down to describe the expected NAS and AN behaviors:
   Following the establishment or re-establishment of an ANCP adjacency
   with transactional multicast capability, the NAS MUST issue a
   Multicast Flow Report request message requesting the status for all
   ports.  Upon receiving the multicast flow report response from the
   AN, NAS MUST perform a conditional access check on the reported
   multicast flows and use the outcome to drive an flow deletion
   requests by means of Multicast Replication Control messages (0x01).


4.  Sections TBD

   The following procedures are still to be described: 1.  The case when
   AN has the Multicast Bandwidth Delegation control enabled, and either
   NAS or AN restarts (or ANCP adjacency restarts). 2.  The Multicast
   reconciliation procedure presented in this document applies to NAS
   restarts only; it doesn't cover the case where AN restarts.
