<abstract>
<t>
A Domain Name System (DNS) resource record which provides status
information about a zone is described in this document. 
</t>

</abstract>

<middle>

<section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
14, <xref target="refs.RFC2119">RFC2119</xref>.
</t> 
</section>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>
The DNS protocol is defined in
RFC1034<xref target="refs.RFC1034"></xref>,
RFC1035<xref target="refs.RFC1035"></xref> and clarified in
RFC2181<xref target="refs.RFC2181"></xref>. 
The DNS does not currently provide a well defined mechanism for
obtaining information about the status of a zone: what it is being
used for, the significance of the zone's contents, when the zone was
last updated and so on.
This means a variety of ad-hoc techniques are deployed whenever zone
administrators choose to make this information available.
Typical strategies include descriptive TXT records in the zone or
embedding meta-information in the values of existing RRtypes or
subtypes such as the SOA record's serial number and RNAME.
These are confusing and impractical since an arbitrary DNS client
needs a priori knowledge of which of these schemes, if any, has been
used by a zone administrator.
</t>

<t>
This document advocates the introduction of a new
resource record specifically to provide this type of information.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="Rationale" title="Rationale">
<t>
Common examples where indicating the status of a zone would
be useful include: whenever the domain is in the process of
a substantial update; a domain undergoing a long-term
migration; and changes to the authoritative name servers for a
zone. eg "Use of example.net was deprecated on April 1st.
Please visit example.com instead." It would be convenient to
store this type of meta information within the zone in a way
that makes it easily retrieved.
This kind of status information would be particularly helpful for
systems such as ENUM <xref target="refs.RFC3761"></xref> which can be
used for publishing real-time contact data for zone owners.
</t>
	  
<t>
These sorts of details are generally associated with the
administration of the zone rather than being tied to the rest of the
zone content.
Clarifying this separation between information that reflects the
status of a zone from any text that a domain holder may choose to
publish via DNS is useful.
It also avoids the current subtyping issues that would affect
processing of a TXT RRset if the status information was embedded
there.
TXT records are too general and would require imprecise RDATA parsing
in order to extract any relevant items of interest to a particular
client.
</t>

<t>
The proposed RRtype will be of particular use for zones where contact
data are published in the DNS as NAPTR
records <xref target="refs.RFC3403"></xref>. 
For instance a set of tel: and sip: URIs
<xref target="refs.RFC3986"></xref>. 
could be associated with the proposed zone status RRtype.
That could indicate these URIs are the ones published by the zone
owner when they are at work, or while travelling or when at home.
Client software could lookup the zone's ZS records and display a
meaningful message to the end user about the NAPTR records that had
been retrieved from an earlier lookup.
A description of which contact data the zone owner has published would
offer additional information to what might be inferred from the actual
NAPTR RRset or other zone data itself.
The ZS RRtype could express concepts like "the zone owner is asleep,
so don't bother trying voice-based communication" or "the zone owner
is at work but in a meeting".
</t>

<t>
Publishing and obtaining this information will become more significant
because of emerging applications and services which make innovative
use of the DNS such as the real-time manipulation of zone content
data.
For example, updating NAPTR records (ie the zone owner's contact data)
whenever the zone owner switches between the NAPTR RRset they publish
while at work, at home, commuting or while sleeping.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="NewRRtype" title="Justification For New RRtype">

<t>
TXT records are unsuitable for providing this sort of zone status
information because the semantics of TXT record RDATA are
unstructured.
TXT records can and are used for all sorts of purposes: version
control strings, comments or reminders to zone administrators,
anti-spam information, references to ticketing systems, contact
details of the zone administrator and so on.
It would be impractical for an application to interpret the contents
of a response to a TXT query and guess which, if any, of the returned
TXT records contained meaningful data about the status of the zone.
</t>
<t>
One approach would be to adopt a convention that a "magic string" in
the RDATA for some TXT record identified zone status information.
This is not viable for two reasons.
First, it may break backwards compatibility with the installed base
which might already be using this "magic string" in TXT records. 
The second reason is this proposal would introduce yet another example
of subtyping which is generally accepted as poor protocol design.
</t>
<t>
Likewise, it is not sensible to insert TXT records in some
part of the name space to be dedicated for this specific
purpose.
That would be another instance of bad protocol design because a
fundamental but unstated principle of the Domain Name System is any
RRtype can be used in any zone irrespective of the name of the zone.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="ZSResourceRecord" title="ZS Resource Record">

<t>
Apart from its type code, the wire and text formats for the
proposed ZS RRtype are identical to the definitions of the TXT
record given in RFC1035:
</t>

<figure>
<preamble>
ZS RDATA format
</preamble>
<artwork>
	    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
	    /                   ZS-DATA                    /
	    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
</artwork>

<postamble>
where:
    ZS-DATA        One or more character-strings.
</postamble>
</figure>
<t>
The ZS RRtype will hold descriptive text intended to
contain information reflecting the status of the zone in
which it is held.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="EndUserIssues" title="End User Considerations">

<t>
Users publishing ZS records SHOULD pay attention to the needs of
potential readers of these resource records, especially with respect
to character sets and language.
Although arbitrary text can be used in character-strings, publishers
of ZS records should realise that clients looking up these records may
not be able to display them if they are presented in unusual character
sets.
For example, a mobile phone or other hand-held device may not have the
font information or rendering capabilities to display (say) Chinese or
Arabic characters.
Similarly, publishers of ZS records should try to avoid displaying
information in multiple languages or assume that all readers of these
records understand the same language they have chosen to use.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="Sec-Cons" title="Security Considerations">

<t>
Although this document does not appear to introduce any extra security
issues beyond those listed in the thorough analysis of the threats to DNS in
<xref target="refs.RFC3833">RFC3833</xref>, there are some additional
considerations. These are described below.
</t>
<t>
It is unrealistic to assume that zone owners who publish ZS records can
be relied upon to ensure any ZS records contain accurate, timely
information.
Similarly it cannot be assumed that ZS records contain text that will
be understandable by an arbitrary reader that looks them up in the DNS.
Therefore any data contained in a ZS record is solely for
informational purposes.
The information contained in a ZS record MUST NOT be relied upon for
any location-based services.
In particular, emergency services MUST NOT not treat the contents of
a ZS record as definitive information about the location or
disposition of the domain name owner.

</t>
</section>

<section anchor="IANACons" title="IANA Considerations">

<t>
IANA is requested to issue a new type code and mnemonic for the
proposed resource record.
No other IANA services are required by this document.

document and for helping to identify potential uses for the proposed
record type.
