1.  Introduction

   Current networks make extensive use of multiple network paths to
   create larger virtual links between network elements, in particular
   when a single physical-layer link has exceeded its carrying capacity
   and no larger bandwidth physical layer technologies exist.  Operators
   use various link bundling techniques, such as Link Aggregation Groups
   (LAGs) and IP and MPLS Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP), to augment the
   capacity between network elements when physical link-layer capacity
   is exhausted.  Existing troubleshooting tools, based on 'legacy' ping
   and traceroute, are insufficient to effectively examine the
   underlying component-links that traffic will use.

   In addition, as more of the world's traffic converges around IP and
   MPLS based networks, service providers need to extract temporally
   aware traffic performance information.

2.  Background

   The use of Link Aggregate Groups (LAG's), Equal Cost Multi-Path
   (ECMP) or a combination of ECMP over LAG's is a common technique used
   to bond multiple parallel circuits or paths together to achieve the
   appearance of a larger aggregate link between two nodes.  The
   advantage of these techniques, in particular LAG's, is a reduced
   number of routing and signaling protocol adjacencies between devices,
   reducing control plane processing overhead.  A disadvantage of these
   techniques is an inability to determine the individual component-link
   used for traffic forwarding inside a LAG or ECMP path, specifically
   for a given microflow, between two devices using traditional
   traceroute or ping utilities.

   A key problem related to LAG or ECMP paths is, due to inefficiencies
   in LAG or ECMP load-distribution algorithms, a particular component-
   link may experience congestion or a soft-failure, which would go
   unnoticed by NMS systems and, likely, IP/MPLS Control Plane
   protocols.  The end result is performance degradation of a subset of
   end-user microflows that use the affected component-links between two
   adjacent devices.

   What is needed by operators are the following.  First, and the most
   immediate need, is a capability to determine the set of component-

   links used by individual network elements through which traceroute or
   ping messages are traversing.  Second, a capability to specify an
   end-user's microflow, e.g.: a 5-tuple "flow" in the case of IP
   traffic, that will be used by intermediate devices to calculate the
   component-link or ECMP path used for that flow to allow periodic or
   perpetual performance monitoring.  Ultimately, these capabilities are
   necessary to both determine and exercise the actual path that is/was
   used by an end-user's particular application through the network.


3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Types of Exercise Mechanisms

   This memo classifies two types of ping and traceroute requests that
   are needed in modern networks where many inter-node links consist of
   LAG, ECMP or LAG over ECMP paths.  First, a "traditional" or "legacy"
   traceroute and ping request where intermediate devices only
   understand how to use outer IP header information as the input to a
   LAG or ECMP hashing algorithm.  This type of mechanism has limited
   utility insomuch as existing devices, interior to a Service
   Provider's network, only understand how to process limited
   information in traceroute or ping requests.  Note that when operators
   originate traceroute and/or ping sessions from within their network,
   requests are sourced from devices, often routers, whose interfaces
   reside within their network.

   On the other hand, a "next-generation" traceroute and ping request
   where intermediate devices understand new information likely
   contained in the payload of the traceroute and ping request, which
   can then be fed as input to the LAG or ECMP hashing algorithm.  This
   would allow operators to, for example, specify the exact "tuple" used
   by customer traffic in order to properly exercise the LAG or ECMP
   paths used by a particular customer 'flow' through the network.

                 Figure 1: Traceroute through Routed Hops

   In the above example, the links A1-A2, B1-B2 and C1-C2 are grouped
   into a single LAG, called LAG-1, between nodes R1 and R2.
   Furthermore, D1-D2 and E1-E2 are grouped into a single LAG, called
   LAG-2, between nodes R2 and R3.  I1 represents the IPv4 address
   10.1.1.1/30 assigned to the LAG-1 interface on R1.  I2 represents the
   IPv4 address 10.1.1.2/30 assigned to the LAG-1 interface on R2.  I3
   and I4 are the IP interfaces assigned to R2 and R3, respectively, on
   LAG-2.  R1 and R2 will maintain a single set of routing and signaling
   protocol (e.g.: IS-IS, RSVP and/or LDP), adjacencies over LAG-1,
   while R2 and R3 will maintain a single set of routing and signaling
   protocol adjacencies over LAG-2.  Assuming the individual component
   link sizes between R1, R2 and R3 are 10 Gbps, the end result is that
   R1 and R2 believe they have a single 30 Gbps connection between them
   and R2 and R3 believe they have a 20 Gbps connection between them.

   When performing a traceroute from R1 through R2 to R3, each router
   independently and automatically determines, through a proprietary LAG
   or ECMP load-distribution algorithm, the outgoing component-link
   inside a LAG or ECMP path to send out traceroute UDP probe packets.
   Unfortunately, the details of the specific component-links are not
   exposed to a user interface, which would allow operators to determine
   the exact physical path used by traceroute.  Furthermore, those
   details cannot also be used as input to a 'ping' utility, (using ICMP
   echo-request and echo-reply messages [RFC792]), to test longer term
   performance of a specific physical path through the network.  The end
   result is a network operator may believe that a given path between
   devices is behaving properly when, in fact, end-user traffic is
   traversing a different set of component-links and experiencing
   congestion or other link-layer forwarding problems.

3.3.  Scenario 2: Traceroute through One Switched Hop

   |  R1  |         LAG-1         |  SW1  |-- D1 -- LAG-2 -- D2 --|  R2  |
   |      |-- B1 ----------- B2 --|       |-- E1 ----------- E2 --|      |

                                                        10.1.1.2/30: I2

               Figure 2: Traceroute through One Switched Hop

   In this scenario, links A1-A2 and B1-B2 are grouped into a single 20
   Gbps LAG, called LAG-1, between nodes R1 and SW1.  Furthermore, links
   C1-C2, D1-D2 and E1-E2 are also joined together into a single 30 Gbps
   LAG, called LAG-2, between nodes SW1 and R2.  I1 represents the IPv4
   address 10.1.1.1/30 assigned to the LAG-1 interface on R1.  I2
   represents the IPv4 address 10.1.1.2/30 assigned to the LAG-2
   interface on R2.  As in Scenario 1, R1 and R2 will maintain a single
   set of IP/MPLS routing and signaling protocol adjacencies over the
   LAG's through SW1.

   As in scenario 1, each device along the path R1 to SW1 to R2, (or
   vice-versa), automatically and independently determines the outgoing
   component-link inside a LAG or ECMP "bundle" to send out traceroute
   UDP probe packets.  Unfortunately, in this scenario if only the
   incoming component-link interface ID is displayed to an end-user or
   network operator, that will not reveal the entire physical path
   traversed from R1 through SW1 to R2.  This scenario highlights the
   need to also show both the outgoing component-link interface ID on R1
   and the incoming component-link interface ID on R2.  With both of
   those pieces of information, and a priori knowledge that there is
   only one Layer-2 switch between R1 and R3, an operator can rely on a
   "legacy" traceroute implementation to determine the actual component-
   links that were used in a traceroute request.

   If the operator does not have a priori knowledge that there is a
   Layer-2 switch between R1 and R2, it would be useful for R1 and R2 to
   include relevant Layer-2 information, learned from a Link-Layer
   Discovery Protocol, on both R1 and R3 in the traceroute reply.  In
   this example, R1 would reply with its own outgoing component-link
   name, SW1's hostname and SW1's incoming component-link name.
   Furthermore, when R2 sends a traceroute reply it would respond with
   its own incoming component-link name, SW1's hostname and SW1's
   outgoing component-link name.  This would immediately point out to an
   operator the presence of one, or more, Layer-2 switches in the middle
   of a Layer-3 path.  Ultimately, without specific component-link
   'neighbor' information, such as from a Link-Layer Discovery Protocol,
   it will be difficult to rapidly determine the presence or absence of
   Layer-2 switches in the interior of a Layer-3 path.

Internet-Draft             OAM-NG Requirements             February 2008


   It's also important to point out in this particular scenario that, at
   best, SW1 only understands how to parse information in the outer IP
   header of a legacy traceroute UDP probe, or other data packets, for
   input into its LAG hash algorithm, which ultimately determines the
   outgoing component-link it will use to send packets to R2.  It would
   be highly desirable that SW1 was able to intercept and act upon data
   fields contained in "next-generation" traceroute and/or ping probe
   packets, so that operators could specify the actual 5-tuple "flow" to
   be input into SW1's LAG hash algorithm in order to exercise a
   specific component-link on SW1 outbound toward R3.  If this approach
   is not used it would likely prevent operators from periodically or
   continuously exercising a specific set of component-links through a
   given edge-to-edge path on the network, such as through a proactive
   network monitoring system, as discussed in Section 4.1 of this
   document.

3.4.  Scenario 3: Traceroute through Two, or More, Switched Hops

         I1: 10.1.1.1/30

     | R1 |    LAG-1    | SW1 |    LAG-2    | SW2 |-F1- LAG-3 -F2-| R2 |
     |    |-B1-------B2-|     |-D1-------D2-|     |-G1---------G2-|    |
     +----+             +-----+             +-----+               +----+
                                                     10.1.1.2/30: I2

          Figure 3: Traceroute through Two, or More Switched Hops

   In this case, two Layer-2 switches are inserted in the path between
   Layer-3 nodes R1 and R2.  LAG-1 and LAG-2 are each grouped together
   into their own 20 Gbps LAG.  Furthermore, LAG-3, between nodes SW2
   and R2, is joined together as a single 30 Gbps LAG.  Finally, I1
   represents the IPv4 address 10.1.1.1/30 assigned to the LAG-1
   interface on R1; in addition, I2 denotes the IPv4 address 10.1.1.2/30
   assigned to the LAG-2 interface on R2.

   This scenario is common in Enterprise or DataCenter environments
   where R1 may be a router or server, SW1 a top-of-rack distribution
   switch, SW2 an aggregation switch and, finally, R2, which is a
   Layer-3 router typically providing WAN connectivity.

   This particular case further highlights the need to automatically
   learn the presence of Layer-2 switches and, ideally, allow one to
   automatically exercise their LAG hash algorithms to fully qualify the
   exact set of component-links taken between two Layer-3 devices.  In
   order to learn the presence of Layer-2 switches, it will be necessary
   for traceroute replies to also include relevant Layer-2 information,
   such as the next-hop device's hostname and incoming component-link

   name, from a Link-Layer Discovery Protocol.  In the case of "legacy"
   traceroute, R1 would reply with its outgoing component-link name,
   plus two pieces of information learned from a Link-Layer Discovery
   Protocol: SW1's hostname and SW1's incoming component-link name.
   Furthermore, when the next traceroute UDP probe is sent to R2, it
   will reply with it's incoming component-link name, SW2's hostname and
   SW2's outgoing component-link name.  Unfortunately, this only yields
   a partial solution, because it would not reveal the actual component-
   link used between SW1 and SW2, nor the presence of a third Layer-2
   switch between SW1 and SW2.  In this instance, an operator would want
   to use Layer-2 OAM tools in an attempt to identify and diagnose the
   particular component-link that is used between SW1 and SW2.
   Unfortunately, Layer-2 OAM tools do not have the ability to identify
   or troubleshoot component-links in a 802.3ad LAG.  In addition, it is
   time consuming for operators to stop using Layer-2.5 or Layer-3 ping/
   traceroute tools, login to R1 and R2 and use Layer-2 OAM tools to
   resume diagnosing the problem.  Furthermore, due to the lack of an
   integrated toolset, it prevents operators from using an NMS to
   continuously monitor component-links on paths that go over one or
   more Layer-2 switches.

   Instead, what is needed by operators is integrated Layer-2 and
   Layer-3 ping/traceroute tools, which allow for rapid and accurate
   diagnosis and troubleshooting of LAG/ECMP problems.  Ultimately, if
   Layer-2 switches can intercept and act upon "next-generation"
   traceroute and ping requests, that would enable operators to specify
   the actual 5-tuple "flow" to be input into each Layer-2 switches' LAG
   hash algorithm.  This would allow operators to periodically or
   continuously exercise a specific set of component-links over all
   Layer-2 and Layer-3 devices, all at the same time, along a complete
   edge-to-edge path through the network, as discussed in Section 4.1 of
   this document.

   It should be noted that the above presumes intermediate Layer-2
   switches are capable of intercepting and acting upon NG-OAM probe-
   requests, which may not be true initially in all environments.
   Therefore, this document requires all NG-OAM solutions to document
   how they will determine if intermediate Layer-2 switches are NG-OAM
   capable and communicating that back to the initiator of an NG-OAM
   request, in order that operators can tell if the complete path was
   properly exercised.

3.6.  Proxy Traceroute/Ping Functionality

   To enable more rapid troubleshooting and diagnosis of problems
   related to LAG, ECMP and/or asymmetric paths in a large-scale
   network, it is useful to use "proxy" routers/hosts within a network
   that can initiate a traceroute or ping on behalf of a Network
   Monitoring System (NMS), such as via [PROXY-LSP-PING].  This is
   particularly valuable in the following scenarios:

   o  When troubleshooting problems related to asymmetric paths, it is
      useful to perform a traceroute and/or ping from a source to the
      destination as well as from the destination back to the source.

   o  Some IP/MPLS routers use 'input interface' as input into the LAG
      and/or ECMP hashing algorithm; therefore, quickly exercising the
      associated direction of a particular flow through the network is
      required.

   o  When narrowing a problem down to specific sequence of links within
      the network, it is useful to rapidly focus additional testing on
      suspicious segments, which are a subset of an overall edge-to-edge
      path.

   o  Periodic monitoring of a large-scale network composed of a
      multitude of LAG and/or ECMP paths.  In order to divide up the
      periodic testing of a large set of component-links and paths while
      simultaneously providing timely results, it is useful to
      distribute testing out to the IP/MPLS routers in the network on or
      near the paths to be tested.  (See Section 3.6 for more details).

   In this scenario, there are three types of devices:

   Initiator: The node which creates a proxy traceroute/ping request
   with: 1) a "5-tuple" to be used as input to a LAG and/or ECMP hashing
   algorithm; 2) the IP address of the Proxy IP/MPLS router that will
   initiate the ping/traceroute on behalf of the Initiator; and, 3) the
   IP address of the destination IP/MPLS router/host that will terminate
   this ping/traceroute request.

   Proxy IP/MPLS Router: The node which receives a proxy traceroute/ping
   request from an Initiator.  Once it has interpreted the proxy
   request, it initiates a proxy ping/traceroute request from itself
   toward the destination IP/MPLS router specified in the proxy ping/
   traceroute request.

   Proxy Request Terminator: The node(s) which terminate a proxy
   traceroute/ping request received from the Proxy IP/MPLS Router.  In
   the case of a proxy traceroute, intermediate nodes along the path to



Amante, et al.           Expires August 21, 2008               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft             OAM-NG Requirements             February 2008


   the final destination of proxy traceroute are considered
   "Intermediate Proxy Request Terminators".

   A NG-OAM solution MUST support Proxy Traceroute/Ping Functionality.
   A NG-OAM solution MUST support replies from the Proxy Request
   Terminator (or Intermediate Proxy Request Terminators) being sent
   back to the Proxy IP/MPLS Router, before they are relayed back to the
   Initiator.  The advantage of this approach is that replies should
   follow a symmetrical path back to the Initiator, which is useful if
   the NMS is behind a stateful firewall.  On the other hand, an NG-OAM
   solution MAY support replies from the Proxy Request Terminator (or,
   Intermediate Proxy Request Terminators) directly back to the
   Initiator.  The advantage of this scheme is that it does not rely on
   the Proxy IP/MPLS Router to cache or relay/reformat Proxy Reply
   Information, before replying back to the Initiator.  This may be
   useful in situations where it's desirable to reduce the load on the
   Proxy IP/MPLS Router.


4.  Performance Monitoring

4.1.  Proactive Network Monitoring and Verification

   There are two forms of Proactive Network Monitoring and Verification
   (PNMV): Perpetual and Periodic.  In a Perpetual PNMV case, the nodes
   performing monitoring send OAM messages at a specific interval, and
   record the results on a perpetual basis.  In the Periodic case, the
   messages are sent only on demand of an external system, such as an
   NMS, or an operator's command.  These forms can be implementation
   cases of the same solution.

   Today's solutions, such as ping, traceroute, and simulated user
   traffic between management nodes, can address the case when there is
   a single path between two endpoints.  However, in large national and
   international networks, there will exist several routed hops for
   certain paths through the network.  Furthermore, between each pair of
   IP/MPLS routers there will exist LAG's and/or ECMP paths.
   Unfortunately at present, Network Monitoring Systems (NMS) are unable
   to exercise the set of component-links through specific paths on the
   network.  This would allow the NMS to identify and notify a Network
   Operations Center (NOC) to a soft-failure through one or more
   component-links on the network.  The NOC could then proactively
   respond to the problem by, for example, quickly taking the affected
   component-link(s) out-of-service or, alternatively, administratively
   disabling the link bundle or ECMP path and allowing traffic to switch
   to another in-service path.

   The challenge with monitoring a large set of LAG and/or ECMP paths in



Amante, et al.           Expires August 21, 2008               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft             OAM-NG Requirements             February 2008


   a network will be to find the right balance between monitoring all
   component-links in the network, minimizing the resource utilization
   (e.g.: CPU, memory, network I/O) on the NMS system(s) while
   simultaneously having a timely detection interval to allow for
   proactive notification of problems to the NOC.  Therefore, a solution
   must be devised that allows an NMS to transmit multiple independent,
   concurrent LAG and/or ECMP path test queries into various points in
   the network.  Within the network, Proxy IP/MPLS Routers will carry
   out the test queries and report back the test results to the NMS.

   A NG-OAM solution SHOULD support the ability to do Proactive
   Perpetual Network Monitoring and Verification, again through the use
   of Proxy Traceroute/Ping Functionality described in Section 3.5.  It
   should be noted that Perpetual PNMV may be more resource intensive on
   devices, which is why that requirement is relaxed compared to
   Periodic PNMV.

4.1.1.  Proactive Periodic Network Monitoring and Verification

   Periodic network monitoring is often done in response to a suspected
   network event, or done as a sampled case of Perpetual network
   monitoring when Perpetual network monitoring cannot be scaled to the
   necessary level.  Probes sent Periodically are often sent with a
   shorter inter-message interval, and often request more information
   than a test that runs on a Perpetual basis.

   In order to perform periodic monitoring, the Initiator MUST send the
   Proxy IP/MPLS Router, the number and interval of the probe requests.
   For example, the Initiator may send the Proxy IP/MPLS Router a
   request to run 300 consecutive probes at an interval of 500 msec
   between probes.

4.1.2.  Proactive Perpetual Network Monitoring and Verification

   Perpetual network monitoring is done consistently among a subset of
   end points in the total network.  The subset, such as sample PoP
   router to sample PoP router, is selected to strike a balance between
   a good view of network performance and an unmaintainable set of
   messages.

   In order to perform perpetual monitoring, the selected monitoring and
   monitored nodes must run the test, such as NG-Ping, at a set interval
   and collect and store the resulting statistics.

   Network Performance Monitoring, as described in section 3.7, is as
   good example of the case where Perpetual PNMV is required.

   An NG-OAM solution MUST offer the ability to change monitoring timing



Amante, et al.           Expires August 21, 2008               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft             OAM-NG Requirements             February 2008


   intervals.  Values as low as 3.3 ms have been suggested, but are
   optional.  Values down to 100 ms SHOULD be supported.

4.2.  Network Performance Monitoring

   Network Performance Monitoring (PM, or NPM) is the art and science of
   recording temporally aware network performance characteristics.  A
   use case for the resulting statistics is for SLA verification, in
   addition to proactive maintenance.

   Relevant PM characteristics are typically loss, latency and jitter.
   A PM solution MUST index these characteristics to time intervals.
   Knowing that 100 packets were lost, but not knowing when is not
   particularly actionable.  The limits of existing tools and
   information often results in a NOC "clearing counters" then running a
   "fast ping" for an arbitrary length of time and hoping that the error
   occurs again.  Keeping all results of a Perpetual PNMV test is one
   possible solution, however this volume of information can be
   difficult to store or to sort through when a network event is
   occurring.  A NG-OAM solution SHOULD provide easy-to-read,
   temporally-aware, statistic that allows an operator to easily assess
   the magnitude of the problem.

   An example of this sort of statistic from the world of SONET/SDH
   transport is the errored second, and severely errored second.  A
   limit to the SONET/SDH solution is that it is rare for SONET/SDH
   systems to have easy-to-read indications of when the ES and SES
   occurred.  If the system supports it, it requires looking through the
   log.

   The level of granularity of PM statistics gathering SHOULD be
   configurable.


5.  Other Requirements

5.1.  Intra-AS Requirements

   Intra-AS requirements are applicable within an Autonomous System
   (AS), where all IP/MPLS devices are expected to be under a single
   administrative authority.  Because devices are under a single
   administrative authority, copious diagnostic information that can be
   returned to the Initiator of a ping/traceroute request.  Ultimately,
   however, an NG-OAM solution MUST ensure that extensive Intra-AS
   diagnostic information is not leaked across the boundaries of the
   Autonomous System, since it would provide valuable network
   intelligence information.  In addition, it is desirable if
   lightweight authentication and/or encryption techniques can be used

   to secure both probe requests and replies, in order to limit the
   effects of resource exhaustion on network elements that are
   processing probe request/replies.

   The following is a brief summary of the minimal set of information
   that a NG-OAM solution is expected to address.  NG-OAM solutions MAY
   capture additional information through, for example, experimental or
   vendor-specific objects specified in the NG OAM probe-request.

   NG-OAM Probe Requests and Probe Replies MUST contain a "Query ID",
   generated by the Probe Initiator, that can be used to associate Probe
   Responses to Probe Requests.

   Next-Gen Traceroute

   o  MUST work for IP and MPLS

   o  MUST be able to specify a 5-tuple IPv4 or IPv6 "flow" in a Probe
      Request

   o  MUST be able to specify whether the IPv4 packet is a first-
      fragment, or subsequent fragment, in order that intermediate
      devices can adjust their LAG/ECMP calculation appropriately.

   o  MUST be able to specify the MPLS label stack use to identify a
      "flow" across an MPLS-only portion of the network in a Probe
      Request.

   o  MUST be able to specify the Layer-2, (e.g.: Ethernet), header used
      in a Probe Request.

   o  MUST be able to specify a combination of label stack and IP
      5-tuple, if both are used in the ECMP/LAG hash algorithm.

   o  MUST capture the following information in a Probe Reply:

      *  The specific components of Layer-2, (e.g.: Ethernet), header,
         MPLS label stack and/or IP 5-tuple, that were used in the ECMP/
         LAG hash algorithm at this hop

      *  Incoming Interface Name

      *  Outgoing Interface Name

      *  Number of component-links in a bundle

      *  Size (Bandwidth) of individual component-links in a bundle

      *  Percent bandwidth utilization on interface(s)

      *  Remote Link-Layer neighbor name and interface name

   o  SHOULD be able to, on request of the source, to provide recent
      performance history of the incoming or outgoing link(s)

   Next-Gen Ping

   o  MUST work for IP and MPLS

   o  MUST be able to specify a 5-tuple IPv4 or IPv6 "flow" in a Probe
      Request

   o  MUST be able to specify the MPLS label stack use to identify a
      "flow" across an MPLS-only portion of the network in a Probe
      Request.

   o  MUST be able to specify the Layer-2, (e.g.: Ethernet), header used
      in a Probe Request.

   o  MUST follow the regular data-plane path for forwarding within a
      network element

   o  MUST be able to test all links/paths concurrently, or serially,
      between two network elements when operators do not know a
      customer's "flow" information, which can be used as input to a LAG
      and/or ECMP hash calculation.

   Proxy Traceroute

   o  All of the requirements mentioned above for "Next-Gen Traceroute",
      plus:

      Requests.

   o  The Initiator MAY also specify the interval between Probe
      Requests, which the Proxy IP/MPLS Router is responsible for
      carrying out on the Initiator's behalf.

   Proxy Ping

   o  All of the requirements mentioned above for "Next-Gen Ping", plus:

   o  The Initiator MUST be able to specify the number of Probe Requests

Internet-Draft             OAM-NG Requirements             February 2008


   Next-Gen OAM Traceroute/Ping Probe Replies MUST capture error
   conditions that were encountered during an unsuccessful Probe
   Request.  Those replies are expected to capture not only those
   conditions defined by classic [ICMP], (e.g: Destination Unreachable
   Type), but also new error conditions specific to NG-OAM solutions.
   In order to seamlessly accommodate future error conditions, NG-OAM
   solutions MUST use a TLV format for specifying error conditions in
   Probe Replies.

   Intra-AS probe requests (and probe replies) MUST be easily
   identifiable in the data plane, in order that routers acting on NG-
   traceroute or NG-ping requests (or replies) can rapidly drop them in
   order to avoid resource exhaustion.  NG-traceroute and NG-ping
   solutions MUST provide configurable methods to rate-limit the number
   of Intra-AS request (or reply) packets to prevent resource
   exhaustion.

5.2.  Inter-AS Requirements

   Inter-AS requirements are applicable across administrative domains,
   such as the Internet or, perhaps, several MPLS service providers
   delivering a single MPLS VPN solution.  Because devices are not under
   a single administrative authority, only a limited amount of
   diagnostic information must be returned to the Initiator of a ping/
   traceroute request.  This information is primarily useful in the
   context of helping the responsible party pinpoint the specific
   location of a problem.  For example, Customer A may be experiencing
   packet loss in Service Provider A's network for his Internet service.
   The link between Customer A and Service Provider A consists of a ECMP
   path between SP A's ASBR and Customer A's ASBR.  Customer A can
   perform a NG-traceroute through this ECMP path and provide the output
   of NG-traceroute to SP A's NOC in order to more rapidly identify the
   particular component-link, which is the causing a problem.  Other
   examples where this is useful are: over Internet (IPv4 or IPv6)
   peering/transit links and within DataCenters from servers through to
   the DataCenter provider's ASBR attached to several SP's, where MPLS
   is not used.

   Inter-AS probe requests (and probe replies) MUST be easily
   identifiable in the data plane, in order that routers acting on NG-
   traceroute or NG-ping requests (or replies) can rapidly drop them in
   order to avoid resource exhaustion.  NG-traceroute and NG-ping
   solutions MUST provide configurable methods to rate-limit the number
   of Inter-AS request (or reply) packets to prevent resource
   exhaustion.

   o  MUST work for IP and MPLS

   o  MUST be able to specify a 5-tuple IPv4 or IPv6 "flow" in a Probe
      Request

   o  MUST be able to specify the MPLS label stack use to identify a
      "flow" across an MPLS-only portion of the network in a Probe
      Request.

   o  MUST be able to specify the Layer-2, (e.g.: Ethernet), header used
      in a Probe Request.

   o  MUST be able to specify a combination of label stack and IP
      5-tuple, if both are used in the ECMP/LAG hash algorithm.

   o  MUST capture the following information in a Probe Reply:

      *  Incoming Interface Name

      *  Outgoing Interface Name

   Next-Gen Ping

   o  MUST be able to specify the MPLS label stack use to identify a
      "flow" across an MPLS-only portion of the network in a Probe
      Request.

   o  MUST be able to specify the Layer-2, (e.g.: Ethernet), header used
      in a Probe Request.

   Proxy Ping/Traceroute requirements are not applicable to Inter-AS
   scenarios, since the risk of resource starvation is too large.

5.3.  MTU considerations

   Traceroute probes need to be kept to minimal size.  Traceroute reply
   PDU's should be kept to 1500 Bytes in size in order to avoid the need
   for IP fragmentation.  It is a safe assumption that operators have a
   minimum of 1500 Bytes for IP MTU, and often significantly larger.

   Optionally, path MTU discovery may be used to determine a minimum
   MTU.  The MTU values MUST be configurable by the operator to adjust
   to unanticipated conditions.  A Traceroute reply packet MAY span

Internet-Draft             OAM-NG Requirements             February 2008


   multiple packets.

5.4.  Extensibility

   It would be useful to allow for the "next-generation" traceroute and
   ping protocols to contain TLV's, in order that they may be easily
   extended in the future to account for additional capabilities, which
   may be developed at a later point in time.

5.5.  Path Capabilities

   In order to be certain that NG-ping or NG-traceroute will be able to
   properly exercise component-links in a LAG and/or ECMP path through
   the network, it is necessary to determine if all devices along a
   specific path are capable of supporting the requisite protocols and
   replying with appropriate results back to the originator of the NG-
   ping or NG-traceroute request.  There are potentially two methods
   that can be employed to determine these capabilities: 1) path
   discovery; or, 2) encoding special/reserved codepoints into the
   packet header of NG-OAM request/reply packets.  With the first
   method, the originating host/router could use a path discovery
   function to determine the capabilities and properties of intermediate
   and/or terminating devices prior to actually using NG-ping or NG-
   traceroute to test the data path.  Once the originating host/router
   has learned the characteristics of intermediate and/or terminating
   devices, it could then originate a NG-ping/traceroute request using
   that information to exercise the actual data path.

   The second method is likely to encode the NG OAM packets with
   specific values in the packet header of NG-OAM request/reply packets,
   (for example, via new ICMP type/codes or MPLS label values).  In this
   approach, the originating host/router can simply launch a NG-ping/
   traceroute request allowing each intermediate and/or terminating
   device to independently determine if it's capable of supporting the
   NG-OAM request and, concurrently, exercising the component-links
   appropriate to the LAG and/or ECMP path.

   Although the latter approach has the potential disadvantage that it
   may be more difficult to support on some existing hardware, this
   document recognizes that it is the superior approach of the two
   choices.  If one depends on, for example, NG-traceroute to "discover"
   characteristics of a path before allowing one to ping, it creates a
   circular dependency.  Specifically, in the case where one is doing
   perpetual pings and the underlying path changes for legitimate
   reasons, the NG-OAM would have to discover the change to the path,
   trigger a new NG-traceroute and then resume perpetual pings along the
   new path.  Note that a change to the existing path could consist of
   any of the following: 1) a component-link in a LAG goes down, yet,



Amante, et al.           Expires August 21, 2008               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft             OAM-NG Requirements             February 2008


   the LAG itself remains operational, (e.g.: a 10x LAG goes to a 9x
   LAG), ultimately changing the result of LAG hashing algorithm; or, 2)
   the entire LAG and/or ECMP path goes down and data packets are routed
   along an alternate path.  Ultimately, if each NG-OAM packet is a
   self-contained, autonomous OAM unit, then each intermediate and/or
   terminating device will act on it appropriately.

   Therefore, this document specifies that a NG-OAM solution MUST
   support the second method, autonomous OAM units, outlined above.  NG-
   OAM solutions MAY support the first method, to provide short-term NG
   OAM coverage with existing hardware.

5.6.  Per Hop Behavior Modification

   Modification of per-hop behavior in order to support NG-OAM is
   acceptable, but not required of NG-OAM solutions.  This allows
   solutions where intermediate routers have to look at something new to
   determine if they are looking at an OAM packet, or to determine if
   they are they target or Proxy of a NG-OAM request.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


7.  Security Considerations

   Devices MUST rate-limit the amount traceroute and/or ping traffic
   they process to avoid DoS attacks.  Those rate-limits MUST be
   configurable to suit the appropriate environment in which they are
   deployed.  An attacker must not be allowed to force an inordinate
   amount of traceroute and/or ping traffic down a single physical
   component-link causing congestion.  Therefore, devices MUST rate-
   limit the amount of "external" traceroute and/or ping traffic through
   any specific component-link or set of component-links.  Note,
   implementations SHOULD provide exceptions that to allow a network
   operators Intra-Domain traceroute and/or ping traffic, particularly
   for performance monitoring, to get through without interference by
