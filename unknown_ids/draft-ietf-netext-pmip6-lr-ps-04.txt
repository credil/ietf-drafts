               PMIPv6 Localized Routing Problem Statement
                  draft-ietf-netext-pmip6-lr-ps-04.txt

Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 is the IETF standard for network-based mobility
   management.  In Proxy Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes are topologically
   anchored at a Local Mobility Anchor, which forwards all data for
   registered mobile nodes.  The setup and maintenance of localized
   routing, which allows forwarding of data packets between mobile nodes
   and correspondent nodes directly without involvement of the Local
   Mobility Anchor in forwarding, is not considered.  This document
   describes the problem space of localized routing in Proxy Mobile
   IPv6.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF has specified Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] as the
   base protocol for network-based localized mobility management
   (NetLMM).  The scope of the base protocol covers the set up and
   maintenance of a forwarding tunnel between an MN's Mobile Access
   Gateway (MAG) and its selected Local Mobility Anchor (LMA).  Data
   packets will always traverse the MN's MAG and its LMA, irrespective
   of the location of the MN's remote communication endpoint.  Even
   though an MN may be attached to the same or a different MAG as its
   Correspondent Node (CN) within the same provider domain, packets
   being associated with their communication will traverse the MN's and
   the CN's LMA.

   The NetLMM Extensions (NetExt) Working Group has an objective to
   design a solution for localized routing in PMIPv6.  This includes the
   specification of protocol messages and associated protocol operation
   between PMIPv6 components to support the setup of a direct routing
   path for data packets between the MN's and the CN's MAG.  As a result
   of localized routing, these packets will be forwarded between the two
   associated MAGs without traversing the MN's and the CN's LMA(s).  In
   case one or both nodes hand over to a different MAG, the localized
   routing protocol maintains the localized routing path.  Relevant
   protocol interfaces may include the interface between associated
   MAGs, between a MAG and an LMA as well as between LMAs.

   This document analyzes and discusses the problem space of using
   always the default route through two communicating mobile nodes'
   local mobility anchors.  Furthermore, the problem space of enabling
   localized routing in PMIPv6 is analyzed and described, while
   different communication and mobility scenarios are taken into
   account.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology of [RFC5213].  The following terms
   are used in the context of this problem statement:

   o  Mobile Node (MN): Mobile Node without IP mobility support, which
      is attached to a Mobility Access Gateway (MAG) and registered with
      a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) according to the PMIPv6
      specification [RFC5213].

   o  Correspondent Node (CN): Correspondent Node according to its
      definition in [RFC3775] with or without IP mobility support.  The
      CN represents the communication peer of an MN, which is attached
      to a MAG and registered with an LMA according to the PMIPv6
      specification.

   o  Localized Routing: Result of signaling to set up routing states on
      relevant network entities to allow forwarding of data packets
      between an MN and a CN, which are attached to MAGs sharing the
      same provider domain, without intervention of the MN's LMA and the
      CN's LMA in data forwarding.

   o  Localized Routing States: Information for localized routing on
      relevant forwarding entities on the optimized data path between an
      MN and a CN.  Such information includes route entries and tunnel
      endpoints and may include further information about the MN and the
      CN, such as the communicating nodes' Mobile Node Identifier and
      their assigned Home Network Prefix.

3.  Problem Statement for Localized Routing in PMIPv6

3.1.  General observation

   The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol [RFC3775] has built-in mechanisms
   for direct communication between an MN and a CN.  Mechanisms for
   route optimization in MIPv6 cannot be directly applied in PMIPv6.
   Following the paradigm of PMIPv6, MNs are not involved in mobility
   signaling, hence cannot perform signaling to set up localized routes.
   Instead, the solution for localized routing must consider functions
   in the network to find out whether or not a localized route is to be
   used and then control the setup and maintenance of localized routing
   states accordingly without any assistance from the MN and the CN.  In
   case of communication between two nodes, which are attached to the
   PMIPv6 network infrastructure and each node is registered with an
   LMA, data packets between these two nodes will always traverse the
   responsible LMA(s).  At least some deployment would benefit from
   having such communication localized, rather than traverse the core
   network to the LMA(s).  In the context of this document, such
   localized communication comprises offloading traffic from LMAs and
   establish an optimized forwarding path between the two communication
   endpoints.

   Localized routing is understood in [RFC5213] as optimization of
   traffic between an MN and a CN under the same access router, whereas
   the MN connects to the MAG function of this access router and is
   registered with an LMA, but the CN is a regular IPv6 node without
   getting PMIPv6 service.  In such case, the MAG forwards traffic
   directly between the MN and the CN, assuming the MAG is enabled to
   support this feature (setting of the EnableMAGLocalRouting flag on
   the MAG) and the MN's LMA enforces this optimization.  [RFC5213] does
   not specify how an LMA can enforce optimization for such local
   communication.  Maintaining local forwarding between the MN and the
   regular IPv6 CN gets more complex in case the MN performs a handover
   to a different MAG.  Such use case is not considered in the
   specification and out of scope of this problem statement.  This
   document focuses on use cases, where both nodes, the MN and the CN,
   are each registered with an LMA and both obtain PMIPv6 mobility
   service.

   Localized routing is relevant at least for the following two reasons:
   First, by limiting the communication to the access nodes, the data
   traffic traversing the MAG - LMA path (network) can be reduced.  This
   is significant considering that the transport network between the
   access and the core is often the bottleneck in terms of costs and
   performance.  Second, there may be performance benefits for data
   flows between the MN and the CN in terms of delay and packet loss,
   especially when the MN and the CN are attached to the same MAG and



Liebsch, et al.           Expires July 16, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         PMIPv6 Localized Routing PS          January 2011


   the LMA is topologically far away from that MAG.  Even when the MN
   and the CN are attached to different MAGs, there could be benefit in
   limiting the communication to the access network only, rather than
   traversing the transport network to the LMA.  Hence, providing the
   necessary protocol specification to enable localized routing in
   PMIPv6 is strongly recommended.

3.2.  Use Cases Analysis

   This problem statement focuses on local communication between PMIPv6
   managed nodes being attached to MAGs sharing the same provider
   domain.  The following list analyzes different use cases, which
   consider the existence of multiple LMAs.  Figure 1 depicts a PMIPv6-
   based network with two mobility anchors.  According to [RFC5213], the
   MN moves in the PMIPv6 domain being built by its LMA and MAG.  The
   same applies to the CN, which moves in the PMIPv6 domain built by the
   CN's LMA and MAG.  The analysis takes no assumption on whether the MN
   and the CN share the same PMIPv6 domain or not.

   All use cases A assume that both the MN and the CN are registered
   with an LMA according to the PMIPv6 protocol.  Whereas MAG1 is always
   considered as the MN's current Proxy Care-of Address, the CN can be
   either connected to the same or a different MAG or LMA as the MN.
   Accordingly, these topological differences are denoted as follows:

   A[number of MAGs][number of LMAs]

   A11:  MN and CN (CN1) connect to the same MAG (MAG1) and are
      registered with the same LMA (LMA).  The common MAG may forward
      data packets between the MN and the CN directly without forwarding
      any packet to the LMA.

   A12:  MN and CN (CN1) connect to the same MAG (MAG1) and are
      registered with different LMAs (LMA1 and LMA2).  The common MAG
      may forward data packets between the MN and the CN directly
      without forwarding any packet to the LMAs.  Following the policy
      of [RFC5213] and enforcement of the setup of a localized
      forwarding path, potential problems exist in case LMA1 and LMA2
      differ in their policy to control the MAG.

   A21:  The CN (CN2) connects to a different MAG (MAG2) as the MN
      (MAG1), but MN and CN are registered with the same LMA (LMA1).
      The result of localized routing should be the existence of routing
      information at MAG1 and MAG2, which allows direct forwarding of
      packets between the MN's MAG1 and the CN's MAG2.  As LMA1 is the
      common anchor for MN and CN and maintains location information for
      both nodes, no major race condition and instability in updating
      the states for localized routing is expected.

   A22:  The CN (CN2) connects to a different MAG (MAG2) and a different
      LMA (LMA2) as the MN (MAG1, LMA1).  The result of localized
      routing should be the existence of routing information at MAG1 and
      MAG2, which allows direct forwarding of packets between the MN's
      MAG1 and the CN's MAG2.  As the location information of the CN and
      the MN is maintained at different LMAs, both LMAs need to be
      involved in the procedure to set up localized routing.  In case of
      a handover of the MN and/or the CN to a different MAG, not
      synchronized control of updating the states for localized routing
      may result in race conditions, superfluous signaling and packet
      loss.

   The following list summarizes general problems with setting up and
   maintaining localized routing between an MN and a CN.  In the context
   of this problem statement, the MN and the CN are always assumed to be
   registered at an LMA according to the PMIPv6 protocol [RFC5213].

   o  MNs do not participate in mobility management, hence cannot
      perform binding registration at a CN on their own.  Rather
      entities in the network infrastructure must take over the role of
      MNs to set up and maintain a direct route.  Accordingly, a
      solution for localized routing in PMIPv6 must specify protocol
      operation between relevant network components, such as between a
      MAG and an LMA, to enable localized routing for data traffic



Liebsch, et al.           Expires July 16, 2011                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         PMIPv6 Localized Routing PS          January 2011


      without traversing the MNs' LMA(s).

   o  In case the MN and the CN are both registered with different LMAs
      according to the PMIPv6 protocol, relevant information for the set
      up of a localized routing path, such as the current MAG of the MN
      and the CN, is distributed between these LMAs.  This may
      complicate the setup and stable maintenance of states enabling
      localized routing.

   o  In case localized routing between an MN and a CN has been
      successfully set up and both nodes move and attach to a new access
      router simultaneously, signaling the new location and maintenance
      of states for localized routing at relevant routers may run into a
      race condition situation.  This can happen in case coordination of
      signaling for localized routing and provisioning of relevant state
      information is distributed between different network entities,
      e.g. different LMAs.  In such case, as a result of MN's handover,
      updated information about the MN's location may arrive at the CN's
      previous MAG while CN moved already to a new MAG.  The same
      applies to the other direction, where the system may update MN's
      previous MAG about CN's new location while the MN has moved to a
      new MAG in the meantime.  The protocol solution must deal with
      such exceptional handover cases efficiently to avoid or resolve
      such problem.

3.3.  IPv4 consideration

   According to [RFC5844], the basic configuration requirements for
   supporting IPv4 in PMIPv6 are that LMAs and MAGs are both IPv4 and
   IPv6 enabled.  Also, LMAs and MAGs must have a globally unique IPv6
   address configured, irrespective of enabled support for IPv6 routing
   between these components.  This requirement should also apply to
   configuration requirements of localized routing.

   Additional issues emerge when localized routing is considered for
   PMIPv6 with IPv4 support.  These can be classified into two general
   groups, which are issues with localized routing between an MN's and a
   CN's IPv4 Home Addresses or transport plane issues.  The following
   subsections analyze these two groups.

3.3.1.  Localized Routing for communication between IPv4 Home Addresses

   In case an LMA and a MAG hold a registration to support IPv4 Home
   Address mobility for an MN, the MAG and the LMA must support
   appropriate encapsulation of IPv4 packets.  To enable localized
   routing, the MN's MAG must encapsulate and forward routing path
   optimized packets to the CN's MAG and needs to ensure, that the
   chosen encapsulation mode is supported by the correspondent MAG.



Liebsch, et al.           Expires July 16, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         PMIPv6 Localized Routing PS          January 2011


   Incompatibility in a selected encapsulation mode causes failure in
   setting up a localized route.

   When localized routing is used for IPv4 traffic, the conceptual data
   structures on associated MAGs must be augmented with appropriate
   parameters for forwarding localized traffic.  MAGs may need to
   maintain a routing state for each MN-CN-pair and make routing
   decisions for uplink traffic based on the packets' complete IPv4
   source and destination address.  Hence, conceptual data structures to
   handle states for localized routes need to comprise this address
   tuple for unique identification.

3.3.2.  IPv4 Transport Network Considerations

   The transport network between LMA and MAG may be based on IPv6 or
   IPv4.  Deployments may ensure that the same transport mechanism
   (i.e., IPv6 or IPv4) is used for operational consistency.  Similar to
   the encapsulation requirement stated in the previous section, the IP
   version used for localized routing is also assumed, by configuration,
   to be consistent across all MAGs within the associated provider
   domain.  The design of optional mechanisms for negotiating the IP
   version to use as well as the encapsulation mode to use are outside
   the scope of the NetExt WG's solution for localized routing.

4.  Functional Requirements for Localized Routing

   Several tasks need to be performed by the network infrastructure
   components before relevant information for such direct communication
   is discovered and associated states for localized routing can be set
   up.  The following list summarizes some key functions, which need to
   be performed by the PMIPv6 enabled network infrastructure to
   substitute mobile nodes in setting up a direct route.

   o  Detection of the possibility to perform localized routing.  This
      function includes looking at data packets' source and destination
      address.

   o  Initiation of a procedure, which sets up a localized routing path.

   o  Discovery of stateful entities (i.e. the LMA(s) and/or the
      MAG(s)), which maintain and can provide relevant information
      needed to set up a localized routing path.  Such information may
      include the routable address of an LMA or MAG, where one or both
      mobile nodes are connected to and registered with.

   o  Control in setting up and maintaining (e.g. during handover) the
      localized routing path.  Control is also needed to terminate the
      use of a localized routing path and to delete associated states,
      whereas a trigger for the termination may come from a non-PMIPv6
      related component.

Internet-Draft         PMIPv6 Localized Routing PS          January 2011


5.  Roaming Considerations

   Figure 2 shows PMIPv6 roaming cases where PMIPv6 components (e.g.,
   LMAs, MAGs) tied by MN and CN may be distributed between different
   provider domains (i.e., domain A, B, C) and MN and/or CN moves from
   one provider domain to another one.  In order to support localized
   routing when roaming occurs, it is required that MAGs to which MN and
   CN connect are within the same provider domain and each MAG has a
   security relationship with the corresponding LMA which maintains the
   registration of the MN or the CN, respectively.

   According to the roaming model as depicted in Figure 2, MN's PMIPv6
   domain is characterized by its MAG (MAG1/MAG1') and its LMA (LMA1),
   whereas CN's PMIPv6 domain is characterized by CN's MAG (MAG2/MAG2')
   and its LMA (LMA2/LMA2').  A solution for localized routing cannot
   take any assumption about whether or not MN and CN share the same
   PMIPv6 domain, hence MAG1/MAG1' may not share a security association
   with LMA2/LMA2' and MAG2/MAG2' may not share a security association
   with LMA1 respectively.

   It is not required that LMAs, which hold the registration for the MN
   and the CN respectively, are part of the same provider domain as the
   MAGs where MN and CN attach.  When MN's MAG and MN's LMA belong to
   different provider domains (A and C), localized routing is subject to
   policy governing the service level agreements between these domains.
   The same applies to the provider domains which provide CN's MAG and
   LMA.  Based on the above requirements, four PMIPv6 roaming and non-
   roaming cases can be taken into account.

   o  Case 1: MN's MAG (MAG1), CN's MAG (MAG2), MN's LMA (LMA1), CN's
      LMA (LMA2) are located in the same provider domain A.

   o  Case 2: MN's MAG (MAG1), CN's MAG (MAG2), MN's LMA (LMA1) are
      located in the same domain A while CN's LMA (LMA2') is located in
      provider domain B.

   o  Case 3: MN's MAG (MAG1'), CN's MAG (MAG2') are located in domain C
      while MN's LMA (LMA1) and CN's LMA (LMA2) are located in provider
      domain A.

   o  Case 4: MN's MAG (MAG1'), CN's MAG (MAG2') are located in provider
      domain C while MN's LMA (LMA1) is located in provider domain A,
      and CN's LMA (LMA2) is located in provider domain B.

   In these roaming cases, MN can be allowed to roam within its domain
   (e.g, MN's home domain in which MN's LMA is located) or over
   different domains (e.g., MN moves from its home domain to a visited
   domain).  CN should stay with MN within the same domain.

6.  Security Considerations

   Since network entities rather than MNs and CNs perform signaling to
   set up localized routing, the MIPv6 return routability test [RFC3775]
   is not suitable to authenticate associated signaling messages in
   PMIPv6.  Solutions for localized routing in PMIPv6 need to mitigate
   or to provide sufficient defense against possible security threats.
   When PMIPv6 participants are administered within the same domain,
   infrastructure-based authorization mechanisms, such as IPsec, may be
   usable to protect signaling for localized routing.

   Existing security associations according to [RFC5213] can be re-used
   to protect signaling for localized routing on the interface between a
   MAG and an LMA.  In case a protocol solution for localized routing in
   PMIPv6 relies on protocol operation between MAGs, means for
   protection of signaling between these MAGs must be provided.  The
   same applies for signaling on a possible protocol interface between
   two LMAs of the same domain.
