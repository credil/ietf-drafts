                draft-sarikaya-behave-mcast4nat64-03.txt

Abstract

   This memo specifies modifications required to NAT64 so that IPv6 only
   hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4 only servers.  The
   protocol is based on translating IPv4 multicast data before
   delivering it to the host in IPv6.  The protocol also allows IPv6
   only host to join IPv4 any source/ source specific multicast group in
   IPv6 using Multicast Listener Discovery protocol.

Internet-Draft             Multicast for NAT64                March 2011


1.  Introduction

   With IPv4 address depletion on the horizon, many techniques are being
   standardized for IPv6 migration including NAT64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].  NAT64 together with DNS64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] and the translation algorithm
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] enables IPv6-only hosts to communicate
   with IPv4-only servers.

   NAT64 currently supports only unicast communication
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful], [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate],
   [RFC6052].  With the advent of IPTV and Mobile IPTV, there is a need
   to provide support for multicast communication as well.

   The document continues in Section 3 with a set of requirements on a
   solution for NAT64 multicast support.  In Section 4 the architecture
   is presented.  Multicast translation protocol is explained in
   Section 5.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful], [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate],
   [RFC6052], [I-D.boucadair-behave-64-multicast-address-format],
   [RFC3810] and [RFC3376].


3.  Requirements

   This section states requirements on NAT64 translation protocol.

   The protocol MUST support IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast addresses as
   defined in [I-D.boucadair-behave-64-multicast-address-format].  The
   translation protocol MUST enable an IPv6 only host to join IPv4
   multicast groups where IPv6 only host identifies IPv4 groups using
   IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast addresses.

   Both any source multicast (ASM) and source specific multicast (SSM)
   MUST be supported.

   In IPv4 network, Protocol Independent Multicast routing MAY be
   supported.  In IPv4 network, Internet Group Management Protocol
   routing MAY be supported.

   User Datagram Protocol (UDP) MUST be supported.  Transmission Control
   Protocol (TCP) MAY be supported.

4.  Architecture

   We consider an IPv6 only host (Host 1, H1) that wishes to receive
   multicast data sent to IPv4 multicast groups, sent by an IPv4 only
   host (Host 2, H2).  Multicast data sent to an IPv4 multicast group
   such as 232.1.2.3 must be translated into an IPv6 multicast group
   data such as FF3E::232.1.2.3.  So a translator element is needed in
   the architecture.  The translator has to be connected simultaneously
   into IPv4 network and IPv6 network.

           Figure 1: Key elements of NAT64 Multicast Translator

   In order to receive multicast data, the host H1 must first subscribe
   to the multicast group of interest.  In IPv6 this is done using MLD
   protocol [RFC3810] by sending MLD Membership Report message
   indicating the group address which should have an IPv4 multicast
   group address embedded such as FF3E::232.1.2.3.  MLD entity has to
   communicate the group membership information to an entity that
   supports wide-area multicast routing protocol such as PIM [RFC3973],
   [RFC4601], [RFC5015].  PIM supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

   IPv4 group address in MLD membership Report message should be
   communicated to an entity that supports IGMP protocol [RFC3376].  So
   an IGMP Client is needed to handle joining and leaving IPv4 multicast
   groups by sending IGMPv3 Report messages to IPv4 network.  Once IGMP
   Client subscribes to an IPv4 multicast group, all IPv4 multicast
   packets can be received from the interface connected to IPv4 network.
   The translator translates such packets into IPv6 multicast data
   packets and forwards them to IPv6 network which delivers it to IPv6
   hosts that have joined the corresponding IPv6 multicast group.

   All the elements of NAT64 multicast translation system are shown in
   Figure 1.  Not shown in the figure are MLD Proxies which are located

   in Host 1's first hop router.  MLD Proxy optimizes MLD operation by
   providing only aggregate multicast group membership information to
   the upstream MLD router and duplicating multicast data at a place
   close to the hosts.

   Note that the architecture in Figure 1 is generic and does not
   prescribe any solution as to where in a real network the different
   components can be hosted or whether the architecture can be
   duplicated in the same network.  While in unicast communication
   multiple NAT64 boxes can be supported in an operator's network using
   multiple Pref64s, in multicast NAT64 the same does not hold because
   IPv6 only hosts do not send multicast data.  The elements in the
   architecture in Figure 1 are best placed in where the designated MLD
   router/ querier is hosted.  In broadband networks Broadband Network
   Gateway (BNG), in 3GPP networks Packet Data Network Gateway (P-GW)
   are the candidates for such a placement.  This implies that NAT64
   multicast translator may be hosted in a different network element
   than NAT64 unicast translator [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].


5.  NAT64 Multicast Operation

   In this section we specify how the host can receive IPv4 multicast
   data from IPv4-only content provider based on the architecture
   defined in Section 4.  The reverse translation of IPv6 multicast data
   for IPv4-only receivers is out of scope.  Multicast translation
   involves address translation defined in Section 5.1 and protocol
   (IPv4 to IPv6) translation defined in Section 5.2.

5.1.  Address Translation

   IPv6-only H1 will join IPv4 multicast group by sending MLD Membership
   Report message upstream towards the MLD entity in Figure 1.  H1 MUST
   use synthesized IPv6 address of IPv4 multicast group address using 64
   Multicast Address Format
   [I-D.boucadair-behave-64-multicast-address-format].  ASM_MPREFIX64
   for any source multicast groups and SSM_MPREFIX64 for source specific
   multicast groups are used.  Both are /96 prefixes.

   In both ASM_MPREFIX64 and SSM_MPREFIX64, M bit MUST be set to 1 to
   indicate that an IPv4 address is embedded in the last 32 bits of the
   multicast IPv6 address.  ASM_MPREFIX64 values are formed by setting
   flgs bits to make it an embedded RP prefix by setting R bit to 1 and
   P and T bits to 1 as shown in Figure 2 [RFC4291], [RFC3306],
   [RFC3956].

                     Figure 2: ASM_MPREFIX64 Formation

   Each translator is assigned a unique ASM_MPREFIX64 prefix.  The hosts
   can learn this value by means out of scope with this document.  With
   this, the host can easily create an IPv6 multicast address from the
   IPv4 group address a.b.c.d that it wants to join.

   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) can also be supported similar to the
   Any Source Multicast (ASM) described above.  In case of SSM, IPv4
   multicast addresses use 232.0.0.0/8 prefix.  IPv6 SSM_MPREFIX64
   values are formed by setting R bit to zero, P and T bits to 1.  This
   gives FF3x00008x::/96 as the SSM prefix.  This prefix is referred to
   as SSM_PREFIX64 Figure 3.

     |   8    |  4 |  4 |    16     |  4 |       60         |    32    |

     +--------+----+----+-----------+----+------------------+----------+

                     Figure 3: SSM_MPREFIX64 Formation

   Since SSM translation requires a unique address for each IPv4
   multicast source, an IPv6 unicast prefix must be configured to the
   translator to represent IPv4 sources.  This prefix is prepended to
   IPv4 source addresses in translated packets.

   The join message from the host for the group ASM_MPREFIX64:a.b.c.d or
   SSM_MPREFIX64:a.b.c.d or an aggregate join message will be received
   by MLD entity in the translator.  The translator as multicast anchor
   checks the group address and recognizes ASM_MPREFIX64 or
   SSM_MPREFIX64 prefix.  It next checks the last 32 bits is an IPv4
   multicast address in range 224/8 - 239/8.  If all checks succeed,
   IGMPv4 Client joins a.b.c.d using IGMP on its IPv4 interface.

   Joining IPv4 groups can also be done using PIM since PIM supports
   both IPv4 and IPv6.  The advantage of using PIM is that there is no
   need to enable IGMP support in neighboring IPv4 routers.  The
   advantage of using IGMP is that IGMP is a simpler protocol and it is
   supported by a wider range of routers.  The use of PIM or IGMP is
   left as an implementation choice.

5.2.  Protocol Translation

   Translator, after processing the addresses will then translate IPv4
   multicast data packet into an IPv6 multicast data packet.  The
   destination address is IPv6 group address ASM_MPREFIX64::a.b.c.d and
   source address is the translator's IPv6 interface address.  The value
   in Type of Service (TOS) field of IPv4 packet is copied into IPv6
   Traffic Class field.  IPv4 Protocol and TTL fields are copied into
   IPv6 Next Header and Hop Limit fields respectively.  IPv4 payload is
   copied into IPv6 payload.  UDP checksum is updated which completes
   the packet translation process [Thesis].  The packet is sent towards
   the host and on its way it may be duplicated for each member of this
   group and then sent to the individual host separately.

   Any IPv4 fragments sent by the routers must be translated into IPv6
   packets with IPv6 Fragment Header.  Fragmentation Offset field is
   copied into the corresponding field in the Fragment Header. 16-bit
   Identification field is copied into the low-order 16 bits of IPv6
   Fragment Header Identification field.  The high-order bits of the 32-
   bit IPv6 Fragment Header Identification field are set to zero.  More
   Fragments (MF) flag is copied to the corresponding field in IPv6
   Fragment Header [Thesis].

   Multicast translation described in this section is not specific to
   the hosts.  Translator gets the join message from the host and then
   updates the membership database.  Translator and any MLD Proxies
   downstream have to know all members of each IPv4 group so that they
   can correctly duplicate the data packets and deliver to the
   individual hosts.

   Also this prefix must be routed towards the translator on the IPv6
   network, to enable reverse path forwarding for multicast, and to
   inform other PIM routers about the correct destination for PIM (S,G)
   Join messages [Thesis].

5.2.1.  Differences with SIIT

   The Stateless IP/ICMP translation [RFC2765] is designed for unicast
   communication.  SIIT uses a different address translation than
   multicast address translation described Section 5.1.  However some
   parts of SIIT can be used in multicast translation.  In this section
   we describe the differences of SIIT with NAT64 translation.

   SIIT translates IPv4 packets into IPv6 using minimum MTU size of 1280
   bytes.  However in DVB-IPTV data streams, 1364 byte IPv6 packets need
   to be supported.  NAT64 translator must perform IPv6 path MTU
   discovery and set the MTU size accordingly, not necessarily always to
   1280 byte MTU size.  Note that IPv4 routers must not send ICMPv4

Internet-Draft             Multicast for NAT64                March 2011


   error message in response to a multicast packet [RFC1812] while in
   IPv6 this is not the case which enables path MTU discovery for
   multicast.  Path MTU values are kept in the translator for each
   multicast group.  However, for SSM, a different MTU value MUST be
   kept for each SSM channel.

   SIIT does not require transport layer checksum modifications because
   the prefixes used in SIIT are checksum neutral.  NAT64 translator
   must however modify the UDP checksum to replace the IPv4 addresses
   with the IPv6 source and destination addresses in the pseudo-header
   which consists of source address, destination address, protocol and
   UDP length fields before calculating the new checksum.

5.2.2.  PIM versus IGMP

   To handle joining and leaving IPv4 multicast groups, PIM client
   instead of IGMPv3 client as mentioned in Section 4 can be used.
   Since PIM does not support source filtering, if PIM is used then SSM
   can not be supported.  Even with IGMPv3, SSM support requires that
   all neighboring routers support IGMPv3.  If they support IGMPv1 or
   IGMPv2 the translator has to also support IGMPv1 or IGMPv2 for
   compatibility and as a result, SSM could not be supported.

   There are advantages of having PIM client at the translator.  PIM can
   communicate with neighboring IPv4 routers over flexible connections.
   The need to enable IGMP in the neighboring routers is removed if PIM
   is used.

   On the other hand, IGMP, being a simpler protocol than PIM, is more
   widely supported.  IGMP does not need to know the location of
   rendezvous points (RP) which makes it easier to configure the
   translator.


6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for IPv4 interface of the translator is
   similar to [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] and the
   considerations stated there apply.


7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
