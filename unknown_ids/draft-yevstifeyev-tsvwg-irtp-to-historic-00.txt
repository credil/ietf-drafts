1.  Introduction and Overview

   Internet Reliable Transaction Protocol (IRTP) is defined in RFC 938
   [RFC938].  This protocol has a number of issues, that make it
   impossible to be used in the current Internet.  Among other, the IRTP
   specification defined the protocol operations less than clear; the
   port range of 256 available ports is obviously very little; the
   protocol does provide neither security features nor congestion
   control, etc.  Moreover, for almost 25 years nobody has seen this
   protocol used in the Internet.

   Taking everything into account, development of a new IRTP
   specification would not be justified.  This document suggests IRTP to
   be moved to Historic status. [RFC2026]


2.  RFC Editor Considerations 

   RFC Editor is asked to mark RFC 938 [RFC938] as Historic (see
   [RFC2026]) and obsoleted by this document.


3.  IANA Considerations

   The document has no actions for IANA.


4.  Security Considerations

   The document does not introduce any new security issues to IRTP.
