Abstract 

   This document describes a Multi-Protocol Label Switching Transport 
   Profile (MPLS-TP) Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) 
   tool to propagate a client failure indication across an MPLS-TP 
   network in case the propagation of failure status in the client layer 
   is not supported as required in [RFC5860].

1. Introduction 

   In transport network OAM functionalities are important and 
   fundamental to ease operational complexity, enhance network 
   availability and meet service performance objectives by efficient and 
   automatic detection, handling, diagnosis and appropriate reporting of 
   defects and performance monitoring. 

   As defined in [RFC 5860] MPLS-TP OAM MUST provide a function to 
   enable the propagation, from edge to edge of an MPLS-TP network, of 
   information pertaining to a client (i.e., external to the MPLS-TP 
   network) defect or fault condition detected at an End Point of a PW 
   or LSP, if the client layer OAM functionality does not provide an 
   alarm notification/propagation functionality (e.g. not needed in the

Internet-Draft   Indication of Client Failure in MPLS-TP   February 2011 
    

   original application of the client signal, or the signal was 
   originally at the bottom of the layer stack and it was not expected 
   to be transported over a server layer), while such an indication is 
   needed by the downstream. 

   This document defines such a MPLS-TP OAM tool as Client Signal Fail 
   indication (CSF) to propagate client failures and their clearance 
   across a MPLS-TP domain. 

   According to [RFC 5921], MPLS-TP supports two native service 
   adaptation mechanisms via: 

   1) a PW, to emulate certain services, for example, Ethernet, Frame 
      Relay, or PPP / High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC). 

   2) an LSP, to provide adaptation for any native service traffic type 
      supported by [RFC3031] and [RFC3032]. Examples of such traffic 
      types include IP packets and MPLS-labeled packets (PW over LSP, or 
      IP over LSP). 

   As to the first adaptation mechanism via a PW, the mechanism of CSF 
   function to support propagation of client failure indication follows 
   [static-pw-status]. The PW status relevant to CSF function is AC 
   fault as defined in [RFC 4447] and [RFC 4446]. 

   As to the second adaptation mechanism via LSP, the mechanism is 
   detailed in this draft and is used in case the client of MPLS-TP can 
   not provide itself with such failure notification/propagation.

3. Mechanisms of CSF 

3.1. General 

   Client Signal Fail indication (CSF) provides a function to enable a 
   MEP to propagate a client failure indication to its peer MEP across a 
   MPLS-TP network in case the client service itself does not support 
   propagation of its failure status.  

   Packets with CSF information can be issued by a MEP, upon receiving 
   failure information from its client service. Detection rules for 
   client failure events are client-specific and are therefore outside 
   the scope of this document.

                         Figure 1 Use case of CSF 

   Figure 1 depicts a typical connection scenario between two client 
   network elements (Node A and Node D) interconnected through MPLS-TP 
   transport network. Client Node A connects to MPLS-TP Node B and 
   Client Node D connects to MPLS-TP Node C. Node B and C support MPLS-
   TP MEP function.

Internet-Draft   Indication of Client Failure in MPLS-TP   February 2011 
    

   If a failure is detected between Node A and Node B and is taken as a 
   native client failure condition, the MEP function in Node B will 
   initiate CSF signal and it will be sent to Node C through MPLS-TP 
   network. CSF signal will be extracted at Node C as an indication of 
   client signal failure. Further, this may be mapped back into native 
   client failure indication and regenerated towards client Node D. 

   Node B learns the failure between A and B either by direct detection 
   of signal fail (e.g. loss of signal) or by some fault indications 
   between A and B (e.g. RDI, AIS/FDI).  

   If the connection between Node A and B recovers, Node B may stop 
   sending CSF signals to Node C (implicit failure clearance mechanism) 
   or explicitly send failure clearance indication (e.g. by flags in CSF 
   PDU format) to Node C to help expedite clearance of native client 
   failure conditions. 

   Accordingly, Node C will clear client failure condition when a valid 
   client data frame is received and no CSF is received (implicit 
   failure clearance mechanism) or upon receiving explicit failure 
   clearance indication. 

3.2. Transmission of CSF 

   Upon learning signal failure condition of its client-layer the MEP 
   can immediately start transmitting periodic packets with CSF 
   information. A MEP continues to transmit periodic packets with CSF 
   information until the client-layer signal failure condition is 
   cleared. 

   The clearance of CSF condition can be communicated to the peer MEP 
   via: 

   - Stopping transmission of CSF signal but forwarding client data 
     frames, or 
   - Forwarding CSF PDU with clearance indication. 
    
   Transmission of packets with CSF information can be enabled or 
   disabled on a MEP. 

   Detection and clearance rules for CSF events are client and 
   application specific and outside the scope of this draft.

Internet-Draft   Indication of Client Failure in MPLS-TP   February 2011 
    

   The period of CSF generation is client and application specific and 
   outside the scope of this draft. 

3.3. Reception of CSF  

   Upon receiving a packet with CSF information a MEP either declares or 
   clears a client-layer signal fail condition according to the received 
   CSF information and propagates this as a signal fail indication to 
   its client-layer.  

3.4. Configuration of CSF  

   Specific configuration information required by a MEP to support CSF 
   transmission is the following: 

   CSF transmission period - this is application dependent. 

   PHB - identifies the per-hop behavior of packet with CSF information. 

   A MIP is transparent to packets with CSF information and therefore 
   does not require any information to support CSF functionality. 

4. Frame format of CSF 

   Figure 2 depicts the frame format of CSF. CSF PDUs are encapsulated 
   using the ACH, according to [RFC 5586]. GAL is used as an alert based 
   exception mechanism to differentiate CSF packets (with ACH as G-ACh 
   packets) from user-plane packets as defined in [RFC 5586].

5. Consequent actions 

   The primary intention of CSF is to transport a client signal fail 
   condition at the input of the MPLS-TP network to the output port of 
   the MPLS-TP network for clients that do not have alarm 
   notification/propagation mechanism defined. 

   Further, CSF allows creating a condition at the output port of the 
   MPLS-TP network such that the customer input port is able to detect 
   and alarm that there is no data arriving i.e. the connection is 
   interrupted. In this case, customers may choose another transport 
   network or another port to continue communication.  

6. Security Considerations 

    Malicious insertion of spurious CSF signals (e.g. DoS) is not quite 
    likely in a transport network since transport networks are usually 
    self-managed by operators and providers. 
      
7. IANA Considerations 

   This document requests that IANA allocates a new Associated Channel 
   Type for CSF function to be used in MPLS-TP OAM.
