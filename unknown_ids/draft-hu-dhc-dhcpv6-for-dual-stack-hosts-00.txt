Abstract

   A dual-stack host may wish to obtain IPv4 and/or IPv6 configuration
   settings via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).Network
   operators deploy seperate DHCPv4 servers and DHCPv6 servers,hosts get
   IPv4 parameters via DHCPv4 servers and IPv6 parameters via DHCPv6
   servers.  This document describes a solution,there is only a single
   intergrated DHCPv6 server deployed in the ISP network,hosts obtain
   both IPv4 and IPv6 configuration settings from this server.

Internet-Draft         DHCPV6 for dual-stack hosts              Feb 2011


1.  Introduction

   RFC4477 describes issues identified with dual IP version DHCP
   interactions and also promotes potential solutions to solve these
   issues.There are mainly two solutions:1/ seperate DHCP servers for
   IPv6 and IPv4; 2/ a single DHCPv6 server for both IPv6 and IPv4.  The
   second solution may be to modify DHCPv6 to be able to return IPv4
   information.This solution is hinted in the DHCPv6
   specification[RFC3315]:"If there is sufficient interest and
   demand,integration can be specified in a document that extends DHCPv6
   to carry IPv4 addresses and configuration information."  This
   solution may allow DHCP for IPv4 to be completely replaced by DHCPv6
   with additional IPv4 information options, for dual-stack nodes.

   This solution would avoid redundancy and simplify management for
   servers.  But as RFC4477 described,there are also a number of
   potential problems with this approach,the most important problem is:
   the IPv4 only nodes would not have any DHCP service available to
   them,DHCPv4 servers need to be configured anyway to support IPv4-only
   hosts.This problem also exists for the dual-stack hosts which can't
   obtain IPv4 information using DHCPv6,because the DHCPv6 client
   software on these hosts has not been modified and updated.

   This document will develop the solution in details,deploying single
   DHCPv6 sever which can serve for both IPv6/IPv4 hosts or dual-stack
   hosts.  The considered aspect of the solution include: host's
   implementation and behave/sever's implementation and behave/network's
   behave.

   In this document, we focus on the specific solution for operating
   DHCP in a mixed (typically dual-stack) IPv4 and IPv6 environment
   within a single administrative domain.

   In the isp network, a DHCPv6 server would be deployed to config both
   IPv4 and IPv6 parameters for hosts.  Dual-stack host can certainly
   obtain IPv6 settings using DHCPv6 protocol.If it wish to obtain IPv4
   settings,it send a DHCPv6 request message containning the new options
   designed for IPv4,and the server also return a DHCPv6 reply message
   containing the parameters which are requested.

   In this scenario,the dhcpv6 client software must be modified and
   updated to support that.

   modified and updated,the hosts can only send and receive DHCPv4
   messages to config IPv4 parameters.  But the server is DHCPv6
   only,can only process DHCPv6 messages,so the DHCPv4 message send by
   host should be translated to DHCPv6 message in somewhere and then
   send to server.Also, the DHCPv6 message replied by Server should be
   translated to DHCPv4 message and then returned to host.  The
   translation point may be CPE,Access Node or BRAS.


4.  Host's implementation and behavior

   There would be 3 types of dual stack hosts:

   Type 1:old type dual stack, having DHCPv4 client and DHCPv6
   client,the DHCPv6 client was not modified.

   Type 2:new type dual stack, having DHCPv4 client and DHCPv6
   client,the DHCPv6 client has been modified and updated.

   Type 3:DHCPv6 only client.

                  Figure 3: PROTOCOL STACK OF TYPE1 HOST

   Hosts of this type have not modified the DHCPv6 client software,so
   they can not obtain IPv4 settings using DHCPv6 protocolGBP[not]they
   can only use DHCPv4 protocol to get IPv4 parameters.

   Hosts of type 3 have only DHCPv6 client, they obtain both IPv6
   settings and IPv4 settings using the DHCPv6 only client.But this type
   is the future type, we will mainly disscuss the type 1 and type 2.

           Figure 6: CONCEPTIONAL IMPLEMENTAION MODEL OF SERVER

   The servers are DHCPv6 only,they can only process DHCPv6 messages,so
   a general DHCPv6 message process modual must be implemented.

   The servers must maintain both ipv6 and ipv4 settings for hosts,these
   settings may be:IPv6 prefixs which would be designated or
   allocated,IPv4 address pool,information about DNS, and so on.

   A Strategy Management Modual should be implemented to decide how to
   designate or allocate IP settings for hosts.There would be seperate
   strategy for IPv6 or IPv4,and also common strategy for both IPv6 and
   IPv4.

Internet-Draft         DHCPV6 for dual-stack hosts              Feb 2011


6.  Network's behavior

   If an ISP has deployed a DHCPv6 server in it's network,which would
   serve for dual stack hosts,and the hosts can be divided into Type 1
   and Type 2.

   Hosts of Type 1 would send DHCPv6 messages to request IPv6 parameters
   and send DHCPv4 messages to request IPv4 parameters,if the CPE in
   home network can't translate the DHCPv4 messages to DHCPv6 ones,the
   messages must be translated in the ISP network, may be in Access Node
   or BRAS.

   Consider a host of Type 2,how dose it know to request IPv4 settings
   using DHCPv4 or DHCPv6?  There are two possible solutions:1/the
   strategy been manually configured in host; 2/a mechanism for the ISP
   network to notify the host,like the mechanism using the M bit and O
   bit in RA message(RFC2461 section4.2).


7.  General Considerations and protocol translation

7.1.  New DHCPv6 Options for IPv4 Parameters

   In RFC3315 and other RFCs related to DHCPv6,many options have been
   defined to carry IPv6 information and parameters, but there are no
   DHCPv6 options been defined to carry IPv4 settings,so new DHCPv6
   options need be defined to carry IPv4 information such as IPv4
   address.

   The new options will be defined in other document.

7.2.  Protocol translation

   In Figure 2, the protocol translation was executed in CPE, in this
   section,we will disccuss the scenario where BRAS do the protocol
   translation.

                  Figure 7: PROTOCOL TRANSLATION IN BRAS

   The DHCPv4 messages send by hosts arrive at the BRAS device,then BRAS
   translates the DHCPv4 messages to DHCPv6 correspondent ones and send
   to the DHCPv6 server.

   The translation can also be executed in Access Node.


8.  Other Considerations

8.1.  Options for location identifing

   There are DHCP options defined to identify the remote connection of
   the circuit or used as a host identifier;these options are defined
   seperately for DHCPv6 and DHCPv4.For example:RFC3046 defined DHCPv4
   option 82(Relay Agent Imformation Option) and 2 suboptions(Agent

   Circuit ID Sub-option/Agent Remote ID Sub-option),RFC3993 defined a
   sub-option of option82(Subscriber-ID Suboption),while RFC4649 defined
   DHCPv6 option 37(Relay Agent Remote-ID Option) and RFC4580 defined
   DHCPv6 option 38(Relay Agent Subscriber-ID Option).

   These options are added by the DHCP relay agent and may be processed
   by DHCP server.When the DHCP protocol translation be executed, these
   options should be processed carefully.
