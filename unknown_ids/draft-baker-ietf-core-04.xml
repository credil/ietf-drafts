    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In the discussion of the Smart Grid, a question has arisen as to what
      the "core" protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite are. In this note, I
      will attempt to identify the structure of the Internet Protocol Suite
      and the key protocols that should be considered as critical in
      integrating Smart Grid devices into an IP-based infrastructure. In many
      cases, the protocols are options - one might choose, for example, TCP,
      SCTP, DCCP, or some other transport, or use UDP as a label and build the
      transport into the application itself. In the Transport layer,
      therefore, one is not limited to exactly one of those, nor is one
      required to implement them all. One should, however, pick the right one
      for the purpose one intends. This kind of discussion will be had at
      every layer.</t>

      <t>The set of protocols defined in this document focus on the use of the
      IP Protocol Suite in end systems, also known as hosts. In the Smart
      Grid, these end systems will be various devices such as power meters,
      sensors and actuators. These end systems can leverage infrastructure
      built on networking components using the IP Protocol Suite, which have
      well-proven implementations and deployments in the Internet.</t>

      <t>IETF participants in the Smart Grid discussion have been wary of the
      desire to write a "profile", repeatedly expressed. The IETF is all about
      interoperability, and in our experience attempts to "profile" protocols
      and architectures has resulted in a failure to interoperate. Examples of
      such failures abound. In IETF experience, writing a conforming and
      interoperable implementation of the right set of protocols works.
      Selecting some options and deselecting others within a defined protocol,
      however, is a dangerous course of action. So while this document is
      clearly a step in the direction of writing a "Smart Grid Profile", such
      a profile should in our opinion be a selected set of protocols, not of
      protocol subsets.</t>

      <t>For its own purposes, the IETF has written several documents that
      describe its expectations regarding implementations of the Internet
      Protocol Suite. These include: <list style="symbols">
          <t><xref target="RFC1122">Requirements for Internet Hosts -
          Communication Layers</xref>,</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC1123">Requirements for Internet Hosts -
          Application and Support</xref>,</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC1812">Requirements for IP Version 4
          Routers</xref>, and</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC4294">IPv6 Node Requirements</xref>,</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>At this writing, RFC 4294 is in the process of being updated, in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-node-req-bis"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document will read like an annotated list of RFCs. That is
      because that is what it is.</t>

    <section anchor="suite" title="The Internet Protocol Suite">
      <t>Before listing a list of protocols, it would be well to lay out how
      they relate to each other. In this section, we will discuss the layered
      architecture of the Internet Protocol Suite and the jobs of the various
      layers and their protocols.</t>

      <section anchor="architecture" title="Internet Protocol Layers">
        <t>The Internet Architecture uses the definitions and language of the
        ISO Open System Interconnect Reference Model, as shown in <xref
        target="iso-osi"></xref>. It actually predates that model, and as a
        result uses some different words - an "end system" is generally called
        a "host", and an "intermediate system" is more generally called an
        "internet gateway" or "router". But the fundamental concepts are
        essentially the same.</t>

        <section title="Application">
          <t>In implementation, the Application, Presentation, and Session
          layers are generally compressed into a single entity, which the IETF
          calls "the application". The SNMP protocol, for example, describes
          an application (a management application or a client that it
          communicates with) that encodes its data in a profile of ASN.1 (a
          presentation layer) and engages in a session to manage a network
          element. In the Internet, therefore, the distinction between these
          layers exists but is not generally highlighted. Note, in <xref
          target="irm"></xref>, that these are not necessarily cleanly
          layered: the fact that an application protocol encodes its data in
          some way and that it manages sessions in some way doesn't imply a
          hierarchy between those processes. Rather, the application views
          encoding, session management, and a variety of other services as a
          tool set that it uses while doing its work.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Transport">
          <t>The term "transport" is perhaps among the most confusing words in
          the communication architecture, because people with various
          backgrounds use it to refer to "the layer below that which I am
          interested in, which gets my data to my peer". In these contexts,
          optical fiber and other physical layers, the Internet Protocol or
          other networked protocols, and in some cases application layer
          protocols like HTTP are referred to as "the transport".</t>

          <t>In the Internet context, the "transport" is the lowest layer that
          travels end-to-end unmodified, and is responsible for end-to-end
          data delivery services. At minimum these include the ability to
          multiplex several applications on one IP address, and may also
          include the delivery of data (either as a stream of messages or a
          stream of bytes) in a stated sequence with stated expectations
          regarding delivery rate and loss. TCP, for example, will reduce rate
          to avoid loss, while DCCP accepts some level of loss if necessary to
          maintain timeliness.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Network">
          <t>The network layer is nominally that which identifies a remote
          destination and gets data to it. In connection-oriented networking,
          such as MPLS or ATM, a path (one of many "little tubes") is set up
          once, and data is delivered through it. In connectionless
          ("datagram") networks, which include Ethernet and IP among others,
          each datagram contains the addresses of both the source and
          destination devices, and the network is responsible to deliver
          it.</t>

          <section title="Internet Protocol">
            <t>IPv4 and IPv6, each of which is called the Internet Protocol,
            are connectionless ("datagram") architectures. They are designed
            as common elements that interconnect network elements across a
            network of lower layer networks. In addition to the basic service
            of identifying a datagram's source and destination, they offer
            services to fragment and reassemble datagrams when necessary,
            assist in diagnosis of network failures, and carry additional
            information necessary in special cases.</t>

            <t>The Internet Layer provides a uniform network abstraction or
            virtual network that hides the differences between different
            network technologies. This is the layer that allows diverse
            networks such as Ethernet, 802.15.4, etc. to be combined into a
            uniform IP network. New network technologies can be introduced
            into the IP Protocol Suite by defining how IP is carried over
            those technologies, leaving the other layers of the IP Protocol
            Suite and applications that use those protocol unchanged.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Lower layer networks">
            <t>The network layer is recursively subdivided as needed. For
            various reasons, IP may be carried in virtual private networks
            across more public networks using tunneling technologies like
            IP-in-IP or GRE, traffic engineered in circuit networks such as
            MPLS, GMPLS, or ATM, and distributed across local wireless (IEEE
            802.11, 802.15.4, or 802.16) and switched Ethernet (IEEE
            802.3).</t>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section title="Media layers: Physical and Link">
          <t>At the lowest layer of the architecture, we encode digital data
          in messages onto appropriate physical media. While the IETF
          specifies algorithms for carrying IPv4 and IPv6 on such media, it
          rarely actually defines the media - it happily uses specifications
          from IEEE, ITU, and other sources.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="security-issues" title="Security issues">
        <t>It is popular to complain about the security of the Internet; that
        said, solutions exist but are often left unused. As with automobile
        seat belts, they are of more value when actively used. Security
        designs attempt to mitigate a set of known threats at a specified
        cost; addressing security issues requires first a threat analysis and
        assessment and a set of mitigations appropriate to the threats. Since
        we have threats at every layer, we should expect to find mitigations
        at every layer.</t>

        <section title="Physical security ">
          <t>At the physical and data link layers, threats involve physical
          attacks on the network - the effects of backhoes, deterioration of
          physical media, and various kinds of environmental noise.
          Radio-based networks are subject to signal fade due to distance,
          interference, and environmental factors; it is widely noted that
          IEEE 802.15.4 networks frequently place a metal ground plate between
          the meter and the device that manages it. Fiber was at one time
          deployed because it was believed to be untappable; we have since
          learned to tap it by bending the fiber and collecting incidental
          light, and we have learned about backhoes. So now some installations
          encase fiber optic cable in a pressurized sheath, both to quickly
          identify the location of a cut and to make it more difficult to
          tap.</t>

          <t>While there are protocol behaviors that can detect certain
          classes of physical faults, such as keep-alive exchanges, physical
          security is generally not a protocol problem.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Session identification">
          <t>At the transport and application layers, and in lower layer
          networks where dynamic connectivity like ATM SVCs or "dial"
          connectivity is in use, there tend to be several different classes
          of authentication/authorization requirements. One must <list
              style="numbers">
              <t>Verify that the peers one exchanges data with are appropriate
              partners; this generally means knowing "who" they are and that
              they have a "need to know" or are trusted sources.</t>

              <t>Verify that information that appears to be from a trusted
              peer is in fact from that peer.</t>

              <t>Validate the content of the data exchanged; it must conform
              to the rules of the exchange.</t>

              <t>One must also defend the channel against denial of service
              attacks.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>In other words, there is a need to secure the channel that
          carries a message, and there is a need to secure the exchanges, both
          by knowing the source of the information and to have proof of its
          validity. Three examples suffice to illustrate the challenges.</t>

          <t>One common attack is to bombard a transport session (an
          application's channel) with reset messages. If the attacker is
          lucky, he might cause the session to fail. Including information in
          the transport header or a related protocol like IPsec or TLS that
          identifies the right messages and facilitates speedy discard of the
          rest can mitigate this.</t>

          <t>Another common attack involves unauthorized communication with a
          router or a service. For example, an unauthorized party might try to
          join the routing system. One wants the ISP's router, before
          accepting routing information from a new peer, to<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>demand identification from the new peer,</t>

              <t>verify that the peer is in fact who it claims to be, and</t>

              <t>verify that it is authorized to carry on the exchange.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>More generally, in securing the channel, one wants to verify that
          messages putatively received from a peer were in fact received from
          the peer, and given that they are, to only carry on transactions
          with peers that one trusts. This is analogous to how one responds to
          a salesman at the front door - one asks who the salesman represents,
          seeks a credential as proof, and then asks one self whether one
          wants to deal with that company. Only if all indications are
          positive does one carry on a transaction.</t>

          <t>Unfortunately, even trusted peers can be the purveyors of
          incorrect or malicious content; having secured the channel, one also
          wants to secure the information exchanged through the channel. In
          electronic mail and other database exchanges, it may be necessary to
          be able to verify the identity of the sender and the correctness of
          the content long after the information exchange has occurred - for
          example, if a contract is exchanged that is secured by digital
          signatures, one will wish to be able to verify those signatures at
          least throughout the lifetime of the contract, and probably a long
          time after that.</t>

          <t>The third "A" in "AAA" is Accounting. This service is especially
          important for Internet Service Providers; the related service of
          auditing is important for enterprises. RADIUS and DIAMETER are
          commonly used to realize these services.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Confidentiality">
          <t>At several layers, there is a question of confidentiality. If one
          is putting one's credit card in a transaction, one wants application
          layer privacy, which might be supplied by an encrypting application
          or transport layer protocol. If one is trying to hide one's network
          structure, one might additionally want to encrypt the network layer
          header.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="infra" title="Network Infrastructure">
        <t>While these are not critical to the design of a specific system,
        they are important to running a network. We therefore bring them
        up.</t>

        <section anchor="dns" title="Domain Name System (DNS)">
          <t>While not critical to running a network, certain functions are
          made a lot easier if numeric addresses can be replaced with mnemonic
          names. This facilitates renumbering of networks, which happens, and
          generally improves the manageability and serviceability of the
          network. DNS has a set of security extensions called DNSSEC, which
          can be used to provide strong cryptographic authentication to that
          protocol.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Network Management Issues">
          <t>Network management has proven to be a difficult problem; there
          are many solutions, and each has proponents with solid arguments for
          their viewpoint. In the IETF, we have two major network management
          solutions for device operation: SNMP, which is ASN.1-encoded and is
          primarily used for monitoring of system variables in a polled
          architecture, and NetConf, which is XML-encoded and primarily used
          for device configuration.</t>

          <t>Another aspect of network management is the initial provisioning
          and configuration of hosts. Address assignment and other
          configuration is discussed in <xref target="dhcp"></xref>. Smart

        <section title="Session identification, authentication, authorization, and accounting">
          <t>In the Internet Protocol Suite there are several approaches to
          AAA issues; generally, one chooses one of them for a purpose. As
          they have different attack surfaces and protection domains, they
          require some thought in application. Two important ones are the IP
          Security Architecture, which protects IP datagrams, and Transport

        <section title="IP Security Architecture (IPsec)">
          <t>The <xref target="RFC4301">Security Architecture for the Internet
          Protocol</xref> is a set of control and data protocols that are
          implemented between IPv4 and its Transport layer, or in IPv6's
          Security extension header. It allows transport layer sessions (which
          underlie applications) to communicate in a way that is designed to
          prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. The
          architecture is spelled out in a number of additional specifications
          for specific components: the <xref target="RFC4302">IP
          Authentication Header</xref> <xref target="RFC4303">Encapsulating
          Security Payload (ESP)</xref>, <xref target="RFC4306">Internet Key

          <xref target="RFC4309">Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
          </xref>.</t>

          <t>In the transport mode, IPsec ESP encrypts the transport layer and
          the application data. In the tunnel mode, which is frequently used
          for Virtual Private Networks, one also encrypts the Internet
          Protocol, and encapsulates the encrypted data inside a second IP

          opposed to TCP's byte streams). The design of SCTP includes
          appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding
          and masquerade attacks. As it uses a message stream interface as

          <t>SCTP offers several delivery options. The basic service is

          each stream in use. Since streams are independent, one stream may
          pause due to head of line blocking while another stream in the same
          session continues to deliver data. In addition, SCTP provides a
          mechanism for bypassing the sequenced delivery service. User
          messages sent using this mechanism are delivered to the SCTP user as

          <t>The Network Time Protocol was originally designed by Dave Mills
          of the University of Delaware and CSNET, for the purpose of
          implementing a temporal metric in the Fuzzball Routing Protocol and
          generally coordinating time experiments. The current versions of the

          target="RFC4916"></xref><xref target="RFC5393"></xref><xref
          target="RFC5621"></xref> is an application layer control (signaling)
          protocol for creating, modifying and terminating multimedia sessions
          on the Internet, meant to be more scalable than H.323. Multimedia
          sessions can be voice, video, instant messaging, shared data, and/or
          subscriptions of events. SIP can run on top of TCP, UDP, SCTP, or
          TLS over TCP. SIP is independent of the transport layer, and
          independent of the underlying IPv4/v6 version. In fact, the
          transport protocol used can change as the SIP message traverses SIP
          entities from source to destination.</t>

          <t>SIP itself does not choose whether a session is voice or video,
          the <xref target="RFC4566">SDP: Session Description Protocol</xref>.
          Within the SDP, which is transported by SIP, codecs are offered and
          accepted (or not), the port number and IP address is decided for
          where each endpoint wants to receive their <xref
          target="RFC3550">RTP</xref> packets. This part is critical to
          understand because of the affect on NATs. Unless a NAT (with or
          without a Firewall) is designed to be SDP aware (i.e., looking into
          each packet far enough to discover what the IP address and port
          number is for this particular session - and resetting it based on
          the <xref target="RFC5389">Session Traversal Utilities for
          NAT</xref>, the session established by SIP will not result in RTP
          packets being sent to the proper endpoint (in SIP called a user
          agent, or UA). It should be noted that SIP messaging has no issues
          with NATs, it is just the UA's inability to generally learn about
          the presence of the NATs that prevent the RTP packets from being
          received by the UA establishing the session.</t>

    <section anchor="network"
             title="A simplied view of the business architecture">
      <t>The Internet was originally structured in such a way that any host
      could directly connect to any other host for which it could determine an
      IP address. That was very quickly found to have issues, and folks found
      ways to change that. To understand the implications, one must
      understand, at a high level, the business structure of the Internet.</t>

      <t>The Internet, whose name implies that it is a network of networks,
      may be understood as a number of interconnected businesses. Central to
      its business structure are the networks that provide connectivity to
      other networks, called "Transit Providers". These networks sell bulk
      bandwidth to each other, and to other networks as customers. Around the
      periphery of these networks, one finds companies, schools, and other
      networks that provide services directly to individuals. These might
      generally be divided into "Enterprise Networks" and "Access Networks";
      Enterprise networks provide "free" connectivity to their own employees
      or members, and also provide them a set of services including electronic
      mail, web services, and so on. Access Networks sell broadband
      connectivity (DSL, Cable Modem, 802.11 wireless or 3GPP wireless), or
      "dial" services including PSTN dial-up and ISDN, to subscribers. The
      subscribers are typically either residential or small office/home office
      (SOHO) customers. Residential customers are generally entirely dependent
      on their access provider for all services, while a SOHO buys some
      services from the access provider and may provide others for itself.
      Networks that sell transit services to nobody else - SOHO, residential,
      and enterprise networks - are generally refereed to as "edge networks";
      Transit Networks are considered to be part of the "core" of the
      Internet, and access networks are between the two. This general
      structure is depicted in <xref
      target="business-architecture"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In both cases, it will be observed that the author's home internally
      uses address space from the <xref target="RFC1918">Address Allocation
      for Private Internets</xref>, and other networks generally use public
      address space. It will also be observed that on entry to UCSB, the
      traceroute in <xref target="traceroute"></xref> terminates before
      arriving at the target.</t>

      <t>Three middleware technologies are in obvious use here. These are the
      use of a firewall, a Network Address Translator (NAT), and a Virtual
      Private Network (VPN).</t>

      <t>Firewalls are generally sold as, and considered, a security
      technology. A firewall imposes a border between two administrative
      domains, which are usually a residential, SOHO, or enterprise network
      and its access or transit provider. In its essence, a firewall is a data
      diode, imposing a policy on what sessions may pass between a protected
      domain and the rest of the Internet. Simple policies generally permit
      sessions to be originated from the protected network but not from the
      outside; more complex policies may permit additional sessions from the
      outside, as electronic mail to a mail server or a web session to a web
      server, and may prevent certain applications from global access even
      though they are originated from the inside. Firewalls are controversial
      in the Internet community; network managers often insist on them simply
      because they impose a boundary; others point out that their value as a
      security solution is debatable, as most attacks come from behind the
      firewall and application layer attacks such as viruses carried in email
      or Active X are invisible to them. In general, as a security solution,
      they are justified as a defense in depth; while the end system must in
      the end be responsible for its own security, a firewall can inhibit or
      prevent certain kinds of attacks from certain quarters such as the
      consumption of CPU time on a critical server. Key documents describing
      firewall technology and the issues it poses include:<list

      <t>Network Address Translation is a technology that was developed in
      response to ISP behaviors in the mid-1990's; when <xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref> was published, many ISPs started handing out
      single or small numbers of addresses, and edge networks were forced to
      translate. In time, this became considered a good thing, or at least not
      a bad thing; it amplified the public address space, and it was sold as
      if it were a firewall. It of course is not; while traditional dynamic
      NATs only translate between internal and external session address/aport
      tuples during the detected duration of the session, that session state
      may exist in the network much longer than it exists on the end system,
      and as a result constitutes an attack vector. The design, value, and
      limitations of network address translation are described in: <list
