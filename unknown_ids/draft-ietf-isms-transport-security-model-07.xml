    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This memo describes a Transport Security Model for the Simple Network
      Management Protocol, for use with secure Transport Models in the
      Transport Subsystem <xref target="I-D.ietf-isms-tmsm"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This memo also defines a portion of the Management Information Base
      (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based
      internets. In particular it defines objects for monitoring and managing
      the Transport Security Model for SNMP.</t>

      <t>It is important to understand the SNMP architecture and the
      terminology of the architecture to understand where the Transport
      Security Model described in this memo fits into the architecture and
      interacts with other subsystems and models within the architecture. It
      is expected that reader will have also read and understood RFC3411 <xref
      target="RFC3411"></xref>, RFC3412 <xref target="RFC3412"></xref>,
      RFC3413 <xref target="RFC3413"></xref>, and RFC3418 <xref
      target="RFC3418"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="The Internet-Standard Management Framework">
        <t>For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
        Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
        RFC 3410 <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
        (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in
        the Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a
        MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD
        58, RFC 2578 <xref target="RFC2578"></xref>, STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref
        target="RFC2579"></xref> and STD 58, RFC 2580 <xref
        target="RFC2580"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Conventions">
        <t>For consistency with SNMP-related specifications, this document
        favors terminology as defined in STD62 rather than favoring
        terminology that is consistent with non-SNMP specifications that use
        different variations of the same terminology. This is consistent with
        the IESG decision to not require the SNMPv3 terminology be modified to
        match the usage of other non-SNMP specifications when SNMPv3 was
        advanced to Full Standard.</t>

        <t>Authentication in this document typically refers to the English
        meaning of "serving to prove the authenticity of" the message, not
        data source authentication or peer identity authentication.</t>

        <t>The terms "manager" and "agent" are not used in this document,
        because in the RFC 3411 architecture, all SNMP entities have the
        capability of acting as either manager or agent or both depending on
        the SNMP applications included in the engine. Where distinction is
        required, the application names of Command Generator, Command
        Responder, Notification Originator, Notification Receiver, and Proxy
        Forwarder are used. See "SNMP Applications" <xref
        target="RFC3413"></xref> for further information.</t>

        <t>While security protocols frequently refer to a user, the
        terminology used in RFC3411 <xref target="RFC3411"></xref> and in this
        memo is "principal". A principal is the "who" on whose behalf services
        are provided or processing takes place. A principal can be, among
        other things, an individual acting in a particular role; a set of
        individuals, with each acting in a particular role; an application or
        a set of applications, or a combination of these within an
        administrative domain.</t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Modularity">
        <t>The reader is expected to have read and understood the description
        of the SNMP architecture, as defined in <xref
        target="RFC3411"></xref>, and the architecture extension specified in
        "Transport Subsystem for the Simple Network Management Protocol" <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-isms-tmsm"></xref>, which enables the use of external
        "lower layer transport" protocols to provide message security, tied
        into the SNMP architecture through the Transport Subsystem. The
        Transport Security Model is designed to work with such lower-layer
        secure Transport Models.</t>

        <t>In keeping with the RFC 3411 design decisions to use self-contained
        documents, this memo includes the elements of procedure plus
        associated MIB objects which are needed for processing the Transport
        Security Model for SNMP. These MIB objects SHOULD not be referenced in
        other documents. This allows the Transport Security Model to be
        designed and documented as independent and self-contained, having no
        direct impact on other modules, and allowing this module to be
        upgraded and supplemented as the need arises, and to move along the
        standards track on different time-lines from other modules.</t>

        <t>This modularity of specification is not meant to be interpreted as
        imposing any specific requirements on implementation.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Motivation">
        <t>This memo describes a Security Model to make use of Transport
        Models that use lower layer secure transports and existing and
        commonly deployed security infrastructures. This Security Model is
        designed to meet the security and operational needs of network
        administrators, maximize usability in operational environments to
        achieve high deployment success and at the same time minimize
        implementation and deployment costs to minimize the time until
        deployment is possible.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Constraints">
        <t>The design of this SNMP Security Model is also influenced by the
        following constraints: <list style="numbers">
            <t>In times of network stress, the security protocol and its
            underlying security mechanisms SHOULD NOT depend solely upon the
            ready availability of other network services (e.g., Network Time
            Protocol (NTP) or Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
            (AAA) protocols).</t>

            <t>When the network is not under stress, the Security Model and
            its underlying security mechanisms MAY depend upon the ready
            availability of other network services.</t>

            <t>It may not be possible for the Security Model to determine when
            the network is under stress.</t>

            <t>A Security Model should require no changes to the SNMP
            architecture.</t>

            <t>A Security Model should require no changes to the underlying
            security protocol.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <!-- ********************************************* -->

    <section title="How the Transport Security Model Fits in the Architecture">
      <t>The Transport Security Model is designed to fit into the RFC3411
      architecture as a Security Model in the Security Subsystem, and to
      utilize the services of a secure Transport Model.</t>

      <t>A cache, referenced by tmStateReference, is used to pass information
      between the Transport Security Model and a Transport Model, and vice
      versa. If the Transport Security Model is used with an insecure
      Transport Model, then the cache will not exist or be populated with
      security parameters, which will cause the Transport Security Model to
      return an error (see section 5.2) If another Security Model (eg
      Community-based Security Model) is used with a secure Transport Model,
      then the cache may be populated but the other Security Model may be
      unaware of the cache and ignore its contents (eg deriving the
      securityName from the Community name in the message instead of deriving
      it from the tmSecurityName in the tmStateReference cache).</t>

      <t>When a secure Transport Model creates a tmStateReference cache for an
      incoming message, it will include a tmTransport, tmAddress,
      tmSecurityName and a tmTransportSecurityLevel, and it MAY include
      transport-specific information. When the Transport Security Model sends
      a message, it will create a cache containing the specified
      transportDomain, transportAddress, securityName, and securityLevel
      parameters. The Transport Security Model will pass the tmStateReference
      to enable the transport model to extract corresponding
      transport-specific information from the tmStateReference cache, in an
      implementation-dependent manner.</t>

      <t>When the Transport Security Model determines that a cache does not
      yet exist corresponding to the specified transportDomain,
      transportAddress, secuirtyName, and securityLevel parameters, it creates
      one that contains a tmSecurityName and tmRequestedSecurityLevel and
      passes the tmStateReference cache to the specified Transport Model.</t>

      <t>The Transport Security Model will determine the
      security-model-independent securityName and securityLevel, and will
      verify for incoming messages that tmTransportSecurityLevel is at least
      as strong as the requested securityLevel.</t>

      <t>To maintain the RFC3411 modularity, the Transport Model does not know
      which securityModel will be used for an incoming message; the Message
      Processing Model will determine the securityModel to be used, in a
      Message Processing Model dependent manner.</t>

      <section title="Security Capabilities of this Model">
        <section title="Threats">
          <t>The Transport Security Model, when used with suitable secure
          Transport Models, provides protection against the threats identified
          by the RFC 3411 architecture <xref target="RFC3411"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Which threats are addressed depends on the Transport Model. The
          Transport Security Model does not address any threats itself, but
          delegates that responsibility to a secure Transport Model.</t>

          <t>The Transport Security Model is called a Security Model to be
          compatible with the RFC3411 architecture. However, this Security
          Model does not provide security mechanisms such as authentication
          and encryption itself, so it SHOULD always be used with a Transport
          Model that provides appropriate security.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Security Levels">
          <t>The RFC 3411 architecture recognizes three levels of security:
          <list>
              <t>- without authentication and without privacy
              (noAuthNoPriv)</t>

              <t>- with authentication but without privacy (authNoPriv)</t>

              <t>- with authentication and with privacy (authPriv)</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The model-independent securityLevel parameter is used to request
          specific levels of security for outgoing messages, and to assert
          that specific levels of security were applied during the transport
          and processing of incoming messages.</t>

          <t>The transport layer algorithms used to provide security SHOULD
          NOT be exposed to the Transport Security Model, as the Transport
          Security Model has no mechanisms by which it can test whether an
          assertion made by a Transport Model is accurate.</t>

          <t>The Transport Security Model trusts that the underlying secure
          transport connection has been properly configured to support
          security characteristics at least as strong as reported in
          tmTransportSecurityLevel.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="No Sessions">
        <t>The Transport Security Model will associate state regarding each
        message and each known remote engine with a combination of
        transportDomain, transportAddress, securityName, securityModel, and
        securityLevel.</t>

        <t>The Transport Security Model does not recognize sessions of any
        kind, although they may be supported by a transport model.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Coexistence">
        <t>There are two primary factors which determine whether Security
        Models can coexist. First, there must be a mechanism to select
        different Security Models at run-time. Second, the processing of one
        Security Model should not impact the processing of another Security
        Model.</t>

        <t>In the RFC3411 architecture, a Message Processing Model determines
        which Security Model should be called. As of this writing, IANA has
        registered four Message Processing Models (SNMPv1, SNMPv2c,
        SNMPv2u/SNMPv2*, and SNMPv3) and three other Security Models (SNMPv1,
        SNMPv2c, and the User-based Security Model).</t>

        <t>The SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c message processing described in RFC3584 (BCP
        74) <xref target="RFC3584"></xref> always selects the SNMPv1(1)
        Security Model for an SNMPv1 message, or the SNMPv2c(2) Security Model
        for an SNMPv2c message. Since there is no field in the message format
        that permits specifying a Security Model, RFC3584 message processing
        does not permit the selection of Security Models other than SNMPv1 or
        SNMPv2. Therefore, SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c messages that go through the
        SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 Message Processing Models **as defined in RFC3584**
        cannot use the Transport Security Model. (This does not mean an SNMPv1
        or SNMPv2 message cannot use a secure transport model, only that the
        RFC3584 Message Processing Model will not invoke this security
        model.)</t>

        <t>The SNMPv2u/SNMPv2* Message Processing Model is a historic artifact
        for which there is no existing IETF specification.</t>

        <t>The SNMPv3 message processing defined in RFC3412 <xref
        target="RFC3412"></xref>, extracts the securityModel from the
        msgSecurityModel field of an incoming SNMPv3Message. When the
        extracted value of msgSecurityModel is transportSecurityModel(YY),
        security processing is directed to the Transport Security Model. For
        an outgoing message to be secured using the Transport Security Model,
        msgSecurityModel should be set to transportSecurityModel(YY).</t>

        <t>[-- NOTE to RFC editor: replace YY with actual IANA-assigned
        number, and remove this note. ]</t>

        <t>The Transport Security Model uses its own MIB module for processing
        to maintain independence from other Security Models. This allows the
        Transport Security Model to coexist with other Security Models, such
        as the User-based Security Model.</t>

        <t>Note that the Transport Security Model may work with multiple
        Transport Models, but the isAccessAllowed() application service
        interfaces (ASI) only accepts a value for the Security Model, not for
        Transport Models. As a result, it is not possible to have different
        access control rules for different Transport Models that use the
        Transport Security Model.</t>
      </section>

      <!-- **************************************************** -->

      <section title="Security Parameter Passing">
        <t>For outgoing messages, Transport Security Model uses parameters
        provided by the SNMP application to determine if a corresponding
        tmStateReference cache exists, or to create a suitable
        tmStateReference cache. The wholeMsg and the tmStateReference are
        passed to the appropriate Transport Model through a series of ASIs, as
        described in "Transport Subsystem for the Simple Network Management
        Protocol" <xref target="I-D.ietf-isms-tmsm"></xref>.</t>

        <t>For incoming messages, the Transport Model accepts messages from
        the lower layer transport, and records the transport-related
        information and security-related information, including a
        tmSecurityName that represents the transport-authenticated identity,
        and a tmTransportSecurityLevel that represents the security features
        provided during transport, in a cache referenced by tmStateReference.
        The wholeMsg and the tmStateReference are passed to the appropriate
        Security Model through a series of ASIs, as described in "Transport
        Subsystem for the Simple Network Management Protocol" <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-isms-tmsm"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <!-- **************************************************************** -->

      <section title="Notifications and Proxy">
        <t>The SNMP-TARGET-MIB module <xref target="RFC3413"></xref> contains
        objects for defining management targets, including transportDomain,
        transportAddress, securityName, securityModel, and securityLevel
        parameters, for applications such as notifications and proxy.
        Transport type and address are configured in the snmpTargetAddrTable,
        and the securityModel, securityName, and securityLevel parameters are
        configured in the snmpTargetParamsTable.</t>

        <t>For the Transport Security Model, these will be translated as
        needed into tmSecurityName and tmRequestedSecurityLevel.</t>

        <t>The default approach is for an administrator to statically
        configure this information to identify the targets authorized to
        receive notifications or perform proxy.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <!-- **************************************************** -->

    <section title="Cached Information and References">
      <t>The RFC3411 architecture uses caches to store dynamic model-specific
      information, and uses references in the ASIs to indicate in a
      model-independent manner which cached information must flow between
      subsystems.</t>

      <t>There are two levels of state that may need to be maintained: the
      security state in a request-response pair, and potentially long-term
      state relating to transport and security. This document describes
      caches, and differentiates the tmStateReference from the
      securityStateReference, but how this is represented internally is an
      implementation decision.</t>

      <t>As a general rule, if state information is available when a message
      being processed gets discarded, the state related to that message should
      also be discarded, and if state information is available when a
      relationship between engines is severed, such as the closing of a
      transport connection, the state information for that relationship might
      also be discarded.</t>

      <section title="tmStateReference">
        <t>For each transport model, information about the transport security
        may be stored in a cache to pass model- and mechanism-specific
        parameters.</t>

        <t>For security reasons, the Transport Security Model REQUIRES that
        the security parameters used for a response are the same as those used
        for the corresponding request, and passes a tmSameSecurity parameter
        in the tmStateReference cache for outgoing messages to indicate that
        the same security MUST be used for the outgoing response as was used
        for the corresponding incoming request. It is
        transport-model-dependent and implementation-dependent how this is
        ensured at the transport layer.</t>

        <t>Since the contents of a cache are meaningful only within an
        implementation, and not on-the-wire, the format of the cache is
        implementation-specific.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="securityStateReference">
        <t>The securityStateReference parameter is defined in RFC3411. Its
        primary purpose is to provide a mapping between a request and the
        corresponding response. A sample model-specific cache can be found in
        RFC3414 <xref target="RFC3414"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Transport models do not have access to the securityStateReference.
        For the Transport Security Model, it is important to ensure that the
        security parameters used for a request match those used for the
        corresponding response. The Transport Security Model will conceptually
        add the tmStateReference to the securityStateReference cache, so the
        transport model can map transport-specific security parameters for a
        request to its corresponding response. How the tmStateReference is
        added to the securityStateReference is implementation-specific.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Processing an Outgoing Message">
      <t>An error indication may return an OID and value for an incremented
      counter and a value for securityLevel, and values for contextEngineID
      and contextName for the counter, and the securityStateReference if the
      information is available at the point where the error is detected.</t>

      <section title="Security Processing for an Outgoing Message">
        <t>This section describes the procedure followed by the Transport
        Security Model.</t>

        <t>The parameters needed for generating a message are supplied to the
        Security Model by the Message Processing Model via the
        generateRequestMsg() or the generateResponseMsg() ASI. The Transport
        Subsystem architectural extension has added the transportDomain,
        transportAddress, and tmStateReference parameters to the original

       DESCRIPTION  "The Transport Security Model MIB

                     In keeping with the RFC 3411 design decisions 
                     to use self-contained documents, the RFC which
                     contains the definition of this MIB module also
                     includes the elements of procedure which are 
                     needed for processing the Transport Security
                     Model for SNMP. These MIB objects 
                     SHOULD NOT be modified via other documents. 
                     This allows the Transport Security Model 
                     for SNMP to be designed and documented as 
                     independent and self- contained, having no 
                     direct impact on other modules, and this 
                     allows this module to be upgraded and 
                     supplemented as the need arises, and to 
                     move along the standards track on different 
                     time-lines from other modules.

    <!-- 	***************************************************** 	-->

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document describes a Security Model that permits SNMP to utilize
      security services provided through an SNMP Transport Model. The
      Transport Security Model relies on Transport Models for mutual
      authentication, binding of keys, confidentiality and integrity. The
      security threats and how those threats are mitigated should be covered
      in detail in the specification of the Transport Model and the underlying
      secure transport.</t>

      <t>Transport Security Model relies on a Transport Model to provide an
      authenticated principal for mapping to securityName, and an assertion of
      tmTransportSecurityLevel.</t>

      <t>The Transport Security Model is called a Security Model to be
      compatible with the RFC3411 architecture. However, this Security Model
      provides no security itself. It SHOULD always be used with a Transport
      Model that provides security, but this is a run-time decision of the
      operator or management application, or a configuration decision of an
      operator.</t>

      <section title="MIB module security">
        <t>There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that
        have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. So, if this
        MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
        intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module
        via direct SNMP SET operations.</t>

        <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with
        a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
        vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to
        control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to
        even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the
        network via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
        sensitivity/vulnerability: <list style="symbols">
            <!-- list the tables and objects and state why they are sensitive -->

            <t>snmpTsmInvalidCaches and snmpTsmInadequateSecurityLevels may
            make it easier for an attacker to detect vulnerabilities.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
        even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
        allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
        in this MIB module.</t>

        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features
        as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref
        target="RFC3410"></xref> section 8), including full support for the
        USM and Transport Security Model cryptographic mechanisms (for
        authentication and privacy).</t>

        <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
        RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
        cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility
        to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this
        MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only
        to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET
        or SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>

    <section title="Notification Tables Configuration">
      <t>The SNMP-TARGET-MIB and SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB <xref
      target="RFC3413"></xref> are used to configure notification originators
      with the destinations to which notifications should be sent.</t>

      <t>Most of the configuration is security-model-independent and
      transport-model-independent.</t>

      <t>The values we will use in the examples for the five model-independent
      security and transport parameters are: <list>
          <t>transportDomain = snmpSSHDomain</t>

          <t>transportAddress = 192.0.2.1:162</t>

          <t>securityModel = Transport Security Model</t>

          <t>securityName = sampleUser</t>

          <t>securityLevel = authPriv</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The following example will configure the Notification Originator to
      send informs to a Notification Receiver at host 192.0.2.1 port 162 using
      the securityName "sampleUser". The columns marked with a "*" are the
      items that are Security Model or Transport Model specific.</t>

      <t>The configuration for the "sampleUser" settings in the
      SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB objects are not shown here for brevity. First we
      configure which type of notification should be sent for this taglist
      (toCRTag). In this example, we choose to send an Inform.</t>

        <artwork><![CDATA[  snmpNotifyTable row:
       snmpNotifyName                 CRNotif
       snmpNotifyTag                  toCRTag 
       snmpNotifyType                 inform
       snmpNotifyStorageType          nonVolatile
       snmpNotifyColumnStatus         createAndGo]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>Then we configure a transport address to which notifications
      associated with this taglist should be sent, and we specify which
      snmpTargetParamsEntry should be used (toCR) when sending to this
      transport address.</t>

        <artwork><![CDATA[       snmpTargetAddrTable row:

          snmpTargetAddrTAddress          192.0.2.1:162     
          snmpTargetAddrTimeout           1500           
          snmpTargetAddrRetryCount        3       
          snmpTargetAddrTagList           toCRTag         
          snmpTargetAddrParams            toCR   (must match below) 
          snmpTargetAddrStorageType       nonVolatile
          snmpTargetAddrColumnStatus      createAndGo 

]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>Then we configure which principal at the host should receive the
      notifications associated with this taglist. Here we choose "sampleUser",
      who uses the Transport Security Model.</t>

      *   snmpTargetParamsSecurityModel   TransportSecurityModel       
          snmpTargetParamsSecurityName    "sampleUser"    
          snmpTargetParamsSecurityLevel   authPriv

    <section title="Processing Differences between USM and Secure Transport">
      <t>USM and secure transports differ in the processing order and
      responsibilities within the RFC3411 architecture. While the steps are
      the same, they occur in a different order, and may be done by different
      subsystems. The following lists illustrate the difference in the flow
      and the responsibility for different processing steps for incoming
      messages when using USM and when using a secure transport. (Note that
      these lists are simplified for illustrative purposes, and do not
      represent all details of processing. Transport Models must provide the
      detailed elements of procedure.)</t>

      <t>With USM and other Security Models, security processing starts when
      the Message Processing Model decodes portions of the ASN.1 message to
      extract an opaque block of security parameters and header parameters
      that identify which Security Model should process the message to perform
      authentication, decryption, timeliness checking, integrity checking, and
      translation of parameters to model-independent parameters. A secure
      transport performs those security functions on the message, before the
      ASN.1 is decoded.</t>

      <t>Step 6 cannot occur until after decryption occurs. Step 6 and beyond
      are the same for USM and a secure transport.</t>
