                    Internationalized Email Headers
                      draft-ietf-eai-rfc5335bis-12

Abstract

   Internet mail was originally limited to 7-bit ASCII.  MIME added
   support for the use of 8-bit character sets in body parts, and also
   defined an encoded-word construct so other character sets could be
   used in certain header field values.  But full internationalization
   of electronic mail requires additional enhancements to allow the use
   of Unicode, including characters outside the ASCII repertoire, in
   mail addresses as well as direct use of Unicode in header fields like
   From:, To:, and Subject:, without requiring the use of complex
   encoded-word constructs.  This document specifies an enhancement to
   the Internet Message Format that allows use of Unicode in mail
   addresses and most header field content.

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers             September 2011


1.  Introduction

   Internet mail distinguishes a message from its transport and further
   divides a message between a header and a body [RFC5598].  Internet
   mail header field values contain a variety of strings that are
   intended to be user-visible.  The range of supported characters for
   these strings was originally limited to 7-bit [ASCII].  MIME
   [RFC2045] [RFC2046] [RFC2047] provides the ability to use additional
   character sets, but this support is limited to body part data and to
   special encoded-word constructs that were only allowed in a limited
   number of places in header field values.

   Globalization of the Internet requires support of the much larger set
   of characters provided by Unicode [RFC5198] in both mail addresses
   and most header field values.  Additionally, complex encoding schemes
   like encoded-words introduce inefficiencies as well as significant
   opportunities for processing errors.  And finally, native support for
   the UTF-8 charset is now available on most systems.  Hence it is
   strongly desirable for Internet mail to support UTF-8 [RFC3629]
   directly.

   This document specifies an enhancement to the Internet Message Format
   [RFC5322] and to MIME that permits the direct use of UTF-8, rather
   than only ASCII, in header field values, including mail addresses.  A
   new media type, message/global, is defined for messages that use this
   extended format.  This specification also lifts the MIME restriction
   on having non-identity content-transfer-encodings on any subtype of
   the message top-level type so that message/global parts can be safely
   transmitted across existing mail infrastructure.

   This specification is based on a model of native, end-to-end support
   for UTF-8, which depends on having an "8-bit clean" environment
   assured by the transport system.  Support for carriage across legacy,
   7-bit infrastructure and for processing by 7-bit receivers requires
   additional mechanisms that are not provided by these specifications.

2.  Terminology Used In This Specification

   A plain ASCII string is fully compatible with [RFC5321] and
   [RFC5322].  In this document, non-ASCII strings are UTF-8 strings if
   they are in header field values which contain at least one <UTF8-non-
   ascii> (see Section 3.1).

   Unless otherwise noted, all terms used here are defined in [RFC5321],
   [RFC5322], [I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis], or
   [I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers             September 2011


   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The term "8-bit" means octets are present in the data with values
   above 0x7F.

3.  Changes to Message Header Fields

   To permit Unicode characters in field values, the header definition
   in [RFC5322] is extended to support the new format.  The following
   sections specify the necessary changes to RFC 5322's ABNF.

   The syntax rules not mentioned below remain defined as in [RFC5322].

   Note that this protocol does not change RFC 5322 rules for defining
   header field names.  The bodies of header fields are allowed to
   contain Unicode characters, but the header field names themselves
   must contain only ASCII characters.

   Also note that messages in this format require the use of the
   &UTF8SMTPbis; extension [I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis] to be transferred
   via SMTP.

3.1.  UTF-8 Syntax and Normalization

   UTF-8 characters can be defined in terms of octets using the
   following ABNF [RFC5234], taken from [RFC3629]:


   UTF8-non-ascii  =   UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4

   UTF8-2          =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>

   UTF8-3          =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>

   UTF8-4          =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>


   See [RFC5198] for a discussion of Unicode normalization;
   normalization form [NFC] SHOULD be used.  Actually, if one is going
   to do internationalization properly, one of the most often-cited
   goals is to permit people to spell their names correctly.  Since many
   mailbox local parts reflect personal names, that principle applies to
   mailboxes as well.  The NFKC normalization form SHOULD NOT be used
   because it may lose information that is needed to correctly spell
   some names in some unusual circumstances.

3.2.  Syntax Extensions to RFC 5322

   The following rules extend the ABNF syntax defined in [RFC5322] and
   [RFC5234] in order to allow UTF-8 content.

   VCHAR   =/  UTF8-non-ascii

   ctext   =/  UTF8-non-ascii

   atext   =/  UTF8-non-ascii

   qtext   =/  UTF8-non-ascii

   text    =/  UTF8-non-ascii
                  ; note that this upgrades the body to UTF-8

   dtext   =/  UTF8-non-ascii


   The preceding changes mean that the following constructs now allow
   UTF-8:

   1.  Unstructured text, used in header fields like Subject: or
       Content-description:.

   2.  Any construct that uses atoms, including but not limited to the
       local parts of addresses and message-ids.  This includes
       addresses in the "for" clauses of Received: header fields.

   3.  Quoted strings.

   4.  Domains.

   Note that header field names are not on this list; these are still
   restricted to ASCII.

3.3.  Use of 8-bit UTF-8 in Message-Ids

   Implementers of message-id generation algorithms MAY prefer to
   restrain their output to ASCII since that has some advantages, such
   as when constructing References fields in mailing-list threads where
   some senders use EAI and others not.

3.4.  Effects on Line Length Limits

   Section 2.1.1 of [RFC5322] limits lines to 998 characters and
   recommends that the lines be restricted to only 78 characters.  This
   specification changes the former limit to 988 octets.  (Note that in

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers             September 2011


   ASCII octets and characters are effectively the same but this is not
   true in UTF-8.)  The 78 character limit remains defined in terms of
   characters, not octets, since it is intended to address display width
   issues, not line length issues.

3.5.  Changes to MIME Message Type Encoding Restrictions

   This specification updates Section 6.4 of [RFC2045].  [RFC2045]
   prohibits applying a content-transfer-encoding to any subtypes of
   "message/".  This specification relaxes that rule -- it allows newly
   defined MIME types to permit content-transfer-encoding, and it allows
   content-transfer-encoding for message/global (see Section 3.7).

   Background: Normally, transfer of message/global will be done in
   8-bit-clean channels, and body parts will have "identity" encodings,
   that is, no decoding is necessary.

   But in the case where a message containing a message/global is
   downgraded from 8-bit to 7-bit as described in [RFC6152], an encoding
   might have to be applied to the message; if the message travels
   multiple times between a 7-bit environment and an environment
   implementing these extensions, multiple levels of encoding may occur.
   This is expected to be rarely seen in practice, and the potential
   complexity of other ways of dealing with the issue are thought to be
   larger than the complexity of allowing nested encodings where
   necessary.

3.6.  Use of MIME Encoded-Words

   The MIME encoded-words facility [RFC2047] provides the ability to
   place non-ASCII text, but only in a subset of the places allowed by
   this extension.  Additionally, encoded-words are substantially more
   complex since they allow the use of arbitrary charsets.  Accordingly,
   encoded-words SHOULD NOT be used when generating header fields for
   messages employing this extension.  Agents MAY, when incorporating
   material from another message, convert encoded-word use to direct use
   of UTF-8.

   Note that care must be taken when decoding encoded-words because the
   results after replacing an encoded-word with its decoded equivalent
   in UTF-8 may be syntactically invalid.  Processors that elect to
   decode encoded-words MUST NOT generate syntactically invalid fields.

3.7.  The Message/global Media Type

   Internationalized messages in this format MUST only be transmitted as
   authorized by [I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis] or within a non-SMTP
   environment that supports these messages.  A message is a "message/

   global message" if:

   o  it contains 8-bit UTF-8 header values as specified in this
      document, or

   o  it contains 8-bit UTF-8 values in the header fields of body parts.

   The content of a message/global part is otherwise identical to that
   of a message/rfc822 part.

   If this type is sent to a 7-bit-only system, it has to have an
   appropriate content-transfer-encoding applied.  (Note that a system
   compliant with MIME that doesn't recognize message/global is supposed
   to treat it as "application/octet-stream" as described in Section
   5.2.4 of [RFC2046].)

   Type name:  message

   Subtype name:  global

   Required parameters:  none

   Optional parameters:  none

   Encoding considerations:  Any content-transfer-encoding is permitted.
      The 8-bit or binary content-transfer-encodings are recommended
      where permitted.

   Security considerations:  See Section 4.

   Interoperability considerations:  This media type provides
      functionality similar to the message/rfc822 content type for email
      messages with international email headers.  When there is a need
      to embed or return such content in another message, there is
      generally an option to use this media type and leave the content
      unchanged or down-convert the content to message/rfc822.  Both of
      these choices will interoperate with the installed base, but with
      different properties.  Systems unaware of internationalized
      headers will typically treat a message/global body part as an
      unknown attachment, while they will understand the structure of a
      message/rfc822.  However, systems that understand message/global
      will provide functionality superior to the result of a down-
      conversion to message/rfc822.  The most interoperable choice
      depends on the deployed software.

   Published specification:  RFC XXXX

   Applications that use this media type:  SMTP servers and email
      clients that support multipart/report generation or parsing.
      Email clients that forward messages with international headers as
      attachments.

   Additional information:

   Magic number(s):  none

   File extension(s):  The extension ".u8msg" is suggested.

   Macintosh file type code(s):  A uniform type identifier (UTI) of
      "public.utf8-email-message" is suggested.  This conforms to
      "public.message" and "public.composite-content", but does not
      necessarily conform to "public.utf8-plain-text".

   Person & email address to contact for further information:  See the
      Author's Address section of this document.

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:  This is a structured media type that embeds
      other MIME media types.  The 8-bit or binary content-transfer-
      encoding SHOULD be used unless this media type is sent over a
      7-bit-only transport.

4.  Security Considerations

   Because UTF-8 often requires several octets to encode a single
   character, internationalization may cause header field values in
   general and mail addresses in particular to become longer.  As
   specified in [RFC5322], each line of characters MUST be no more than
   998 octets, excluding the CRLF.  On the other hand, MDA (Mail
   Delivery Agent) processes that parse, store, or handle email
   addresses or local parts must take extra care not to overflow
   buffers, truncate addresses, or exceed storage allotments.  Also,
   they must take care, when comparing, to use the entire lengths of the
   addresses.

   There are lots of ways to use UTF-8 to represent something equivalent
   or similar to a particular displayed character or group of
   characters; see the security considerations in [RFC3629] for details

   on the problems this can cause.  The normalization process is
   described in Section 3.1 is recommended to minimize these issues.

   The security impact of UTF-8 headers on email signature systems such
   as Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), S/MIME, and OpenPGP is
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis], Section 14.

   If a user has a non-ASCII mailbox address and an ASCII mailbox
   address, a digital certificate that identifies that user might have
   both addresses in the identity.  Having multiple email addresses as
   identities in a single certificate is already supported in PKIX
   (Public Key Infrastructure for X.509 Certificates) [RFC5280] and
   OpenPGP [RFC3156], but there may be user interface issues associated
   with the introduction of UTF-8 into addresses in this context.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the registration of the message/global
   MIME type using the registration form contained in Section 3.7.
