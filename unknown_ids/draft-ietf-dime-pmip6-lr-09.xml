    <abstract>
      <t>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the
      Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically
      tunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing. The term
      "localized routing" refers to a method by which packets are routed
      directly between an MN's MAG and the MAG of its Correspondent Node (CN)
      without involving any LMA. In order to establish a localized routing
      session between two Mobile Access Gateways in a Proxy Mobile IPv6
      domain, two tasks must be accomplished: <list style="numbers">
          <t>The usage of localized routing must be authorized for both MAGs
          and</t>

          <t>The address of the MAG to which the Correspondent Node (CN) is
          attached must be ascertained</t>
        </list> This document specifies how to accomplish these tasks using
      the Diameter protocol.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC5213">Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)</xref> allows the
      Mobility Access Gateway to optimize media delivery by locally routing
      packets within itself, avoiding tunneling them to the Mobile Node's
      Local Mobility Anchor. This is referred to as "local routing" in RFC
      5213. However, this mechanism is not applicable to the typical scenarios
      in which the MN and CN are connected to different MAGs and are
      registered to the same LMA or different LMAs. In these scenarios (<xref
      target="RFC6279">as described in</xref>), the relevant information
      needed to set up a localized routing path (e.g., the addresses of the
      Mobile Access Gateways to which the MN and CN are respectively attached)
      is distributed between their respective Local Mobility Anchors. This may
      complicate the setup and maintenance of localized routing. <vspace
      blankLines="1" />Therefore, in order to establish a localized routing
      path between the two Mobile Access Gateways, the Mobile Node's MAG must
      identify the LMA that is managing the Correspondent Node's traffic and
      then obtain the address of the Correspondent Node's MAG from that LMA.
      In Proxy Mobile IPv6, the LMA to be assigned to the CN may be maintained
      as a configured entry in the Correspondent Node's policy profile located
      on an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server.
      However, there is no relevant work discussing how AAA-based mechanisms
      can be used by the Mobile Node's LMA to discover the address of the
      Correspondent Node's LMA during the setup of localized routing. The
      method by which the Mobile Node's MAG or LMA interacts with the
      Correspondent Node's LMA to identify the Correspondent Node's MAG is
      also unspecified. <vspace blankLines="1" /> This document describes AAA
      support for the authorization and discovery of PMIPv6 mobility entities
      during localized routing. In LMA discovery, Diameter <xref target="I-D.ietf-dime-rfc3588bis"></xref> 
      is used to authorize the localized routing
      service and provide the Mobile Node's MAG/LMA with information regarding
      the Correspondent Node's LMA. In MAG discovery, AAA is used to determine
      whether Mobile Node's MAG is allowed to fetch the address of the
      Correspondent Node's MAG from the Correspondent Node's LMA. If MAG
      discovery is successful, the Correspondent Node's LMA will respond to
      the Mobile Node's MAG with the address of the Correspondent Node's
      MAG.</t>

            <t>Direct routing of IP packets between MNs anchored to 
            different MAGs without involving any LMA is supported. This bit is
            used with MN-HNP or IPv4-MN-HoA. When a LMA sets this bit in the
            MIP6-Feature-Vector and MN-HNP or IPv4-MN-HoA corresponding to
            the Correspondent Node is carried with this bit, it indicates to the HAAA
            that the Mobile Node associated with this LMA is allowed to use
            localized routing but the LMA needs to know from the HAAA if the
            Correspondent Node is allowed to use localized routing. If the
            MN-HNPs or IPv4-MN-HoAs corresponding to both the Mobile Node and the

            localized routing related signaling is required prior to localized
            routing. If this bit is cleared in the returned

            routing of packets between MNs anchored to the different MAG. The

    <section title="Example Signaling flows">
      <section title="Localized Routing Service Authorization">
        <t>Localized Routing Service Authorization also can happen during the
        network access authentication procedure <xref target="RFC5779"></xref>, i.e., before localized routing is
        initialized. In this case, the preauthorized pairs of LMA/prefix sets
        can be downloaded to Proxy Mobile IPv6 entities during the RFC5779
        procedure. Localized routing can be initiated once the destination of a
        received packet matches one or more of the prefixes received during
        RFC5779 procedure.</t>

        <t><xref target="fig2"></xref> shows an example scenario where MAG1
        acts as a Diameter client, processing the data packet from MN1 to MN2
        and requesting authorization of localized routing. In this example
        scenario, MN1 and MN2 are anchored to LMA1 and LMA2 respectively if
        MN1 and MN2 belong to different LMAs; otherwise, the LMA to which
        MN1 and MN2 are anchored should be the same LMA, i.e., either LMA1 or LMA2.
        In
        the case where MNs belong to different LMAs, in order to setup a
        localized routing path with MAG2, MAG1 must first locate the entity
        that maintains the data required to setup the path (i.e., LMA2) by
        sending a Request message to LMA1. Note that the discovery of LMA2 is
        only done once; the request message is the Localized Routing
        Initialization (LRI) message in  <xref target="fig2"></xref> and
        belongs to the Initial phase of the localized routing.
        Once LMA1 has
        obtained the address of LMA2 from the AAA server, LMA1 may associate the
        address of LMA2 with the Mobile Node's cached data for future use
        (e.g., in case of a handover). The Diameter client in LMA1 sends
        an AAR message to the Diameter server. The message
        contains an instance of the MIP6-Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP (<xref
        target="RFC5447"></xref>, Section 4.2.5) with the
        INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit (<xref target="flagbit"></xref>) set and
        an instance of the MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP (<xref
        target="RFC5779"></xref>, Section 5.3) or an instance of the
        PMIP6-IPv4-Home-Address AVP (<xref target="RFC5779"></xref>, Section
        5.2) containing the IP address/HNP of MN2. <vspace
        blankLines="1" />The Diameter server authorizes localized routing
        service by checking if MN2 is allowed to use localized routing and if
        LMA2 and LMA1 are in the same provider domain. 
        If so, the Diameter
        server responds with an AAA message encapsulating an
        instance of the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP <xref target="RFC5779"></xref>
        containing the IP address and/or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of
        LMA2 and an instance of the MIP6-Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP (<xref
        target="RFC5447"></xref>, Section 4.2.5) with the
        INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit (<xref target="flagbit"/>) 
        set indicating Direct
        routing of IP packets between MNs anchored to different MAGs is
        supported. 
        LMA1 then determines the IP address of LMA2 using the
        data returned in the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP and responds to MAG1 with the
        address of LMA2 in the Localized Routing Acknowledge message (LRA in
        the <xref target="fig2"></xref>). 
        If  MAG1 knows that MN1 and MN2 belong to the same LMA, it requests the address of MAG2 from LMA2
        and uses that address to setup the localized routing path between itself and MAG2 via a Proxy Binding Update 
        (PBU)/Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA) message exchange <xref target="RFC5213"/>.
        Note that whether MN1 and MN2 belong to the same LMA can be verified by looking up the binding cache entries
        corresponding to MN1 and MN2 and comparing the addresses of LMA1 and LMA2.
        </t>

        <t>In the case where MNs share the same LMA, the MAG1 should send a
        request message (LRI in the <xref target="fig2"></xref>) to the LMA for
        localized routing which includes the IP address of MN2. The subsequent
        interaction between LMA1 and the AAA should be exactly the same as the
        case where the MNs belong to different LMAs. If authorization is successful, the LMA may look up 
        the address of MAG2 
        directly based on IP address of MN2 and send a message to MAG1
        with IP address of MAG2 included.</t>

        Section 5.3) or an instance of the PMIP6-IPv4-Home-Address AVP (<xref
        target="RFC5779"></xref>, Section 5.2) containing the IP address/HNP
        of MN2. The Diameter server authorizes localized routing service by
        checking if MN2 is allowed to use localized routing and if LMA2 and
        LMA1 are in the same domain. If so, the Diameter server responds with
        an AA-Answer message encapsulating an instance of the
        MIP6-Agent-Info AVP <xref target="RFC5779"></xref> containing the IP
        address and/or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of LMA2 and an
        instance of the MIP6- Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP (<xref

        INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit (<xref target="flagbit"/>) 
        set indicating direct
        routing of IP packets between MNs anchored to different MAGs is
        supported. . LMA1 then determines the IP address of LMA2 using the
        data returned in the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP and responds to MAG1 with the
        address of LMA2.</t>

        <t>In the case where MNs share the same LMA, the Diameter client in
        LMA1 sends an AA-Request message to the Diameter server. The
        interaction between LMA1 and the Diameter server should be exactly the same as the
        case where MNs belong to different LMAs. If authorization is successful, the LMA may look up the address of MAG2
        directly based on the IP address of MN2 and send a request message (LRI in
        <xref target="fig3"></xref>) to the MAG1 for localized routing
        with the IP address of MAG2 included. The MAG1 confirms the success of
        localized routing if a localized routing path can be setup.</t>

      <section title="Diameter Server Authorizes MAG Location Query">
        <t><xref target="fig5"></xref> shows an example scenario in which LMA2
        acts as a Diameter client, receiving a MAG location request and
        requesting authorization for a MAG location query from the AAA server. In
        this example scenario, MN1 and MN2 may be anchored to LMA1 and LMA2
        respectively or belong to the same LMA. In the case where MNs belong
        to different LMAs, MAG1 or LMA1 should already know that the
        recipient of localized routing is LMA2.
        If MAG1 initiates LR, MAG1 may
        take Option 1 in  <xref target="fig5"></xref> and solicit LMA2 to
        look up the IP address of the MAG to which MN2 is currently attached
        (in this case, MAG2) according to the IP addresses/HNPs of MN2. If
        LMA1 initiates LR, LMA1 may take Option 2 in  <xref
        target="fig5"></xref> and solicit LMA2 to look up the IP address of the
        MAG to which MN2 is currently attached. LMA2 validates the request
        (LRI in <xref target="fig5"></xref>) from MAG1 by sending an AAR 
        to the Diameter server containing the IP address/HNP of MN1
        (encapsulated in an instance of the MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP or an
        instance of PMIP6-IPv4-Home-Address AVP) and an instance of the
        MIP6-Feature- Vector AVP (<xref target="RFC5779"></xref>, Section 5.5)
        with the INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit set. If the authorization is
        successful, the Diameter server responds with an AA-Answer (AAA)
        message encapsulating an instance of the MIP6- Feature-Vector (MFV)
        AVP (<xref target="RFC5447"></xref>, Section 4.2.5) with the
        INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit (<xref target="flagbit"/>) 
        set indicating Direct
        routing of IP packets between MNs anchored to the different MAG is
        supported. LMA2 then looks up the IP address of MAG2 based on the IP
        address/HNP of MN2 and responds to MAG1 or LMA1 with the IP address of
        MAG2. <figure align="center" anchor="fig5"

        <t>In the case where MNs share the same LMA, LR should be initiated by
        LMA1 (i.e., LMA2) since only LMA1 knows that both MN1 and MN2 belong to
        itself by looking up the binding cache entries corresponding to MN1 and MN2.
        Unlike the case where MNs belong to different LMAs, the interaction
        between LMAs in Option 2 is omitted since LMA1 and LMA2 are the same
        entity. The interaction between LMA1 and the AAA should be exactly the
        same as the case where MNs belong to different LMAs.</t>

      <t>Referring to an architecture with multiple AAA servers (as
      illustrated in <xref target="fig6"></xref>), AAA1 may not maintain the
      LMA to be assigned to MN2 as a configured entry in the Correspondent
      Node's Policy profile, as AAA2 holds this information in its policy
      store. In such a case, AAA1 contacts a Diameter redirect agent <xref target="I-D.ietf-dime-rfc3588bis"/>
      to request the AAA server being responsible for maintaining MN2's policy
      profile. AAA2 checks if MN2 is allowed to use localized routing and if
      so, responds with the IP address of LMA2 corresponding to MN2 and sends
      the results back to LMA1 via AAA1. Details about the use of redirect
      agents in this context are beyond scope of this document.</t>
