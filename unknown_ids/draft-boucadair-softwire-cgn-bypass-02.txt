Abstract

   This document proposes a solution to avoid the use of two stateful
   DS-Lite AFTR devices when both end-points are located behind
   different AFTR devices.  For this purpose a new IPv6 extension
   header, called Tunnel Endpoint Extension Header (TEEH), is defined.
   The proposed procedure encourages the use of IPv6 between DS-Lite
   AFTR nodes as a means to avoid the unnecessary crossing of AFTR
   devices.

Internet-Draft            AFTR Bypass Procedure              August 2010


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Purpose

   The main purpose of this document is to investigate solutions to
   avoid the solicitation of some of the (AFTR-embedded) NAT
   capabilities along the path between two hosts located behind AFTR
   devices.

   The advantages of this procedure include:

   o  Better one-way delay: No need to check the payload in the
      originating AFTR and no need to execute ALG operations twice;

   o  Optimised routing path;

   o  Better use of available AFTR resources;

   o  Enhance robustness: an AFTR device is withdrawn from the data
      path.  The stateful nature of DS-Lite AFTR devices will affect the
      overall performance of the communication.  This performance may be
      even more affected when two AFTR devices need to be crossed to
      establish the communication.

1.2.  Terminology

   Within this memo, the term AFTR is used to refer to both following
   schemes:

   o  an AFTR function embedded in a router, and/or

   o  a standalone AFTR with limited routing capabilities (redirection
      capabilities to the AFTR are being enabled in an external router).

   An outbound AFTR is referred to as Source AFTR.

   An inbound AFTR is called a Target AFTR.

   In the example illustrated in Figure 1, if we suppose that A
   initiates a communication towards B, AFTR1 is the Source AFTR and
   AFTR2 is the Target AFTR.

1.3.  Contribution of this Draft

   This document proposes a solution to avoid invoking NAT capabilities
   when several DS-Lite AFTR devices [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite]
   are involved in the data path.  This document encourages the use of
   IPv6 for forwarding traffic between two AFTR devices.

   This memo focuses primarily on the AFTR devices deployed in the same
   administrative domain.  AFTRs located in distinct administrative
   domains are out of scope.

   This document does not make any assumption on the services that may
   require the establishment of direct communications between hosts
   located behind AFTR devices.  Examples of services would be P2P or
   hosting FTP/HTTP/SIP server behind a DS-Lite CPE.

   In order to offload AFTR devices, application-specific solutions
   (e.g., [I-D.carpenter-behave-referral-object]
   [I-D.boucadair-mmusic-ccap], [I-D.boucadair-dispatch-ipv6-atypes])
   may be required to be implemented in order to prefer native IPv6
   communications rather than crossing AFTR devices.

   The implementation of the proposed procedure is not motivated in a
   context where the percentage of traffic involving two AFTR devices is
   minor (e.g., 1%).  Nevertheless, as a side effect, Tunnel Endpoint
   Extension Header (TEEH) (Section 3) may be used to withdraw an AFTR
   from the data path, when both participants are managed by the same
   AFTR.

   When TEEH is not supported, an alternative solution is described in
   Appendix A.


2.  Overall Scenarios

   This section provides an overview of targeted scenarios.

   Figure 2 illustrates the communication between two hosts that are
   located behind an AFTR device.  Two NAT operations are required to be

   performed for the establishment of successful communication between A
   and B. The stateful nature of a DS-Lite AFTR device will presumably
   affect the overall performance of the communication.  This
   performance may be even more affected when two AFTR devices need to
   be crossed to establish the communication.

   Prior to sending datagrams to B, A has retrieved the IPv4 public
   address of B owing to DNS resolution, third party referral, etc.

                        Figure 2: Nominal behaviour

   A first optimisation scenario is shown in Figure 3 where NAT
   capabilities of the Source AFTR are not solicited.  A second
   optimisation scenario is shown in Figure 4 where NAT capabilities of
   the Target AFTR are not solicited.  The latter is not a valid
   scenario since the destination is seen with a public IPv4 address
   which is managed by the Target AFTR (consequently, a NAT44 state must
   be instantiated in the Target AFTR).  The last configuration,
   illustrated in Figure 5, aims at avoiding the use of NAT capabilities
   in both Source and Target AFTRs.  This configuration is impossible to
   implement since the remote destination must always be seen with an
   external public IPv4 address (and/or an IPv6 one).  Having an
   external IPv4 address means that a AFTR has assigned an IPv4 address
   and port number for that host.  Therefore, all the incoming IPv4
   traffic must cross that AFTR.

3.  Tunnel Endpoint Extension Header

   TEEH is a new IPv6 extension header which is used to inform the
   remote party about the destination IPv6 address to be used when
   issuing a response.  Particularly, TEEH is used by the Source AFTR to
   inform the Target AFTR about the IPv6 address of a customer's device
   attached to the Source AFTR.  Therefore, the Target AFTR acts as an
   inbound AFTR for that customer's device.

   The format of the Tunnel Endpoint header is shown in Figure 6.

      following the TEEH header.

   o  Hdr Ext Len (8-bit, unsigned integer): Length of the Tunnel
      Endpoint header in 8-octet units, not including the first 8
      octets.

   o  IPv6 Tunnel Endpoint: Encloses an IPv6 address that should be used
      as source of the encapsulated IPv4-in-IPv6 response.  This field
      must be padded to ensure that the TEEH length is a multiple of 8
      octets.

   When TEEH is included in a received IPv4-in-IPv6 datagram, the answer
   SHOULD be sent to the IPv6 address conveyed in the TEEH.

   When TEEH is inserted by a AFTR in an IPv4-in-IPv6 datagram sent to a
   customer's device, the IPv6 address included in the TEEH SHOULD be
   used as destination IPv6 address of subsequent IPv4-in-IPv6 messages.


4.  AFTR Bypass Procedure

4.1.  Overview

   Each CPE (which embeds a B4 function) is notified of the IPv6
   reachability information of (one of) the available DS-Lite AFTRs
   (e.g., using [I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option]).  In
   addition, the CPE must support at least one encapsulation scheme to
   convey privately-addressed IPv4 traffic into IPv6 datagrams.  The CPE
   behaves as defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

   A dedicated IPv6 prefix (pref6_aftr) is used to convey the traffic
   between AFTR nodes.

   The following configuration tasks should be undertaken:

   o  Each AFTR is provided with an IPv4 address pool (IPv4@) for its
      NAT operations;

   o  An IPv4-Embedded IPv6 prefix [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] is
      also assigned to each AFTR.  This IPv6 prefix embeds the IPv4 net:
      pref6_aftr+IPv4@.

   o  This IPv6 prefix is injected in a routing protocol (IGP/MP-BGP/
      i-BGP, or softwire full mesh is used between AFTRs).  This route
      announcement is assumed to be performed by the AFTR itself or by
      the router which is responsible for redirecting the traffic to a
      AFTR.  When pref6_aftr+IPv4@ is found on routing table, it is used
      as a "hint" to detect that the IPv4 address is provisioned on a
      AFTR device.

   An operational mode to bypass an AFTR is described in Section 4.2.

4.2.  Operational Mode

   IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulated datagrams issued by a CPE are received by
   an AFTR device (Step 1).  This AFTR de-capsulates the datagram and
   retrieves the destination IPv4 address.  Then, it proceeds to a route
   lookup to check whether a route towards "pref6_aftr+destination
   IPv4@" is installed.  If not, it proceeds with traditional NAT

   operations.  Otherwise (i.e., a route is found.  This means that the
   destination is located behind an AFTR), no NAT44 state is
   instantiated by the Source AFTR.  The datagram is then encapsulated
   in IPv6 datagram with an IPv6 destination address equal to
   "pref6_aftr+destination IPv4 @::x" (refer to
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] for more information on how to build
   IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses).

   As for the source IPv6 address of the encapsulated datagram, two
   schemes may be envisaged:

      (1) Maintain the same source IPv6 address as per the datagram
      received from the customer's device.  The deployment of this
      alternative requires the activation of security association to
      secure the exchange between the Source and Target AFTR.  A trust
      relationship must be configured.

      (2) A new extension header (called TEEH for Tunnel Endpoint
      Extension Header, defined in Figure 6) is inserted to indicate
      where to send the response back.  The value of the extension
      header is an IPv6 address of the source CPE (as stored in the
      Source AFTR).

   The datagram is forwarded to the next hop until being delivered to a
   Target AFTR (Step 2).

      - If a NAT entry is instantiated on that AFTR, the datagram is
      processed.  Additionally, the source IPv6 address of the received
      datagram or the content of the TEEH is stored by the AFTR.  This
      information will be used to send back the response.

      In addition to re-writing destination IPv4 address+port (i.e.,
      DNAPT for Destination NAPT), the IPv4 source address and the port
      number are also modified (referred to as SNAPT for Source NAPT).
      The translation of the source IPv4 address is required to avoid
      overlapping private IPv4 addressing in the destination home realm.
      A public IPv4 address belonging to the Target AFTR pool is used to
      enforce SNAPT.  This SNAPT operation does not alter the number of
      sessions that may be maintained by a given AFTR.

      The resulting IPv4 datagram is then encapsulated in IPv6 and
      forwarded to its final destination (i.e., B in Figure 7) (Step 3).

      An AFTR must be configured to accept TEEH only when it is issued
      by other AFTR devices.  A filtering rule based on the source IPv6
      address MAY be configured.

   As for the response, B encapsulates IPv4 traffic in IPv6 datagrams
   that are forwarded to the AFTR as illustrated in Figure 8 and
   Figure 9 (Step 4).  The AFTR then proceeds to NAT operations (both
   DNAPT and SNAPT).  The resulting IPv4 traffic is then encapsulated in
   IPv6 and corresponding IPv6 datagrams are then forwarded to the IPv6
   address of the remote destination as maintained in the NAT tables
   (Step 5).  TEEH may be inserted to indicate the destination IPv6
   address to be used for the subsequent messages (see Figure 8).
   Figure 9 shows the exchanged flows when TEEH is not used.

   For the remaining exchanges, either A uses the IPv6 address of AFTR2
   to send subsequent messages owing to the presence of TEEH option (see
   Figure 8.  The experienced behaviour is illustrated in Figure 10) or
   it uses the default behavior and it sends all IPv4 traffic to its
   attached AFTR1 (as illustrated in Figure 7).

   A CPE must be configured to accept incoming IPv4-in-IPv6 traffic with
   a source address belonging to an IPv6 prefix used to address AFTR
   devices.

   As a result, NAT operations are enforced in one AFTR instead of two
   nodes.  One AFTR is withdrawn from the path.


5.  IANA Considerations

   TBC.


6.  Security Considerations

   B4 element MUST be configured to accept incoming IPv4-in-IPv6
   datagrams not issued by its outbound AFTR.  All deployed AFTRs SHOULD
   share a security association to secure the use of the TEEH option.

Appendix A.  Alternative Solution

   This alternative aims at avoiding two NAT operations without
   withdrawing a AFTR from the path.

   Outbound flow exchanges are illustrated in Figure 11.  Inbound flow
   exchanges are shown in Figure 12.

   IPv6 is used to convey traffic between AFTR nodes.  IPv4-embedded
   IPv6 addresses are used to detect whether the destination is also

   managed by an AFTR.  No NAT state is then instantiated in the Source
   AFTR.  Two AFTR are maintained in the path but only one AFTR
   maintains a NAT state.

   The following steps are followed

   o  Step 1: A encapsulates it IPv4 datagram in IPv6 one and forwards
      the encapsulated IPv4-in-IPv6 datagram to its outbound AFTR.  The
      IPv6 address/FQDN of its outbound AFTR is provisioned using DHCP
      for instance.

   o  Step 2: Once that datagram is received by the AFTR1, its de-
      capsulates it and retrieves the IPv4 datagram.  Moreover, the
      destination IPv4 address is returned.  AFTR1 proceeds to a routing
      look up to check whether a route to pref6_aftr+destination IPv4@
      is installed.  If the answer is positive (i.e., the destination is
      managed by an AFTR), AFTR1 does not proceeds to any NAT44
      operation.  The IPv4 datagram is then encapsulated in an IPv6 ones
      and forwarded to AFTR2 (destination IPv6 address of the
      encapsulated datagram is pref6_aftr+IPv4@).  The source IPv6
      address used by AFTR1 must identify unambiguously A.

   o  Step 3: AFTR2 receives that datagrams.  It de-capsulates the
      received datagram and retrieves the enclosed IPv4 one.  AFTR2
      checks if a NAT state is already instantiated towards the
      destination IPv4 address/port number.  If the answer is positive,
      then it proceeds to DNAPT and SNAPT.  The resulting datagram is
      then forwards to the IPv6 address of B (stored in AFTR2).

   o  Step 4: B replies as per DS-Lite specifications.

   o  Step 5: AFTR2 de-capsulates the received datagrams and proceeds to
      DNAPT and SNAPT.  The resulting IPv4 datagram is then encapsulated
      in an IPv6 one and forwarded to AFTR1.

   o  Step 6: AFTR1 checks its swapping states and forwards the packet
      to A.
