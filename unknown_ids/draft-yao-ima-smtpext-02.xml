<abstract>
<t> 
Internationalized eMail Address (IMA)
includes two parts, the local part and the domain part.
The way email addresses are used by protocols are different from the way domain
names are used. The most critical difference is that emails are
delivered through a chain of peering clients and servers while domain
names are resolved by name servers by looking up their own tables. In
addition to this, email transport protocols
SMTP and ESMTP provide a
negotiation mechanism through which clients can make decisions for
further processing.
So IMA is different
from the internationalized domain name (IDN).
IMA can be solved by exploiting the
negotiation mechanism while IDN can not use the negotiation mechanism.
So IMA should be solved in the mail transport-level using the negotiation mechanism,
which is an architecturally 
desirable approach. This document specifies the use of SMTP extension
for IMA delivery. It also mentions
the backward compatible mechanism for downgrade procedure, as
specified in an associated specification. The protocol proposed here 
is MTA-level solution which is feasible, architecturally more elegant,
and not as difficult to deploy in relevant communities.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
 
<section title="Role of this specification">
<t>An overview document <xref target="IMA-overview"/> specifies the
requirements for, and components of, full internationalization of
electronic mail. 
This document specifies an element of that work, specifically the
definition
of an SMTP extension <xref target="RFC1869"/>
for IMA transport delivery.
</t></section>

<section title="Proposal Context">
<t>
In order to use internationalized email addresses, we need 
to internationalize both the domain part and the local part of 
the email address. Domain part of the email address may be 
internationalized through IDNA [RFC3490]. But the local 
part of the email address still remains as non-internationalized. 
</t>
<t>  
The syntax of Internet email addresses is restricted 
to a subset of 7-bit ASCII  for the domain-part, with a
less-restricted subset for the local-part. These restrictions are
specified
in <xref target="RFC2821"> RFC 2821 </xref>.
To be able to deliver internationalized email through SMTP servers,
we need to upgrade SMTP server to be able to carry IMA.
Since older SMTP servers and the mail-reading clients and other systems
that are downstream 
from them may not be prepared to handle these extended addresses, an
SMTP extension is specified to identify and protect the addressing
mechanism.
</t>
<t>
This specification describes a
change to the email transport mechanism that permits IMA in both 
the envelope and header fields of messages. The
context for the change is described in 
<xref target="IMA-overview"/> and the details of the header changes
are described in <xref target="IMA-utf8header"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Terminology">

<t>The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", and
"MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
<xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

<t>All specialized terms used in this specification are defined in
the IMA overview <xref target="IMA-overview"/> or in
<xref target="RFC2821"/> and <xref target="RFC2822"/>.</t>

<t>This document is being discussed on the IMA mailing list.  See
https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ima
for information about subscribing. The list's archive is at

<section title="Mail Transport-level Protocol">
<section title="Framework for the Internationalization Extension" anchor="framework" >
<t>
The following service extension is defined:
<vspace blankLines="1" />
<list style="numbers">
<t>The name of the SMTP service extension is
"Internationalized Email and Extensions"; </t>
<t>The EHLO keyword value associated with this extension is
"IEmail";</t>
<t>No parameter values are defined for this EHLO keyword value. In
order to permit future (although unanticipated) extensions, the EHLO
response MUST NOT contain any parameters for that keyword. If a
parameter appears, the 
SMTP client that is conformant to this version of this specification
MUST treat the ESMTP response as if the IMA keyword did not appear.
</t>

<t>Two optional parameters are added to the SMTP MAIL and RCPT commands.
The first parameter is named as ALT-ADDRESS. The second is ATOMIC.
The "ALT-ADDRESS" requires an all-ASCII address as a
substitute for the internationalized  
(UTF-8 coded) address that we call the primary address;
you can learn more in <xref target="IMA-overview"/> or <xref target="IMA-downgrading" />.
The value of "ALT-ADDRESS" may be set by sender
or be gotten by using some algorithmic transformation according to the value of "ATOMIC".
The "ATOMIC" has one of two values: y or n.
The parameter "ATOMIC" is designed to assert whether the address is atomic,
which means that the the primary address(IMA) can be safely transformed or converted to
the respect ASCII email address via ACE
(ASCII Compatible Encoding) if the value is 'y' or not if the value is 'n'.
</t>

<t>No additional SMTP verbs are defined by this extension.</t>
<t>Servers offering this extension MUST provide support for, and
announce, the 8BITMIME extension <xref target="RFC1652" />. </t> 
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="The Address Internationalization Service Extension"
      anchor="extension">
<t>An SMTP Server that announces this extension MUST be prepared to
accept a UTF-8 string <xref target="RFC3629" />
in any position in which RFC 2821 specifies that a "mailbox" may
appear. That string must be parsed only as specified in RFC 2821,
i.e., by separating the mailbox into source route, local part and
domain part, using only the characters colon (U+003A), comma (U+002C),
and at-sign (U+0040) as specified there. Once isolated by this
parsing process, the local part MUST be treated as opaque unless the
SMTP Server is the final delivery MTA. Any domain names that are to
be looked up in the DNS MUST be processed into punycode
<xref target="RFC3492" /> form as
specified in IDNA <xref target="RFC3490" /> unless they are already 
in that form. Any domain names that are to be compared
to local strings SHOULD be checked for validity and then MUST be
compared as specified in IDNA.
</t>
<t>An SMTP Client that receives the IMA extension keyword MAY
transmit a mailbox name as an internationalized string in UTF-8 form.
It MAY transmit the domain part of that string in either punycode
(derived from the IDNA process) or UTF-8 form. If it sends the
domain in UTF-8 form, the original SMTP client
SHOULD first verify that the string is valid for a
domain name according to IDNA rules.
As required by RFC 2821, it MUST
not attempt to parse, evaluate, or transform the local part in any
way if the IMA SMTP extension is offered by the server.
If the IMA SMTP extension is not offered by the Server, the
SMTP Client MUST not transmit an internationalized address. Instead,
it MUST either return the message to the user as undeliverable or
replace it with the alternate ASCII address. If it is replaced, 
the replacement MUST be either the
ASCII-only address specified with the ALT-ADDRESS parameter or with an address obtained from
some algorithmic conversions of the primary address that conforms to the syntax rules of RFC 2821.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Extended Mailbox Address Syntax" anchor="syntax" >
<t>RFC 2821, section 4.1.2, defines the syntax of a mailbox as</t>
<figure>
  <artwork><![CDATA[

      Mailbox = Local-part "@" Domain

      Local-part = Dot-string / Quoted-string

<t>
The key changes made by this specification are, informally, to
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
<list  style="symbols">
<t>Change the definition of "sub-domain" to permit either the
definition above or a UTF-8 string representing a DNS label that is
conformant with IDNA 
<xref target="RFC3490" />. That label MUST NOT contain
the characters "@" or ".", even though those characters can normally
be inserted into a DNS label.</t>
<t>Change the definition of "Atom" to permit either the definition above
or a UTF-8 string. That
string MUST NOT contain any of the ASCII characters (either graphics
or controls) that are not permitted in "atext"; it is otherwise
unrestricted.

<t>According to the description above,
define the syntax of an IMA mailbox with ABNF <xref target="RFC2234" /> as</t>

</section>



<section title="The ALT-ADDRESS and ATOMIC parameter"  >
<t>If the IMA extension is offered, the syntax of the SMTP MAIL and
RCPT commands is extended to support both the optional "ALT-ADDRESS" and "ATOMIC"
parameter.
</t>
<t>
The "ALT-ADDRESS" requires an all-ASCII address, which may set by
sender or some algorithmic transformation.
</t>
<t>
The big problem with
applying an ACE to all local-parts is that the sending or converting
system doesn't know if there are data or instructions embedded in the
address that the ACE process would hide.
<xref target="RFC2821"> SMTP </xref> prohibits SMTP relays
from converting local parts because
the level of SMTP relays' knowledge on the structure of local parts is
assumed to be zero. However, we can raise the knowledge level by
supplying additional information. Many human users' email addresses
do not have any embedded structure processed by the final delivery
MTA. In that case, sender can specify that these email addresses are
safe to be converted in predefined way. The final delivery SMTP server
can revert the addresses even though they are as in all ASCII form.
In such cases, a potential recipient might be able to tell 
someone to whom the address is given "it is ok, there is no 
embedded information here and you can convert it to an ACE address
without danger". If the recipient says that, then if the 
sender can pass that assertion along to his or her own 
(originator) MTA and the MTA can pass it down the line, then an 
MTA that needs to do downgrading would know that ACE-encoding is 
safe. The "ATOMIC" parameter is designed for the above aim.
Transmission of local-parts of UTF-8 avoids having 
to deal with the problem. 
</t>
<t>
The use of the ALT-ADDRESS will be according to the following priority
if SMTP servers can not support IMA capability.
If the sender has already set the ALT-ADDRESS value
in spite of the value of ATMOIC, the client SMTP server will use this address
as the email address 
when the SMTP server does the subsequent operations. If the
ALT-ADDRESS value is not set by the sender but the value of ATOMIC is 'y',
the sender SMTP server can apply some algorithmic transformation such as punycode
to the entire local part of IMA; IDNA may also be applied to the domain part of IMA;
these operations will get an ASCII email address for the subsequent
SMTP operations related to the email address.
If the ALT-ADDRESS value is not set by the sender and the value of ATOMIC is 'n' which means
that the local part of IMA can not be converted to the ASCII email address safely,
the email must be bounced
to the original sender. 
</t>
<t>
The suggested algorithmic transformation is punycode if the value of ALT-ADDRESS is not set by
sender and the vallue of ATMOIC is 'y' when SMTP servers can not support IMA.
Since the prefix "xn--" had been used for IDNA, it is better that 
other prefix such as "bq--" is used for the local part of converted version of the primary address to 
avoid the potential confusion.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Additional ESMTP Changes and Clarifications" >
<t>The mail transport process involves addresses ("mailboxes") and
domain names in contexts in addition to the MAIL and RCPT commands and
extended alternatives to them. In general, the rule is that, when RFC
2821 specifies a mailbox, this document expects UTF-8 to be used for
the entire string; when RFC 2821
specifies a domain name, the name should be in punycode form if its
raw form is non-ASCII.</t>

<t>The following subsections list and discuss all of the relevant cases.
</t>
<t>Support and use of this extension requires support for
8BITMIME. It means that 8BITMIME should be advertised
by the IMA capability SMTP server.</t>

<section title="The Initial SMTP Exchange" >
<t> When an SMTP or ESMTP connection is opened, the server sends a
"banner" response consisting of the 220 reply code and some
information. The client then sends the EHLO command. Since the
client cannot know whether the server supports IMA until after 
it receives the response from EHLO, any domain
names that appear in this dialogue, or in responses to EHLO, must be
in hostname form, i.e., internationalized ones must be in punycode
form.</t>
</section>

<section title="Trace Fields" anchor="TraceFields" >
<t>
Internationalized domain names in Received fields should be
transmitted in punycode form. Addresses in "for" clauses need
further examination and might be treated differently depending on
<xref target="IMA-utf8header" />.
The reasoning in the introductory portion of
<xref target="IMA-overview" /> strongly suggests that these addresses
be in UTF-8 form, rather than some specialized encoding.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Mailing List Question"  > 
<t>How a mixture of traditional and internationalized
addresses on a mailing list will
impact message flows, error reports, and delivery notifications in
all plausible combinations of IMA capability and un-capability servers
is still not clear.
This is an issue, which we can delve into 
in detail in the future proposed IEE working group. We will proposed
the detail solution
to it in another document, and do some experiments to find the best solution to it.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Message Header Label"  > 
<t>There is a hot discussion about message header label when SMTP messages are transmitted on wire.
How to identify them and distinguish them from the normal message. Many referred the famous "MIME-Version:1.0"
as the example.
In order to get the robustness in the absence of context, we should 
consider the issue whether or not we need a mechanism(such as self-label) or some indicator to distinguish or recognize
the format of a "stored" message:  new format(i.e. IMA compliant) or old one  (i.e. RFC 822 compliant).
More detailed discussion is needed after the future proposed IEE working group is formed.
</t>
</section>

</section>
</section>


<section title="Potential problems"  > 
 
<section title="Impact to IRI"  > 
<t>The mailto: schema in IRI <xref target="RFC3987" /> may need to be modified when IMA 
is standardized. </t>
</section>
 
 
<section title="POP and IMAP"  > 
<t>While SMTP mainly takes care of the transportation of messages and the 
header fields on wire, 
POP essentially handles the retrieval of mail objects from the server 
by a client. In order to use internationalized user names based on 
IMA for the retrieval of messages from a mail server using the POP 
protocol, a new capability should be introduced following the POP3 
extension mechanism <xref target="RFC2449" />. </t>
<t>IMAP <xref target="RFC3501" /> uses the traditional user name 
which is based on ASCII. IMAP 
should be updated to support the internationalized user names based 
on IMA for the retrieval of messages from a mail server.</t>
</section>


</section>

<section title="Implementation Advice">
<t>
In the absence of this extension, SMTP clients and servers are
constrained to using only those addresses permitted by RFC 2821. The
local parts of those addresses may be made up of any ASCII characters,
although certain of them must be quoted as specified there. It is
notable in an internationalization context that there is a long
history on some systems of using overstruck ASCII characters (a
character, a backspace, and another character) within a quoted string
to approximate non-ASCII characters. This form of
internationalization should be phased out as this extension
becomes widely deployed but backward-compatibility considerations
require that it continue to be supported.

<note title="IESG Note">
  <t>This extension to the POP3 protocol is to be used by a server to express policy descisions taken by the server administrator. It is not an endorsement of implementations of further POP3 extensions generally. It is the general view that the POP3 protocol should stay simple, and for the simple purpose of downloading email from a mail server. If more complicated operations are needed, the IMAP protocol [RFC 2060] should be used. The first paragraph of section 7 should be read very carefully.</t>
