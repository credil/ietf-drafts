      A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated by
      peer-to-peer (P2P) applications used traditionally for
      file-sharing, and more recently for real-time communications and
      live media streaming. Such applications discover a route to each
      other through an overlay network with little knowledge of the
      underlying network topology. As a result, they may choose peers
      based on information deduced from empirical measurements, which
      can lead to suboptimal choices. We refer to this as the
      Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) problem. In this
      draft we present a survey of existing literature on discovering
      topology characteristics.

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>
      A significant part of today's Internet traffic is generated by
      peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, used originally for file
      sharing, and more recently for realtime multimedia
      communications and live media streaming.  P2P applications are
      posing serious challenges to the Internet infrastructure; by
      some estimates, P2P systems are so popular that they make up
      anywhere between 40% to 85% of the entire Internet traffic <xref
      target="Meeker"/>, <xref target="Karag"/>, <xref
      target="Light"/>, <xref target="Linux"/>, <xref
      target="Parker"/>, <xref target="Glasner"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      P2P systems ensure that popular content is replicated at
      multiple instances in the overlay.  But perhaps ironically, a
      peer searching for that content may ignore the topology of the
      latent overlay network and instead select among available
      instances based on information it deduces from empirical
      measurements, which, in some particular situations may lead to
      suboptimal choices.  For example, a shorter round-trip time
      estimation is not indicative of the bandwidth and reliability of
      the underlying links, which have more of an influence than delay
      for large file transfer P2P applications.
    </t>
    <t>
      Most distributed hash tables (DHT) -- the data structure that
      imposes a specific ordering for P2P overlays -- use greedy
      forwarding algorithms to reach their destination, making locally
      optimal decisions that may not turn to be globally optimized
      <xref target="Gummadi-1"/>.  This naturally leads to the
      Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) problem <xref
      target="I-D.marocco-alto-problem-statement"/>: how to best
      provide the topology of the underlying network while at the same
      time allowing the requesting node to use such information to
      effectively reach the node on which the content resides.  Thus,
      it would appear that P2P networks with their application layer
      routing strategies based on overlay topologies are in direct
      competition against the Internet routing and topology.
    </t>
    <t>
      One way to solve the ALTO problem is to build distributed
      application-level services for location and path selection <xref
      target="Francis-1"/>, <xref target="Ng-1"/>, <xref
      target="Dabek-1"/>, <xref target="Costa-1"/>, <xref
      target="Wong-1"/>, <xref target="Madhyastha-1"/>, in order to
      enable peers to estimate their position in the network and to
      efficiently select their neighbors.  Similar solutions have been
      embedded into P2P applications such as Azureus <xref
      target="Azureus"/>.  A slightly different approach is to have
      the Internet service provider (ISP) take a pro-active role in
      the routing of P2P application traffic; the means by which this
      can be achieved have been proposed <xref target="Aggarwal-1"/>,
      <xref target="Xie-1"/>, <xref target="I-D.saucez-idips"/>.
      There is an intrinsic struggle between the layers -- P2P overlay
      and network underlay -- when performing the same service
      (routing), however there are strategies to mitigate this
      dichotomy <xref target="Seetharaman-1"/>.

      The rest of this paper is structured as follows: <xref
      target="survey"/> surveys the existing literature on topology
      estimation and layer interactions.  <xref target="position"/> makes 
      a case for our position on the need for layer cooperation.

  <section title="Survey of Existing Literature"

    <t>
      Gummadi et al. <xref target="Gummadi-1"/> compare popular DHT
      algorithms and besides analyzing their resilience, provide an
      accurate evaluation of how well the logical overlay topology
      maps on the physical network layer.  In their paper, relying
      only on measurements independently performed by overlay nodes
      without the support of additional location information provided
      by external entities, they demonstrate that the most efficient
      algorithms in terms of resilience and proximity performance are
      those based on the simplest geometric concept (i.e. the ring
      geometry, rather than hypercubes, tree structures and butterfly
      networks).
    </t>
    <t>
      Regardless of the geometrical properties of the DHTs involved,
      interactions between application-layer overlays and the
      underlying networks are a rich area of investigation.  The
      available literature in this field can be taxonomixed in two
      categories: using application-level techniques to estimate
      topology and using an infrastructure of some sort.
    </t>

    <section title="Application-Level Topology Estimation"
             anchor="app-level">
      <t>
        In order to provide P2P overlays with topology information
        essential for optimizing node selection, different systems
        have been proposed.
      </t>
      <t>
        Estimating network topology information on the application
        level has been an area of active research. Early work on
        network distance estimation based on clustering by Francis et
        al. <xref target="Francis-1"/> was followed by the
        introduction of network coordinate systems such as GNP by Ng
        et al. <xref target="Ng-1"/>. Network coordinate systems embed
        the network topology in a low-dimensional coordinate space and
        enable network distance estimations based on vector
        distance. Vivaldi <xref target="Dabek-1"/> and PIC <xref
        target="Costa-1"/> propose distributed network coordinate
        systems that do not need landmarks for coordinate
        calculation. Vivaldi is now being used in the popular P2P
        application Azureus <xref target="Azureus"/> and studies
        indicate that it scales well to very large networks <xref
        target="Ledlie-1"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Coordinate systems require the embedding of the Internet
        topology into a coordinate system. This is not always possible
        without errors, which impacts the accuracy of distance
        estimations. For example, it has proved to be difficult to
        embed the triangular inequalities found in Internet path
        distances <xref target="Wang-07"/>. Thus, Meridian <xref
        target="Wong-1"/> abandons the generality of network
        coordinate systems and provides specific distance evaluation
        services.  The Ono project <xref target="Ono"/> take a
        different approach and uses network measurements from
        content-distribution network (CDN) like Akamai to find nearby
        peers <xref target="Su06"/>.  Used as a plugin to the Azureus
        BitTorrent client, Ono provides 31% average download rate
        improvement.
      </t>
      <t>
        Most of the work on estimating topology information focuses on
        predicting network distance in terms of latency and does not
        provide estimates for other metrics such as
        throughput. However, for many P2P applications throughput is
        often more important than latency. iPlane <xref
        target="Madhyastha-1"/> aims at creating an atlas of the
        Internet using measurements that contains information about
        latency, bandwidth, capacity and loss rates.
      </t>
      <t>
        To determine features of the topology, network measurement
        tools, e.g., based on packet dispersion techniques (packet
        pairs and packet trains) as described by Dovrolis et al. in
        <xref target="DRM01"/> can be used. Moreover, methods of
        active network probing or passive traffic monitoring can also
        generate network statistics relating indirectly to performance
        attributes that cannot be directly measured but need to be
        inferred. An extensive study of such techniques that are
        summarized under the notion of network tomography has been
        provided by Coates et al. <xref target="CHNY02"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Joost Video-on-Demand Service uses P2P technology
        to distribute streaming video at a bit rate of about 600 kbit/s
        and higher. In their experimental analysis, Lei et al. <xref
        target="LEI-07"/> conclude that the system is heavily based on a
        media server infrastructure -- in particular for channels with
        lower popularity -- and that a geographical distance based on
        address prefix analysis is considered during the server
        selection. They show that the peer selection process today is
        unlikely based on topology locality. Instead the peer's capacity
        influences the the creation of the peer lists similar to
        BitTorrent: low capacity peers connect mostly with other low
        capacity peers to avoid wasting the high capacity peers
        bandwidth.  
      </t>

    </section>
    <section title="Topology Estimation through Layer Cooperation">
      <t>
        Instead of estimating topology information on the application
        level through distributed measurements, this information could
        be provided by the entities running the physical networks --
        usually ISPs or network operators.  In fact, they have full
        knowledge of the topology of the networks they administer and,
        in order to avoid congestion on critical links, are interested
        in helping applications to optimize the traffic they generate.
        The remainder of this section briefly describes three recently
        proposed solutions that follow such an approach to address the
        ALTO problem.
      </t>
      <section title="P4P Architecture">
        <t>
          The architecture proposed by Xie et al. <xref
          target="Xie-1"/> have been adopted by the DCIA P4P working
          group <xref target="P4P-1"/>, an open group established by
          ISPs, P2P software distributors and technology researchers
          with the dual goal of defining mechanisms to accelerate
          content distribution and optimize utilization of network
          resources.
        </t>
        <t>
          The main role in the P4P architecture is played by servers
          called ``iTrackers'', deployed by network providers and
          accessed by P2P applications (or, in general, by elements of
          the P2P system) in order to make optimal decisions when
          selecting a peer to connect.  An iTracker may offer three
          interfaces:
          <list style="empty"><t></t></list>
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              Info: Allows P2P elements (e.g. peers or trackers) to
              get opaque information associated to an IP address.
              Such information is kept opaque to hide the actual
              network topology, but can be used to compute the network
              distance between IP addresses.
            </t>
            <t>
              Policy: Allows P2P elements to obtain policies and
              guidelines of the network, which specify how a network
              provider would like its networks to be utilized at a
              high level, regardless of P2P applications.
            </t>
            <t>
              Capability: Allows P2P elements to request network
              providers' capabilities.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The P4P architecture is under evaluation with simulations,
          experiments on the PlanetLab distributed testbed and with
          field tests with real users.  Initial simulations and
          PlanetLab experiments results <xref target="P4P-1"/>
          indicate that improvements in BitTorrent download completion
          time and link utilization in the range of 50-70\% are
          possible.  Results observed in field tests conducted with a
          modified version of the software used by the Pando content
          delivery network <xref target="OpenP4P-1"/> show
          improvements in download rate by 23\% and a significant drop
          in data delivery average hop count (from 5.5 to 0.89) in
          certain scenarios.

      </section>
      <section title="Oracle-based ISP-P2P Collaboration"
               anchor="oracle">
        <t>
          The mechanism is fairly simple: a P2P user sends the list of
          potential peers to the oracle hosted by its ISP, which ranks
          such a list based on its local policies.  For instance, the
          ISP can prefer peers within its network, to prevent traffic
          from leaving its network; further, it can pick higher
          bandwidth links, or peers that are geographically closer.
          Once the application has obtained an ordered list, it is up
          to it to establish connections with a number of peers it can
          individually choose, but it has enough information to
          perform an optimal choice.
        </t>
        <t>
          Such a solution has been evaluated with simulations and
          experiments run on the PlanetLab testbed and the results
          show both improvements in content download time and a
          reduction of overall P2P traffic, even when only a subset of
          the applications actually query the oracle to make their
          decisions.

          The IDIPS solution <xref target="I-D.saucez-idips"/> was
          presented during the SHIM6 session of the 71st IETF meeting.
          It is essentially a modified version of the solution
          described in section <xref target="oracle"/>, extended to
          accept lists of source addresses other than destinations in
          order to function also as a back end for protocols like
          SHIM6 and LISP (which aim at optimizing path selection at
          the network layer).  An evaluation performed on IDIPS shows
          that costs for both providing and accessing the service are
          negligible <xref target="Saucez-2"/>.

  <section title="Application-Level Topology Estimation and the ALTO Problem"
           anchor="position">
    <t>
      The application-level techniques described in Section <xref
      target="app-level"/> provide tools for peer-to-peer applications
      to estimate parameters of the underlying network
      topology. Although these techniques can improve application
      performance, there are limitations of what can be achieved by
      operating only on the application level. 
    </t>
    <t>
      Topology estimation techniques use abstractions of the network
      topology which often hide features that would be of interest to
      the application. Network coordinate systems, for example, are
      unable to detect overlay paths shorter than the direct path in
      the Internet topology. However, these paths frequently exist in
      the Internet <xref target="Wang-07"/>. Similarly,
      application-level techniques may not accurately estimate
      topologies with multipath routing.
    </t>
    <t>
      When using network coordinates to estimate topology information
      the underlying assumption is that distance in terms of latency
      determines performance. However, for file sharing and content
      distribution applications there is more to performance than just
      the network latency between nodes. The utility of a long-lived
      data transfer is determined by the throughput of the underlying
      TCP protocol, which depends on the round-trip time as well as
      the loss rate experienced on the corresponding path <xref
      target="PFTK98"/>. Hence, these applications benefit from a
      richer set of topology information that goes beyond latency
      including loss rate, capacity, available bandwidth.
    </t>
    <t>
      Some of the topology estimation techniques used by peer-to-peer
      applications need time to converge to a result. For example,
      current BitTorrent clients implement local, passive traffic
      measurements and a tit-for-tat bandwidth reciprocity mechanism
      to optimize peering selection at a local level. Peers eventually
      settle on a set of neighbors that maximizes their download rate
      but because peers cannot reason about the value of neighbors
      without actively exchanging data with them and the number of
      concurrent data transfers is limited (typically to 5-7),
      convergence is delayed and easily can be sub-optimal.
    </t>
    <t>
      Skype's P2P VoIP application chooses a relay node in cases where
      two peers are behind NATs and cannot connect directly. Ren et
      al. <xref target="REN-06"/> measured that the relay selection
      mechanism of Skype is (1) not able to discover the best possible
      relay nodes in terms of minimum RTT (2) requires a long setup
      and stabilization time, which degrades the end user experience
      (3) is creating a non-negligible amount of overhead traffic due
      to probing a large number of nodes. They further showed that the
      quality of the relay paths could be improved when the underlying
      network AS topology is considered.
    </t>
    <t>
      Some features of the network topology are hard to infer through
      application-level techniques and it may not be possible to infer
      them at all. An example for such a features are service provider
      policies and preferences such as the state and cost associated
      with interdomain peering and transit links.  Another example is
      the traffic engineering policy of a service provider, which may
      counteract the routing objective of the overlay network leading
      to a poor overall performance <xref target="Seetharaman-1"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      Finally, application-level techniques often require applications
      to perform measurements on the topology. These measurements
      create traffic overhead, in particular, if measurements are
      performed individually by all applications interested in
      estimating topology.
    </t>
<!--
    <t>
      Given these problems of application-level topology estimation
      techniques we argue that a better solution involves the
      cooperation between network and application layer.

  <section title="Open Research Issues"
           anchor="research">
    <t>
      We believe that there are sizable open research issues to tackle
      in an infrastructure-based approach to traffic optimization.
      The following is not an exhaustive list, but a representative
      sample of the pertinent issues.
    </t>
    <t>
      Co-ordinate estimation or path latencies? Despite the many
      solutions that have been proposed for providing applications
      with topology information in a fully distributed manner, there
      is currently an ongoing debate in the research community whether
      such solutions should focus on estimating nodes' coordinates or
      path latencies.  Such a debate has recently been fed by studies
      showing that the triangle inequality on which coordinate systems
      are based is often proved false in the Internet <xref
      target="Wang-07"/>.  Proposed systems following both approaches
      -- in particular, Vivaldi <xref target="Dabek-1"/> and PIC <xref
      target="Costa-1"/> following the former, Meridian <xref
      target="Wong-1"/> and iPlane <xref target="Madhyastha-1"/> the
      latter -- have been simulated, implemented and studied in
      real-world trials, each one showing different points of strength
      and weaknesses.  Concentrated work will be needed to determine
      which of the two solutions will be conducive to the ALTO
      problem.
    </t>
    <t>
      Malicious nodes. Another open issue common in most distributed
      environments consisting of a large number of peers is the
      resistance against malicious nodes.  Security mechanisms to
      identify misbehavior are based on triangle inequality checks
      <xref target="Costa-1"/>, which however tend to fail and thus
      return false positives in presence of measurement inaccuracies
      induced, for example, by traffic fluctuations that occur quite
      often in large networks <xref target="Ledlie-1"/>, <xref
      target="Wang-07"/>.  Beyond the issue of using triangle
      inequality checks, authoritatively authenticating the identity
      of an oracle, and preventing an oracle from attacks are also
      important.  Exploration of existing techniques -- such as public
      key infrastructure or identity-based encryption for
      authenticating the identity and the use of secure multi-party
      computation techniques to prevent an oracle from collusion
      attacks -- need to be studied for judicious use in ALTO-type of
      solutions.
    </t>
    <t>
      Information integrity. Similarly, even in controlled
      architectures deployed by network operators where system
      elements may be authenticated <xref target="Xie-1"/>, <xref
      target="Aggarwal-1"/>, <xref target="I-D.saucez-idips"/>, it is
      still possible that the information returned to applications is
      deliberately altered, for example, assigning higher priority to
      cheap (monetary-wise) links instead of neutrally applying
      proximity criteria.  What are the effects of such deliberate
      alterations if multiple peers collude to determine a different
      route to the target, one that is not provided by an oracle?
      Similarly, what are the consequences if an oracle targets a
      particular node in another AS by redirecting an inordinate
      number querying peers to it causing, essentially, a DDoS attack
      on the node?  Furthermore, does an oracle broadcast or
      multi-cast a response to a query?  If so, techniques to protect
      the confidentiality of the multi-cast stream will need to be
      investigated to thwart ``free riding'' peers.

      Simulate or build? Much debate in the P2P research community
      clusters around the simulate or build question.  Undoubtedly, it
      is hard to foresee how proposed systems would perform in the
      Internet.  Simulations and testbed emulations are in most cases
      the only options available on benchmarking the performance of
      the system.  However these have often proved to be inadequate --
      in at least one particular case <xref target="Ledlie-1"/>, they
      have only provided a rough optimistic approximations of what
      would be measured in the real world.  Even using near-realistic
      testbeds such as PlanetLab do not suffice for certain aspects of
      quantifying P2P traffic: more often, these testbeds do not take
      in account the user component, which is crucial for file-sharing
      P2P systems.  After all, a P2P system depends on the choices and
      interests of its users to fetch, store, and disseminate content
      and it is hard to simulate a sizable user population with
      varying tastes to authoritatively observe the behavior of a P2P
      network.  New techniques in simulation or testbed usage would
      need to be investigated.

      Richness of topological information. Many systems already use
      RTT to account for delay when establishing connections with
      peers (e.g., CAN, Bamboo).  An operator can provide not only the
      the delay metric but other metrics that the peer cannot figure
      out on its own.  These metrics may include the characteristics
      of the access links to other peers, bandwidth available to peers
      (based on operator's engineering of its network), network
      policies, and preferences such as state and cost associated with
      intradomain peering links, and so on.  Exactly what kinds of
      metrics can an operator provide to stabilize the network
      throughput will also need to be investigated.
    </t>
    <t>
      Applicability of ALTO to centralized or semi-centralized
      services. The Joost Video-on-Demand Service uses P2P technology
      to distribute streaming video at a bit rate of about 600 kbit/s
      and higher. In their experimental analysis, Lei et al. <xref
      target="LEI-07"/> conclude that the system is heavily based on a
      media server infrastructure -- in particular for channels with
      lower popularity -- and that a geographical distance based on
      address prefix analysis is considered during the server
      selection. They show that the peer selection process today is
      unlikely based on topology locality. Instead the peer's capacity
      influences the the creation of the peer lists similar to
      BitTorrent: low capacity peers connect mostly with other low
      capacity peers to avoid wasting the high capacity peers
      bandwidth.  It remains to be seen whether an ALTO-type of
      solution can be conducive to a hybrid media-server assisted P2P
      system.
