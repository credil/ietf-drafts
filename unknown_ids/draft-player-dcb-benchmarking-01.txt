Bridge Out: Benchmarking Methodology Extensions for Data Center Bridging
                                Devices
                  draft-player-dcb-benchmarking-01.txt

Abstract

   Existing benchmarking methodologies are based on the assumption that
   networking devices will drop network traffic at their performance
   limits.  Data Center Bridging (DCB) devices, however, will attempt to
   throttle network endpoints before those limits are reached in order
   to minimize the probability of frame loss in the network.  Hence,
   existing methodologies based around frame loss are inappropriate for
   DCB devices.  This document takes the basic benchmarking ideas based
   on loss and extends them to support "lossless" Ethernet devices.

Internet-Draft              DCB Benchmarking                  March 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document is intended to provide a methodology for benchmarking
   Data Center Bridging (DCB) devices that support Priority-based Flow
   Control (PFC).  It extends the methodologies already defined in
   [RFC2544] and [RFC2889].

   This memo primarily deals with devices which use Priority-based Flow
   Control, as defined in IEEE specification 802.1Qbb, to actively
   manage the transmission rate of network endpoints in order to
   minimize forwarding delay and frame loss.


2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   As the terminology used by [RFC4689] is specific to IP layer testing,
   a number of existing terms require clarification when used in the DCB
   benchmarking context.  Additionally, a number of new terms are also
   presented to clarify concepts not clearly defined within the scope of
   [RFC4689].

      Classification: As stated in [RFC4689], Classification is the
      selection of packets according to defined rules.  In the context
      of DCB benchmarking, the Classification criterion is the value of
      the 802.1p priority code point field in the 802.1Q VLAN header of
      an Ethernet frame.

      Classification Group: A collection of traffic streams that belong
      to a single Classification.  A Conformance Vector MAY be
      associated with a Classification Group.

      Classification Profile: The set of all Classification Groups
      involved in a benchmarking test.

      Conformance Vector: A set of measurable stream result bounds, e.g.
      latency, jitter, sequencing, etc., that specify whether a frame is
      Conformant or Non-conformant.  Conformance vectors are optional
      for all DCB benchmarking tests.

      Congestion Management: In the context of DCB benchmarking,
      Congestion Management occurs when the DUT/SUT transmits Priority-

Internet-Draft              DCB Benchmarking                  March 2010


      based Flow Control (PFC) Pause frames.

      Forwarding Congestion: In the context of DCB benchmarking,
      Forwarding Congestion is extended to include the observation of
      PFC pause frame transmissions from the DUT.

      Intended Load: In this document, the Intended Load refers to the
      summation of the Intended Vectors for all Classification Groups.

      Offered Load: In this document, the Offered Load refers to the
      summation of the Offered Vectors for all Classification Groups.

      Queue Congestion: Queue congestion occurs when a DUT/SUT uses
      Congestion Management on a set of traffic Classifications.  The
      congestion Classifications correspond to the congested queues in
      the DUT/SUT.

      Queueput: The maximum Offered Load than can be transmitted into a
      DUT/SUT such that every transmitted frame matches a specific
      Classification rule, the DUT/SUT does NOT use priority-based flow
      control mechanisms to manage the ingress traffic rate of the
      Classification(s) of interest, and all ingress frames are
      forwarded to the correct egress port.  A DUT may have a different
      Queueput value for each configured Classification.


4.  General Considerations

4.1.  Test Traffic

   The lock-step traffic pattern, as described in section 5.1.3 of
   [RFC2889], is specifically NOT required for DCB testing for two
   reasons:

   1.  Such patterns are not meaningful for high speed Ethernet devices
       due to the transmission clock variance allowed by the IEEE 802.3
       Ethernet specification.

   2.  Flow control mechanisms would quickly break such patterns when
       activated.

4.2.  Frame Formats and Tester Capabilities

   This testing document does not mandate the use of any particular
   frame format for testing.  Any frame that can be legally forwarded by
   the DUT/SUT MAY be used provided that the test instrument can make
   the following distinctions for each frame:




Newman & Player        Expires September 10, 2010               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              DCB Benchmarking                  March 2010


   1.  The test tool MUST be able to distinguish test frames from non-
       test frames.

   2.  The test tool MUST be able to determine whether each test frame
       is forwarded to the correct egress port.

   3.  The test tool MUST be able to determine whether each received
       frame conforms or does not conform to the Conformance Vector of
       the frame's Classification Group, if applicable.


5.  Test Setup

   This document extends the general test setup described in section 3
   of [RFC2889] and section 6 of [RFC2544] to the benchmarking of Data
   Center Ethernet switching devices.  [RFC2889] and [RFC2544] describe
   benchmarking methodologies for networking devices that intentionally
   drop frames at their performance limits.  In DCB networks, the DUT
   will transmit PFC Pause frames as a Congestion Management method to
   throttle network endpoints, thus minimizing the probability of frame
   loss in the network.

5.1.  Test Traffic

5.1.1.  Traffic Classification

   Since DCB devices are expected to support multiple traffic
   Classifications, it is RECOMMENDED to benchmark DCB devices with
   multiple Classification Groups.

5.1.2.  Trial Duration

   The RECOMMENDED trial duration is 300 seconds.  However other
   durations MAY be used.  Additionally, a running trial MAY be aborted
   once the test tool determines that the currently running trial has
   failed, e.g.  QoS bounds exceeded, packet loss detected on a lossless
   queue, etc.

5.1.3.  Frame Measurements

   Packet Conformance MUST be determined for all test frames on a per
   frame basis.  The method specified for measuring Latency in
   [RFC2544], e.g. measuring the latency of a single test frame in a
   traffic flow, is unsuitable for DCB benchmarking.

Internet-Draft              DCB Benchmarking                  March 2010


5.1.3.1.  Forwarding Delay and Latency

   Multiple methods exist for measuring the time it takes a test frame
   to be forwarded by a DUT.  However, both of the methods discussed in
   [RFC1242] are unsuitable for testing DCB devices, as many DCB devices
   alternate between both "store and forwarding" and "bit forwarding"
   behavior depending upon their queue congestion.  Hence, the only
   RECOMMENDED method for measuring the time it takes a DUT to forward a
   test frame is "Forwarding Delay" as described in [RFC4689].

5.1.4.  Frame Sizes

5.1.4.1.  Ethernet

   The recommended frame sizes for Ethernet testing are 64, 128, 256,
   512, 1024, 1280, 1518, 4096, 8192, and 9216 as per [RFC5180].  Note
   that these frame sizes include the Ethernet CRC and VLAN header.

5.1.4.1.1.  Fiber Channel over Ethernet

   FCoE test traffic introduces a number of frame size constraints that
   make the default frame sizes specified in [RFC5180] unusable:

   1.  FCoE frames contain an encapsulated Fiber Channel frame.  Due to
       the method of encapsulation used, all FCoE frames MUST be a
       multiple of 4 bytes.  See [RFC3643].

   2.  Test tools may need to include a test payload in addition to the
       encapsulated Fiber Channel frame in order to meet the
       requirements specified in Section 4.2.

   3.  The maximum supported frame size for FCoE is 2176 bytes.

   Due to these constraints, the recommended frame sizes for FCoE
   testing are 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1280, 1520, 2176, and the smallest
   FCoE frame size supported by the test tool.  Note that these frame
   sizes include both the Ethernet CRC and VLAN header.

5.1.5.  Burst Sizes

   As per [RFC2285], the burst size specifies the number of test frames
   in a burst.  To simulate bursty traffic, the test tool MAY send a
   burst of test traffic with the minimum, legal Inter-Frame Gap (IFG)
   between frames in the burst followed by a larger Inter-Burst Gap
   (IBG) between sequential bursts.  Note that burst sizes are only
   applicable to test traffic when the Offered Load of the test ports is
   less than the Maximum Offered Load (MOL) of those ports.
   Additionally, a burst size of 1 specifies a constant load, e.g. non-

   bursty traffic.


6.  Benchmarking Tests

6.1.  Queueput

6.1.1.  Objective

   To determine the Queueput for one or more Traffic Classifications of
   a DUT using priority flow control.

6.1.2.  Setup Parameters

   The following parameters MUST be defined.  Each variable is
   configured with the following considerations.

      Each Classification Group MUST be listed.  For each classification
      group, the following parameters MUST be specified:

         Codepoint - For DCB tests, the codepoint is the VLAN priority.

         Frame Size - The frame size includes both the CRC and VLAN
         header.  See Section 5.1.4 for recommended frame sizes.

         Burst Size - The burst size specifies the number of frames
         transmitted with the minimum legal IFG before pausing.  See
         Section 5.1.5.

         Intended Vector - The intended vector SHOULD specify the
         intended rate of test traffic specified as a percentage of port
         load.

         Conformance Vector - The conformance vector is optional, but
         MUST be defined if used.

      Priority-based Flow Control - PFC mechanisms MUST be enabled.

      Background Traffic - Background traffic MAY be present.

6.1.3.  Procedure

   A search algorithm is used to determine the Queueput for each
   Classification Group.  If Queue Congestion is detected for a
   Classification Group during a trial, then the Intended Vector for the
   Classification Group MUST be reduced for the subsequent trial.  If a
   Conformance Vector is specified for the test and Non-conformant
   frames are received during a trial, then the Intended Vector SHOULD

Internet-Draft              DCB Benchmarking                  March 2010


   be reduced for the subsequent trial.  The algorithm MUST adjust the
   Intended Vector for each Classification Group.  The search algorithms
   for each Classification Group MAY be run in parallel.  The test
   continues until all Classification Groups in the test have converged
   on a discrete Queueput value.

6.1.4.  Measurements

   point in the Codepoint Set MUST be reported.

   The total pause time observed by the tester for each code-point in
   the Codepoint Set MUST be reported.

6.1.5.  Reporting Format

   TBD

6.2.  Maximum Forwarding Rate

6.2.1.  Objective

   To determine the maximum forwarding rate of one or more PFC queues on
   a PFC capable DUT.

6.2.2.  Setup Parameters

   [RFC2285] but works on a per-Classification basis in a DCB context.
   The following parameters MUST be defined.  Each variable is
   configured with the following considerations.

      Each Classification Group MUST be listed.  For each classification
      group, the following parameters MUST be specified:

         Codepoint - For DCB tests, the codepoint is the VLAN priority.

         Frame Size - The frame size includes both the CRC and VLAN
         header.  See Section 5.1.4 for recommended frame sizes.

         Burst Size - The burst size specifies the number of frames
         transmitted with the minimum legal IFG before pausing.  See

         Section 5.1.5.

         Intended Vector - The intended vector includes the intended
         rate of test traffic specified as a percentage of port load.

         Conformance Vector - The conformance vector is optional, but
         MUST be defined if used.

      Priority-based Flow Control - PFC mechanisms SHOULD be disabled.

      Background Traffic - Background traffic MAY be present.

6.2.3.  Procedure

   The tester should iterate across all configured permutations of frame
   size, burst size, and Intended Vector for all Classification Groups.

6.2.4.  Measurements

   The forwarding rate of each Classification Group MUST be reported as
   the number of N-octet test frames per second the DUT correctly
   forwards to the proper egress port.

   The maximum forwarding rate for each Classification Group MUST be
   reported as the highest recorded forwarding rate from the set of all
   iterations.

   Both the Intended and Offered Vector of each Classification Group
   MUST be reported.

   If a Conformance Vector is specified for a Classification Group, any
   Non-conformant frames MUST be reported.

   The number of PFC pause frames transmitted by the DUT for each code-
   point in the Codepoint Set MUST be reported.

   The total pause time observed by the tester for each code-point in
   the Codepoint Set MUST be reported.

6.3.1.  Objective

   To determine the delta between the maximum forwarding rate of a DUT
   and the point where the DUT ceases to use PFC to manage priority
   queues.

6.3.2.  Setup Parameters

   The following parameters MUST be defined.  Each variable is
   configured with the following considerations.

      Each Classification Group MUST be listed.  For each classification
      group, the following parameters MUST be specified:

         Codepoint - For DCB tests, the codepoint is the VLAN priority.

         Frame Size - The frame size includes both the CRC and VLAN
         header.  See Section 5.1.4 for recommended frame sizes.

         Burst Size - The burst size specifies the number of frames
         transmitted with the minimum legal IFG before pausing.  See
         Section 5.1.5.

         Intended Vector - The intended vector includes the intended
         rate of test traffic specified as a percentage of port load.

         Conformance Vector - The conformance vector is optional, but
         MUST be defined if used.

      Priority-based Flow Control - PFC mechanisms MUST be enabled.

      Backoff method - The recommended backoff method is to reduce the
      aggregate traffic load by a fixed amount while still maintaining a
      fixed load ratio between all Classification Groups.

6.3.3.  Procedure

   The initial trial SHOULD begin with an Intended Load equal to or
   greater than the Maximum Forwarding Rate of the DUT/SUT.  For each
   subsequent trial, the aggregate load is reduced until the DUT is
   observed to complete a trial without activating any Congestion
   Management methods.

6.3.4.  Measurements

   The Intended and Offered Vector for each Classification Group MUST be
   reported.

   configured with the following considerations

      Each Classification Group MUST be listed.  For each classification
      group, the following parameters MUST be specified:

         Codepoint - For DCB tests, the codepoint is the VLAN priority.

         Frame Size - The frame size includes both the CRC and VLAN
         header.  See Section 5.1.4 for recommended frame sizes.

         Intended Vector - The intended vector includes the intended
         rate of test traffic specified as a percentage of port load.

         Conformance Vector - The conformance vector is optional, but
         MUST be defined if used.

      Priority-based Flow Control - PFC mechanisms MUST be enabled.

      The sum of all Intended Vectors on a transmitting port SHOULD
      equal the Maximum Offered Load (MOL) of that port.

6.4.3.  Procedure

   A search algorithm is used to determine the maximum duration in
   seconds for which the configured Classification Profile can be
   forwarded by the DUT without active Congestion Management.  If
   Congestion Management is detected during an iteration, then the
   duration MUST be reduced for the next iteration.

6.4.4.  Measurements

   The Intended and Offered Vector for each Classification Group MUST be
   reported.

   If a Conformance Vector is specified for a Classification Group, any
   Non-conformant frames MUST be reported.

   The number of PFC pause frames transmitted by the DUT for each code-
   point in the Codepoint Set MUST be reported.

   The total pause time observed by the tester for each code-point in
   the Codepoint Set MUST be reported.

6.4.5.  Reporting Format

   TBD


7.  Security Considerations

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
   environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints
   specified in the sections above.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.

   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for
   benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network security arising
   from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production
   networks.

8.  IANA Consdierations

   Testers SHOULD use network addresses assigned by IANA for the purpose
   of testing networks.
