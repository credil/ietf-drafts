Abstract

   A new flexible wavelength grid ("flexi-grid") is being developed
   within the ITU-T Study Group 15 to allow selection and switching of
   individual lambdas chosen flexibly from a detailed, fine granularity
   grid of available wavelengths.  This document updates the definition
   of GMPLS lambda labels to support the flexi-grid.

   This document updates RFC 3471 and updates RFC 6205.

1.  Introduction

   As described in [RFC3945], GMPLS extends MPLS from supporting only
   Packet Switching Capable (PSC) interfaces and switching to also
   support four new classes of interfaces and switching that include
   Lambda Switch Capable (LSC).

   A functional description of the extensions to MPLS signaling needed
   to support this new class of interface and switching is provided in
   [RFC3471].

   [RFC3471] states that wavelength labels "only have significance
   between two neighbors" (Section 3.2.1.1); global wavelength semantics
   are not considered.  [RFC6205] defines a standard lambda label format
   which is compliant with both the Dense Wavelength Division
   Multiplexing (DWDM) grid [G.694.1] and the Coarse Wavelength Division
   Multiplexing (CWDM) grid [G.694.2].

   A new "flexi-grid" is being developed within the ITU-T Study Group 15
   to allow selection and switching of individual lambdas chosen
   flexibly from a detailed, fine granularity grid of available
   wavelengths [G.FLEXIGRID].  This document updates the definition of
   GMPLS lambda labels provided in [RFC6205] to support the flexi-grid.

   This document will not be put forward for publication as an RFC
   before the ITU-T have completed technical development of
   [G.FLEXIGRID], and the encoding specified in this document will also
   be communicated to the ITU-T for comment before publication as an
   RFC.

2.  Overview of Flexi-Grid

   [G.FLEXIGRID] extends DWDM fixed grids as defined in [G.694.1] to
   add support for flexible grids. The basis of the work is to allow
   a data channel to be formed from an abstract grid anchored at
   193.1 THz and selected on a channel spacing of 6.25 GHz with a
   variable slot width measured in units of 12.5 GHz. Individual
   allocations may be made on this basis from anywhere in the spectrum,
   subject to allocations not overlapping.

3.  Fixed Grid Lambda Label Encoding

   [RFC6205] defines an encoding for a global semantic for a DWDM label
   based on four fields:

   - Grid: used to select which grid the lambda is selected from.
     Values defined in [RFC6205] identify DWDM [G.694.1] and CWDM
     [G.694.2].

   - C.S. (Channel Spacing): used to indicate the channel spacing.
     [RFC6205] defines values to represent spacing of 100, 50, 25 and
     12.5 GHz.

   - Identifier: a local-scoped integer used to distinguish different
     lasers (in one node) when they can transmit the same frequency
     lambda.

   - n: a two's-complement integer to take either a positive, negative,
     or zero value.  This value is used to compute the frequency as
     defined in [RFC6205] and based on [G.694.1].  The use of n is
     repeated here for ease of reading.

        Frequency (THz) = 193.1 THz + n * channel spacing (THz)

4.  Flexi-Label Encoding

   This document defines a new generalized label encoding for use in
   flexi-grid systems. As with all other GMPLS lambda labels, the use of
   this label is known a priori. That is, since the interpretation of
   all lambda labels is determined hop-by-hop, the use of this label
   requires that all nodes on the path expect to use this label.

   For convenience, however, the label is modeled on the fixed grid
   label defined in [RFC6205] and briefly described in Section 3.

   Figure 1 shows the format of the Flexi-Label. It is a 64 bit label.

[Editors' note: We considered the possibility of having a 40 bit label
with no reserved bits, or a 48 bit label with 8 reserved bits. This
would be somewhat more efficient for objects that carry multiple labels
encoded as a sequence. However, since most uses of the label are in
objects where the label is padded to a 32 bit boundary, there seemed
little benefit.]

         Slot Width (GHz) = 12.5 GHz * m

   The practical range of values for m is from 1 to 8 for slot widths
   ranging from 12.5 GHz to 100 GHz. Wider slot widths may be considered

   with larger values of m.

   The Reserved field MUST be set to zero on transmission and SHOULD be
   ignored on receipt.

   An implementation that wishes to use the flexi-grid MUST follow the
   procedures of [RFC3473] and of [RFC3471] as updated by [RFC6205]. It
   MUST set Grid to 3 and C.S. to 5. It MUST set Identifier to indicate
   the local identifier of the laser in use as described in [RFC6205].
   It MUST also set n according to the formula in Section 3 (inherited
   unchanged from [RFC6205]).  Finally,the implementation MUST set m as
   described in the formula stated above.

5.  Manageability Considerations

   This document introduces no new elements for management. That is,
   labels will continue to be used in the same way by the GMPLS
   protocols and lambda labels have the same fields as previously
   defined so any management tools defined to handle [RFC6205] labels
   will be able to handle labels as specified in this document. However,
   it is obvious that the management tools will have to interpret the
   new values and meanings of label fields as defined in this document,
   and management tools that may have been (unwisely) coded to expect
   all lambda labels to be 32 bits, will need to be updated to handle
   these 64 bit labels.

6.  Security Considerations

   [RFC6205] notes that the definition of a new label encoding does not
   introduces any new security considerations to [RFC3471] and
   [RFC3473]. That statement applies equally to this document.

   For a general discussion on MPLS and GMPLS-related security issues,
   see the MPLS/GMPLS security framework [RFC5920].

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" registry that contains several
   subregistries.

7.1.  Grid Subregistry

   IANA is requested to allocate a new entry in this subregistry as

   Considering the network displayed in Figure 2 (reproduced from
   [RFC6205]) it is possible to show an example of LSP setup using the
   lambda labels. The figure shows Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop
   Multiplexers (ROADMs) and Wavelength Cross-Connects (WXCs) that
