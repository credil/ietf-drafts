        Location Configuration Extensions for Policy Management
                    draft-ietf-geopriv-policy-uri-00

Abstract

   Current location configuration protocols are capable of provisioning
   an Internet host with a location URI that refers to the host's
   location.  These protocols lack a mechanism for the target host to
   inspect or set the privacy rules that are applied to the URIs they
   distribute.  This document extends the current location configuration
   protocols to provide hosts with a reference to the rules that are
   applied to a URI, so that the host can view or set these rules.

Internet-Draft               LCP Policy URIs                January 2011


1.  Introduction

   A critical step in enabling Internet hosts to access location-based
   services is to provision those hosts with information about their own
   location.  This is accomplished via a Location Configuration Protocol
   (LCP) [RFC5687], which allows a location provider (e.g., a local
   access network) to inform a host about its location.

   There are two basic patterns for location configuration, namely
   configuration "by value" and "by reference" [RFC5808].  Configuration
   by value provisions a host directly with its location, by providing
   it location information that is directly usable (e.g., coordinates or
   a civic address).  Configuration by reference provides a host with a
   URI that references the host's location, i.e., one that can be
   dereferenced to obtain the location (by value) of the host.

   In some cases, location by reference offers a few benefits over
   location by value.  From a privacy perspective, the required
   dereference transaction provides a policy enforcement point, so that
   the opaque URI itself can be safely conveyed over untrusted media
   (e.g., SIP through untrusted proxies [RFC5606]).  If the target host
   is mobile, an application provider can use a single reference to
   obtain the location of the host multiple times, saving bandwidth to
   the host.  For some configuration protocols, the location object
   referenced by a location URI provides a much more expressive syntax
   for location values than the configuration protocol itself (e.g.,
   DHCP geodetic location [I-D.ietf-geopriv-rfc3825bis] versus GML in a
   PIDF-LO [RFC4119]).

   From a privacy perspective, however, current LCPs are limited in
   their flexibility, in that they do not provide the Device (the client
   in an LCP) with a way to inform the Location Server with policy for
   how his location information should be handled.  This document
   addresses this gap by defining a simple mechanism for referring to
   and manipulating policy, and by extending current LCPs to carry
   policy references.  Using the mechanisms defined in this document, an
   LCP server (acting for the Location Server) can inform a client as to
   which policy document controls a given location resource, and the LCP
   client (in its Rule Maker role) can inspect this document and modify
   it as necessary.

   The remainder of this document is structured as follows: After
   introducing a few relevant terms, we define policy URIs as a channel
   for referencing, inspecting, and updating policy documents.  We then
   define extensions to the HELD protocol and the DHCP option for
   location by reference to allow these protocols to carry policy URIs.
   Examples are given that demonstrate how policy URIs are carried in
   these protocols and how they can be used by clients.

2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Policy URIs

   A policy URI is an HTTP [RFC2616] URI that identifies a policy
   resource that contains the authorization policy for a linked location
   resource.  Access to the location resource is governed by the
   contents of the authorization policy.

   A policy URI identifies an HTTP resource that a Rule Maker can use to
   inspect and install policy documents that tell a Location Server how
   it should protect the associated location resource.  A policy URI
   always identifies a resource that can be represented as a common-
   policy document [RFC4745] (possibly including some extensions; e.g.,
   for geolocation policy [I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy]).

   Note:  RFC 3693 [RFC3693] identified the Rule Holder role as the one
      that stores policy information.  In this document, the Location
      Server is also a Rule Holder.

3.1.  Policy URI Usage

   A Location Server that is the authority for policy URIs MUST support
   GET, PUT, and DELETE requests to these URIs, in order to allow
   clients to inspect, replace, and delete policy documents.  Clients
   support the three request methods as they desire to perform these
   operations.

   Knowledge of the policy URI can be considered adequate evidence of
   authorization.  A Location Server SHOULD allow all requests, but it
   MAY deny certain requests based on local policy.  For instance, a
   Location Server might allow clients to inspect policy (GET), but not
   to update it (PUT).

   A GET request to a policy URI is a request for the referenced policy
   information.  If the request is authorized, then the Location Server
   sends an HTTP 200 response containing the complete policy identified
   by the URI.

   A PUT request to a policy URI is a request to replace the current
   policy.  The entity-body of a PUT request includes a complete policy
   document.  When a Location Server receives a PUT request, it MUST
   validate the policy document included in the body of the request.  If

Internet-Draft               LCP Policy URIs                January 2011


   the request is valid and authorized, then the Location Server
   replaces the current policy with the policy provided in the request.

   A DELETE request to a policy URI is a request to delete the
   referenced policy document and terminate access to the protected
   resource.  If the request is authorized, then the Location Server
   deletes the policy referenced by the URI and disallows any further
   access to the location resource it governs.

   The Location Server MUST support policy documents in the common-
   policy format [RFC4745], as identified by the MIME media type of
   "application/auth-policy+xml".  The common-policy format MUST be
   provided as the default format in response to GET requests that do
   not include specific "Accept" headers, but content negotiation MAY be
   used to allow for other formats.

   This usage of HTTP is generally compatible with the use of XCAP
   [RFC4825] or WebDAV [RFC4918] to manage policy documents, but this
   document does not define or require the use of these protocols.

3.2.  Policy URI Allocation

   A Location Server creates a policy URI for a specific location
   resource at the time that the location resource is created; that is,
   a policy URI is created at the same time as the location URI that it
   controls.  The URI of the policy resource MUST be different to the
   location URI.

   A policy URI is provided in response to location configuration
   requests.  A policy URI MUST NOT be provided to an entity that is not
   authorized to view or set policy.  This document does not describe
   how policy might be provided to entities other than for location
   configuration. in responses to dereferencing requests
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-deref-protocol] or requests from third parties
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-held-identity-extensions].

   Each location URI has either one policy URI or no policy URI.  The
   initial policy that is referenced by a policy URI MUST be identical
   to the policy that would be applied in the absence of a policy URI.
   A client that does not support policy URIs can continue to use the
   location URI as they would have if no policy URI were provided.

      For DHCP and HELD, the client assumes that the default policy
      grants any requester access to location information, as long as
      the request possesses the location URI.  To ensure that the
      authorization policy is less permissive, a client updates the
      policy prior to distributing the location URI.

Internet-Draft               LCP Policy URIs                January 2011


   A Location Server chooses whether or not to provide a policy URI
   based on local policy.  A HELD-specific extension also allows a
   requester to specifically ask for a policy URI.

   A policy URI is a shared secret between Location Server and its
   clients.  Knowledge of a policy URI is all that is required to
   perform any operations allowed on the policy.  Thus, a policy URI is
   constructed so that it is hard to predict (see Section 8).


4.  Location Configuration Extensions

   Location configuration protocols can provision hosts with location
   URIs that refer to the host's location.  If the target host is to
   control policy on these URIs, it needs a way to access the policy
   that the Location Server uses to guide how it serves location URIs.
   This section defines extensions to LCPs to carry policy URIs that the
   target can use to control access to location resources.

4.1.  HELD

   The HELD protocol [RFC5985] defines a "locationUriSet" element, which
   contain a set of one or more location URIs that reference the same
   resource and share a common access control policy.  The schema in
   Figure 1 defines two extension elements for HELD: an empty
   "requestPolicyUri" element that is added to a location request to
   indicate that a Device desires that a policy URI be allocated; and a
   "policyUri" element that is included in the location response.

 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <xs:schema
      targetNamespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:policy"
      xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
      xmlns:hp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:policy"
      elementFormDefault="qualified" attributeFormDefault="unqualified">

   <xs:element name="requestPolicyUri">
     <xs:complexType name="empty"/>
   </xs:element>

   <xs:element name="policyUri" type="xs:anyURI"/>

 </xs:schema>

                                 Figure 1

   The URI carried in a "policyUri" element refers to the common access
   control policy for location URIs in the location response.  The URI

Internet-Draft               LCP Policy URIs                January 2011


   MUST be a policy URI as described in Section 3.  A policy URI MUST
   use the "http:" or "http:" scheme, and the Location Server MUST
   support the specified operations on the URI.

   A HELD request MAY contain an explicit request for a policy URI.  The
   presence of the "requestPolicyUri" element in a location request
   indicates that a policy URI is desired.

4.2.  DHCP

   The DHCP location by reference option
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-lbyr-uri-option] provides location URIs in
   sub-options called LuriElements.  This document defines a new
   LuriElement type for policy URIs.

   LuriType=TBD   Policy-URI - This is a policy URI that refers to the
              access control policy for the location URIs.

   [NOTE TO IANA/RFC-EDITOR: Please replace TBD above with the assigned
   LuriType value and remove this note]

   A Policy-URI LuriElement uses a UTF-8 character encoding.

   A Policy-URI LuriElement identifies the policy resource for all
   location URIs included in the location URI option.  The URI MUST be a
   policy URI as described in Section 3: It MUST use either the "http:"
   or "https:" scheme, and the Location Server MUST support the
   specified operations on the URI.


5.  Examples

   In this section, we provide some brief illustrations of how policy
   URIs are delivered to target hosts and used by those hosts to manage
   policy.

5.1.  HELD

   A HELD request that explicitly requests the creation of a policy URI
   has the following form:

   <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
     <locationType exact="true">locationURI</locationType>
     <requestPolicyUri
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:policy"/>
   </locationRequest>

   A HELD response providing a single "locationUriSet", containing two

   URIs under a common policy, would have the following form:

   <locationResponse xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
     <locationUriSet expires="2011-01-01T13:00:00.0Z">
       <locationURI>
         https://ls.example.com:9768/357yc6s64ceyoiuy5ax3o
       </locationURI>
       <locationURI>
         sip:9769+357yc6s64ceyoiuy5ax3o@ls.example.com:
       </locationURI>
     </locationUriSet>
     <policyUri xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:policy">
       https://ls.example.com:9768/policy/357lp6f64prlbvhl5nk3b
     </policyUri>
   </locationResponse>

5.2.  DHCP

   A DHCP option providing one of the location URIs and the
   corresponding policy URI from the previous example would have the
   following form:

       0                   1                   2                   3

5.3.  Basic access control policy

   Consider a user that gets the policy URI
   <https://ls.example.com:9768/policy/357lp6f64prlbvhl5nk3b>, as in the
   above LCP example.  The first thing this allows the user to do is
   inspect the default policy that the LS has assigned to this URI:

   GET /policy/357lp6f64prlbvhl5nk3b HTTP/1.1
   Host: ls.example.com:9768


   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-type: application/auth-policy+xml
   Content-length: 388

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <ruleset xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:common-policy"
            xmlns:gp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geolocation-policy">
     <rule id="AA56ia9">
       <conditions>
         <validity>
           <until>2011-01-01T13:00:00.0Z</until>
         </validity>
       </conditions>
       <actions/>
       <transformations>
         <gp:provide-location/>
         <gp:set-retransmission-allowed>
           false
         </gp:set-retransmission-allowed>
         <gp:set-retention-expiry>0</gp:set-retention-expiry>
       </transformations>
     </rule>
   </ruleset>

   This policy allows any requester to obtain location information, as
   long as they know the location URI.  If the user disagrees with this
   policy, and prefers for example, to only provide location to one
   friend, at a city level of granularity, then he can install this
   policy on the Location Server:

      Registrant Contact: IETF, GEOPRIV working group,
      (geopriv@ietf.org), Richard Barnes (rbarnes@bbn.com).

      XML:

         BEGIN
           <?xml version="1.0"?>
           <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
             "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

             </head>
             <body>
               <h1>Namespace for HELD Policy URI Extension</h1>
               <h2>urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:policy</h2>
       [NOTE TO IANA/RFC-EDITOR: Please replace XXXX
       with the RFC number for this specification.]
               <p>See RFCXXXX</p>
             </body>
           </html>
         END

7.2.  XML Schema Registration

   This section registers an XML schema as per the guidelines in
   [RFC3688].

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:geopriv:held:policy

   Registrant Contact:  IETF, GEOPRIV working group (geopriv@ietf.org),

   Schema:  The XML for this schema can be found in Section Section 4.1.

7.3.  DHCP LuriType Registration

   IANA is requested to add a value to the LuriTypes registry, as
   follows:

     +------------+----------------------------------------+-----------+
     |  LuriType  |   Name                                 | Reference |
     +------------+----------------------------------------+-----------+
     |    TBD*    |   Policy-URI                           | RFC XXXX**|
     +------------+----------------------------------------+-----------+

      * TBD is to be replaced with the assigned value
     ** RFC XXXX is to be replaced with this document's RFC number.


8.  Security Considerations

   There are two main classes of risks associated with access control
   policy management: The risk of unauthorized disclosure of the
   protected resource via manipulation of the policy management process,
   and the risk of disclosure of policy information itself.

   Protecting the policy management process from manipulation entails
   two primary requirements: First, the policy URI has to be faithfully
   and confidentially transmitted to the client, and second, the policy
   document has to be faithfully and confidentially transmitted to the
   Location Server.  The mechanism also needs to ensure that only
   authorized entities are able to acquire or alter policy.

8.1.  Integrity and Confidentiality for Authorization Policy Data

   Each LCP ensures integrity and confidentiality through different
   means (see [RFC5985] and [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-lbyr-uri-option]).
   These measures ensure that a policy URI is conveyed to the client
   without modification or interception.

   To protect the integrity and confidentiality of policy data during
   management, the Location Server SHOULD provide policy URIs with the
   "https:" scheme and require the use of HTTP over TLS [RFC2818].  The
   cipher suites required by TLS [RFC5246] provide both integrity
   protection and confidentiality.  If other means of protection are
   available, an "http:" URI MAY be used.

8.2.  Access Control for Authorization Policy

   Access control for the policy resource is based on knowledge of its
   URI.  The URI of a policy resource operates under the same
   constraints as a possession model location URI [RFC5808] and is
   subject to the same constraints:

   o  Knowledge of a policy URI MUST be restricted to authorized Rule
      Makers.  Confidentiality is required for its conveyance in the
      location configuration protocol, and in the requests that are used
      to inspect, change or delete the policy resource.

   o  The Location Server MUST ensure that the URI cannot be easily
      predicted.  The policy URI MUST NOT be derived solely from
      information that might be public, including the Target identity or
      any location URI.  The addition of random entropy increases the
      difficulty of guessing a policy URI.

8.3.  Location URI Allocation

   A policy URI enables the authorization by access control lists model
   [RFC5808] for associated location URIs.  Under this model, it might
   be possible to more widely distribute a location URI, relying on the
   authorization policy to constrain access to location information.

   To allow for wider distribution, authorization by access control
   lists places additional constraints on the construction of location
   URIs.

   If multiple Targets share a location URI, an unauthorized location
   recipient that acquires location URIs for the Targets can determine
   that the Targets are at the same location by comparing location URIs.
   With shared policy URIs, Targets are able to see and modify
   authorization policy for other Targets.

   To allow for the creation of Target-specific authorization policies
   that are adequately privacy-protected, every location URI and policy
   URI that is issued to a different Target MUST be different.  That is,
   no two client can receive the same location URI or policy URI.

   In some deployments it is not always apparent to a LCP server that
   two clients are different.  In particular, where a middlebox
   [RFC3234] exists two or more clients might appear as a single client.
   An example of a deployment scenario of this nature is described in
   [RFC5687].  An LCP server MUST create a different location URI and
   policy URI for every request, unless the requests can be reliably
   identified as being from the same client.
