  LDP Extensions for Optimized MAC Address Withdrawal in VPLS model 3
                     supporting Qualified learning
               draft-chen-l2vpn-vpls-mac-opt-qualified-00

Abstract

   This draft defines a method for optimized MAC Address Withdrawal in
   VPLS model 3 [RFC4664] supporting qualified learning [RFC4762].
   Based on the MAC Address Withdrawal procedures defined in [RFC4762]
   and [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-ldp-mac-opt], some extensions are made to
   enable a PE device to remove only the MAC addresses that belong to
   MAC address space affected by topology change and need to be
   relearned.

Internet-Draft  Optimized MAC Withdrawal in VPLS model 3    October 2010


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4762] defines a basic MAC Address Withdrawal mechanism to remove
   or unlearn MAC addresses for faster convergence on topology change.
   It defines MAC List TLV which contains a list of MAC addresses to be
   flushed in LDP Address Withdraw Message, and when a MAC List TLV
   contains a large number of MAC addresses, it may be preferable to
   send a LDP Address Withdraw Message with an empty MAC List.

   As per the processing rules in [RFC4762], a PE device on receiving a
   MAC Address Withdrawal Message with MAC List TLV removes the
   association between the MAC address and the AC or PW over which this
   message is received.  For a MAC Address Withdraw message with empty
   MAC list, a PE removes all MAC addresses associated with the
   specified VPLS instance (as indicated in the FEC TLV) except the MAC
   addresses learned over the newly activated PW.  The PE device further
   triggers a MAC Address Withdrawal message to each remote PE devices
   connected to it in the VPLS full mesh.  The problem is that it will
   flush MAC addresses which are not affected due to topology change,
   thus leading to unnecessary flooding and relearning.

   Draft [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-ldp-mac-opt] proposes to extend LDP
   protocol to support source initiated P2MP signaling, but it involves
   very few P2MP PW parameter negotiation Mechanism.

   This draft describes the problem and a solution to optimize the MAC
   flush procedure in [RFC4762] and [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-ldp-mac-opt] so
   it flushes only the MAC addresses that belong to MAC address space
   affected by topology change and need to be relearned in VPLS model 3
   supporting Qualified learning.

   There are four VLANs in Figure 1, and each customer VLAN has its own
   broadcast domain and MAC address space.  CE-1 and CE-3 belong to
   VLAN1, CE-2 and CE-4 belong to VLAN2.

   CE-1, CE-2, CE-3 and CE-4 connect with MTU-S, PE-1, PE-4 and PE-2
   respectively.  The MTU-S is dual-homed to PE-1 and PE-2.  Only the
   primary spoke PW is active at MTU-s, thus PE-1 is acting as the
   active device to reach the full mesh in the VPLS instance.

   When MTU-s switches to the backup spoke PW and activates it, PE-2
   becomes the active device to reach the full mesh core.  Traffic
   entering the H-VPLS from CE-1 is diverted by the MTU-s to the backup
   spoke PW.  For faster convergence MTU-s may desire to unlearn or
   remove the MAC addresses belonging to VLAN1 and learned from the PW
   that terminates at PE-1 MUST be removed.  Once the backup PW has been
   made active, MTU-s may send a MAC flush message to PE-2.

   As per the processing rules defined in [RFC4762], PE-2 flushes all of
   the MAC addresses learned in the VPLS from the PWs terminating at
   PE-1, PE-3 and PE-4.  PE-2 further relays MAC flush messages to PE-1,
   PE-3 and PE-4.  Same processing rule applies at all those PE devices.

   As per the processing rules defined in
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-ldp-mac-opt], PE-2 flushes all of the MAC
   addresses learned in the VPLS from the PWs terminating at PE-1.  In
   fact, PE2 need not flush the MAC addresses belong to VLAN2 and
   learned over PW1.There are multi-Mac addresses spaces in a single
   VPLS, and the affected Mac addresses spaces is only VLAN1.  PE-2 only
   need flush and relearn MAC addresses belong to VLAN1 and learned over
   PW1.

   With the number of PE devices in the full-mesh increases, the number
   of unaffected MAC addresses flushed in a VPLS instance also
   increases, thus leading to unnecessary flooding and relearning.


4.  Optimized MAC Flush Mechanism

4.1.   MAC Address Space TLV

   This draft proposes a MAC Address Space TLV to be used with LDP
   Address Withdraw Message.  The MAC Address Space TLV carries a list
   of MAC addresses Spaces which are affected due to topology change.
   When a PE receives a LDP Address Withdraw message with a MAC Address
   Space TLV, then the PE only flushes the suspect MAC addresses belong
   to the MAC Address Space elements.

   The new MAC Address Space TLV format is as follows:

   mechanism used here is targeted, the TLV MUST NOT be forwarded.

4.2.  MAC Address Space TLV Processing Rules

   If a PE device receives a MAC Address Withdraw with MAC Address Space
   TLV and empty MAC list, it SHOULD remove all the MAC addresses
   associated with the MAC Address Spaces (specified by the MAC Address
   Space TLV) in a VPLS instance, except the MAC addresses learned over
   the PW associated with this signaling session over which the message
   was received.

   If a PE device receives a MAC Address Withdraw with MAC Address Space
   TLV and MAC list TLV, it SHOULD remove the MAC address (specified by
   the MAC List TLV) associated with the MAC Address Space (specified by
   the MAC Address Space TLV) in a VPLS instance.

   If a PE device receives a MAC Address Withdraw with MAC Address Space
   TLV and PE-ID TLV, from the specified MAC Address Space which is

   identified by MAC Address Space TLV GBP[not]it SHOULD remove all the
   MAC addresses learned from the PW ,which terminates at the PE
   identified by the PE-ID.

   If a PE device that doesn't support MAC Address Space TLV, receives a
   MAC flush message with this option, it MUST ignore the option and
   follow the processing rules as per [RFC4762] and
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-ldp-mac-opt].

   The scope of a MAC List TLV is the MAC Address Space (specified by
   the MAC Address Space TLV) in the VPLS (specified by the FEC TLV in
   the MAC Address Withdraw Message).

4.3.  Optimized MAC Flush Procedures

   This section explains the optimized MAC flush procedure in the
   scenario shown in Figure.1.

   When the backup PW is activated by MTU-s, it may send MAC Address
   Withdraw message to PE-2 with the FEC TLV and the optional PE-ID TLV
   and MAC Address Space TLV.  The MAC Address Space TLV carries a list
   of MAC addresses Space which are affected due to topology change.
   Upon receipt of the MAC Address Withdraw message, PE-2 identifies the
   VPLS instance that requires MAC Address Withdraw from the FEC element
   in the FEC TLV.  From the PE-ID TLV, PE-2 identifies the PW in the
   VPLS that terminates in PE-1.  From the MAC Address Space TLV, PE-2
   identifies MAC addresses Space which are affected due to topology
   change.  PE-2 removes all MAC addresses belong to VLAN1 and learned
   over PW1.

   PE-2 relays MAC Address Withdraw messages with the received MAC
   Address Space TLV and PE-ID to all its peer PE devices.  When the
   message is received at PE-3/PE-4, MAC addresses belonging to VLAN1
   and learned over the PW that terminates at PE1 MUST be removed.


5.   IANA Considerations

   The type field in the MAC List TLV is defined as 0x406 and is subject
   to IANA approval


6.  Security Considerations

   This section will be added in a future version.
