Abstract

   Port Control Protocol (PCP) Rapid Recovery allows PCP clients to
   repair failed mappings within seconds, rather than the minutes or
   hours it might take if they relied solely on waiting for the next
   routine renewal of the mapping.  Mapping failures may occur when a
   NAT gateway is rebooted and loses its mapping state, or when a NAT
   gateway has its external IP address changed so that its current
   mapping state becomes invalid.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Port Control Protocol [PCP] allows a host to control how incoming
   IPv6 or IPv4 packets are translated and forwarded by a network
   address translator (NAT) or simple firewall to an IPv6 or IPv4 host,
   and also allows a host to optimize its outgoing NAT keepalive
   messages.

   PCP Rapid Recovery allows PCP clients to repair failed mappings
   within seconds, rather than the minutes or hours it might take if
   they relied solely on waiting for the next routine renewal of the
   mapping.  Mapping failures may occur when a NAT gateway is rebooted
   and loses its mapping state, or when a NAT gateway has its external
   IP address changed so that its current mapping state becomes invalid.


3.  PCP Restart Announcement

   When a PCP-enabled NAT gateway [PCP] that implements PCP Rapid
   Recovery reboots, restarts its NAT engine, or otherwise enters a
   state where it may have lost some or all of its previous mapping
   state (or doesn't know whether it may have had prior mapping state
   that it lost) it MUST inform PCP clients of this fact by multicasting
   the UDP packet shown below to 224.0.0.1:5350 on all multicast-capable
   interfaces on which it accepts PCP requests.  To accommodate packet
   loss, the PCP-enabled NAT MAY transmit such packets up to ten times
   (with an appropriate Epoch value in each to reflect the passage of
   time between transmissions) provided that the interval between the
   first two notifications is at least 250ms, and the interval between
   subsequent notification at least doubles.

                 Figure 1: PCP Restart Announcement Packet

   A PCP client that implements PCP Rapid Recovery MUST listen on UDP
   224.0.0.1:5350 on all multicast-capable interfaces on which it has
   sent PCP requests, to receive these PCP Restart Announcements.  (The
   SO_REUSEPORT socket option or equivalent should be used for the
   multicast UDP port, if required by the host OS to permit multiple
   independent listeners on the same multicast UDP port.)  Upon
   receiving a PCP Restart Announcement a PCP client MUST (as it does
   with all received PCP response packets) inspect the Announcement's
   source IP address, and if the Epoch value indicates that the NAT
   gateway has begun a new epoch since the last time the PCP client
   received a PCP response message from that PCP server address, then
   for all PCP mappings it made at that address the client should issue
   new PCP requests to to recreate any lost mapping state.  The use of
   the Suggested External IP Address and Suggested External Port fields
   in the client's renewal request allows the client to remind the
   restarted NAT gateway of what mappings the client had previously been
   given, so that in many cases the prior state can be recreated.  For
   NAT gateways that reboot relatively quickly it is usually possible to
   reconstruct lost mapping state fast enough that existing TCP
   connections and UDP communications do not time out and continue
   without failure.

   The PCP Rapid Recovery capability enables users to, for example,
   connect to remote machines using ssh, and then reboot the NAT gateway
   (or even replace it with completely new hardware) without losing
   their established ssh connections.

   Use of PCP Rapid Recovery is a performance optimization.  Without it,
   PCP clients will still recreate their correct state when they next
   renew their mappings, but this routine self-healing process may take
   hours rather than seconds, and will probably not happen fast enough
   to prevent active TCP connections from timing out.

4.  PCP Mapping Update

   If a PCP-enabled NAT gateway has not forgotten its mapping state, but
   for some other reason has determined that some or all of its mappings
   have become unusable (e.g. when a home gateway is assigned a
   different external IPv4 address by the upstream DHCP server) then the
   NAT gateway MAY chose to remedy this situation by automatically
   repairing its mappings and notifying its clients.

   For PCP MAP mappings, for each one the NAT gateway should update the
   External IP Address and External Port to appropriate available
   values, and then send unicast PCP MAP responses to inform the PCP
   client of the new External IP Address and External Port.  Such MAP
   responses are identical to the MAP responses normally returned in
   response to client MAP requests, except they may be viewed as a long-
   delayed response to an earlier MAP request, containing newly updated
   External IP Address and External Port values.

   To accommodate packet loss, the PCP-enabled NAT MAY transmit such
   packets up to ten times (with an appropriate Epoch value in each to
   reflect the passage of time between transmissions) provided that the
   interval between the first two notifications is at least 250ms, and
   the interval between subsequent notification at least doubles.

   Upon receipt of such long-delayed MAP responses, a PCP client MUST to
   use the information in them to update its DNS records, or other
   address and port information recorded with some kind of application-
   specific rendezvous server.  Existing TCP connections will be lost,
   but promptly updating the DNS or rendezvous server with the new data
   will allow new connections to be made.

   For PCP PEER mappings there is no general way to recover them (the
   remote host doesn't know the new External IP Address and External
   Port) so existing connections will be lost.  Accordingly, a PCP-
   enabled NAT gateway is not required to take any specific action for
   PEER mappings.  It MAY delete all PEER mappings immediately (and let
   application-layer timeouts detect the failure) or it MAY choose to
   retain them for some time in case another change in the external
   environment (e.g. a lost DHCP-assigned external address is re-
   assigned after a few seconds) results in the mappings becoming usable
   again.

5.  Security Considerations

   Forged PCP Restart Announcements could be used to cause high load on
   a PCP server.

   Forged MAP responses could be used to mislead a PCP client about what
   External IP Address and External Port is has been allocated.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to record that UDP port 5350 is now formally
   reallocated from "NAT-PMP Restart Announcement" to "PCP Restart
   Announcement".
