Abstract

   This document provides GMPLS OSPF routing enhancements to support
   signal compatibility constraints associated with WSON network
   elements. These routing enhancements are required in common optical
   or hybrid electro-optical networks where not all of the optical
   signals in the network are compatible with all network elements
   participating in the network.

   This compatibility constraint model is applicable to common optical
   or hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO switches, regenerators,
   and wavelength converters since such systems can be limited to
   processing only certain types of WSON signals.

                1. Introduction

   The documents [WSON-Frame, WSON-Info, RWA-Encode] explain how to
   extend the wavelength switched optical network (WSON) control plane
   to allow both multiple WSON signal types and common hybrid electro
   optical systems as well hybrid systems containing optical switching
   and electro-optical resources. In WSON, not all of the optical
   signals in the network are compatible with all network elements
   participating in the network. Therefore, signal compatibility is an
   important constraint in path computation in a WSON.

   This document provides GMPLS OSPF routing enhancements to support
   signal compatibility constraints associated with general WSON network
   elements. These routing enhancements are required in common optical
   or hybrid electro-optical networks where not all of the optical
   signals in the network are compatible with all network elements
   participating in the network.

   This compatibility constraint model is applicable to common optical
   or hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO switches, regenerators,
   and wavelength converters since such systems can be limited to
   processing only certain types of WSON signals.

       1.1. Revision History

   From 00 to 01: The details of the encodings for compatibility moved
   from this document to [RWA_Encode].

   From 01 to 02: Editorial changes.

   From 02 to 03: Add a new Top Level Node TLV, Optical Node Property
   TLV to carry WSON specific node information.

   From 03 to 04: Add a new sub-TLV, Block Shared Access Wavelength
   Availability TLV to be consistent with [RWA-Encode] and editorial
   changes.

      2. The Optical Node Property TLV

   [RFC 3630] defines OSPF TE LSA using an opaque LSA. This document
   adds a new top level TLV for use in the OSPF TE LSA: the Optical Node
   Property TLV.

Internet-Draft OSPF Enhancement for WSON Signal Compatibility March 2011


   The Optical Node Property TLV contains all WSON-specific node
   properties and signal compatibility constraints. The detailed
   encodings of these properties are defined in [RWA-Encode].

   The following sub-TLVs of the Optical Node Property TLV are defined:

   Value       Length      Sub-TLV Type

   TBA         variable    Resource Block Information
   TBA         variable    Resource Pool Accessibility
   TBA         variable    Resource Block Wavelength Constraints
   TBA         variable    Resource Pool State
   TBA         variable    Block Shared Access Wavelength Availability

   The detail encodings of these sub-TLVs are found in [RWA-Encode] as
   indicated in the table below.

   Sub-TLV Type                           Section[RWA-Encode]

   Resource Block Information                      4.1
   Resource Pool Accessibility                     3.1
   Resource Block Wavelength Constraints           3.2
   Resource Pool State                             3.3
   Block Shared Access Wavelength Availability     3.4


       2.1. Sub-TLV Details

   Among the sub-TLVs defined above, the Resource Pool State sub-TLV is
   dynamic in nature while the rest are static. As such, it will be
   separated out from the rest and make use of multiple TE LSA instances
   per source, per [RFC3630] multiple instance capability.

   2.1.1. Resource Block Information

   Resource Block Information sub-TLVs are used to convey relatively
   static information about individual resource blocks including the
   resource block properties and the number of resources in a block.

   There are seven nested sub-TLVs defined in the Resource Block
   Information sub-TLV.

   Value          Length      Sub-TLV Type

   TBA            variable    Input Modulation Format List
   TBA            variable    Input FEC Type List

   TBA            variable    Input Bit Range List
   TBA            variable    Input Client Signal List
   TBA            variable    Processing Capability List
   TBA            variable    Output Modulation Format List
   TBA            variable    Output FEC Type List


   The detail encodings of these sub-TLVs are found in [RWA-Encode] as
   indicated in the table below.

   Name                             Section[RWA-Encode]

   Input Modulation Format List                 4.2
   Input FEC Type List                          4.3
   Input Bit Range List                         4.4
   Input Client Signal List                     4.5
   Processing Capability List                   4.6
   Output Modulation Format List                4.7
   Output FEC Type List                         4.8

   2.1.2. Resource Pool Accessibility

   This sub-TLV describes the structure of the resource pool in relation
   to the switching device. In particular it indicates the ability of an
   ingress port to reach a resource block and of a resource block to
   reach a particular egress port.

   2.1.3. Resource Block Wavelength Constraints

   Resources, such as wavelength converters, etc., may have a limited
   input or output wavelength ranges. Additionally, due to the structure
   of the optical system not all wavelengths can necessarily reach or
   leave all the resources. Resource Block Wavelength Constraints sub-
   TLV describe these properties.

   2.1.4. Resource Pool State

   This sub-TLV describes the usage state of a resource that can be
   encoded as either a list of 16 bit integer values or a bit map
   indicating whether a single resource is available or in use. This
   information can be relatively dynamic, i.e., can change when a
   connection is established or torn down.

   2.1.5. Block Shared Access Wavelength Availability

   Resources blocks may be accessed via a shared fiber. If this is the
   case then wavelength availability on these shared fibers is needed to
   understand resource availability.


3. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any further security issues other
   than those discussed in [RFC 3630], [RFC 4203].

4. IANA Considerations

   This document introduces a new Top Level Node TLV (Optical Node
   Property TLV) under the OSPF TE LSA defined in [RFC 3630].

   Value    TLV Type

   TBA      Optical Node Property

   IANA is to allocate a new TLV Type and its Value for this Top Level
   Node TLV.

   This document also introduces the following sub-TLVs associated with
   the Optical Node Property TLV as defined in Section 2.1 as follows:

   Value       Length      Sub-TLV Type

   TBA         variable    Resource Block Information
   TBA         variable    Resource Pool Accessibility
   TBA         variable    Resource Block Wavelength Constraints
   TBA         variable    Resource Pool State
   TBA         variable    Block Shared Access Wavelength Availability


   IANA is to allocate new sub-TLV Types and their Values for these sub-
   TLVs defined under the Optical Node Property TLV.



   There are seven nested sub-TLVs defined in the Resource Block
   Information sub-TLV as follows:

   Value          Length      Sub-TLV Type
