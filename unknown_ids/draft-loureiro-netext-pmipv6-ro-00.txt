Abstract

   The IETF specified Proxy Mobile IPv6 as protocol for network-based
   mobility management.  In Proxy Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes are attached
   to the network through Mobility Access Gateways and registered with a
   Local Mobility Anchor.  Traffic from and to the mobile node traverses
   the mobile node's Local Mobility Anchor, irrespective of the location
   of the mobile node's corresponding communication endpoint.  This
   document specifies a protocol extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6 which
   allows the set up and maintenance of an optimized routing path
   between two communicating mobile nodes' Mobility Access Gateways
   without traversing the mobile nodes' Local Mobility Anchor(s).  The
   protocol component of a rendezvous control point ensures stable
   maintenance of routing states during handover in scenarios with
   multiple mobility anchors, where states for the two communication
   endpoints is distributed between these anchors.

Internet-Draft     Proxy Mobile IPv6 Localized Routing         July 2009


1.  Introduction

   The IETF specified Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] as solution
   for network-based mobility management.  In PMIPv6, Mobile Nodes (MNs)
   are registered with a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) maintaining a
   binding between the MN's Home Network Prefix (HNP) and its locator,
   which is represented by the currently used Mobility Access Gateway
   (MAG).  The MAG's IP address serves as Proxy Care-of Address (Proxy
   CoA) and is bound to the MN's HNP.  Downlink packets, which address
   the MN's HNP, are forwarded by the MN's LMA by means of an IP tunnel
   to the MN's current MAG, which terminates the tunnel and delivers the
   packet to the MN by means of link-layer or point-to-point mechanisms.
   Uplink packets are tunneled by the MN's MAG to the LMA and then
   forwarded to the Internet.

   The PMIPv6 architecture implies that all packets being sent or
   received by a MN traverse the associated LMA, irrespective of where
   an MN's correspondent communication endpoint is connected.  In case
   two MNs attach to the same PMIPv6 domain, the routing path for the
   local communication between these nodes may be sub-optimal, as
   packets traverse the MNs' LMA(s) [I-D.liebsch-netext-pmip6-ro-ps].
   This document specifies an extension to PMIPv6 as per [RFC5213] to
   set up a route optimized path and associated routing states for local
   communication between the two MNs' MAGs within a PMIPv6 domain and to
   maintain these routing states during the MNs' handover.

   The specified protocol for localized routing follows the network-
   based mobility management paradigm [RFC4831] and does not require any
   signaling from the MNs to establish an optimized routing path between
   the two MNs' MAGs.  The present protocol is based on
   [I-D.abeille-netlmm-proxymip6ro] and supports reliable set up and
   maintenance of localized routes independent of whether both MNs
   attach to the same or different LMA and MAG.  The protocol relies on
   a route optimization controller (ROC) function, which is associated
   with each LMA.  In case both MNs are registered with different LMAs,
   only one selected LMA takes over the control to maintain states on
   PMIPv6 components during an MN's handover.  Hence, the LMA which
   controls the set up and update of localized routing states represents
   the rendezvous control point for the route update procedure.
   Coordination of the route update procedure from a rendezvous point
   ensures stable maintenance of localized routing during one or both
   MNs' handover without running into race condition situations.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology of RFC 5213 [RFC5213].  The
   following terms are used in the context of this draft:

   o  Mobile Node (MN): Mobile Node without IP mobility support, which
      is attached to a Mobility Access Gateway (MAG) and registered with
      a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) according to the PMIPv6
      specification RFC 5213 [RFC5213]

   o  Correspondent Node (CN) - Correspondent Node with or without IP
      mobility support.  The CN represents the communication peer of an
      MN, which is attached to a MAG and registered with an LMA
      according to the PMIPv6 specification.

   o  Source MN - Mobile Node associated with the LMA that triggers the
      route optimization procedure.

   o  Destination MN - Mobile Node associated with the LMA that receives
      the trigger to initiate the route optimization procedure.

   o  Localized Routing - Result of signaling to set up routing states
      on relevant network entities to allow forwarding of data packets
      between an MN and a CN within a single PMIPv6 domain without
      traversing the MN's LMA and without traversing the CN's mobility
      anchor.

   o  Localized Routing States - Information for localized routing on
      relevant forwarding entities on the optimized data path between an
      MN and a CN.  Such information includes route entries and may
      include further information about the MN and the CN, such as IDs.

   o  RO Trigger - This function is assigned to a network entity, which
      first detects that RO can be established between the MAGs of two
      MNs.

   o  RO Controller - This function is assigned to a network entity for
      the first time RO is set up between a pair of MAGs.  The entity
      which has been selected as active RO controller (receiving a RO
      Trigger) remains anchored as controlling entity for the duration
      of the route optimized communication and the lifetime of
      associated RO states.  It is responsible for coordinating any
      subsequent updates on localized routing states due to movements of
      the MNs.

3.  General Procedure

   According to standard PMIPv6, all traffic generated by an MN attached
   to a MAG is routed through this MAG to the respective LMA.  In the
   case of Figure 1 all traffic from MN1 to MN2 is routed through MAG1
   to LMA1 and then through LMA2 and MAG3 towards MN2.  The detection of
   the possibility to establish a localized path can then be assigned to
   the LMA of MN1 (LMA1) and it may be determined by analyzing the
   source/destination addresses of MN1 and MN2, for example.

   Setting up a localized path in the specific scenario of Figure 1
   requires the assignment of RO Trigger to the LMA that detects that a
   localized path can be established, while the role of RO Controller is
   assigned to the peer LMA.  In the case of both MNs being associated
   to the same LMA and different MAGs, the role of RO Controller and RO
   Trigger is assigned to the same LMA.  The RO Controller coordinates
   the setup of the localized path at the involved MAGs and is also
   responsible for updating the localized routing states in case of
   handover of one of the MNs.

   The specific case of setting up localized routing in the scenario of
   multiple LMAs possibly requires the resolution of a destination MN's
   IP address into the routable IP address of the destination MN's LMA.
   This is due to the fact that, upon traffic inspection and detection
   of possibility of route localization, the LMA will only acquire the
   IP address of both MNs but not the IP address of the peer LMA.  An
   approach to solving this issue is discussed in
   [I-D.liebsch-dime-pmip6-lmaresolve].

   Lifetime refreshing of localized routing states is done independently
   by each MAG at the respective LMA.  For this procedure the MAGs rely
   on timers that, upon expiration, can refresh/remove the localized
   routing state or probe for ongoing traffic on the localized route and
   act accordingly.  This decision can be based on a local configuration
   or policy.

   Two different modes of operation can be supported for the currently
   specified protocol.  The proxy mode, in which messages between MAGs
   are relayed through the LMAs, and the direct mode, in which the MAGs
   are allowed to exchange messages directly at the cost of having to
   setup security associations between them but requiring a smaller
   number of message exchanging to setup the localized paths.  The
   present draft focuses on the direct mode, although future versions of
   the document might consider the specification of the proxy mode.
   Considerations on the proxy mode can be checked in
   [I-D.abeille-netlmm-proxymip6ro].

4.  Protocol Overview

   In order to support the setting up and maintenance of the localized
   routing procedure, this document introduces the following new
   messages:

   o  RO Trigger - This message is sent from an LMA to inform another
      LMA that it must initiate an RO procedure towards a MAG associated
      to it.  It's only used on scenarios with more than one LMA.

   o  RO Trigger Ack - This message is sent from an LMA to inform
      another LMA about the success of the RO path establishment.  It's
      only used on scenarios with more than one LMA.

   o  RO Init - This message is sent from an LMA to a MAG in order to
      inform it that it should setup RO according to the received
      information.  It triggers the MAG to contact the peer MAG in order
      to setup the localized reverse path.

   o  RO Init Ack- This message is sent from MAG to LMA in order to
      inform the status of the RO initiation setup.

   o  RO Setup - This message is sent from MAG to MAG and informs the
      receiving MAG that it should setup an RO path according to the
      received information.

   o  RO Setup Ack - This message is sent from MAG to MAG in order to
      inform the status of the RO setup.

   o  RO Refresh - This message is send from MAG to LMA in order to
      refresh the lifetime of an existing localized routing state.

   o  RO Refresh Ack - This message is sent from LMA to MAG in order to
      inform the status of the lifetime refresh request.

   All the scenarios considered in the following chapters assume that
   traffic is initiated from MN1 towards MN2.

4.1.  Setup of Localized Routing - Single LMA

   For the scenario of Figure 2, two mobile nodes are assumed to be
   registered with the same LMA and associated with different MAGs (MAG1
   and MAG2).  When traffic starts from the mobile node attached to MAG1
   towards the mobile node attached to MAG2, it is detected by LMA1 and
   it triggers route localization.  LMA1 sends a RO Init (1.) message
   immediately to MAG2 because it recognizes that the target mobile node
   is registered to itself so it knows the destination MAG (MAG2).  At
   this point MAG2 starts activating the localized routing states for

   the traffic towards MAG1 and instructs MAG1 to do the same on the
   inverse path by sending RO Setup (2.).  If everything succeeds on the
   side of MAG1 it sends back RO Setup Ack (3.) to MAG2 with a
   successful code and MAG2 finally notifies LMA1 of the completion of
   the procedure by sending RO Init Ack (4.) back to LMA1.  In case of
   failure to setup the forwarding state at MAG2 it should send
   immediately RO Init Ack with a failure code back to LMA1 instead of
   sending RO Setup to MAG1.

              Figure 2: Route Optimization Setup - Single LMA

   Note: For the case of single LMA scenarios, the role of Trigger and
   RO Control is always assigned to the same LMA.

4.2.  Setup of Localized Routing - Multiple LMAs

   In Figure 3, two mobile nodes are registered with different LMAs
   (LMA1 and LMA2) and attached to two different MAGs (MAG1 and MAG2).
   LMA1 detects the possibility of localizing the route and since there
   are currently no associated states it triggers LMA2 by sending RO
   Trigger (1.) and assigns the role of RO Control to LMA2.  The
   remaining of the signaling is similar to Figure 2 with the exception
   that LMA2 must inform LMA1 of the final result of the procedure with
   RO Trigger Ack (6.).

            Figure 3: Route Optimization Setup - Multiple LMAs

4.3.  Maintenance during Handover - Single LMA

   In Figure 4, it is assumed that there is already a localized path
   established between the mobile node attached to pMAG1 and the mobile
   node attached to MAG2, it is also assumed that the MN performs an
   handover to nMAG1.  When LMA1 receives the PBU (1.) from nMAG1 it
   recognizes that there are active route localized states for that
   mobile node that need to be installed at nMAG1 and updated at MAG2,
   so it proceeds to send RO Init (3.) to nMAG1 following the same
   procedure as in Figure 2.  The localized routing states at pMAG1 can
   be left to expire together with the BUL entry or can be explicitly
   deleted if there is a mechanism that allows for MN detachment
   detection.

   Figure 4: Route Optimization Maintenance during Handover - Single LMA

4.4.  Maintenance during Handover - Multiple LMAs

   In Figure 5, it is assumed an already established localized path
   between two MNs that are registered under different LMAs.  Like in
   Figure 4, the MN at pMAG1 will perform an handover to nMAG1.  Upon
   receiving the PBU (1.), LMA1 will recognize the existence of active
   route localized states and therefore informs LMA2 that it needs to
   start updating the localized routing states by sending RO Trigger
   (3.).  The remaining of the signaling is similar to Figure 3 with the
   exception that LMA2 must inform LMA1 of the final result of the
   procedure with RO Trigger Ack (6.).  Similarly to the previous case,
   the localized routing states at pMAG1 can be left to expire or
   deleted explicitly.

    Figure 5: Route Optimization Maintenance during Handover - Multiple
                                   LMAs

   Note: In the case that the MN attached to MAG2 performs the handover
   there would be a direct RO Init message from LMA2 towards the new MAG
   (no RO trigger message is sent) due to the fact that the RO Control
   is assigned to LMA2.

4.5.  Extension of the Localized Routing Lifetime

   Upon an expiring lifetime of localized routing states, it can be
   refreshed by any of the involved MAGs towards the respective LMA.
   This is accomplished by sending a RO Refresh message (1.) to the LMA,
   as depicted in Figure 6.  The LMA replies with the status with a RO
   Refresh Ack message (2.).  Expired localized routing states, which
   are not refreshed, are deleted and the traffic goes back to being
   forwarded through the LMA.

   In case of a multi-LMA scenario, MAGs can refresh the localized
   routing state lifetime by sending a RO Refresh message towards the
   respective LMA.  The receiving LMA must reply back with the status in
   a RO Refresh Ack message.  As in the single-LMA scenario above,
   expired localized routing states are deleted.

5.2.  Message Options

   This version of the protocol defines 1 new Mobility Header option,
   which is applied with the signaling messages specified in this
   document.  All options must meet the 32-bit boundary alignment.  A

   MAG-ADDR -   IPv6 address of the source/destination MN's MAG.
      Including the format is t.b.d.

   To signal the IPv6 address/prefix of the source and destination MN as
   communication endpoints, this specification uses the Home Network
   Prefix option of [RFC5213].

   To signal the IPv4 HoA of the source and destination MN as
   communication endpoints, this specification uses the IPv4 Home
   Address option of [RFC5555].

6.  IPv4 Considerations

6.1.  Localized routing for IPv4 Home Addresses

   IPv4 or dual stack enabled hosts may be served by a PMIPv6 network
   according to [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].  To support the
   set up and maintenance of localized routes for IPv4 Home Addresses in
   PMIPv6, MAGs must add both MNs' IPv4 Home Addresses into their
   conceptual data structures where they store information about the
   MNs' routing states.  Furthermore, MAGs must support encapsulation of
   IPv4 packets and dynamically enter and update the associated
   forwarding entry towards the correspondent MAG in their routing
   table.  For uplink traffic, MAGs must take routing decisions on the
   IP address tuple represented by the source and the destination
   address of the packet.

   To signal the IPv4 Home Address of the two MNs, whose routing path
   needs to be optimized, the localized routing protocol messages
   include a IPv4 HoA option in their signaling messages.  In case of
   localized routing for IPv4 HoAs, the IPv4 HoA option of the source
   and destination MN must be included in all signaling messages for the
   setup and maintenance of the localized routing states to identify the
   communication endpoints.  According to the definition in this
   document, the MN which originates the communication and whose IP
   packet triggers the set up of an optimized routing path, is
   considered as the Source, whereas the recipient of this packet is
   considered as the Destination.

6.2.  IPv4 transport network

   In case the transport network between PMIPv6 components supports IPv4
   only, encapsulation of signaling messages for localized routing is
   performed according to [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].  The
   same encapsulation modes apply to the protocol interface between
   MAGs.  In such case, a MAG must enable the same or a different IPv4
   address as used for the signaling with the LMA for the signaling with
   the correspondent MAG.  The same applies to LMAs, which must enable
   an IPv4 address for the signaling with a potentially correspondent
   LMA.  Selection of an appropriate encapsulation mode is out of scope
   of this version of the specification.  In case of an IPv4 transport
   network which has a NAT between a MAG and an LMA or even between
   MAGs, using IPv4-UDP encapsulation is recommended.

   NATs between MAGs may be detected according to the NAT presence
   detection scheme as described in
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support], whereas instead of a PBU/PBA
   handshake the RO Setup/RO Setup Ack signaling handshake is being used
   to apply the detection mechanism.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines 8 new Mobility Header types for the MH field in
   the Mobility Header.  These types are described in Section 5.1.
   According to the protocol specification, the Mobility Header type
   identifies also the protocol interface, on which a protocol message
   is being applied.

   This document defines 1 new Mobility Header option.  This option is
   described in Section 5.2.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security threats for route optimization in network-based mobility
   management comprise the danger of unauthorized set up or redirect of
   an established forwarding path by a malicious node.  Signaling
   messages of this protocol between a MAG and an LMA as well as between
   LMAs must be authenticated by means of IPsec [RFC4301].  The use of
   IPsec between an LMA and a MAG follows [RFC5213].

   Protection of signaling messages between an LMA and a MAG uses the
   mechanisms of Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4301] in
   transport mode with mandatory data origin authentication by means of
   a non-null payload authentication algorithm.  The use of encryption
   is optional.  The same requirements apply to signaling between LMAs
   as well as between MAGs.  In particular, if the network which
   interconnects two LMAs and/or two MAGs is not trusted, the use of
   encryption is recommended to support confidentiality protection
   between LMAs and between MAGs respectively.
