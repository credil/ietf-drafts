</section><section title="Introduction">
<t>Requesting help in an emergency using a communications device such as a telephone or mobile 
is an accepted practice in most of the world. As communications devices increasingly utilize 
the Internet to interconnect and communicate, users will continue to expect to use such devices 
to request help, regardless of whether or not they communicate using IP. This document describes 
establishment of a communications session by a user to a "Public Safety Answering Point" (PSAP) 
that is a call center established by response agencies to accept emergency calls. 
Such citizen/visitor-to-authority calls can be distinguished from those that are created by 
responders (authority-to-authority) using public communications infrastructure often involving 
some kind of priority access as defined in Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS) in IP 
Telephony <xref target="RFC4190"></xref>. They also can be distinguished from emergency warning 
systems that are authority-to-citizen.</t>
<t>Supporting emergency calling requires cooperation by a number of elements, their vendors and 
service providers. It discusses how end device and applications create emergency calls, how access 
networks supply location for some of these devices, how service providers assist the establishment 
and routing, and how PSAPs receive calls from the Internet.</t>
<t>The emergency response community will have to upgrade their facilities to support the wider 
range of communications services, but cannot be expected to handle wide variation in device and 
service capability. New devices and services are being made available that could be used to 
make a request for help that are not traditional telephones, and users are increasingly expecting 
them to be used to place emergency calls. However, many of the technical advantages of Internet 
multimedia require re-thinking of the traditional emergency calling architecture. This challenge 
also offers an opportunity to improve the operation of emergency calling technology, while potentially 
lowering its cost and complexity.</t> 
<t>It is beyond the scope of this document to enumerate and discuss all the differences between 
traditional (Public Switched Telephone Network) and IP based telephony, but calling on the Internet 
is characterized by:
<list style="symbols">
<t>the interleaving over the same infrastructure of a wider variety of services; </t> 
<t>the separation of the access provider from the application provider; </t> 
<t>the plethora of different media that can be accommodated; </t> 
<t>potential mobility of all end systems, including endpoints nominally thought of as fixed systems 
and not just those using radio access technology. For example, a wired phone connected to a router 
using a mobile data network such as EV-DO as an uplink.</t> 
</list></t>
<t>This document focuses on how devices using the Internet can place emergency calls and how PSAPs 
can handle Internet multimedia emergency calls natively, rather than describing how circuit-switched 
PSAPs can handle VoIP calls. In many cases, PSAPs making the transition from circuit-switched 
interfaces to packet-switched interfaces may be able to use some of the mechanisms described here, 
in combination with gateways that translate packet-switched calls into legacy interfaces, e.g., 
to continue to be able to use existing call taker equipment. There are many legacy telephone 
networks that will persist long after most systems have been upgraded to IP origination and 
termination of emergency calls. There will be PSAPs that require new systems to terminate to 
existing mechanisms for some time. Many of these legacy systems use telephone number based routing. 
Gateways and conversions between existing systems and newer systems defined by this document will be 
required. Since existing systems are governed primarily by local government regulations and national 
standards, the gateway and conversion details will be governed by national standards and thus are 
out of scope for this document.</t>
<t>Existing emergency call systems are organized locally or nationally; there are currently no international 
standards. However, the Internet crosses national boundaries, and thus international standards for 
equipment and software are required. To further complicate matters, VoIP endpoints can be connected 
through tunneling mechanisms such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Tunnels can obscure the identity 
of the actual access network that knows the location. This significantly complicates emergency calling, 
because the location of the caller and the first element that routes emergency calls can be on different 
continents, with different conventions and processes for handling of emergency calls.</t> 
<t>The IETF has historically refused to create national variants of its standards. Thus, this document 
attempts to take into account best practices that have evolved for circuit switched PSAPs, but makes no 
assumptions on particular operating practices currently in use, numbering schemes or organizational 
structures.</t> 
<t>This document discusses the use of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> 
by PSAPs and calling parties. While other inter-domain call signaling protocols may be used for emergency 
calling, SIP is ubiquitous and possesses the proper support of this use case. Only protocols such as 
H.323, XMPP/Jingle, ISUP and SIP are suitable for inter-domain communications, ruling out MGC protocols 
such as MGCP or H.248/Megaco. The latter protocols can naturally be used by the enterprise or carrier 
placing the call, but any such call would reach the PSAP through a media gateway controller, similar to 
how inter-domain VoIP calls would be placed. Other signaling protocols may also use protocol translation 
to communicate with a SIP-enabled PSAP.</t> 
<t>Existing emergency services rely exclusively on voice and conventional text telephony ("TTY") media 
streams. However, more choices of media offer additional ways to communicate and evaluate the situation 
as well as to assist callers and call takers in handling emergency calls. For example, instant messaging 
and video could improve the ability to communicate and evaluate the situation and to provide appropriate 
instruction prior to arrival of emergency crews. Thus, the architecture described here supports the 
creation of sessions of any media type, negotiated between the caller and PSAP using existing SIP protocol 
mechanisms <xref target="RFC3264"></xref>.</t> 
<t>Supporting emergency calling does not require any specialized SIP header fields, request methods, 
status codes, message bodies, or event packages, but does require that existing mechanisms be used in 
certain specific ways, as described below. User agents unaware of the recommendations in this draft may 
be able to place emergency calls, but functionality may be impaired. For example, if the UA does not 
implement the location mechanisms described, an emergency call may not be routed to the correct PSAP, 
and if the caller is unable to supply his exact location, dispatch of emergency responders may be delayed. 
Suggested behavior for both endpoints and servers is provided.</t> 
<t>From the point of view of the PSAP three essential elements characterize an emergency call:
<list style="symbols">
<t>The call is routed to the most appropriate PSAP, selected principally by the location of the 
caller.</t>
<t>The PSAP must be able to automatically obtain the location of the caller sufficiently accurate to 
dispatch a responder to help the caller.</t>
<t>The PSAP must be able to re-establish a session to the caller if for any reason the original session 
is lost.</t> 
</list></t>
</section><section title="Overview of how emergency calls are placed">
<t>An emergency call can be distinguished (<xref target="Identifying"></xref>) from any other call 
by a unique Service URN <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn"></xref>, that is placed in the call 
set-up signaling when a home or visited emergency dial string is detected. Because emergency services 
are local to specific geographic regions, a caller must obtain his location (Section 
<xref target="Location"></xref>) prior to making emergency calls. To get this location, either a form of 
measuring (e.g., GPS) (<xref target="EndSystemMeasuredLocation"></xref>) device location in the 
endpoint is deployed, or the endpoint is configured (<xref target="LocationConfiguration"></xref>) 
with its location from the access network's Location Information Server (LIS). The location is conveyed 
(<xref target="Conveyance"></xref>) in the SIP signaling with the call. The call is routed 
(<xref target="Routing"></xref>) based on location using the LoST protocol 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost"></xref>, that maps a location to a set of PSAP or URIs. Each URI 
resolves to a PSAP or an Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP) that serves a group of PSAPs. 
The call arrives at the PSAP with the location included in the INVITE request.</t> 
<t>The following is a quick overview for a typical Ethernet connected telephone using SIP signaling.
It illustrates one set of choices for various options presented later in this document.
<list style="symbols">
<t>The phone "boots" and connects to its access network</t> 

<t>The phone gets location from the DHCP server <xref target="RFC4676"></xref> or 
<xref target="RFC3825"></xref>, a HELD server <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"></xref> 
or the first level switch's LLDP server <xref target="LLDP"></xref>.</t> 

<t>The phone obtains the local emergency dial string(s) from the <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost"></xref> 
server for its current location. It also receives and caches the PSAP URI obtained from LoST.</t>

<t>It recognizes an emergency call from the dial strings and uses "urn:service:sos" 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn"></xref> to mark an emergency call.</t> 

<t>It determines the PSAP's URI by querying the LoST mapping server with its location.</t> 

<t>It puts its location in the SIP INVITE in a Geolocation header 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance"></xref> and forwards the call using its normal 
outbound call processing, that commonly involves an outgoing proxy.</t> 

<t>The proxy recognizes the call as an emergency call and routes the call using normal SIP routing 
mechanisms to the URI specified.</t> 

<t>The call routing commonly traverses an incoming proxy server in the emergency services network. 
That proxy would route to the PSAP.</t>

<t>The call is established with the PSAP and common media streams are created.</t> 

<t>The location of the caller is displayed to the call taker.</t>

<t>Figure 1 shows emergency call component topology and Figure 2 shows call establishment. 
These include the following:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Alice - who makes the emergency call.</t> 
<t>Configuration Servers - Servers providing Alice's UA its IP address and other configuration 
information, perhaps including location by-value or by-reference. In this flow, DHCP is used as 
an example location configuration protocol (LCP). Configuration servers also may include a SIP 
registrar for Alice's UA. Most SIP UAs will register, so it will be a common scenario for UAs 
that make emergency calls to be registered with such a server in the originating calling network. 
Registration would be required for the PSAP to be able to call back after an emergency call is 
completed. All the configuration messages are labeled M1 through M3, but could easily require 
more than 3 messages to complete.</t> 
<t>ESRP - The emergency services routing proxy server that is the incoming call proxy in the emergency 
services domain. The ESRP makes further routing decisions (e.g. based on PSAP state and the location 
of the caller) to choose the actual PSAP that handles the call. In some jurisdictions, this may 
involve another LoST query.</t> 
<t>LoST server - Processes the LoST request for Location + Service URN to PSAP-URI Mapping function, 
either for an initial request from a UA, or an in-call routing by the Proxy server in the 
originating network, or possibly by an ESRP.</t> 
<t>PSAP - Call center where emergency calls are destined for.</t> 
</list></t>
<t>Generally, Alice's UA either has location configured manually, has an integral location measurement 
mechanism, or it runs a LCP [M1] to obtain location from the access (broadband) network. 
For most devices, a LCP will be used, for example a DHCPREQUEST message or another location acquisition 
mechanism. Alice's UA then will most likely register [M2] with a SIP domain. This allows her to be 
contacted by other SIP entities. Next, her UA will perform an initial LoST query [M3] to learn a 
URI for use if the LoST query fails during an emergency call, or to use to test the emergency call 
mechanism. The LoST response may contain the dial string for emergency calls appropriate for the 
location provided.</t> 
<t>At some time after her device has booted, Alice initiates an emergency call. She may do this 
by dialing an emergency dial string valid for her current ("local") location, or for her "home" 
location.</t> 
<t>The UA recognizes the dial string. The UA attempts to refresh its location [M4], and with that 
location, to refresh the LoST mapping [M5], in order to get the most accurate information to use 
for routing the call. If the location request or the LoST request fails, or takes too long, the 
UA uses values it has cached.</t> 
<t>The UA creates a SIP INVITE [M6] request that includes the location.
<xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance"></xref> defines a SIP Geolocation header that 
contains either a location-by-reference URI or a <xref target="RFC2396"></xref> "cid" URL 
indicating where in the message body the location-by-value is.</t> 
<t>The INVITE message is routed to the ESRP [M7], that is the first inbound proxy for the 
emergency services domain. This message is then routed by the ESRP towards the most appropriate 
PSAP for Alice's location [M8], as determined by PSAP state, location and other information.</t> 
<t>A proxy in the PSAP chooses an available call taker and extends the call to its UA.</t> 
<t>The 200 OK response to the INVITE request traverses the path in reverse, from call taker 
UA to PSAP proxy to ESRP to originating network proxy to Alice's UA. The ACK completes the call 
set-up and the emergency call is established, allowing the PSAP call-taker to talk to Alice 
about Alice's emergency.</t> 
</section><section anchor="WhichDevices" title="Which devices and services should support 
emergency calls">
<t>Support for voice calls and real-time text calls placed through PSTN facilities or systems 
connected to the PSTN is found in present PSAPs. Future PSAPs will however support Internet 
connectivity and a wider range of media types and provide higher functionality. In general, 
if a user could reasonably expect to be able to place a call for help with the device, then the 
device or service should support emergency calling. Certainly, any device or service that looks 
like and works like a telephone (wired or mobile) should support emergency calling, but 
increasingly, users have expectations that other devices and services should work.</t>
<t>Certainly, any device or service that looks like and works like a telephone (wired or mobile) 
should support emergency calling, but increasingly, users have expectations that other devices 
and services should work.</t> 
<t>Using current (evolving) standards, devices that create media sessions and exchange audio, 
video and/or text, and have the capability to establish sessions to a wide variety of addresses, 
and communicate over private IP networks or the Internet, should support emergency calls.</t> 
</section><section anchor="Identifying" title="Identifying an emergency call">
<t>Using the PSTN, emergency help can often be summoned by dialing a nationally designated, 
widely known number, regardless of where the telephone was purchased. The appropriate number 
is determined by the infrastructure the telephone is connected to. However, this number differs 
between localities, even though it is often the same for a country or region, as it is in many 
countries in the European Union. In some countries, there is a single digit sequence that is used 
for all types of emergencies. In others, there are several sequences that are specific to the 
type of responder needed, e.g., one for police, another for fire. For end systems, on the other 
hand, it is desirable to have a universal identifier, independent of location, to allow the 
automated inclusion of location information and to allow the device and other entities in the 
call path to perform appropriate processing within the signaling protocol in an emergency call 
set-up.</t> 
<t>Since there is no such universal identifier, as part of the overall emergency calling 
architecture, common emergency call URNs are defined in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn"></xref>. An example, for a single number environment 
is "urn:service:sos". Users are not expected to "dial" an emergency URN. Rather, appropriate 
emergency dial strings is translated to corresponding service URNs, carried in the Request-URI 
of the INVITE. Such translation is best done by the endpoint, because emergency calls convey 
location in the signaling, but non emergency calls do not normally do that. If the device 
recognizes the emergency call, it can include location. Dial string recognition could be 
performed in a signaling intermediary (proxy server) if for some reason, the endpoint does not 
recognize it. For devices that are mobile or nomadic, an issue arises of whether the home or 
visited dialing strings should be used. Many users would prefer that their home dialing 
sequences work no matter where they are. Local laws and regulations may require the visited 
dialing sequence(s) always work. Having the home dial string work is optional.</t> 
<t>The mechanism for obtaining the dialing sequences for a given location is provided by LoST 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost"></xref>. If the endpoint does not support the translation 
of dial strings to telephone numbers, the dialing sequence would be represented as a dial 
string <xref target="RFC4967"></xref> and the outgoing proxy would recognize the dial string 
and translate to the service URN. To determine the local dial string, the proxy needs the 
location of the endpoint. This may be difficult in situations where the user can roam or be 
nomadic. Endpoint recognition of emergency dial strings is therefore preferred.</t> 
<t>Note: It is undesirable to have a single "button" emergency call user interface element. 
These mechanisms tend to result in a very high rate of false or accidental emergency calls. 
In order to minimize this rate, devices SHOULD only initiate emergency calls based on entry of 
specific emergency call dial strings.</t> 
<t>While in some countries there is a single 3 digit dial string that is used for all emergency 
calls (i.e. 9-1-1 in North America), in some countries there are several 3 digit numbers used 
for different types of calls. For example, in Switzerland, 1-1-7 is used to call police, 1-1-8 
is used to call the fire brigade, and 1-4-4 is used for emergency medical assistance. In other 
countries, there are no "short codes" or "service codes" for 3 digit dialing of emergency 
services and local (PSTN) numbers are used.</t> 
<t> <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn"></xref> introduces a universal emergency service 
URN scheme. On the wire, emergency calls include this type of URI in the Request-URI 
<xref target="RFC3261"></xref>. The scheme includes a single emergency URN (urn:service:sos) 
for use in countries with a single emergency dial string, and responder-specific ones 
(urn:service:sos.police) for countries where the user dials each service with separate numbers. 
Using the service:sos URN scheme, emergency calls can be recognized as such throughout the 
Internet.</t> 
</section><section anchor="Location" title="Location and its role in an emergency call">
<t>Location is central to the operation of emergency services. It is frequently the case that 
the user in an emergency is unable to provide a unique, valid location themselves. For this 
reason, location provided by the endpoint or the access network is needed. For practical 
reasons, each PSAP generally handles only calls for a certain geographic area, with overload 
arrangements between PSAPs to handle each others calls. Other calls that reach it by accident must 
be manually re-routed (transferred) to the most appropriate PSAP, increasing call handling delay 
and the chance for errors. The area covered by each PSAP differs by jurisdiction, where some 
countries have only a small number of PSAPs, while others decentralize PSAP responsibilities to 
the level of counties or municipalities.</t> 
<t>In most cases, PSAPs cover at least a city or town, but there are some areas where PSAP 
coverage areas follow old telephone rate center boundaries and may straddle more than one city. 
Irregular boundaries are common, often for historical reasons. Routing must be done based on 
PSAP service boundaries, the closest PSAP, or the PSAP that serves the nominal city name provided 
in the location may not be the correct PSAP.</t> 
<t>Accuracy of routing location is a complex subject. Calls must be routed quickly, but accurately, 
and location determination is often a time/accuracy tradeoff, especially with mobile devices or 
self measuring mechanisms. It is considered acceptable to base a routing decision on an accuracy 
equal to the area of one sector of a mobile cell site if no more accurate routing location is 
available.</t> 
<t>Routing to the most appropriate PSAP is always calculated on the location of the caller, 
despite the fact that some emergency calls are placed on behalf of someone else, and the location 
of the incident is sometimes not the location of the caller. In some cases, there are other 
factors that enter into the choice of the PSAP that gets the call, which may include factors other 
than location (such as caller media and language preference, PSAP state, etc.). However, location 
of the caller is the primary input to the routing decision.</t>
<t>Routing is but one of two uses for location in an emergency call. The other is for dispatch of 
a responder. Many mechanisms used to locate a caller have a relatively long "cold start" time. 
To get a location accurate enough for dispatch may take as much as 30 seconds. This is too long to 
wait for emergencies. Accordingly, it is common, especially in mobile systems to use a coarse 
location, for example, the cell site and sector serving the call, for routing purposes, and then 
to update the location when a more precise value is known prior to dispatch. In this document we 
use "routing location" and "dispatch location" when the distinction matters.</t>
<t>Accuracy of dispatch location is sometimes determined by local regulation, and is constrained 
by available technology. The actual requirement exceeds available technology. It is required that 
a device making an emergency call close to the "demising" or separation wall between two 
apartments in a high rise apartment building report location with sufficient accuracy to 
determine on what side of the wall it is on. This implies perhaps a 3 cm accuracy requirement. 
As of the date of this memo, typical assisted GPS uncertainty with 95% confidence is 100 m.</t>
<t>Location usually involves several steps to process and multiple elements are involved. In 
Internet emergency calling, where the endpoint is located is "Determined" using a variety of 
measurement or wire-tracing methods. Endpoints may be "Configured" with their own location by 
the access network. In some circumstances, a proxy server may insert location into the signaling 
on behalf of the endpoint. The location is "Mapped" to the URI to send the call to, and the 
location is "Conveyed" to the PSAP (and other elements) in the signaling. Likewise, we employ 
Location Configuration Protocols, Location Mapping Protocols, and Location Conveyance Protocols 
for these functions. The Location-to-Service Translation protocol 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost"></xref> is the Location Mapping Protocol defined by the 
IETF.</t>
<section anchor="LocationTypes" title="Types of location information">
<t>There are several ways location can be specified: 
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Civic">
Civic location information describes the location of a person or object by a street address 
that corresponds to a building or other structure. Civic location may include more finely grained 
location information such as floor, room and cubicle. Civic information comes in two forms: 
<list style="hanging">
 <t hangText="Jurisdictional">
    This refers to a civic location using actual political subdivisions, especially for the 
    community name.</t> 
  <t hangText="Postal">
    This refers to a civic location for mail delivery. The name of the post office 
    sometimes does not correspond to the community name and a postal address may contain 
    post office boxes or street addresses that do not correspond to an actual building. 
    Postal addresses are generally unsuitable for emergency call dispatch because the 
    post office conventions (for community name, for example) do not match those known 
    by the responders. The fact that they are unique can sometimes be exploited to 
    provide a mapping between a postal address and a civic address suitable to dispatch 
    a responder to.  In IETF location protocols, there is a element (Postal Community Name) 
    that can be included in a location to provide the post office name as well as the 
    actual jurisdictional community name.  There is no other accommodation for postal 
    addresses in these protocols.</t>
</list></t>
<t hangText="Geospatial (geo):">
Geospatial addresses contain longitude, latitude and altitude information based on an understood 
datum and earth shape model. While there have been many datums developed over time, most modern 
systems are using or moving towards the WGS84<xref target="WGS84"></xref> datum.</t> 
<t hangText="Cell tower/sector:">
Cell tower/sector is often used for identifying the location of a mobile handset, especially for 
routing of emergency calls. Cell tower and sectors identify the cell tower and the antenna sector 
that a mobile device is currently using. Traditionally, the tower location is represented as a 
point chosen to be within a certain PSAP service boundary who agrees to take calls originating 
from that tower/sector, and routing decisions are made on that point. Cell/sector information 
could also be represented as an irregularly shaped polygon of geospatial coordinates reflecting 
the likely geospatial location of the mobile device. Whatever representation is used must route 
correctly in the LoST database, where "correct" is determined by local PSAP management.</t> 
</list></t>
<t>In IETF protocols, civic and geospatial forms are both supported. The civic forms include both 
postal and jurisdictional fields. A cell tower/sector can be represented as a point (geo or civic) 
or polygon. Other forms of location representation must be mapped into either a geo or civic for 
use in emergency calls.</t>
<t>For emergency call purposes, conversion of location information from civic to geo or vice versa 
prior to conveyance is not desirable. The location should be sent in the form it was determined. 
Conversion between geo and civic requires a database. PSAPs may need to convert from whatever form 
they receive to another for responder purposes. They have a suitable database. However, if a 
conversion is done before the PSAP, and the database used is not exactly the one the PSAP uses, 
the double conversion has a high probability of introducing an error.</t> 
</section><section anchor="LocationDetermination" title="Location Determination">
<t>Location information can be entered by the user or installer of a device ("manual configuration"), 
measured by the end system, can be delivered to the end system by some protocol or measured by a 
third party and inserted into the call signaling. Choice of location determination mechanisms and 
their properties are out of scope for this document.</t>
<t>In some cases, an entity may have multiple sources of location information, possibly partially 
contradictory. This is particularly likely if the location information is determined both by the 
end system and a third party. Although self measured location (e.g. GPS) is attractive, access 
network provided location could be much more accurate, and more reliable in some environments (indoor 
high rise in dense urban areas for example).</t>
<section anchor="UserLocation" title="User-entered location information">
<t>Location information can be maintained by the end user or the installer of an endpoint in the 
endpoint itself, or in a database.</t> 
<t>Location information provided by end users is almost always less reliable than measured or wire 
database information, as users may mistype location information or may enter civic address 
information that does not correspond to a recognized (i.e. valid, see Section 
<xref target="Validation"></xref>) address. Users can neglect to change the data when the location of 
a device changes during or after movement.</t> 
<t>All that said, there are always a small number of cases where the automated mechanisms used by the 
access network to determine location fail to accurately reflect the actual location of the endpoint. 
For example, the user may deploy his own WAN behind an access network, effectively removing an endpoint 
some distance from the access network's notion of its location. There must be some mechanism provided 
to provision a location for an endpoint by the user or by the access network on behalf of a user. 
The use of the mechanism introduces the possibility of users falsely declaring themselves to be 
somewhere they are not. As an aside, normally, if an emergency caller insists that he is at a location 
different from what any automatic location determination system reports he is, responders will always 
be sent to the user's self-declared location. However this is a matter of local policy and is outside 
the scope of this document.</t> 
</section><section anchor="WireDatabase" title='Access network "wire database" location information'>
<t>Location information can be maintained by the access network, relating some form of identifier for 
the end subscriber or device to a location database ("wire database"). In enterprise LANs, wiremap 
databases map Ethernet switch ports to building locations. In DSL installations, the local telephone 
carrier maintains a mapping of wire-pairs to subscriber addresses.</t> 
<t>Accuracy of location historically has been to a street address level. However, this is not sufficient 
for larger structures. The PIDF-LO <xref target="RFC4119"></xref> with a recent extension 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-revised-civic-lo"></xref> permits interior building/floor/room 
and even finer specification of location within a street address. When possible, interior 
location should be supported.</t> 
<t>The threshold for when interior location is needed is approximately 650 m2 (that is derived 
from fire brigade recommendations of spacing of alarm pull stations) should have, but interior 
space layout, construction materials and other factors should be considered. The ultimate goal 
is to be able to find the person in need quickly if responders arrive at the location given.</t> 
<t>Even for IEEE 802.11 wireless access points, wire databases may provide sufficient location 
resolution. The location of the access point as determined by the wiremap may be supplied as 
the location for each of the clients of the access point. However, this may not be true for 
larger-scale systems such as IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) and IEEE 802.22 that typically have larger 
cells than those of IEEE 802.11. The civic location of an IEEE 802.16 base station may be of 
little use to emergency personnel, since the endpoint could be several kilometers away from the 
base station.</t> 
<t>Wire databases to the home are likely to be the most promising solution for residential users 
where a service provider knows the customer's service address. The service provider can then 
perform address validation (see <xref target="Validation"></xref>), similar to the 
current system in some jurisdictions.</t> 
</section><section anchor="EndSystemMeasuredLocation" title="End-system measured location information">
<t>Global Positioning System (GPS) and similar satellite based (e.g. Galileo) receivers may be 
embedded directly in the end device. GPS produces relatively high precision location fixes in 
open-sky conditions, but the technology still faces several challenges in terms of performance 
(time-to-fix and time-to-first-fix), as well as obtaining successful location fixes within 
shielded structures, or underground. It also requires all devices to be equipped with the 
appropriate GPS capability. GPS-derived locations are currently accurate to tens of meters. 
Many mobile devices require using some kind of "assist", that may be operated by the access 
network (A-GPS) or by a government (WAAS).</t> 
<t>GPS systems may be always on; where location will always be available accurately 
(assuming the device can "see" enough satellites). Mobile devices may not be able to sustain the 
power levels required to keep the measuring system active. This means that when location is 
needed, the device has to start up the measurement mechanism. This typically takes tens of seconds, 
far too long to wait to be able to route an emergency call. For this reason, devices that don't 
have end-system measured location mechanisms always on need another way to get a routing location. 
Typically this would be a location associated with a radio link (cell site/sector).</t>
</section><section anchor="NetworkMeasuredLocation" title="Network measured location information">
<t>The access network may locate end devices. Techniques include:
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Wireless triangulation:">
Elements in the network infrastructure triangulate end systems based on signal strength, 
angle of arrival or time of arrival. Common mechanisms deployed include:
<list style="numbers">
<t>Time Difference Of Arrival - TDOA</t> 
<t>Uplink Time Difference Of Arrival - U-TDOA</t> 
<t>Angle of Arrival - AOA</t> 
<t>RF-Fingerprinting</t> 
<t>Advanced Forward Link Trilateration - AFLT</t> 
<t>Enhanced Forward Link Trilateration - EFLT</t>
</list>
Sometimes multiple mechanisms are combined, for example A-GPS with AFLT</t> 
<t hangText="Location beacons:">
A short range wireless beacon, e.g., using Bluetooth or infrared, announces its location 
to mobile devices in the vicinity. This allows devices to get location from the beacon source's location.</t>
</list></t>
</section></section><section anchor="WhoAddsLocation" title="Who adds location, endpoint or proxy">
<t>The IETF emergency call architecture prefers endpoints to learn their location and supply it 
on the call. Outbound proxies that support devices that do not support location may have to 
add location to emergency calls at a proxy server. Some calling networks have relationships 
with all access networks the device may be connected to, and that may allow the proxy to 
accurately determine location of the endpoint. However NATs and other middleboxes often make it 
impossible to determine a reference identifier the access network could use to determine the 
location. Systems designers are discouraged from relying on proxies to add location. The technique 
may be useful in some limited circumstances as devices are upgraded to meet the requirements of 
this document, or where relationships between access networks and calling networks are feasible 
and can be relied upon to get accurate location.</t> 
<t>Proxy insertion of location complicates dial string recognition. As noted in Section 
<xref target="Location"></xref>, local dial strings depend on the location of the caller. 
If the device does not know its own location, it cannot use the LoST service to learn the 
local emergency dial strings. The calling network must provide another way for the device 
to learn the local dial string (and update it when the user moves to a location where the 
dial string(s) change) or do the dial string determination itself.</t>
</section><section anchor="LocationReference" title="Location and references to location">
<t>Location information may be expressed as the actual civic or geospatial value but can be 
transmitted as by value (wholly contained within the signaling message) or by reference 
(a URI pointing to the value residing on a remote node waiting to be dereferenced). Each form 
is better suited to some applications than others.</t>
<t>When location is transmitted by value, the location information is available to each device; 
on the other hand, location objects can be large, and only represent a single snapshot of the 
device's location. Location references are small and can be used to represent a time-varying 
location, but the added complexity of the dereference step introduces a risk that location 
will not be available to parties that need it.</t>
</section><section anchor="LocationConfiguration" title="End system location configuration">
<t>Unless a user agent has access to provisioned or locally measured location information, 
it must obtain it from the access network. There are several location configuration protocols 
(LCPs) that can be used for this purpose such as: 
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="DHCP">
DHCP can deliver civic <xref target="RFC4676"></xref> or geospatial  
<xref target="RFC3825"></xref> information. User agents need to support both formats. Note 
that a user agent can use DHCP, via the DHCP REQUEST or INFORM messages, even if it uses 
other means to acquire its IP address.</t> 
<t hangText="HELD"> 
HELD <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"></xref> can deliver a civic or 
geo, by value or by reference, as a layer 7 protocol. The query typically uses the IP address 
of the requestor as an identifier and returns the location value or reference associated 
with that identifier. HELD is typically transported on HTTP.</t> 
<t hangText="Link-Layer Discovery Protocol">
Layer Discovery Protocol <xref target="LLDP"></xref> with Media Endpoint Device extensions 
<xref target="LLDP-MED"></xref> can be used to deliver location information directly from 
the Layer 2 network infrastructure, and also supports both civic and geospatial formats 
identical in format to DHCP methods.</t>
</list></t>
<t>Each LCP has limitations in the kinds of networks that can reasonably support it. For 
this reason, it is not possible to choose a single mandatory-to-deploy LCP. For endpoints 
with common network connections (such as an Ethernet jack or a WiFi connection) serious 
incompatibilities would ensue unless every network supported every protocol, or 
alternatively, every device supported every protocol. For this reason, a list of LCPs is 
established in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"></xref>. Every endpoint that could 
be used to place emergency calls must implement all of the protocols on the list. Every 
access network must deploy at least one of them. It is recognized that this is an onerous 
requirement, that it would be desirable to eliminate. However, since it is the 
variability of the networks that prevent a single protocol from being acceptable, it 
must be the endpoints that implement all of them, and to accommodate a wide range of 
devices, networks must deploy at least one of them.</t> 
<t>Often, network operators and device designers believe that they have a simpler 
environment and some other network specific mechanism can be used to provide location. 
Unfortunately, it is very rare to actually be able to limit the range of devices that 
may be connected to a network.</t>
<t>For example, existing mobile networks are being used to support routers and LANs 
behind a wireless data network WAN connection, with Ethernet connected phones 
connected to that. It is possible that the access network could support a protocol not 
on the list, and require every handset in that network to use that protocol for emergency 
calls. However, the Ethernet connected phone won't be able to acquire location, and the 
user of the phone is unlikely to be dissuaded from placing an emergency call on that phone. 
The widespread availability of gateways, routers and other network-broadening devices 
means that indirectly connected endpoints are possible on nearly every network. 
Network operators and vendors are cautioned that shortcuts to meeting this requirement 
are seldom successful.</t> 
<t>Location for non-mobile devices is normally expected to be acquired at network 
attachment time and retained by the device. It should be refreshed when the cached value 
becomes invalid. For example, if DHCP is the acquisition protocol, refresh of location 
may occur when the IP address lease is renewed. At the time of an emergency call, 
the location should be refreshed, with the retained location used if the location 
acquisition does not immediately return a value. Mobile devices may determine location 
at network attachment time and periodically thereafter as a backup in case location 
determination at the time of call does not work. Mobile device location may be 
refreshed when a TTL expires, the device moves beyond some boundaries (as provided by 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost"></xref>). Normally, mobile devices will acquire its 
location at call time for use in an emergency call routing. See Section 
<xref target="LocationUpdate"></xref> for a further discussion on location updates 
for dispatch location.</t>
</section><section anchor="WhenConfigure" title="When location should be configured">
<t>Devices should get routing location immediately after obtaining local network 
configuration information. The presence of NAT and VPN tunnels (that assign new IP 
addresses to communications) can obscure identifiers used by LCPs to determine 
location, especially using HELD. In some cases, such as residential NAT devices, 
the NAT is before the access network demarcation point and thus the IP address 
seen by the access network is the right identifier for location of the residence. 
In many enterprise environments, VPN tunnels can obscure the actual IP address. 
Some VPN mechanisms can be bypassed (a query to the LCP can be designated to go 
through the direct IP path, using the correct IP address, and not through the 
tunnel). In other cases, no bypass is possible. Of course, LCPs that use Layer 2 
mechanisms (DHCP Location options and LLDP-MED) are usually immune from such problems 
because they do not use the IP address as the identifier for the device seeking 
location.</t> 
<t>It is desirable that routing location information be periodically refreshed. 
A LIS supporting a million subscribers each refreshing once per day would need 
to support a query rate of 1,000,00 / (24 * 60 * 60) = 12 queries per second.</t> 
<t>It is desirable for routing location information to be requested immediately 
before placing an emergency call. However, if there is any significant delay in 
getting more recent location, the call should be placed with the most recent 
location information the device has. In mobile handsets, routing is often 
accomplished with the cell site and sector of the tower serving the call, 
because it can take many seconds to start up the location determination mechanism 
and obtain an accurate location.</t>
<t>There is a tradeoff between the time it takes to get a routing location and 
the accuracy (technically, confidence and uncertainty) obtained. Routing an 
emergency call quickly is required. However, if location can be substantially 
improved by waiting a short time (e.g. for some sort of "quick fix"), it's 
preferable to wait. 3 seconds, that is the current nominal time for a quick 
fix, is a very long time to wait for help, and systems designers should attempt 
to provide accurate routing location in much less time.</t>
<t>NENA recommends IP based systems complete calls in two seconds (last dial 
press to ring at PSAP).</t> 
</section><section anchor="Conveyance" title="Conveying location in SIP">
<t>When an emergency call is placed, the endpoint should put location in the 
signaling with the call. That is referred to as "conveyance" to distinguish 
it from "configuration". In SIP, the location information is conveyed following 
the procedures in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance"></xref>. 
The form of the location information obtained by the acquisition protocol may not 
be the same as the conveyance protocol uses (PIDF-LO <xref target="RFC4119"></xref>). 
Mapping by the endpoint to PIDF may be required.</t> 
</section><section anchor="LocationUpdate" title="Location updates">
<t>As discussed above, it make take some time for some measurement mechanisms 
to get a location accurate enough for dispatch, and a routing location with less 
accuracy may be provided to get the call established early. The PSAP needs the 
dispatch location before it sends the call to the responder. This requires an 
update of the location.</t> 
<t>In addition, the location of a mobile caller, e.g., in a vehicle or aircraft, 
can change significantly during the emergency call. While most often this change 
is not significant, the PSAP must be able to get updated location information 
while it is processing the call.</t> 
<t>Subscription is preferred so that the LIS notifies the PSAP when accurate 
location is updated rather than requiring a poll operation from the PSAP to 
the LIS.</t>
<t>A PSAP has no way to request an update of a location-by-value. If the UAC 
gets new location, it must reINVITE or UPDATE to supply the new location.</t> 
<t>Generally, the PSAP can wait for an accurate location for dispatch. However, 
there is no fixed limit known in advance; it depends on the 
nature of the emergency. At some point the PSAP must dispatch. In a 
subscription environment, the PSAP could update the parameters in the filter 
(immediate response required). In a HELD dereference, there is no way to 
cancel and the PSAP will have to choose a ResponseTime that it will wait for 
even if it wants to dispatch sooner than that. (Change as the discussion 
on ResponseTime evolves).</t>
</section><section anchor="MultipleLocations" title="Multiple locations">
<t>Handling multiple locations is discussed in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile"></xref>. Conflicting location 
information is particularly harmful if different routes (PSAPs) result from 
LoST queries for the multiple locations. Guidelines for dealing with multiple 
locations are also given in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost"></xref>. 
Generally, if a UA gets multiple locations, it must choose the one to use. 
If a proxy is inserting location and has multiple locations, it must choose 
the one to use.</t> 
<t>The ability of the UA or proxy to understand how and from whom it learned 
its location, and include this information element in the location object 
that is sent to the PSAP, provides the call-taker with many pieces of 
information to make decisions upon, and guidance for what to ask the caller 
and what to tell the responders.</t> 
<t>The call should indicate the location information that has been used for routing, 
so that the same location information is used for all call routing decisions. 
The location conveyance mechanism 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance"></xref> contains a parameter 
for this purpose.</t>
</section><section anchor="Validation" title="Location validation">
<t>It is recommended that location must be validated prior to a device placing 
an actual emergency call; some jurisdictions require that this be done. 
Validation in this context means both that there is a mapping from the address 
to a PSAP and that the PSAP understands how to direct responders to the location. 
Determining the addresses that are valid can be difficult. There are, for example, 
many cases of two names for the same street, or two streets with the same name 
in a city. In some countries, the current system provides validation. 
For example, in the United States, the Master Street Address Guide (MSAG) records 
all valid street addresses and is used to ensure that the service addresses in 
phone billing records correspond to valid emergency service street addresses. 
Validation is normally a concern for civic addresses, although there could be 
a concern that a given geo is within at least one PSAP service boundary; that is, 
a "valid" geo is one where there is a mapping.</t> 
<t>LoST <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost"></xref> includes a location validation 
function. Validation should ideally be performed when a location is entered 
into a Location Information Server. It should be confirmed periodically, 
because the mapping database undergoes slow change; new streets are added or 
removed, community names change, postal codes change, etc. Endpoints may wish 
to validate locations they receive from the access network, and will need to 
validate manually entered locations. Proxies that insert location may wish to 
validate locations they receive from a LIS. Test functions 
(<xref target="Testing"></xref>) should also re-validate.</t> 
</section><section anchor="DefaultLocation" title="Default location">
<t>Occasionally, the access network cannot determine the actual location of 
the caller. In these cases, it must supply a default location. The default location 
should be as accurate as the network can determine. For example, in a cable network, 
a default location for each Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS), with a 
representative location for all cable modems served by that CMTS could be provided 
if the network is unable to resolve the subscriber to any unit less than the CMTS. 
Default locations must be marked as such so that the PSAP knows that the 
location is not accurate.</t> 
</section><section anchor="OtherLocation" title="Other location considerations">
<t>The endpoint is responsible for mapping any form of location it receives from 
an LCP into PIDF-LO form if the LCP did not directly return a PIDF.</t>
<t>To prevent against spoofing of the DHCP server, devices implementing DHCP for 
location configuration should use DHCP security mechanisms 
<xref target="RFC3118"></xref>.</t>
<t>Location may be used for routing by multiple proxy servers on the path. 
Mechanism such as S/MIME in SIP signaling <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> cannot 
be used because they obscure location. Only hop-by-hop mechanisms such as TLS 
should be used. Location information is sensitive and must be protected 
<xref target="RFC3693"></xref>. Although support of TLS is mandatory in 
<xref target="RFC3261"></xref>, many devices do not support it. Implementing 
location conveyance in SIP mandates inclusion of TLS support.</t>
</section></section><section anchor="UnitializedDevices" title="Uninitialized devices">
<t>Support of devices that are not registered, or that don't have valid call 
back identifiers is complex. In some jurisdictions, for some services, support 
of emergency calls from so-called "uninitialized" devices is required. 
For example, cellular providers in the United States must support calls to 9-1-1 
from a mobile phone that does not have an active service contract. It is 
attractive for such devices to be able to be used in an emergency. However, 
the requirement to do so has caused a huge number of prank calls to the 
emergency service. In some countries, it is common to attempt to place an emergency 
call from an unitialized device in the local bazaars to prove to a would-be 
purchaser that the phone works. For this reason, PSAP authorities discourage 
support for unititialized devices.</t> 
<t>An unitialized device that can place an emergency call must supply location 
the same as a fully enabled device, must carry a call back URI that can be used 
to call the device back, and should have identifiers in the signaling that can 
be used to identify the device.</t> 
</section><section anchor="Routing" title="Routing the call to the PSAP">
<t>Emergency calls are routed based on one or more of the following criteria 
expressed in the call setup request (INVITE): 
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Location:">
Since each PSAP serves a limited geographic region and transferring existing 
calls delays the emergency response, calls need to be routed to the most 
appropriate PSAP. In this architecture, emergency call setup requests contain 
location information, expressed in civic or geospatial coordinates, that allows 
such routing. If there is no or imprecise (e.g., cell tower and sector) 
information at call setup time, an on-going emergency call may also be transferred 
to another PSAP based on location information that becomes available in mid-call.</t> 
<t hangText="Type of emergency service:">
In some jurisdictions, emergency calls for fire, police, ambulance or mountain 
rescue are directed to just those emergency-specific PSAPs. This mechanism is 
supported by marking emergency calls with the proper service identifier 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn"></xref>.</t> 
<t hangText="Media capabilities of caller:">
In some cases, emergency call centers for specific caller media preferences, 
such as typed text or video, are separate from PSAPs serving voice calls. 
Routing based on media would be accomplished at an ESRP. Also, even if media 
capability does not affect the selection of the PSAP, there may be call takers 
within the PSAP that are specifically trained, e.g., in interactive text or 
sign language communications, where routing within the PSAP based on the media 
offer would be provided.</t> 
</list></t>
<t>Routing for calls by location and by service is the primary function LoST 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost"></xref> provides. LoST accepts a query with 
location (by-value) in either civic or geospatial form, plus a service identifier, 
and returns a URI (or set of URIs) to route the call to. Normal SIP 
<xref target="RFC3261"></xref> routing functions are used to resolve the URI 
to a next hop destination.</t> 
<t>The endpoint can complete the LoST mapping from its location at boot time, 
and periodically thereafter. It should attempt to obtain a "fresh" location, 
and from that a current mapping when it places an emergency call.  
If accessing either its location acquisition or mapping functions fail, 
it should use this cached value. The call would follow its normal outbound 
call processing.</t>
<t>Determining when the device leaves the area provided by the LoST service 
can tax small mobile devices. For this reason, the LoST server should return 
a simple (small number of points) polygon for geo reported location 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile"></xref>. This can be an enclosing 
subset of the area when the reported point is not near an edge or a smaller 
edge section when the reported location is near an edge. Civic location is 
uncommon for mobile devices, but reporting that the same mapping is good 
within a community name, or even a street, may be very helpful for WiFi 
connected devices that roam and obtain civic location from the AP they are 
connected to.</t> 
<t>Networks that support devices that do not implement LoST mapping themselves 
would have the outbound proxy do the mapping. The proxy must have the location 
of the endpoint, that is often difficult for the calling network to accurately 
determine. The endpoint may have its location, but would not normally include 
it on the call signaling. There is no mechanism provided in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance"></xref> to allow a proxy to 
require the endpoint supply location, because that would open the endpoint 
to an attack by any proxy on the path to get it to reveal location. 
The Proxy can redirect a call to the service URN that, if the device 
recognized the significance, would include location in the redirected call. 
All networks should detect emergency calls and supply default location 
and/or routing if it is not already performed.</t> 
<t>With the URI obtained from mapping, whether by the endpoint or the proxy, 
the proxy routes the call. Normal SIP <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> and 
<xref target="RFC3263"></xref> mechanisms are used to route calls to the URI 
obtained from the LoST query.</t> 
<t>Often, the SIP routing of an emergency call will first route to an incoming 
call proxy in the domain operated by the emergency service. That proxy is 
called an "Emergency Services Routing Proxy" (ESRP). The ESRP, which is a 
normal SIP proxy server, may use a variety of PSAP state information, the 
location of the caller, and other criteria to onward route the call to the PSAP. 
In order for the ESRP to route on media choice, the initial INVITE has to 
supply an SDP Offer.</t>
</section><section anchor="Signaling" title="Signaling of emergency calls">
<section anchor="TLS" title="Use of TLS">
<t>As discussed above, location is carried in all emergency calls in the call 
signaling. Since emergency calls carry privacy-sensitive information, they 
are subject to the requirements for geospatial protocols 
<xref target="RFC3693"></xref>. In particular, signaling information should 
be carried in TLS, i.e., in 'sips' mode. However, it is unacceptable to have 
an emergency call fail to complete because a TLS connection was not created, 
for any reason. Thus the call should be attempted with TLS, but if the TLS 
session establishment fails, the call should be automatically retried without TLS. 
In many cases, persistent TLS connections can be maintained between elements 
to minimize the time needed to establish them <xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-outbound"></xref>.
In other circumstances, use of session resumption <xref target="RFC4507"></xref> is
recommended.  IPSEC <xref target="RFC2401"></xref> is an acceptable alternative to TLS.</t>
</section><section anchor="UAsignaling" title="SIP signaling requirements for 
User Agents">
<t>SIP UAs that do local dial string interpretation, location, and emergency 
call route will create SIP INVITE messages with the Service URN in the 
Request URI, the LoST-determined URI for the PSAP in a Route header, and the 
location in a Geolocation header. The INVITE must also have appropriate 
call back identifiers To enable media sensitive routing, the call should 
include an SDP offer.</t>
</section><section anchor="ProxySignaling" title="SIP signaling requirements for proxy servers">
<t>SIP Proxy servers in the path of an emergency call must be able to assist 
UAs that are unable to provide any of the location based routing steps and 
recognition of dial strings. They are also expected to provide identity 
information for the caller.</t>
</section></section><section anchor="Callbacks" title="Call backs">
<t>The call-taker must be able to reach the emergency caller if the original 
call is disconnected. In traditional emergency calls, wireline and wireless 
emergency calls include a callback identifier for this purpose. In SIP systems, 
the caller must include a Contact header field indicating its device URI, 
if globally routable, or possibly a GRUU <xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-gruu"></xref> 
if calls need to be routed via a proxy. This identifier would be used to 
initiate call-backs immediately by the call-taker if, for example, the call is 
prematurely dropped. This is a change from <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> 
where Contact: is optional.</t>
<t>In addition, a call-back identifier must be included either as the URI in 
the From header field <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> verified by SIP Identity 
<xref target="RFC4474"></xref> , or as a network asserted URI 
<xref target="RFC3325"></xref>. This identifier would be used to initiate a 
call-back at a later time and may reach the caller, not necessarily on the 
same device (and at the same location) as the original emergency call as per 
normal SIP rules.</t> 
<t>Emergency authorities generally discourage support of unitialized devices 
(see <xref target="UnitializedDevices"></xref>. If an uninitialized 
device does place an emergency call, some kind of call back URI must be 
provided (e.g. a GRUU) in the Contact: header. It is useful to be able to 
call the device back some time later as well by including some form of URI 
in a network asserted identity.</t>
</section><section anchor="MidCall" title="Mid-call behavior">
<t>A PSAP may need to REFER <xref target="RFC3515"></xref> a call to a bridge 
for conferencing. The caller should also be prepared to have the call 
transferred (usually attended, but possibly blind) as per 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples"></xref>.</t> 
</section><section anchor="Termination" title="Call termination">
<t>It is undesirable for the caller to terminate an emergency call. 
PSAP call termination is accomplished with normal SIP call termination 
procedures.</t> 
</section><section anchor="DisableFeatures" title="Disabling of features">
<t>Certain features that can be invoked while a normal call is active are 
not permitted when the call is an emergency call. Services such as Call Waiting, 
Call Transfer, Three Way Call and Flash Hold should be disabled.</t>
<t>Certain features can interfere with calls from a PSAP and should be disabled. 
The domain of a PSAP can be determined from the domain answering an emergency call. 
A time limit after an emergency call should be established during which any call 
from the same domain and directed to the supplied Contact: or AoR should be 
accepted as a call-back from the PSAP.</t>
</section><section anchor="Media" title="Media">
<t>PSAPs should always accept RTP media streams <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>. 
Traditionally, voice has been the only media stream accepted by PSAPs. In some 
countries, text, in the form of BAUDOT codes or similar tone encoded signaling 
within a voiceband is accepted ("TTY") for persons who have hearing disabilities. 
With the Internet comes a wider array of potential media that a PSAP should accept. 
Using SIP signaling includes the capability to negotiate media. Normal SIP 
offer/answer <xref target="RFC3264"></xref> negotiations should be used to agree 
on the media streams to be used. PSAPs should accept real-time text 
<xref target="RFC4103"></xref>. All PSAPs should accept G.711 A law (and mu Law 
in North America) encoded voice as described in <xref target="RFC3551"></xref>. 
Newer text forms are rapidly appearing, with Instant Messaging now very common, 
PSAPs should accept IM with at least <xref target="RFC3428"></xref> as well as 
<xref target="RFC3920"></xref>. Video may be important to support Video Relay 
Service (Sign language interpretation) as well as modern video phones.</t>
<t>Media should be kept secure, preferably by use of Secure RTP 
<xref target="RFC3711"></xref>. </t>
</section><section anchor="Testing" title="Testing">
<t>Since the emergency calling architecture consists of a number of pieces operated 
by independent entities, it is important to be able to test whether an emergency 
call is likely to succeed without actually occupying the human resources at a PSAP. 
Both signaling and media paths need to be tested since NATs and firewalls may 
allow the session setup request to reach the PSAP, while preventing the exchange 
of media.</t> 
<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"></xref> includes a description of an 
automated test procedure that validates routing, signaling and media path continuity. 
This test would be used at boot time, and whenever the device location changes 
enough that a new PSAP mapping is returned from LoST. A manual operation for the 
test should also be possible.</t>
<t>The PSAP needs to be able to control frequency and duration of the test, and 
since the process could be overused, it may temporarily or permanently suspend its 
operation.</t> 
<t>There is a concern associated with testing during a so-called 
"avalanche-restart" event where, for example a large power outage affects a large 
number of endpoints, that, when power is restored, all attempt to reboot and, 
possibly, test. Devices need to randomize their initiation of a boot time test 
to avoid the problem.</t> 
</section><section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>Security considerations for emergency calling have been documented in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-security-threats"></xref>, 
and <xref target="I-D.barnes-geopriv-lo-sec"></xref>. </t>
