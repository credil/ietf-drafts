			<t>A service provider needs to identify the ingress Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (<xref target="RFC3261">RFC 3261</xref>) server of a peering network before it can signal and route SIP-based real-time communications sessions. This function of locating the ingress SIP server of a peering network is typically performed by the egress SIP server of the service provider originating the SIP session.  Also, the ingress server in the peering network needs to locate the originating service provider's egress server in situations where the peering connection is terminated after receiving a SIP request or if the egress SIP server of originating service provider fails.  The SIP servers at the originating and peering sides use DNS procedures, using both SRV <xref target="RFC3261"/> and <xref target="RFC3404">NAPTR</xref> records, in order to locate each other. It should be noted that </t>

				<t>
				SIP systems are represented by user agents (UA).  The diagram below shows the case of Direct Peering where a user agent (UA1), hosted by a service provider (SP1), initiates a SIP session to a User Agent (UA2), hosted by another service provider (SP2). The egress SIP server of SP1 is a SIP Signaling Path Border Element (SBE) as defined in Section 3 of <xref target="SPEERMINT-Terminology"/>, called SBE1, that interfaces with session peering service provider SP2. The SIP session initiated by UA1 is received by this network element, SBE1.  The resource to which the SIP request needs to be routed by SBE1 is identified by a SIP or SIPS URI.  For example, this could be the SIP URI of UA2 found in the Request-URI of the SIP request received by SBE1.  Alternatively, for example, this could also be the next hop from SBE1 found in the topmost Route header of SIP request.  In order to determine the resource to route the request to, SP1 MAY make use of ENUM <xref target="RFC3761"/> lookup services or some other internal lookup to determine the SIP URI of the resource.  Such an ENUM lookup service may use e164.arpa or one or more other private ENUM zones.  This lookup MAY be performed by SBE1 or another network element of SP1.

    			<t>In order to route the SIP request to this resource in SP2, SBE1 needs to determine the ingress SIP signaling path border element for SP2, called SBE2, by resolving the SIP or SIPS URI using DNS.  SBE1 makes use of the NAPTR and DNS SRV mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC3263"/> to determine the IP address, port, and transport protocol for peering with the SP2 ingress SIP proxy server (i.e. SBE2).  SBE1 and SBE2 which are involved in the session peering, support a set of protocols and have list of preferences for these protocols. UDP, TCP and TLS MUST be supported by these proxies [EDITORIAL NOTE: QUESTION FOR WORKING GROUP ON WHAT SHOULD BE A MUST HERE - JUST TLS OR ALL?]. </t>
   
   
   	<t>[EDITORIAL NOTE: ALEX SUGGESTS ADDING A REFERENCE TO TLS IN FIRST USE ABOVE]</t>
   	
			   <t>As a best current practice, SBE1 and SBE2 SHOULD be deployed in a highly scalable and highly available manner, such as a cluster of servers. These servers are of different prioritization and weight, to ensure capacity-based load balancing. [EDITORIAL NOTE: CONSIDER REWORDING THIS LAST SENTENCE]</t>
   
				<t>The figure below shows the case of Indirect Peering where SBE2 is the ingress SIP server of a transit service provider. The mechanism to locate SBE2 is the same as described for Direct Peering scenario. </t>

				   <t>Depending on what transport protocols SBE1 supports, SBE1 selects one from the preference list of NAPTR results and performs the SRV lookup to obtain a list of available server instances for SBE2. TLS SHOULD be the preferred transport protocol for peering between SBE1 and SBE2.  </t>
 
  <t> In our example, SBE1 uses TCP, the SRV lookup for _sip._tcp.example.com would return this list of available servers : </t>
<figure anchor='srv-lookup-data'>
<artwork><![CDATA[
;;    Priority Weight   Port   Target 
IN SRV  0        1      5060   server1.example.com 
IN SRV  0        2      5060   server2.example.com
]]></artwork>
</figure>
    
   <t>Alternatively, if no NAPTR records are found, then SBE1 uses the preferred transport protocol and issues an SRV query for that specific transport using "sips" for SIPS URI and SIP URI with TLS and "sip" for SIP URI as the SRV domain prefix. </t>
    
  <t> In our example, SBE1 prefers to use TCP and target SIP URI of SP2 is sip:alice@example2.com, it sends a SRV query for _sip._tcp.example2.com.  </t>
    
   <t>The SRV responses MAY also include A and/or AAAA records with it.</t>

					<section anchor='using_srv' title='Using SRV Results' toc='include'>
				   <t>If A records or AAAA records are not returned with the SRV responses, procedures from <xref target="RFC2782"/> describes how to use and interpret the results obtained from the SRV query.  The target entry of the SRV RRs is looked up by querying the DNS for address records. If the SRV response from DNS includes A or AAAA records with it, it will cut down on round trips and lookup of DNS again for target entry. On determining the transport protocol, service, port and address record from the SRV RRs as described above, the SBE1 will try to connect to the (protocol, address, service).  Once the connection is established to an available instance of SBE2, SBE1 sends the SIP request to SBE2.  SBE1 MUST act in a stateful manner and any retransmission of SIP requests for a specific SIP transaction, including ACKS for non-2xx response or CANCEL for that SIP transaction MUST go to the same server instance of SBE2. </t>
    
   <t>When SBE1 sends the SIP request to SBE2, it SHOULD set the sent-by parameter of the topmost Via header in the SIP request to a domain that identifies SBE1.  It MUST NOT specify the port. </t>

				<section anchor='ha' title='High Availability' toc='include'>
				<t>High Availability is ensured by detecting failures in the ability to connect to SBE1 and SBE2 server instances.  In the event of a failure, when SBE1 tries to send SIP INVITE to SBE2, the following failures could occur:  </t>					
					
					<section anchor='failure1' title='SBE1 Fails to Reach SBE2' toc='include'>
				   <t>A 503 error response is reported by the transaction layer, or failure can occur at the transport layer due to TCP disconnect in connection, ICMP error in UDP or time out at transport layer or SIP layer timeout when its not receiving any SIP response.  In such situations, SBE1 tries a new SIP request transaction to the next available server instance of SBE2 as determined by SRV RRs entry. The SIP T1 timer on SBE1 SHOULD be configurable with a upper limit value of 500ms. A shorter value of T1, say 100ms, reflects a faster fail-over support. </t>
				   
				   <t>[EDITORIAL NOTE: ALEX FINDS FIRST SENTENCE ABOVE CONFUSING - CONSIDER REWORDING IT]</t>
				   
				   <t>[EDITORIAL NOTE: ALEX SUGGESTS ADDING A REF TO PROPER SECTION OF SRV DOC, AS WELL AS REF FOR SIP TIMERS]</t>
				   
					</section>
					
					<section anchor='failure2' title='Using SRV Results' toc='include'>
				   <t>Failure may also occur after the request is received by SBE2 from SBE1 due to closure of the transport connection the request came in on at SBE2, before the response can be sent back to SBE1.  In this situation, SBE2 uses the domain value present in the 'sent-by' parameter in the top most Via header of the received SIP INVITE, and queries for SRV records at this domain name using the service identifier "_sips" if the Via transport is "TLS", "_sip" otherwise. The sorted list of SRV RRs are obtained and used as described in <xref target="RFC2782"/> to send the response back to SBE1.  If the topmost element in the list of server instances of SBE1 fails, the next available one is tried. </t>
 
   <t>[EDITORIAL NOTE: FOR NEXT REV - SHOULD WE ADD CALL FLOW FOR FAILURE SCENARIOS DESCRIBED IN 4.1 AND 4.2?] </t>
   
   <t>[EDITORIAL NOTE: ALEX RECOMMENDS WE CLARIFY WHETHER THE DESCRIBED FUNCTIONALITY HERE IS 'ON TOP' OF STANDARD SIP OR NEW FUNCTIONALITY, AND THAT A REF TO THE PROPER SECTION OF RFC3261 IS CONSIDERED]</t>

				   <t>SBE SHOULD use caching of DNS results to eliminate unnecessary DNS queries. </t>
					</section>
					
					<section anchor='ttl' title='TTL' toc='include'>
				   <t>SRV RRs have a TTL value based on which the SBE1 caches the entry for that duration, if it supports caching, and any further requests to the same TARGET domain are delivered to the cached server instance.  The TTL recommended for SRV is about 1 hr.  The TTL for NAPTR is much higher, about 1 day (24hrs) since the NAPTR records do not vary that often as compared to SRV. </t>
