<section title='Introduction' anchor='intro'>

<t>
This paper is a companion to and extension of <xref target='poetzl'/>,
in order to give a more detailed discussion of the implementation of
the "call completion on busy subscriber" and "call completion on no response"
features within SIP<xref target='sip'/>.
It is presented separately from <xref target='poetzl'/> in order to
allow this proposal to be
discussed and refined before integrating it with the more
mature work in <xref target='poetzl'/>.
This paper assumes a familiarity with the concept of the CCBS and CCNR
features, as well as familiarity with the implementation proposed
in <xref target='poetzl'/>.
</t>

</section>

<section title='Outline' anchor='outline'>

<t>
The call-completion architecture augments each caller's UA (or UAC)
which wishes to be able to use the call-completion features with
with a "call-completion agent" (also written as "CC agent", "agent",
or "caller's agent").
It augments each callee's UA (or UAS) which wishes to be able to be the
target of the call-completion features with a "call-completion
monitor" (also written as "CC monitor", "monitor", or "callee's
monitor").
The caller's agent subscribes to the call-completion event
package<xref target='poetzl'/> of the callee's monitor in order to
coordinate with the monitor to implement the call-completion features.
</t>

<t>
When the caller's UA makes a call to a callee that fails (either
because the callee was busy or the callee did not answer), and the
caller wishes to use CCBS or CCNR to contact the callee later, the
caller instructs the caller's agent to activate the CC feature.
</t>

<t>
The caller's agent sends a SUBSCRIBE request for the call-completion
event package to the original
destination URI of the call.  This SUBSCRIBE reaches the callee's
monitor.  The callee's monitor uses the existence of the subscription
to know that the caller is interested in using the CC feature for the
original call.  The monitor keeps a list or queue of failed calls to
the callee, and of the caller's agent subscriptions, which indicate
the callers that are waiting to use the CC features.
</t>

<t>
When the callee UA becomes free in a suitable way for call-completion,
the callee's monitor selects one caller's agent to be the next caller
to execute call-completion.  The callee's monitor sends a
call-completion event update to the selected caller's agent telling
it to begin execution of call-completion.
</t>

<t>
When the caller's agent receives this update, it calls the caller's UA
or otherwise tests whether the caller is available to take advantage
of call-completion.
If the caller is available, the agent directs the caller's UA to make
again the call to the callee.
This call is identified as a call-completion call so it can be given
precedence in reaching the callee's UA.
</t>

</section>

<section title='Detailed Description' anchor='detailed'>

<section title="Caller's Call-Completion Agent" anchor='agent'>

<t>
The call-completion architecture augments each caller's UA (or UAC)
which wishes to be able to use the call-completion features with
with a "call-completion agent".
An agent may be associated with more than one UA if it is common that
a caller or population of users will be shared between the UAs, and
especially if the UAs share an AOR.
</t>

<t>
The caller's agent has a method of monitoring calls made from the
UA(s) in order to determine their Call-Id's and (potentially) their
final response statuses.  This may be achieved by subscribing to the
dialog event package of the UA(s) or by other means.
</t>

<t>
The callers using the UA(s) can indicate to the caller's agent when
they wish to avail themselves of CC for a recently-made call
which failed to reach their chosen destination.
This may be achieved by an INVITE to a special URI which is routed to
the caller's agent or by other means.
</t>

<t>
The caller's agent has a method of monitoring the status of the UA(s)
to determine when they are available to be used for a CC call.
This may be achieved by subscribing to the
dialog event package of the UA(s) or by other means.
</t>

<t>
The caller's agent can communicate to the UA(s) that CC has become
active and to inquire if the relevant calling user is available for
the CC call.
This may be achieved by sending an INVITE to the UA(s) or by other
means.
</t>

<t>
The caller's agent can order the UA(s) at which the relevant calling
user is available to generate a CC call to the callee.
This may be achieved by sending a REFER to the UA(s) or by other
means.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Callee's Call-Completion Monitor" anchor='monitor'>

<t>
The call-completion architecture augments 
callee's UA (or UAS) which wishes to be able to be the
target of the call-completion features with a "call-completion
monitor".
A monitor may be associated with more than one UA if it is common that
a callee or population of users will be shared between the UAs, and
especially if the UAs share an AOR.
</t>

<t>
The callee's monitor has a method of monitoring calls made to the
UA(s) in order to determine their Call-Id's and (potentially) their
final response statuses.  This may be achieved by subscribing to the
dialog event package of the UA(s) or by other means (e.g., by
communication with the UA's "home proxy").
</t>

<t>
The callee's using the UA(s) may be able to indicate to the callee's
monitor when
they wish  to receive CC calls.
This may be achieved by an INVITE to a special URI which is routed to
the callee's monitor or by other means.
</t>

<t>
The callee's monitor has a method of monitoring the status of the UA(s)
to determine when they are in a suitable state
to receive a CC call.
This state may vary depending on the type of CC call in question.
E.g., a UA is available for CCBS when it is not busy, but a UA is
available for CCNR when it becomes not busy after being busy with an
established call.
This monitoring may be achieved by subscribing to the
dialog event package of the UA(s) or by other means.
</t>

<t>
The callee's monitor maintains information about the set of INVITEs
that have been received by the UA(s) that did not obtain successful
final responses.
In practice, the monitor may remove knowledge about an incoming dialog
from its set if its CC policy establishes that the dialog is no longer
eligible for CC.
</t>

</section>

<section title="The Original Call Is Made" anchor='original-made'>

<t>
The caller's UA sends an INVITE to a request URI.
One or more forks of this request reach one or more of the callee's
UAs.
By hypothesis, none of the callee's UAs returns a success response, as
otherwise, call completion services would not be needed for this call.
However, the caller's INVITE might succeed at some other UA that the
calling user considers insufficient to satisfy his needs.  E.g., a
call that is not answered by the callee user may connect to the callee
user's voicemail server.
Eventually, the INVITE fails, or the resulting dialog(s) are
terminated.
Note that the Call-Id of the INVITE is a unique identifier of this
call attempt.
</t>

<t>
The caller's agent records the request URI, the Call-Id, and possibly
the final request status that the caller's UA received.
The callee's monitor records the Call-Id and possibly the final
request status(es) returned by the callee's UA(s).
</t>

<t>
Note that the caller's UA may not receive any response from any of the
callee's UA(s), as the final response returned to the caller's UA may
have been from a fork that reached a UA that was not the callee's.
</t>

</section>

<section title='Call-Completion Is Invoked' anchor='invoked'>

<t>
The calling user indicates to the caller's agent that he wishes to
invoke call-completion services on the recent call.
Note that from the SIP point of view, the INVITE may be successful,
but from the user's point of view, the call may be unsuccessful.
E.g., the call may have connected to the callee's voicemail, which
would return a 200 status to the INVITE but from the caller's
point of view is "no reply".
</t>

<t>
Question:  At this point, it seems that the best choice is that the
caller's agent need not determine what type of CC is being requested
(CCNR vs. CCBS), as (1) it cannot determine this from the INVITE final
response, (2) it would be a burden to make the calling user to specify
it, and (3) the callee's monitor can determine this from the responses
returned by the callee's UAs.
</t>

<t>
The caller's agent subscribes to the call-completion event
package<xref target='poetzl'/> using the request URI of the original
call.
This SUBSCRIBE should be routed in much the same way as the original
INVITE, but ultimately being routed not to the callee's UAs but to the
callee's monitor.
The Event header of the subscribe specifies the call-completion event
package with a parameter "call_id=[Call-Id of the original call]".
</t>

<t>
Question:  Should the specification of the original call be done in
the SUBSCRIBE body rather than in an event-param?
</t>

<t>
The SUBSCRIBE should have headers to optimize its routing.
In particular, it should contain "Request-Disposition: parallel,
no-cancel", and an Accept-Contact header to eliminate callee UAs that
are not acceptable to the calling user.<xref target='preferences'/>
</t>

<t>
The callee's monitor(s) that receive the SUBSCRIBE establish
subscriptions.
These subscriptions represent the caller's agent's request for
call-completion services.
The callee's monitor must be prepared to receive multiple forks of a
single SUBSCRIBE, and should respond 482 (Merged Request) to all but
one fork.
The callee's monitor must be prepared to receive SUBSCRIBEs regarding
original calls that it has no knowledge of, and should respond 404
(Not Found) to such SUBSCRIBEs.
The monitor may apply additional restrictions as to which caller's
agents may subscribe.
</t>

<t>
The caller's agent must be prepared to receive multiple responses to
the SUBSCRIBE and to have multiple subscriptions established.
The agent must also be prepared to have the SUBSCRIBE fail, in which
case, CC cannot be invoked for this original call.
</t>

<t>
The call-completion event package returns various information to the
caller's agent, but the vital datum is that it contains an indication
whether the callee's monitor has chosen the caller's agent to perform
the next CC call to the callee.
This datum is initially false.
</t>

</section>

<section title='The Call-Completion Request Is Queued' anchor='maintained'>

<t>
The continuation of the caller's agent's subscription indicates that
the caller's agent is prepared to initiate the CC call when it is
selected by the callee's monitor.
If the caller's agent becomes unwilling to initiate the CC call
(e.g., because the calling
user has deactivated CC or because the caller's UA becomes busy), the
caller's agent must terminate or suspend the subscription(s).
(Currently, no method of suspending a subscription is defined.)
If the caller's agent later becomes willing again to initiate CC for the
original call, it may resume the suspended subscription(s) or initiate 
new one(s).
</t>

<t>
If the callee's monitor becomes aware that, according to its policy,
the original call referenced by a subscription will never be selected
for call-completion, it should terminate the subscription.  (And
respond to any attempt to start a new subscription for that original
call with 404.)
</t>

</section>

<section title='Call-Completion Is Activated' anchor='activated'>

<t>
The callee's monitor has a policy regarding when and how it selects
CC requests to be activated.
This policy may take into account the type of the requests (CCNR
vs. CCBS), the state
of the callee's UA(s), the order in which the original
calls arrived, and any previous CC attempts for the same original
call.
Usually the callee's monitor will choose only one CC request for
activation at a time, but if the callee's UA(s) can support multiple
calls, it may choose more than one.
</t>

<t>
The callee's monitor changes the "call completion active" datum for
the chosen caller's agent from false to true.  This triggers a
notification for the agent's subscription.
</t>

<t>
The agent receives the notification with the CC active datum set to
true.
It then terminates or suspends all other CC subscriptions for this
original call, and all CC subscriptions for all other original calls,
in order to prevent any other CC requests from this caller from being
activated.
The agent then determines whether the calling user is available for
the CC call, usually by calling the caller's UA(s).
</t>

<t>
If the calling user is not available, the caller's agent indicates
this to the callee's monitor by terminating the CC subscription.
</t>

<t>
If the calling user is available, the caller's agent causes the
caller's UA to initiate a call to the request URI (which is expected
to be routed to the callee's UA(s)).
</t>

<t>
Question:  Should the callee's monitor supply a URI which should be
used in the CC call?  This seems like it would be more reliable, as
the monitor is probably "for" a particular callee URI, and it has no
information about the destinations of any other forks of the original
call.
</t>

<t>
Question:  The CC must be marked in some way as a CC call in order for
the callee's monitor to know that the CC activation is being acted
upon by the caller's agent.
And the marking must include the original Call-Id to allow
correlation with the original call.
Possibilities for a marking are a special URI-parameter on the request
URI or a special header.
</t>

<t>
The callee's UA(s) and any associated proxies may give the CC call
precedence over non-CC calls.
</t>

<t>
The callee's monitor supervises the receiving of the CC call.
If the CC call does not arrive at the callee's UA(s) promptly, the
monitor will withdraw CC activation from the caller's agent by
changing the value of its CC active datum to false.
Similarly, if the CC call fails, the monitor will withdraw CC
activation.  Depending on its policy, the same original call may be
selected again for CC activation at a later time.
If the CC call succeeds, the monitor will also withdraw CC activation,
but the original call will never again be selected for CC activation
(and in practice, can be deleted from the monitor's records).
</t>

<t>
Question:  Is that last statement true?  Can a call appear to succeed
from the monitor's point of view but fail from the calling user's
point of view?
</t>

<t>
Once the CC call has failed, or if it has succeeded, once the CC call
has been terminated, the callee's monitor's policy may select another
CC request for activation.
</t>

</section>

<section title='Data Provided in the Call-Completion Event Package'
         anchor='package'>

<t>
Question:  What format should the event package data be presented  in?
<xref target='poetzl'/> proposes a simple attribute-value format.
We might also consider yet another XML format.
</t>

<t>
The only necessary information to be provided by the call-completion
event package is the CC activation datum, whose value is false
(meaning that this CC request has not been chosen for activation) or
true (meaning that it has).
</t>

<t>
Question:  If we decide to let the callee's monitor provide the
request URI for the CC call, that request URI should probably be a
mandatory datum as well.
</t>

<t>
The event package may provide information about the callee's monitor's
policy.  In particular, the PSTN CC feature gives an indication of the
"service retention" attribute, which indicates whether the CC request
can be continued to a later time if the call-completion call fails due
to the callee's UA(s) being busy.<xref target='poetzl'/>
</t>

<t>
If the callee has a caller-queuing facility, we want to treat the
call-completion queue as part of the queuing facility,  and include
in the event package information regarding the state of the queue,
such as number of callers ahead of this caller and expected wait time.
In that case, this data should probably not trigger a notification
every time it changes, but rather at suitable time increments.
</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>

<t>
The use of the CC facility allows the caller's agent to determine some
status information regarding the callee.
The information is confined to a busy/not-busy indication, and
is to a considerable degree protected by the necessity of presenting
the Call-Id of a recent call to the callee in order to obtain
information.
</t>

<t>
The CC facility may enhance the effectiveness of SPIT by the following
technique:
The caller makes calls to a group of targets.  The caller then
requests CC for the calls that do not connect to the targets.
The CC calls resulting are probably more likely to reach the targets
than original calls to a further group of targets.
