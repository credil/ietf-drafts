Internet-Draft                Auto Response                 October 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document describes how the Sieve email filtering language
   [RFC5228], along with some extensions [RFC5230] [RFC5435]
   [I-D.ietf-sieve-external-lists] [I-D.ietf-sieve-notify-presence]
   [I-D.ietf-sieve-vacation-seconds] can be used to generate automatic
   replies to incoming electronic mail messages based on the presence
   information of the recipient.  This can be used, for example, to
   inform the sender that messages will not be answered immediately
   because the recipient is busy or away.

   The auto-reply message can additionally be based on information about
   the sender from the recipient's address book, sub-lists therefrom, or
   other lists available to the recipient, so that different senders
   might get different responses.  The recipient can create separate
   rules for friends, family members, colleagues, and so on.

   This can be used in mail filtering software, email-based information
   services, and other automatic responder situations.  There are many
   programs currently in use that automatically respond to email.  Some
   of them send many useless or unwanted responses, or send responses to
   inappropriate addresses.  The mechanism described herein will help to
   avoid those problems (but see the discussion in Section 4).
   Implementations need to take care of tracking previous messages
   received from the same sender and they will start or stop sending
   responses as the presence status of the recipient changes.


2.  How To Create Auto Replies

   When an email message arrives, the Sieve script can use the
   notify_method_capability of the Notify extension [RFC5435] to check
   the recipient's presence information.  The Notify-presence extension
   [I-D.ietf-sieve-notify-presence] makes additional presence, such as
   "away" and "do not disturb" status, available.  The script can use
   the External-lists extension [I-D.ietf-sieve-external-lists] to look
   the sender up in the recipient's address book or other list.  If the
   information retrieved warrants an auto-reply message, the message can
   then be composed based on that information.

   The Vacation extension [RFC5230] provides an easy way to send the
   auto-reply message to the sender, as it automatically keeps track of
   the automatic replies and attempts to avoid excessive messages and
   mail loops.  The Vacation-seconds extension
   [I-D.ietf-sieve-vacation-seconds] allows auto-replies to be sent this
   way more frequently than once per day, when that's appropriate.
   (Alternatively, the script can use the Notify extension,[RFC5435] and
   it can use that to send a notification by a means other than email.)

Internet-Draft                Auto Response                 October 2010


   Personal and Group Responders can refuse to generate responses except
   to known correspondents or addresses otherwise known to the
   recipient.  Such responders can also generate different kinds of
   responses for "trusted" vs "untrusted" addresses.  This might be
   useful, for instance, to avoid inappropriate disclosure of personal
   or confidential information to arbitrary addresses.


3.  Example Use Cases for Auto Replies

   1.  In this example, we check that the envelope "from" is in the
       recipient's address book [I-D.ietf-sieve-external-lists] and that
       the recipient's presence shows "extended
       away".[I-D.ietf-sieve-notify-presence] If both of those are true,
       the "vacation" action [RFC5230] is used to send an auto-reply,
       making sure we don't reply to the same sender more than once
       every half hour.[I-D.ietf-sieve-vacation-seconds] The variables
       extension [RFC5229] is used to extract the value of the
       recipient's natural-language presence status message, which will
       be used as the response to the sender.


   require ["envelope", "extlists", "enotify", "variables",
            "vacation-seconds"];
   if allof (
       envelope :list "from" "tag:example.com,2009-05-28:AddrBook",
       notify_method_capability "xmpp:me@example.com" "show" "xa"
     ) {
       # :matches "*" is used here to extract the value
       if notify_method_capability :matches
           "xmpp:myjid@example.com" "status" "*" {
         set "resp_msg" "${1}";
       } else {
         set "resp_msg" "Away for a while, without access to email.";
       }
       vacation :handle "ext-away" :seconds 1800 "${resp_msg}";
     }




   2.  In the next example, we'll check several lists or sublists, auto-
       replying to everyone, but sending more detail about the
       recipient's status to senders who are found in the recipient's
       address book, and still more detail to those in the "family" and
       "friends" lists.

   require ["envelope", "extlists", "enotify", "vacation-seconds"];

   if envelope :list "from" ["tag:example.com,2009-05-28:family",
                             "tag:example.com,2009-05-28:friends"]
     {
       if notify_method_capability "xmpp:me@example.com" "show" "away"
         {
           vacation :handle "away" :seconds 600
               "I'm away for now, but I'll be back soon.";
         }
       elsif notify_method_capability "xmpp:me@example.com" "show" "dnd"
         {
           vacation :handle "dnd" :seconds 1800
               "I'm not to be disturbed.  I'll check mail later.";
         }
       elsif notify_method_capability "xmpp:me@example.com" "show" "xa"
         {
           vacation :handle "ext-away" :seconds 3600
               "I'm away for a while, without access to email.";
         }
       elsif notify_method_capability "xmpp:me@example.com" "busy" "yes"
         {
           vacation :handle "busy" :seconds 1800
               "I'm very busy, but might check email now and then.";
         }
     }
   elsif envelope :list "from" "tag:example.com,2009-05-28:AddrBook"
     {
       if notify_method_capability "xmpp:me@example.com" "show"
              ["away", "dnd", "xa"]
         {
           vacation :handle "away" :seconds 3600
               "I'm not available to respond to email.";
         }
     }
   else # the sender is not in the address book
     {
       vacation :handle "catchall" :days 1
           "I got your message, and might read it eventually.";
     }




   3.  For this example, if the sender is a work colleague and the
       recipient is on extended away status, then reply with a message
       giving alternative contact information.  The message might also
       include details about the reason for the absence, or other

       personal or confidential information that shouldn't be shared
       with senders who aren't associated with the recipient's company.


   require ["envelope", "extlists", "enotify", "vacation"];

   if envelope :list "from" "tag:example.com,2009-05-28:co-workers"
     {
       if notify_method_capability "xmpp:me@example.com" "show" "xa"
         {
           vacation :handle "bigtrip" :days 3
               "I'm on an extended business trip to Texas for the Foo
                project.  Contact my backup, Susan <susan@example.com>,
                or call my assistant on +1 666 555 1234 if you urgently
                need to contact me.";
         }
     }




   4.  This example is used to send an acknowledgment to every message
       received.  A :seconds value of zero is used to reply to every
       message, with no removal of duplicates to the same sender.  This
       requires that the Sieve engine allow an interval of zero; if it
       does not, and it imposes a minimum value, not every message will
       receive an auto-reply.


   require ["envelope", "extlists", "vacation-seconds"];

   if not envelope :list "from" "tag:example.com,2009-05-28:staff"
     {
       vacation :handle "auto-resp" :seconds 0
           "Your request has been received.  A service
            representative will contact you as soon as
            possible, usually within one business day.";
     }




   5.  This example uses the same structure to automatically send a copy
       of each incoming message to the recipient's backup, if the sender
       is a customer contact or co-worker, or if the message's subject
       includes the word "urgent".

4.  Security Considerations

   See the Security Considerations sections of the following
   specifications for discussion of security considerations not covered
   here:
   Sieve base specification [RFC5228]
   Sieve Vacation extension [RFC5230]
   Vacation "Seconds" parameter [I-D.ietf-sieve-vacation-seconds]
   Sieve Externally Stored Lists extension
   [I-D.ietf-sieve-external-lists]
   Sieve Notify extension [RFC5435] (and any applicable notification
   methods)

   This document describes how to set up a system that creates automatic
   replies in an intelligent way.  Despite the "intelligence", errors in
   scripts can result in too many auto-reply messages, especially when
   the reply interval is minimal (using the "notify" action, or the
   "vacation" action with a small value for ":seconds").

   Despite the "intelligence", too, errors in scripts can result in
   private information getting to senders inappropriately.  In example 3
   in Section 3, for instance, if the :list test checks the wrong list,
   or none at all, information about the recipient's business trip might
   be sent to someone who has no need to know about it, and shouldn't.

   Even without errors in scripts, a sender who recognizes that auto-
   replies are dependent upon the recipient's presence can use that fact
   to probe the presence information.  One result of that can be that
   the sender discerns changes in the recipient's presence that the



George, et al.           Expires April 15, 2011                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                Auto Response                 October 2010


   sender would normally not be allowed to see, making this an
   unintentional back door into the user's presence information.
   Another result is that this can create a "covert channel", allowing
   the recipient to send information to a sender by changing his
   presence information, his address book, and/or his Sieve script
   (though in this regard, the exposure is comparable to any other case
   of shared presence information).

   Finally, users of any auto-reply mechanism should really think about
   whether automatic replies are necessary, and at what interval they
   make sense when they are.  Email is not Instant Messaging, and
   senders generally expect that replies might take a while.  Consider
   whether it's truly important to tell people that you'll read their
   mail in an hour or so, or whether that can just be taken as how email
   works.  There are times when this makes sense, but let's not use it
   to exacerbate information overload.
