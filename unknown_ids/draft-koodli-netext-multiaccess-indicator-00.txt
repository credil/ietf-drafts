                Multi-access Indicator for Flow Mobility
            draft-koodli-netext-multiaccess-indicator-00.txt

Abstract

   When a Mobile Node attaches to the mobile network using multiple
   access networks, it is important for the Mobile Network Gateway to
   know whether the Mobile Node is capable of simultaneous multi-access,
   so that the former can distribute the traffic flows using the most
   appropriate interface.  This document defines a new EAP attribute
   which can be used for such an indication to the Mobile Network
   Gateway.

Internet-Draft  Multi-access Indicator for Flow Mobility    October 2010


1.  Introduction

   With multi-access, a Mobile Node (MN) may be simultaneously attached
   to a mobile network.  For instance, in the 3GPP architecture, a MN
   may be attached to the same Mobile Network Gateway (called PGW) via
   4G cellular LTE technology as well as the Wireless LAN (WiFI)
   technology.  Such simultaneous access provides opportunity to
   distribute traffic based on the most appropriate access for the type
   of traffic in question (and potentially based on the Time Of the
   Day).  In order to accomplish this flow distribution (or flow
   mobility), the MNG needs to know that the MN's attachment is for
   multi-access (and not handover) purposes and that the MN has
   necessary host abstractions to support prefix sharing across access
   interfaces.  This document defines an attribute to be used during the
   EAP-AKA authentication process so that the 3GPP AAA server
   understands the MN's capabilities.  Subsequently, the 3GPP AAA server
   provides the MN's capabilities in the Diameter message to the PGW,
   which can then make the policy decision to perform flow mobility
   accordingly.


2.  Protocol Overview and Extensions

   In the 3GPP architecture [3gpp.4g-2], two types of "non-3GPP"
   accesses are supported.  In the trusted access model, the access
   network is considered trustworthy by the 3GPP network operator.  An
   example of a trusted network is another cellular network such as CDMA
   or WiMax, but may also include broadband wireline network with WiFi
   access (such as a residential access network operated by the 3GPP
   cellular service provider).  In the untrusted access model, the 3GPP
   service provider does not possess a trust relationship with the non-
   3GPP access provider.  An example includes WiFi hot spot access.

   In the trusted access model, the MN communicates with an Access
   Network Gateway (ANG).  In the untrusted access model, the MN
   communicates with a node called ePDG that serves as a secure data
   termination point.  In both the trusted and untrusted access models,
   the MN performs EAP-AKA or EAP-AKA' authentication.  In the trusted
   access model, the EAP-AKA messages are transported from the MN to the
   ANG over a protocol specific to the access network.  In the untrusted
   access model, the EAP-AKA messages are transported from the MN to the
   ePDG over IKEv2.  Both the ANG and the ePDG communicate with the
   (3GPP) AAA server using Diameter.  This is shown in Figure 1, which
   we explain further below.

                 Figure 1: Authentication and Registration

      o The MN attaches to the non-3GPP access network

      o The MN performs EAP-AKA or EAP-AKA' authentication.  The EAP
      messages are sent over IKEv2 when the MN is connected using
      untrusted access.

      o As a part of the EAP-AKA procedure, the MN responds with EAP-
      Response/AKA-Challenge message.  In this message, the MN includes
      a new attribute AT_MA_IND which indicates that the MN's attachment
      is for multi-access purposes, and that the MN supports the
      necessary abstraction (Logical Interface) for flow mobility.

      o The ANG/ePDG forward the EAP message to the AAA server using the
      Diameter protocol message Authorization Request (AAR) message
      specified in [RFC4005].

      o The 3GPP AAA server verifies through subscription records (at
      HSS) that the the MN is allowed to use flow mobility.
      Subsequently, the AAA server provides the result in a new EAP
      attribute AT_MA_STATUS in the EAP-Request/AKA-Notification message
      (which is used for indicating the IP Mobility Selection mode).
      The EAP message sent using the Diameter Authorization Answer (AAA)
      message to the ANG/ePDG, which forwards the EAP message to the MN.

      o The ANG/ePDG sends the PMIP6 PBU message

      o The PGW contacts the AAA server to update the PGW's address for
      the MN's connection

      o The AAA server provides the MN's multi-access indication and
      Logical Interface capability in a new MN_MULTIACCESS
      (0x0000000000000003) flag in the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP
      [RFC5447].

      o The PGW now understands that the MN is capable of flow mobility.
      It provides a prefix in the PBA accordingly.  For instance, it may
      provide a new prefix as well as one or more of the already-
      assigned prefixes in the PBA.

      o The ANG/ePDG MUST be able to provide forwarding support for the
      prefixes provided in the PBA, regardless of the type of attachment
      indicated in the PBU message.



3.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new flag for the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP in
   RFC 5447, which may need IANA assignment.


4.  Security Considerations

   This documents defines a new EAP attribute to extend the capability
   of EAP-AKA protocol as specified in Section 8.2 of RFC 4187
   [RFC4187].  This attribute is passed from the MN to the AAA server.
   The document does not specify any new messages or options to the EAP-
   AKA protocol.
