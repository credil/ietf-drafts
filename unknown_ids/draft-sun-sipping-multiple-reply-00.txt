Internet-Draft        Multiple Reply in SIP MESSAGE            July 2007


Abstract

   This document defines extensions to the Reply-To header field for
   MESSAGE so that it can be used to specify multiple addresses as the
   target of reply MESSAGE.  These extensions include the use of
   pointers to Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)-lists in the Reply-To
   header field and the "multiple-reply" SIP option-tag.

Internet-Draft        Multiple Reply in SIP MESSAGE            July 2007


1.  Introduction

   RFC 3261 [2] defines a Reply-To header field containing a logical
   return URI that may be different from the From header field.  For
   example, the URI MAY be used to return missed calls or unestablished
   sessions.

   RFC 3428 [3] further defines the Reply-To as an optional header field
   that can be used and present in MESSAGE requests and responses.  This
   allows the Reply-Issuer to provide Reply-Recipient with one User
   Agent (UA) as the target of reply MESSAGE.

   However in some scenarios, the Reply-Issuer may want the Reply-
   Recipient to send reply MESSAGE to a list of UAs.  For example, a
   manager sends a message to notify the secretary to prepare a meeting.
   At the same time the manager provides the list of attendees in the
   message.  Whenever the meeting is arranged the secretary can send
   meeting information in reply message to the list of attendees.
   Another use case may be that a scheduled reminder application sends a
   message to a user, the message informs the user should send some
   information, such as weekly project report, to a list of users while
   the notification itself is not meaningful for the intended
   recipients.

   This specification extends the above Reply-To mechanim to fullfil
   this requirement.  The Reply-Issuer sends a MESSAGE request which
   contains the Reply-To header field pointing to a URI-List (Uniform
   Resource Identifier list) as the targets of reply MESSAGE to a Reply-
   Recipient.

   The Reply-Recipient may modify the provided list to add or remove
   recipients.

   The Reply-Recipient can create a reply MESSAGE request for each entry
   in the URI-List and send them respectively or send a reply MESSAGE to
   MESSAGE URI-list service [9] to distribute the reply MESSAGE
   requests.

   The requirements to support multiple reply may be summarized as
   follows:

      REQ-1: It MUST be possible for a Reply-Issuer to specify multiple
      reply targets in a MESSAGE request, where the identities of the
      reply targets are carried in the request itself.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1]

   This document defines the following new terms:

      Reply-Issuer: the user agent issuing the SIP request with Reply-To
      header field.

      Reply-Recipient: the user agent receiving the SIP request with
      Reply-To header field.

3.  URI-List Document Format

   As described in the Framework and Security Considerations for SIP
   URI-List Services [4] , specifications of individual URI-list
   services, need to specify a default format for 'recipient-list'
   bodies used within the particular service.

   The default format for 'recipient-list' bodies for multiple reply is
   XML Resource Lists [7] extended with Copy Control Attribute [8] .
   Reply-Issuer and Reply-Recipient MUST support both of these formats
   and MAY support other formats.

   As described in Copy Control Attribute [8] , each URI can be tagged
   with a 'copyControl' attribute set to either "to", "cc", or "bcc",
   indicating the role in which the recipient will get the MESSAGE
   request.  Additionally, URIs can be tagged with the 'anonymize'
   attribute to prevent that the Reply-Recipient (UAS) discloses the
   target URI in a URI-list.

   In addition, the XML Resource Lists [7] defines a 'recipient-list-
   history' body that contains the list of recipients.  The default
   format for 'recipient-list-history' bodies for UAs is also the XML
   Resource Lists [7] extended with the Copy Control Attribute [8] .  If
   the Reply-Recipient sends the reply MESSAGE requests for each entry
   in the URI-List, it may provide 'recipient-list-history' body in the
   reply MESSAGE requests.  In this case the Reply-Recipient MAY support
   these formats and MAY support others.  If the Reply-Recipient sends
   the reply MESSAGE request to MESSAGE URI-list service [9] , it does
   not need to support these formats.  UAs able to understand
   'recipient-list-history' MUST support these formats and MAY support
   others.

   Nevertheless, the XML Resource Lists [7] provides features, such as
   hierarchical lists and the ability to include entries by reference
   relative to the XCAP root URI, that are not needed by the multiple
   reply mechanism defined in this document, which only needs to
   transfer a flat list of URIs between the Reply-Issuer and the Reply-
   Recipient.  Therefore, when using the default resource list document,
   UAs SHOULD use flat lists (i.e., no hierarchical lists) and SHOULD
   NOT use elements.  A Reply-Recipient receiving a URI-list with more
   information than what has just been described MAY discard all the
   extra information.

   Figure 1 shows an example of a flat list that follows XML Resource
   Lists [7] extended with Copy Control Attribute [8] ).

4.  Option-tag

   This document defines a new SIP option-tag for the Require and
   Supported header fields: "multiple-reply".  A UA including the
   "multiple-reply" option-tag in a Supported header field indicates
   compliance with this specification.

   A UA generating a MESSAGE request with a pointer to a URI-list in its
   Reply-To header field MUST include the "multiple-reply" option-tag in
   the Require header field of the MESSAGE request.

5.  Procedures at the Reply-Issuer

   A Reply-Issuer that wants to specify multiple reply addresses MUST be
   formatted according to Section 4 of RFC 3428 [3] .  The Reply-Issuer
   populates the Request-URI with the SIP or SIPS URI of the Reply-
   Recipient.  In addition to the regular MESSAGE body, the Reply-Issuer
   adds a recipient-list body whose Content-Disposition type is
   'recipient-list' as defined in Framework and Security Considerations
   for SIP URI-List Services [4] .  This body contains a URI-list with
   the recipients of the reply MESSAGE from the Reply-Recipient.  Target
   URIs in this body MAY also be tagged with the 'copyControl' and
   'anonymize' attributes specified in the Copy Control Attribute [8] .
   The Reply-Issuer MUST provide an appropriate Content-ID for the
   recipient-list body and populates the Reply-To with the value of
   Content-ID which identifies the list of intended recipient of reply
   message.  The Reply-Issuer MUST also include the 'multiple-reply'
   option-tag, defined in Section 4, in a Require header field.

   the Reply-Issuer MAY use the "?" mechanism described in Section
   19.1.1 of RFC 3261 [2] to encode extra information in any URI in the
   list.  The following is an example of a URI that uses the "?"
   mechanism:
   sip:bob@example.com?Accept-Contact=*%3bmobility%3d%22mobile%22

   The previous URI requests the Reply-Recipient to add the following
   header field to a reply MESSAGE request to be sent to
   bob@example.com: Accept-Contact: *;mobility="mobile"

6.  Procedures at the Reply-Recipient

   A Reply-Recipient that is able to receive and process MESSAGE
   requests with a Reply-To header field and 'recipient-list' body MUST
   include a 'multiple-reply' option-tag in a Supported header field
   when responding to OPTIONS requests.

   A Reply-Recipient that receives a MESSAGE request with a Reply-To
   header field and 'recipient-list' body processes it and responds
   following the precedure in section 7 of RFC 3428 [3]

   There are two possibilities for Reply-Recipient to send reply MESSAGE
   requests to intended recipients:

   o  The Reply-Recipient creates a reply MESSAGE request for each entry
      in the URI-List and send them respectively.  If it supports
      'recipient-list-history' Content-Disposition type it MAY provide a
      'recipient-list-history' body in the reply MESSAGE requests for
      each intended recipient following the procedure defined in Copy
      Control Attribute [8] .

   o  The Reply-Recipient sends a reply MESSAGE request that includes
      the payload along with the URI-list to the MESSAGE URI-list
      service [9] to distribute the simliar reply MESSAGE requests to
      each of the URIs included in the list.  The Reply-Recipient MAY
      modify the URI-list from Reply-Issuer to add or remove recipients.

   request with Reply-To header field pointing to a URI list to a Reply-
   Recipient.  The Reply-Recipient sends a reply MESSAGE with the URI
   list to MESSAGE URI-list service.

      recipients receving the reply MESSAGE request from Reply-
      Recipient.

   The Reply-To header field has the same value of Content-ID pointing
   to the URI-List which contains the intended recipients.

8.  Security Considerations

   URI-lists may contain private information, such as SIP URIs.  It is
   therefore not desirable that these URI-lists are known by third
   parties.  Eavesdroppers are able to watch URI-lists contained in SIP
   requests unless the SIP message is sent over a secured channel, by
   using any of the available SIP mechanisms, such as Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) [5] , or unless the URI-list body itself is encrypted
   with, e.g., S/MIME [6] .  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that URI-list
   bodies are encrypted with S/MIME [6] or that the SIP request is
   encrypted with TLS [5] or any other suitable encryption mechanism.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the 'multiple-reply' SIP option-tag.  It should
   be registered in the Option Tags subregistry under the SIP parameter
   registry.  The following is the description to be used in the
   registration.


   +------------------------+------------------------------+-----------+
   | Name                   | Description                  | Reference |
   +------------------------+------------------------------+-----------+
   | multiple-reply         | The body contains the        | [RFC XXXX]|
   |                        | inten contains the intended  |           |
   |                        | recipients receving the      |           |
   |                        | reply MESSAGE request from   |           |
   |                        | Reply-Recipient.             |           |
