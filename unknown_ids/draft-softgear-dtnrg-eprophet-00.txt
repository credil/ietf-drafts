Abstract 

   This document defines extensions of PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing 
   Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity. The document 
   presents two extensions of current PRoPHET draft-09. The first 
   extension is to apply the contact duration to calculate the delivery 
   predictability. The other is to provide a forward strategy which can 
   alleviate the bundle starving problem.

1. Introduction 

   PRoPHET is a variant of the epidemic routing protocol for 
   intermittently connected networks without flooding. PRoPHET is 
   designed for DTNs(Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network) which are 
   intermittently connected networks. The PRoPHET draft-09 have been 
   submitted on April 3, 2011[I-D.irtf-dtnrg-prophet-09]. 

   In PRoPHET draft-09, when two nodes meet, they update the delivery 
   predictability for each other using the following equation. 

   P_(A,B) = P_(A,B)_old + (1-delta-P_(A,B)_old)*P_encounter   (1) 

   To reduce the distortion of the delivery predictability if the 
   contact occurs very short and frequent, PRoPHET draft-09 suggests the 
   P_encounter function of interval to decrease the predictability for 
   interval is shorter than the typical time(I_typ). 

   However, the calculation of the predictability in PRoPHET draft-09 
   does not consider the contact duration when interval is longer. This 
   document describes this problem and suggest to use a P_encounter 
   function of the contact duration but interval. 

   PRoPHET and [lindgren_06] provides several forward strategies. the 
   overlay. All strategies are in a kind of priority queue scheduling. 
   Therefore, bundles in a lower priority queue may be starved by 
   bundles in a higher priority queue. When the total departure rate is 
   smaller than the total arrival rate, the queues will be fulfilled and 
   some bundles are dropped. If we use a priority queue scheduling, the 
   lower priority queue will not be served forever. 

   This document provides a forward strategy which can reduce the 
   starving using the expiration of the bundle. It combines the 
   predictability value for the destination of the bundle and the 
   expiration of the bundle. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3. Contact Duration based P_encounter function 

3.1. Overview 

   Delivery Predictability P_(A,B) is based on the history of encounter 
   between node A and B which is reflected in the equation (1) [I-
   D.irtf-dtnrg-prophet-09]. It is intuitively reasonable that the 
   longer, and the relatively more stable the encounter nodes have with 
   their neighbors is, the higher Delivery Predictability values should 
   be. For example if node A keeps in contact with node B for 10 seconds 
   and it also has 5 times of 2 second long contacts with node C, 
   P_(A,B) should be larger than P_(A,C). The different duration of 
   contact nodes have must make Delivery Predictabilities different. 
   However the Delivery Predictability equations introduced in [I-
   D.irtf-dtnrg-prophet-09] do not have this feature properly (constant 
   P_encounter, CST). In order to remove the distortion of the Delivery 
   Predictability value which is caused by several communication 
   opportunities closely spaced in time due to wireless physical 
   characteristic, P_encounter is proposed to be a function of the 
   interval since the last encounter in Fig. 2 from [I-D.irtf-dtnrg-
   prophet-09] (contact interval based P_encounter, CIB).  Nevertheless, 
   it still does not reflect the duration of contact. 

3.2. Contact Duration Time Considered Delivery Predictability 

   The Delivery Predictability value for the node which guarantees 
   stably long enough contact time must be larger than that for the node 
   which does not, as mentioned in the previous section. Therefore we 
   propose to make P_encounter a function of contact time duration as 
   follows. 

   P_encounter(t)=P_encounter_max * (1 - e^(-epsilon * t))         (2) 

   where t is the sum of contact duration since the last calculation, 
   epsilon is a contact differentiating constant, and P_encounter_max is  
   the limiting value for P_encounter from '0' to '1' (contact duration 
   time based P_encounter, CDB). 

   To analyze the proposed delivery predictability calculation, we 
   assume an opportunistic link between nodes A and B. we set a contact 
   differentiating constant (epsilon) low (0.1) enough to punish the 
   short contact durations. I_typ for CIB is set to 10 seconds due to 
   average time between transfer opportunities, and we use 1 second time 
   unit for delivery predictability aging equation. Three contact 
   scenarios can be considered: 'short interval & short contact', 'short 
   interval & normal contact' and 'long interval & short contact'.

   The first scenario of 'short interval & short contact' shows that 
   Delivery Predictability with CST is rapidly increasing because it has 
   constant P_encounter. However other two methods, CIB and our CDB, 
   avoid the Delivery Predictability distortion by increasing Delivery 
   Predictability slightly, because these reflect contact interval and 
   contact duration respectively. 

   In the second scenario where relatively stable contact but still 
   short contact intervals take place, CIB keeps its Delivery 
   Predictability's increment as low as node B is considered to be 
   inappropriate one for delivery the bundle to the destination. In 
   contrast, the proposed CDB scheme rapidly considers the contact 
   duration and raises the possibility of forwarding the bundle to the 
   node B. 

   The last scenario is that the contact interval is very long but 
   contact duration is short. Both CIB and the proposed CDB reflect the 
   number of contacts into Delivery Predictability calculation and 
   result in high Delivery Predictability value. On the contrary, the 
   Delivery Predictability value is kept still low under the proposed 
   scheme, because of short contact duration. Therefore we see that it 
   is very important to reflect contact duration into Delivery 
   Predictability calculation to in order to reduce Delivery 
   Predictability distortion. 

    

4. Expiration based Forwarding Strategy 

   In PRoPHET, nodes decide on which bundles they wish to exchange with 
   the peer node during the information exchange phase. PRoPHET draft-09 
   describes 7 basic forward strategies : GRTR, GTMX, GTHR, GRTR+, GTMX+, 
   GRTRSort, and GRTRMax.  

   The node which sending a bundle does not delete the bundle after 
   sending it as long as there is sufficient buffer space available. 
   However, when the total departure rate is smaller than the total 
   arrival rate, the queues will be fulfilled and some bundles are 
   dropped. The departure rate is the total effective bandwidth from 
   this node to other nodes when the forwarding condition in such a  
   forwarding strategy is satisfied. Because all strategies are in a 
   kind of priority queue scheduling, the bundles to the specific 
   destination will be discarded. 

   For the fairness, the bundle which has short expiration and has been 
   served rarely should be served before the bundle which has long 
   expiration and has been served frequently.

   PRoPHET draft-09 describes P_ewma, a smoother value of the 
   predictability. This document approximates ET, the expected delivery 
   time from P_ewma with the following equation. ET is the average 
   contact interval. 

   ET = log_gamma ( P_ewma / P_encounter_first ) 

   As PRoPHET draft-09, A and B are the nodes that encounter each other, 
   and the strategies are described as they would be applied by node A. 
   The destination node is D. P_(X,Y) denotes the delivery 
   predictability stored at node X for destination Y, NF is the number 
   of times A has given the bundle to some other node, EX is the 
   remained expiration of the bundle, and ET(X,Y) is the expected 
   delivery time which is approximated by P_(X,Y). P_(X,Y) is 
   P_ewma(X,Y). 

   GEXRSort 
          Select bundles in ascending order of the value of 
          (NF + 1) / (EX / ET(B,D)). 
          Forward the bundle only if P_(B,D) > P_(A,D)  
           
          The larger predictability value causes shorter ET. Therefore, 
          this strategy gives high priority to the larger predictability 
          path. This strategy gives high priority to the bundle which 
          has short expiration and gives low priority to the bundle 
          which has been forwarded more times. 
    

   GEXRSort+ 
          Select bundles in ascending order of the value of 
          (NF + 1) / (EX / ET(B,D)). 
          Forward the bundle if P_(B,D) > P_(A,D) or EX/ET(A,D)<1 
    
          This strategy is like GEXRSort, but if the expiration is very 
   short, forward the bundle to the other.
