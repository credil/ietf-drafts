Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements         April 2008


1.  Problem Statement

   Low-power wireless personal area networks (LoWPANs) are formed by
   devices complying to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard [7][8].  LoWPAN
   devices are distinguished by their low bandwidth, short range, scarce
   memory capacity, limited processing capability and other attributes
   of inexpensive hardware.  In this document, the characteristics of
   nodes participating in LoWPANs are assumed to be those described in
   [5].

   IEEE 802.15.4 networks support star and mesh topologies and consist
   of two different device types: reduced-function devices (RFDs) and
   full-function devices (FFDs).  RFDs have the most limited
   capabilities and are intended to perform only simple and basic tasks.
   RFDs may only associate with a single FFD at a time, but FFDs may
   form arbitrary topologies and accomplish more advanced functions,
   such as multi-hop routing.

   However, neither the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the 6LoWPAN format
   specification ("IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4" [6]) specify how mesh
   topologies could be obtained and maintained.  Routing in mesh
   networks has been the subject of much research.  Also in the IETF, a
   number of experimental protocols have been developed in the Mobile
   Ad-hoc Networks (MANET) working group, such as AODV [2], OLSR [3], or
   DYMO [11].  However, these existing routing protocols may not be
   satisfying for mesh routing in a LoWPAN domain, for the following
   reasons:

   o  6LoWPAN nodes have special types and roles, such as primary
      battery-operated RFDs, battery-operated and mains-powered FFDs,
      possibly various levels of RFDs and FFDs, mains-powered and high-
      performance gateways, data aggregators, etc. 6LoWPAN routing
      protocols should support multiple device types and roles.

   o  The more stringent requirements that apply to LoWPANs as opposed
      to higher performance or non-battery-operated networks.  LoWPAN
      nodes are characterized by small memory sizes, low processing
      power, and are running on very limited power supplied by primary
      non-rechargeable batteries.  A node's lifetime is usually defined
      by the lifetime of its battery.

   o  Handling sleeping nodes is very critical in 6LoWPANs, more than in
      traditional ad-hoc networks. 6LoWPAN nodes might stay in sleep-
      mode for most of the time.  Time synchronization is important for
      efficient forwarding of packets.

   o  A possibly simpler routing problem; 6LoWPANs might be either
      transit-networks or stub-networks.  However, we can focus on stub



Kaspar, et al.           Expires October 4, 2008                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements         April 2008


      networks first as many practical 6LoWPANs are configured with stub
      networks at this moment.  We can simplify networks by an
      assumption of no transit networks.

   o  A possibly harder routing problem; routing in 6LoWPANs requires to
      consider power-optimization, harsh environment, data-aware
      routing, etc.  These are not easy requirements to satisfy
      together.

   This creates new challenges on obtaining robust and reliable mesh
   routing within LoWPANs.

   Using the 6LoWPAN header format, there are two layers routing
   protocols can be defined at, commonly referred to as "mesh-under" and
   "route-over".  The mesh-under approach supports routing under the IP
   link and is directly based on the link-layer IEEE 802.15.4 standard,
   therefore using (64-bit or 16-bit short) MAC addresses.  On the other
   hand, the route-over approach relies on IP routing and therefore
   supports routing over possibly various types of interconnected links
   (see also Figure 1).

   Most statements in this draft apply to both the mesh-under and route-
   over cases.

   The 6LoWPAN problem statement document ("6LoWPAN Problems and Goals"
   [5]) briefly mentions four requirements on routing protocols;

      (a) low overhead on data packets

      (b) low routing overhead

      (c) minimal memory and computation requirements

      (d) support for sleeping nodes considering battery saving

   These four high-level requirements only describe the need for low
   overhead and power saving.  But, based on the fundamental features of
   LoWPAN, more detailed routing requirements are presented in this
   document, which can lead to further analysis and protocol design.

   In summary, the main problems of mesh routing in LoWPANs are:

   1.  Existing routing solutions do not operate in 6LoWPAN's adaptation
       layer (and do not support the addressing scheme defined by IEEE
       802.15.4).  If a routing protocol for 6LoWPAN is designed to run
       in the IP layer, it should be adapted to meet the 6LoWPAN-
       specific requirements.  It must be evaluated which layer is most
       suitable for 6LoWPAN routing.

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements         April 2008


   2.  The precise 6LoWPAN routing requirements must be defined.

   3.  It needs to be clarified how existing routing solutions can be
       adapted to meet the low-power requirements presented in
       Section 4.

   Considering the problems above, this draft addresses mesh routing
   requirements for 6LoWPANs for both mesh-under and route-over routing
   protocol design.

   Application-specific features affect the design of 6lowpan routing
   requirements and the corresponding solutions.  However, various
   applications can be profiled by similar technical characteristics.
   This document states the requirements to consider the general
   features of all categories of 6LoWPAN applications.  However, one
   single routing solution may not be the best one for all 6LoWPAN
   applications.

2.  Design Space

   Apart from a wide variety of routing algorithms possible for 6LoWPAN,
   the question remains as to whether routing should be performed mesh-
   under (in the adaptation layer defined by the 6lowpan format document
   [6]), or in the IP-layer using a route-over approach.  The most
   significant consequence of mesh-under routing is that routing would
   be directly based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, therefore using (64-
   bit or 16-bit shortened) MAC addresses instead of IP addresses, and a
   LoWPAN would be seen as a single IP link.  In case a route-over
   mechanism is to be applied to a LoWPAN it must also support 6LoWPAN's
   unique properties using global IPv6 addressing.

   Additionally, because of the low-performance characteristics of
   LoWPANs, a light-weight routing protocol must be produced that meets
   the design goals and requirements presented in this document.

   Figure 1 shows the place of 6LoWPAN mesh routing in the entire
   network stack;

   In order to avoid packet fragmentation and the overhead for
   reassembly, routing packets should fit into a single IEEE 802.15.4
   physical frame and application data should not be expanded to an
   extent that they no longer fit.

   If a mesh-under routing protocol is built for operation in 6LoWPAN's
   adaptation layer, routing control packets are placed after the
   6LoWPAN Dispatch.  Multiple routing protocols can be supported by the
   usage of different Dispatch bit sequences.  When a route-over
   protocol is built in the IPv6 layer, the Dispatch value can be chosen

3.  Scenario Considerations

   IP-based low-power WPAN technology is still in its early stage of
   development, but the range of conceivable usage scenarios is
   tremendous.  The numerous possible applications of sensor networks
   make it obvious that mesh topologies will be prevalent in LoWPAN
   environments and routing will be a necessity for expedient
   communication.  Research efforts in the area of sensor networking
   have put forth a large variety of multi-hop routing algorithms [9].
   Most related work focuses on optimizing routing for specific
   application scenarios, which can largely be categorized into the
   following models of communication:

   o  Flooding (in very small networks)

   o  Data-aware routing (dissemination vs. gathering)

   o  Event-driven vs. query-based routing

   o  Geographic routing

   o  Probabilistic routing

   o  Hierarchical routing

   Depending on the topology of a LoWPAN and the application(s) running
   over it, these different types of routing may be used.  However, this
   draft abstracts from application-specific communication and describes
   general routing requirements valid for any type of routing in
   LoWPANs.

   The following parameters can be used to describe specific scenarios
   in which the candidate routing protocols could be evaluated.

   a.  Network Properties:

       *  Device Number, Density and Network Diameter:
          These parameters usually affect the routing state directly
          (e.g. the number of entries in a routing table or neighbor
          list).  Especially in large and dense networks, policies must
          be applied for discarding "low-quality" and stale routing
          entries in order to prevent memory overflow.

       *  Connectivity:
          Due to external factors or programmed disconnections, a LoWPAN
          can be in several states of connectivity; anything in the
          range from "always connected" to "rarely connected".  This
          poses great challenges to the dynamic discovery of routes



Kaspar, et al.           Expires October 4, 2008                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements         April 2008


          across a LoWPAN.

       *  Dynamicity (incl. mobility):
          Location changes can be induced by unpredictable external
          factors or by controlled motion, which may in turn cause route
          changes.  Also, nodes may dynamically be introduced into a
          LoWPAN and removed from it later.  The routing state and the
          volume of control messages is heavily dependent on the number
          of moving nodes in a LoWPAN and their speed.

       *  Deployment:
          In a LoWPAN, it is possible for nodes to be scattered randomly
          or to be deployed in an organized manner.  The deployment can
          occur at once, or as an iterative process, which may also
          affect the routing state.

       *  Spatial Distribution of Nodes and Gateways:
          Network connectivity depends on node spatial distribution
          besides other factors like device number, density and
          transmission range.  For instance, nodes can be placed on a
          grid, or can be randomly placed in an area (bidimensional
          Poisson distribution), etc.  In addition, if the LoWPAN is
          connected to other networks through infrastructure nodes
          called gateways, the number and spatial distribution of
          gateways affects network congestion and available bandwidth,
          among others.

       *  Traffic Patterns, Topology and Applications:
          The design of a LoWPAN and the requirements on its application
          have a big impact on the most efficient routing type to be
          used.  For different traffic patterns (point-to-point,
          multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint) and network
          architectures, various routing mechanisms have been
          introduced, such as data-aware, event-driven, address-centric,
          and geographic routing.

       *  Quality of Service (QoS):
          For mission-critical applications, support of QoS is mandatory
          in resource-constrained LoWPANs and cannot be achieved without
          a certain degree of control message overhead.

       *  Security:
          LoWPANs may carry sensitive information and require a high
          level of security support where the availability, integrity,
          and confidentiality of data are primordial.  Secured messages
          cause overhead and affect the power consumption of LoWPAN
          routing protocols.

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements         April 2008


   b.  Node Parameters:

       *  Processing Speed and Memory Size:
          These basic parameters define the maximum size of the routing
          state.  LoWPAN nodes may have different performance
          characteristics beyond the common RFD/FFD distinction.

       *  Power Consumption and Power Source:
          The number and topology of battery- and mains-powered nodes in
          a LoWPAN affect routing protocols in their selection of
          optimal paths for network lifetime maximization.

       *  Transmission Range:
          This parameter affects routing.  For example, a high
          transmission range may cause a dense network, which in turn
          results in more direct neighbors of a node, higher
          connectivity and a larger routing state.

       *  Traffic Pattern: This parameter affects routing since high-
          loaded nodes (either because they are the source of packets to
          be transmitted or due to forwarding) may incur a greater
          contribution to delivery delays than low-loaded nodes.  This
          applies to both data packets and routing control messages
          themselves.

4.  6LoWPAN Routing Requirements

   This section defines a list of requirements for 6LoWPAN routing.  The
   most important design property unique to low-power networks is that
   6LoWPANs support multiple device types and roles, for example:

   o  primary battery-operated RFDs

   o  battery-operated and mains-powered FFDs

   o  possibly various levels of RFDs and FFDs

   o  mains-powered, high-performance gateway(s)

   o  data aggregators, etc.

   Due to these unique device types and roles 6LoWPANs need to consider
   the following two primary features:

   o  Power conservation: some devices are mains-powered, but most are
      battery-operated and need to last several months to a few years
      with a single AA battery.  Many devices are mains-powered most of
      the time, but still need to function for possible extended periods
      from batteries (e.g. on a construction site before building power
      is switched on for the first time).

   o  Low performance: tiny devices, small memory sizes, low-performance
      processors, low bandwidth, high loss rates, etc.

   These fundamental features of LoWPANs affect the design of routing
   solutions, so that existing routing specifications should be
   simplified and modified to the smallest extent possible, in order to
   fit the low-power requirements of LoWPANs, meeting the following
   requirements:

4.1.  Routing Requirements depending on the 6LoWPAN Device Properties

   The general objectives listed in this subsection should be followed
   by 6LoWPAN routing protocols.  The importance of each requirement is
   dependent on what device type the protocol is running on and what the
   role of the device is.

   [R01] A LoWPAN routing protocol SHOULD be designed to minimize the
   required computational and algorithmical complexity.

      The lifetime of a wireless sensor node depends on the energy it
      can store and harvest.  However, one major factor of power
      consumption in LoWPAN nodes is caused by the microcontroller.



Kaspar, et al.           Expires October 4, 2008               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements         April 2008


      Power consumption of microcontrollers varies from family to
      family, but typical low power sensor nodes have 8 or 16 bit
      microcontrollers.  They consume between 0.250 mA and 2.5 mA per
      MHz [13].  Low power microcontrollers can have a significant
      impact on system performance.  A routing protocol of low
      complexity helps to achieve the goal of reducing power
      consumption, improves robustness, requires lower routing state, is
      more easy to analyze, and is implicitly less prone to security
      attacks. 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be simple and of low
      computational complexity.

   [R02] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD have a low routing state to
   fit the typical 6LoWPAN node capacity.

      Typical RAM size of LoWPAN nodes ranges between 2KB and 10KB, and
      program flash memory normally consists of 48KB to 128KB. (e.g., in
      the current market, MICAz has 128KB program flash, 4KB EEPROM,
      512KB external flash ROM; TIP700CM has 48KB program flash, 10KB
      RAM, 1MB external flash ROM).  Operation with low routing state
      (such as routing tables and neighbor lists) SHOULD be maintained.
      For example, devices may have only 32 forwarding entries
      available.  A LoWPAN routing protocol solution should consider the
      limited memory size typically starting at 4KB, in which it is hard
      to store neighbor state of hundreds of nodes) and computation
      capabilities of participating devices; due to these hardware
      restrictions, code length should be considered to fit within a
      small memory size.  In addition, it should be taken into account
      that, while power consumption for RAM is almost negligible, flash
      writing/reading is energy expensive.  For instance, in MICA motes,
      writing and reading consumes 1.1 nAh/byte and 83.3 nAh/byte,
      respectively.

   [R03] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD cause minimal power
   consumption, both in the efficient use of control packet and also in
   the process of packet forwarding after route establishment.

      Saving energy is crucially important to LoWPAN devices that are
      not mains-powered.  In fact, power consumption of transmission
      and/or reception depends linearly on the length of data units and
      on the frequency of transmission and reception of the data units
      [15].

      Compared to functions such as computational operations or taking
      sensor samples, radio communications is by far the dominant factor
      of power consumption [12].  In [13] the energy consumption of two
      example RF controllers for low-power nodes is shown.  The TR1000
      radio consumes 21mW of energy when transmitting at 0.75mW.  During
      reception, the TR1000 consumes 15mW and has a receiver sensitivity

      of -85dBm.  The CC1000 consumes 50mW to transmit at 3mW and
      consumes 20mW to have a receiver sensitivity of -105dBm.  When
      transmitting 0.75mW, CC1000 consumes 31.6mW.  On an idealized
      power source, the CC1000 can transmit for approximately 4 days
      straight or remain in receive mode for 9 days straight.  In order
      to last for one year, the CC1000 must operate at a duty cycle of
      approximately 2%.  It is shown that a node must consume less than
      200uA on average to last for one year on a pair of AA batteries.

      Routing protocol design for 6LoWPAN should consider IEEE 802.15.4
      link layer feedback on energy consumption.  Power-aware routing is
      a non-trivial task, because it is affected by many mutually
      conflicting goals:

      *  Minimization of total energy consumed in the network

      *  Maximization of the time until a network partition occurs

      *  Minimizing the energy variance at each node

      *  Minimizing the cost per packet

      while keeping packet delivery ratio, latency or other requirements
      depending on each application.

      One way of battery lifetime optimization is by achieving a minimal
      control message overhead.

   [R04] The procedure of route repair and related control messages
   should not harm overall energy consumption from the routing
   protocols.

      Local repair improves throughput and end-to-end latency,
      especially in large networks.  Since routes are repaired quickly,
      fewer data packets are dropped, and a smaller number of routing
      protocol packet transmissions is needed since routes can be
      repaired without source initiated Route Discovery [14].

   [R05] Neighbor discovery for 6LoWPAN routing SHOULD be energy-
   efficient.

      Neighbor discovery is a major precondition to allow routing in a
      network.  Especially in a low-power environment, where nodes might
      be in periodic sleeping states, it is difficult to define whether
      a node is a neighbor of another or not.  Mesh-under neighbor
      discovery for 6LoWPANs is currently still in progress and
      described more detailed in [10].  In case of a route-over
      protocol, IPv6 neighbor discovery should be operated energy-

      efficiently.  For example, multicast may be needed if IPv6 ND
      cannot be optimized well to suit for 6LoWPAN device.

   [R06] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be reliable despite
   unresponsive nodes due to periodic hibernation.

      Many nodes in LoWPAN environments might periodically hibernate
      (i.e. disable their transceiver activity) in order to save energy.
      Therefore, mesh routing protocols must ensure robust packet
      delivery despite nodes frequently shutting off their radio
      transmission interface.  Feedback, for instance from periodic
      beacons, from the lower IEEE 802.15.4 layer may be considered to
      enhance the power-awareness of 6LoWPAN routing protocols.

4.2.  Routing Requirements depending on Types of 6LoWPAN Applications

   The routing requirements described in this subsection are heavily
   dependent on application needs.

   [R07] 6LoWPAN routing protocol SHOULD support various traffic
   patterns; point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to-
   point.

      6LoWPANs often have point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-point
      traffic patterns.  Many emerging applications include point-to-
      point communication as well. 6LoWPAN routing protocols should be
      designed with the consideration of forwarding packets from/to
      multiple sources/destinations.  Current personal drafts in the
      ROLL working group explain that the workload or traffic pattern of
      use cases for 6LoWPANs tend to be highly structured, unlike the
      any-to-any data transfers that dominate typical client and server
      workloads.  In many cases, exploiting such structure may simplify
      difficult problems arising from resource constraints or variation
      in connectivity.

   [R08] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be robust to dynamic loss
   caused by link failure or device unavailability either in short-term
   (e.g. due to RSSI variation, interference variation, noise and
   asynchrony) or in long-term (e.g. due to a depleted power source,
   hardware breakdown, operating system misbehavior, etc).

      An important trait of LoWPAN devices is their unreliability due to
      limited system capabilities, and also because they might be
      closely coupled to the physical world with all its unpredictable
      variation.  For instance, in case of structural health monitoring,
      hundreds of nodes could be placed on 20 bridge pillars spanning
      over a river.  Once the nodes are distributed, they are hardly
      accessible for maintenance and in case of single node failure, the

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements         April 2008


      network should not break down.  In harsh environments, LoWPANs
      easily suffer from link failure.  Collision or link failure easily
      increases Send Queue/Receive Queue (SQ/RQ) and it can lead to
      queue overflow and packet losses.

      The design of mesh routing protocols must consider the fact that
      packets are to be delivered with reasonable probability despite
      unreliable and unresponsive nodes.

   [R09] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD allow for dynamically adaptive
   topologies and mobile nodes.  When supporting dynamic topologies and
   mobile nodes, route maintenance should be managed by keeping in mind
   the goal of a minimal routing state.

      There are several challenges that should be addressed by a 6LoWPAN
      routing protocol in order to create robust routing in dynamic
      environments:

      *  Mobile nodes changing their location inside a LoWPAN:
         If the nodes' movement pattern is unknown, mobility cannot
         easily be detected or distinguished from routing in 6LoWPAN's
         adaptation layer.  Mobile nodes can be treated as nodes that
         disappear and re-appear in another place.  Movement pattern
         tracking increases complexity and can be avoided by handling
         moving nodes using reactive route updates.

      *  Movement of a LoWPAN with respect to other (inter)connected
         LoWPANs:
         Within stub networks, more powerful gateway nodes need to be
         configured to handle moving 6LoWPANs.

      *  Nodes permanently joining or leaving the LoWPAN:
         In order to ease routing table updates and reduce error control
         messages, it would be helpful if nodes leaving the network
         inform their coordinator about their intention to disassociate.

   [R10] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be designed to achieve both
   scalability and minimality in terms of used system resources.

      A LoWPAN may consist of just a couple of nodes (for instance in a
      body-area network), but may expand to much higher numbers of
      devices (e.g. monitoring of a city infrastructure or a highway).
      It is therefore necessary that routing mechanisms are designed to
      be scalable for operation in various network sizes.  However, due
      to a lack of memory size and computational power, 6LoWPAN routing
      might limit forwarding entries to a small number, such as 32
      routing table entries.

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements         April 2008


   [R11] 6LoWPAN protocols SHOULD support secure delivery of control
   messages.  A minimal security level can be achieved by utilizing an
   AES-based mechanism.

      Security threats within LoWPANs may be different from existing
      threat models in ad-hoc network environments.  Neighbor Discovery
      in IEEE 802.15.4 links may be susceptible to threats as listed in
      RFC3756 [4].  Bootstrapping may also impose additional threats.
      Security is also very important for designing robust routing
      protocols, but it should not cause significant transmission
      overhead.  While there are applications which require very high
      security, such as in traffic control, other applications are less
      easily harmed by wrong node behavior, such as a home entertainment
      system.

      The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC provides an AES-based security mechanism.
      Routing protocols need to define how this mechanism can be used to
      obtain the intended security.  Byte overhead of the mechanism,
      which depends on the security services selected, must be
      considered.  In the worst case in terms of overhead, the mechanism
      consumes 21 bytes of MAC payload.

4.3.  MAC-coupled Requirements

   The routing requirements described in this subsection allow
   optimization and correct operation of routing solutions taking into
   account the specific features of IEEE 802.15.4 physical and MAC
   layers.

   [R12] 6LoWPAN routing protocol control messages SHOULD not create
   fragmentation of physical layer (PHY) frames.

      In order to save energy, routing overhead should be minimized to
      prevent fragmentation of frames on the physical layer (PHY).
      Therefore, 6LoWPAN routing should not cause packets to exceed the
      IEEE 802.15.4 frame size.  This reduces the energy required for
      transmission, avoids unnecessary waste of bandwidth, and prevents
      the need for packet reassembly.  As calculated in RFC4944 [6], the
      maximum size of a 6LoWPAN frame, in order not to cause
      fragmentation on the PHY layer, is 81 octets.

   [R13] For neighbor discovery, 6LoWPAN devices SHOULD avoid sending
   "Hello" messages.  Instead, link-layer mechanisms (such as
   acknowledgments or beacon responses) MAY be utilized to keep track of
   active neighbors.

      After an IEEE 802.15.4 PAN coordinator permits a device to join,
      the new device adds the PAN coordinator to its neighbor list and

      starts transmitting periodic beacons.  These beacons can be used
      as an indication of current neighbors.

   [R14] In order to optimize the delivery ratio by using energy-optimal
   routing paths, LoWPAN mesh routing protocols should minimize power
   consumption by utilizing a combination of the metrics provided by the
   MAC layer and other measures.

      Simple hop-count-only mechanisms may be inefficient in LoWPANs.
      There is an LQI, Link Delivery Ratio (LDR), or/and RSSI from IEEE
      802.15.4 that may be taken into account for better metrics.  The
      metric to be used (and its goal) may depend on application and
      requirements.

      The numbers in Figure 2 represent the Link Delivery Ratio (LDR)
      between a pair of nodes.  There are studies that show a linear
      dependence between LQI and LDR [16].

      In this simple example, there are two options in routing from node
      A to node C:

      A.  Path AC:

          +  (1/0.6) = 1.67 avg. transmissions needed for each packet

          +  one-hop path

          +  good in energy consumption, bad in delivery ratio (0.6)

      B.  Path ABC

          +  2*(1/0.81) = 2.47 avg. transmissions needed for each packet

          +  two-hop path

          +  bad in energy consumption, good in delivery ratio (0.81)

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements         April 2008


      If energy consumption of the network must be minimized, path AC is
      the best (this path would be chosen by hop count metric).
      However, if delivery ratio in that case is not sufficient, best
      path is ABC (it would be chosen by an LQI based metric).
      Combinations of both of metrics can be used.

   [R15] In case a routing protocol operates in 6LoWPAN's adaptation
   layer, then routing tables and neighbor lists MUST support 16-bit
   short and 64-bit extended addresses.
