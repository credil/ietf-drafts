Abstract 

   Several types of Carrier Grade NATs have been proposed to simplify 
   IPv4/IPv6 transition of the edge network by integrating tunnels and 
   NAT. A very common scenario is that many users set up softwires to a 
   softwire concentrator for public or private access services. In order 
   to establish softwires successfully, a new mechanism is required to 
   enable users in the edge network to discover the information of the 
   concentrator. This document describes how a host or Customer Premises 
   Equipment discovers the remote softwire concentrator or CGN in a hub 
   and spoke network using DHCP. Based on two new Softwire Concentrator 
   Discovery DHCP Options, proposed in the document, a user can obtain 
   the information of the softwire concentrator or CGN and then set up a 
   tunnel to it.

1. Introduction 

   Transition is an important factor for user experience in IPv4 and 
   IPv6 coexistence phase. The transition of the edge network is the 
   most complicated because it is near lots of users and uses multiple 
   network technologies. Recently, several types of Carrier-Grade-NATs 
   (CGNs) have been proposed to simplify IPv4/IPv6 transition of the 
   edge network by integrating tunnels and NAT. Incremental CGN 
   [Incremental CGN] describes how dispersed IPv6 users bridge with the 
   IPv6 Internet by tunnel spanning ipv4 infrastructure. The dual-stack 
   lite technology [Ds-lite CGN] is intended for maintaining 
   connectivity to legacy IPv4 devices and networks using IPv4-over-IPv6 
   softwires while a service provider deploys an IPv6-only network. A 
   very common scenario is that many users set up softwires or tunnels 
   to a softwire concentrator for public or private access services.  

   In order to establish a softwire successfully, users must know the 
   information of a softwire concentrator or CGN, such as address, 
   tunnel type, protocol type in tunnel. Additionally, the discovery 
   process may also support load-sharing and recovery from a single 
   point of failure. 

   The aforementioned scenarios have been abstracted as hub and spoke 
   networks in the IETF Softwire working group, and several 
   encapsulation techniques have been defined [RFC4925] [RFC5512] 
   [RFC5571] discloses a mechanism in mesh network by BGP extension for 
   users to discover the information of a tunnel end point. However, the 
   nodes in an edge network do not have BGP capability generally. Manual 
   configuration is not suitable because the address and other attribute 
   of the concentrator may change. A new mechanism is required to enable 
   users in edge network to discover the information of the concentrator 
   automatically. 

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP [RFC2131], [RFC3315]) 
   is widely used in edge networks to enable auto-configuration. This 
   document extends DHCP to support discovery of a softwire concentrator 
   or CGN. This mechanism is general for incremental CGN, DS-Lite and 
   Port-range Router [Port-range, PR-v6]. It can also be extended to 
   support the discovery of other concentrators with tunnels. 

   In the absence of DHCP, PPP or Router Advertisements could be used to 
   find a softwire concentrator or CGN automatically, but this document 
   does not discuss these methods in detail.

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. DHCP Solution for Softwire Concentrator Discovery 

   In order to support softwire concentrator or CGN discovery, two new 
   DHCP options are defined respectively for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6. They 
   have the identical structure apart from address length.  

   When a DHCP server answers a client request message, softwire 
   concentrator information can be carried in a DHCP reply message. Thus 
   a client is configured the address and other attributes of a softwire 
   concentrator or CGN and can automatically set up a tunnel.  

   DHCP server decides to attach SCD option based on policy. One choice 
   is to respond only if the client requests the SCD option; another is 
   to append it to every reply no matter the client requests the SCD 
   option or not. 

   For load sharing or single-point failure recovery purposes, a DHCP 
   reply message may carry information of more than one softwire 
   concentrators.  

   Section 2.1 defines a new DHCPv4 Softwire Concentrator Discovery (SCD) 
   option while Section 2.2 defines DHCPv6 SCD option. Section 2.3 
   defines sub-options that apply to both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 SCD option. 

3.1. DHCPv4 Softwire Concentrator Discovery (SCD) Option 

   The DHCPv4 Softwire Concentrator Discovery (SCD) Option is mainly 
   used when an IPv6 host or CPE in an IPv4 ISP network wants to obtain 
   an IPv4 address of an IPv6 access point or an incremental CGN. The 
   Option is carried in DHCPv4. 

   A DHCP message may carry more than one SCD Option.  

   The DHCPv4 SCD Option is structured as follows:

        Len: total length of the prefix and padding fields in octets. 

        Prefix Len: Length for this prefix in bits. 

        IPv6 Prefix: IPv6 prefix allocated to the client to construct 
        internal address of the tunnel. 

        Padding: additional 0~7 bits MUST be padded at the end of IPv6 
        Prefix field when the value in Prefix Len field is not a 
        multiple of 8-bit. The padding bits SHOULD be set as 0. 

   The semantics of the value field is determined by the tunnel type. 
   For example, a client can obtain IPv6 Prefix of ISATAP tunnel by this 
   suboption in DHCP SDC Option. 

3.3.3. GRE Key Suboption 

   When the tunnel type is GRE, this suboption may be contained.

        without the correspondent GRE key or with an unmatched GRE Key 
        will be silently dropped. 

4. Illustration Examples 

4.1. Example 1: Incremental CGN scenario 

   As an example, an incremental CGN with IP address 192.0.2.1 and 
   L2TPv2 tunnel support is deployed in an IPv4 ISP network. The CGN 
   information is stored in a DHCPv4 server. When a dual stack user in 
   the network wants to connect IPv6 Internet, it will send a DHCPv4 
   request message to the DHCP server to obtain the CGN information. The 
   DHCP server replies with a SCD option. The parameters in the SCD 
   option are "CGN address = 192.0.2.1, tunnel type = 1, preference = 
   80". After the user receives the option, it can set up an L2TPv2 
   tunnel with the CGN. 

4.2. Example 2: two CGN in DS lite scenario 

   In another example scenario, there are two DS lite CGNs deployed in 
   order to provide redundancy and load balancing. DS lite CGN1 is 
   2001:db8:a::1, the other CGN2 is 2001:db8:b::1. Both of them support 
   IPv4 in IPv6 tunnel. The preference of each CGN is decided by the 
   network management policy. A user may get two SCD options, one 
   describes CGN1 "CGN address = 2001:db8:a::1, tunnel type = 3, 
   preference = 80" and the other describes CGN2 "CGN address = 
   2001:db8:b::1, tunnel type = 3, preference = 255". The user should 
   establish an IPv4 in IPv6 tunnel with the CGN1, which has higher 
   preference. When the CGN1 is down, the user may re-establish tunnel 
   to the CGN2. 

   For the load balancing purpose, another user may receive the options, 
   in which CGN2 has the higher preference value. The user may set CGN2 
   as its primary CGN. 

5. Security Considerations 

   There are two forms of attack using bogus SCD options should be 
   noticeable: 

       1. A wiretap attack, in which a bogus concentrator observes the 
       traffic before pretending to be the real client and sending the 
       traffic to the real concentrator. 

       2. A DoS attack, in which a bogus concentrator is used in some 
       way to create a loop or simply to act as a source of DoS packets.

   The mechanisms based on DHCPv6 are all vulnerable by man-in-middle 
   attacks. Proper use of DHCPv6 auto-configuration facilities [RFC3315], 
   such as AUTH option or Secure DHCP [SDHCP] can prevent these threats, 
   provided that a configuration token is known to both the client and 
   the server. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to allocate one DHCPv4 SCD Option code TBD1 and one 
   DHCPv6 Option code TBD2. 

   This document defines two new namespaces: 

      - Tunnel Types 
      - SCD Suboption Types 

6.1. Tunnel Types 

   Section 2.1 & 2.2 defines the following Tunnel Types, which should 
   assigned by IANA for use within DHCPv4 & DHCPv6 SCD Option. IANA set 
   up a registry for "Tunnel Types for DHCP SCD Option". This is a 
   registry of one-octet values (0-255), to be assigned on a first-come, 
   first-served basis. The initial assignments are as follows: 

      Tunnel Name                             Type 
      ---------------                         ----- 
      Reserved                                  0 
      L2TPv2                                    1 
      GRE                                       2 
      IP-in-IP                                  3 
      ISATAP                                    4 
      6to4                                      5 
      6rd                                       6 
      IPsec                                     7 

6.2. SCD Suboption Types 

   Section 2.3 defines the following SCD Suboption Types, which should 
   assigned by IANA for use within DHCPv4 & DHCPv6 SCD Option. IANA set 
   up a registry for "SCD Suboption Types for DHCP SCD Option". This is 
   a registry of one-octet values (0-255), to be assigned on a first-
   come, first-served basis. The initial assignments are as follows: 

      Tunnel Name                             Type 
      ---------------                         ----- 
      Protocol Type                             0
