Internet-Draft         SIP Interconnect Guidelines          October 2009


Abstract

   As Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) peering becomes more widely
   accepted by service providers the need to define an interconnect
   guideline becomes of greater value.  This document takes into
   consideration the SIP and commonly used SIP extensions, and it
   defines a fundamental set of requirements for SIP Service Providers
   (SSPs) to implement within their signaling functions (SFs) or
   Signaling Path Border Elements (SBEs) for peering.

Internet-Draft         SIP Interconnect Guidelines          October 2009


1.  Introduction

   In the SIP Service Provider (SSP) industry every SSP has their own
   SIP requirements.  Whether they defined it themselves or a vendor's
   equipment capabilities defined it for them, they have one.  When two
   SSPs approach one another to establish a peering relationship, one of
   the first pieces of information they exchange is their respective SIP
   requirements or profiles.  (For the purposes of this draft, we will
   call it a SIP profile.)  After exchanging SIP profiles, each SSP will
   likely go back to their lab and spend an extended period of time
   attempting to comply with the other SSP's SIP profile, either by
   requesting their vendor to implement or change capabilities, by
   developing "interworking profiles" for manipulating SIP messages at
   their SF or SBE, or by arguing defiantly that their approach is
   correct.  While this may seem like a simple and manageable task when
   establishing a single peering relationsip, it can become extremely
   burdensome as the number of peering relationships increase to four,
   five, and beyond.

   The overwhelming sentiment is that there is a need to establish a
   minimum set of requirements an SSP can implement within their SF or
   SBE to peer with any other SSP.  While this may seem like an arduous
   task, there is a belief that a fundamental set of requirements could
   be established as a baseline guideline to establish peering with any
   SSP.  After the peering is established, the two SSPs may agree on
   additional SIP parameters or extensions that expand the capabilities
   for many different purposes.  Over time, this document may be
   extended or updated as necessary to maintain consistency with the
   widely adopted new use of SIP functionality in the industry.

   This document provides an interconnect guideline to address potential
   SIP interworking issues for peering SIP-based networks.

1.1.  Scope

   This document describes the SIP interconnect procedures between two
   SIP-based networks for both peering SIP Service Providers networks
   and peering Enterprise networks.

   The document focuses on the interworking procedures required to
   support basic telephone service, including the following
   capabilities:

   o  On-net to on-net calls

   o  Multi-media

3.  Reference Architecture

   Figure 1 shows the peering relationship between two SSPs; SSP-A and
   SSP-B.  The Signaling Path Border Element (SBE) serves as the egress/
   ingress point for SIP signaling into each peers network.  The SBE may
   act as a proxy or a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA).  The optional
   Data Path Border Element (DBE) serves as a media relay at the peering
   interface for media interworking, topology hiding and IPv4/6
   interworking.

                      Figure 1: Peering Architecture

   This document places requirements on the following two entities in
   the Peering architecture:

   o  the SBE in support of the SIP/SDP interface between two peering
      networks

   o  the DBE in support of the RTP/RTCP interface between peering
      networks

   Based on the definition of the SBE in the peering architecure
   document [I-D.ietf-speermint-architecture], it's not entirely correct
   to make the SBE responsible for meeting all the SIP signaling
   requirements at the peering interface.  For example, the SBE can play
   the role of a firewall or a SIP proxy that is largely transparent to
   the SIP messages crossing the interface.  In reality, the
   responsiblity for supporting this interface belongs to all the SIP
   entities in the SIP signaling chain, including the SBE plus the SIP
   proxies and UAs inside the network.  Furthermore, when this network
   is serving as a transit network, the SIP signaling chain can extend
   into another network.  To resolve this issue, this document extends
   the definition of the SBE slightly so that when it is specified as
   the target entity of a normative requirement on the SIP/SDP peering
   interface, the SBE represents all the SIP entities in the SIP
   signaling chain that can effect the SIP/SDP peering interface.

   Likewise, the DBE can act as a media relay (performing no media
   encode/decode) that is transparent to the RTP/RTCP packets exchanged
   with the peer network.  Therefore, this document extends the
   definition of the DBE so that when it is specified as the target
   entity of a normative requirement on the RTP/RTCP interface, it
   represents the media endpoint in the peering network that terminates
   the RTP/RTCP stream.

4.  General Procedures

4.1.  Extension Negotiation

   It is RECOMMENDED that originating SBEs facing other peer networks be
   configured in such a way that they do not require any SIP extensions
   to be supported by the other end.  The SBE MUST identify all
   supported SIP extensions in the Supported header.  The SBE MAY
   support configuration controls to disable certain extensions based on
   bilateral agreement between peer networks.  For example, the SBE
   could be configured to remove '100rel' from the Supported header in
   order to disable the use of reliable provisionable response (PRACK).

   When sending a dialog-initialing request to a peer network, the SBE
   MUST identify all supported SIP requests in the Allow header field.

4.2.  Public User Identities

   Users are identified at the peering interface by their Public User
   Identity.  An SBE MUST encode Public User Identities as a SIP URI of
   the telephone-subscriber syntax form of a Tel URI as indicated by the
   "user=phone" parameter (see Section 19.1.6 of [RFC3261]), where the
   user part of the SIP URI contains a global Tel URI as defined in
   [RFC3966].

   Example:

   sip:+13035551212@examplessp.com;user=phone

4.2.1.  Identifying the Called User

   When sending a dialog-initiating request to a peer network, the SBE
   MUST :

   o  identify the called user in the Request-URI of the request, using
      the telephone-subscriber syntax form of the SIP URI as described
      above in section 4.2; and

   o  if Local Number Portability (LNP) information for the called
      number was obtained, then

      *  include the LNP data in SIP URI in the Request-URI using the
         Tel URI "npdi" and "rn" parameters as defined in [RFC4694], and

      *  if the called number is ported, then identify the routing
         number using the global form of the "rn" parameter, which is
         indicated by a leading "+" character followed by the country-
         code followed by the national number (e.g., "rn=+16132220000").

Internet-Draft         SIP Interconnect Guidelines          October 2009


   On receiving a dialog-initiating request from a peer network, the SBE
   MUST:

   o  identify the called user based on the contents in the Request-URI,
      where the Request URI contains a SIP URI as described above in
      section 4.2, and

   o  obtain the LNP data for the called number based on the presence
      and contents of the "npdi" and "rn" parameters contained in the
      SIP URI of the Request-URI as defined in [RFC4694].

4.2.2.  Identifying the Calling User

   When sending or receiving a dialog-initiating request, the SBE MUST:

   o  identify the calling user in the P-Asserted-Identity header using
      the telephone-subscriber syntax form of the SIP URI as described
      above in section 4.2; and

   o  if calling name display is supported, then include the calling
      name display information in the P-Asserted-Identity header as
      described in section 5.2.

4.3.  Trust Domain and Asserted Identities

   In a peering relationship, both originating and terminating networks
   are in the same trust domain.  Therefore, per [RFC3325], the
   terminating network MUST trust an originating peer network to
   populate the P-Asserted-Identity header in an incoming INVITE request
   with the Public User Identity of the originating user.  Furthermore,
   the originating network MUST trust the terminating network to honor
   the privacy wishes of the originator as indicated in the Privacy
   header.

4.4.  IPv4/6 Interworking

   It is the responsibility of the IPv6 network to perform the IPv4/IPv6
   interworking function when interworking with an IPv4 network.

4.5.  Fault Isolation and Recovery

4.5.1.  Interface Failure Detection

   An SBE MAY periodically send an OPTIONS request with Max-forwards set
   to '0' to detect the availability of a peer's ingress point.  The
   ping rate is based on bi-lateral agreement (typically every 5
   seconds).  If the sending SBE fails to receive a response to an
   OPTIONS request, then it will consider that non-responding ingress

Internet-Draft         SIP Interconnect Guidelines          October 2009


   point into the peer network to have failed, and will refrain from
   routing new requests to it.  In the meantime, it will continue to
   send periodic OPTIONS pings to the failed ingress point in order to
   detect when it has been restored and is available for service.

   Note: A possible enhancement to the OPTIONS ping is to declare a
   well-known SIP URI in the look-up function (LUF) that could be used
   to test the health of each ingress SF or SBE in a peer network.  For
   example, SIP INVITE (with no SDP) to sip:999999999@examplessp.com
   would respond with a 200 OK (again no SDP), followed by a BYE/200 OK.

4.5.2.  Overload Control

   SIP does not currently provide an explicit overload control
   mechanism.  However, an SSP may want to impose limits on the number
   of simultaneous calls, and the incoming call rate it will accept from
   a peer SSP.  On receiving a dialog-initiating request that exceeds
   such limits, the receiving SBE MUST respond with a 503 (Service
   Unavailable) response.  An SBE receiving a dialog-initiating request
   from a peer MUST limit the use of the 503 (Service Unavailable)
   response to reporting overload at the ingress signaling point, and
   MUST NOT use this response to report overload or other failures
   internal to the network.

   On receiving a 503 (Service Unavailable) response from a peer
   network, the receiving SBE MUST limit the scope of the response to
   the call on which it was received (i.e., a 503 response has no affect
   on the routing of subsequent calls to the peer).  Also, the receiving
   SBE MUST attempt to consume the 503 (Service Unavailable) response
   from a peer as close to the egress signaling point as possible, and
   avoid propagating the response back toward the source of the request.
   Specifically, on receiving a 503 (Service Unavailable) response to a
   dialog-initiating request that was sent to a peer network, the SBE
   MUST:

   o  terminate the current transaction,

   o  ignore the Retry-After header if one is present, and

   o  attempt to route the call via an alternate peering interface (i.e.
      do not attempt to route the call via the same peering interface
      since it may encouter and aggravate the same overload condition).

4.5.3.  Session Timer

   The SBE SHOULD support Session Timer as defined in [RFC4028].

5.  Call Features

5.1.  Session Establishment

5.1.1.  SDP Requirements

   The SBE MUST support the SDP requirements defined in [RFC4566].  The
   SBE MUST include only one media (m=) descriptor per desired media
   stream in an SDP offer to a peer network.

   If an SBE receives an SDP offer containing multiple media
   descriptors, it MUST act on the media descriptors and include all of
   them in the same order in the response, including non-zero ports and
   zero ports for the offered media according to its capabilities as
   specified in [RFC3264] An Offer/Answer Model with SDP.  The SBE MUST
   NOT reject an offered session because it offers more media than the
   SBE can handle.

5.1.2.  Basic Call Setup

   This section describes the procedures at the peering interface
   required to establish a 2-way session for a basic voice call between
   two users.  In this case it is assumed that no originating or
   terminating features are applied (no call blocking, forwarding,
   etc.), and that the called line is available to accept the call.
   Also, this section describes the session establishment procedures
   when tha call is initiated by the originating SIP User Agent itself,
   and not via a 3rd party in support of features like click-to-call.
   Two-way call establishment using 3PCC is covered in section
   Section 5.1.5.

   The SBE MUST support the SDP offer/answer procedures specified in
   [RFC3264].  The originating SBE MUST include an SDP offer in the
   initial INVITE.  The terminating SBE MUST include an SDP answer in
   the first reliable response to INVITE (typically the final 200 (OK)
   response to the INVITE).  The terminating SBE MAY also include an SDP
   body in a non-reliable provisional 18x response to the INVITE.  The
   SDP contained in a non-reliable 18x provisional response can be
   considered a "preview" of the actual SDP answer to be sent in the 200
   (OK) to INVITE.  The originating SBE can act on this "preview" SDP to
   establish an early media session, as described in section
   Section 5.1.3.  The terminating SBE MUST ensure that the "preview"
   SDP matches the actual SDP answer contained in the 200 (OK) response
   to INVITE.

   Note: an SDP offer/answer exchange occurs within the context of a
   single dialog.  Therefore, the requirement for matching SDPs in the
   provisional and final responses to INVITE applies only when the



Hancock & Malas          Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft         SIP Interconnect Guidelines          October 2009


   provisional and final response are in the same dialog.  If the
   provisional and final response are on different dialogs (say, when
   the INVITE is forked), the requirement for matching SDPs does not
   apply.

   The SBE MUST always set the SDP mode attribute in the initial offer/
   answer to "a=sendrecv".

   Note: Setting the mode to "a=sendrecv" on the initial SDP offer/
   answer exchange avoids an additional SDP offer/answer exchange to
   update the mode to send-receive after the call is answered.  This
   should help mitigate the problem of voice-clipping on answer.

   A peered originating and terminating SBE that advertise support for
   different but overlapping sets of codecs in the SDP offer/answer
   exchange for a given call MUST negotiate a common codec for the call.

5.1.3.  Ringback Tone vs. Early Media

   During the call setup phase, while the originating network is waiting
   for the terminating network to answer the call, the originating line
   is either playing local ringback tone to the calling user or
   connected to a receive-only or bi-directional early-media session
   with the terminating network.  For example, early media can be
   supplied by the terminating endpoint (e.g., custom ringback tone)
   while waiting for answer.

   During session establishment, an SBE MUST use the following
   procedures to control whether the originating line applies local
   ringback tone or establishes an early media session while waiting for
   the call to be answered:

   o  The terminaing SBE MUST send the following provisional response to
      a call-initiating INVITE:

      *  a 180 (Alerting) response containing no SDP if the call
         scenario requires the originating network to apply local
         ringback tone,

      *  a 183 (Progressing) response containing SDP that describes the
         terminating media endpoint if the call scenario requires the
         originating network to establish an early-media session with
         the terminating media endpoint,

      *  the provisional response sent for other call scenarios is not
         specified, as long as the response is not one of those
         specified above.




Hancock & Malas          Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         SIP Interconnect Guidelines          October 2009


   o  The originating SBE MUST perform the following action on receipt
      of a provisional response to a call-initiating INVITE:

      *  on receiving a 180 (Alerting) response containing no SDP, apply
         local ringback tone,

      *  on receiving a 180 (Alerting) or 183 (Progressing) response
         containing SDP, establish an early media session with the media
         endpoint described by the SDP,

      *  on receiving any other provisional response (with or without
         SDP) do nothing (e.g., continue to apply local ringback tone if
         it was already being applied when response was received)

5.1.4.  Early-Media with Multiple Terminating Endpoints


   There are some call scenarios that require media sessions to be
   established (serially) between the originating user agent and one or
   more intermediate media endpoints before the call is connected to the
   final target called user agent.  For example, the terminating network
   can insert a media server in the call to interact with the calling
   user in some way (e.g., to collect a blocking-override PIN) before
   offering the call to the called user.  Another case occurs when the
   called user fails to answer within an allotted time and the call is
   redirected to voice-mail, or forwarded to another user via Call
   Forwarding Don't Answer (CFDA).  These different cases can be
   combined in the same call.

   For each terminating media endpoint that is associated with a call
   before the call is answered, the terminating network must decide
   whether to establish an early media session or apply ringback tone at
   the originating user agent.  For example, consider the case where the
   called user has call blocking with PIN override, and CFDA.  First, an
   early-media session is established with the call-blocking server to
   collect the PIN, next the originating user agent is instructed to
   play local ring-back tone while waiting for the called user to
   answer, and finally an early media session is established with the
   forward-to party to play custom ringback tone.

   [RFC3261] mandates that the SDP included unreliable provisional 18x
   responses to INVITE within the context of a dialog must match the
   SDP-answer included in the final 200 (OK) response to INVITE.  The
   following sections describe two different mechanisms for supporting
   multiple terminating media endpoints before answer, within the
   confines of this requirement.

Internet-Draft         SIP Interconnect Guidelines          October 2009


5.1.4.1.  Forking the INVITE

   For each terminating media endpoint that requires an early media
   session to be established with the originating media endpoint, the
   terminating SBE MUST signal the attributes of the terminating media
   endpoint to the originating SBE within the SDP of a 183 (Progressing)
   response.  The terminating SBE MUST ensure that 18x responses
   containing different SDP copies are not sent within the same dialog.
   The terminating SBE does this by specifying a different To: tag for
   each provisional response that contains a unique SDP, as if the
   INVITE had been sequentially forked.

   The originating SBE MUST honor the most recently received 18x
   response to INVITE, based on the procedures defined in section
   5.1.2.2.

5.1.4.2.  Redirecting the INVITE

   As an alternative to sequentially forking the INVITE, the terminating
   entity can redirect the originating entity to the next endpoint in
   the series by sending a 302 (Moved Temporarily) response containing a
   Contact header field that identifies the next endpoint.  The
   resulting INVITE from the originating SBE is sent as a dialog-
   initiating request, and can therefore establish a new early-media
   session with the next endpoint in the series.  The use of this
   procedure is based on bilateral agreement between peering operators.

   On receiving a 302 (Moved Temporarily) response to an INVITE request,
   and if this mechanism is enabled based on local policy, the
   originating SBE MUST send a new dialog-initiating INVITE with a
   Request-URI set to the value returned in the Contact header field of
   the 302 (Moved Temporarily) response, as described in [RFC3261].

5.1.5.  Establishing calls using 3PCC

   Section Section 5.1.2 describes the procedures that are used to
   establish basic two-way call when the call is initiated directly by
   the originating user's endpoint.  However, an SSP may support
   features such as click-to-call, where the call is initiated by a 3rd
   party such as an Applicaion Server on bahalf of the originating user.
   To support such features, the SBE MUST support the 3PCC procedures
   described in [RFC3725].

5.1.6.  Hold

   An SBE that wishes to place a media stream "on hold" MUST offer an
   updated SDP to its peer network with an attribute of "a=inactive" or
   "a=sendonly" in the media description block.  An SBE that wishes to



Hancock & Malas          Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft         SIP Interconnect Guidelines          October 2009


   place a media stream "on hold" MUST NOT set the connection
   information of the SDP to a null IP address (for example, it MUST NOT
   set the 'c=' connection line to c=IN IP4 0.0.0.0).  An SBE that wants
   to place a media stream "on hold" SHOULD locally mute the media
   stream.

   An SBE that receives an SDP offer with an attribute of "a=inactive"
   in the media block MUST place the media stream "on hold", and MUST
   answer with an updated SDP containing a media attribute of
   "a=inactive".  An SBE that receives an SDP offer with an attribute of
   "a=inactive" in the media block MUST NOT set the connection data of
   the answer SDP to c=0.0.0.0.  An SBE operating in IPv4 that receives
   an SDP offer with no directionality attributes but connection data
   set to c=IN IP4 0.0.0.0 SHOULD place the media stream "on hold".

5.2.  Calling Name and Number Deliver (with Privacy)

   An originating SBE MUST provide the calling name and number of the
   originating user in the P-Asserted-Identity header of dialog-
   initiating requests.  (The mechanism for obtaining the calling name
   is out-of-scope of this document.)  The calling number is contained
   in the telephone-subscriber syntax form of the SIP URI, containing an
   E.164 number as described in section 4.2.  The calling name is
   contained in the display-name component of the P-Asserted-Identity
   header.

   If the originating user wants to remain anonymous, the originating
   SBE MUST include a Privacy header containing the value "id" as
   specified in [RFC3323] and [RFC3325].  In addition, the originating
   SBE SHOULD obscure the identity of the originating user in other
   headers as follows:

   o  Set the identity information in the 'From' header to "Anonymous
      sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid",

   o  Set the display-name in the To header to "Anonymous" (since the To
      display-name selected by the originating user could provide a hint
      to the originating user's identity).

   o  Obscure any information from the Call-ID and Contact headers, such
      as the originating FQDN, that could provide a hint to the
      originating user's identity.

5.3.  Call Forwarding

   If an SSP offers call-forwarding services to its users, then the
   forwarding SBE MAY remain in the signaling path of the forwarded call
   in order to support separate billing of forward-from and forward-to



Hancock & Malas          Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft         SIP Interconnect Guidelines          October 2009


   legs.  This is accomplished by

   o  remaining in the signaling path as a proxy or B2BUA, or

   o  by responding to the initial INVITE with a 302 (Moved Temporarily)
      response with a Contact header containing a private URI that
      points back to the forwarding network

   MUST support the History-Info header as defined in [RFC4244] to
   detect call-forwarding loops.

5.3.1.  Detecting Call Forwarding Loops

   A call forwarding loop is defined to be the scenario that occurs when
   a targeted subscriber for a call forwards the call to another
   destination.  If the forwarded-to destination also has call
   forwarding configured, the call can forward back (directly or
   indirectly) to the original targeted subscriber.  When a loop is
   detected, the network that performs the detection rejects the call.
   An SBE MUST detect call forwarding loops.  An SBE MUST support a
   configurable limit on the number of times an individual call may be
   subject to forwarding.  If the number of forwarding attempts for a
   single call exceeds this limit, the SBE MUST reject the call.

   An SBE SHOULD detect call forwarding loops and limit the number times
   a call is forwarded by supporting the History-Info header field as
   defined in [RFC4244], and by analysing the History-Info entries as
   described in this section.  However, these mechanisms alone may not
   be sufficient to detect loops when calls are forwarded to networks
   not supporting these mechanisms.  Therefore an SBE MAY support
   additional loop prevention and forwarding limit detection methods as
   long as the requirements of forwarding limit restriction and loop
   detection are met.

   If the SBE supports the prevention of forwarding loops via analysis
   of the History-Info header present in the INVITE then it MUST compare
   the forward-to address with the set of targeted-to URI (hi-targeted-
   to-uri) entries from the History-Info header.  If there is a match
   then a loop has occurred.  If no History-Info header is present then
   it is not possible to perform loop detection via this mechanism.

   If an SBE supports the prevention of forwarding loops by enforcing a
   maximum number of forwarding attempts, then it MUST calculate the
   number of forwarding attempts by counting the number of entries in
   the History-Info header that were added due to call forwarding (i.e.,
   entries containing a nested Reason header which includes a protocol-
   cause parameter and a reason-text parameter that indicate the call
   was forwarded as defined below).  If no History-Info header is



Hancock & Malas          Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft         SIP Interconnect Guidelines          October 2009


   present then it is not possible to determine the number of forwarding
   attempts via this mechanism.

   [RFC4458] defines the mapping between the forwarding conditions and
   the coding of the protocol-cause parameter in the Reason header.  An
   SBE MUST populate the Reason header with a protocol-cause value of
   "486" and a reason-text value of "CFBL" when the forwarding condition
   is Call Forwarding Busy Line (CFBL).  The SBE MUST populate the
   Reason header with a protocol-cause value of "408" and a reason-text
   value of "CFDA" when the forwarding condition is Call Forwarding
   Don't Answer (CFDA).  The SBE MUST populate the Reason header with a
   protocol-cause value of "302" and a reason-text value of "CFV/SCF"
   when the forwarding ondition is Caff Forwarding Valriable (CFV) or
   Selective Call Forwarding (SCF).

5.4.  Call Transfer

   A user in a peered call can perform the various forms of call-
   transfer (consultive transfer, blind transfer).  Call-transfer can be
   supported in one of two ways; either using the REFER request
   [RFC3515] and Replaces header [RFC3891], or by manipulating the call
   legs using 3rd Party Call Control (3PCC) techniques.  SBEs that
   support call transfer MUST support the 3PCC option, and MAY support
   the REFER/Replaces option.  If a network supports both options, then
   the option that is used when interworking with a specific peer is
   based on locally configured data that indicates the capabilities of
   that peer.

5.4.1.  Call-Transfer Using REFER/Replaces

   SBEs that support call-transfer using the procedures described in
   this section MUST support the SIP REFER extension described in
   [RFC3515], and the SIP Replaces extension described in [RFC3891].
   Furthermore, [RFC3515] requires support of the SIP Event Notification
   extension described in [RFC3265].

   To describe the basic transfer call-flow, consider the case where
   user-A in SSP-A is in an active call with user-B in peered sSSP-B,
   and user-A decides to transfer user-B to user-C.  User-C could be
   located anywhere in the global network; for example in SSP-A, SSP-B,
   another peered network, a non-peering IP network, or the PSTN.  Here
   are the basic steps to complete the transfer using REFER/Replaces:

   o  User-A puts user-B on hold (sends re-INVITE with SDP "a=inactive"
      as described in 5.1.1.1)

   o  User-A initiates a basic 2-way call to user-C




Hancock & Malas          Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft         SIP Interconnect Guidelines          October 2009


   o  User-A sends an in-dialog REFER to user-B containing a Refer-To
      header.  The Refer-To header instructs user-B to send an INVITE to
      user-C with an imbedded Replaces header identifying the A-to-C
      dialog.

      *  If SSP-A is not required to remain in the signaling path of the
         transferred call, then it identifies user-C directly in the
         Refer-To header,

      *  If SSP-A is required to remain in the signaling path of the
         transferred call (say to generate events for proper billing of
         the call), then it identifies a private URL pointing to itself
         in the Refer-To header.  The private URL contains a "hostport"
         that identifies SSP-A, and contains a "userinfo" string that is
         generated by SSP-A.  This "userinfo" string either contains or
         points to information required by SSP-A to establish the
         transfer-to leg of the call.

   o  User-B sends an INVITE containing the Replaces header specified in
      step-3 to the address contained in the Refer-To header (i.e., the
      INVITE is routed to user-C either directly from ssp-B, or
      indirectly via SSP-A using the private URL)

   o  User-B sends Notify requests within the original A-to-B dialog,
      informing user-A of the progress of the B-to-C call

   o  At some point user-A drops out of both dialogs (e.g., drops out of
      A-to-C dialog on receiving BYE from user-C).  At this point users
      B and C are active in a 2-way call.

   SBEs SHOULD support receiving a GRUU [I-D.ietf-sip-gruu] in the
   Refer-To header.

5.4.2.  Call-Transfer Using 3PCC

   SBEs that support call-transfer using 3PCC techniques MUST act as a
   B2BUA, and manipulate the call legs using INVITE and re-INVITE
   requests.  It is RECOMMENDED that such techniques follow the guidance
   presented in [RFC3725].

5.5.  3-way Conference

   The media mixing for 3-way conference calls may be performed by the
   user agent of the conference control party, or by a conference bridge
   application server in the peer network serving the conference control
   party.  When mixing is done by the user agent, there are no specific
   requirements placed on the peering interface other than the support
   of hold as described in section 5.1.1.1.  When conference mixing is



Hancock & Malas          Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 20]

Internet-Draft         SIP Interconnect Guidelines          October 2009


   performed by a network-based server, users are added to the
   conference using procedures similar to those described for call
   transfer in section 5.4.

5.6.  Auto Recall/Callback

   When a user invokes AC or AR, and the user targeted by the recall/
   callback feature belongs to a peer network, the originating SBE first
   attempts to establish a basic 2-way call with the target user.  If
   the call completes normally (e.g., the target user answers) then the
   feature is complete.  If the terminating SBE responds with an
   indication that the target user is busy, then the originating SBE
   subscribes to the dialog-event package as defined in [RFC4235] of the
   target user, as a mechanism to detect when the target user becomes
   available.  When the terminating SBE subsequently notifies the
   originating SBE that the target user is available, the originating
   SBE re-attempts to establish a 2-way call to the target user.

5.6.1.  Originating SBE Sends INVITE to Target

   When a user invokes an AR or AC call, the originating SBE MUST follow
   the procedures given for a basic call as described in Section 5.1.2,
   and attempt to establish a 2-way call with the target user.  In
   addition, the originating SBE MUST add a Call-Info header field to
   the INVITE with a purpose of "answer_if_not_busy".

   If the originating SBE receives a 200-OK response to INVITE, then the
   AC/AR feature is considered complete, and the remainder of the call
   is handled like a normal 2-way call.  If the originating SBE receives
   a 486-Busy-Here or 600-Busy-Everywhere response to the INVITE, then
   it MUST follow the AC/AR procedures as defined below.  If the
   terminating SBE receives an inbound INVITE with a Call-Info header
   field declaring purpose= answer_if_not_busy, then the terminating SBE
   MUST ignore any active Call-Forwarding-Busy-Line (CFBL) service for
   the target user, not forward the call if the target is busy, and
   instead handle the call as if CFBL was not active (e.g., offer the
   call using the call-waiting feature).

5.6.2.  Originating SBE Sends SUBSCRIBE to Target

   On receiving a 486-Busy-Here or 600-Busy-Everywhere response to an
   AC/AR INVITE request, the originating SBE MUST establish a
   subscription to the dialog event package of the target endpoint, by
   sending a SUBSCRIBE request containing an Event header field set to
   "dialog" to the terminating SBE.  The originating SBE MUST populate
   the SUBSCRIBE Request-URI with the URI returned in the Contact header
   field of the INVITE response, if that URI is a GRUU.  Otherwise, the
   originating SBE MUST populate the Request-URI with the identity of



Hancock & Malas          Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft         SIP Interconnect Guidelines          October 2009


   the target callback/recall user.

5.6.3.  Target Sends NOTIFY to Originating SBE

   On receiving the SUBSCRIBE to the dialog event package, the
   terminating SBE MUST notify the originating SBE of the dialog state
   of the target user endpoint as described in [RFC4235].  Upon
   receiving a NOTIFY message of "target is idle", the originating SBE
   MUST first cancel the dialog-event subscription by sending a
   SUBSCRIBE message with an Expires header containing the value "0".
   Once the subscription is cancelled, the originating SBE MUST send a
   new INVITE request to establish a call with the target user.  If the
   originating SBE receives a 486-Busy-Here or 600-Busy-Everywhere
   response to the INVITE, then it MUST automatically re-subscribe to
   the dialog event package of the target user.  (Note, a "busy"
   response could be returned in this case as a result of a race
   condition, where the target endpoint sends a NOTIFY of "target is
   idle", and then becomes busy in a new call before the subsequent
   INVITE is received).
