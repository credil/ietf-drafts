Abstract

   OSPFv3 includes a mechanism for supporting multiple instances on the
   same link.  OSPFv2 could benefit from such a mechanism in order to
   support multiple routing domains on the same subnet.  The OSPFv2
   instance ID is reserved for support of separate OSPFv2 protocol
   instances.  This is different from OSPFv3 where it could be used for
   other purposes such as putting the same link in multiple areas.
   OSPFv2 supports this capability using a separate subnet or the OSPF
   multi-area adjacency capability.

Internet-Draft       OSPF Multi-Instance Extensions       September 2011


1.  Introduction

   OSPFv3 [OSPFV3] includes a mechanism for supporting multiple
   instances on the same link.  OSPFv2 [OSPFV2] could benefit from such
   a mechanism in order to support multiple routing domains on the same
   subnet.  The OSPFv2 Interface Instance ID is reserved for support of
   separate OSPFv2 protocol instances.  This is different from OSPFv3
   where it could be used for other purposes such as putting the same
   link in multiple areas.  OSPFv2 supports this capability using a
   separate subnet or the OSPF multi-area adjacency capability
   [MULTI-AREA].

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-KEYWORDS].

2.  OSPFv2 Instance Packet Encoding

   OSPFv2 currently doesn't offer a mechanism to differentiate packets
   for different instances sent and received on the same interface.  In
   support of this capability, this document introduces a modified
   packet header format when the Authentication Type field is split into
   an Instance ID and AuType.

      the Instance ID has local subnet significance only.  Received
      packets with an Instance ID not equal to one of the configured
      OSPF Instance IDs on the receiving interface MUST be discarded.

3.  OSPF Interface Instance ID

   OSPF [OSPFV2] describes the conceptual interface data structure in
   section 9.  The OSPF Interface Instance ID will be added to this
   structure.  The OSPF Interface Instance ID will default to 0.  Its
   setting to a non-zero value may be accomplished through configuration
   or implied by some usage beyond the scope of this document.

3.1.  Sending and Receiving OSPF packets

   When sending OSPF packets, if the OSPF Interface Instance ID has a
   non-zero value, it will be set in the OSPF packet header.  When
   receiving OSPF packets, the OSPFv2 Header Instance ID will be used to
   aid in demultiplexing the packet and routing it to the correct OSPFv2
   instance.  Received packets with an Instance ID not equal to one of
   the configured OSPF Instance IDs on the receiving interface MUST be
   discarded.

4.  State Sharing Optimizations between OSPF instances

   This is beyond the scope of this draft and is an area for further
   study.

5.  Backward Compatibility and Deployment Considerations

   When there are OSPF routers that support OSPF Multi-Instance
   extensions on the same broadcast capable link as OSPF routers that do
   not, packets with non-zero OSPF header Instance IDs will be received
   by those legacy OSPF routers.  Since the authentication type will be
   unknown to them they will drop the packet due to an authentication
   failure.  This is exactly what is expected and desired.

   Previously, there was concern that certain implementations would log
   every single authentication type mismatch.  Additionally, if
   ospfIfAuthFailure SNMP trap[OSPF-MIB] generation is enabled, a
   separate trap would be generated for each received OSPF packet with a
   non-zero Instance ID.  However, discussions with implementers have
   led us to the conclusion that this is not as severe a problem as we'd
   first thought and it will be even less of a problem by the time the
   mechanism in this draft is standardized, implemented, and deployed.
   Most implementations will dampen both the log entries and the
   generation of identical SNMP traps.  Hence, the more drastic
   mechanisms to avoid legacy OSPF routers from receiving multicast OSPF
   packets with non-zero Instance IDs have been removed.

6.  Security Considerations

   The enhancement described herein doesn't add any additional security
   considerations to OSPFv2.  Security considerations for OSPFv2 are
   described in [OSPFV2].

   Given that only three OSPFv2 authentication types have been
   standardized, it seems reasonable to reduce the OSPF packet header
   field to 8 bits.

7.  IANA Considerations

   A new registry will be added for OSPF Instance IDs.  The allocation
   of OSPF Instance IDs is described below.
