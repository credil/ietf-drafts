       Mobile IPv6 and Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 protocols require the
       signaling messages between the mobile node and home agent to be
       secured. However security for  
       the user plane/traffic is optional and is a choice left to the mobile node. 
       This document proposes extensions to Mobile IPv6 signaling which 
       enables the user plane traffic to be secured on a need or on-demand basis. The 
       mobile node or the home agent can request at any time security for 
       the user plane traffic. Security for user plane traffic can be 
       triggered as a result of policy or, mobility or, at the user's choice.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC3775" /> and Dual-stack Mobile
	IPv6 <xref target="RFC5555" /> provide  
	the option to secure the user plane data between the Mobile Node 
	(MN) and and the Home Agent (HA) when needed. The user plane traffic 
	between the MN and HA is secured via an IPsec security association 
	(SA) which is established between them specifically for the purpose 
	of user plane data. IPsec is used for securing the user plane 
	traffic when the security between the MN and HA is based on IPsec. 
	However security between the MN and HA could also be enabled via 
	other protocols. The MEXT WG is evaluating on an experimental basis 
	various alternatives to IPsec such as the one specified in
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-mext-mip6-tls"/>. 
	</t>
      <t>
	As per the current specifications for MIP6 and DSMIP6, security of 
	the user plane traffic is optional. When the MN is attached to 3G/4G 
	network such as HSPA, LTE or EV-DO, the MN may not require security 
	for the user plane traffic since these networks already provide 
	ciphering over the air-interface and deploy hop-by-hop security, 
	which makes these networks secure. However the MN may attach to less 
	secure or unsecured accesses such as wireless lan (WLAN) or it may 
	roam in countries where the user may prefer the data between the MN 
	and the HA to be encrypted (even when using cellular accesses). 
	There is no solution in the protocol specification today which 
	provides the capability to trigger the security for the user plane 
	traffic on a need basis.  
      </t>
      <t>    
	The problem that is being addressed is the triggering of security 
	for user plane traffic between the MN and HA on a need basis. Policy 
	information at the MN or information provided to the MN via other 
	means at the time of attachment may assist the MN to determine if 
	security needs to be enabled for user plane traffic. The user may 
	also consciously decide to enable security when attached to certain 
	networks. Furthermore, the operator of HA may have policies that 
	define when user plane security is to be used. This document 
	describes a mechanism which can enable security for user plane 
	traffic on-demand or need. 
      </t>
      <t>
	An obvious implementation alternative would be to encrypt user plane 
	traffic always (as is commonly done with VPN use-cases), but that 
	would unnecessarily consume resources on the HA. For the HA operator 
	there is clear economic incentive to encrypt user-plane data only 
	when necessary. 
	The MIP6/DSMIP6 protocols only provide a means to secure the user 
	plane traffic but do not provide any mechanisms by which the 
	security is triggered as a result of mobility or the MN attaching 
	via different access networks. 
      </t>
      <t>
	As per the current MIP6 <xref target="RFC3775" />
	specification, only the MN has the  
	ability to enable security for user-plane traffic. The HA has no 
	ability to force the MN to secure user traffic. 
      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="When to apply Security to user plane traffic">
	<t>
	  An MN MUST have security for the control plane messages. Hence all 
	  signaling between the MN and HA are secured. The MN establishes an 
	  IPsec SA between itself and the assigned HA prior to sending a 
	  Binding Update. However, the MN is not required to establish an SA 
	  for securing the user plane traffic. It is up to the MN whether it 
	  establishes SAs for the control plane and user plane at the same 
	  time or if it only establishes the control plane SA. The MN may 
	  choose to establish the SA for user plane traffic at any time 
	  <xref target="RFC4877" />. 
	</t>
	<t>
	  When the MN attaches to an access network, it is usually able to 
	  determine if the access network is viewed as trusted or untrusted. 
	  The MN can make this determination, for example, based on the PLMN 
	  ID of the cellular network; or wifi_SSID/MAC_address of a wifi 
	  network; or location information provided by the MN, or user input. 
	  The MN has either a stored policy about trusted and untrusted access 
	  networks or it may be provided with such information from policy 
	  stores such as the ANDSF <xref target="23.402" /> or AAA server at the time of 
	  network attachment. An interface exists generally between the policy 
	  store such as AAA or ANDSF and the Home Agent (HA).   
	  If the MN is attached to an access network which is viewed as 
	  trusted or where encryption is not allowed, the MN chooses not to 
	  secure the user plane traffic.  
	</t>
	<t>
	  If the MN is attached to an access network which is not trusted, the 
	  MN may want to secure its user plane traffic. The HA may also be 
	  able to determine from the source address of the binding update (BU) 
	  message the access network to which the MN is currently attached. 
	  Based on this information, the HA may require that the user plane 
	  traffic be encrypted on the MN-HA link. 
	</t>
	<t>
	  The MN or HA can determine when to use security for the user plane 
	  traffic using static policies or dynamic policies which can be 
	  obtained at the time of network attachment; or e.g. which are 
	  provisioned and maintained on a smartcard (eg, a UICC or SIM). 3GPP 
	  policy stores such as the ANDSF can also provide information about 
	  the access networks to which an MN is attached. Location of the MN 
	  can also be used as input. 
	</t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Triggering user plane traffic security">
     <t>
       This document proposes extensions to MIPv6/DSMIPv6 protocol, 
       allowing the MN to signal to the HA its preference for user plane 
       traffic security, and for the HA to override that preference based 
       on the policy settings. 
     </t>
     <t>
       One of the reserved bits of the Binding Update
       <xref target="RFC3775" /> message is 
       defined to be the 'Security' flag "S", and one of the reserved bits 
       of the Binding Acknowledgement <xref target="RFC3775" />
       message is also defined to  
       be the 'Security' flag "S". 
     </t>
     <t>
       The MN sends a binding update with the "S" flag set to 0, when 
       indicating that the user plane traffic will not be encrypted. The HA 
       processes the binding update message from the MN and sends a 
       response acknowledging the request and setting the flag for user 
       plane traffic security to Null indicating to the MN that the traffic 
       on the link between the MN and HA will not be encrypted. 
     </t>
     <t>
       The MN sends a binding update with the "S" flag set to 1, when 
       indicating that prefers the user plane traffic be encrypted. The HA 
       processes the binding update message from the MN and sends a 
       response acknowledging the request and setting the flag for user 
       plane traffic security to 1, indicating to the MN that the traffic 
       on the link between the MN and HA will be encrypted. 
     </t>
     <t>
       The HA MAY always overwrite the MN's security preference on the user 
       plane traffic indicated in the Binding Update message, by setting 
       the "S" flag in the Binding Acknowledgement to a different value. 
       The MN SHALL always follow the indication in the Binding 
       Acknowledgement to set the security of the MN to HA user plane 
       traffic.
