    Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) Additions to LIST Command
                   draft-elie-nntp-list-additions-01

Abstract

   This document defines a set of enhancements to the Network News
   Transfer Protocol (NNTP) that allows a client to request extended
   information maintained by NNTP servers as for local use and
   distribution policy.  These enhancements are made as new keywords to
   the existing LIST capability described in RFC 3977.

   This memo updates and formalizes the LIST DISTRIBUTIONS and LIST
   SUBSCRIPTIONS commands defined in RFC 2980.  It also adds the LIST
   COUNTS, LIST MODERATORS and LIST MOTD commands, and specifies
   additional values returned by the existing LIST ACTIVE command for
   the status of a newsgroup.

Status of This Memo

Internet-Draft       NNTP Additions to LIST Command         January 2010


1.  Introduction

   The NNTP specification [RFC3977] defines the LIST capability and a
   few keywords which can be used with that command:  ACTIVE,
   ACTIVE.TIMES, DISTRIB.PATS, HEADERS, NEWSGROUPS, and OVERVIEW.FMT.
   As other widely used variants of the LIST command currently exist,
   they are formalized in this document.

   The DISTRIBUTIONS and SUBSCRIPTIONS variants have originally been
   documented in [RFC2980].  The LIST DISTRIBUTIONS command is sent by a
   news client to obtain a list of relevant distributions known by a
   news server along with their descriptions.  The LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS
   command is sent by a news client when first connecting to a news
   server so as to obtain a list of recommended newsgroups available on
   it.  Both of these commands are intended to be used in place of hard-
   coding news clients to use specific distributions or look for
   specific default newsgroups.

   The MOTD variant has originally been documented in
   [I-D.draft-hernacki-nntplist] (which also defines the SUBSCRIPTIONS
   variant).  The LIST MOTD command is sent by a news client to obtain a
   "message of the day" containing useful information regarding the
   current state of a news server.

   The COUNTS and MODERATORS variants have not been documented before.
   The LIST COUNTS command is the same as LIST ACTIVE, except that it
   also returns an estimated number of articles in every newsgroup.  The
   LIST MODERATORS command is sent by a news client to obtain a list of
   associations between a moderated newsgroup and its submission
   address.

   The ACTIVE variant has already been documented in [RFC3977] but the
   meaning of only three status fields in response to the LIST ACTIVE
   command has been specified:  "y", "n", and "m".  These status are
   particularly useful for readers since they describe local posting
   rights.  This memo defines five other values for the status field:
   "Y", "M", "x", "j", and "=" followed by the name of a newsgroup.
   These new status are particularly useful for peers since they mainly
   describe how remote articles coming from peers are locally handled by
   the news server.

   This specification is to be read in conjunction with the NNTP base
   specification [RFC3977].  Except where specifically stated otherwise,
   in the case of a conflict between these two documents, [RFC3977]
   takes precedence over this one.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The notational conventions used in this document are the same as
   those in [RFC3977], and any term not defined in this document has the
   same meaning as it does in that one.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   When a hexadecimal correspondence is given to an octet in this
   document, the value is in US-ASCII [ASCII] (for instance ".", noted
   %x2E).

   In the examples, commands from the client are indicated with [C], and
   responses from the server are indicated with [S].  The client is the
   initiator of the NNTP connection; the server is the other endpoint.

2.  New LIST Variants

   The LIST capability is defined in Section 7.6 of [RFC3977].  It
   allows the server to provide blocks of useful information to the
   client.

   This document provides five new keywords to the LIST capability:
   COUNTS, DISTRIBUTIONS, MODERATORS, MOTD, and SUBSCRIPTIONS.

   All these keywords are optional and correspond to an eponymous
   variant of the LIST command.

2.1.  Advertising the New LIST Variants

   When a news server implements a variant of the LIST command as
   described in this specification, it advertises the corresponding
   feature in the LIST capability.  Where one of these new LIST keywords
   is advertised, it MUST have the meaning given in this specification.

   For instance, if a news server implements the SUBSCRIPTIONS variant,
   it will add the SUBSCRIPTIONS keyword to the LIST capability in
   response to the CAPABILITIES command (see Section 5.2 of [RFC3977]):

   For all the new LIST variants described in this specification, an
   empty response can be sent to the client:

      [C] LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS
      [S] 215 List of recommended newsgroups follows
      [S] .

   It means that the information is maintained by the news server but
   that it is voluntarily empty.  As often as not, the news server
   maintains the information in a configuration file.  This file can be
   empty or contain only commented or blank lines, which leads to a
   voluntary absence of information.

   When the news server does not maintain the information (for instance
   when the configuration file does not exist), the 503 response code
   MUST be returned:

      [C] LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS
      [S] 503 No list of recommended newsgroups available

2.2.2.  Description

   See Section 7.6.1 of [RFC3977] for general requirements of the LIST
   command.

   The counts list returns a list of valid newsgroups carried by the
   news server along with associated information.

   The information is returned as a multi-line data block following the
   215 response code and contains one line per newsgroup.  Each line of
   this list MUST consist of five fields separated from each other by
   one or more spaces (the usual practice is a single space) in the
   following order:

   o  The name of the newsgroup.

   o  The reported high water mark for the group.

   o  The reported low water mark for the group.

   o  The estimated number of articles in the group.

   o  The current status of the group on this server.

   The reported high and low water marks, and the estimated number of
   articles are as described in the GROUP command (see Section 6.1.1 of
   [RFC3977]), but note that they are in the opposite order to the 211
   response to that command.  The current status of the group is as
   described in the LIST ACTIVE command (see Section 7.6.3 of [RFC3977],
   as well as Section 2.2 of this document).

   The order of newsgroups in the list is not significant.

   The same newsgroup SHOULD NOT appear twice in the output of this
   command.

   The counts list is newsgroup-based, and a wildmat MAY be specified,
   in which case the response is limited to only the groups, if any,
   whose names match the wildmat.  If no wildmat is specified, the
   server MUST include every newsgroup that the client is permitted to
   select with the GROUP command (see Section 6.1.1 of [RFC3977]).

   The counts list MAY be empty.  If the server does not maintain the
   information, a 503 response code MUST be returned.  (However, note
   that a news server that supports this command usually maintains the
   information.)

   The client MAY use LIST COUNTS in order to obtain an estimate of the

   number of articles in every newsgroup the server carries, which
   enables it to provide the end user with this information.  Instead of
   using LIST ACTIVE and separate GROUP commands to get the estimated
   number of articles in newsgroups, the client may therefore use LIST
   COUNTS.

2.2.3.  Examples

   Example of output with no argument:

      [S] comp.risks 442001 441099 742 m
      [S] local.empty 7 8 0 Y
      [S] .

   Example of output with a wildmat:

      [C] LIST COUNTS comp.*,misc.*
      [S] 215 List of newsgroups follows
      [S] misc.test 3002322 3000234 1234 y
      [S] comp.risks 442001 441099 742 m
      [S] .

   Example of output on an implementation that includes leading zeroes:

      [C] LIST COUNTS
      [S] 215 List of newsgroups follows
      [S] misc.test 0003002322 0003000234 1234 y
      [S] comp.risks 0000442001 0000441099 742 m
      [S] local.empty 0000000007 0000000008 0 Y
      [S] .

   The estimated number of articles usually does not start with leading
   zeroes, but MAY have them.

2.3.  LIST DISTRIBUTIONS

Internet-Draft       NNTP Additions to LIST Command         January 2010


2.3.1.  Usage

   Syntax
      LIST DISTRIBUTIONS

   Responses
      215    Distributions list follows (multi-line)

2.3.2.  Description

   See Section 7.6.1 of [RFC3977] for general requirements of the LIST
   command.

   The distributions list is maintained by some NNTP servers to contain
   the name of each distribution that is known by the news server and a
   short description about the meaning of the distribution.

   The information is returned as a multi-line data block following the
   215 response code and contains one line per distribution.  Each line
   of this list MUST consist of two fields separated from each other by
   one or more space or TAB characters (the usual practice is a single
   TAB).  The first field is the name of the distribution, and the
   second field is a short description of the distribution.  There are
   no leading or trailing whitespaces in a line.  The description MAY
   contain whitespaces.

   The order of distributions in the list is not significant; the server
   need not even consistently return the same order or the same results
   if this command is used more than once in a session.

   The same distribution SHOULD NOT appear twice in the output of this
   command.

   The description MUST be in UTF-8.

   The distributions list is not newsgroup-based, and an argument MUST
   NOT be specified.  Otherwise, a 501 response code MUST be returned.

   The distributions list MAY be empty.  If the server does not maintain
   the information, a 503 response code MUST be returned.

   The client MAY use this information to provide the user with a list
   of known distributions he can use.  If the news server implements the
   LIST DISTRIBUTIONS command, it SHOULD also implement the LIST
   DISTRIB.PATS command and describe in the distributions list at least
   all the distributions present in the distrib.pats list so that the
   client can use both of these commands jointly.  The distrib.pats list
   is defined in Section 7.6.5 of [RFC3977]; it assists clients to

   choose a value for the content of the Distribution header of a news
   article being posted (see Section 3.2.4 of [RFC5536] for the
   definition of this header).

2.3.3.  Example

   Example of a joint use of LIST DISTRIB.PATS and LIST DISTRIBUTIONS:

2.4.  LIST MODERATORS

2.4.1.  Usage

   Syntax
      LIST MODERATORS

   Responses

2.4.2.  Description

   See Section 7.6.1 of [RFC3977] for general requirements of the LIST
   command.

   The moderators list is maintained by some NNTP servers to make
   clients aware of the submission address the news server will use when
   an article is locally posted to a moderated newsgroup.

   The information is returned as a multi-line data block following the
   215 response code.  Each line of this list MUST consist of two fields

Internet-Draft       NNTP Additions to LIST Command         January 2010


   separated from each other by a colon (":" or %x3A).  The first field
   is a wildmat (which may be a simple newsgroup name), and the second
   field is the submission address for newsgroups matching that wildmat.
   There are no leading or trailing whitespaces in a line.  The
   submission address MAY contain colons (":").

   The order of lines in the list is significant:  the first matching
   line is used.  Consequently, specific patterns should be listed
   before general patterns.  Every moderated newsgroup name SHOULD be
   matched by at least one line in the list.

   When an unapproved article is locally posted to a moderated
   newsgroup, it is forwarded to a moderator (see Section 3.5.1 of
   [RFC5537]), using the submission address for that newsgroup.  This
   submission address is the second field of the first matching line in
   the moderators list.  It is an e-mail address with one exception:  at
   most one occurrence of the case-sensitive string "%s" (%x25.73) may
   occur anywhere in the address.  If present, the news server will
   replace it, when forwarding the article to the moderator, with the
   name of the matching newsgroup, with all periods ("." or %x2E) in the
   name changed to dashes ("-" or %x2D).  If there is a literal "%" in
   the submission address, it MUST be written as "%%", even if not
   followed by an "s".

      NOTE:  How submission addresses are created and maintained is
      outside the scope of this specification.

   The moderators list is not newsgroup-based, and an argument MUST NOT
   be specified.  Otherwise, a 501 response code MUST be returned.

   The moderators list MAY be empty.  If the server does not maintain
   the information, a 503 response code MUST be returned, though these
   two cases SHOULD NOT occur if the news server is an injecting agent
   that carries moderated newsgroups.

   The following table describes a few examples of associations between
   a moderated newsgroup and its submission address on a news server
   whose moderators list is the one of the previous example:

   +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+
   | Name of the moderated       | Submission address                  |
   | newsgroup                   |                                     |

   | alt.test-me                 | alt-test-me@moderators.example.com  |
   +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+

      NOTE:  When "%s" is used, periods are changed to dashes, and
      dashes are left alone.  It implies that two moderated newsgroups
      whose names differ only by changing a period to a dash would go to
      the same address.  Therefore, if such moderated newsgroup pairs
      exist with different submission addresses, a "%s" pattern rule
      cannot be used for the moderation submission addresses for those
      groups, and explicit entries without a pattern will be required.

      Similarly, a "%s" pattern rule cannot be used for the moderation
      submission address for two moderated newsgroups whose names differ
      only by the case of their characters.  See also Section 3.1.4 of
      [RFC5536] and Section 7.2 of [I-D.ietf-usefor-useage] for the
      syntax of a newsgroup name.

   Syntax
      LIST MOTD

   Responses
      215    Information follows (multi-line)

2.5.2.  Description

   See Section 7.6.1 of [RFC3977] for general requirements of the LIST
   command.

   The motd list contains a "message of the day" relevant to the news
   server.  It is intended to provide notification and communication
   between the news administrator and the news user.  For instance,
   notification of upcoming downtime or information about new facilities
   available on the news server can be advertised via this means of
   communication.

   The information is returned as a multi-line data block following the
   215 response code.  This text is not guaranteed to be in any
   particular format although, like all multi-line data blocks, it is
   "dot-stuffed".

   The server need not return the same information if this command is
   used more than once in a session.  It MAY indeed send a different
   message of the day depending on the state of the session.  For
   instance, on a mode-switching news server, the information can be
   different between its transit mode and its reader mode, or between an
   authenticated session and an unauthenticated session.

   The information MUST be in UTF-8.

   The motd list is not newsgroup-based, and an argument MUST NOT be
   specified.  Otherwise, a 501 response code MUST be returned.

   The motd list MAY be empty.  If the server does not maintain the
   information, a 503 response code MUST be returned.

   It is up to the client to decide when and how to display this message
   to the user.  No timestamp or date of last modification date is
   provided.  The client may want to keep some state if it wishes to
   show the message only upon modification.

   Parameters

2.6.2.  Description

   See Section 7.6.1 of [RFC3977] for general requirements of the LIST
   command.

   The subscriptions list is maintained by some NNTP servers to provide
   the client with a list of recommended newsgroups.

   The information is returned as a multi-line data block following the
   215 response code.  Each line of this list MUST consist of a
   newsgroup name.  There are no leading or trailing whitespaces in a
   line.

   The order of newsgroups in the list is significant:  they are listed
   by order of importance, the first newsgroup being the most important
   to subscribe to.

   The same newsgroup name SHOULD NOT appear twice in the output of this

   command.  The list SHOULD contain only newsgroups the news server
   carries.

   The subscriptions list is newsgroup-based, and a wildmat MAY be
   specified, in which case the response is limited to only the groups,
   if any, whose names match the wildmat.  Note that the wildmat
   argument is a new feature in this specification and servers that do
   not support CAPABILITIES or do not advertise the SUBSCRIPTIONS
   keyword in the LIST capability (and therefore do not conform to this
   specification) are unlikely to support it.

   The subscriptions list MAY be empty.  If the server does not maintain
   the information, a 503 response code MUST be returned.

   The client MAY use this information the first time it connects to the
   news server so as to initialize the list of default subscribed
   newsgroups.  This list should therefore contain groups intended for
   new users on the news server or Usenet in general.  For instance
   newsgroups dedicated to testing, support, announcement, or FAQs.  The
   client MAY present the groups in the order of appearance in the list
   to the user.  When the subscriptions list is maintained and non
   empty, the news client SHOULD use it, instead of a hard-coded default
   list, if any.

3.  Additions to LIST ACTIVE

   This document specifies five new status fields that can be used in
   the answers to LIST ACTIVE:  "Y", "M", "x", "j", and "=" followed by
   the name of a newsgroup.

3.1.  New status fields

   The LIST ACTIVE command is defined in Section 7.6.3 of [RFC3977].
   The fourth field of each line of this list indicates the current
   status of the newsgroup whose name is specified in the first field.
   Three status are defined in [RFC3977]:

   "y"  Posting is permitted.

   "n"  Posting is not permitted.

   "m"  Postings will be forwarded to the newsgroup moderator.

   This document defines five other case-sensitive status which can also
   be used:

   "Y"  Only local posting is permitted.

   "M"  Only local posting is permitted and will be forwarded to the
      newsgroup moderator.

   "x"  Postings and articles from peers are not permitted.

   "j"  Only articles from peers are permitted but no articles are
      locally filed.

   "=other.group"  Only articles from peers are permitted, and are filed
      under the newsgroup named "other.group".

   The server SHOULD use these values when these meanings are required
   and MUST NOT use them with any other meaning.

   A newsgroup with status "Y" is a newsgroup with status "y" wherein
   articles from peers are not accepted.  Similarly, a newsgroup with
   status "M" is a newsgroup with status "m" wherein articles from peers
   are not accepted.  The fact that a newsgroup has a "Y" or an "M"
   status does not necessarily imply that the articles posted to it
   cannot be propagated to other news servers.

   The difference between a newsgroup with status "n" and a newsgroup



Elie                      Expires July 12, 2010                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft       NNTP Additions to LIST Command         January 2010


   with status "x" is that articles from peers are accepted for the
   former, and rejected for the latter.  A newsgroup with status "x" is
   considered as closed:  no new articles will arrive in such a group.
   On the contrary, articles from peers will arrive in a newsgroup with
   status "n".  Local postings are not allowed in a newsgroup with one
   of these two status.

   The differences between a newsgroup with status "y" and a newsgroup
   with status "j" are that articles are filed into the corresponding
   newsgroup for the former, and not locally filed for the latter;
   besides, local postings are accepted for the former, and rejected for
   the latter.  If an article is received from a peer in a newsgroup
   with status "j", and in case it is not crossposted to some other
   valid groups, it will not be filed into a newsgroup on the news
   server.  Yet, this article will still be propagated to other peers,
   if appropriate.  Otherwise, in case this article is crossposted to
   some other valid groups, it will be filed only into the valid
   newsgroups it is crossposted to.

      NOTE:  Instead of not filing at all an article posted to a
      newsgroup with status "j", a news server MAY file it under a
      catch-all group.  When a news server uses a catch-all group to
      file the articles posted to newsgroups with status "j", this
      catch-all group SHOULD be named "junk".  (The first letter of the
      "junk" newsgroup explains why this status has been called "j".)

      Consequently, when a news server carries the "junk" newsgroup and
      uses it for the purpose of the "j" status, the "junk" newsgroup
      contains all postings not filed under another newsgroup, whatever
      the status of the "junk" newsgroup is.  (However, an article
      posted explicitly to "junk" is treated according to the status of
      the "junk" newsgroup.)

      This newsgroup may be available to news readers and is often used
      by a news server as a way to locally store an article with the
      view to transmitting it to its peers (which may carry some of the
      newsgroups the article was posted to).  Besides, instead of
      rejecting an article which contains an invalid Newsgroups header
      or which is posted to newsgroups it does not carry, a news server
      may accept such an article and file it under this catch-all "junk"
      newsgroup.

      Depending on the configuration of the news server, mentioning a
      newsgroup with status "j" is different than simply not listing the
      group, since articles arriving in unknown newsgroups may be
      rejected.

   When the status field begins with an equal sign ("=" or %x3D), the



Elie                      Expires July 12, 2010                [Page 17]

   name of an existing newsgroup on the news server MUST immediately
   follow the sign.  If the status field of "foo.bar" is "=other.group",
   it means that "foo.bar" is an alias for "other.group".  These two
   newsgroups are distinct; they do not share their articles or their
   article numbers.  Local postings to "foo.bar" are not allowed, but
   articles from peers are accepted for "foo.bar" and filed into
   "other.group", regardless of the status of "other.group".  The
   contents of their Newsgroups headers MUST NOT be altered.

   Alias groups are typically used during a transition between two
   newsgroups, including but not limited to a renaming of a group, or a
   correction of a misspelled group name.

   An alias SHOULD NOT point to another alias group.  The newsgroup an
   alias points to SHOULD exist on the news server.  If an alias is
   listed in the active list, the newsgroup it points to is not also
   listed in the active list when a wildmat is given to the LIST ACTIVE
   command, and the name of the newsgroup the alias points to does not
   match this wildmat.

      NOTE:  If a server files newsgroups with status "j" into "junk", a
      newsgroup with status "j" and a newsgroup with status "=junk" are
      different.  An article fed by a peer, and crossposted to a group
      with status "j", will result in the article being filed only in
      "junk" if there are no other groups with which to file it, or
      otherwise only in other valid newsgroups it is crossposted to.
      Whereas an article fed by a peer, and crossposted to a group with
      status "=junk", will result in the article being filed in "junk"
      and in other valid newsgroups it is crossposted to.

   The following table summarizes what usually happens to an article
   posted to only the newsgroup "foo.bar", depending on its status field
   on the news server:

   +--------------+-----------+------------+------------+--------------+
   | Status field | Accepted  | Accepted   | Moderation | Destination  |

      NOTE:  The status of a newsgroup only indicates how articles
      arriving to that newsgroup are normally processed; news servers
      MAY provide clients with special privileges to allow or disallow
      some rights in these newsgroups.  This specification defines
      neither these rights nor whether or not articles posted to these
      groups should be propagated to other peers.

4.  Augmented BNF Syntax for These Additions to the LIST Command

   This section describes the formal syntax of the new LIST variants
   defined in this document using [RFC5234].  It extends the syntax in
   Section 9 of [RFC3977], and non-terminals not defined in this
   document are defined there.  The [RFC3977] ABNF should be imported
   first before attempting to validate these rules.

4.1.  Commands

   This syntax extends the non-terminal <list-arguments> which
   represents the variants of the LIST command.

     ; counts
     list-arguments =/ "COUNTS" [WS wildmat]

     ; distributions, moderators, motd
     list-arguments =/ "DISTRIBUTIONS" / "MODERATORS" / "MOTD"

     ; subscriptions
     list-arguments =/ "SUBSCRIPTIONS" [WS wildmat]

4.2.  Responses

   This syntax extends the non-terminals <newsgroup-status> and <list-
   content> which respectively represent the status field returned by
   the LIST ACTIVE command and the response contents for the LIST

5.  Internationalisation Considerations

   No new internationalisation considerations are introduced by this
   extension, beyond those already described in the core specification
   [RFC3977].

   In particular, newsgroup names SHOULD be restricted to US-ASCII until
   a successor to [RFC5536] standardizes another approach.

   Distribution descriptions and the message of the day MUST be in
   UTF-8.

6.  Security Considerations

   No new security considerations are introduced by this extension,
   beyond those already described in the core specification [RFC3977]

   and the Netnews Architecture and Protocol [RFC5537] (especially
   distribution leakage and e-mail Denial of Service during the
   moderation process).

7.  IANA Considerations

   This section gives a formal definition of this extension as required
   by Section 3.3.3 of [RFC3977] for the IANA registry.

   o  This extension provides additional keywords to the existing LIST
      capability defined in Section 7.6 of [RFC3977].  New status are
      also added to the ACTIVE variant of the LIST command.

   o  The capability label that this extension extends is "LIST".

   o  This extension adds five optional arguments to the "LIST"
      capability label:  "COUNTS", "DISTRIBUTIONS", "MODERATORS",
      "MOTD", and "SUBSCRIPTIONS", indicating which new variants of the
      LIST command are supported.

   o  This extension defines five new commands, LIST COUNTS, LIST
      DISTRIBUTIONS, LIST MODERATORS, LIST MOTD, and LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS,
      whose behaviour, arguments, and responses are defined in Sections
      2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 respectively.

   o  This extension does not associate any new responses with pre-
      existing NNTP commands.

   o  This extension does not affect the maximum length of commands or
      initial response lines.

   o  This extension does not alter pipelining, and the LIST COUNTS,
      LIST DISTRIBUTIONS, LIST MODERATORS, LIST MOTD, and LIST
      SUBSCRIPTIONS commands can be pipelined.

   o  Use of this extension does not alter the capabilities list.

   o  This extension does not cause any pre-existing command to produce
      a 401, 480, or 483 response.

   o  This extension is unaffected by any use of the MODE READER
      command.

   o  This extension does not affect the overall behaviour of a server
      or client than via the new commands.

   o  Published Specification:  This document.

Appendix A.  Document History (to be removed by RFC Editor before
             publication)

Appendix A.1.  Changes from -00

   o  Add this appendix.

   o  Acknowledge Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho's and D. Stussy's remarks.

   o  Refer to USEFOR (RFC 5536) and USEAGE instead of putting a SHOULD
      requirement on the name of newsgroups in the example of the LIST
      MODERATORS command.  Besides, the note was only related to the
      presence of "%s" in the submission address.

   o  Mention that every moderated newsgroup name SHOULD have a matching
      line in LIST MODERATORS.

   o  The presence of "+" in the name of a newsgroup is a matter of
      configuration and should not be dealt with in this memo.  If any
      special interpretation is applied by the MTA or MDA of the
      receiving site, and if they want to host a submission address for
      a moderated group determined by a "%s" pattern rule, they will
      need to suppress that interpretation.

   o  Lowercase a "MAY" for the reject of articles arriving in unknown
      newsgroups.

   o  The meaning of the "j" status flag has changed:  the "junk"
      newsgroup is no longer required.  A group with status "j" now only
      means that no articles are filed under it.  Moreover, local
      postings to "j" newsgroups are not accepted.

Internet-Draft       NNTP Additions to LIST Command         January 2010


   o  Add an explanation about how the status of the "junk" newsgroup
      affects articles posted to "junk" or newsgroups with status "j".

   o  Add a note about the difference between the "j" and "=junk"
      status.

   o  The status of the newsgroup to which an alias group points is no
      longer checked.  An article is directly filed under it.  Besides,
      the requirement for an alias not pointing to another alias group
      becomes a SHOULD NOT instead of a MUST NOT.

   o  Add an example of article locally posted to an alias group.

   o  Remove the fact that if a news server may accept articles from a
      client during the session (possibly after successful
      authentication), it SHOULD NOT return a status like "n" or "x"
      which suggests that articles are not accepted in the corresponding
      newsgroup.

   o  Document the "Y" and "M" status.

   o  Document the COUNTS variant for the LIST command.

   o  The "r" status flag will be documented in another (experimental)
      draft.  A new REMOVALS variant for the LIST command is needed.

   o  Add a reference to [ASCII].
