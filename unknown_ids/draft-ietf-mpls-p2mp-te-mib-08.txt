1. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling
   point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   traffic engineering (TE).

   MPLS is defined in [RFC3031] and a signaling protocol for
   point-to-point (P2P) MPLS-TE (TE extensions to the Resource
   Reservation Protocol - RSVP-TE) is defined in [RFC3209]. RSVP-TE is
   extended for use in a P2MP environment by [RFC4875] following the
   requirements set out in [RFC4461].

   [RFC3812] provides a MIB module for modeling and controlling P2P
   MPLS-TE in conjunction with Textual Conventions defined in [RFC3811].
   In addition, [RFC3813] defines a MIB module for modeling and
   controlling an MPLS Label Switching Router (LSR) that may support
   MPLS-TE. An overview of MPLS MIB modules can be found in [RFC4221].

   This document defines a MIB module for managing and controlling P2MP
   MPLS-TE. It builds on the objects and tables defined in [RFC3812] so
   that P2MP MPLS-TE management is an extension of P2P MPLS-TE
   management.

   In addition, this document provides a description of how to use the
   LSR MIB module [RFC3813] to model and control an LSR that supports
   P2MP MPLS-TE.

   The MIB module defined in this document and the usage of the LSR MIB
   module are equally applicable to Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) in
   association with the GMPLS TE MIB module defined in [RFC4802] and the
   GMPLS LSR MIB module defined in [RFC4803].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).


Farrel, Yasukawa, and Nadeau                                    [Page 3]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-te-mib-08.txt         March 2009


   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3. Feature List

   The feature list for this MIB module is built on the feature list for
   the P2P MPLS-TE MIB module [RFC3812]. The features in the list below
   are marked with a star (*) if they are new features for this MIB
   module and with a circle (o) if they are satisfied by [RFC3812].
   *  The MIB module supports configuration of point-to-multipoint
      unidirectional tunnels.

   o  MPLS tunnels need not be interfaces, but it is possible to
      configure a tunnel as an interface.

   o  The MIB module supports tunnel establishment via an MPLS
      signaling protocol wherein the tunnel parameters are specified
      using this MIB module at the head end of the LSP, and end-to-end
      tunnel LSP establishment is accomplished via signaling.  The MIB
      module also supports manually configured tunnels, i.e., those for
      which label associations at each hop of the tunnel LSP are
      provisioned by the administrator via the LSR MIB [RFC3813].

   o  The MIB module supports persistent, as well as non-persistent
      tunnels.

4. Outline

   Point-to-point MPLS-TE utilizes MPLS tunnels running from source to
   destination. Each tunnel is supported by one or more label switched
   paths (LSPs). This is described in the signaling specification
   [RFC3209] and the document that describes the MPLS-TE MIB module
   [RFC3812].

   P2MP MPLS-TE requires that MPLS tunnels are established from a single
   source point (the root) to one or more destination points (the
   leaves). P2MP MPLS-TE tunnels are also supported by one or more P2MP
   LSPs.

   This document models a P2MP LSP as a set of source-to-leaf (S2L) sub-
   LSPs. That is, the path (or route) from the root to each leaf is
   separately specified for each leaf as a series of loose or strict
   hops. The combination (overlay) of the set of S2L LSPs results in the
   P2MP TE LSP. See [RFC4875] for a more detailed description of S2L
   LSPs and how they are combined to form a P2MP TE LSP.

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-te-mib-08.txt         March 2009


   Other configuration parameters associated with a P2MP MPLS-TE LSP
   describe the forwarding behavior of each LSR along the path of the
   LSP. It should be noted that, according to [RFC4461], these
   configuration parameters are invariant across the branches of a P2MP
   LSP toward different leaves. Thus, they can be configured for whole
   P2MP LSP, and do not need to be configured per leaf.

   The setup of P2MP tunnels can be achieved as:

   - Management actions only, by using [RFC3813] to configure cross-
     connections or forwarding state at the LSRs along the path of the
     tunnel. See Section 6 for more details.

   - Control plane actions (i.e., signaling using [RFC4875]) under the
     direction of a management process, by using [RFC3812] and the MIB
     module defined in this document.

   - Control plane actions ([RFC4875]) under the direction of some other
     management process, and monitored using [RFC3812] and the MIB
     module defined in this document.

   Note that [RFC4802] defines a MIB module that can be used to manage
   and model Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) LSPs - it is a series of MIB
   objects and tables some of which extend tables in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB

   [RFC3812]. [RFC4461] and [RFC4875] are clear that they apply to
   MPLS-TE [RFC3031] and GMPLS [RFC3945]. This document describes a MIB
   module that can be used for both MPLS-TE and GMPLS P2MP LSPs, and all
   objects apply to both MPLS and GMPLS. Note, however, that GMPLS
   defines support for unidirectional and bidirectional LSP, while P2MP
   LSPs can only be unidirectional. Thus, the gmplsTunnelDirection
   object of GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB defined in [RFC4802] MUST be set to
   forward(0) when the LSP is a P2MP LSP.

   The following sections describe the components of the P2MP MPLS-TE
   MIB module. The subsequent section provides an explanation and
   example of how the P2MP MPLS-TE MIB module can be used to configure
   and manage a P2MP tunnel when used in combination with the MPLS-TE
   MIB module defined in [RFC3812]. A further section describes how P2MP
   tunnels can be managed solely through the LSR MIB module defined in
   [RFC3813], and gives an example.

4.1. Summary of the P2MP MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB Module

   The MIB module consists of the following objects and tables:

   - The P2MP Tunnel table (mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable) sparse augments the
     MPLS-TE Tunnel table (mplsTunnelTable) and is used to set up and


Farrel, Yasukawa, and Nadeau                                    [Page 5]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-te-mib-08.txt         March 2009


     monitor P2MP MPLS-TE tunnels.

   - The P2MP Tunnel Destination table (mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable) lists
     the destinations (leaves) of each P2MP MPLS-TE tunnel, provides the
     status of the tunnel to each destination, and supplies pointers
     into the configured hop table, actual route hop table, and computed
     hop table (mplsTunnelHopTable, mplsTunnelARHopTable, and
     mplsTunnelCHopTable) for the routes to each of the destinations.

   - A small collection of scalars (mplsTeP2mpTunnelConfigured,
     mplsTeP2mpTunnelActive, and mplsTeP2mpTunnelTotalMaxHops) give
     information about the P2MP behavior of the LSR.

   These tables and scalars are described in the following sections
   after a description of how the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB module [RFC3812] is
   used as a basis for MIB management and modeling of P2MP MPLS-TE.

4.2. Use of MPLS-TE-STD-MIB

   The MIB module defined in this document builds on the objects and
   tables of MPLS-TE-STD-MIB defined in [RFC3812]. That is, most of the
   basic properties of the MPLS tunnel are modeled and managed by
   objects in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB, and new objects are only defined within
   this document where additional features or different behavior is
   required.

   When an MPLS-TE tunnel is a P2MP tunnel, certain objects in the
   mplsTunnelTable have new meanings just as the signaling objects in
   RSVP-TE [RFC3209] have different meanings when the signaling messages
   are used to establish P2MP LSPs [RFC4875].

   As indicated in the next section, the presence of a conceptual row in
   the mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable of the MIB module defined in this document
   shows that a tunnel defined in the corresponding conceptual row of
   the mplsTunnelTable of MPLS-TE-STD-MIB is a P2MP tunnel. Under those
   circumstances the following scalars and objects from the appropriate
   conceptual rows in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB MUST be interpreted as follows.
   The text below is supplementary to the Description clauses in
   [RFC3812].

   mplsTunnelMaxHops

     This object continues to refer to the maximum number of hops that
     can be configured to a single destination for a tunnel on this
     device. Thus, for a P2MP tunnel, this refers to the maximum number
     of hops that can be configured on this device to any individual
     destination of the tunnel.



Farrel, Yasukawa, and Nadeau                                    [Page 6]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-te-mib-08.txt         March 2009


     A new object, mplsTeP2mpTunnelTotalMaxHops, is defined in this MIB
     module to supply the total number of hops across all destinations
     of a P2MP tunnel. mplsTeP2mpTunnelTotalMaxHops would normally be
     set larger than or equal to mplsTunnelMaxHops.

   mplsTunnelEgressLSRId

      This object continues to map to the field in the RSVP-TE Session
      Object that occupies the space used by the IPv4 Tunnel Endpoint
      Address [RFC3209], but for a P2MP tunnel, this object does not
      identify an address of the egress of the tunnel. Instead it
      contains the P2MP ID value that identifies the identifier of the
      set of destinations for the P2MP tunnel and is carried in the P2MP
      Session Object [RFC4875]. The Description clause for this object
      can be read as follows.

         "Identity of the egress LSR associated with this tunnel
          instance.

          When an entry in the mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable is present
          corresponding to this entry in the mplsTunnelTable, this
          object contains the P2MP ID that identifies the set of
          destinations of this tunnel and that is signaled in the
          P2MP ID field of the P2MP Session Object if the MPLS
          signaling protocol for this tunnel indicated by
          mplsTunnelSignallingProto in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB is rsvp(2)."

      The destinations of the P2MP tunnel are found in the new
      mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable.

   mplsTunnelXCPointer

      If the tunnel is a P2MP tunnel as indicated by the presence of an
      entry in the mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable corresponding to this tunnel,
      this object is not used. This is because there is not necessarily
      a single entry in the mplsXCTable corresponding to the cross-
      connect for the LSP. Instead, the mplsXCTable entries for the LSP
      are found using the mplsXCIndex set to mplsTeP2mpTunnelP2mpXcIndex
      from the mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable; all mplsXCTable entries for the
      same P2MP LSP share a common value of mplsXCIndex.

      If this object is present for a P2MP tunnel, it SHOULD contain the
      value 0.0.

   mplsTunnelHopTableIndex

      If the tunnel is a P2MP tunnel as indicated by the presence of an
      entry in the mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable corresponding to this tunnel,


Farrel, Yasukawa, and Nadeau                                    [Page 7]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-te-mib-08.txt         March 2009


      this object is not used. This is because the destinations and
      paths to those destinations are found in the
      mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable.

      If this object is present for a P2MP tunnel, it SHOULD contain the
      value 0.

   mplsTunnelPathInUse

      If the tunnel is a P2MP tunnel as indicated by the presence of an
      entry in the mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable corresponding to this tunnel,
      this object is not used. This is because the destinations and
      paths to those destinations are found in the
      mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable.

      If this object is present for a P2MP tunnel, it SHOULD contain the
      value 0.

   mplsTunnelARHopTableIndex

      If the tunnel is a P2MP tunnel as indicated by the presence of an
      entry in the mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable corresponding to this tunnel,
      this object is not used. This is because the destinations and
      paths to those destinations are found in the
      mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable.

      If this object is present for a P2MP tunnel, it SHOULD contain the
      value 0.

   mplsTunnelCHopTableIndex

      If the tunnel is a P2MP tunnel as indicated by the presence of an
      entry in the mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable corresponding to this tunnel,
      this object is not used. This is because the destinations and
      paths to those destinations are found in the
      mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable.

      If this object is present for a P2MP tunnel, it SHOULD contain the
      value 0.

4.2.1. Backward Compatiblity Concerns for MIB Read Operations

   A concern may be raised with regard to the changed semantics of the
   objects listed in Section 4.2 within the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB module. What
   would happen if an implementation that was not P2MP-aware attempted
   to read from the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB module and encountered these objects
   with changed semantics? Would it attempt to handle a P2MP LSP as a
   P2P LSP, and would this potentially cause damage to the


Farrel, Yasukawa, and Nadeau                                    [Page 8]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-te-mib-08.txt         March 2009


   implementation?

   To clarify the situation, each of the objects with modified semantics
   is set out below. The term 'legacy system' is used to refer to a
   management station that is not aware of the P2MP-TE-STD-MIB and is
   not aware of the modified sematics of these objects.

   mplsTunnelMaxHops
      If examined by a legacy system, this object will be correctly
      interpreted as it continues to refer to the number of hops to any
      single destination. A legacy system will look to this object to
      determine how many hops it may insert into the path of a P2P LSP,
      and it will get the correct result from this object.

   mplsTunnelEgressLSRId
      This object reflects the value used in the signaling protocol in
      the Session Object. Although the precise semantic of the field is
      different in P2P and P2MP signaling, the use of the field as part
      of the tuple that identifies the LSP is unchanged.

      If a P2MP tunnel is examined by a legacy system, this object will
      be correctly interpreted as the same size and format, and will be
      used to identify the LSP. This will not impact the operation of
      the legacy system.

   mplsTunnelXCPointer
      If a P2MP tunnel is examined by a legacy system, this object will
      report 0.0 giving the impression that no cross-connect entry has
      been set up for the LSP yet. This will not impact the operation of
      the legacy system.

   mplsTunnelHopTableIndex
      If a P2MP tunnel is examined by a legacy system, this object will
      report zero giving the impression that no tunnel hops have been
      configured. This will not impact the operation of the legacy
      system.

   mplsTunnelPathInUse
      If a P2MP tunnel is examined by a legacy system, this object will
      report zero giving the impression that no path is in use or
      available. This will not impact the operation of the legacy
      system.

   mplsTunnelARHopTableIndex
      If a P2MP tunnel is examined by a legacy system, this object will
      report zero giving the impression that no tunnel hops have been
      reported by the signaling protocol. This is a valid scenario and
      will not impact the operation of the legacy system.

   mplsTunnelCHopTableIndex
      If a P2MP tunnel is examined by a legacy system, this object will
      report zero giving the impression that no tunnel hops have been
      computed. This is a valid scenario and will not impact the
      operation of the legacy system.

4.2.2. Backward Compatiblity Concerns for MIB Write Operations

   Although a legacy system may be able to read objects in the
   MPLS-TE-STD-MIB which have modified semantics and operate correctly,
   there is also a concern that the legacy system might try to write to
   these objects, thus modifying the P2MP LSP in an unexpected way.

   This section lists the objects with modified semantics and explains
   how each is safe against write access by a legacy system.

   mplsTunnelMaxHops
      If set by a legacy system, this object will correctly control the
      maximum number of hops in an LSP to a single destination as
      expected by the legacy system.

   mplsTunnelEgressLSRId
      A legacy system that was used to modify this object for a P2MP
      tunnel would be successful and would not damage the operation of
      the P2MP tunnel. All that would happen is that the identity of the
      tunnel would be changed.

   mplsTunnelXCPointer
     If this object is set for a P2MP tunnel by a legacy system, the SET
     will be successful, but the value (i.e. the object) will be ignored
     by the management agent and the object will not be used.

   mplsTunnelHopTableIndex
     If this object is set for a P2MP tunnel by a legacy system, the SET
     will be successful, but the value (i.e. the object) will be ignored
     by the management agent and the object will not be used.

   mplsTunnelPathInUse
     If this object is set for a P2MP tunnel by a legacy system, the SET
     will be successful, but the value (i.e. the object) will be ignored
     by the management agent and the object will not be used.

   mplsTunnelARHopTableIndex
     This object is read-only and cannot be set.

   mplsTunnelCHopTableIndex
     This object is read-only and cannot be set.

4.3. Scalars

   There are three scalars defined for this MIB module.

   mplsTeP2mpTunnelConfigured provides a read-only counter of the number
   of P2MP MPLS-TE tunnels that are configured on this LSR through this
   MIB module.

   mplsTeP2mpTunnelActive provides a read-only counter of the number of
   P2MP MPLS-TE tunnels configured on this LSR through this MIB module
   that are currently active.

   As described in Section 4.2, mplsTeP2mpTunnelTotalMaxHops is a read-
   only scalar that reports the maximum number of explicit route hops
   supported by this LSR for any single P2MP LSP configured or monitored
   through this MIB module. mplsTeP2mpTunnelTotalMaxHops would normally
   be set larger than or equal to mplsTunnelMaxHops.

4.4. mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable

   The mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable extends (through a sparse augmentation) the
   MPLS Tunnel table (mplsTunnelTable) from MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] to
   allow P2MP MPLS-TE tunnels to be created, controlled, and monitored
   at any LSR in the network.

   A P2MP MPLS-TE tunnel may be represented in the MIB, by defining it
   in the mplsTunnelTable and providing objects in this table to
   indicate that it is a P2MP tunnel and to define P2MP-specific
   properties of the tunnel.

4.5. mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable

   P2MP LSPs have multiple destinations and, although the LSP parameters
   (such as bandwidth) for each destination are the same, the explicit
   route requested, computed, and signaled is different for each
   destination. The mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable encodes each destination
   and the information specific to the LSP to that destination.

   mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable is indexed by a set of parameters that
   identify the P2MP LSP itself (tunnel index, tunnel instance, ingress
   LSR ID, egress LSR ID), the P2MP incoming and outgoing sub-groups
   (sub-group origin, sub-group ID), and the destination ID (i.e., a
   leaf).

4.6. mplsTeP2mpTunnelBranchPerfTable

   Per-tunnel statistics are counted in mplsTunnelPerfTable in
   MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812], but these objects are only partially


Farrel, Yasukawa, and Nadeau                                   [Page 11]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-te-mib-08.txt         March 2009


   useful for a P2MP tunnel. The five objects in that table
   (mplsTunnelPerfPackets, mplsTunnelPerfHCPackets,
   mplsTunnelPerfErrors, mplsTunnelPerfBytes, and mplsTunnelPerfHCBytes)
   continue to be used for tunnels that forward packets, and reflect
   the counts of data received on the incoming interfaces and forwarded
   to the downstream interfaces.

   However, in a P2MP tunnel, the downstream interfaces (out-segments)
   may behave differently and so it is appropriate to record the
   performance on each out-going branch. This is achieved through the
   mplsTeP2mpTunnelBranchPerfTable which is indexed by the tunnel
   identifiers and by the same identifier of the branch as is used in
   mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable.

4.7. Relationships Between MIB Tables

   This section provides a diagramatic representation of the
   relationships between MIB tables defined in this document as part of
   MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB, and the tables defined in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB in
   [RFC3812] and MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB in [RFC3813]. The dependencies
   between the various pre-existing MPLS-TE and LSR MIB tables can be
   seen in [RFC4221].

   An arrow in the figure shows that the MIB table pointed from contains
   a reference to the MIB table pointed to.

5. Using the P2MP MPLS-TE MIB Module

   This section describes how to use the P2MP MPLS-TE MIB module defined
   in this document to manage and model P2MP MPLS-TE LSPs. A subsection
   gives an example of usage.

   A P2MP MPLS-TE LSP is modeled as a single LSP tunnel. That is, there
   is a single entry in the mplsTunnelTable of the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB
   defined in [RFC3812] for each instance of a P2MP LSP tunnel. As
   described in Section 4.2, certain of the objects in an entry in the
   mplsTunnelTable are not valid or have special meanings when the entry
   is used for a P2MP LSP tunnel.

   When the MIB modules are used to configure a P2MP MPLS-TE LSP, an
   entry is first created in the mplsTunnelTable, and then corresponding
   entries are created in the mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable and the
   mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable from the MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB module
   defined in this document. The presence of a corresponding entry in
   the mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable indicates that an entry in the
   mplsTunnelTable relates to a P2MP not a P2P MPLS-TE LSP. Thus, the
   mplsTunnelAdminStatus object should not be set to up(1) until the
   entries in the mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable and the
   mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable have been completed.

5.1. Example Use of the P2MP MPLS-TE MIB Module

   This section contains an example of the use of objects in
   MPLS-TE-STD-MIB and MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB to create a P2MP MPLS-TE
   LSP. Note that the objects described should be created on the
   "head-end" LSR.

   The RowStatus values shown in this section are those to be used in
   the set request, typically createAndGo(4) which is used to create the
   conceptual row and have its status immediately set to active.  A
   subsequent retrieval operation on the conceptual row will return a
   different value, such as active(1).  Please see [RFC2579] for a
   detailed discussion on the use of RowStatus.

   Figure 2 shows the simple topology of the prospective LSP from its
   root at LSR R, through a branch node at LSR B, to its two
   destinations, LSRs D1 and D2.

   Let us assign IP addresses to the LSRs as follows:

   R   192.0.2.1
   A   192.0.2.9
   B   192.0.2.17
   C1  192.0.2.33
   C2  192.0.2.34
   D1  192.0.2.65
   D2  192.0.2.66

   Step 1 - Define the resource requirements for the LSP

     Let us assume that we require a best effort LSP.

     In mplsTunnelResourceTable define as follows:

     {
       mplsTunnelResourceIndex           = 9,
       mplsTunnelResourceMaxRate         = 0,
       mplsTunnelResourceMeanRate        = 0,
       mplsTunnelResourceMaxBurstSize    = 0,
       mplsTunnelResourceMeanBurstSize   = 0,
       mplsTunnelResourceExBurstSize     = 0,
       mplsTunnelResourceExBurstSize     = unspecified(1),
       mplsTunnelResourceWeight          = 0,
       mplsTunnelResourceRowStatus       = createAndGo(4)
     }

   Step 2 - Define the core parameters for the LSP tunnel.

     In mplsTunnelTable define as follows:

     {
       mplsTunnelIndex              = 4,
       mplsTunnelInstance           = 0,
       mplsTunnelIngressLSRId       = "192.0.2.1",

5.2.  Example Transit LSR Inspection

   The MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB module can be used at the head end of a P2MP
   LSP to configure, manage, and monitor the LSP. This is described in
   Section 5.1.

   The MIB module may also be used to monitor P2MP LSPs at transit and
   egress LSRs. Although many objects in the MIB module are writeable,
   as with MPLS-TE-STD-MIB, those objects are not normally implemented
   as writeable except at the head end LSRs.

   This section provides a simple example of the use of the P2MP MPLS-TE
   MIB module at a transit LSR where the module is used to inspect the
   LSPs. The example uses the topology shown in Figure 2 and the LSP set
   out in Section 5.1. Consider the situation at LSR B in the figure.

   LSR B will receive a single Path message from LSR A (or two separate
   Path messages depending on implementation - see [RFC4875]) and will
   send a Path message onwards to LSRs C1 and C2. Similarly, LSR B will
   receive Resv messages from LSRs C1 and C2, and will send a Resv (or
   two Resv messages according to implementation - see [RFC4875]) to LSR
   A. Once the LSP has been set up and the signaling protocol has
   reached a stable state, the tables in the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB and
   MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB can be read as follows.

   An entry in mplsTunnelTable provides the base information for the
   P2MP tunnel.

   values of the mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSubGroupID object will have been
   assigned automatically and will not have been generated by reading

6. Managing P2MP MPLS-TE LSPs Through the LSR MIB Module

   The nature of P2MP tunnels is such that an LSR that is crossed by a
   tunnel may either be the ingress of that tunnel or have precisely one
   upstream LSP segment (also known as an in-segment [RFC3812]) for that
   LSP. On the other hand, any LSR that is crossed by a tunnel may be an
   egress for that tunnel, have one or more downstream segments (also
   known as out-segments [RFC3812]) for that tunnel, or be both an
   egress and have one or more out-segments. Thus, for an LSP at an LSR
   there may be zero or one in-segments, and zero, one, or more than one
   out-segments.

   In-segments, out-segments, and their relationship through
   cross-connections are modeled and managed in the MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB
   module [RFC3813]. The mplsInSegmentTable contains in-segments, and
   the mplsOutSegmentTable contains out-segments. The mplsXCTable
   maintains the relationships between in- and out-segments such that
   any many-to-many relationship is allowed. Each segment points into
   the mplsXCTable using mplsInSegmentXCIndex and mplsOutSegmentXCIndex.

   The mplsXCTable contains a series of entries indexed by the primary
   mplsXCIndex object and subsidiary indexes mplsXCInSegmentIndex and
   mplsXCOutSegmentIndex. All cross-connect entries for the same P2MP
   LSP use the same value of mplsXCIndex, and this value is found in the
   mplsTeP2mpTunnelP2mpXcIndex object in mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable.

   A single P2MP cross-connect has zero or one in-segment. At the
   ingress LSR, there is no in-segment and mplsXCInSegmentIndex is set
   to the single octet 0x00. At transit LSRs, there is exactly one
   in-segment and mplsXCInSegmentIndex is set to the value of
   mplsInSegmentIndex for the in-segment as it appears in the
   mplsInSegmentTable.

   A single P2MP cross-connect has zero, one, or many out-segments. If


Farrel, Yasukawa, and Nadeau                                   [Page 25]

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-te-mib-08.txt         March 2009


   there is no out-segment (the cross-connect is on an egress LSR),
   there is one entry in the mplsXCTable indexed by mplsXCIndex set to
   mplsInSegmentXCIndex from the in-segment's entry in
   mplsInSegmentTable, mplsXCInSegmentIndex set to the value of
   mplsInSegmentIndex that identifies the in-segment in
   mplsInSegmentTable, and mplsXCOutSegmentIndex set to the single octet
   0x00. This behavior is exactly as described in [RFC3813].

   If there is exactly one out-segment (the cross-connect is on a
   transit LSR) then the behavior is also exactly as described in
   [RFC3813], and as well as the in-segment objects described in the
   previous paragraph, mplsXCOutSegmentIndex is set to the value of
   mplsOutSegmentIndex that identifies the out-segment in
   mplsOutSegmentTable. Note that mplsInSegmentXCIndex and
   mplsOutSegmentXCIndex from the relevant table entries will have the
   same value which will provide the value of mplsXCIndex for the
   cross-connect. This value is also found in the
   mplsTeP2mpTunnelP2mpXcIndex object in mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable.

   If there is more than one out-segment then there is one entry in
   mplsXCTable table for each out-segment. The value of mplsXCIndex is
   consistent across all of these table entries and can be found in the
   mplsTeP2mpTunnelP2mpXcIndex object in mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable. The in-
   segment index (mplsXCInSegmentIndex) is also consistent identifying
   the single in-segment or (on the ingress LSR) containing the single
   octet 0x00. Each of these mplsXCTable entries contains a different
   mplsXCOutSegmentIndex value so that the table can easily be walked to
   find all of the out-segments for the same cross-connect.

   Finally, if an LSR is an egress as well as a transit or branch for
   the P2MP LSP (we call this a bud LSR), mplsXCTable contains the
   entries described above in combination. That is, one entry will have
   mplsXCOutSegmentIndex set to the single octet 0x00, and other entries
   with the same value of mplsXCIndex and mplsXCInSegmentIndex will
   exist for each out-segment.

6.1. Example Use of the LSR MIB Module

   This section demonstrates how the objects in MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB would
   be set for an example P2MP LSP cross-connect. The information here
   does not show how and in what order these objects should be set to
   create the cross-connect, but shows what information would be read if
   the tables were examined.

   Figure 3 shows the LSP at the LSR that is being examined. There are
   three interfaces to LSR X: 10, 21 and 22. The LSP enters through
   interface 10 using label 7, and exits through interfaces 21 and 22
   using labels 8 and 9 respectively. Let us assume that LSR X is also

8. Security Considerations

   It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for the
   monitoring of P2MP MPLS TE tunnels. This MIB module can also be used
   for the configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be
   configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous
   results.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   - The mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable and mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable contain
     objects that can be used to provision P2MP MPLS tunnels, the
     destinations of those tunnels, and the hops that those tunnels take
     through the network. Unauthorized access to objects in these tables
     could result in disruption of traffic in the network. This is
     especially true if a tunnel has already been established.

     The use of stronger mechanisms, such as SNMPv3 security, should be
     considered where possible. Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST
     be used with any v3 agent which implements this MIB module.
     Administrators SHOULD also consider whether read access to these
     objects is allowed, since read access may be undesirable under
     certain circumstances as described below.

   - The use of this MIB module depends on the use of certain objects
     within MPLS-TE-STD-MIB defined in [RFC3812]. Note that those
     objects are also subject to the same security considerations, and
     any vulnerability to those objects could compromise the P2MP MPLS
     tunnels and/or data in the network. The security section of
     [RFC3812] MUST be applied in conjunction with this security
     section.

   - This MIB module does not depend on MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB, but may be
     used in conjunction with that MIB module. If MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB is
     implemented on an LSR, then access to its objects can compromise
     any P2MP MPLS tunnels that start or end on, or transit the LSR.
     MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB is defined in [RFC3813] which has its own security
     section that MUST be applied in conjunction with this security
     section if both MIB modules are supported.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or

   vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects, and possibly
   even to encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   - The mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable, mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable, and
     mplsTeP2mpTunnelBranchPerfTable collectively show information about
     the P2MP MPLS tunnel, its route through the network, and its
     performance characteristics. Knowledge of this information could be
     used to compromise the network, or simply to breach
     confidentiality. If an Administrator does not want to reveal this
     information, these tables should be considered
     sensitive/vulnerable.

   - The objects in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB also provide information about the
     P2MP MPLS tunnels defined in this MIB module. If an Administrator
     does not want to reveal this information, the security section of
     [RFC3812] should be applied.

   - The objects in MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB, if implemented, may also provide
     information about the P2MP MPLS tunnels present at an LSR,
     especially the label swapping and cross-connect operations. If an
     Administrator does not want to reveal this information, the
     security section of [RFC3813] should be applied.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is still no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED that SNMPv3 be deployed and
   cryptographic security enabled. It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   only those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to those
   objects.

9. Acknowledgments

   The authors wish to thank Tom Petch, Ben Niven-Jenkins, Markus
   Stenberg, and Subodh Kumar for their input to this work. Thanks to
   Zafar Ali for discussions. Nic Neate provided very many helpful
   suggestions.

   Joan Cucchiara provided a very thorough and helpful early MIB Doctor
   review which caught a lot of issues.

10. IANA Considerations

   As requested in MPLS-TC-STD-MIB [RFC3811], MPLS-related standards
   track MIB modules should be rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.

   There is one new MPLS MIB module contained in this document, and the
   following "IANA Considerations" subsection requests IANA for a new
   assignment under the mplsStdMIB subtree.

   New assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified
   in [RFC5226].

10.1. IANA Considerations for MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB

   IANA is requested to assign an oid under the mplsStdMIB subtree to
   the MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB module specified in this document.

-- RFC Editor. Please see the marker YYY in this document and replace it
-- with the value assigned by IANA.
-- Please remove this note.
