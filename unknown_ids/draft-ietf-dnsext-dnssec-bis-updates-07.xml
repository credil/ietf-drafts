      <t>This document is a collection of minor technical
      clarifications to the DNSSECbis document set.  It is meant to
      serve as a resource to implementors as well as an interim
      repository of DNSSECbis errata.</t>

    <section title="Introduction and Terminology">

      <t>This document lists some minor clarifications and corrections
      to DNSSECbis, as described in <xref target="RFC4033"/>, <xref target="RFC4034"/>, and <xref target="RFC4035"/>.</t>

      <t>It is intended to serve as a resource for implementors and as
      a repository of items that need to be addressed when advancing
      the DNSSECbis documents from Proposed Standard to Draft
      Standard.</t>

      <t>Proposed substantive additions to this document should be
      sent to the namedroppers mailing list as well as to the editors
      of this document.  The editors would greatly prefer
      contributions of text suitable for direct inclusion in this
      document.</t>

      <section title="Structure of this Document">

	<t>The clarifications to DNSSECbis are sorted according to the
	editors' impression of their importance, starting with ones
	which could, if ignored, lead to security and stability
	problems and progressing down to clarifications that are
	likely to have little operational impact.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Terminology">

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
        "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
        in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Significant Concerns" anchor="major">

      <t>This section provides clarifications that, if overlooked,
      could lead to security issues or major interoperability
      problems.</t>

      <section title="Clarifications on Non-Existence Proofs" anchor="nsec-bug">

	<t><xref target="RFC4035"/> Section 5.4 slightly
	underspecifies the algorithm for checking non-existence
	proofs.  In particular, the algorithm there might incorrectly
	allow the NSEC from an ancestor zone to prove the
	non-existence of other RRs at that name in the child zone or
	other names in the child zone.  It might also allow a NSEC at
	the same name as a DNAME to prove the non-existence of names
	beneath that DNAME.</t>

        <t>An ancestor delegation NSEC (one with the NS bit set, but
        no SOA bit set, and with a signer field that's shorter than
        the owner name) MUST NOT be used to assume non-existence of
        any RRs below that zone cut (both RRs at that ownername and at
        ownernames with more leading labels, no matter their content).
        Similarly, an NSEC with the DNAME bit set must not be used to
        assume the non-existence of any subdomain of that NSEC's owner
        name.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Validating Responses to an ANY Query" anchor="any-queries">

	<t><xref target="RFC4035"/> does not address how to validate
	responses when QTYPE=*.  As described in Section 6.2.2 of
	<xref target="RFC1034"/>, a proper response to QTYPE=* may
	include a subset of the RRsets at a given name -- it is not
	necessary to include all RRsets at the QNAME in the
	response.</t>

        <t>When validating a response to QTYPE=*, validate all
        received RRsets that match QNAME and QCLASS.  If any of those
        RRsets fail validation, treat the answer as Bogus.  If there
        are no RRsets matching QNAME and QCLASS, validate that fact
        using the rules in <xref target="RFC4035"/> Section 5.4 (as
        clarified in this document).  To be clear, a validator must
        not expect to receive all records at the QNAME in response to
        QTYPE=*.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Check for CNAME" anchor="check-cname">

	<t>Section 5 of <xref target="RFC4035"/> says little about
	validating responses based on (or that should be based on)
	CNAMEs.  When validating a NODATA response, it's important to
	check the CNAME bit in the NSEC bitmap.  If the CNAME bit is
	set, the validator MUST validate the CNAME RR and follow it,
	as appropriate.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Unsecure Delegation Proofs">

	<t><xref target="RFC4035"/> Section 5.2 specifies that a
	validator, when proving a delegation is unsecure, needs to
	check for the absence of the DS and SOA bits in the NSEC type
	bitmap.  The validator also needs to check for the presence of
	the NS bit in the NSEC RR (proving that there is, indeed, a
	delegation).  If this is not checked, spoofed unsigned
	delegations might be used to claim that an existing signed
	record is not signed.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Errors in Canonical Form Type Code List">

	<t>When canonicalizing DNS names, DNS names in the RDATA
	section of NSEC and RRSIG resource records are not
	downcased.</t>

	<t><xref target="RFC4034"/> Section 6.2 item 3 has a list of
	resource record types for which DNS names in the RDATA are
	downcased for purposes of DNSSEC canonical form (for both
	ordering and signing).  That list erroneously contains NSEC
	and RRSIG.  According to <xref target="RFC3755"/>, DNS names
	in the RDATA of NSEC and RRSIG should not be downcased.</t>

	<t>The same section also lists HINFO twice.  The implementor
	is encouraged to exercise good discretion and professional
	judgment when deciding whether to downcase such DNS names once
	or twice.  <xref target="RFC3597"/> contained the same error
	and, since it predated RFC3755, it doesn't mention RRSIG or
	NSEC.</t>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Interoperability Concerns" anchor="interop">

      <section title="Unknown DS Message Digest Algorithms" anchor="hash">

	<t>Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC4035"/> includes rules for
	how to handle delegations to zones that are signed with
	entirely unsupported algorithms, as indicated by the
	algorithms shown in those zone's DS RRsets.  It does not
	explicitly address how to handle DS records that use
	unsupported message digest algorithms.  In brief, DS records
	using unknown or unsupported message digest algorithms MUST be
	treated the same way as DS records referring to DNSKEY RRs of
	unknown or unsupported algorithms.</t>

        <t>The existing text says:</t>

	<t>
	  <list>
	    <t>If the validator does not support any of the algorithms
	    listed in an authenticated DS RRset, then the resolver has
	    no supported authentication path leading from the parent
	    to the child.  The resolver should treat this case as it
	    would the case of an authenticated NSEC RRset proving that
	    no DS RRset exists, as described above.</t>
	  </list>
	</t>

	<t>To paraphrase the above, when determining the security
	status of a zone, a validator discards (for this purpose only)
	any DS records listing unknown or unsupported algorithms.  If
	none are left, the zone is treated as if it were unsigned.</t>

        <t>Modified to consider DS message digest algorithms, a
        validator also discards any DS records using unknown or
        unsupported message digest algorithms.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Private Algorithms" anchor="private">

	<t>As discussed above, section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC4035"/>
        requires that validators make decisions about the security
        status of zones based on the public key algorithms shown in
        the DS records for those zones.  In the case of private
        algorithms, as described in <xref target="RFC4034"/> Appendix
        A.1.1, the eight-bit algorithm field in the DS RR is not
        conclusive about what algorithm(s) is actually in use.</t>

        <t>If no private algorithms appear in the DS set or if any
        supported algorithm appears in the DS set, no special
        processing will be needed.  In the remaining cases, the
        security status of the zone depends on whether or not the
        resolver supports any of the private algorithms in use
        (provided that these DS records use supported hash functions,
        as discussed in <xref target="hash"/>).  In these cases, the
        resolver MUST retrieve the corresponding DNSKEY for each
        private algorithm DS record and examine the public key field
        to determine the algorithm in use.  The security-aware
        resolver MUST ensure that the hash of the DNSKEY RR's owner
        name and RDATA matches the digest in the DS RR.  If they do
        not match, and no other DS establishes that the zone is
        secure, the referral should be considered BAD data, as
        discussed in <xref target="RFC4035"/>.</t>

        <t>This clarification facilitates the broader use of private
        algorithms, as suggested by <xref target="RFC4955"/>.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Caution About Local Policy and Multiple RRSIGs" anchor="multi-rrsigs">

	<t>When multiple RRSIGs cover a given RRset, <xref target="RFC4035"/> Section 5.3.3 suggests that "the local
	resolver security policy determines whether the resolver also
	has to test these RRSIG RRs and how to resolve conflicts if
	these RRSIG RRs lead to differing results."  In most cases, a
	resolver would be well advised to accept any valid RRSIG as
	sufficient.  If the first RRSIG tested fails validation, a
	resolver would be well advised to try others, giving a
	successful validation result if any can be validated and
	giving a failure only if all RRSIGs fail validation.</t>

        <t>If a resolver adopts a more restrictive policy, there's a
        danger that properly-signed data might unnecessarily fail
        validation, perhaps because of cache timing issues.
        Furthermore, certain zone management techniques, like the
        Double Signature Zone-signing Key Rollover method described in
        section 4.2.1.2 of <xref target="RFC4641"/> might not work
        reliably.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Key Tag Calculation" anchor="key-tags">

	<t><xref target="RFC4034"/> Appendix B.1 incorrectly defines
	the Key Tag field calculation for algorithm 1.  It correctly
	says that the Key Tag is the most significant 16 of the least
	significant 24 bits of the public key modulus.  However, <xref target="RFC4034"/> then goes on to incorrectly say that this
	is 4th to last and 3rd to last octets of the public key
	modulus.  It is, in fact, the 3rd to last and 2nd to last
	octets.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Setting the DO Bit on Replies" anchor="clear-do-bit">

	<t><xref target="RFC4035"/> does not provide any instructions
	to servers as to how to set the DO bit.  Some authoritative
	server implementations have chosen to copy the DO bit settings
	from the incoming query to the outgoing response.  Others have
	chosen to never set the DO bit in responses.  Either behavior
	is permitted.  To be clear, in replies to queries with the
	DO-bit set servers may or may not set the DO bit.</t>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Minor Corrections and Clarifications" anchor="minor">

      <section title="Finding Zone Cuts" anchor="grandparent">

	<t>Appendix C.8 of <xref target="RFC4035"/> discusses sending
	DS queries to the servers for a parent zone.  To do that, a
	resolver may first need to apply special rules to discover
	what those servers are.</t>

	<t>As explained in Section 3.1.4.1 of <xref target="RFC4035"/>, security-aware name servers need to apply
	special processing rules to handle the DS RR, and in some
	situations the resolver may also need to apply special rules
	to locate the name servers for the parent zone if the resolver
	does not already have the parent's NS RRset.  Section 4.2 of
	<xref target="RFC4035"/> specifies a mechanism for doing
	that.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Clarifications on DNSKEY Usage" anchor="keys">

	<t>Questions of the form "can I use a different DNSKEY for
	signing this RRset" have occasionally arisen.</t>

	<t>The short answer is "yes, absolutely".  You can even use a
	different DNSKEY for each RRset in a zone, subject only to
	practical limits on the size of the DNSKEY RRset.  However, be
	aware that there is no way to tell resolvers what a
	particularly DNSKEY is supposed to be used for -- any DNSKEY
	in the zone's signed DNSKEY RRset may be used to authenticate
	any RRset in the zone.  For example, if a weaker or less
	trusted DNSKEY is being used to authenticate NSEC RRsets or
	all dynamically updated records, that same DNSKEY can also be
	used to sign any other RRsets from the zone.</t>

        <t>Furthermore, note that the SEP bit setting has no effect on
        how a DNSKEY may be used -- the validation process is
        specifically prohibited from using that bit by <xref target="RFC4034"/> section 2.1.2.  It is possible to use a
        DNSKEY without the SEP bit set as the sole secure entry point
        to the zone, yet use a DNSKEY with the SEP bit set to sign all
        RRsets in the zone (other than the DNSKEY RRset).  It's also
        possible to use a single DNSKEY, with or without the SEP bit
        set, to sign the entire zone, including the DNSKEY RRset
        itself.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Errors in Examples" anchor="examples-nits">

        <t>The text in <xref target="RFC4035"/> Section C.1 refers to
        the examples in B.1 as "x.w.example.com" while B.1 uses
        "x.w.example".  This is painfully obvious in the second
        paragraph where it states that the RRSIG labels field value of
        3 indicates that the answer was not the result of wildcard
        expansion.  This is true for "x.w.example" but not for
        "x.w.example.com", which of course has a label count of 4
        (antithetically, a label count of 3 would imply the answer was
        the result of a wildcard expansion).</t>

        <t>The first paragraph of <xref target="RFC4035"/> Section C.6
        also has a minor error: the reference to "a.z.w.w.example"
        should instead be "a.z.w.example", as in the previous
        line.</t>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">

      <t>This document specifies no IANA Actions.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">

      <t>This document does not make fundamental changes to the DNSSEC
      protocol, as it was generally understood when DNSSECbis was
      published.  It does, however, address some ambiguities and
      omissions in those documents that, if not recognized and
      addressed in implementations, could lead to security failures.
      In particular, the validation algorithm clarifications in <xref target="major"/> are critical for preserving the security
      properties DNSSEC offers.  Furthermore, failure to address some
      of the interoperability concerns in <xref target="interop"/>
      could limit the ability to later change or expand DNSSEC,
      including by adding new algorithms.</t>

      <t>This document describes a set of practices for operating the DNS with security extensions (DNSSEC). The target audience is zone administrators deploying DNSSEC. The document discusses operational aspects of using keys and signatures in the DNS. It discusses issues of key generation, key storage, signature generation, key rollover, and related policies. This document obsoletes RFC 2541, as it covers more operational ground and gives more up-to-date requirements with respect to key sizes and the new DNSSEC specification. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>As the DNS Security (DNSSEC) specifications have evolved, the syntax and semantics of the DNSSEC resource records (RRs) have changed.  Many deployed nameservers understand variants of these semantics.  Dangerous interactions can occur when a resolver that understands an earlier version of these semantics queries an authoritative server that understands the new delegation signer semantics, including at least one failure scenario that will cause an unsecured zone to be unresolvable.  This document changes the type codes and mnemonics of the DNSSEC RRs (SIG, KEY, and NXT) to avoid those interactions. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t>
