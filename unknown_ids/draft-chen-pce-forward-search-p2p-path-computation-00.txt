1.  Introduction

   Methods or procedures exist for computing MPLS TE P2P LSP inter-
   domain paths.  They include RFC 5152 "A Per-Domain Path Computation
   Method for Establishing Inter-Domain Traffic Engineering (TE) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs)" and RFC 5441 "A Backward-Recursive PCE-Based
   Computation (BRPC) Procedure to Compute Shortest Constrained Inter-
   Domain Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths".  These methods or
   procedures have some issues.

   There are a few of issues with the Backward Recursive Path
   Computation (BRPC) algorithm or procedure for computing an MPLS TE
   P2P LSP path from a source node to a destination node crossing
   multiple domains.  These issues include:

   The sequence of domains from the source node to the destination node
   must be known in advance.

   Navigating a mesh of domains may be complex.

   More importantly, the BRPC procedure can not find the optimal path if
   the optimal path is not in the sequence of domains from the source
   node to the destination node.  Thus the BRPC procedure can not
   guarantee that the path crossing multiple domains computed by the
   BRPC procedure is optimal.

   This document presents a forward search procedure for computing
   Point-to-Point (P2P) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs) crossing a number of domains through using multiple Path
   Computation Elements (PCEs).  This procedure resolves the issues
   mentioned above.  It guarantees that the path found from the source
   to the destination is optimal.  It does not depend on any sequence of
   domains from the source node to the destination node.  Navigating a
   mesh of domains is simple and efficient.

4.  Forward Search Path Computation

   This section gives an overview of the forward search path computation
   procedure and describes the procedure in details.

4.1.  Overview of Procedure

   Simply speaking, the idea of the forward search path computation
   procedure for computing a path for an MPLS TE P2P LSP crossing
   multiple domains from a source node to a destination node includes:

   Start from the source node and the source domain.

Internet-Draft           Forward Search P2P Path              March 2011


   Consider the optimal path segment from the source node to every exit
   boundary node of the source domain as a special link;

   Consider the optimal path segment from an entry boundary node to
   every exit boundary node of a domain as a special link; and the
   optimal path segment is computed as needed.

   The whole topology consisting of many domains can be considered as a
   special topology, which contains those special links, the normal
   links in the destination domain and the inter-domain links.

   Compute an optimal path in this special topology from the source node
   to the destination node using CSPF.

   The forward search path computation procedure for computing a path
   for an MPLS TE P2P LSP starts at the source domain, in which the
   source (or ingress) node of the MPLS TE LSP locates.  When a PCE in
   the source domain receives a PCReq for the path for the MPLS TE LSP,
   it computes the optimal path from the source node to every exit
   boundary node of the domain towards the destination node.

   There are two lists involved in the path computation.  One list is
   called candidate node list, which contains the nodes with brief
   information about the temporary optimal paths from the source node to
   each of these nodes currently found.  The nodes in the candidate list
   are ordered by the cost of the path.  Initially, the candidate node
   list contains only source node with cost 0.

   The other is called result path list or tree, which contains the
   final optimal paths from the source node to the boundary nodes or the
   nodes in the destination domain.  Initially, the result path list is
   empty.

   When a PCE responsible for a domain (called current domain) receives
   a PCReq for computing the path for the MPLS TE LSP, it removes the
   node with the minimum cost from the candidate node list and put or
   graft the node to the result path list or tree.

   If the destination node is in the current domain, the PCE computes
   the optimal path from the source node to the destination node and
   sends a PCRep with the optimal path to the PCE or PCC from which the
   PCReq is received.

   Otherwise (i.e., if the destination is not in the domain), the PCE
   computes the optimal path from the source node to every exit boundary
   node of the current domain towards the destination node and further
   to the entry boundary nodes of the domain connected to the current
   domain, puts the new node into the candidate list in order by path

   cost, updates the existing node in the candidate node list with the
   new node with lower cost, and then sends a PCReq with the new
   candidate node list to the PCE that is responsible for the domain
   with the first node in the candidate node list.

4.2.  Description of Procedure

   Suppose that we have the following variables:

   A current PCE named as CurrentPCE which is currently computing the
   path.

   A candidate node list named as CandidateNodeList, which contains the
   nodes to each of which the temporary optimal path from the source
   node is currently found.  The information about each node C in
   CandidateNodeList consists of

   the cost of the path from the source node to node C,

   the previous hop node P and the link between P and C,

   the PCE responsible for C, and

   the flags for C. The flags include

   one bit D indicating that node C is a Destination node if it is set;

   one bit S indicating that C is the Source node if it is set;

   one bit E indicating that C is an Exit boundary node if it is set;

   one bit I indicating that C is an entry boundary node if it is set;
   and

   one bit N indicating that C is a Node in the destination domain if it
   is set.

   The nodes in CandidateNodeList are ordered by path cost.  Initially,
   CandidateNodeList contains only a Source Node, with path cost 0, PCE
   responsible for the source domain, and flags with S bit set.

   A result path list or tree named as ResultPathTree, which contains
   the final optimal paths from the source node to the boundary nodes or
   the nodes in the destination domain.  Initially, ResultPathTree is
   empty.

   The Forward Search Path Computation procedure for computing the path
   for the MPLS TE P2P LSP is described as follows:



Chen                    Expires September 8, 2011               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           Forward Search P2P Path              March 2011


   Initially, a PCC sets ResultPathTree to empty and CandidateNodeList
   to contain the source node and sends PCE responsible for the source
   domain a PCReq with the source node, the destination node,
   CandidateNodeList and ResultPathTree.

   When the PCE responsible for a domain (called current domain)
   receives a request for computing the path for the MPLS TE P2MP LSP,
   it checks whether the current PCE is the PCE responsible for the node
   C with the minimum cost in the CandidateNodeList.  If it is, then
   remove C from CandidateNodeList and graft it into ResultPathTree;
   otherwise, a PCReq message is sent to the PCE for node C.

   Suppose that node C has Flags.  The ResultPathTree is built from C in
   the following steps.

   If the D (Destination Node) bit in the Flags is set, then the optimal
   path from the source node to the destination node is found, and a
   PCRep message with the path is sent to the PCE/PCC which sends the
   request to the current PCE.

   If the N (Node in Destination domain) bit in the Flags is set, then
   for every node N connected to node C and not on ResultPathTree, it is
   merged into CandidateNodeList.  The cost to node N is the sum of the
   cost to node C and the cost of the link between C and N. The PCE for
   node N is the current PCE.

   If the Entry/Incoming Boundary Node (I) bit or the Source Node (S)
   bit is set), then path segments from node C to every exit boundary
   node of the current domain that is not on the result path tree are
   computed through using CSPF and as special links.  For every node N
   connected to node C through a special link (i.e., a path segment), it
   is merged into CandidateNodeList.  The cost to node N is the sum of
   the cost to node C and the cost of the special link (i.e., path
   segment ) between C and N. The PCE for node N is the current PCE.

   If the Exit Boundary Node (E) bit is set and there exist inter-domain
   links connected to it, then for every node N connected to C and not
   on the result path tree, it is merged into the candidate node list.
   The cost to node N is the sum of the cost to node C and the cost of
   the link between C and N. The PCE for node N is the PCE responsible
   for node N.

   If the CurrentPCE is the same as the PCE of the node with the minimum
   cost in CandidateNodeList, then the node is removed from
   CandidateNodeList, grafted to ResultPathTree, and the above steps are
   repeated; otherwise, the CurrentPCE sends the PCE a request with the
   source node, CandidateNodeList and ResultPathTree.

5.  Extensions to PCEP

   This section describes the extensions to PCEP for Forward Search Path
   Computation.  The extensions include the definition of a new flag in
   the RP object, a result path list and a candidate node list in the
   PCReq message.

5.1.  RP Object Extension

   The following flag is added into the RP Object:

   The F bit is added in the flag bits field of the RP object to tell
   the receiver of the message that the request/reply is for Forward
   Search Path Computation.

       o F (Forward search Path Computation bit - 1 bit):

           0: This indicates that this is not PCReq/PCRep
              for Forward Search Path Computation.

           1: This indicates that this is PCReq or PCRep message
              for Forward Search Path Computation.


   The IANA request is referenced in Section below (Request Parameter
   Bit Flags) of this document.

   This F bit with the N bit defined in RFC6006 can indicate whether the
   request/reply is for Forward Search Path Computation of an MPLS TE
   P2P LSP or an MPLS TE P2MP LSP.

       o F = 1 and N = 0: This indicates that this is a PCReq/PCRep
                          message for Forward Search Path Computation
                          of an MPLS TE P2P LSP.

       o F = 1 and N = 1: This indicates that this is a PCReq/PCRep
                          message for Forward Search Path Computation
                          of an MPLS TE P2MP LSP.


5.2.  PCE Object

   The figure below illustrates a PCE IPv4 object body (Object-Type=2),
   which comprises a PCE IPv4 address.  The PCE IPv4 address object
   indicates the IPv4 address of a PCE , with which a PCE session may be
   established and to which a request message may be sent.

5.3.  Node Flags Object

   The Node Flags object is used to indicate the characteristics of the
   node in a candidate node list in a request or reply message for
   Forward Search Inter-domain Path Computation.  The Node Flags object
   comprises a Reserved field, and a number of Flags.

   The format of the Node Flags object body is as follows:


       0                   1                   2                   3

         <candidate-node>::= <ERO>

         <candidate-attribute-list>::= [<attribute-list>]

   The ERO in a candidate node contain just the path segment of the last
   link of the path, which is from the previous hop node of the tail end
   node of the path to the tail end node.  With this information, we can
   graft the candidate node into the existing result path list or tree.

   Simply speaking, a candidate node has the same or similar format of a
   path defined in RFC 5440, but the ERO in the candidate node just
   contain the tail end node of the path and its previous hop, and the
   candidate path may contain two new objects PCE and node flags.

5.5.  Request Message Extension

   Below is the message format for a request message with the extension
   of a result path list and a candidate node list:

                Figure 1: The Format for a Request Message

   The definition for the result path list that may be added into a
   request message is the same as that for the path list in a reply
   message that is described in RFC5440.


6.  Security  Considerations

   The mechanism described in this document does not raise any new
   security issues for the PCEP protocols.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This section specifies requests for IANA allocation.

7.1.  Request Parameter Bit Flags

   A new RP Object Flag has been defined in this document.  IANA is
   requested to make the following allocation from the "PCEP RP Object
