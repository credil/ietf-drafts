  RBridges: Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Support
                    draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-oam-00

Abstract

   The IETF has standardized RBridges, devices that implement the TRILL
   protocol, a solution for transparent least-cost frame routing in
   multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies, using a link-state
   routing protocol technology and encapsulation with a hop-count.  As
   RBridges are deployed in real-world situations, operators will need
   tools for debugging problems that arise.  This document specifies a
   set of RBridge features for operations, administration, and
   maintenance (OAM) purposes in RBridge campuses.  The features
   specified in this document include tools for traceroute, ping, and
   error reporting.

Internet-Draft            RBridges: OAM Support                July 2011


1.  Introduction

   The IETF has standardized RBridges, devices that implement the TRILL
   protocol, a solution for transparent least-cost frame routing in
   multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies, using a link-state
   routing protocol technology and encapsulation with a hop-count
   [RFCtrill].  As RBridges are deployed, operators will face problems
   that require tools for troubleshooting of connectivity issues in the
   network.  TRILL uses IS-IS for the control plane [IS-IS] [RFC6165]
   [RFCtisis].  IS-IS has a link-state database which contains the
   information of all links in the TRILL domain and IS-IS has a routing
   table.  This information can be used for trouble shooting purposes.

   In addition, RBridges should support SNMP, as described in [RFCtrill]
   and [RBridgeMIB].  SNMP, the routing table, and the link-state
   database are insufficient as the only OAM tools because while the
   control plane within an RBridge campus may be functioning
   successfully the data plane may not be.  This motivates the need for
   OAM tools that allow an operator to test the data plane.  Protocols
   such as IP, MPLS, and IEEE 802.1 have features enabling an operator
   to exercise the data plane [RFC4443] [RFC0792] [IEEE.802-1ag].  There
   is a need for a similar set of tools in TRILL.

   Likewise, there is a need for error reporting capabilities inside an
   RBridge campus.  For instance, if a TRILL Inner.VLAN tag has an
   illegal value there should be a way for devices to report this error.
   This would asist administrators of an RBridge campus in quickly
   locating a problem device in the network.

   This document specifies a set of RBridge features for operations,
   administration, and maintenance purposes in RBridge campuses along
   with a frame format.  The features specified in this document include
   tools for traceroute, ping, and error reporting.  Section 3 of this
   document specifies the general usage of a defined message format.
   Section 4 specifies some additional applications of the message
   format.  Section 5 specifies the format of the messages on the wire.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  TRILL OAM Message

   To facilitate message passing as needed by the OAM requirements, the
   TRILL RBridge Channel facility [RBridgeChannel] is utilized.

   There are two types of TRILL OAM messages defined in this document
   carried within an RBridge Channel: application and error
   notification.  Frames with an error notification MUST NOT be
   generated in response to frames that are an error notification.
   Implementations SHOULD rate limit the origination of error
   notifications.  Whereas unknown unicast frames are sent as multi-
   destination messages, sending unknown unicast frames with an error
   can lead to an amplification attack.  As such special care and rate
   limiting are necessary for error notifications.

   The specification of rate limiting is beyond the scope of this
   document.  An RBridge SHOULD maintain counters for each type of error
   generated.

   Error notification messages contain the error-causing frame or the
   initial part thereof after its OAM message.  The following are two
   figures showing application and error notification message structure.
   Section 5 goes into the details of these formats.

   in response to some other frame, might be lost.

4.  RBridge Tools

   This section specifies a number of RBridge OAM tools.  For
   classification purposes they are divided into two sections,
   applications and error tools.

4.1.  Application RBridge Tools

4.1.1.  Hop Count Traceroute

   The ability to trace the path the data takes through the network is
   an invaluable debugging tool.  RBridge traceroute provides this
   functionality through use of the TRILL OAM message (See Section 3).
   In a hop-count traceroute, the originating RBridge starts by
   transmitting one TRILL data frame with a TRILL OAM message.  This
   message contains a protocol code of an echo request.  (See
   Section 6.1.1) The ingress RBridge MUST be the RBridge originating
   the frame.

   When a traceroute is initiated, it is either targeting a known
   unicast target or a multi-destination target as specified by the
   operator.  If the hop-count traceroute is for a known unicast target,
   the egress RBridge is the destination RBridge to which connectivity
   will be checked and the M bit MUST be zero.  Otherwise, if the hop-
   count traceroute is for a multi-destination target, the egress
   RBridge is the distribution tree nickname for the traceroute.  Multi-
   destination targets are handled the same as known unicast targets but
   require a small amount of additional logic as specified in
   Section 4.1.1.1.

   The first echo request frame transmitted MUST have a hop-count of
   one.  The RBridge will continue transmitting these echo requests,
   incrementing the hop-count by one each time until a hop-count error
   notification or echo reply is received from the destination.  Each of
   these requests in turn will generate a hop-count error notification
   until the egress RBridge is reached.  If a transit RBridge decrements
   the hop-count by more than one it may transmit multiple hop-count
   error notifications.

   The purpose of the traceroute is to confirm connectivity of the data
   plane, and therefore options defined in future drafts MAY be
   included.  The purpose of allowing the addition of options is so that
   the frame mimics a data frame that follows the same path through the
   data plane that a 'real' data frame would.

   The echo request MAY have an arbitrary 28-bit unsigned integer

   sequence number to assist in matching reply messages to the request.
   This is important for the hop-count traceroute since replies may
   return to the ingress RBridge in a different order then their
   matching requests were sent.

   The Inner.VLAN, Inner.MacSA, Inner.MacDA, Inner.Priority, and Ingress
   Nickname SHOULD default to the values specified in Table 1.  RBridges
   SHOULD be configurable to change these values to assign the TRILL
   data frame to a flow.

   The replying RBridge MUST include its 16-bit port ID from the port on
   which the hop-count error generating frame was received in the
   incoming port field of the reply.  It MUST also include its 16-bit
   port ID from the port on which the frame would be forwarded if the
   frame did not have a hop-count error.  A port ID of 0xFFFF indicates
   the frame would not have been forwarded and would be consumed by the
   RBridge itself.  Finally the reply MUST include a 16-bit nickname of
   the next hop RBridge the frame would have been sent to if there were
   no error.  If the request is a multi-destination frame, this field
   MUST be set to the nickname of the RBridge the frame was received
   from.  This is the previous hop RBridge.  This is to facilitate
   knowledge of a more precise path through the campus as seen in RFC
   5837 [RFC5837].

   The advantage of this traceroute method is that the transit RBridges
   do not have to do any special processing of the frames until a hop-
   count error is detected, a condition they are required to detect by
   the TRILL base protocol.  The disadvantage is the request-orginating
   RBridge needs to transmit as many frames as there are hops between
   itself and the destination RBridge.

   The end stations are not involved in this process.  RBridge
   traceroutes are from RBridge to RBridge.  While the frames sent may
   emulate data sent from ESa to ESb, the end stations are not, in fact,
   involved.

4.1.1.1.  Multi-Destination Targets

   For multi-destination targets at each branch in the tree the tagged
   frame will be replicated causing each RBridge in the tree, possibly
   pruned by VLAN and/or IP multicast group, to send a response to the
   echo request.  If all RBridges in the possibly pruned distribution
   tree support the echo request message, then the ingressing RBridge
   will receive an error notification from each of them.  The ingressing
   RBridge can compile all of these notifications, using the parent
   pointers located in the nexthop nickname field, into an output of the
   tree the traffic traversed.  A traceroute application SHOULD report
   any errors received, such as an invalid distribution tree nickname,

   caused by the hop-count traceroute frames.  RBridges receiving a
   multicast destination echo request MUST NOT transmit an echo reply if
   the multi-destination bit is set.  Echo requests that are not used
   with the hop-count traceroute come from the ping tool, and ping
   messages are not valid as multi-destination traffic.  In a hop count
   traceroute, devices will already be transmitting a hop-count error
   notification and so there is no reason to transmit a double set of
   replies.  A multi-destination hop-count traceroute SHOULD not stop
   when an echo reply is received.  It stops when the transmitted hop
   count reaches the maximum, 0x3F.

4.1.1.2.  Hop Count Traceroute Example

   Figure 3 contains a campus with three RBridges.  Consider a hop-count
   traceroute from RB0 to RB2.

                                 Figure 3

   In this diagram RB0 transmits frame (1) destined to RB2.  This frame
   contains the echo request message and a hop-count of 1.  When RB1
   receives this frame it drops it and transmits a hop-count-exceeded
   message, (2), to RB0.  RB0 then transmits a frame, (3), with a hop-
   count of 2.  RB1 decrements this hop-count by 1 to 1 and forwards it
   to RB2.  RB2 drops frame (3) and transmits a hop-count-exceeded
   message, (4), to RB0.  The traceroute is now complete.

   Below are some select fields for the frames:

4.1.2.  RBridge Ping

   Ping is a tool for verifying RBridge connectivity.  As with an
   RBridge traceroute, the ping-originating RBridge transmits one or
   more TRILL data frames with a TRILL OAM message.  This message

Internet-Draft            RBridges: OAM Support                July 2011


   contains the code of an echo request (See Section 6.1.1).  The
   ingress RBridge MUST be the frame-originating RBridge.  The egress
   RBridge is the destination RBridge to which connectivity will be
   checked.  The M bit MUST be zero.

   The purpose of the ping is to confirm connectivity of the data plane,
   and therefore options defined in future drafts MAY be included.  The
   purpose of allowing the addition of options is so that the frame
   mimics a data frame that follows the same path through the data plane
   that a 'real' data frame would.

   The echo request MAY have an arbitrary 28-bit unsigned integer
   sequence number to assist in matching reply messages to the request.
   In most circumstances, a single echo request is needed to complete
   the ping but it might be desirable for a single RBridge to ping
   multiple egress RBridges, or trace differing flows simultaneously.
   Assigning differing sequence numbers to each frame aids in matching
   which trace the reply belongs to.

   The Inner.VLAN, Inner.MacSA, Inner.MacDA, Inner.Priority, and Ingress
   Nickname SHOULD default to the values specified in Table 1.  RBridges
   SHOULD provide the ability to change these values so as to assign the
   TRILL data frame to a flow.  The payload of the frame is arbitrary
   and MAY contain any value.  This value can have an influence on which
   flow the frame is assigned to.

   RBridges implementing ping SHOULD issue a reply in response to this
   request.  See Section 10 for reasons that RBridges are allowed to
   choose not to respond to a request.  If an RBridge chooses to respond
   to the request, the reply MUST consist of one TRILL data frame per
   request with an OAM message containing the protocol code of an echo
   reply.  The echo reply MUST have the same sequence number as the
   request being matched.

   For the echo reply the ingress RBridge field MUST be the reply-
   originating RBridge's nickname.  The egress RBridge MUST be the
   request-originating RBridge's nickname.  The Inner.VLAN, Inner.MacSA,
   and Inner.MacDA SHOULD default to the values specified in Table 1.
   The M bit MUST be zero.

   The reply-originating RBridge MUST include its 16-bit port ID from
   the port on which the request was received in the incoming port field
   of the reply.  It MUST also include its 16-bit port ID from the port
   on which the frame is forwarded.  A port ID of 0xFFFF indicates the
   frame would not have been forwarder and was consumed by the RBridge
   itself.  The nickname field in the generated frame MUST be set to all
   zeros on transmission and ignored on reception.

   The reply frame need not follow the same path though the campus as
   the request.  The reply messages are not meant to test the data
   plane.

   End stations are not involved in this the ping process.  RBridge
   pings are from RBridge to RBridge.  While the frames sent may emulate
   data sent from ESa to ESb, the end stations are not, in fact,
   involved.

   The transmitting RBridge MUST wait for a reply frame until a time-out
   occurs.  At that time, the RBridge SHOULD assume the frame was lost,
   and this SHOULD be indicated to the operator.  The length of this
   time-out beyond the scope of this document.

   In this diagram RB0 transmits frame (1) destined to RB2.  This frame
   contains the echo request message.  When RB1 receives this frame it
   forwards it to RB2.  When RB2 receives this frame it transmits and

   forwards it to RB0.

                       Table 4: Ping Example Frames

   For example, if the nicknames for RB0, RB1, and RB2 are 0x1111,
   0x2222, and 0x3333 respectively, the console output from such a ping
   might be:

   Pinging
   --------------------------------------------
   ... from 0x1111 to 0x3333... 0x3333 is alive
   ... from 0x1111 to 0x3333... 0x3333 is alive
   ... from 0x1111 to 0x3333... 0x3333 is alive

   In this example, the ping was repeated three times with the sequence
   number (not shown) being changed each time.

4.2.  Error Reporting

   Errors can occur in received TRILL data frames.  For this purpose,
   the error notification format is specified.  These are generated due
   to various events as specified subsequently.  When a TRILL data frame
   is received with an error, an error notification frame SHOULD be
   generated.  See Section 10 for reasons some RBridges are allowed to
   choose not to respond to a request.  The generated reply MUST contain
   the error notification.  The sub-code MUST contain a code specifying
   the error encountered.  The valid sub-code values are specified in
   Section 6.2.1.  Two of these sub-codes provide for TLVs with
   additional information.  The error notification also contains a 3 bit
   error type field which describes the error.

   This frame has a TRILL header and it contains, as its payload, the
   frame received with the error.  If the size of the received frame
   would cause the generated frame to exceed 1470 bytes, the frame MUST
   be truncated to the 1470 bytes.  The payload MUST include the TRILL
   header of the received frame and MUST NOT include the link-layer
   header.  The generated reply MUST contain the error notification
   message specific to the error.

Internet-Draft            RBridges: OAM Support                July 2011


   When the original ingress RBridge receives the error frame, at a
   minimum, the RBridge SHOULD update a counter specifying the number of
   error frames received for the causing error.  The encapsulated frame
   MUST NOT be egressed.  Each RBridge SHOULD also keep a set of
   counters for errors reported by other RBridges.

   The two sub-codes that provide for TLVs with additional information
   are described below.  All other sub-codes specified in this document
   do not contain TLVs.

4.2.1.  Hop Count Zero Error

   When a TRILL data frame is received with a hop-count of zero, an
   error notification frame MUST be generated unless rate limiting or
   some particular difficulty, as described below stops the sending of
   such an error notification.  The generated reply MUST contain the
   hop-count zero error sub-code.  If the received frame has the echo
   request message, the hop-count zero error notification MUST have a
   sequence number matching the echo request.  Otherwise, the sequence
   number MUST be set to zero.  The incoming port ID MUST be the port ID
   the received frame arrived on.  The outgoing port ID MUST be the port
   ID of the port the received frame would have been forwarded onto if
   the hop-count was not zero.  Finally, the error notification MUST
   include a 16-bit nickname of the next hop RBridge the frame would
   have been sent to.  If the request is a multi-destination frame, this
   field MUST be set to all zeros on transmission and ignored on
   reception.  If the RBridge transmitting the request is the egress
   RBridge, this field MUST be set to 0x0000.

4.2.2.  MTU Error

   When a TRILL data frame is received with a payload that would exceed
   the MTU of the port the frame would otherwise be forwarded to, an
   error notification frame MAY be generated.  The generated reply MUST
   contain the MTU error sub-code.  The outgoing port MTU field MUST
   have the MTU of the port the frame would have otherwise been
   transmitted on.  The incoming port ID MUST be the port ID the
   received frame arrived on.  The outgoing port ID MUST be the port ID
   of the port the received frame would have been forwarded onto if the
   frame size was not too large.  Finally, the error notification
   message MUST include a 16-bit nickname of the next hop RBridge the
   frame would have been sent to.  If this is a multi-destination frame
   this field MUST be set to all zeros on transmission and ignored on
   reception.  If the RBridge transmitting the request is the egress
   RBridge, this field MUST be set to 0x0000.

5.  RBridge Channel Message Format

   This section specifies the format of the TRILL OAM payload after the
   RBridge Channel header and values of the fields in the RBridge
   Channel Header [RBridgeChannel].

5.1.  RBridge Channel Header and Sequence Number

   The RBridge Channel Header [RBridgeChannel] fields and flags and
   following sequence number are as follows:

   o  CHV (Channel Header Version) is zero.

   o  Protocol code values are:

      *  0x004 (Suggested): Echo

      *  0x005 (Suggested): Error Notification

   o  Flags: The SL and NA bits SHOULD be zero, the MH bit SHOULD be one

   o  ERR: The ERR field MUST be zero.

   o  Sequence Number: For the Echo and Error Notification protocols,
      the RBridge Channel Header is always followed by a nibble sub-
      protocol identifier (SPID) and a 28-bit Sequence Number.  This 28-
      bit field is used to sequence or match frames for certain uses.
      The SPID is used to provide additional op-code room for a protocol
      to further multiplex its messages.  Not all TRILL OAM messages
      utilize the sequence number field or the SPID.

6.  OAM Protocol Formats

   The formats of Echo Request, Echo Reply, and Error Notification OAM
   Messages are given below.

   This message is used by RBridges to signal that an error has been
   detected.

   o  SPID: The SPID MUST be set to all zeros on transmission and is
      ignored on reception.  It is unused by the error notification
      protocol.

   o  Sequence Number: For all sub-codes except for the hop count error
      this field is unused.  It is set to zero on transmission and
      ignored on reception.  For the hop count error this is a 28-bit
      unsigned integer used to aid in matching reply messages to echo
      requests requests.  If the frame whose hop-count dropped to zero

      contains the echo request message (See Section 6.1.1), this MUST
      match the sequence number Echo Request found in that message.  If
      this is not in reply to an Echo Request, then the sequence number
      MUST be set to zero.

   o  Error Type: MUST be a specifier of the error type describing the
      error.  The values are: 0 (Permanent Error), 1 (Transient Error),
      2 (Warning), 3 (Comment).  Values 4 through 7 are available for
      allocation by IETF Review.

   o  Subcode: MUST be a specifier of the error discovered in the frame.
      The valid values are specified in Section 6.2.1

   o  TLVs: A set of type, length, value encoded fields as specified in
      Section 7.  For next hop errors the next hop nickname, outgoing
      port ID, and incoming port ID TLVs MUST be present.  For MTU
      errors the outgoing port MTU, next hop nickname, outgoing port ID,
      and incoming port ID TLVs MUST be present.  For all other errors
      the TLVs are not used by default and the length of this section is
      set to zero.  An RBridge MAY include additional TLVs on any error
      however.

6.2.1.  Error Specifiers

   The sub-code values fall into three categories: errors, warnings, and
   comments.  All sub-codes represent something out of the ordinary that
   has gone wrong, but certain ones are more important than others.
   Sub-codes that are classified as errors are the most severe with
   warning sub-codes being less severe.  These are enabled by default.
   Sub-codes classified as comments are minor and are disabled by
   default.  They may be useful for operators debugging a network.  All
   error generations are optional and therefore MAY be generated or not
   generated depending on security and implementation constraints.

   The error specifiers sub-code values are:

   Error Sub-codes

   o  0: Unknown Error: Indicates an error has occurred.

   o  1: Corrupt Frame: Frame received with invalid FCS or that was not
      an 8-bit multiple in length.  It could be impossible for a device
      to signal this if the low-level port hardware hides this from the
      software.

   o  2: Invalid Outer.MacDA: Indicates the MAC Address is a multicast
      address and the M bit is zero, the MAC Address is not a multicast

      This may occur if devices are configured to explicitly register
      end stations and an unknown Inner.MacDA occurs in a unicast TRILL
      data frame.  This also only applies at egress and could indicate
      that the Inner.MacDA was a learned address that has timed out.

   o  173: Unknown Inner.MacSA: Indicates the Inner.MacSA is unknown.
      This may occur if devices are configured to explicitly register

7.  Type, Length, Value (TLV) Encodings

   To facilitate future interoperable expansion of the data carried in
   OAM sub-messages some sub-messages use a TLV encoding.  These TLV
   sections consist of a list of type, length, value encoded data where
   the type signals to the RBridge how to interpret the value, and the
   length tells the RBridge the length of the value in bytes.  The type
   and length are both 8 bit fields.  A length of zero indicates the
   value is a UTF-8 string with a NULL ('\0') terminating byte.
   Preceding the list of TLVs is a 16 bit total length field which
   specifies the total length of all the length fields in octet units.
   TLVs with an unknown Type may be ignored and skipped over.

   with initial values as listed in Section 5.3.  Additional values are
   allocated by IETF Review [RFC5226].

   This draft also requires action to reserve the TRILL RBridge Channel
   protocol codes.  IANA is requested to allocate the TRILL RBridge
   Channel protocol codes for as listed in Section 5.1.

10.  Security Considerations

   The nature of the OAM Messages can lead to security concerns.  By
   providing information about the topology and status of a network,
   attackers can gain greater knowledge of a network in order to exploit

   the network.  Passive attacks such as reading frames with an OAM
   message could be used to gain such knowledge or active attacks where
   an attacker mimics an RBridge can be used to probe the network.
   Authentication, data integrity, protection against replay attacks,
   and confidentiality for TRILL OAM frames may be provided using a to-
   be-specified TRILL Security Option.  Using such a security option
   would mitigate both the passive and active attacks.

   For instance, data origin authentication could be provided in the
   future using a security options in the TRILL Header by verifying a
   hash using shared keys or a mechanism like SEND with CGA.  To prevent
   replay attacks rate limiting, sequence numbers as well as some nonce
   based mechanism could be provided.  Confidentiality for TRILL OAM
   frames could be provided based on some future security option
   extension which encypts TRILL frames.

   In a network where one does not wish to configure a security option,
   the threat of attackers is still present.  For this reason,
   generation of any TRILL OAM Message frames is optional and SHOULD be
   configurable by an operator on a per RBridge basis.  An RBridge MAY
   have this configurable on a per port basis.  For instance, an
   operator SHOULD be able to disable hop-count traceroute reply
   messages or error notification message generation per port.

   Another security threat is denial of service through use of OAM
   messages.  For this reason, RBridges MUST rate limit the generation
   of OAM message frames.  For multi-destination frames, the frames MAY
   be discarded silently to prevent any denial of service attacks in
   case of an errored packet such as an 'options not recognized' error
   notification.
