Abstract

   The flexible authentication via secure tunneling EAP method (EAP-
   FAST) enables secure communication between a peer and a server by
   using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a mutually
   authenticated tunnel.  Within this tunnel a basic password exchange,
   based on the generic token card method (EAP-GTC), may be executed to
   authenticate the peer.

Internet-Draft              EAP-FAST with GTC              February 2008


1.  Introduction

   EAP-FAST [RFC4851] is an EAP method that can be used to mutually
   authenticate peer and server.  This document describes the method
   used by EAP-FAST to carry out a basic password exchange, based on
   EAP-GTC, to authenticate the peer.  EAP-GTC, described in [RFC3748],
   was chosen due to its versatility and simplicity.  Message exchanges,
   including user credentials, are in clear text strings, but within the
   encrypted TLS tunnel and thus are considered secure.  All EAP-GTC
   packets sent within the TLS tunnel must be encapsulated in EAP
   Payload TLVs.

   It is assumed that reader of this document is familiar with EAP-FAST
   [RFC4851].

1.1.  Specification Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  EAP-FAST GTC authentication

   All EAP-GTC packets other than the empty acknowledgment packet must
   follow the "LABEL=Value" format.  Currently, three Labels are
   defined:

   o  "REQUEST", the server request packet MUST be in the form of
      "REQUEST=Value", where Value is the server challenge, such as
      "please enter your password."

   o  "RESPONSE", the peer response packet MUST be in the form of
      "RESPONSE=Value", where Value is the peer response.

   o  "E", the server failure packet MUST be in the form of "E=Value",
      where Value is the error message generated by the server.

   If the peer or the server receive EAP-GTC request or response not in
   the format specified above, it should fail the authentication by
   sending Result TLV with a failure.

   After the TLS encryption tunnel is established and EAP-FAST
   Authentication Phase 2 starts, the EAP Server sends an EAP-GTC
   Request, which contains a server challenge, often with a displayable
   message for the user prompt.

   A peer may prompt the user for the user credentials, or decide to use
   the user credentials gained through some other means without
   prompting the user.  The peer sends the user credentials back in the
   EAP-GTC Response using the following format:

   "RESPONSE=user@example.com\0secret"

   where "user@example.com" is the actual user name and "secret" is the
   actual password.  The NULL character is used to separate the user
   name and password.

   The inclusion of both username and secret in a single message is to
   achieve optimization by eliminating the inner method EAP-Identity and
   save an extra round trip by peer sending both use name and password
   in the first response packet.

   Once the EAP-FAST Server receives the user credentials, it SHOULD
   first validate the user identity with the I-ID in the PAC-Opaque and
   if it matches, it will continue to authenticate the user with
   internal or external user databases.

   Additional exchanges may occur between the EAP-FAST server and peer
   to facilitate various user authentications.  The EAP-FAST Server

Internet-Draft              EAP-FAST with GTC              February 2008


   might send additional challenges to the peer for additional
   information, such as password change or new pin mode in the OTP
   [RFC2289] case.  The peer may prompt the user again and send back the
   needed information in EAP-GTC Response.

   An EAP-GTC server implementation within EAP-FAST uses the following
   format to indicate error if an authentication fails:

       "E=eeeeeeeeee R=r M=<msg>"

   where

   The "eeeeeeeeee" is the ASCII representation of a decimal error code
   corresponding to one of those listed below, though implementations
   should deal with codes not on this list gracefully.  The error code
   need not be 10 digits long.

   Below are some pre-defined error codes:

   o  646 ERROR_RESTRICTED_LOGON_HOURS

   o  647 ERROR_ACCT_DISABLED

   o  648 ERROR_PASSWD_EXPIRED

   o  649 ERROR_NO_DIALIN_PERMISSION

   o  691 ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE

   o  709 ERROR_CHANGING_PASSWORD

   o  755 ERROR_PAC_I-ID-NO_MATCH

   The "r" is a single character ASCII flag set to '1' if a retry is
   allowed, and '0' if not.  When the authenticator sets this flag to
   '1' it disables short timeouts, expecting the peer to prompt the user
   for new credentials and resubmit the response.

   The <msg> is human-readable text in the appropriate character set and
   language [RFC2484].

   Peer SHOULD ignore any unknown label in the failure packet.

   The error format described above is similar to what are defined in
   MSCHAPv2 [RFC2759], except for the omission of server challenge.  So
   if the EAP-FAST Server is distributing MSCHAPV2 exchanges to the
   backend inner method server, it can simply just return what the
   backend inner method server returns less the server challenge.  In

   the case of connecting to an OTP or LDAP [RFC4511] server, the EAP-
   FAST Server can format the error message into this format.  With the
   addition of the retry count, peer can potentially prompt the user for
   new credentials to try again without restarts the EAP-FAST
   authentication from the beginning.  Peer will respond to the error
   code with another EAP-GTC Response with either the new Username and
   Password or in case of other unrecoverable failures, an empty EAP-GTC
   packet for acknowledgement.  Peer uses empty GTC payload as an
   acknowledgment to the failure.

   If the EAP-FAST server finishes authentication, it will proceed to
   Protected Termination as described in [RFC4851].  In the case of an
   unrecoverable EAP-GTC authentication failure, the EAP server can send
   a GTC error code as described above, along with the Result TLV for
   protected termination.  This way, no extra round trips will occur.
   The peer can acknowledge the GTC failure as well as the Result TLV
   within the same EAP-FAST packet.  Once server receives the
   acknowledgement, the TLS tunnel will be torn down and a clear text
   EAP-Failure will be sent.

   The username and password, as well as server challenges MAY support
   non-ASCII characters.  In this case, International username,
   password, and messages are based on the use of Unicode characters,
   encoded as UTF-8 [RFC3629] and processed with a certain algorithm to
   ensure a canonical representation.  The input should be processed
   according to [RFC4282] Section 2.4..

   Since EAP-GTC doesn't generate session keys, the ISK used for crypto-
   binding for EAP-FAST will be filled with all zeros.

3.  Security Considerations

   The EAP-GTC method sends password information in the clear and MUST
   NOT be used outside of a protected tunnel such as the one provided by
   EAP-FAST.  In addition, the peer MUST authenticate the server before
   disclosing its credentials.  Since EAP-FAST Server-Unauthenticated
   Provisioning Mode does not authenticate the server, EAP-GTC MUST NOT
   be used as the inner method in this mode.  EAP-GTC MAY be used in
   EAP-FAST authentication and Server Authenticated Provisioning Mode,
   where the server is authenticated.

4.  IANA Considerations

   EAP-GTC has already been assigned the value of 6 for the EAP Type in
   [RFC3748].

   The document defines a registry for EAP-GTC error code, which may be
   assigned by Specification Required as defined in [RFC2434].  A
   summary of the error code types defined so far is given below:

   o  646 ERROR_RESTRICTED_LOGON_HOURS

   o  647 ERROR_ACCT_DISABLED

   o  648 ERROR_PASSWD_EXPIRED

   o  649 ERROR_NO_DIALIN_PERMISSION

   o  691 ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE

   o  709 ERROR_CHANGING_PASSWORD

   o  755 ERROR_PAC_I-ID-NO_MATCH
