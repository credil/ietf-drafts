1. Introduction

   Post Office Protocol (POP), defined in RFC 1939 [RFC1939], is an
   application-layer protocol used by local e-mail clients to retrieve
   e-mail from a remote server over a simple TCP/IP connection.  It uses
   the concept of states, which make management of the transaction
   easier; certain POP commands may only be given in the particular
   state.

   RFC 2449 [RFC2449] defines a way to extend Post Office Protocol (POP)
   [RFC1939] responses with additional information concerning details of
   processing some POP command.  The mechanism was named extended POP
   response codes; the extended POP response, additionally to status
   indicator, contains the response code, which concretize the reason
   for giving particular response.  Refer to Section 8 of RFC 2449 for
   further description.

   This document proposes a new experimental POP response code - WRONG-
   STATE - which is intended to be used in -ERR responses to commands
   given in the wrong state, e.g. STAT command given in the
   AUTHORIZATION state.  The new response code is also capable of
   carrying the information regarding the current state of server.

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The reader is supposed to be acquainted with RFC 1939 [RFC1939].

2. Response Code Definition

   The new POP response code is defined.  The name for the new response
   code is "WRONG-STATE".

INTERNET DRAFT       POP WRONG-STATE Response Code        August 4, 2011


   The WRONG-STATE response code SHOULD occur in the -ERR response
   returned to the command given in the wrong state, if such restriction
   takes places.  The WRONG-STATE response code MUST NOT be present in
   the +OK responses.

   The hierarchy is defined as follows.  The second-level element in the
   WRONG-STATE response code is the current state of the server.  The
   possible options of the server's state are "AUTHORIZATION",
   "TRANSACTION" and "UPDATE".  The second-level element is RECOMMENDED
   (but not required) in the WRONG-STATE response code.

   The example of use of WRONG-STATE response code is given below.

     C: <establishes connection to server>
     S: +OK CoolPOP Server Ready
     C: STAT
     S: -ERR [WRONG-STATE/AUTHORIZATION] Not in TRANSACTION state yet

   If the client's state is different from the server's one, it SHOULD
   be changed according to WRONG-STATE response.  The client SHALL
   ignore the second-level element of the response code if it contains
   the illegal state name, e. g. [WRONG-STATE/CONNECTION].

2.1. Formal Syntax

   The WRONG-STATE response is defined using ABNF [RFC5234] as follows.

     wrong-state-resp = "[" "WRONG-STATE" [ second-level ] "]"
     second-level     = "/" server-state
     server-state     = "AUTHORIZATION" / "TRANSACTION" / "UPDATE"

3. Security Considerations

   The new POP response code is not believed to raise any new security
   considerations.

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the new WRONG-STATE POP response code in
   the corresponding IANA registry with reference to this document.
