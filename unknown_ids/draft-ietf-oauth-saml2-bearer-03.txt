Internet-Draft     OAuth SAML Bearer Assertion Profile     February 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
   [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] is an XML-based framework that allows
   identity and security information to be shared across security
   domains.  The SAML specification, while primarily targeted at
   providing cross domain Web browser single sign-on, was also designed
   to be modular and extensible to facilitate use in other contexts.

   The Assertion, an XML security token, is a fundamental construct of
   SAML that is often adopted for use in other protocols and
   specifications.  An Assertion is generally issued by an identity
   provider and consumed by a service provider who relies on its content
   to identify the Assertion's subject for security related purposes.

   The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2] provides a
   method for making authenticated HTTP requests to a resource using an
   access token.  Access tokens are issued to third-party clients by an
   authorization server (AS) with the (sometimes implicit) approval of
   the resource owner.  In OAuth, an authorization grant is an abstract
   term used to describe intermediate credentials that represent the
   resource owner authorization.  An authorization grant is used by the
   client to obtain an access token.

   Several authorization grant types are defined to support a wide range
   of client types and user experiences.  OAuth also allows for the
   definition of new extension grant types to support additional clients
   or to provide a bridge between OAuth and other trust frameworks.

   This specification defines an extension grant type that profiles the
   use of a SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion in requesting an OAuth 2.0 access
   token.  The format and processing rules for the SAML Assertion
   defined in this specification are intentionally similar, though not
   identical, to those in the Web Browser SSO Profile defined in SAML
   Profiles [OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os].  This specification is
   reusing, to the extent reasonable, concepts and patterns from that
   well-established Profile.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Unless otherwise noted, all the protocol parameter names and values
   are case sensitive.

2.  SAML Assertion Access Token Request

   A SAML Assertion can be used to request an access token when a client
   wishes to utilize an existing trust relationship, expressed through
   the semantics of (and digital signature calculated over) the SAML
   Assertion, without a direct user approval step at the authorization
   server.

   The process by which the client obtains the SAML Assertion, prior to
   exchanging it with the authorization server, is out of scope.

        +--------+                                  +---------------+


                 Figure 1: Assertion Access Token Request

   The request/response flow illustrated in Figure 1 includes the
   following steps:

   (A)  The client sends an access token request to the authorization
        server that includes a SAML 2.0 Assertion and a grant_type of
        "http://oauth.net/grant_type/assertion/saml/2.0/bearer".

   (B)  The authorization server validates the Assertion per the
        processing rules defined in this specification and issues an
        access token.

2.1.  Client Requests Access Token

   The client includes the Assertion in the access token request, the
   core details of which are defined in OAuth [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2], by
   specifying "http://oauth.net/grant_type/assertion/saml/2.0/bearer" as
   the absolute URI value of the "grant_type" parameter and by adding
   the following parameter:

   assertion
         REQUIRED.  The value of the assertion parameter MUST contain a
         single SAML 2.0 Assertion.  When used with the
         "http://oauth.net/grant_type/assertion/saml/2.0/bearer" grant
         type, the assertion MUST be a SAML 2.0 Assertion.  The SAML

Internet-Draft     OAuth SAML Bearer Assertion Profile     February 2011


         Assertion XML data MUST be encoded using base64url, where the
         encoding adheres to the definition in Section 5 of RFC4648
         [RFC4648] and where the padding bits are set to zero.  To to
         avoid the need for subsequent encoding steps (by "application/
         x-www-form-urlencoded" [W3C.REC-html401-19991224], for
         example), the base64url encoded data SHOULD NOT be line wrapped
         and pad characters ("=") SHOULD NOT be included.

   scope
         OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access request is expressed as a
         list of space-delimited strings.  The value is defined by the
         authorization server.  If the value contains multiple space-
         delimited strings, their order does not matter, and each string
         adds an additional access range to the requested scope.

   Authorization servers SHOULD issue access tokens with a limited
   lifetime and require clients to refresh them by requesting a new
   access token using the same assertion, if it is still valid, or with
   a new assertion.  The authorization server SHOULD NOT issue a refresh
   token.

2.2.  Assertion Format and Processing Requirements

   Prior to issuing an access token response as described in
   [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2], the authorization server MUST validate the
   Assertion according to the criteria below.  If present, the
   authorization server MUST also validate the client credentials.
   Application of additional restrictions and policy are at the
   discretion of the authorization server.

   o  The Assertion's <Issuer> element MUST contain a unique identifier
      for the entity that issued the Assertion.  The Format attribute
      MUST be omitted or have a value of
      "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:entity".

   o  The Assertion MUST contain a <Subject> element.  The subject MAY
      identify the resource owner for whom the access token is being
      requested.

   o  The <Subject> element MUST contain at least one
      <SubjectConfirmation> element that allows the authorization server
      to confirm it as a Bearer Assertion.  Conditions for bearer
      subject confirmation are described below.

      *  The <SubjectConfirmation> MUST have a Method attribute with a
         value of "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer" and MUST
         contain a <SubjectConfirmationData> element.

Internet-Draft     OAuth SAML Bearer Assertion Profile     February 2011


      *  The <SubjectConfirmationData> element MUST have a Recipient
         attribute with a value indicating the token endpoint URL of the
         authorization server.  The authorization server MUST verify
         that the value of the Recipient attribute matches the token
         endpoint URL (or an acceptable alias) to which the Assertion
         was delivered.

      *  The <SubjectConfirmationData> element MUST have a NotOnOrAfter
         attribute that limits the window during which the Assertion can
         be confirmed.  The authorization server MUST verify that the
         NotOnOrAfter instant has not passed, subject to allowable clock
         skew between systems.  The authorization server MAY ensure that
         Bearer Assertions are not replayed, by maintaining the set of
         used ID values for the length of time for which the Assertion
         would be considered valid based on the NotOnOrAfter attribute
         in the <SubjectConfirmationData>.  The authorization server MAY
         reject assertions with a NotOnOrAfter instant that is
         unreasonably far in the future.

      *  The <SubjectConfirmationData> element MAY also contain an
         Address attribute limiting the client address from which the
         Assertion can be delivered.  Verification of the Address is at
         the discretion of the authorization server.

   o  If the Assertion issuer authenticated the subject, the Assertion
      SHOULD contain a single <AuthnStatement> representing that
      authentication event.

   o  If the Assertion was issued with the intention that the client act
      autonomously on behalf of the subject, an <AuthnStatement> SHOULD
      NOT be included.  The client SHOULD be identified in the <NameID>
      or similar element, the <SubjectConfirmation> element, or by other
      available means like [OASIS.saml-deleg-cs].

   o  Other statements, in particular <AttributeStatement> elements, MAY
      be included in the Assertion.

   o  The Assertion MUST contain an <AudienceRestriction> element with
      an <Audience> element containing a URI reference that identifies
      the authorization server, or the service provider SAML entity of
      its controlling domain, as an intended audience.  The
      authorization server MUST verify that it is an intended audience
      for the Assertion.

   o  The Assertion MUST be digitally signed by the issuer and the
      authorization server MUST verify the signature.

Internet-Draft     OAuth SAML Bearer Assertion Profile     February 2011


   o  Encrypted elements MAY appear in place of their plain text
      counterparts as defined in [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os].

   o  The authorization server MUST verify that the Assertion is valid
      in all other respects per [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os], such as (but
      not limited to) evaluating all content within the Conditions
      element including the NotOnOrAfter and NotBefore attributes,
      rejecting unknown condition types, etc.

2.3.  Error Response

   If the Assertion is not valid, or its subject confirmation
   requirements cannot be met, the authorization server MUST construct
   an error response as defined in [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].  The value of
   the error parameter MUST be the "invalid_grant" error code.  The
   authorization server MAY include additional information regarding the
   reasons the Assertion was considered invalid using the
   error_description or error_uri parameters.

   For example:


   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "error":"invalid_grant",
     "error_description":"Audience validation failed"
   }


2.4.  Example (non-normative)

   Though non-normative, the following examples illustrate what a
   conforming Assertion and access token request would look like.

   To present the Assertion shown in the previous example as part of an
   access token request, for example, the client might make the
   following HTTPS request (line breaks are for display purposes only):
