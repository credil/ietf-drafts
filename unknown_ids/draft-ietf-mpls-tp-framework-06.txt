Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework               October 2009


Abstract

   This document specifies an architectural framework for the
   application of Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) in transport
   networks, by enabling the construction of packet switched equivalents
   to traditional circuit switched carrier networks.  It describes a
   common set of protocol functions - the MPLS Transport Profile
   (MPLS-TP) - that supports the operational models and capabilities
   typical of such networks for point-to-point paths, including signaled
   or explicitly provisioned bi-directional connection-oriented paths,
   protection and restoration mechanisms, comprehensive Operations,
   Administration and Maintenance (OAM) functions, and network operation
   in the absence of a dynamic control plane or IP forwarding support.
   Some of these functions exist in existing MPLS specifications, while
   others require extensions to existing specifications to meet the
   requirements of the MPLS-TP.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   Although this document is not a protocol specification, these key
   words are to be interpreted as instructions to the protocol designers
   producing solutions that satisfy the architectural concepts set out
   in this document.

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework               October 2009


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation and Background

   This document describes a framework for a Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  It presents the architectural
   framework for MPLS-TP, defining those elements of MPLS applicable to
   supporting the requirements in [RFC5654] and what new protocol
   elements are required.

   Historically the optical transport infrastructure (Synchronous
   Optical Networking (SONET)/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH),
   Optical Transport Network (OTN)) has provided carriers with a high
   benchmark for reliability and operational simplicity.  To achieve
   this transport technologies have been designed with specific
   characteristics :

   o  Strictly connection-oriented connectivity, which may be long-lived
      and may be provisioned manually or by network management.

   o  A high level of protection and availability.

   o  Quality of service.

   o  Extended OAM capabilities.

   Carriers wish to evolve such transport networks to support packet
   based services, and to take advantage of the flexibility and cost
   benefits of packet switching technology.  While MPLS is a maturing
   packet technology that is already playing an important role in
   transport networks and services, not all of MPLS's capabilities and
   mechanisms are needed and/or consistent with transport network
   operations.  There are also transport technology characteristics that
   are not currently reflected in MPLS.

   The types of packet transport services delivered by transport
   networks are very similar to Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks defined
   by the IETF.

   There are thus two objectives for MPLS-TP:

   1.  To enable MPLS to be deployed in a transport network and operated
       in a similar manner to existing transport technologies.

   2.  To enable MPLS to support packet transport services with a
       similar degree of predictability to that found in existing
       transport networks.

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework               October 2009


   In order to achieve these objectives, there is a need to create a
   common set of new functions that are applicable to both MPLS networks
   in general, and those belonging to the MPLS-TP profile.

   MPLS-TP therefore defines a profile of MPLS targeted at transport
   applications and networks.  This profile specifies the specific MPLS
   characteristics and extensions required to meet transport
   requirements.

1.2.  Scope

   This document describes an architectural framework for the
   application of MPLS to transport networks.  It specifies the common
   set of protocol functions that meet the requirements in [RFC5654],
   and that together constitute the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).
   The architecture for point-to-point MPLS-TP paths is described.  The
   architecture for point-to-multipoint paths is outside the scope of
   this document.

1.3.1.  MPLS Transport Profile.

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the subset of MPLS functions
   that meet the requirements in [RFC5654].  Note that MPLS is defined
   to include any present and future MPLS capability specified by the
   IETF, including those capabilities specifically added to support the
   transport network requirement [RFC5654].

1.3.2.  MPLS-TP Section

   An MPLS-TP Section is defined in Section 1.1.2 of [RFC5654].

1.3.3.  MPLS-TP Label Switched Path

   An MPLS-TP Label Switched Path (MPLS-TP LSP) is an LSP that uses a
   subset of the capabilities of an MPLS LSP in order to meet the
   requirements of an MPLS transport network as set out in [RFC5654].
   The characteristics of an MPLS-TP LSP are primarily that it:

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework               October 2009


   1.  Uses a subset of the MPLS OAM tools defined as described in
       [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework].

   2.  Supports only 1+1, 1:1, and 1:N protection functions.

   3.  Is traffic engineered.

   4.  Is established and maintained using GMPLS protocols when a
       control plane is used.

   5.  LSPs can only be point to point or point to multipoint, i.e. the
       merging of LSPs is not permitted.

   Note that an MPLS LSP is defined to include any present and future
   MPLS capability include those specifically added to support the
   transport network requirements.

1.3.4.  MPLS-TP Label Switching Router (LSR) and Label Edge Router (LER)

   An MPLS-TP Label Switching Router (MPLS-TP LSR) is either an MPLS-TP
   Provider Edge (MPLS-TP PE) or an MPLS-TP Provider (MPLS-TP P Router)
   router for a given LSP, as defined below.  The terms MPLS-TP PE and
   MPLS-TP P router describe functions and specific node may undertake
   both roles.

   Note that the use of the term "router" in this context is historic
   and neither requires nor precludes the ability to perform IP
   forwarding.

1.3.4.1.  MPLS-TP Provider Edge Router (PE)

   An MPLS-TP Provider Edge Router is an MPLS-TP LSR that adapts client
   traffic and encapsulates it to be carried over an MPLS-TP LSP.
   Encapsulation may be as simple as pushing a label, or it may require
   the use of a pseudowire.  An MPLS-TP PE exists at the interface
   between a pair of layer networks.  For an MS-PW, an MPLS-TP PE may be
   either an S-PE or a T-PE.

   A layer network is defined in [G.805].

1.3.4.2.  MPLS-TP Provider Router (P)

   An MPLS-TP Provider router is an MPLS-TP LSR that does not provide
   MPLS-TP PE functionality.  An MPLS-TP P router switches LSPs which
   carry client traffic, but do not adapt the client traffic and
   encapsulate it to be carried over an MPLS-TP LSP.

1.3.5.  MPLS-TP Customer Edge (CE)

   An MPLS-TP Customer Edge is the client function sourcing or sinking
   client traffic to or from the MPLS-TP network.  CEs on either side of
   the MPLS-TP network are peers and view the MPLS-TP network as a
   single point to point or point to multi-point link.  These clients
   have no knowledge of the presence of the interveining MPLS-TP
   network.

1.3.6.  Additional Definitions and Terminology

   Detailed definitions and additional terminology may be found in
   [RFC5654].

1.4.  Applicability

   MPLS-TP can be used to construct a packet transport networks and is
   therefore applicable in any packet transport network application.  It
   is also as an alternative architecture for subsets of a packet
   network where the transport network model is deemed attractive.  The
   following are examples of MPLS-TP applicability models:

   1.  MPLS-TP provided by a network that only supports MPLS-TP, acting
       as a server for other layer 1, layer 2 and layer 3 networks
       (Figure 1).

   2.  MPLS-TP provided by a network that also supports non-MPLS-TP
       functions, acting as a server for other layer 1, layer 2 and
       layer 3 networks (Figure 2).

   3.  MPLS-TP as a server layer for client layer traffic of IP or MPLS
       networks which do not use functions of the MPLS transport profile
       (Figure 3).

   These models are not mutually exclusive.

2.  Introduction to Requirements

   The requirements for MPLS-TP are specified in [RFC5654],
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements], and [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-req].
   This section provides a brief reminder to guide the reader and is
   therefore not normative.  It is not intended as a substitute for
   these documents.

   MPLS-TP must not modify the MPLS forwarding architecture and must be
   based on existing pseudowire and LSP constructs.

   Point to point LSPs may be unidirectional or bi-directional, and it
   must be possible to construct congruent Bi-directional LSPs.

   MPLS-TP LSPs do not merge with other LSPs at an MPLS-TP LSR and it
   must be possible to detect if a merged LSP has been created.

   It must be possible to forward packets solely based on switching the
   MPLS or PW label.  It must also be possible to establish and maintain
   LSPs and/or pseudowires both in the absence or presence of a dynamic
   control plane.  When static provisioning is used, there must be no
   dependency on dynamic routing or signaling.

   OAM, protection and forwarding of data packets must be able to
   operate without IP forwarding support.

   It must be possible to monitor LSPs and pseudowires through the use
   of OAM in the absence of control plane or routing functions.  In this

   case information gained from the OAM functions is used to initiate
   path recovery actions at either the PW or LSP layers.

3.  Transport Profile Overview

3.1.  Packet Transport Services

   One objective of MPLS-TP is to enable MPLS networks to provide packet
   transport services with a similar degree of predictability to that
   found in existing transport networks.  Such packet transport services
   inherit a number of characteristics, defined in [RFC5654]:

   o  In an environment where an MPLS-TP layer network is supporting a
      client layer network, and the MPLS-TP layer network is supported
      by a server layer network then operation of the MPLS-TP layer
      network MUST be possible without any dependencies on the server or
      client layer network.

   o  The service provided by the MPLS-TP network to the client is
      guaranteed not to fall below the agreed level regardless of other
      client activity.

   o  The control and management planes of any client network layer that
      uses the service is isolated from the control and management
      planes of the MPLS-TP layer network.

   o  Where a client network makes use of an MPLS-TP server that
      provides a packet transport service, the level of co-ordination
      required between the client and server layer networks is minimal
      (preferably no co-ordination will be required).

   o  The complete set of packets generated by a client MPLS(-TP) layer
      network using the packet transport service, which may contain
      packets that are not MPLS packets (e.g.  IP or CNLS packets used
      by the control/management plane of the client MPLS(-TP) layer
      network), are transported by the MPLS-TP server layer network.

   o  The packet transport service enables the MPLS-TP layer network
      addressing and other information (e.g. topology) to be hidden from
      any client layer networks using that service, and vice-versa.

   Therefore, a packet transport service doe not support a
   connectionless packet switched forwarding mode.  However, this does
   not preclude it carrying client traffic associated with a
   connectionless service.

3.2.  Scope of MPLS Transport Profile

   Figure 4 illustrates the scope of MPLS-TP.  MPLS-TP solutions are
   primarily intended for packet transport applications.  MPLS-TP is a
   strict sub-set of MPLS, and comprises those functions that meet the
   requirements of [RFC5654].  This includes MPLS functions that were
   defined prior to [RFC5654] but that meet the requirements of
   [RFC5654], together with additional functions defined to meet those
   requirements.  Some MPLS functions defined before [RFC5654] e.g.
   Equal Cost Multi-Path, LDP signaling used in such a way that it
   creates multi-point to point LSPs, and IP forwarding in the data
   plane are explicitly excluded from MPLS-TP by that requirements
   specification.

   Note that this does not preclude the future definition of MPLS
   functions that do not meet the requirements of [RFC5654] and thus
   fall outside the scope of MPLS-TP as defined by this document.

3.3.  Architecture

   MPLS-TP comprises the following

   o  Sections, LSPs and PWs that provide a packet transport service for
      a client network.

   o  Proactive and on demand Operations Administration and Maintenance
      (OAM) functions to monitor and diagnose the MPLS-TP network. e.g.
      connectivity check, connectivity verification, and performance
      monitoring.

   o  Optional control planes for LSPs and PWs, as well as static
      configuration.

   o  Path protection mechanisms to ensure that the packet transport
      service survives anticipated failures and degradations of the
      MPLS-TP network.

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework               October 2009


   o  Network management functions.

   The MPLS-TP architecture for LSPs and PWs includes the the following
   two sets of functions:

   o  MPLS-TP adaptation

   o  MPLS-TP forwarding

   The adaptation functions interface the client service to MPLS-TP.
   This includes the case where the client service is an MPLS-TP LSP.

   The forwarding functions comprise the mechanisms required for
   forwarding the encapsulated client over an MPLS-TP server layer
   network E.g.  PW label and LSP label.

3.3.1.  MPLS-TP Adaptation

   The MPLS-TP adaptation interfaces the client service to MPLS-TP.  For
   pseudowires, these adaptation functions are the payload encapsulation
   shown in Figure 7 of [RFC3985] and Figure 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch].  For network layer client services, the
   adaptation function uses the MPLS encapsulation format as defined in
   RFC 3032[RFC3032].

   The purpose of this encapsulation is to abstract the client service
   data plane from the MPLS-TP data plane, thus contributing to the
   independent operation of the MPLS-TP network.

   MPLS-TP is itself a client of an underlying server layer.  MPLS-TP is
   thus also bounded by a set of adaptation functions to this server
   layer network, which may itself be MPLS-TP.  These adaptation
   functions provide encapsulation of the MPLS-TP frames and for the
   transparent transport of those frames over the server layer network.
   The MPLS-TP client inherits its QoS from the MPLS-TP network, which
   in turn inherits its QoS from the server layer.  The server layer
   must therefore provide the necessary Quality of Service (QoS) to
   ensure that the MPLS-TP client QoS commitments are satisfied.

3.3.2.  MPLS-TP Forwarding Functions

   The forwarding functions comprise the mechanisms required for
   forwarding the encapsulated client over an MPLS-TP server layer
   network E.g.  PW label and LSP label.

   MPLS-TP LSPs use the MPLS label switching operations and TTL
   processing procedures defined in [RFC3031] and [RFC3032].  These
   operations are highly optimized for performance and are not modified



Bocci, et al.            Expires April 19, 2010                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework               October 2009


   by the MPLS-TP profile.

   In addition, MPLS-TP PWs use the PW and MS-PW forwarding operations
   defined in[RFC3985] and [I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch].  The PW label is
   processed by a PW forwarder and is always at the bottom of the label
   stack for a given MPLS-TP layer network.

   Per-platform label space is used for PWs.  Either per-platform, per-
   interface or other context-specific label space may be used for LSPs.

   MPLS-TP forwarding is based on the label that identifies the
   transport path (LSP or PW).  The label value specifies the processing
   operation to be performed by the next hop at that level of
   encapsulation.  A swap of this label is an atomic operation in which
   the contents of the packet after the swapped label are opaque to the
   forwarder.  The only event that interrupts a swap operation is TTL
   expiry.  This is a fundamental architectural construct of MPLS to be
   taken into account when design protocol extensions that requires
   packets (e.g.  OAM packets) to be sent to an intermediate LSR.

   Further processing to determine the context of a packet occurs when a
   swap operation is interrupted in this manner, or a pop operation
   exposes a specific reserved label at the top of the stack.  Otherwise
   the packet is forwarded according to the procedures in [RFC3032].

   Point to point MPLS-TP LSPs can be either unidirectional or
   bidirectional.

   It MUST be possible to configure an MPLS-TP LSP such that the forward
   and backward directions of a bidirectional MPLS-TP LSP are co-routed
   i.e. they follow the same path.  The pairing relationship between the
   forward and the backward directions must be known at each LSR or LER
   on a bidirectional LSP.

   In normal conditions, all the packets sent over a PW or an LSP follow
   the same path through the network and those that belong to a common
   ordered aggregate are delivered in order.  For example per-packet
   equal cost multi-path (ECMP) load balancing is not applicable to
   MPLS-TP LSPs.

   Penultimate hop popping (PHP) is disabled on MPLS-TP LSPs by default.

   Both E-LSP and L-LSP are supported in MPLS-TP, as defined in
   [RFC3270].

   The Traffic Class field (formerly the MPLS EXP field) follows the
   definition and processing rules of [RFC5462] and [RFC3270].

   Only the pipe and short-pipe models are supported in MPLS-TP.

3.4.  MPLS-TP Client Adaptation

   This document specifies the architecture for two types of client
   adaptation:

   o  A PW

   o  An MPLS Label

   When the client is a PW, the MPLS-TP client adaptation functions
   include the PW encapsulation mechanisms, including the PW control
   word.  When the client is operating at the network layer the
   mechanism described in Section 3.4.2 is used.

3.4.1.  Adaptation using Pseudowires

   The architecture for a transport profile of MPLS (MPLS-TP) that uses
   PWs is based on the MPLS [RFC3031] and pseudowire [RFC3985]
   architectures.  If multi-segment pseudowires are used to provide a
   packet transport service, motivated by, for example, the requirements
   specified in [RFC5254] then the MS-PW architecture
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch] also applies.

   Figure 5 shows the architecture for an MPLS-TP network using single-
   segment PWs.

   (VPMS) or Internet Protocol Local Area Network Service (IPLS),
   pseudowires MUST be used to carry the client service.  These PWs can
   be configured either statically or via the control plane defined in
   [RFC4447].

   Note that in MPLS-TP environments where IP is used for control or OAM
   purposes, IP MAY be carried over the LSP demultiplexers as per
   RFC3031 [RFC3031], or directly over the server.

3.4.2.  Network Layer Clients

   MPLS-TP LSPs can be used to transport network layer clients.  Any
   network layer protocol can be transported between service interfaces.
   Examples of network layer protocols include IP, MPLS and MPLS-TP.

   With network layer transport, the MPLS-TP domain provides a
   bidirectional point-to-point connection between two customer edge
   (CE) nodes.  Note that a CE may be an an IP, MPLS or MPLS-TP node.
   As shown in Figure 8, there is an attachment circuit between the CE
   node on the left and its corresponding provider edge (PE) node that
   provides the service interface, a bidirectional LSP across the
   MPLS-TP service network to the corresponding PE node on the right,
   and an attachment circuit between that PE node and the corresponding
   CE node for this service.

   At the ingress service interface the PE transforms the ingress packet
   to the format that will be carried over the transport network, and
   similarly the corresponding service interface at the egress PE
   transforms the packet to the format needed by the attached CE.  The
   attachment circuits may be heterogeneous (e.g., any combination of
   SDH, PPP, Frame Relay etc) and network layer protocol payloads arrive
   at the service interface encapsulated in the Layer1/Layer2 encoding
   defined for that access link type.  It should be noted that the set
   of network layer protocols includes MPLS and hence MPLS encoded
   packets with an MPLS label stack (the client MPLS stack), may appear
   at the service interface.

     Figure 9: Domain of MPLS-TP Layer Network for IP and LSP Clients

   Within the MPLS-TP transport network, the network layer protocols are
   carried over the MPLS-TP LSP using a separate MPLS label stack (the
   server stack).  The server stack is entirely under the control of the
   nodes within the MPLS-TP transport network and it is not visible
   outside that network.  In accordance with [RFC3032], the bottom
   label, with the 'bottom of stack' bit set to '1', defines the network
   layer protocol being transported.  Figure 9 shows how an a client
   network protocol stack (which may be an MPLS label stack and payload)
   is carried over as a network layer transport service over an MPLS-TP
   transport network.

   A label per network layer protocol payload type that is to be

   transported is REQUIRED.  Such labels are referred to as "Service
   Labels", one of which is shown in Figure 9.  The mapping between
   protocol payload type and Service Label is either configured or
   signaled.

   Service labels are typically carried over an MPLS-TP edge-to-edge
   LSP, which is also shown in Figure 9.  The use of an edge-to-edge LSP
   is RECOMMENDED when more than one protocol payload type is to be
   transported.  For example, if only MPLS is carried then a single
   Service Label would be used to provided both payload type indication
   and the MPLS-TP edge-to-edge LSP.  Alternatively, if both IP and MPLS
   is to be carried then two Service Labels would be mapped on to a
   common MPLS-TP edge-to-edge LSP.

   As noted above, any layer 2 and layer 1 protocols used to carry the
   network layer protocol over the attachment circuit is terminated at
   the service interface and is not transported across the MPLS-TP
   network.  This enables the use of different layer 2 / layer 1
   technologies at two service interfaces.

   At each service interface, Layer 2 addressing must be used to ensure
   the proper delivery of a network layer packet to the adjacent node.
   This is typically only an issue for LAN media technologies (e.g.,
   Ethernet) which have Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  In cases
   where a MAC address is needed, the sending node MUST set the
   destination MAC address to an address that ensures delivery to the
   adjacent node.  That is the CE sets the destination MAC address to an
   address that ensures delivery to the PE, and the PE sets the
   destination MAC address to an address that ensures delivery to the
   CE.  The specific address used is technology type specific and is not
   covered in this document.  In some technologies the MAC address will
   need to be configured (Examples for the Ethernet case include a
   configured unicast MAC address for the adjacent node, or even using
   the broadcast MAC address when the CE-PE service interface is
   dedicated.  The configured address is then used as the MAC
   destination address for all packets sent over the service interface.)

   Note that when the two CEs operating over the network layer transport
   service are running a routing protocol such as ISIS or OSPF some care
   should be taken to configure the routing protocols to use point- to-
   point adjacencies.  The specifics of such configuration is outside
   the scope of this document.

   [Editors Note we need to confer with ISIS and OSPF WG to verify that
   the cautionary note above is necessary and sufficient.]

   The CE to CE service types and corresponding labels may be configured
   or signaled.  When they are signaled the CE to PE control channel may

   be either out-of-band or in-band.  An out-of-band control channel
   uses standard GMPLS out-of-band signaling techniques.  There are a
   number of methods that can be used to carry this signalling:

   o  It can be carried via an out-of-band control channel.  (As is
      commonly done in today's GMPLS controlled transport networks.)

   o  It could be carried over the attachment circuit with MPLS using a
      reserved label.

   o  It could be carried over the attachment circuit with MPLS using a
      normal label that is agreed between CE and PE.

   o  It could be carried over the attachment circuit in an ACH.

   o  It could be carried over the attachment circuit in IP.

   In the MPLS and ACH cases above, this label value is used to carry
   LSP signaling without any further encapsulation.  This signaling
   channel is always point-to-point and MUST use local CE and PE
   addressing.

   The method(s) to be used will be described in a future version of the
   document.

3.5.  Identifiers

   Identifiers to be used in within MPLS-TP where compatibility with
   existing MPLS control plane conventions are necessary are described
   in [draft-swallow-mpls-tp-identifiers-00].  The MPLS-TP requirements
   [RFC5654] require that the elements and objects in an MPLS-TP
   environment are able to be configured and managed without a control
   plane.  In such an environment many conventions for defining
   identifiers are possible.  However it is also anticipated that
   operational environments where MPLS-TP objects, LSPs and PWs will be
   signaled via existing protocols such as the Label Distribution
   Protocol [RFC4447] and the Resource Reservation Protocol as it is
   applied to Generalized Multi-protocol Label Switching ( [RFC3471] and
   [RFC3473]) (GMPLS). [draft-swallow-mpls-tp-identifiers-00] defines a
   set of identifiers for MPLS-TP which are both compatible with those
   protocols and applicable to MPLS-TP management and OAM functions.

   MPLS-TP distinguishes between addressing used to identify nodes in
   the network, and identifiers used for demultiplexing and forwarding.

   Whilst IP addressing is used by default, MPLS-TP must be able to
   operate in environments where IP is not used in the forwarding plane.
   Therefore, the default mechanism for OAM demultiplexing in MPLS-TP



Bocci, et al.            Expires April 19, 2010                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework               October 2009


   LSPs and PWs is the generic associated channel.  Forwarding based on
   IP addresses for user or OAM packets is not REQUIRED for MPLS-TP.

   [RFC4379]and BFD for MPLS LSPs [I-D.ietf-bfd-mpls] have defined alert
   mechanisms that enable an MPLS LSR to identify and process MPLS OAM
   packets when the OAM packets are encapsulated in an IP header.  These
   alert mechanisms are based on TTL expiration and/or use an IP
   destination address in the range 127/8.  These mechanisms are the
   default mechanisms for MPLS networks in general for identifying MPLS
   OAM packets when the OAM packets are encapsulated in an IP header.
   MPLS-TP is unable to rely on the availability of IP and thus uses the
   GACH/GAL to demultiplex OAM packets.

3.6.  Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)

   MPLS-TP supports a comprehensive set of OAM capabilities for packet
   transport applications, with equivalent capabilities to those
   provided in SONET/SDH.

   MPLS-TP defines mechanisms to differentiate specific packets (e.g.
   OAM, APS, MCC or SCC) from those carrying user data packets on the
   same LSP.  These mechanisms are described in [RFC5586].

   MPLS-TP requires [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements] that a set of
   OAM capabilities is available to perform fault management (e.g. fault
   detection and localization) and performance monitoring (e.g. packet
   delay and loss measurement) of the LSP, PW or section.  The framework
   for OAM in MPLS-TP is specified in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework].

   MPLS-TP OAM packets share the same fate as their corresponding data
   packets, and are identified through the Generic Associated Channel
   mechanism [RFC5586].  This uses a combination of an Associated
   Channel Header (ACH) and a Generic Alert Label (GAL) to create a
   control channel associated to an LSP, Section or PW.

3.6.1.  OAM Architecture

   OAM and monitoring in MPLS-TP is based on the concept of maintenance
   entities, as described in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework].  A
   Maintenance Entity can be viewed as the association of two (or more)
   Maintenance End Points (MEPs) (see example in Figure 10 ).  The MEPs
   that form an ME should be configured and managed to limit the OAM
   responsibilities of an OAM flow within a network or sub- network, or
   a transport path or segment, in the specific layer network that is
   being monitored and managed.

   Each OAM flow is associated with a single ME.  Each MEP within an ME
   resides at the boundaries of that ME.  An ME may also include a set

   of zero or more Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIPs), which reside
   within the Maintenance Entity.  Maintenance end points (MEPs) are
   capable of sourcing and sinking OAM flows, while maintenance
   intermediate points (MIPs) can only sink or respond to OAM flows.

      of an end-to-end LSP (between LERs).

      of an end-to-end SS/MS-PWs (between T-PEs).

   o  An LSP Tandem Connection Maintenance Entity (LTCME), allowing
      estimation of OAM fault and performance metrics of a single LSP
      segment or of an aggregate of LSP segments.  It also enables any
      OAM function applied to segment(s) of an LSP to be independent of
      the OAM function(s) operated on the end-to-end LSP.  This can be
      achieved by including a label representing the LTCME on one or
      more LSP label stacks for 1:1 or N:1 monitoring of LSPs,
      respectively.  Note that the term Tandem Connection Monitoring has
      historical significance dating back to the early days of the
      telephone network, but is equally applicable to the hierarchal
      architectures commonly employed in todays packet networks.

   Individual MIPs along the path of an LSP or PW are addressed by
   setting the appropriate TTL in the label for the OAM packet, as per
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw].  Note that this works when the location
   of MIPs along the LSP or PW path is known by the MEP.  There may be
   cases where this is not the case in general MPLS networks e.g.
   following restoration using a facility bypass LSP.  In these cases,
   tools to trace the path of the LSP may be used to determine the
   appropriate setting for the TTL to reach a specific MIP.

   Within an LSR or PE, MEPs and MIPs can only be placed where MPLS
   layer processing is performed on a packet.  The architecture mandates
   that this must occur at least once.

   There is only one MIP on an LSP or PW in each node.  That MIP is for
   all applicable OAM functions on its associated LSP or PW.  This
   document does not specify the default position of the MIP within the
   node.  Therefore, this document does not specify where the exception
   mechanism resides (i.e. at the ingress interface, the egress
   interface, or some other location within the node).  An optional
   protocol may be developed that sets the position of a MIP along the
   path of an LSP or PW within the node (and thus determines the
   exception processing location).

   MEPs may only act as a sink of OAM packets when the label associated
   with the LSP or PW for that ME is popped.  MIPs can only be placed
   where an exception to the normal forwarding operation occurs.  A MEP
   may act as a source of OAM packets whereever a label is pushed or
   swapped.  For example, on a MS-PW, a MEP may source OAM within an
   S-PE or a T-PE, but a MIP may only be associated with a S-PE and a
   sink MEP can only be associated with a T-PE.

3.6.2.  OAM Functions

   The MPLS-TP OAM architecture support a wide range of OAM functions,
   including the following




Bocci, et al.            Expires April 19, 2010                [Page 25]

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework               October 2009


   o  Continuity Check

   o  Connectivity Verification

   o  Performance monitoring (e.g. loss and delay)

   o  Alarm suppression

   o  Remote Integrity

   These are applicable to any layer defined within MPLS-TP, i.e.  MPLS
   Section, LSP and PW.

   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset needs to be able to operate without relying
   on a dynamic control plane or IP functionality in the datapath.  In
   the case of MPLS-TP deployment with IP functionality, all existing
   IP-MPLS OAM functions, e.g.  LSP-Ping, BFD and VCCV, may be used.
   This does not preclude the use of other OAM tools in an IP
   addressable network.

   One use of OAM mechanisms is to detect link failures, node failures
   and performance outside the required specification which then may be
   used to trigger recovery actions, according to the requirements of
   the service.

3.7.  Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh)

   For correct operation of the OAM it is important that the OAM packets
   fate share with the data packets.  In addition in MPSL-TP it is
   necessary to discriminate between user data payloads and other types
   of payload.  For example the packet may contain a Signaling
   Communication Channel (SCC), or a channel used for Automatic
   Protection Switching (APS) data.  Such packets are carried on a
   control channel associated to the LSP, Section or PW.  This is
   achieved by carrying such packets on a generic control channel
   associated to the LSP, PW or section.

   MPLS-TP makes use of such a generic associated channel (G-ACh) to
   support Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security
   (FCAPS) functions by carrying packets related to OAM, APS, SCC, MCC
   or other packet types in band over LSPs or PWs.  The G-ACH is defined
   in [RFC5586] and it is similar to the Pseudowire Associated Channel
   [RFC4385], which is used to carry OAM packets across pseudowires.
   The G-ACH is indicated by a generic associated channel header (ACH),
   similar to the Pseudowire VCCV control word, and this is present for
   all Sections, LSPs and PWs making use of FCAPS functions supported by
   the G-ACH.




Bocci, et al.            Expires April 19, 2010                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework               October 2009


   For pseudowires, the G-ACh use the first nibble of the pseudowire
   control word to provide the initial discrimination between data
   packets a packets belonging to the associated channel, as described
   in[RFC4385].  When the first nibble of a packet, immediately
   following the label at the bottom of stack, has a value of one, then
   this packet belongs to a G-ACh.  The first 32 bits following the
   bottom of stack label then have a defined format called an associated
   channel header (ACH), which further defines the content of the
   packet.  The ACH is therefore both a demultiplexer for G-ACh traffic
   on the PW, and a discriminator for the type of G-ACh traffic.

   When the OAM, or a similar message is carried over an LSP, rather
   than over a pseudowire, it is necessary to provide an indication in
   the packet that the payload is something other than a user data
   packet.  This is achieved by including a reserved label with a value
   of 13 in the label stack.  This reserved label is referred to as the
   'Generic Alert Label (GAL)', and is defined in [RFC5586].  When a GAL
   is found anywhere within the label stack it indicates that the
   payload begins with an ACH.  The GAL is thus a demultiplexer for
   G-ACh traffic on the LSP, and the ACH is a discriminator for the type
   of traffic carried on the G-ACh.  Note however that MPLS-TP
   forwarding follows the normal MPLS model, and that a GAL is invisible
   to an LSR unless it is the top label in the label stack.  The only
   other circumstance under which the label stack may be inspected for a
   GAL is when the TTL has expired.  Any MPLS-TP component that
   intentionally performs this inspection must assume that it is
   asynchronous with respect to the forwarding of other packets.  All
   operations on the label stack are in accordance with [RFC3031] and
   [RFC3032].

   In MPLS-TP, the 'Generic Alert Label (GAL)' always appears at the
   bottom of the label stack (i.e.  S bit set to 1), however this does
   not preclude its use elsewhere in the label stack in other
   applications.

   The G-ACH MUST only be used for channels that are an adjunct to the
   data service.  Examples of these are OAM, APS, MCC and SCC, but the
   use is not restricted to those names services.  The G-ACH MUST NOT be
   used to carry additional data for use in the forwarding path, i.e. it
   MUST NOT be used as an alternative to a PW control word, or to define
   a PW type.

   Since the G-ACh traffic is indistinguishable from the user data
   traffic at the server layer, bandwidth and QoS commitments apply to
   the gross traffic on the LSP, PW or section.  Protocols using the
   G-ACh must therefore take into consideration the impact they have on
   the user data that they are sharing resources with.  In addition,
   protocols using the G-ACh MUST conform to the security and congestion

3.8.  Control Plane

   MPLS-TP should be capable of being operated with centralized Network
   Management Systems (NMS).  The NMS may be supported by a distributed
   control plane, but MPLS-TP can operated in the absence of such a
   control plane.  A distributed control plane may be used to enable
   dynamic service provisioning in multi-vendor and multi-domain
   environments using standardized protocols that guarantee
   interoperability.  Where the requirements specified in [RFC5654] can
   be met, the MPLS transport profile uses existing control plane
   protocols for LSPs and PWs.

   Figure 14 illustrates the relationship between the MPLS-TP control
   plane, the forwarding plane, the management plane, and OAM for point-
   to-point MPLS-TP LSPs or PWs.

   Note:
      1) NMS may be centralised or distributed. Control plane is
         distributed
      2) 'Edge' functions refers to those functions present at
         the edge of a PSN domain, e.g. NSP or classification.
      3) The control plane may be transported over the server
         layer, and LSP or a G-ACh.


           Figure 14: MPLS-TP Control Plane Architecture Context

   The MPLS-TP control plane is based on a combination of the LDP-based
   control plane for pseudowires [RFC4447] and the RSVP-TE based control
   plane for MPLS-TP LSPs [RFC3471].  Some of the RSVP-TE functions that
   are required for LSP signaling for MPLS-TP are based on GMPLS.

   The distributed MPLS-TP control plane provides the following
   functions:

   o  Signaling

   o  Routing

   o  Traffic engineering and constraint-based path computation

   In a multi-domain environment, the MPLS-TP control plane supports
   different types of interfaces at domain boundaries or within the
   domains.  These include the User-Network Interface (UNI), Internal
   Network Node Interface (I-NNI), and External Network Node Interface



Bocci, et al.            Expires April 19, 2010                [Page 30]

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework               October 2009


   (E-NNI).  Note that different policies may be defined that control
   the information exchanged across these interface types.

   The MPLS-TP control plane is capable of activating MPLS-TP OAM
   functions as described in the OAM section of this document
   Section 3.6 e.g. for fault detection and localization in the event of
   a failure in order to efficiently restore failed transport paths.

   The MPLS-TP control plane supports all MPLS-TP data plane
   connectivity patterns that are needed for establishing transport
   paths including protected paths as described in the survivability
   section Section 3.10 of this document.  Examples of the MPLS-TP data
   plane connectivity patterns are LSPs utilizing the fast reroute
   backup methods as defined in [RFC4090] and ingress-to-egress 1+1 or
   1:1 protected LSPs.

   The MPLS-TP control plane provides functions to ensure its own
   survivability and to enable it to recover gracefully from failures
   and degradations.  These include graceful restart and hot redundant
   configurations.  Depending on how the control plane is transported,
   varying degrees of decoupling between the control plane and data
   plane may be achieved.

3.8.1.  PW Control Plane

   An MPLS-TP network provides many of its transport services using
   single-segment or multi-segment pseudowires, in compliance with the
   PWE3 architecture ([RFC3985] and [I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch] ).  The
   setup and maintenance of single-segment or multi- segment pseudowires
   uses the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) as per [RFC4447] and
   extensions for MS-PWs [I-D.ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw] and
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw].

3.8.2.   LSP Control Plane

   MPLS-TP provider edge nodes aggregate multiple pseudowires and carry
   them across the MPLS-TP network through MPLS-TP tunnels (MPLS-TP
   LSPs).  Applicable functions from the Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   protocol suite supporting packet-switched capable (PSC) technologies
   are used as the control plane for MPLS-TP transport paths (LSPs).

   The LSP control plane includes:

   o  RSVP-TE for signalling

   o  OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE for routing

   RSVP-TE signaling in support of GMPLS, as defined in [RFC3473], is



Bocci, et al.            Expires April 19, 2010                [Page 31]

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework               October 2009


   used for the setup, modification, and release of MPLS-TP transport
   paths and protection paths.  It supports unidirectional, bi-
   directional and multicast types of LSPs.  The route of a transport
   path is typically calculated in the ingress node of a domain and the
   RSVP explicit route object (ERO) is utilized for the setup of the
   transport path exactly following the given route.  GMPLS based
   MPLS-TP LSPs must be able to inter-operate with RSVP-TE based MPLS-TE
   LSPs, as per [RFC5146]

   OSPF-TE routing in support of GMPLS as defined in [RFC4203] is used
   for carrying link state information in a MPLS-TP network.  ISIS-TE
   routing in support of GMPLS as defined in [RFC5307] is used for
   carrying link state information in a MPLS-TP network.

3.9.  Static Operation of LSPs and PWs

   A PW or LSP may be statically configured without the support of a
   dynamic control plane.  This may be either by direct configuration of
   the PEs/LSRs, or via a network management system.  The collateral
   damage that loops can cause during the time taken to detect the
   failure may be severe.  When static configuration mechanisms are
   used, care must be taken to ensure that loops to not form.

3.10.  Survivability

   Survivability requirements for MPLS-TP are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk].

   A wide variety of resiliency schemes have been developed to meet the
   various network and service survivability objectives.  For example,
   as part of the MPLS/PW paradigms, MPLS provides methods for local
   repair using back-up LSP tunnels ([RFC4090]), while pseudowire
   redundancy [I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy] supports scenarios where the
   protection for the PW can not be fully provided by the PSN layer
   (i.e. where the backup PW terminates on a different target PE node
   than the working PW).  Additionally, GMPLS provides a well known set
   of control plane driven protection and restoration mechanisms
   [RFC4872].  MPLS-TP provides additional protection mechanisms that
   are optimised for both linear topologies and ring topologies, and
   that operate in the absence of a dynamic control plane.  These are
   specified in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk].

   Different protection schemes apply to different deployment topologies
   and operational considerations.  Such protection schemes may provide
   different levels of resiliency.  For example, two concurrent traffic
   paths (1+1), one active and one standby path with guaranteed
   bandwidth on both paths (1:1) or one active path and a standby path
   that is shared by one or more other active paths (shared protection).

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework               October 2009


   The applicability of any given scheme to meet specific requirements
   is outside the current scope of this document.

   The characteristics of MPLS-TP resiliency mechanisms are listed
   below.

   o  Optimised for linear, ring or meshed topologies.

   o  Use OAM mechanisms to detect and localize network faults or
      service degenerations.

   o  Include protection mechanisms to coordinate and trigger protection
      switching actions in the absence of a dynamic control plane.  This
      is known as an Automatic Protection Switching (APS) mechanism.

   o  MPLS-TP recovery schemes are applicable to all levels in the
      MPLS-TP domain (i.e.  MPLS section, LSP and PW), providing segment
      and end-to- end recovery.

   o  MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms support the coordination of protection
      switching at multiple levels to prevent race conditions occurring
      between a client and its server layer.

   o  MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms can be data plane, control plane or
      management plane based.

   o  MPLS-TP supports revertive and non-revertive behavior.

3.11.  Network Management

   The network management architecture and requirements for MPLS-TP are
   specified in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-req].  It derives from the generic
   specifications described in ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 [G.7710] for
   transport technologies.  It also incorporates the OAM requirements
   for MPLS Networks [RFC4377] and MPLS-TP Networks
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements] and expands on those requirements
   to cover the modifications necessary for fault, configuration,
   performance, and security in a transport network.

   The Equipment Management Function (EMF) of a MPLS-TP Network Element
   (NE) (i.e.  LSR, LER, PE, S-PE or T-PE) provides the means through
   which a management system manages the NE.  The Management
   Communication Channel (MCC), realized by the G-ACh, provides a
   logical operations channel between NEs for transferring Management
   information.  For the management interface from a management system
   to a MPLS-TP NE, there is no restriction on which management protocol
   should be used.  It is used to provision and manage an end-to-end
   connection across a network where some segments are create/managed,



Bocci, et al.            Expires April 19, 2010                [Page 33]

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework               October 2009


   for examples by Netconf or SNMP and other segments by XML or CORBA
   interfaces.  Maintenance operations are run on a connection (LSP or
   PW) in a manner that is independent of the provisioning mechanism.
   An MPLS-TP NE is not required to offer more than one standard
   management interface.  In MPLS-TP, the EMF must be capable of
   statically provisioning LSPs for an LSR or LER, and PWs for a PE, as
   per Section 3.9.

   Fault Management (FM) functions within the EMF of an MPLS-TP NE
   enable the supervision, detection, validation, isolation, correction,
   and alarm handling of abnormal conditions in the MPLS-TP network and
   its environment.  FM must provide for the supervision of transmission
   (such as continuity, connectivity, etc.), software processing,
   hardware, and environment.  Alarm handling includes alarm severity
   assignment, alarm suppression/aggregation/correlation, alarm
   reporting control, and alarm reporting.

   Configuration Management (CM) provides functions to control,
   identify, collect data from, and provide data to MPLS-TP NEs.  In
   addition to general configuration for hardware, software protection
   switching, alarm reporting control, and date/time setting, the EMF of
   the MPLS-TP NE also supports the configuration of maintenance entity
   identifiers (such as MEP ID and MIP ID).  The EMF also supports the
   configuration of OAM parameters as a part of connectivity management
   to meet specific operational requirements.  These may specify whether
   the operational mode is one-time on-demand or is periodic at a
   specified frequency.

   The Performance Management (PM) functions within the EMF of an MPLS-
   TP NE support the evaluation and reporting of the behaviour of the
   NEs and the network.  One particular requirement for PM is to provide
   coherent and consistent interpretation of the network behaviour in a
   hybrid network that uses multiple transport technologies.  Packet
   loss measurement and delay measurements may be collected and used to
   detect performance degradation.  This is reported via fault
   management to enable corrective actions to be taken (e.g.  Protection
   switching), and via performance monitoring for Service Level
   Agreement (SLA) verification and billing.  Collection mechanisms for
   performance data should be should be capable of operating on-demand
   or proactively.

4.  Security Considerations

   The introduction of MPLS-TP into transport networks means that the
   security considerations applicable to both MPLS and PWE3 apply to
   those transport networks.  Furthermore, when general MPLS networks
   that utilise functionality outside of the strict MPLS-TP profile are
   used to support packet transport services, the security



Bocci, et al.            Expires April 19, 2010                [Page 34]

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework               October 2009


   considerations of that additional functionality also apply.

   For pseudowires, the security considerations of [RFC3985] and
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch] apply.

   Packets that arrive on an interface with a given label value should
   not be forwarded unless that label value was previously assigned to
   an LSP or PW to a peer LSR or PE that it reachable via that
   interface.

   Each MPLS-TP solution must specify the additional security
   considerations that apply.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA considerations resulting from specific elements of MPLS-TP
   functionality will be detailed in the documents specifying that
   functionality.

   This document introduces no additional IANA considerations in itself.

7.  Open Issues

   This section contains a list of issues that must be resolved before
   last call.

   o  Add addition detail on survivability architectures.

   o  Consider whether there is too much detail in the OAM, network
      management, identifiers and control plane sections.  Should this
      framework document reduce the discussion on these topics in order
      to minimise the dependency on other components not yet ready for
      publication.

   o  There is some text missing from the network layer clients section.
      Text is invited covering the use of out of band signaling on the
      AC.

   o  Need text to address how the LSR next hop MAC address is
      determined for Ethernet link layers when no IP (i.e.  ARP) is
      available.  If statically configured, what is the default?

   o  Are there any other invariants of a typical LSR/PE architecture
      that need to be clarified in the context of MPLS-TP.
