Internet-Draft     P-Charge-Info, a SIP Private Header     February 2008


1.  Overview

   In certain network configurations, it is desirable to decouple the
   Caller ID from the number used for billing purposes.  This document
   describes the current usage of 'P-Charge-Info', a private SIP header,
   to provide simple billing information and requests the registration
   of this header with IANA as required by section 4.1 of RFC 3427
   [RFC3427].

   In a typical configuration, "Caller ID" is derived from one of the
   following SIP headers:

   o  P-Asserted-Identity

   o  From (in the absence of P-Asserted-Identity)

   (NOTE: Some service providers today also use the "Remote-Party-ID"
   header but this was replaced by P-Asserted-Identity in RFC 3325 and
   should no longer be used.)

   This number is typically presented to the receiving UA where it is
   usually displayed for the end user.  It is also typically used for
   billing purposes by the network entities involved in carrying the
   session.

   However, in a distributed environment the "Caller ID" presented to
   the receiving UA may not reflect the actual reality of the underlying
   network in terms of costs incurred on the PSTN.  This may result in
   excessive charging of one carrier by another based on the erroneous
   assumption that the call was originating from a different point on
   the PSTN.

   There exists a need for a way to pass an additional billing
   identifier that can be used between network entities in order to
   correctly bill for services.  At least one equipment provider, Sonus
   Networks, and several carriers have been using the "P-Charge-Info"
   header for the last 2-3 years as a simple mechanism to exchange this
   billing identifier.

   Note that the 3GPP has also recognized the need for such a billing
   identifier and in section 4.6 of RFC 3455 [RFC3455] established a SIP
   P-Header, "P-Charging-Vector", to provide similar information.  There
   are, however, some differences in the semantics associated with
   P-Charging-Vector and P-Charge-Info.  P-Charging-Vector is mainly
   used to carry information for correlation of multiple charging
   records generated for a single session.  On the other hand, P-Charge-
   Info is used to convey information about the party to be billed for a
   call.  Furthermore, P-Charging-Vector has a mandatory icid-value

   parameter, which is a globally unique value to identify the session,
   for which the charging information is generated.  Such an identifier
   is not necessary when carrying information about the user to be
   billed.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


3.  The P-Charge-Info Header

3.1.  Applicability Statement for the P-Charge-Info header

   The P-Charge-Info header is applicable within a single private
   administrative domain or between different administrative domains
   where there is a trust relationship between the domains.

3.2.  Usage of the P-Charge-Info header

   The P-Charge-Info header is used to convey information related to
   billing record for a particular call.  The P-Charge-Info header is
   typically inserted by the SIP proxy on the originating network.

3.2.1.  Procedures at the UA

   The P-Charge-Info header may be inserted by PSTN gateways acting as a
   SIP UA, either through local policy or as a result of information
   received via PSTN signaling, e.g. the charge parameter in an ISUP IAM
   message.

   The P-Charge-Info header is not used/interpreted by a regular (i.e.
   non-gateway) UA and should not normally be seen by such a UA.  If the
   header is transmitted to such a UA, the UA should ignore the header.

3.2.2.  Procedures at the Proxy

   A SIP proxy that supports this extension and receives a request,
   typically a SIP INVITE, without the P-Charge-Info header MAY insert a
   P-Charge-Info header.  The contents of the inserted header may be
   decided based on local policy or by querying an external entity.

   A SIP proxy that does not support this extension will pass any
   received P-Charge-Info header unmodified in compliance with RFC 3261.

Internet-Draft     P-Charge-Info, a SIP Private Header     February 2008


3.3.  Examples of Usage

   The content of the P-Charge-Info header is typically simply a SIP URI
   used as a billing indicator.  As such, an example would be as simple
   as:

   P-Charge-Info: <sip:4075555555@1.2.3.4>

   Any other applicable SIP URI could be used.

   P-Charge-Info optionally includes the numbering plan indicator as an
   additional parameter.  This is used when an ISUP message is built
   from a SIP message for scenarios where SIP is used to connect two
   PSTN segments and needs to pass charging information between them.
   An example of the usage of the optional header is:

   P-Charge-Info: <sip:6835555555;npi=ISDN@10.10.7.21>


4.  Formal Syntax

   The Private Header specified in this document is described in both
   prose and an augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) defined in RFC 2234.
   Further, several BNF definitions are inherited from SIP and are not
   repeated here.  Implementors need to be familiar with the notation
   and contents of SIP [1] and RFC 2234 [3] to understand this document.

   The syntax of the P-Charge-Info header is described as follows:

         P-Charge-Info = "P-Charge-Info" HCOLON (name-addr / addr-spec)*
                 (SEMI charge-param)
                 ; name-addr and addr-spec are specified in RFC 3261
             charge-param = (("npi" EQUAL npi-value) / generic-param)
                 ; generic-param is specifed in RFC 3261
             npi-value = ("ISDN" / "DATA" / "TELEX" / "PRIVATE" /
                    "SPARE0" / "SPARE1" / "SPARE2" / "SPARE3" /
                    "SPARE4" / "SPARE5" / "SPARE6" / "SPARE7" )


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a private SIP extension header field (beginning
   with the prefixe "P-").

   The extension is registered as a private extension field:

   RFC Number: RFCXXXX [Note to IANA: Please fill in with the RFC number
   of this specification.

Internet-Draft     P-Charge-Info, a SIP Private Header     February 2008


   Header Field Name: P-Charge-Info

   Compact Form: none


6.  Security Considerations

   Given that the information contained in the P-Charge-Info header will
   be used for billing purposes the proxies that share this information
   MUST have a trust relationship.

   If an untrusted entity were inserted between the trusted entities, it
   could potentially interfere with the billing records for the call.
   If the SIP connections are not made over a private WAN, a mechanism
   for securing the confidentiality and integrity of the SIP connection
   should be used to protect the information.


7.  Acknowledgements

   The authors thank Miguel Garcia, Christer Holmberg and Paul Kyzivat,
   who, while not necessarily agreeing with the need for this header,
   did provide substantial input and also corrected and greatly improved
   the ABNF notation.
