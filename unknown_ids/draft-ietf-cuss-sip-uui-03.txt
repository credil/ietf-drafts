 A Mechanism for Transporting User to User Call Control Information in
                                  SIP
                       draft-ietf-cuss-sip-uui-03

Abstract

   There is a need for applications using SIP to exchange User to User
   Information (UUI) data during session establishment.  This
   information, known as call control UUI data, is a small piece of data
   inserted by an application initiating the session, and utilized by an
   application accepting the session.  Applications define a UUI package
   for the transport of their UUI data.  This data is opaque to SIP and
   its function is unrelated to any basic SIP function.  This document
   defines a new SIP header field, User-to-User, to transport UUI data,
   along with an extension mechanism.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2011


1.  Overview

   This document describes the transport of User to User Information
   (UUI) data using SIP [RFC3261].  Specifically, we discuss a mechanism
   for the transport of general application UUI data and also for the
   transport of call control related ITU-T Q.931 User to User
   Information Element (UU IE) [Q931] and ITU-T Q.763 User to User
   Information Parameter [Q763] data in SIP.  UUI data is widely used in
   the PSTN today in contact centers and call centers which are
   transitioning away from ISDN to SIP.  This extension will also be
   used for native SIP endpoints implementing similar services and
   interworking with ISDN services.  Note that in most cases, there is
   an a priori understanding between the endpoints in regard to what to
   do with received UUI data.

   This mechanism was designed to meet the use cases, requirements, and
   call flows for SIP call control UUI detailed in
   [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].  All references to requirement numbers
   (REQ-N) and figure numbers refer to this document.

   The mechanism chosen is a new SIP header field, along with a new SIP
   option tag.  The header field carries the UUI data, along with
   parameters indicating the encoding of the UUI data, the UUI package,
   and optionally the content of the UUI data.  The package definition
   contains details about how a particular application can utilize the
   UUI mechanism.  The header field can be escaped into URIs supporting
   referral and redirection scenarios.  In these scenarios, History-Info
   is used to indicate the inserter of the UUI data.  The SIP option tag
   can be used to indicate support for the header field.  Support for
   the header field indicates that a UA is able to extract the
   information in the UUI data and pass it up the protocol stack.
   Individual packages using the UUI mechanism can utlize SIP media
   feature tags to indicate that a UA supports a particular UUI package.
   Guidelines for defining UUI packages are provided.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements Discussion

   This section describes how the User-to-User header field meets the
   requirements in [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].  The header field can



Johnston & Rafferty      Expires April 25, 2012                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2011


   be included in INVITE requests and responses and BYE requests and
   responses, meeting REQ-1 and REQ-2.

   For redirection and referral use cases and REQ-3, the header field
   would be escaped into the Contact or Refer-To URI.  Currently, UAs
   that support attended transfer support the ability to escape a
   Replaces header field into a Refer-To URI, and when acting upon this
   URI add the Replaces header field to the triggered INVITE.  This
   logic and behavior is identical for the UUI header field.  The UA
   processing the REFER or the 3xx to the INVITE will need to support
   the UUI mechanism, as UAs in general do not process unknown escaped
   header fields.

   Since SIP proxy forwarding and retargeting does not affect header
   fields, the header field meets REQ-4.

   The UUI header field will carry the UUI data and not a pointer to the
   data, so REQ-5 is met.

   Since the basic design of the UUI header field is similar to the ISDN
   UUI service, interworking with PSTN protocols will be straightforward
   and will be documented in a separate specification, meeting REQ-6.

   Requirements REQ-7, REQ-8, and REQ-10 relate to discovery of the
   mechanism and supported packages, and hence applications.  REQ-7
   relates to support of the UUI header field, while REQ-8 relates to
   routing based on support of the UUI header field.  REQ-7 is met by
   defining a new SIP option tag 'uui'.  The use of a Require:uui in a
   request, or Supported:uui in an OPTIONS response could be used to
   require or discover support of the mechanism.  The presence of a
   Supported:uui or Require:uui header field can be used by proxies to
   route to an appropriate UA, meeting REQ-8.  However, note that the
   only endpoints are expected to understand the UUI data - proxies and
   other intermediaries do not.  REQ-10 is met by utlizing SIP feature
   tags [RFC3840].  For example, the feature tag 'sip.uui-isdn' could be
   used to indicate support of the ISDN UUI package, or 'sip.uui-pk1'
   could be used to indicate support for a particular package, pk1.

   Proxies commonly apply policy to the presence of certain SIP header
   fields in requests by either passing them or removing them from
   requests.  REQ-9 is met by allowing proxies and other intermediaries
   to remove UUI header fields in a request or response based on policy.

   Carrying UUI data elements of at least 129 octets is trivial in the
   UUI header field, meeting REQ-11.  Note that very large UUI data
   elements should be avoided, as SIP header fields have traditionally
   not been large.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2011


   To meet REQ-12 in redirection and referral use cases, History-Info
   [I-D.ietf-sipcore-rfc4244bis] can be used.  In these retargeting
   cases, the changed Request-URI will be recorded in the History-Info
   header field along with the identity of the element that performed
   the retargeting.

   The requirement for integrity protection in REQ-13 could be met by
   the use of an S/MIME signature over a subset of header fields, as
   defined in Section 23.4 of RFC 3261 "SIP Header Privacy and Integrity
   using S/MIME: Tunneling SIP".  The requirement of REQ-14 for end-to-
   end privacy could be met using S/MIME or using encryption at the
   application layer.  Note that the use of S/MIME to secure the UUI
   data will result in an additional body being added to the request.
   Hopwise TLS allows the header field to meet REQ-15 for hop-by-hop
   security.


4.  Normative Definition

   This document defines a new SIP header field "User-to-User" to
   transport call control UUI data to meet the requirements in
   [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].

   To help tag and identify the UUI data used with this header field,
   "package", "content", and "encoding" parameters are defined.  The
   "package" parameter identifies the package which defines the
   generation and usage of the UUI data for a particular application.
   For the case of interworking with the ISDN UUI Service, the ISDN UUI
   Service interworking package is used.  If the "package" parameter is
   not present, interworking with the ISDN UUI Service MUST be assumed.
   The "content" parameter identifies the actual content of the UUI
   data.  If not present, the content MUST be assumed to be unknown as
   it is in the ISDN UUI Service.  Newly defined UUI packages MUST
   define a new "content" value.  The "encoding" parameter indicates the
   method of encoding the information in the UUI data.  This
   specification only defines "encoding=hex".  If the "encoding"
   parameter is not present, "hex" MUST be assumed.

   UUI data is considered an opaque series of octets.  This mechanism
   SHOULD NOT be used to convey a URL or URI: the Call-Info header field
   [RFC3261] is used for this purpose.

4.1.  Syntax for UUI Header Field

   The User-to-User header field can be present in INVITE requests and
   responses only and in BYE requests and responses.  Note that only
   end-to-end responses can be used, e.g. 1xx (excluding 100), 2xx, and
   3xx responses.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2011


   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC 5234 and extends RFC 3261.

        UUI         = "User-to-User" HCOLON uui-data *(SEMI uui-param)
        uui-data    = token / quoted-string
        uui-param   = pkg-param / cont-param / enc-param / generic-param
        pkg-param   = "package" EQUAL token
        cont-param  = "content" EQUAL token
        enc-param   = "encoding" EQUAL ("hex" / token)

   A single User-to-User header field may be present in a request or a
   response.  Any size limitations on the UUI data for a particular
   purpose must be defined by a UUI package.

4.2.  Source Identity of UUI data

   It is important for the recipient of UUI data to know the identity of
   the UA that inserted the UUI data.  In a request without a History-
   Info [I-D.ietf-sipcore-rfc4244bis] header field, the inserter of the
   UUI data will be assumed to be the identity of the source of the SIP
   message.  For a SIP request, typically this is the UA identified by
   the URI in the From header field or a P-Asserted-Identity [RFC3325]
   header field.  In a request with a History-Info header field, the
   recipient needs to parse the Targeted-to-URIs present (hi-targeted-
   to-uri) to see if any escaped User-to-User header fields are present.
   If an escaped User-to-User header field is present and matches the
   UUI data in the request, it indicates that redirection has taken
   place which has resulted in the UUI data inclusion in the request.
   The inserter of the UUI data will be the UA identified by the
   Targeted-to-URI of the History-Info element prior to the element with
   the escaped UUI data.  In a response, the inserter of the UUI data
   will be the identity of the UA that generated the response.
   Typically, this is the UA identified in the To header field of the
   response.  Note that any updates to this identity by use of the SIP
   Connected Identity extension [RFC4916] or others will update this
   information.

   For an example of History-Info and redirection, consider Figure 2
   from [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs] where the Originating UA is Carol,
   the Redirector Bob, and the Terminating UA Alice.  The INVITE F4
   containing UUI data could be:

   INVITE sips:alice@example.com SIP/2.0
   Via: SIP/2.0/TLS lab.example.com:5061
    ;branch=z9hG4bKnashds9
   To: Bob <sips:bob@example.com>
   From: Carol <sips:carol@example.com>;tag=323sf33k2
   Call-ID: dfaosidfoiwe83ifkdf
   Max-Forwards: 70
   Contact: <sips:carol@lab.example.com>
   Supported: histinfo
   User-to-User: 342342ef34;encoding=hex
   History-Info: <sips:bob@example.com>;index=1
   <allOneLine>
   History-Info: <sips:alice@example.com?Reason=SIP%3Bcause%3D302
      &User-to-User=342342ef34%3Bencoding%3Dhex>;index=1.1;rc=1
   </allOneLine>

   Without the redirection captured in the History-Info, Alice would
   conclude the UUI data was inserted by Carol.  However, the History-
   Info containing UUI data (index=1.1) indicates that the inserter was
   Bob (index=1).

   Note that the <allOneLine> tag convention from SIP  Torture Test
   Messages [RFC4475] is used to show that there are no line breaks in
   the actual message syntax.

   To enable the inserter identity of UUI data, UAs supporting this
   mechanism SHOULD support History-Info [I-D.ietf-sipcore-rfc4244bis]
   and include Supported: histinfo in all requests and responses.


5.  Guidelines for UUI Packages

   UUI packages defined using this SIP UUI mechanism must publish a
   standards track RFC which describes the usage.  Note that this
   mechanism is not suitable for the transport of arbitrary data between
   endpoints.  The following guidelines are provided to help determine
   if this mechanism is appropriate or some other SIP mechanism should
   be used.  The SIP UUI mechanism is applicable in the following
   situations:

      1.  The information is generated and consumed by an application
      during session setup using SIP, but the application is not
      necessarily SIP aware.

      2.  The behavior of SIP entities that support it is not
      significantly changed (as discussed in Section 4 of [RFC5727]).

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2011


      3.  User Agent Clients (UAC) and User Agent Servers (UAS) are the
      generators and consumers of the UUI data.  Proxies may route based
      on the presence of a User-to-User header field or a particular
      package tag but not otherwise be involved.

      4.  Intermediary elements or proxies can remove or insert UUI data

   This mechanism is not applicable in the following situations:

      1.  The behavior of SIP entities that support it is significantly
      changed (as discussed in Section 4 of [RFC5727]).

      2.  The information is generated and consumed at the SIP layer by
      SIP elements.

      3.  SIP elements besides the UAC and UAS might be interested in
      consuming (beyond adding or removing) the information.

      4.  There are specific privacy issues involved with the
      information being transported (e.g., geolocation or emergency-
      related information).

      5.  The UUI data is a user-to-user Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
      mechanism.

   This specification defines only the value of "hex" for the "encoding"
   parameter.  New values can be defined and added to the IANA registry
   with a standards track RFC, which needs to discuss the issues in this
   section.

   New "encoding" values must reference a common encoding scheme or
   define the exact new encoding scheme.

   New "content" values must describe the content of the UUI data and
   give some example use cases.  The default "encoding" and other
   allowed encoding methods must be defined for this new content.

   New "package" values must describe the new application which is
   utilizing the UUI data and give some example use cases.  The default
   "content" value and other allowed contents must be defined for the
   package.  Any restrictions on the size of the UUI data must be
   described.  In addition, a package may define a Media Feature tag per
   RFC 3840 [RFC3840] to indicate support for this UUI package.  For
   example, the media feature tag sip.uui-pk1 could be defined to
   indicate support for a UUI package named pk1.  The definition of a
   new SIP option tag solely to identify support for a UUI package is
   NOT RECOMMENDED unless there are additional SIP behaviors needed to
   implement this feature.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2011


6.6.  Registration of SIP Option Tag

   This specification registers a new SIP option tag, as per the
   guidelines in Section 27.1 of [RFC3261].

   This document defines the SIP option tag "uui".

   The following row has been added to the "Option Tags" section of the
   SIP Parameter Registry:

   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | Name       | Description                              | Reference |
   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | uui        | This option tag is used to indicate that | [RFCXXXX] |
   |            | a UA supports and understands the        |           |
   |            | User-to-User header field.               |           |
   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   this document.


7.  Security Considerations

   User to user information can potentially carry sensitive information
   that might require privacy or integrity protection.  Standard
   deployed SIP security mechanisms such as TLS transport, offer these
   properties on a hop-by-hop basis.  To preserve multi-hop or end-to-
   end confidentiality and integrity of UUI data, approaches using
   S/MIME can be used, as discussed in the draft.  However, the lack of
   deployment of these mechanisms means that applications can not in
   general rely on them.  As such, applications are encouraged to
   utilize their own security mechanisms.


8.  Appendix - Other Possible Mechanisms

   Two other possible mechanisms for transporting UUI data will be
   described: MIME body and URI parameter transport.

8.1.  Why INFO is Not Used

   Since the INFO method [RFC6086], was developed for ISUP interworking
   of user-to-user information, it might seem to be the logical choice
   here.  For non-call control user-to-user information, INFO can be
   utilized for end to end transport.  However, for transport of call
   control user-to-user information, INFO can not be used.  As the call
   flows in [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs] show, the information is

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2011


   related to an attempt to establish a session and must be passed with
   the session setup request (INVITE), responses to that INVITE, or
   session termination requests.  As a result, it is not possible to use
   INFO in these cases.

8.2.  Why Other Protocol Encapsulation UUI Mechanisms are Not Used

   Other protocols have the ability to transport UUI data.  For example,
   consider the ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information Element (UU IE)
   [Q931] and the ITU-T Q.763 User to User Information Parameter [Q763].
   In addition, NSS (Narrowband Signaling System) [Q1980] is also able
   to transport UUI data.  Should one of these protocols be in use, and
   present in both User Agents, then utilizing these other protocols to
   transport UUI data might be a logical solution.  Essentially, this is
   just adding an additional layer in the protocol stack.  In these
   cases, SIP is not transporting the UUI data; it is encapsulating
   another protocol, and that protocol is transporting the UUI data.
   Once a mechanism to transport that other protocol using SIP exists,
   the UUI data transport function is essentially obtained without any
   additional effort or work.

   However, the authors believe that SIP needs to have its own native
   UUI data transport mechanism.  It is not reasonable for a SIP UA to
   have to implement another entire protocol (either ISDN or NSS, for
   example) just to get the very simple UUI data transport service.  Of
   course, this work does not preclude anyone from using other protocols
   with SIP to transport UUI data.

8.3.  MIME body Approach

   One method of transport is to use a MIME body.  This is in keeping
   with the SIP-T architecture [RFC3372] in which MIME bodies are used
   to transport ISUP information.  Since the INVITE will normally have
   an SDP message body, the resulting INVITE with SDP and UUI data will
   be multipart MIME.  This is not ideal as many SIP UAs do not support
   multipart MIME INVITEs.

   A bigger problem is the insertion of a UUI message body by a redirect
   server or in a REFER.  The body would need to be encoded in the
   Contact URI of the 3xx response or the Refer-To URI of a REFER.
   Currently, the authors are not aware of any UAs that support this
   capability today for any body type.  As such, the complete set of
   semantics for this operation would need to be determined and defined.
   Some issues will need to be resolved, such as, do all the Content-*
   header fields have to be escaped as well?  And, what if the escaped
   Content-Length does not agree with the escaped body?

   Since proxies cannot remove a body from a request or response, it is

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2011


   not at all clear how this mechanism could meet REQ-9.

   The requirement for integrity protection could be met by the use of
   an S/MIME signature over the body, as defined in Section 23.3 of RFC
   3261 "Securing MIME bodies".  Alternatively, this could be achieved
   using RFC 4474 [RFC4474].  The requirement for end-to-end privacy
   could be met using S/MIME encryption or using encryption at the
   application layer.  However, note that neither S/MIME or RFC 4474
   enjoys deployment in SIP today.

   An example:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?Content-Type=
   application/uui&body=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
   </allOneLine>

   As such, the MIME body approach meets REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-4, REQ-5,
   REQ-7, REQ-11, REQ-13, and REQ-14.  Meeting REQ-12 seems possible,
   although the authors do not have a specific mechanism to propose.
   Meeting REQ-3 is problematic, but not impossible for this mechanism.
   However, this mechanism does not seem to be able to meet REQ-9.

8.4.  URI Parameter

   Another proposed approach is to encode the UUI data as a URI
   parameter.  This UUI parameter could be included in a Request-URI or
   in the Contact URI or Refer-To URI.  It is not clear how it could be
   transported in a responses which does not have a Request-URI, or in
   BYE requests or responses.

  <allOneLine>
  Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com;uui=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6
  F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
  </allOneLine>

   An INVITE sent to this Contact URI would contain UUI data in the
   Request-URI of the INVITE.  The URI parameter has a drawback in that
   a URI parameter carried in a Request-URI will not survive retargeting
   by a proxy as shown in Figure 2 of [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].
   That is, if the URI is included with an Address of Record instead of
   a Contact URI, the URI parameter in the Reqeuest-URI will not be
   copied over to the Contact URI, resulting in the loss of the
   information.  Note that if this same URI was present in a Refer-To
   header field, the same loss of information would occur.

   The URI parameter approach would meet REQ-3, REQ-5, REQ-7, REQ-9, and
   REQ-11.  It is possible the approach could meet REQ-12 and REQ-13.

   The mechanism does not appear to meet REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-4, and
   REQ-14.
