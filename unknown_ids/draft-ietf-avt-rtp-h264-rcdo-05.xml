  <abstract>
   <t>This document describes an RTP Payload format for the Reduced-Complexity Decoding Operation (RCDO) for H.264 Baseline profile bitstreams, as specified in ITU-T Recommendation H.241. RCDO reduces the decoding cost and resource consumption of the video processing. The RCDO RTP Payload format is based on the H.264 RTP Payload format.</t>

  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
   <t>ITU-T Recommendation H.241 <xref target="ITU.H241.2006"/> specifies a reduced-complexity decoding operation (RCDO) for use with H.264 <xref target="ITU.H264.2007"/> Baseline profile bitstreams. It also specifies a bitstream constraint associated with RCDO and a mechanism for signalling RCDO within the bitstream. The RCDO signalling indicates that the bitstream conforms to the bitstream constraint and that the decoder shall apply the RCDO decoding process to the bitstream.</t>
   <t>RCDO for H.264 offers a solution to support higher resolutions at the same high framerates used in current implementations. This is achieved by reducing the processing requirements and thus the decoding cost/resource consumption of the video processing.</t>
   <!-- This section used in the initial drafts, not suitable for RFC style probably.
   <t>ITU-T H.264 <xref target="ITU.H264.2007"/> and ITU-T H.241 <xref target="ITU.H241.2006"/>, its associated video procedures and signalling recommendation, continue to evolve. The IETF RTP payload formats and parameters need to be updated to include important new functionalities not covered in RFC3984bis <xref target="I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-rfc3984bis"/>. The RCDO approach is already addressed in the latest version of H.241 <xref target="ITU.H241.2006"/>. This proposal defines media subtype parameters, a new H.264 media subtype for RCDO and allows use in SDP.</t>

  <section anchor="mfback" title="Media Format Background">
   <t>The Reduced-Complexity Decoding Operation (RCDO) for H.264 Baseline profile bitstreams is specified in Annex B of H.241 <xref target="ITU.H241.2006"/>. RCDO is specified as a separate H.264 mode, and is distinct from any profile defined in H.264.  An RCDO bitstream obey to all the constraints of the Baseline profile. </t>

   <t>The media format is based on the H.264 RTP Payload format as specified in RFC3984bis <xref target="I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-rfc3984bis"/>. Therefore, RFC3984bis constitutes the basis for this document and is referred to several times.</t>
   <t>In order to signal H.264 additional modes, Table 9f of H.241 <xref target="ITU.H241.2006"/> specifies an AdditionalModesSupported parameter. Currently, the only additional mode defined is RCDO. </t>
     <t><list style="empty">
      <t>Informative note: Other additional modes may be defined in the future. H.264 additional modes may or may not be distinct from the Profiles in H.264.</t>
     </list></t>
   <t>A separate media subtype, named H264-RCDO, is defined to ensure backward compatibility with deployed implementations of H.264.</t>
  </section>


  <section anchor="pf" title="Payload Format">
   <t>The payload format defined in Section 5 of RFC3984bis <xref target="I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-rfc3984bis"/> SHALL be used. This includes the RTP header usage and the payload format in RFC3984bis. Examples of typical RTP packets can be found in RFC3984bis.</t>
  </section>


  <section title="Congestion Control Considerations">
   <!-- Initial text from rtp-howto. Modified slightly. -->
   <t>Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance with RFC 3550 <xref target="RFC3550"/>, and with any applicable RTP profile; e.g., RFC 3551 <xref target="RFC3551"/>.  If best-effort service is being used, users of this payload format SHALL monitor packet loss to ensure that the packet loss rate is within acceptable parameters. </t>
  </section>


  <section title="Payload Format Parameters">
   <t>This RTP payload format is identified using the H264-RCDO media subtype which is registered in accordance with RFC 4855 <xref target="RFC4855"/> and using the template of RFC 4288 <xref target="RFC4288"/>.</t>

     <t>Informative note: The media subtype definition for H264-RCDO is based on the definition of the H264 media subtype as specified in Section 8.1 of RFC3984bis <xref target="I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-rfc3984bis"/>. Except for the profile-level-id parameter where new semantics are specified below, the optional parameters are copied verbatim from RFC3984bis <xref target="I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-rfc3984bis"/> for completeness in the IANA registration.</t>

Note that reserved_zero_4bits is required to be equal to 0 in H.264 <xref target="ITU.H264.2007"/>, but other values for it may be specified in the future by ITU-T or ISO/IEC. <!-- RFC3984bis copy end --></t>
      <t></t>
      <t><!-- RFC3984bis copy start -->The profile-level-id parameter indicates the default sub-profile, i.e. the subset of coding tools that may have been used to generate the stream or that the receiver supports, and the default level of the stream or the receiver supports.<!-- RFC3984bis copy end --></t>
      <t></t>
      <t>RCDO is distinct from any profile, this implies that the profile value 0 (no profile) and the profile_idc byte of the profile-level-id parameter are equal to 0. An RCDO bitstream MUST obey to all the constraints of the Baseline profile. Therefore, only constraint_set0_flag is equal to 1 in the profile-iop part of the profile-level-id parameter, the remaining bits are set to 0.</t>
      <!-- TK: We may have to bother about level 1b - constraint_set3_flag == 1. It aplies to Baseline profile, on which RCDO is based. We'll see. Skip sub-profile explanation/table/examples for now. -->

      <t><!-- RFC3984bis copy start -->If the profile-level-id parameter is used to indicate properties of a NAL unit stream, it indicates that, to decode the stream, the lowest level the decoder has to support is the default level.<!-- RFC3984bis copy end --></t>

      <t><!-- RFC3984bis copy start -->If the profile-level-id parameter is used for capability exchange or session setup procedure, and if max-recv-level is not present, the default level from profile-level-id indicates the highest level the codec wishes to support.

For either receiving or sending, all levels that are lower than the highest level supported MUST also be supported. <!-- RFC3984bis copy end --></t>
      <t></t>
      <t>For example, if a codec supports level 1.3, the profile-level-id becomes 00800d, in which 00 indicates the "no profile" value, 80 indicates the constraints of the Baseline profile and 0d indicates level 1.3. When level 2.1 is supported, the profile-level-id becomes 008015.</t>

      <t>If no profile-level-id is present, level 1 MUST be implied, i.e. equivalent to profile-level-id 00800a.</t>

          simultaneously.  For example, if both max-mbps and max-br are
          present, the signaled highest level with the extension of
          both the frame rate and bit rate is supported.  That is, the

             The coded picture buffer need not be implemented in

          parameter is the maximum value of (decoding time of the NAL
          unit - transmission time of a NAL unit), assuming reliable
          and instantaneous transmission, the same timeline for
          transmission and decoding, and that decoding starts when the
          first packet arrives.</t>
          <t></t>
          <t>An example of specifying the value of sprop-init-buf-time
          follows.  A NAL unit stream is sent in the following
          interleaved order, in which the value corresponds to the
          decoding time and the transmission order is from left to
          right:</t>
             <t><list style="empty"><t>0  2  1  3  5  4  6  8  7 ...</t></list></t>
          <t></t>
          <t>Assuming a steady transmission rate of NAL units, the
          transmission times are:</t>
             <t><list style="empty"><t>0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 ...</t></list></t>
          <t></t>
          <t>Subtracting the decoding time from the transmission time
          column-wise results in the following series:</t>
             <t><list style="empty"><t>0 -1  1  0 -1  1  0 -1  1 ...</t></list></t>
          <t></t>
          <t>Thus, in terms of intervals of NAL unit transmission times,
          the value of sprop-init-buf-time in this example is 1.  The
          parameter is coded as a non-negative base10 integer
          representation in clock ticks of a 90-kHz clock.  If the
          parameter is not present, then no initial buffering time
          value is defined.  Otherwise the value of sprop-init-buf-time
          MUST be an integer in the range of 0 to 4294967295, inclusive.</t>
          <t></t>
          <t>In addition to the signaled sprop-init-buf-time, receivers
          SHOULD take into account the transmission delay jitter
          buffering, including buffering for the delay jitter caused by
          mixers, translators, gateways, proxies, traffic-shapers, and
          other network elements.</t>

          present if the value of packetization-mode is equal to 0 or 1.
          sprop-max-don-diff is an integer in the range of 0 to 32767,

  <section title="Mapping to SDP">
   <t>The mapping of the above defined payload format media subtype and its parameters SHALL be done according to Section 3 of RFC 4855 <xref target="RFC4855"/>.</t>

   <t><list style="empty">
     <t>a=fmtp:97 profile-level-id=008016</t>

   <section title="Offer/Answer Considerations">
    <t>When H264-RCDO is offered over RTP using SDP in an Offer/Answer model <xref target="RFC3264"/> for unicast and multicast usage, the limitations and rules described in Section 8.2.2 of RFC3984bis <xref target="I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-rfc3984bis"/> apply. Note that the profile_idc byte of the H264-RCDO profile-level-id parameter can only take the value of 0 (no profile).</t>

    <t>For interoperability with systems not supporting H264-RCDO, it is RECOMMENDED to offer the H264 media subtype as well. As specified in RFC 3264 <xref target="RFC3264"/>, listing the payload number for H264-RCDO before H264 in the format list on the "m=" line signals that H264-RCDO is preferred over H264.

  <section title="IANA Considerations">
   <t>This document requests that IANA registers H264-RCDO as specified in Section <xref target="mtd"/>.  The media subtype is also requested to be added to the IANA registry for "RTP Payload Format MIME types" (http://www.iana.org/assignments/rtp-parameters).</t>
  </section>


  <section title="Security Considerations">
   <!-- Based on general text from draft-ietf-avt-rtp-howto -->
   <t>RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP specification <xref target="RFC3550"/>, and in any applicable RTP profile. The main security considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload format defined within this document are confidentiality, integrity and source authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encryption of the RTP payload.  Integrity of the RTP packets through suitable cryptographic integrity protection mechanism.  Cryptographic system may also allow the authentication of the source of the payload.  A suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload format should provide confidentiality, integrity protection and at least source authentication capable of determining if an RTP packet is from a member of the RTP session or not. </t>
   <t>Note that the appropriate mechanism to provide security to RTP and payloads following this document may vary.  It is dependent on the application, the transport, and the signalling protocol employed. Therefore a single mechanism is not sufficient, although if suitable the usage of SRTP <xref target="RFC3711"/> is recommended.  Other mechanism that may be used are IPsec <xref target="RFC4301"/> and TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/> (RTP over TCP), but also other alternatives may exist. </t>
   <t>Refer also to section 9 of RFC3984bis <xref target="I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-rfc3984bis"/>, as no reasons for separate considerations are introduced in this document.</t>
