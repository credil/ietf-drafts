   Diameter Network Address and Port Translation Control Application
                     draft-ietf-dime-nat-control-02

Abstract

   This document describes the framework, messages, and procedures for
   the Diameter Network Address and Port Translation Control Application
   (DNCA), allowing for per-endpoint control of large scale NAT/NAPT
   devices, which are put in place to cope with IPv4-address space
   completion.  The DNCA allows external devices to configure and manage
   a NAT device - expanding the existing Diameter-based AAA and policy
   control capabilities with a NAT/NAPT control component.  These
   external devices can be network elements in the data plane such as a
   Network Access Server (NAS), or can be more centralized control plane
   devices such as AAA-servers.  DNCA establishes a context to commonly
   identify and manage endpoints on a gateway or server, and a large
   scale NAPT/NAT device.  This includes, for example, the control of
   the total number of NAT-bindings allowed or the allocation of a
   specific NAT-binding for a particular endpoint.  In addition, it
   allows large scale NAT devices to provide information relevant to
   accounting purposes.

Internet-Draft      Diameter NAT Control Application          March 2010


1.  Introduction

   Internet service providers have started to deploy Network Address
   Translators (NATs) and Network Address and Port Translators (NAPTs)
   at the edge of their networks to deal with the depletion of available
   public IPv4 addresses.  This document defines a Diameter application
   for providers deploying such NATs and NAPT devices.  The use of a
   Diameter application allows for simple integration into the existing
   AAA environment of a provider.

   The Diameter NAPT Control Application (DNCA) offers the following
   capabilities:

   1.  Limit/Define the number of NAPT/NAT-bindings made available to an
       individual subscriber or end point.

   2.  Support the allocation of specific NAPT/NAT-bindings.  Two types
       of specific bindings can be distinguished:

       *  Allocation of a pre-defined NAT-binding.  Both the internal as
          well as the external IP-address/port pair are specified within
          the request.  Some deployment cases, such as access to a web-
          server within a user's home network with IP-address and port,
          benefit from statically configured bindings.

       *  Allocation of an external IP-address for a given internal IP-
          address.  The allocated external IP-address will be reported
          back to the requestor.  In some deployment scenarios, the
          application requires immediate knowledge of the allocated
          binding for a given internal IP-address but does not control
          the allocation of the external IP-address (e.g.  SIP-proxy
          server deployments).

   3.  Define the external address-pool(s) to be used for allocating an
       external IP-address.  External address-pools can either be pre-
       assigned at the NAPT/NAT, or specified within a request.  If pre-
       assigned address-pools are used, a request needs to include a
       reference to identify the pool.  Otherwise, the request will
       contain a description of the IP- address pool(s) to be used (e.g.
       list of IP-subnets).

   4.  Accounting/Reporting: Report established bindings for a
       particular user.  The collected information is used by accounting
       systems, for statistical purposes, etc.

   5.  Query functionality to retrieve details about bindings on demand.
       This feature complements the previously mentioned accounting
       functionality mentioned above (see item 4).  The query

Internet-Draft      Diameter NAT Control Application          March 2010


       functionality complements alternative information query
       mechanisms such as SNMP-based mechanisms, if available.

   6.  Common identification of a subscriber or endpoint on multiple
       network devices such as the NAPT/NAT device, the AAA server, or
       the Network Access Server (NAS).  Endpoint identification is
       facilitated through a Global Endpoint ID.  Endpoints are
       identified through a single or a set of classifiers such as IP
       address, VLAN identifier, or interface identifier which uniquely
       identify the traffic associated with a particular global endpoint

   This document is structured as follows: Section 2 lists terminology,
   while Section 3 provides an introduction to the Diameter NAPT Control
   Application and its overall deployment framework.  Sections 4 to 8
   cover the DNCA specifics, with Section 4 describing session
   management, Section 5 the use of the Diameter base protocol, Section
   6 new commands, Section 7 the respective AVPs used, and Section 8
   accounting aspects.  Section 9 presents an AVP occurance table.  IANA
   and security considerations are addressed in Sections 10 and 11.

3.  Deployment Framework

3.1.  Deployment Scenario

   Figure 1 shows a typical network deployment for internet access.  A
   user's IPv4-host gains access to the internet though a Network Access
   Server (NAS) which facilitates the authentication of the endpoint and
   configures the user's connection according to the authorization and
   configuration data received from the AAA-server upon successful
   authentication.  Public IPv4 addresses are used throughout the
   network.

    <-------------------- Public IPv4 ---------------------->

         Figure 1: Typical network deployment for internet access

   Figure 2 depicts the deployment scenario when a service provider
   introduces a NAT device to increase the efficiency of the global IPv4
   address pool utilization.  The objective is to provide the customer
   with connectivity to the public IPv4 Internet.  The NAT device
   performs network address (and optionally protocol) translation,
   depending on whether the access network uses private IPv4 addresses
   or public IPv6 addresses, to public IPv4 addresses.  If the NAT
   device would be put in place without any endpoint awareness, the
   service offerings of the service provider would be hampered.
   Provisioning static NAT-bindings for particular endpoints, using
   different public IP-address pools for different set of endpoints
   (e.g. residential or business customers), as well as reporting on the
   allocated bindings on a per-endpoint basis would be burdensome for a
   service provider if the NAT device would not be aware of endpoints
   and allow for per-endpoint control and management which easily
   integrates with the already existing per-endpoint management
   infrastructure of the service provider.

3.2.  Diameter NAPT Control Application Overview

   The Diameter NAT Control Application runs between a Diameter NAT
   Control Application Agent on the NAT and the Diameter NAT Control
   Application Manager.  DNCA allows for per-endpoint control and
   management of a NAT.  Being based on Diameter, DNCA integrates well
   with the suite of Diameter applications deployed for per-endpoint
   authentication, authorization, accounting, and policy control in
   service provider networks.

   DNCA offers request and answer commands to control the allowed number
   of NAT-bindings per endpoint, to request the allocation of specific
   bindings for an endpoint, to define the address pool to be used for
   an endpoint, to provide per endpoint reporting on the allocated NAT-
   bindings, as well as to provide for unique identification of an
   endpoint on both NAT, AAA-server and NAS, thus simplifying the
   correlation of accounting data streams.

   DNCA allows for controlling the behavior of a NAT device on a per-
   endpoint basis during initial session establishment as well as at
   later stages by providing an update procedure for already established
   sessions.  Using DNCA, per-endpoint NAT-binding information can be
   retrieved either using accounting mechanisms or through an explicit
   session query to the NAT.

3.3.  Deployment Scenarios For The Diameter NAPT Control Application

   Deployment dependent, the role of the Diameter NAT Control Manager
   can be fulfilled by either the NAS or by an external server such as



Brockners, et al.       Expires September 8, 2010               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      Diameter NAT Control Application          March 2010


   an AAA-server.  The two deployment scenarios are outlined in Figure 3
   ("integrated deployment") and Figure 4 ("autonomous deployment").

   Within the figures (M) denotes the network element which takes on the
   DNCA manager role.  Similarly, (A) identifies the network element
   which performs the DNCA agent role.

   The integrated deployment approach hides the existence of the NAT
   device from external servers such as the AAA-server as much as
   possible.  It is suited for environments where minimal changes to the
   existing AAA deployment are desired.  The NAS, taking the role of the
   DNCA manager, is in charge of initiating and managing the session to
   the NAT device, exchanging NAT specific configuration information as
   well as handling reporting and accounting information.  The NAS
   receives reporting and accounting information from NAT device.  This
   way the NAS can provide for a single accounting record for the user,
   offloading external accounting systems from correlating accounting
   information received from multiple sources.

   An example network attachment for an integrated NAT deployment could
   be described as follows: An endpoint connects to the network, with
   the NAS being the point of attachment.  After successful
   authentication, NAS receives endpoint related authorization data from
   the AAA-server.  A portion of the authorization data applies to per-
   endpoint configuration on the NAS itself, another portion describes
   authorization and configuration information for NAT control aimed at
   the NAT.  NAS will initiate a DNCA session to the NAT and send the
   relevant authorization and configuration information for the
   particular endpoint to the NAT device.  This could comprise e.g.
   NAT-bindings which have to be pre-established for the endpoint, or
   management related configuration, such as the maximum number of NAT-
   bindings allowed for the endpoint or accounting requirements.  The
   NAT device will send its per-endpoint accounting information to the
   NAS which aggregates the accounting information received form the NAT
   with its local accounting information for the endpoint into a single
   accounting stream towards the AAA-server.

   The autonomous deployment approach decouples user management on NAS
   and NAT device.  The AAA system performing the role of the DNCA
   manager manages the connection to the NAT device, controls the per-
   endpoint configuration, and also receives accounting and reporting
   information from the NAT device.  Different from the integrated
   deployment scenario, the autonomous deployment scenario does not
   "hide" the existence of the NAT device from the AAA infrastructure.
   Here two accounting streams are received by the AAA-server for one
   particular endpoint, one from the NAS, and one from the NAT device.

4.  Diameter NAT Control Application Session Establishment and
    Management

   Note that this section forward references some of the commands and
   AVPs defined for the DNCA.  Please refer to Section 6 and Section 7
   for details.

4.1.  Parties Involved

   Authorization and control models supported by this application
   include the following parties:

   o  Diameter NAT Control Application (DNCA) agent: The DNCA agent is
      part of the Large scale NAT (NAT) device

   o  Diameter NAT Control Application (DNCA) manager

   The NAT control requesting entity is always the DNCA manager.
   Sessions will always be initiated, updated, or terminated by the DNCA
   manager.  This mode of operation is sometimes also referred to as
   "push mode".

   DNCA manager can be NAS or AAA Server.  DNCA manager will initiate a
   session with DNCA agent when it learns about the subscriber.  DNCA
   manager may learn about a subscriber when it receives authentication,
   authorization or accounting request for that subscriber or by some
   other means such as on the box configuration to identify subscriber
   w.r.t IP packets.

4.2.  Session Establishment

   The DNCA manager establishes a session to the DNCA agent to control
   the behavior of the NAT device.  During session establishment, the
   DNCA manager will pass along configuration information to the DNCA
   agent.  Session configuration information could for example comprise
   the maximum number of bindings allowed for the endpoint associated
   with this session, a set of pre-defined NAT-bindings to be
   established for this endpoint, or a description of the address pool,
   external addresses should be allocated from.

   The DNCA manager initiates the Diameter NAT Control session to the
   DNCA agent.  The DNCA manager generates a NAT-Control Request (NCR)
   message to the DNCA agent with NC-Request-Type AVP set to
   INITIAL_REQUEST.  On receipt of the NCR the DNCA agent will setup a
   new session for the endpoint associated with the endpoint
   classifier(s) contained in the NCR.  The DNCA agent notifies the DNCA
   manager about successful session setup using a NAT-Control Answer
   (NCA) message with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.  Figure 5

   shows the protocol interaction between the DNCA manager and the DNCA
   agent.

   The initial NAT-Control-Request can contain configuration information
   for the session which specifies the behavior of the NAT for the
   session.  Configuration information which can be included comprises:

   o  A list of NAT-bindings which should be pre-allocated for the
      session (e.g. in case a subscriber requires a fixed external IP-
      address/port pair for one of his applications).

   o  The maximum number of NAT bindings allowed for an endpoint.

   o  A description of the external address pool(s) to be used for the
      session.

   o  A reference to a predefined binding rule on DNCA agent that will
      be applied to the session.  Such a predefined binding rule on DNCA
      agent may contain, for example, the name of the IP-address pool
      that external IP-addresses should be allocated from, maximum
      number of bindings permitted for the endpoint etc.

   In certain cases, the DNCA agent may not be able to perform the tasks
   requested within the NCR.  These include the following:

   o  If a DNCA agent receives a NCR from a DNCA manager with NC-
      Request-Type AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST that identifies an already
      existing session (i.e.  DNCA manager and endpoint identifier match
      an already existing session), the DNCA agent will return NCA with
      Result-Code set to SESSION_EXISTS, and provides Session-Id of the
      existing session in Duplicate-Session-Id AVP.

   o  If a DNCA agent receives an NCR from a DNCA manager with NC-
      Request-Type AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST that matches more than one
      of the already existing sessions (i.e.  DNCA manager and endpoint
      identifier match already existing sessions), the DNCA agent will
      return a NCA with Result-Code set to Insufficient-Classifiers.  In
      case a DNCA manager receives a NCA that reports Insufficient-
      Classifiers, it may choose to retry establishing a new session
      using additional/more specific classifiers.

   o  If the NCR contains a binding rule not defined on the NAT, the
      DNCA agent will return a NCA with Result-Code AVP set to
      UNKNOWN_BINDING_RULE.

   o  In case the DNCA agent is unable to establish all of the bindings
      requested in the NCR, it will return a NCA with Result-Code set to
      BINDING_FAILURE.  The DNCA agent (i.e.  NAT) treats a NCR as an

      atomic operation; hence none of the requested bindings will be
      established by NAT.  Either all requested actions within a NCR are
      completed successfully, or the entire request fails.

   o  If DNCA agent does not have sufficient resources to process a
      request, it will return NCA with Result-Code set to
      RESOURCE_FAILURE.

   o  In case Max-NAT-Binding and Nat-Control-Definition are included in
      the NCR along with a reference to a binding rule (i.e. a
      predefined template on NAT) and the values in Max-NAT-Binding and
      NAT-Control-Definition contradict those specified in the pre-
      defined binding rule, Max-NAT-Binding and NAT-Control-Definition
      override the values specified in the binding rule.

      Figure 5: Initial NAT Control request and session establishment

4.3.  Session Re-Authorization

   Session re-authorization is performed if the DNCA manager desires to
   change the behavior of the NAT for an existing session.  Re-
   authorization could be used, for example, to change the number of
   allowed bindings for a particular session, or establish or remove a
   pre-defined binding.

   The DNCA manager generates a NAT-Control Request (NCR) message to the
   DNCA agent with NC-Request-Type AVP set to UPDATE_REQUEST upon



Brockners, et al.       Expires September 8, 2010              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft      Diameter NAT Control Application          March 2010


   receiving a trigger signal.  In case the session is updated
   successfully, the DNCA agent notifies the DNCA manager about
   successful session update using a NAT-Control Answer (NCA) message
   with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.  Figure 6 shows the
   protocol interaction between the DNCA manager and the DNCA agent.

   In certain cases, the DNCA agent may not be able to perform the tasks
   requested within the NCR.  These include the following:

   o  If DNCA agent receives a NCR update/query request for non-existent
      session it will set error code in answer, to
      DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.

   o  If the NCR contains a binding rule not defined on the NAT, the
      DNCA agent will return a NCA with Result-Code AVP set to
      UNKNOWN_BINDING_RULE.

   o  If the DNCA agent cannot establish the requested binding because
      the maximum number of allowed bindings has been reached for the
      Endpoint Classifier, it will return NCA with Result-Code AVP set
      to MAXIMUM_BINDINGS_REACHED_FOR_ENDPOINT.

   o  In case the DNCA agent cannot establish some or all of the
      bindings requested in a NCR, but has not yet reached the maximum
      number of allowed bindings for the subscriber, it will return a
      NCA with Result-Code set to BINDING_FAILURE.  The DNCA agent (i.e.
      NAT) treats a NCR as an atomic operation; hence none of the
      requested bindings will be established by NAT.  Either all
      requested actions within a NCR are completed successfully, or the
      entire request fails.

   o  If DNCA agent does not have sufficient resources to process a
      request, it will return a NCA with Result-Code set to
      RESOURCE_FAILURE.

   o  If a NCR redefines the maximum number of NAT bindings allowed for
      the endpoint, the new value will override any previously defined
      limit on NAT-bindings.  It depends on the implementation of the
      NAT how NAT would cope with a case where the new value is lower
      than the actual number of allocated bindings.  Typically the NAT
      would refrain from enforcing the new limit immediately (i.e.
      actively remove bindings) but rather disallow the establishment of
      new bindings until the current number of bindings is lower than
      the newly established maximum number of allowed bindings.

   o  If a NCR specifies a new binding rule, predefined on the DNCA
      agent, the binding rule will override any previously defined rules
      for the session.

   o  In case Max-NAT-Binding and Nat-Control-Definition AVPs are
      included in the NCR along with a reference to a binding rule (i.e.
      a predefined template on NAT) and the values in Max-NAT-Binding
      and Nat-Control-Definition AVPs contradict those specified in the
      pre-defined binding rule, Max-NAT-Binding and NAT-Control-
      Definition AVPs override the values specified in the binding rule.

             Figure 6: NAT Control request for session update

4.4.  Session And Binding Query

   Session query can be used by the DNCA manager to either retrieve
   information on the current bindings for a particular session at the
   NAT or discover the session identifier for a particular external IP-
   address/port pair.

   The DNCA manager initiates a session query by sending a NAT-Control
   Request (NCR) message to the DNCA agent with NC-Request-Type AVP set
   to QUERY_REQUEST.  Figure 7 shows the protocol interaction between
   the DNCA manager and the DNCA agent.

   Two types of query requests exist.  The first type of query request
   uses the session ID as input parameter to the query.  It is to allow
   the DNCA manager retrieve the current set of bindings for a specific
   session.  The second type of query request is used in to retrieve the
   session identifiers, along with the associated bindings, matching a



Brockners, et al.       Expires September 8, 2010              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft      Diameter NAT Control Application          March 2010


   criteria.  This enables the DNCA manager to find out which sessions
   utilize a specific external IP address.

   1.  Request a list of currently allocated NAT-bindings for a
       particular session: The DNCA agent will, on receipt of the NCR,
       lookup the session information for the session id contained in
       the NCR, and will report all currently active NAT-bindings for
       the session using a NAT-Control Answer (NCA) message with Result-
       Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.  In this case the NCR MUST NOT
       contain a NAT-Control-Definition AVP.  Each NAT-Binding will be
       reported in a NAT-Control-Definition AVP.  In case the session id
       is unknown to the DNCA agent a DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID error
       is returned.

   2.  Retrieve session ids and internal IP-address/port pairs for one
       or multiple external IP-address/port pairs: If the DNCA manager
       wishes to retrieve the session id(s) for one or multiple external
       IP-address/port pairs, it MUST include the external IP-address/
       port pair(s) as part of the NAT-Control-Definition AVP of the
       NCR.  The session id used within the NCR is not meaningful for
       this type of a query.  The DNCA agent will report the NAT-
       bindings and associated session ids corresponding to the external
       IP-address/port pairs in a NAT-Control Answer (NCA) message with
       Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS and the same session id as
       the one used in the NCR.  In case an external IP-address/port
       pair has no associated existing NAT-binding, the NAT-Control-
       Definition AVP contained in the reply just contains the NAT-
       External-Address AVP.

4.5.  Session Termination

   The DNCA manager generates a NAT-Control Request (NCR) message to the
   DNCA agent with NC-Request-Type AVP set to TERMINATE_REQUEST upon
   receiving a trigger signal.  The DNCA agent sends accounting stop
   record reporting all the bindings and notifies the DNCA manager about
   successful session termination using a NAT-Control Answer (NCA)
   message with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.  Figure 8 shows the
   protocol interaction between the DNCA manager and the DNCA agent.

   If a DNCA agent receives a NCR from a DNCA manager with NC-Request-
   Type AVP set to TERMINATE_REQUEST and fails to find a matching
   session, the DNCA agent returns DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID error.

4.6.  DNCA Manager/Agent Failures

   This document does not cover details in case DNCA manager and DNCA
   agent go out of sync, which could happen for example due to DNCA
   manager or DNCA agent restart, (temporary) loss of network
   connectivity etc.  DNCA application will rely on DNCA Manager and
   DNCA Agent to have builtin redundancy support to recover state in
   case of failure.

   Example failure cases include the following:

   o  The DNCA manager loses session state (e.g. due to a restart).  In
      this case,

      *  the DNCA agent may receive a NCR with NC-Request-Type AVP set
         to INITIAL_REQUEST that matches an existing session of DNCA
         agent.  The DNCA agent will return an error that contains
         Duplicate-Session-Id AVP to report Session-Id of existing

         session.  The DNCA manager may then send an explicit
         TERMINATE_REQUEST for the older session that was lost.

      *  the DNCA manager may receive accounting records for a session
         that does not exist.  The DNCA manager will send an accounting
         answer with error-code set to DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.  On
         receipt of which the DNCA agent clears the session and removes
         the associated session state.

   o  The DNCA agent loses session state.  In such a case, the DNCA
      agent could receive a NCR with NC-Request-Type AVP set to
      UPDATE_REQUEST for a non-existent session.  The DNCA agent will
      return NCA with error code set to DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.
      State recovery procedures of the DNCA agent will be covered in a
      future version of this document.

   o  The DNCA manager is unreachable (as e.g. detected by Diameter
      watchdog) or down and accounting requests from the DNCA agent fail
      to get a response.  The mechanism to ensure that a DNCA manager no
      longer has associated state for a session being cleared at the
      DNCA agent is beyond the scope of this document.

   o  The DNCA agent is unreachable or down and NCR requests fail to get
      a response.  Handling of this case depends on the actual service
      offering of the service provider.  The service provider could, for
      example, choose to terminate the access session to the endpoint.


5.  Use Of The Diameter Base Protocol

   The Diameter Base Protocol defined by [RFC3588] shall apply, with the
   clarifications listed in the present specification.

5.1.  Securing Diameter Messages

   For secure transport of Diameter messages, IPSec MAY be used.

   The DNCA agent MAY verify the identity of the DNCA Manager during the
   Capabilities Exchange Request procedure.

   The DNCA agent MAY verify if the DNCA Manager that issues a NCR
   command is allowed to do so, based on:

   o  The Identity of the DNCA Manager

   o  The Type of NCR Command

Internet-Draft      Diameter NAT Control Application          March 2010


   o  The content of the NCR Command

   o  Any combination of the above

5.2.  Accounting Functionality

   Accounting functionality (Accounting Session State Machine, related
   command codes and AVPs) is defined in Section 8 below.

5.3.  Use Of Sessions

   Each DNCA session MUST have a globally unique Session-Id as defined
   in [RFC3588], which MUST NOT be changed during the lifetime of a DNCA
   session.  The Diameter Session-Id serves as the global endpoint
   identifier.  The DNCA agent and DNCA manager maintain state
   associated with the Session-Id.  This globally unique Session-Id is
   used for updating, accounting for and terminating the session.  DNCA
   session MUST NOT have more than one outstanding request at any given
   instant.  The DNCA agent sends an Abort-Session-Request as defined in
   [RFC3588] if it is unable to maintain sessions due to resource
   limitation.

5.4.  Routing Considerations

   It is assumed that the DNCA manager knows the DiameterIdentity of the
   DNCA agent for a given endpoint.  Both the Destination-Realm and
   Destination-Host AVPs are present in the Request from the DNCA
   manager to the DNCA agent.

5.5.  Advertising Application Support

   Diameter applications conforming to this specification MUST advertise
   support by including the value of TBD in:

   o  Auth-Application-Id and Acct-Application-Id of Capabilities-
      Exchange-Request (CER)

   o  Auth-Application-Id of NC-request (NCR), NC-Answer (NCA), Abort-
      Session-Request(ASR), Abort-Session-Answer (AAA) messages

   o  Acct-Application-Id in Accounting-Request (ACR) and Accounting-
      Answer (AAA) messages.


6.  Diameter NAT Control Application Commands

   The following commands are used to establish, maintain and clear NAT
   bindings.

   The Auth-Application-Id AVP (AVP Code 258) is assigned by IANA to
   Diameter applications.  The value of the Auth-Application-Id for the
   Diameter NAT Control Application is TBD.

7.2.  Additional Result-Code AVP Values

   This section defines new values for the Result-Code AVP which SHALL
   be supported by all Diameter implementations that conform to the
   present document.

7.2.2.  Transient Failures

   Result-Code AVP values that fall within the transient failures
   category are those used to inform a peer that the request could not
   be satisfied at the time that it was received.  The request may be
   able to be satisfied in the future.

   The following new values of the Result-Code AVP are defined:

      RESOURCE_FAILURE (TBD)

         The DNCA agent indicates that the binding could not be
         installed or a new session could not be created due to resource
         shortage.

7.2.3.  Permanent Failures

   Result-Code AVP values that fall within the permanent failures
   category are used to inform the peer that the request failed, and
   should not be attempted again.  The request may be able to be
   satisfied in the future.

   The following new values of the Result-Code AVP are defined:

      UNKNOWN_BINDING_RULE_NAME (TBD)

         The DNCA agent indicates that the binding could not be
         installed or a new session could not be created due to resource
         shortage.

      BINDING_FAILURE (TBD)

         The DNCA indicates that the requested binding(s) could not be
         installed.

      MAXIMUM_BINDINGS_REACHED_FOR_ENDPOINT (TBD)

         The DNCA agent denies the request because the maximum number of
         allowed bindings has been reached for the specified Endpoint
         Classifier.

      SESSION_EXISTS (TBD)

         The DNCA agent denies request to initialize a new session, if
         it already has a DNCA session that uses the same set of
         classifiers as indicated by DNCA manager in the new session
         init request.

      INSUFFICIENT_CLASSIFIERS (TBD)

         The DNCA agent defines request to initialize a new session, if
         the classifiers in the request match more than one of the
         existing sessions on DNCA agent.

7.7.1.  NC-Request-Type AVP

   The NC-Request-Type AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated and
   contains the reason for sending the NAT-Control-Request command.  It
   shall be present in all NAT-Control-Request messages.

   The following values are defined:

      INITIAL_REQUEST (1)





Brockners, et al.       Expires September 8, 2010              [Page 27]

Internet-Draft      Diameter NAT Control Application          March 2010


         An Initial Request is used to install binding at the DNCA agent
         on a successful access session setup.

      UPDATE_REQUEST (2)

         An Update Request is used to update bindings previously
         installed on a given access session, to add new binding on a
         given access session, or to remove one or several binding(s)
         activated on a given access session.

      TERMINATION_REQUEST (3)

         Termination Request is used to deactivate and remove all
         bindings previously activated on a given access session.

      QUERY_REQUEST (4)

         Query Request is used to query the DNCA agent about the
         currently installed bindings for an endpoint classifier.

7.7.2.  NAT-Control-Install AVP

   The NAT-Control AVP (AVP code TBD) is of type Grouped, and it is used
   to activate or install NAT bindings.  It also contains Max-NAT-
   Bindings that defines maximum number of NAT bindings to be allowed
   for a subscriber and NAT-Control-Binding-Rule that references
   predefined policy template on DNCA agent that may contain static
   bindings, maximum number of bindings to be allowed, address pool from
   which external binding address should be allocated.

   AVP format:
     NAT-Control-Install ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                              * [ NAT-Control-Definition ]
                                [ NAT-Control-Binding-Rule ]

7.7.4.  NAT-Control-Definition AVP

   The NAT-Control-Definition AVP (AVP code TBD) is of type Grouped, and
   it describes a binding.

   The NAT-Control-Definition AVP uniquely identifies the binding
   between the DNCA agent and the DNCA manager.

   If both the NAT-Internal-Address and NAT-External-Address AVP(s) are
   supplied, it is a pre-defined binding.

   The Protocol AVP describes the transport protocol for which the
   binding is created.  Exactly zero or one Protocol AVP may be
   contained within NAT-Control-Definition AVP.  If the Protocol AVP is
   omitted and if both internal and external address are specified then
   the binding reserves the addresses for all transport protocols.

   The Direction AVP is of type Enumerated and specifies in which
   direction to apply the binding.  The values of the enumeration
   applicable in this context are: "IN","OUT".  If Direction AVP is OUT
   or absent NAT-Internal-Address refers to the address of the
   subscriber device that needs to be translated.  If Direction AVP is
   "IN" NAT-Internal-Address is the destination address that has to be
   translated.

   AVP format:
     NAT-Control-Definition ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                                 { NAT-Internal-Address }
                                 [ Protocol ]
                                 [ Direction ]
                                 [ NAT-External-Address ]
                                 [ Session-Id ]
                               * [ AVP ]

7.7.5.  NAT-Internal-Address AVP

   The NAT-Internal-Address AVP (AVP code TBD) is of type Grouped, and
   it describes the internal IP address and port for a binding.  Framed-
   IPV6-Prefix and Framed-IP-Address AVPs are mutually exclusive.

   AVP format:
     NAT-Internal-Address ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                               [ Framed-IP-Address ]
                               [ Framed-IPv6-Prefix ]
                               [ Port]
                             * [ AVP ]

7.7.6.  NAT-External-Address AVP

   The NAT-External-Address AVP (AVP code TBD) is of type Grouped, and
   it describes the external IP address and port for a binding.  IP-
   Address-Mask AVP can only be specified when Framed-IP-Address AVP is
   present.

   AVP format:
     NAT-External-Address ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                               [ Framed-IP-Address ]
                               [ IP-Address-Mask ]
                               [ Port ]
                             * [ AVP ]

7.7.7.  Max-NAT-Bindings

   The Max-NAT-Bindings AVP (AVP code TBD) is of type Unsigned32, and it
   indicates the maximum number of NAT bindings allowed.

7.7.8.  NAT-Control-Binding-Rule AVP

   The NAT-Control-Binding-Rule AVP (AVP code TBD) is of type is of type
   OctetString, and it defines a name for a policy template that will be
   predefined at NAT.  Details on the contents and structure of the
   template as well as how it would be configured are outside the scope
   of this document.  The policy to which this AVP refers to may contain
   NAT Bindings, address pool for external address allocation of NAT
   binding, maximum allowed NAT bindings etc.

7.7.9.  Duplicate-Session-Id AVP

   The Duplicate-Session-Id AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of is of type
   UTF8String.  It is used to report error and contains the Session-Id
   of an existing session.


8.  Accounting Commands

   The Diameter NAT Control Application reuses session based accounting
   as defined in Diameter Base Protocol [RFC3588] to report the bindings
   used per endpoint.  This reporting is achieved by sending Diameter
   Accounting Requests (ACR) [Start, Interim and Stop] from the DNCA
   agent to DNCA manager.

   The DNCA agent sends an ACR Start on receiving an NCR with NC-
   Request-Type AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST received for a session, or on
   creation of the first binding for a session requested in an earlier
   NCR.  The DNCA may send ACR Interim updates, if required, either due



Brockners, et al.       Expires September 8, 2010              [Page 30]

Internet-Draft      Diameter NAT Control Application          March 2010


   to a change in bindings resulting from an NCR with NC-Request-Type
   AVP set to UPDATE_REQUEST, or periodically as specified in Acct-
   Interim-Interval by DNCA Manager or when it creates/tears down
   bindings.  An ACR Stop is sent by the DNCA agent on receiving an NCR
   with NC-Request-Type AVP set to TERMINATION_REQUEST.

   The function of correlating the multiple bindings used by an endpoint
   at any given time is relegated to the post processor.

   The DNCA agent may trigger an interim accounting record when maximum
   number of bindings, if received in NCR, is reached.

8.1.  NAT Control Accounting Messages

   The ACR and ACA messages are reused as defined in Diameter Base
   Protocol [RFC3588] for exchanging endpoint NAT binding details
   between the DNCA agent and the CDF.  DNCA Application ID is used in
   the accounting commands.  ACR will contain one or more optional NAT-
   Control-Record AVP to report the bindings.  The DNCA agent indicates
   the number of the currently allocated NAT bindings to the DNCA
   manager using the Current-NAT-Bindings AVP.  This number needs to
   match the number of bindings identified as active within the NAT-
   Control-Record AVP.

8.2.  NAT Control Accounting AVPs

   In addition to AVPs for ACR specified in [RFC3588], the DNCA agent
   must add the NAT-Control-Record AVP.

8.2.1.  NAT-Control-Record

   The NAT-Control-Record AVP (AVP code TBD) is of type Grouped, and it
   describes a binding and its status.  Event-Timestamp indicates the
   time at which binding was created if NAT-Control-Binding-Status is
   set to Created, or time at which the binding was removed if NAT-
   Control-Binding-Status is set to removed.  If the NAT-Control-
   Binding-Status is active Event-Timestamp need not be present, if
   present it indicates that binding is active at the mentioned time.
     NAT-Control-Record ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                            { NAT-Control-Definition }
                            { NAT-Control-Binding-Status }
                            [ Event-Timestamp ]

8.2.2.  NAT-Control-Binding-Status

   The NAT-Control-Binding-Status AVP (AVP code TBD) is of type
   enumerated and it describes whether the binding being reported was
   created or removed or simply indicates that it is active.

Internet-Draft      Diameter NAT Control Application          March 2010


   The following values are defined:

      Created (1)

         Indicates that NAT binding is created.

      Active (2)

         Indicates that NAT binding is active.

      Removed (3)

         Indicates that the NAT binding was removed.

8.2.3.  Current-NAT-Bindings

   The Current-NAT-Bindings AVP (AVP code TBD) is of type Unsigned32,
   and it indicates number of NAT bindings active on NAT.


9.  AVP Occurrence Table

   The following sections presents the AVPs defined in this document and
   specifies in which Diameter messages they MAY be present.  Note that
   AVPs that can only be present within a Grouped AVP are not
   represented in this table.

   The table uses the following symbols:



      0         The AVP MUST NOT be present in the message.

      0+        Zero or more instances of the AVP MAY be present in the
                message.

      0-1       Zero or one instance of the AVP MAY be present in the
                message.  It is considered an error if there is more
                than one instance of the AVP.

      1         One instance of the AVP MUST be present in the message.

      1+        At least one instance of the AVP MUST be present in the
                message.

11.  Security Considerations

   Similar to what the Diameter QoS application (see
   [I-D.ietf-dime-diameter-qos]) does for authorization of QoS
   reservations, this document describes procedures for authorizing
   network address translation related attributes and parameters by an



Brockners, et al.       Expires September 8, 2010              [Page 36]

   entity which is non-local to the device performing network address
   translation.  The security considerations for the Diameter QoS
   application (see [I-D.ietf-dime-diameter-qos] section 11) apply in a
   similar way to the DNCA.  Securing the information exchange between
   the authorizing entity (the DNCA manager) as well as the NAT device
   requires bilateral authentication of the involved parties,
   authorization of the involved parties to perform the required
   procedures and functions, as well as procedures to ensure integrity
   and confidentiality of the information exchange.  DNCA makes use of
   the capabilities offered by Diameter as well as the underlying
   transport protocols to deliver on these requirements (see Section 5.1
   ).

   It is assumed that the DNCA agent and DNCA manager are in the same
   domain and have a mutual trust set up.  Authorization between the
   DNCA agent and DNCA manager is beyond the scope of this document.
