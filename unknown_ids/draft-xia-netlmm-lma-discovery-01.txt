Internet-Draft                LMA Discovery                   April 2009


Abstract

   This draft defines a DHCP-based scheme to enable dynamic discovery of
   a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in Proxy Mobile IPv6.  Existing Dynamic
   Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options are used allowing a Mobile
   Access Gateway (MAG) to request the LMA's IP address, Fully Qualified
   Domain Name (FQDN), or home network prefix via the DHCP response.

Internet-Draft                LMA Discovery                   April 2009


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.giaretta-netlmm-mip-interactions] describes possible scenarios
   which require an interaction between PMIPv6 and MIPv6.  In a similar
   scenario depicted in Figure 1 , some mobile nodes use Mobile IPv6 to
   manage their movements while others rely on a network-based mobility
   solution provided by the network.  There is a common mobility anchor
   that acts as Mobile IPv6 Home Agent and Proxy Mobile IPv6 LMA,
   depending on the type of the node.

             Figure 1: Hybrid deployment with MIPv6 and PMIPv6

   Before a MAG or a MN can engage in mobility management signaling with
   the mobility anchor (LMA or HA), it SHOULD either know the IP address
   of the mobility anchor via pre-configuration, or dynamically discover
   it.

   [I-D.ietf-mip6-hiopt] defines DHCPv6 options which are used for
   acquiring the mobile anchor(HA) information from a DHCPv6 server in
   MIPv6, while this document describes a procedure that the MAG
   retrieves the information from the same server using the DHCP options
   in Proxy MIPv6.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

     |              |------------>|          | Information Request
     |              |             |          |
     |              |       3     |          |
     |              |<------------|          | Information Reply
     |              |             |          |


                     Figure 2: Dynamic LMA Using DHCP

   1.  The mobile node executes the network access authentication
       procedure (e.g., IEEE802.1X or IKEv2 SA establishment followed by
       EAP authentication) and it interacts with the NAS/MAG.  The NAS/
       MAG interacts with the AAA server to authenticate the mobile
       node.  In the process of authorizing the mobile node, the AAA
       server verifies in the AAA profile that the mobile node is
       allowed to use the Proxy Mobile IPv6 service.  The AAA server
       possibly assigns a LMA and returns this information to the NAS
       through Diameter [I-D.korhonen-dime-pmip6] or RADIUS
       [I-D.xia-netlmm-radius], thus, it is not necessary to continue
       with step 2 and 3.  Otherwise, the NAS/MAG continues the
       following DHCP exchanges to inquire the home network information.
   2.  The NAS/MAG as a DHCP client sends a DHCPv6 Information Request
       message [RFC3315] to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers
       multicast address.  In this message, the NAS/MAG SHALL include
       Home Network Identifier Option [I-D.ietf-mip6-hiopt] in the
       OPTION_ORO, and a Home Network Identifier Option with id-type set

       to 0.  When the Sub-opt-code of the sub-option is set to 1 in the
       request, the Home Network Parameter field MUST contain an
       identifier to specify the home network requested by the mobile
       node.  This field MUST be set in the form of a FQDN [RFC1035],
       encoded as specified in Section 8 of [RFC3315].  If the mobile
       node has a NAI, the FQDN can be constructed by concatenating a
       fixed string with the realm part of the NAI.  This sub-option in
       the request SHOULD be copied into the Home Network Information
       option returned in the reply.  The NAS/MAG SHALL also include the
       OPTION_CLIENTID to identify itself to the DHCP server.  The DHCP
       Unique Identifier(DUID) can be generated based on the mobile
       node's link layer address or other information.  How to create
       DUID is beyond the scope of this document.
   3.  The DHCP server identifies the client by looking at the DUID for
       the client in the OPTION_CLIENTID.  The DHCP server also
       determines that the MAG is requesting home network information by
       looking at the Home Network Identifier Option (id-type 0).  The
       DHCP server retrieves the allocated LMA, FQDN, and home network
       prefix, and includes them in the Home Network Information Option
       [I-D.ietf-mip6-hiopt] in the Information Reply Message that it
       sends to the DHCP client.


4.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent

   A DHPCv6 relay agent function [RFC3315] SHOULD be used when NAS/MAG
   and the DHCP server are not connected directly.  In this
   configuration, the relay agent function is co-located in the NAS/MAG
   with the DHCPv6 client function.  Rather than using multicast to send
   DHCPv6 messages to the DHCPv6 server, the DHCPv6 client in the NAS/
   MAG hands any outbound DHCPv6 messages to the co- located relay
   agent.  Responses from the DHCPv6 server are delivered to the relay
   agent function in the NAS/MAG, which extracts the encapsulated
   message and delivers it to the DHCPv6 client in the NAS/MAG.

4.1.  Relay agent configuration

   The use of the relay agent function in the NAS/MAG allows the NAS/MAG
   to unicast DHCPv6 messages to the DHCPv6 server.  The relay agent
   must be configured with the address of the DHCPv6 server or another
   DHCPv6 relay agent that will forward message on to a DHCPv6 server.

4.2.  Transmission of DHCPv6 messages

   In this configuration, when the DHCPv6 client in the NAS/MAG sends a
   message, it hands the message to the DHCPv6 relay agent in the NAS/
   MAG.  The relay agent encapsulates the message from the client in a
   Relay-forward message and sends the resulting DHCPv6 message to the

Internet-Draft                LMA Discovery                   April 2009


   DHCP server.  The relay agent sets the fields in the Relay-forward
   message as follows:


   msg-type       RELAY-FORW
   hop-count      1
   link-address   A non-link-local address from the upstream or loopback
                  interface.
   peer-address   A non-link-local address from the upstream or loopback
                  interface.
   options        MUST include a "Relay Message option" in which OPTION_ORO
                  is included.


4.3.  Receipt of DHCPv6 messages

   In this configuration, messages from the DHCPv6 server will be
   returned to the DHCPv6 relay agent, with the message for the DHCPv6
   client encapsulated in the Relay Message option [RFC3315] in a Relay-
   reply message.  The relay agent function extracts the message for the
   client from the Relay Message option and hands the message to the
   DHCPv6 client in the NAS/MAG.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the use of DHCPv6 for LMA discovery in Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 networks.  It does not introduce any additional security
   concerns beyond those described in the "Security Considerations"
   section of the DHCPv6 base specification [RFC3315].


6.  IANA considerations

   None.


7.  Acknowledgements

   TBD.
