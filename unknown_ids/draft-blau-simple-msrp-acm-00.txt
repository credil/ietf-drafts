Abstract

   This document defines an alternative connection model for MSRP UAs.
   The model differs from the standard MSRP model, as defined in RFC4975
   and RFC4976, in that it uses SDP in a more conventional way when it
   comes to conveying endpoint address information, and also uses
   mainstream mechanisms for NAT traversal instead of using MSRP relays.

Internet-Draft                    MRSP                         June 2008


1.  Introduction

   MSRP [RFC4975] is designed to use MSRP relays [RFC4976] as a means
   for NAT traversal and policy enforcement.  However, in many SIP
   networks it is often desired to deploy MSRP without the use of MSRP
   relays, and instead use more general NAT traversal mechanisms - such
   as COMEDIA [RFC4145] and ICE [I.D-ietf-mmusic-ice] - while also using
   SIP ALG controlled media relays for more application specific policy
   control.

   An example is the OMA defined "Instant Message using SIMPLE" [OMA-TS-
   SIMPLE_IM-V1_0-20080312-D], where the UA of one endpoint of every
   MSRP transport connection is a media server located in the network.
   The media server has a global address and is handling application
   specific policy control as well as NAT traversal, the latter through
   use of COMEDIA which all IM MSRP clients are mandated to support.

   Many networks where MSRP usage is emerging also contain ALGs that are
   deployed for reasons of performance monitoring, lawful intercept,
   address domain bridging, interconnect SLA policy enforcement, etc.  A
   typical example here is the 3GPP defined Interconnect Border Control
   Function (IBCF) [3GPP TS23.228], which controls a media relay that
   handles all types of SIP session media (voice, video, MSRP, etc).
   Due to the fact that the MSRP connection model is not in a
   conventional way using the address information in the SDP c- and
   m-line for negotiating transport connection endpoints, and also
   checks consistence between addresses in the MSRP protocol and in the
   SDP a=path line, this forces the IBCF/media relay to act as an SDP
   aware MSRP B2BUA, whereas for basically all other UDP and TCP
   transported based media sessions it can acts as an SDP aware Relay-
   NAPT - which is much simpler than having to act as an MSRP B2BUA.

   To adapt MSRP to a more conventional SDP usage, this document defines
   an alternative connection model for MSRP, mandating and detailing use
   of COMEDIA [RFC4145] and optional use of ICE [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-
   tcp], and use of SDP c- and m-line address information for transport
   connection set up - instead of address information in the MSRP URI in
   the a=path line.

   The alternative connection model defined in this document also
   includes mechanisms that makes UAs conformant to this document to be
   able to use [RFC4975] compliant behavior when so needed for
   interacting with [RFC4975] conformant UAs.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability statement

   The alternative connection model for MSRP, as defined in this
   document, SHOULD be used when a UA does not use an MSRP relay to
   proxy its MSRP communication.

   UAs conformant to this document are fully interoperable with
   [RFC4975] conformant UAs, since when interacting with such UAs they
   will more or less fall back to [RFC4975] compliant behavior.
   However, if a UA conformant to this document is behind NAT and
   receives an SDP offer from an [RFC4975] conformant UA, NAT traversal
   can only be achieved if the UA supports ICE (and the network provides
   TURN servers) or if the network supports SBC assisted NAT traversal
   for TCP.


4.  The Alternative Connection Model for MSRP

4.1.  Transport connection addressing

   A UA SHALL follow the conventional use of address information
   received in the SDP c- and m-lines, for determining the transport
   connection endpoint address:port to connect to, instead of using the
   address information in the MSRP URI received in the a=path line to
   determine the remote transport connection endpoint address:port.

   With such usage, applying COMEDIA and ICE and TLS in SDP offer/answer
   exchanges for MSRP sessions can be done more or less in the
   conventional way with very little MSRP dependencies, as detailed in
   this document.  Furthermore, this usage also allows any ALG/SBC in
   the SIP signaling path to perform media anchoring in the same way
   they today do for any TCP connections not used for MSRP, i.e. by
   modifying the address:port information in the c- and m-lines, and
   ignoring any a=path line.

   When a UA sends an SDP offer, the MSRP URI in the a=path line of the
   SDP offer (and eventually in the MSRP FromPath header) does not need
   to include connection address information, it is recommended to
   instead include an AoR to avoid the possibility to use it for address
   resolution - the AoR may be useful for debugging purposes only.

   The usage of an AoR in the MSRP URI should work fine in SDP offers,
   even if the SDP answerer UA is conformant to [RFC4975], since in that

   case it will always be the SDP offerer that will establish the
   transport connection based on address information in the SDP answer -
   the MSRP URI matching will still work since this only requires the
   MSRP URIs in the a=path headers to be identical to the MSRP URIs in
   the MSRP protocol FromPath and ToPath headers.

   When a UA receives an SDP offer from an [RFC4975] conformant UE, it
   needs to populate the MSRP URI in the SDP answer (and eventually in
   the MSRP FromPath header) with an address or FQDN in accordance with
   [RFC4975].  In order for the SDP answerer to know whether this is
   necessary or not, a UA conformant to this document SHALL include, in
   SDP offers and answers, an "a=msrp-acm" attribute.  The presence of
   the attribute will also enable ALGs/SBCs to apply normal media
   anchoring procedures and need not act as MSRP B2BUAs.

   In accordance with [RFC4975], for an MSRP endpoint that receives TCP
   open requests to be able to use a common port for all MSRP transport
   connections, the initiator of an MSRP transport connection SHALL
   always after having established a new transport connection send an
   MSRP message, allowing the other endpoint to establish the binding
   between MSRP session and transport connection.

4.2.  COMEDIA usage

4.2.1.  a=setup

   A UA SHALL support the a=setup attribute [RFC4145], in order to
   negotiate which endpoint is to establish the transport connection for
   an MSRP session.

   The support of a=setup is particularly useful when one MSRP endpoint
   is a media server which is not behind a NAT.  This since the media
   server then make sure that transport connections for MSRP media is
   always set up from the UA towards the server, and ensure that
   possible NATs at user premises will not interfere with the connection
   setup.

   A UA SHALL always include an explicit a=setup line in SDP offers and
   answers, since it is sometimes useful for the other endpoint, or for
   the network, to know whether the sending endpoint supports a=setup or
   not.

   The a=setup "active", "actpass" and "passive" values SHALL be
   supported, while the "holdcon" value MUST NOT be used.

   Note: When the a=setup value is "actpass" or "passive", the IP
   address:port value in the SDP MUST contain the actual address:port on
   which the UA can receive a TCP Open request for the MSRP transport

   connection.

   If the a=setup value is "active", the port number value MUST either
   be the actual port number that will be used for the TCP endpoint or
   the port value 9.

   The a=setup "actpass" value SHALL be used in SDP offers whenever an
   UA can determine a valid WAN transport endpoint address:port, i.e. an
   address:port that the other endpoint can use as destination for a TCP
   Open request.  This is in order to a) allow the other endpoint to
   answer with "a=setup:active" if it is behind NAT, and b) to be
   compatible with MSRP endpoints that do not support COMEDIA and thus
   always will always act as passive endpoints.  If not the actual
   transport address can be provided then the a=setup "active" value
   MUST be used.

   A valid WAN transport address:port can be determined if the UA can
   determine that it is not located behind a NAT, or if the UA relays
   its MSRP transport connections via a TURN server, or if it through
   STUN signaling from the local port to be used for the eventual
   transport connection has used STUN to retrieve NAT address:port while
   also having determined that the NAT is not address restricted.

   If the UA is located behind a NAT, both SIP signaling and media
   transport will pass trough it, and a UA can determine whether the
   media transport will be NATed by inspecting the SIP Via header in the
   200 OK response to the initial REGISTER request, comparing the IP
   addresses in the Via sent-by and received parameters.  If these are
   not the same then there is a NAT in the path.

   If an SDP offer includes a=setup:actpass, the SDP answer MAY include
   a=setup:active, but SHOULD include a=setup:passive if the SDP
   answerer knows that it is not located behind a NAT.

4.2.2.  TLS

   If a TLS transport connection for MSRP is negotiated, the client and
   server TLS roles MUST negotiate the relevant parameter as specified
   by COMEDIA-TLS [RFC4572], and in accordance with [RFC4975] the MSRP
   URI scheme SHOULD be msrps and the m-line protocol indicator SHOULD
   be TCP/TLS/MSRP.

4.2.3.  a=connection

   The a=connection attribute is defined as a means for SDP negotiation
   of transport connection reuse.  However, it seems that its use is
   limited to mid-session SDP offer/answer exchanges while [RFC4976]
   requires initial SDP offer/answer exchanges to result in reuse of a

   transport connection established via another existing SIP session at
   the same UA, if the SDP for the remote endpoint of that connection
   indicates the same host address, port and URI scheme.

   A UA SHALL use a=connection lines for mid-session re-negotiation of
   transport connection for an MSRP session, but SHOULD not include any
   a=connection line in initial SDP offer/answer exchanges (if present,
   it SHALL be ignored by the receiving UA).  Instead the connection
   reuse principles for initial SDP offer/answer exchanges for an MSRP
   session SHALL be in accordance with [RFC4975].

4.3.  NAT keepalive

   An MSRP endpoint behind NAT MUST keep the NAT binding alive, in
   accordance with chapter 10 in [I.D.ietf-mmusic-ice].  The character
   string CRLF SHOULD be sent as NAT keepalive, but if the transport
   connection was established using ICE then STUN MAY alternatively be
   used.

4.4.  ICE usage

   A UA SHOULD support ICE [I.D.draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-tcp].  However,
   the UA SHALL when using ICE for MSRP transport connection
   establishment before starting to send any TCP Open requests perform
   the normal MSRP checks for possible reuse of an existing transport
   connection.  If such is identified, the UA SHOULD preempt ICE
   processing and send a new SIP offer which indicates a=connection:
   existing and the SDP information for the selected connection.


5.  Comparisons with draft-denis-simple-msrp-comedia

   The denis draft extends MSRP SDP with COMEDIA in much the same way as
   described in this document, but is somewhat looser in how COMEDIA can
   be used.  It does not for example mandate the usage of port 9 in SDP
   if not a valid receive port is indicated and it allows a UA that is
   not behind NAT to send an offer with a=setup:passive as an
   alternative to a=setup:actpass.

   The major differences between this draft and the denis draft,
   however, is that the denis draft:

   - only provides means for NAT traversal when there is a NAT only in
   front of one endpoint.

   - does not mention that for COMEDIA to be able to be used as a means
   for NAT traversal the UA must also support sending NAT keepalives.

   - does not discuss the a=connection attribute in relation to MSRP
   transport connection reuse between different SIP sessions

   - does not describe how ICE could be used for MSRP connection
   establishment (it does refer to an expired draft on this issue)

   - maintains the [RFC4975] model, using the MSRP URI for addressing
   purposes, which means that any procedures dependent on address
   information in SDP need to be special for MSRP, and any SBC in the
   session path must act as SDP aware MSRP B2BUAs.


6.  Security Considerations

   TBD


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document declares a new SDP attribute, "a=msrp-acm".
