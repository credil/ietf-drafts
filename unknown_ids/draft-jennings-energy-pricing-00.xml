    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines media types for representing the future
      price of energy in JSON. It also defines a way for a client device, such
      as an electric car, to discover a web server that can provide the future
      pricing for local electrical energy. This will allow the client device
      to make intelligent decisions about when to use energy. </t>

      <t>This draft is a very early skeleton of a draft to start discussion
      around this idea.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Overview">
      <t>Many uses of energy can be shifted in time. Consider charging an
      electric car. When the users plugs in a car at 9pm, they may not care
      when it actually charges, as long as it is ready at 8AM when they need
      to go to work. This is a classic real time problem and can be optimized
      as long as the charger for the car has relevant information about how
      long it will take to charge and the cost of electricity between the
      current time and the time when the task needs to be complete. </t>

      <t>This specification defines a simple JSON<xref
      target="RFC4627"></xref>media type to provide the cost of energy at
      future points of time. It is an array of objects in which each object
      contains the time a new price will come into effect and the price at
      that time. JSON also defines a well known URL on a web server so that an
      HTTP client can retrieve this data. Finally as a way to automatically
      discover the web server, this specification defines a DHCP option to
      provide the host name of the web server. </t>

      <t>Consider a typical residence with broadband internet and a
      residential gateway that gets its IP address via DHCP from the service
      provider. The service provider would provide the domain of the local
      power provider via DHCP. The residential gateway would get this and
      provide it in DHCP requests sent to the residential gateway. The
      residential gateway would also be able to override this, so if the
      consumer had arranged power from an alternative power provider, the name
      of that provider could be configured in the device. </t>

      <t>A device on the residential network, such as a dishwasher, could find
      the energy provider name via DHCP. The dishwasher would then make an
      HTTP GET request to the well known URI defined in this specification. In
      other words, it would do an HTTP GET to the
      /.well_known/energy-price.json and would receive back an
      energyprice+json media type. For example </t>

      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
{
"currency" : "USD",
"prices":[
    { "time": "2011-04-12T23:20:00.00Z", "price": "0.028" },

    { "time": "2011-04-12T23:22:00.00Z", "price": "0.021" }
]}]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>The above example shows a case where at 21:00 UTC, the price falls
      from 2.8 cents per KWh to 2.5 cents per KWh. </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Semantics">
      <t>Each media type carries a single JSON object that represents a set of
      prices and times. This object contains optional attributes described
      below and a mandatory array of one or more measurements.</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="validTill:">Time at which this data will become
          invalid. UTC time in RFC 3339 format. </t>

          <t hangText="currency:">Optional. Specify currency in ISO 4217 [REF]
          currency code. </t>

          <t hangText="prices:">Array of price change objects. Mandatory and
          there must be at least one object in the array. Objects MUST be
          ordered in this array by time. </t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Each price time object contains several attributes, some of which are
      optional and some of which are mandatory.</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="time:">Time this price becomes effective. UTC time in
          RFC 3339 format. </t>

          <t hangText="price:">Price per KWh starting. The cost of energy
          changes to this price at the time in this object and remains at this
          price until the time of the next object in the prices array. </t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Open Issue: What is the best representation for time?</t>

      <t>Open Issue: Is it OK that currency is optional?</t>

      <t>Open Issue: How many entries can the array have? It would be nice to
      have some maximum size. </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Well Known URL ">
      <t>A client that implements this specification uses the path
      "//.well-known/energy-price.json" for the resource name unless the
      client has been configured with an alternative path. </t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCP">
      <t>Open Issues: Is DHCP the best approach to discovery or would
      something else be better?</t>
