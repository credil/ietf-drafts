     Unifying Double Translation and Encapsulation for 4rd (4rd-U)
                    draft-despres-softwire-4rd-u-00

Abstract

   This document proposes a new packet format for IPv4 packets to
   traverse IPv6 networks.  Its purpose is to get, for Residual
   Deployment of public IPv4 across IPv6 networks (4rd), the best of
   Encapsulation and Double-translation solutions.  For this, it ensures
   end-to-end transparency of IPv6 networks to IPv4 packets, and makes
   it possible to configure existing IPv6 Operation & Management tools
   so that they operate also on IPv4 packets.

Internet-Draft  Unified Translation-Encapsulation for 4rd   October 2011


1.  Problem Statement

   Stateless solutions for Residual Deployment of public IPv4 addresses,
   shared and non-shared, across IPv6-only routing networks are have
   been found desirable by a number of operators (ref
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation]).  For this, two
   different IPv6 packet formats have been proposed by a number of
   contributors to convey IPv4 packets: one based on Encapsulation (e.g.
   in [I-D.murakami-softwire-4rd]), and one based on Double translation
   (e.g. in [I-D.xli-behave-divi-pd]).  Both have advantages of their
   own that this document proposes to combine in a unified approach
   (4rd-U).

   An important advantage of Encapsulation is that it fully preserves
   network transparency to IPv4 packets, while Double translation,
   because it is based on the IP/ICMP translation algorithm of [RFC6145]
   that works for single translations between IPv6 and IPv4, introduces
   limitations to network transparency :

   o  IPv4 options at the IP layer are not translated.

   o  The "don't fragment" bit of IPv4 (DF bit) is not translated.


   The first limitation, loss of IPv4 options, can be accepted for the
   following reasons: (1) IPv4 options are very rarely used; (2) they
   don't influence which applications are supported; (3) Error messages
   are available to inform sources that options they tried to use are
   not supported (an ICMP message of [RFC0792] means "something is wrong
   with the type code of the first option".)

   The second limitation, lack of preservation of the DF-bit by IPv4-
   IPv6 translators, is more problematic:

      Its origin is that IPv4 and IPv6 treat packet fragmentations
      differently.  In IPv4, sources hosts may fragment packets, and can
      also indicate, for each packet, whether they permit packet
      fragmentation in the network or not.  If DF = 1 packets that are
      too big for the next link to be traversed MUST be discarded.  If
      DF = 0, these packets MUST be fragmented and forwarded.  But, in
      IPv6, packets don't have DF bits.  They may be fragmented by
      source hosts, but MUST NOT be fragmented during network traversal.

Internet-Draft  Unified Translation-Encapsulation for 4rd   October 2011


      If an IPv4 packet having DF = 0 is too long to traverse an IPv6-
      only domain as a single translated packet, the IPv4-to-IPv6
      translator at domain entrance MUST forward it.  It then has to
      send it as several packets using the IPv6 Fragmentation extension.
      At domain exit, the IPv6-to-IPv4 translator cannot determine
      whether the original DF bit was 0 or 1: the original IPv4 packet
      MAY have been sent with DF = 1, and fragmented enough by its
      source to need no further fragmentation at domain entrance, or it
      MAY have been sent with DF = 0 and fragmented somewhere (by the
      source host and/or at domain entrance).  The original DF bit is
      therefore lost during domain traversal.

      Consequences of not complying end-to end with the IPv4-
      fragmentation specification may be limited, but there is no way to
      guarantee that they will be negligible.  If choice exists,
      solutions that avoid this risk should therefore be preferred.

   On the other hand, Double translation has a significant advantage
   over Encapsulation: a number of existing Operation & Maintenance
   tools that work for IPv6 can be configured to work also for IPv4,
   including if concerned with transport-layer ports.

   The problem is then to find a new mechanism, if it exists, that keeps
   the best of both proposed approaches: (1) end-to-end transparency to
   IPv4; (2) applicability of IPv6 Operation & Maintenance tools of the
   IPv6-only domain to IPv4 packets, including if concerned with ports.


2.  Proposed Unified Solution 4rd-U

   The (simple) idea of 4rd-U is to map IPv4 headers into IPv6 headers
   in which Fragmentation extensions are always present, and to code the
   IPv4 DF bit in Identification fields of these extensions.  Other than
   that, IPv4 payloads are taken as IPv6 payloads without any look at
   their contents.  Network transparency to the DF bit is thus be
   ensured, and ports of IPv4 packets are found by Operation &
   Maintenance tools as though they would be ports of real IPv6 packets.

   Figure 1 illustrates how 4rd-U packet formats compare with those of
   Double Translation based on RFC 6145 [RFC6145], and those of
   Encapsulation.

   Note that how IPv6 addresses are derived from IPv4 addresses, and
   conversely, is a complementary subject, discussed separately.  In
   case of shared IPv4 addresses, this derivation does involve
   transport-layer ports, and some ICMP processing, but this is is
   independent from the IPv6 packet format used to convey IPv4 packets.

   The 4rd-U packet format is illustrated in Figure 2, with D standing
   for DF.  The IPv6 flow Label should by default be set to 0.  All
   other fields can be determined by simple rules known by persons
   familiar with IPv4 and IPv6 packet formats.

3.  Conclusion

   This proposal is submitted to the Softwire WG as an informational
   contribution.

   The expectation is that it might be useful to reduce the set of
   specifications to be standardized.  No intellectual property right
   known by the author applies to it.
