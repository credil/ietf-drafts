This specification extends the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) to support un-encoded international characters in user names, passwords, mail addresses, message headers, and protocol-level textual error strings.
</t></abstract>
</front>
<middle>
<section title="Introduction">
<t>This specification extends <xref target="RFC1939">POP3</xref> using the
<xref target="RFC2449">POP3 Extension Mechanism</xref> to
permit un-encoded <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref> in headers as described in <xref target="RFC5335">Internationalized Email Headers</xref>.  It also adds a mechanism to support login names outside the ASCII character set, and a mechanism to support UTF-8 protocol-level error strings in a language appropriate for the user.</t>

<t>Within this specification, the term down-conversion refers to the  process of modifying a message containing <xref target="RFC5335">UTF8 headers</xref> or body parts with 8bit content-transfer-encoding as defined in <xref
target="RFC2045">MIME section 2.8</xref> into conforming 7-bit <xref target="RFC5322">Internet Message Format</xref> with <xref target="RFC2047">Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text</xref> and other 7-bit encodings.  Down-conversion is specified by <xref target="RFC5504">Downgrading mechanism for Email Address Internationalization</xref>.</t>

<section title="Conventions Used in this Document">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in 
<xref target="RFC2119">"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate
Requirement Levels"</xref>.</t>

<t>The formal syntax uses the <xref target="RFC5234">Augmented
Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)</xref> notation including the core rules
defined in Appendix B of RFC 5234.</t>

<t>In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
server respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to multiple
lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for editorial
clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol exchange.</t>

<t>POP3 allows most +OK and -ERR server responses to include
human-readable text that in some cases needs to be presented to the
user.  But that text is limited to ASCII by the <xref
target="RFC1939">POP3 specification</xref>.  The LANG capability and
command permit a POP3 client to negotiate which language the server
should use when sending human-readable text.</t>
    
<t>A server that advertises the LANG extension MUST use the language
"i-default" as described in <xref target="RFC2277"></xref> as its default
language until another supported language is negotiated by the client. 
A server MUST include "i-default" as one of its supported languages.</t>

<t>The LANG command requests that human-readable text included in all
subsequent +OK and -ERR responses be localized to a language matching
the language range argument as described by <xref
target="RFC4647"></xref>.  If the command succeeds, the server returns a
+OK response followed by a single space, the exact language tag
selected, another space, and the rest of the line is human-readable text
in the appropriate language.  This and subsequent protocol-level
human readable text is encoded in the UTF-8 charset.</t>

<t>If the command fails, the server returns an -ERR response and
subsequent human-readable response text continues to use the language
that was previously active (typically i-default).</t>

<t>The special "*" language range argument indicates a request
to use a language designated as preferred by the server administrator.  The preferred language MAY vary based on the currently active user.</t>

<t>If no argument is given and the POP3 server issues a positive response, then the response given is multi-line.  After the initial +OK, for each language tag the server supports, the POP3 server responds with a line for that language.  This line is called a "language listing".</t>

<t>In order to simplify parsing, all POP3 servers are required to use a certain format for language listings.  A language listing consists of the <xref
target="RFC4646">language tag</xref> of the message, optionally followed by a single space and a human readable description of the language in the language itself, using the UTF-8 charset.</t>

</t>
<t>This capability adds the "UTF8" command to POP3.  The UTF8 command
switches the session from ASCII to UTF8 mode.</t>

<section anchor="UTF8_Command" title="The UTF8 Command">
<t>The UTF8 command enables UTF8 mode.  The UTF8 command has no parameters.</t>
<t>Maildrops can natively store UTF8 or be limited to ASCII.  UTF8 mode has no effect on messages in an
ACII-only maildrop.  Messages in native-UTF8 maildrops can be ASCII
or UTF8 using <xref
target="RFC5335">internationalized headers</xref>
and/or 8bit content-transfer-encoding as defined in <xref
target="RFC2045">MIME section 2.8</xref>.
In UTF8 mode, both UTF8 and ASCII messages are sent to the client
as-is (without conversion).  When not in UTF8 mode, UTF8 messages in
a native UTF8 maildrop MUST be down-converted (downgraded) to comply with unextended POP and Internet Mail Format.  POP servers (unlike SMTP and Submit servers) are not required to use <xref target="RFC5504">Downgrading mechanism for Email Address Internationalization</xref>.</t>
<t>
Discussion: The main argument against a single required mechanism for downgrade by a POP server is that the only clients that have any use for
a standardized downgraded message (because they wish to interpret downgrade headers, for example) are ones that can support UTF8 and hence will issue the UTF8 command in the first place.  The counter argument to this is that non-UTF8 clients might be upgraded in the future; it's desirable for an upgraded client to be capable of interpreting prior downgraded messages in the local mail store, which is most likely if the messages were downgraded using one standardized procedure.</t>

<t>Therefore, while POP servers are not required to use the <xref target="RFC5504">Downgrading mechanism for Email Address Internationalization</xref>, there are advantages to them doing so.</t>

<t>Note that even in UTF8 mode, MIME binary content-transfer-encoding is still not permitted.</t>

<t>The octet count (size) of a message reported in a response to
the LIST command SHOULD match the actual number of octets sent in a
RETR response.  Sizes reported elsewhere, such as in STAT responses and
non-standardized free-form text in positive status indicators (following
"+OK") need not be accurate, but it is preferable if they are.</t>

<t>Clients MUST NOT issue the <xref target="RFC2595">STLS command</xref> after issuing UTF8; servers MAY (but are not required to) enforce this by rejecting with an "-ERR" response an STLS command issued subsequent to a successful UTF8 command.  (Because this is a protocol error as
opposed to a failure based on conditions, an <xref target="RFC2449">extended response code</xref> is not specified.)</t>

</section>


<section title="USER Argument to UTF8 Capability">
<t>If the USER argument is included with this capability, it indicates
that the server accepts UTF-8 user names and passwords and applies <xref
target="RFC4013">SASLprep</xref> to the arguments of the AUTH, USER, PASS and APOP commands.  A client that supports APOP and permits UTF-8 in user names or passwords MUST also implement <xref
target="RFC4013">SASLprep</xref> on the user name and password used to compute the APOP digest.</t>
<t>The client does not need to issue the UTF8 command prior to using UTF8 in authentication.  However, clients MUST NOT use UTF8 in USER, PASS, or APOP commands unless the USER argument is included with the UTF8 capability.</t>
<t>Use of UTF8 in the AUTH command is governed by the SASL mechanism.</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Issues with UTF-8 Header maildrop">
<t>When a POP3 server uses a UTF8-native maildrop, it is the responsibility
of the server to comply with the <xref target="RFC1939">POP3 base
specification</xref> and <xref target="RFC5322">Internet Message Format</xref> when not in UTF8 mode.  Mechanisms for 7-bit
downgrading to help comply with the standards are described in <xref
target="RFC5504">Downgrading mechanism for Email Address Internationalization</xref>.</t>

<?rfc needLines="4"?>
<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>This adds two new capabilities ("UTF8" and "LANG") to the <xref target="RFC2449">POP3 capability registry</xref>.</t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>The security considerations of <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref>
and <xref target="RFC4013">SASLprep</xref> apply to this specification,
particularly with respect to use of UTF-8 in user names and passwords.</t>

<t>The "LANG *" command can reveal the existence and preferred language of a user to an active attacker probing the system if the active language changes in response to the USER, PASS, or APOP commands prior to validating the user's credentials.  Servers MUST implement a configuration to prevent this exposure.</t>

<t>It is possible for a man-in-the-middle attacker to insert a LANG command in the command stream thus making protocol-level diagnostic responses unintelligible to the user.  A mechanism to integrity protect the session, such as <xref target="RFC2595">TLS</xref> can be used to defeat such attacks.</t>

<t>Modifying server authentication code (in this case, to support UTF8) needs to be done with care to avoid introducing vulnerabilities (for
example, in string parsing).</t>

<section title="Design Rationale">
<t>This non-normative section discusses the reasons behind some of the design choices in the above specification.</t>
<t>Having servers perform up-conversion so that, at a minimum, RFC2047-encoded words are decoded into UTF8 is tempting, since this is an area that clients often fail to correctly implement.  However, modifying messages breaks digital signatures, and would require servers to support arbitrary charset conversion.</t> 
<t>USER is optional because the implementation burden of <xref target="RFC4013">SASLprep</xref> is not well understood and mandating such support in all cases could negatively impact deployment.</t>
<t>Due to interoperability problems with RFC 2047 and limited deployment of RFC 2231, it is hoped these 7-bit encoding mechanisms can be deprecated in the future when UTF-8 header support becomes prevalent. </t>
<t>While it is possible to provide useful examples for language
negotiation without support for non-ASCII characters, it is
difficult to provide useful examples for commands specifically
designed to use the UTF-8 charset un-encoded when the document
format is limited to ASCII.  As a result, there are no plans to
provide examples for that part of the specification as long as this
remains an experimental proposal.  However, implementers of this
specification are encouraged to provide examples to the document
author for a future revision.</t> <t>While down-conversion of
native-UTF8 messages is mandatory in the absence of the UTF8
command, servers are not required to do so as specified in <xref
target="RFC5504">Downgrading Mechanism</xref>.  As clients are
upgraded with UTF8 support and the ability to intelligently handle
(e.g., display and reply to) UTF8 messages that were downgraded in
transit, it is better if they are also able to handle messages in
the local mail store that were downgraded by the POP server.  This
is more likely if the POP server downgrades messages using the same
mechanism as an SMTP server.</t>
