Internet-Draft            CAP MIME registration             October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) [cap] is an XML document format
   for exchanging emergency alerts and public warnings.  This document
   registers a media type for CAP documents.  The following is an
   example of a CAP message for a severe thunderstorm warning:
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    <alert xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:emergency:cap:1.1">
        <identifier>KSTO1055887203</identifier>

2.  IANA Considerations

2.1.  Registration of the 'application/common-alerting-protocol+xml'
      media type

   To:   ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject:   Registration of MIME media type application/ common-
      alerting-protocol+xml

   MIME media type name:   application

   MIME subtype name:   common-alerting-protocol+xml

   Required parameters:   (none)

   Optional parameters:   charset; Indicates the character encoding of
      the enclosed XML.  Default is UTF-8 [RFC3629].

   Security considerations:   Transmission of CAP payloads does not
      introduce new security risks

   Interoperability considerations:   CAP is widely used for emergency
      management.

   Published specification:   RFC XXX [Replace by the RFC number of this
      specification].

   Applications which use this media type:   Applications that convey
      alerts and early warnings according to the CAP standard.

   Additional information:   OASIS has published the Common Alerting
      Protocol specification [CAP].

   Person & email address to contact for further information:   Hannes
      Tschofenig, hannes.tschofenig@nsn.com

   Intended usage:   Limited use

   Author/Change controller:   IETF ATOCA working group

   Other information:   This media type is a specialization of
      application/xml [RFC3023], and many of the considerations
      described there also apply to application/ common-alerting-
      protocol+xml.

3.  Security Considerations

   The introduction of the CAP MIME type does not present any new risks
   in itself.  CAP messages are used to encode emergency alerts, which
   means that false CAP messages can have significant negative effects,
   such as the unnecessary evacuation of an area.  Systems that process
   CAP messages will need to have mechanisms for integrity protection
   and origin authentication, in order to ensure either that end alert
   recipients do not receive false alerts or that they can distinguish
   valid alerts from false alerts.
