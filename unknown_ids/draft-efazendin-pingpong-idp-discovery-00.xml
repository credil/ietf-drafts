                This specification defines an Identity Provider Discovery profile using long-term cookies in the user's
                browser, which are associated to the user's Identity Provider domain, and an iframe and javascript
                solution to reveal the existence of those cookies to Service Providers.

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                PingPong IdP Discovery is a protocol to discover an end-user's Identity Provider (IdP).  An IdP is an
                entity, or security domain, that is an authority for representing a user's identity.  They authenticate
                users and have records of users.  A Service Provider (SP) is an entity, or security domain, with web
                applications that end-users want to access but for which they don't have credentials registered to
                authenticate.  An IdP Discovery protocol is needed when a user attempts to access a protected resource
                at an SP, which supports Single Sign-on (SSO) with a trusted set of IdPs, and that user is
                unauthenticated to the SP and does not provides an SSO credential in the HTTP request.  In this
                scenario, the SP needs to discover the IdP that is the authority of the user to initiate an SSO
                transaction with that IdP.  This document describes an IdP Discovery protocol to support this use case.
            </t>
            <t>
                PingPong IdP Discovery is designed for use cases where there is a finite quantity of IdPs.  Although
                there are other potential terminating events, the user's browser may query, and therefore send an HTTP
                request to, every possible IdP for a given SP.  With a large number of IdPs, the end-user may find the
                amount of time required to query all IdPs to be unacceptable.  The number of SPs in a given SSO network
                (federation) does not impact the runtime processing of PingPong IdP Discovery. 
            </t>
            <t>
                Solutions to IdP Discovery have been addressed in previous protocol definitions.  These designs
                typically address the challenge by introducing a common domain.  Section 4.3 of
                <xref target='OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os'/> defines using DNS to establish a common DNS domain to let
                IdPs and SPs share cookie information by reading from and writing to sub-domains of the common domain.
                <xref target='SSTC-IdP-Discovery'/> defines a framework for redirecting a user's browser to a 3rd party
                hosted domain to perform IdP Discovery.  PingPong differs from these primarily by not requiring a common
                domain.  This model may be useful in use cases where the infrastructure requirements for managing a
                common domain is not possible or is something that would not easily scale as a federation grows.

            <t>
                PingPong IdP Discovery is designed to direct the user's browser to query IdPs to determine whether or
                not they have ever authenticated this user or, at least, a user in the given web browser context.  IdPs
                can determine the answer to this query quickly if they store a long-term cookie
                <xref target='httpstate'/> in the browser whenever it authenticates a user.  When the browser is
                directed to query the IdP, it will include this cookie in the HTTP request, so the IdP simply needs to
                look in the request to determine the answer.  Since a cookie can only be read by the domain from which
                it was written, the SP cannot read the IdP's cookie directly.  PingPong IdP Discovery defines the
                mechanism, using a combination of iframes <xref target='html5-iframe'/> and javascript
                <xref target='ecma-262'/>, for directing the browser to perform these queries to, potentially, all
                possible IdPs for a given SP and processing the responses.
            </t>
            <t>
                When an SP needs to determine the IdP of a user, the SP loads a series of iframes into the users
                browser.  The src of each iframe is to a particular IdP's PingHandler.  When an IdP receives an HTTP
                request to their PingHandler, they check to see if the request includes the cookie indicating a user in
                the given browser context has authenticated at that IdP in the past.  The IdP then responds with an HTTP
                302 redirect back to the SP's PongHandler.  Included in the query string of the redirect URL is a
                parameter which indicates whether or not that IdP saw their cookie indicating the previous
                authentication.  Both the Ping request and the Pong response are executed within the iframe, so the
                user's main browser window is never navigated away from the SP's web application.  Each Pong response is
                recorded server side at the SP and indexed using the user's browser session.
            </t>
            <t>
                While each iframe processes the Ping requests and the Pong responses, javascript in the browser
                periodically sends HTTP requests to the SP's PongStatus endpoint to determine what the browser should do
                next.  The response can indicate to the browser that it should wait, load more iframes, or present a
                link to the user's IdP.  Since all the Pong responses are recorded server side, the SP is in full
                control of the next logical step the browser should take.
            </t>

                    response is delivered to the SP via an HTTP 302 response returned to the browser from the Ping
                    request.

                    Since the Ping request is sent from the user's browser via an iframe, the main window of the user's

                    The Pong response is defined by the URI returned as the location header of the HTTP 302 response.
                    The URI of the Pong response is the combination of the value received from the Ping request in the
                    PongHandler query parameter plus an additional query parameter called authnedUser.  The value of
                    authnedUser is the literal <spanx style='verb'>true</spanx> or <spanx style='verb'>false</spanx>.

                The main responsibilities of the SP during PingPong IdP Discovery is to direct the user's browser to
                query a set of IdPs to determine if they have previously authenticated the user by using Ping requests
                and to process the Pong responses returned from the IdPs.

                        Before an SP can support PingPong IdP Discovery it will need to identify the IdP's it trusts as
                        authorities of users of the SP's web applications.  It will also need to receive the PingHandler
                        URI from the identified IdPs and store it for runtime processing.

                <t>
                    The SP creates and sends Ping requests through the user's browser.  This allows for browser data to
                    be transmitted directly to the PingHandlers at IdPs, and this method allows for sending the cookie,
                    if it exists, to the IdPs to allow them to determine the value to provide in the authnedUser
                    parameter of the Pong response.  The SP does this by loading iframes in the user's browser.  The src
                    of each iframe is the PingHandler URI of each IdP.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The URL of the Ping request MUST include a query parameter of PongHandler.  The value of the
                    PongHandler MUST be a URI, which is URL encoded, to the SP's Pong Handler.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The PongHandler URI sent to the IdP is of the following format:
                    <list style='hanging' hangIndent='6'>
                        <t>

                <t>
                    When the SP receives a Pong response from an IdP it will need to resolve from which IdP it was sent.
                    The SP SHOULD include a query parameter in the PongHandler &lt;query_string&gt; indicating the IdP
                    to which the Ping request was sent so, it will be able to identify the IdP when it sends the Pong
                    response.

                    context and return a Pong response to the SP with the answer.  This response will be delivered via a
                    302 redirect from the Ping request.  Since these two HTTP requests happen within an iframe, the
                    user's main browser window will not be affected.  The answer is communicated via a query parameter
                    called authnedUser, which is appended to the Pong Handler URI and is the literal
                    <spanx style='verb'>true</spanx> or <spanx style='verb'>false</spanx>.

                    While the browser is processing the iframes, it will need to periodically check back to the SP to
                    determine what it should do next.  This is done with requests sent back to the PongStatus service
                    endpoint hosted by the SP.  The requests are sent to the SP using an AJAX method via javascript.
                    The response from the PongStatus can indicate to the browser that it should wait, load more iframes,
                    or present a link to the user's IdP.

                    The following sections are considerations and recommendations for the SP implementation of PingPong
                    IdP Discovery.  Since these are implementation specific items and not directly related to the
                    communication between IdPs and SPs, these items are not required for PingPong IdP Discovery
                    conformance.

                    <t>
                        After PingPong IdP Discovery completes, the user invokes an SSO transaction, and the user
                        returns with a proper SSO credential, the SP SHOULD track this user's IdP for future reference.
                        Tracking the IdP will prevent the need to perform PingPong IdP Discovery in the future when the
                        user returns to the SP application unauthenticated.  The SP will be able to lookup the user's
                        IdP based on how it was stored after the user's last successful SSO transaction.  The method for
                        storing the user's IdP could be done in a variety of ways, but a cookie would be a valid method.

                        There will be some quantity of IdPs where PingPong IdP Discovery may take longer than an
                        acceptable amount of time for the end-user.  The number of IdPs that are too many is subjective
                        and will need to be determined by the SP, but given modern network speeds and end-user computing
                        capacity it could be on the order of 100s or maybe even 1000s.

                    <t>
                        In deployments where there is a relatively large number of IdPs, the SP SHOULD page through the
                        list of IdPs until one or more Pong responses indicate the user's IdP(s).  For example, if a
                        given SP supports 100 IdPs, the SP could attempt PingPong IdP Discovery with the first 20.  If
                        none of the first 20 return a successful response, the next 20 are then queried.  This paging
                        would continue until a Pong response is received that indicates the user's IdP or until all IdPs
                        have been queried and none have indicated they are the user's IdP.

                        prioritization mechanism to increase the possibility that the user's IdP is found early in the
                        PingPong IdP Discovery Process.  Prioritization and <xref target="Paging" format="title" /> are complementary.

                        possibility, the SP SHOULD implement a timeout period where it will treat the lack of response
                        from an IdP the same as it would if the IdP responded with a 'authnedUser=false'.

                    Given the potential that a rogue SP could initiate PingPong IdP Discovery to determine a user's IdP,
                    potentially for malicious reasons, the IdP SHOULD implement a whitelist of PongHandlers.  If a
                    whitelist is implemented, all Ping requests with a PongHandler value that is not included in the
                    whitelist MUST be discarded.  Responding to the Ping request with an HTTP 200 is an example method
                    of discarding the Ping request.

                    Both the IdP and SP SHOULD ensure that it is not possible for sensitive cookies, like a sessionid,
                    to be sent through an unencrypted channel.  This is especially important given that the IdP's
                    PingHandler service should be accessed via an unencrypted channel, which is recommended to improve
                    performance.  The long-term cookie the IdP uses to track the browsers in which it has authenticated
                    a user is not considered sensitive.
