    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In
      particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous, off-line report
      generation for performance monitoring on any device supporting 
      MIBs containing variables that resolve to type Integer32 
      (i.e., Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks).  
      This should be useful to devices or networks where efficient use
      of bandwidth is of concern or where intermittent connectivity
      is common.  Hence, the REPORT-MIB is useful for devices managed over
      some Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) or Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs).</t>

      <t>The REPORT-MIB offers three types of off-line reporting.  One type offering
      reports which present statistical analysis of the objects being
      tracked; found within the reportStatsGroup. The second type
      offering a means to collect sampled data related to defined
      MIB objects.  This second type of reporting is contained in 
      the reportSampledGroup.  The third offering
      reports which present (collect) raw data values and their
      time of change from the objects
      being tracked; found within the reportHistoryGroup.</t>

      <t>For statistical reporting, the REPORT-MIB borrows 
      from the RMON <xref target="RFC1757"></xref> ReportsControl and Reports Tables.
      Here the reportStatsCapabilitiesGroup defines the capabilities
      of the device with respect performance monitoring and
      statistical analysis.  Some analysis is hard-coded into
      the definition of the reportStatsDataGroup while the device
      can also advertise extended statistical reporting via the
      reportMetricExtDefTable.  The reportsControlTable 
      specifies the report metrics, the
      Object ID to monitor and other aspects of the statistical
      report development and storage.</t>

      <t>For the collection of sampled data, the REPORT-MIB
      draws directly from the usrHistoryGroup from RMON 2
      <xref target="RFC2021"></xref>.
      Here the reportSampledControlTable allows the user to
      define aspects of the report for sampled data, including
      the number of MIB objects to be sampled and the nature of the
      sampling frequency and overall report duration.  This
      group uses the notion of buckets, which contained sampled data
      from a set of idetified MIB objects sampled at the same time point.
      The report consists of the buckets each containing sets of sampled
      data from the same MIB objects but at differing sampling times.
      The reportSampledObjectTable allows the user to identify
      the multiple MIB objects to be sampled.  The reportSampledDataTable
      contains the storage of the reported sampled data contained within
      buckets, one for each sampling instance.</t>

      <t>For the collection of raw data, the REPORT-MIB
      contains a reportHistoryGroup comprised of the
      reportHistoryControlTable for control of historical data
      reports and the reportHistoryDataTable for the storage of the
      historical reports.</t>

      <t>Various compliance groups which allow for development of
      raw data collection reports, collection of sampled data
      reports or only statistical data
      reports, or all combinations.</t>

      Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC
      3410 <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
      the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
      accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects
      in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of
      Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB module that is
      compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 <xref
      target="RFC2578"></xref>, STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref
      target="RFC2579"></xref> and STD 58, RFC 2580 <xref

      <section title="REPORT-MIB Management Model">
        <t>This section describes the management model for the Reporting
        MIB process.  First, the model for the reportStatsGroup is presented.
        Then the model for the reportSampledGroup and the
        reportHistoryGroup are presented.</t>

        <t>Figure 1 illustrates a potential use of the REPORT-MIB
           for the generation of off-line, remotely generated reports.
           The management station on the left hand side of the illustration
           instructs the remote device to create reports through manipulation
           of the ReportCntrl Objects in the REPORT-MIB resident on the
           remote device.  The reports instruct the device to monitor the
           status of specified counters (on other MIBs) periodically
           and to generate a set of metrics describing the temporal
           behavior of those counter values.  The reports are stored locally
           until the management station decides to pull them off the
           device.  The figure shows a case where the REPORT-MIB generates
           a notification that Report_2 has completed, prompting the management
           station to pull Report_2 from the device.</t>

      <t>The REPORT-MIB's reportStatsGroup defines specifically a set of metrics which are
         computed within all reports.  It also allows for the specification
         of metric extensions which are local to the specific implementation
         of the REPORT-MIB.  These are identified in the reportStatsCapabilitiesGroup
         metricExtension Table.</t>

      <t>Each metric has an associated Object ID of type counter associated
         with it.  The control table specifies a report interval and a
         bin interval.  The report interval is an integral multiple
         of the bin interval.  For each bin interval, the device
         identifies the change in the counter value over the bin interval (called x_i)
         and then computes the associated metric, e.g., sum, sum of the square,
         etc, over the set {x_i}.  It maintains the sum of these computations within the metric
         objects in the 'reportStatsDataTable'.  Once the report interval
         is complete, the management station has enough information
         to compute a set of interesting and useful statistics.</t>

      <t>The computational model of the reportStatsGroup of the
         REPORT-MIB is illustrated in the figure below.
         The important controls are a) the contrlInterval, b) the cntrlBinInterval,
         c) the specific counterObjectId, and d) the metric.  In the figure
         x_i represents the ith value of the counter change, i.e.,
         x_i = counterValue(t_i+1) - counterValue(t_i).  The metrics reported
         are then computed from the set (x_i).  Three examples are identified
         in the figure, e.g., StatSumX, StatSumSq and StatMaxX.  Other existing and
         potential metrics are discussed below.</t>

      <t>The following observations and analysis techniques are not all
         inclusive.  Rather these are the ones we have come up with at the
         time of writing this document.</t>

         <t>Number - </t>

         <t>Frequency - </t>

         <t>The time interval is that specified in the control table.  It

            module.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>The REPORT-MIB also provides for the collection of sampled data
         instead of statistical data.  It does this by importing (copying)
         the usrHistory group from RMON2 
         <xref target="RFC2021"></xref> which allows for the
         generation of reports collecting the sampled object values binned
         for the purpose of aggregation and efficiency of collection.
         These are defined within the reportSampledGroup.  The model
         used for this type of report generation is based upon three
         tables.  The reportSampledControlTable defines aspects of the
         report generation related to duration of the reporting interval,
         the bin (or bucket) sizes for the report, and the number of object
         values collected for each bucket.  The reportUsrHistoryObjectTable
         identifies the specific MIB objects whose values and binned
         within the report.  And the reportSampledDataTable contains
         the binned data values collected for the report.</t>


      <t>The REPORT-MIB also provides for the collection of historical data
         instead of statistical or sampled data.  It does this by defining
         the reportHistoryControlTable for the control of the historical
         reports and the reportHistoryDataTable for the storage of the
         historical reports.</t>

           within the REPORT-MIB, consider the standard metric
           object 'reportStatsDataStatSumX'.  For each bin interval
           defined by the object reportCntrlReportsBinInterval, the
           change in the value of the counter pointed to by the Object ID
           reportCntrlReportsPriObjID is calculated.  Then this (delta) value
           is added to the current value of the value contained in the
           object 'reportStatsDataStatSumX'.  Then, if interested in
           computing the average change in this object (sampled each
           bin interval) for the duration of the report, the management
           station simply divides reportStatsDataStatSumX by
           reportStatsDataStatN.  Although this is a trivial
           example because the value of reportAggrReportStatSumX
           is simple the difference in the counter reportCntrolReportsPriObjID

        <t>The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB <xref target="RFC3418"></xref>
        is defined as being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply

        of the management entity and certain other system-wide data. The

      <section title="MIB modules required for IMPORTS">
        <t>[TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any
        module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a
        REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited someplace
        within the narrative sections. If there are imported items in the MIB
        module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not already cited, they
        can be cited in text here. Since relationships to other MIB modules

        Other examples include RFC2679 [RFC2679], RFC2680
        [RFC2680], and RFC3432 [RFC3432].  Although no
        specific metric is mandatory, implementations

-- REPORT-MIB Editors' Note: 
-- The reportSampledGroup is copied from the usrHistory
-- group documented in RMON2 [RFC2021].  We have perserved all of
-- the annotations and object descriptions, as any changes would
-- only diminish the quality of the development.  The only changes
-- made were to the naming of the objects themselves.  Here we have
-- merely prefixed the original names with 'report' and changed the
-- 'usrHistory' to 'Sampled' as we felt this better reflected the
-- the nature of the capability being offered by this group.
-- The remainder of this group development is essentially
-- copied from [RFC2021]:

--
-- Sampled Collection Group (reportSampledGroup)
--
-- The reportSampled group combines mechanisms seen in the alarm and
-- history groups to provide user-specified samplying collection,
-- utilizing two additional control tables and one additional data
-- table. This function has traditionally been done by NMS
-- applications, via periodic polling.  The reportSampled group allows
-- this task to be offloaded to a remote managed device.
--
-- Data (an ASN.1 INTEGER based object) is collected in the same
-- manner as any data table (e.g. etherHistoryTable) except
-- that the user specifies the MIB instances to be collected and their
-- sampling frequency. Objects are collected in 
-- bucket-groups, with the intent that all MIB
-- instances in the same bucket-group are collected as atomically as
-- possible by the remote managed device.
--
-- The reportSampledControlTable is a one-dimensional read-create table.
-- Each row configures a collection of sampling buckets; the creation of a
-- row in this table will cause one or more associated instances in
-- the reportSampledObjectTable to be created. The user specifies the
-- number of bucket elements (rows in the reportSampledObjectTable)
-- requested, as well as the number of buckets requested.
--
-- The reportSampledObjectTable is a 2-d read-write table.
-- Each row configures a single MIB instance to be collected.
-- All rows with the same major index constitute a bucket-group.
--
-- The reportSampledTable is a 3-d read-only table containing
-- the data of associated reportSampledControlEntries. Each
-- entry represents the value of a single MIB instance
-- during a specific sampling interval (or the rate of
-- change during the interval).
--
-- A sample value is stored in two objects - an absolute value and
-- a status object. This allows numbers from -(2G-1) to +4G to be
-- stored.  The status object also indicates whether a sample is
-- valid. This allows data collection to continue if periodic
-- retrieval of a particular instance fails for any reason.
--
-- Row Creation Order Relationships
--
-- The static nature of the reportSampledObjectTable creates
-- some row creation/modification issues. The rows in this
-- table need to be set before the associated
-- reportSampledControlEntry can be activated.
--
-- Note that the reportSampledObject entries associated with a
-- particular reportSampledControlEntry are not required to
-- be active before the control entry is activated. However,
-- the reportSampled data entries associated with an inactive
-- reportSampledObject entry will be inactive (i.e.
-- reportSampledValStatus == valueNotAvailable).

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <!--[TODO] Remember to consider security from the start. -->

      <t>[TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
      contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
      those modules. This section MUST be patterned after the latest approved
      template (available at http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).
      Remember that the objective is not to blindly copy text from the
      template, but rather to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and
      then state/document the result of this evaluation.</t>

      <t></t>

      <t>[TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
      include the following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
      with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such objects
      may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
      The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
      proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
      These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>[TODO] writable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive
          if abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
          security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
          example.</t>

          <t>[TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they
          are sensitive.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>[TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
      use the following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
      a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. So, if this MIB
      module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder
      can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct
      SNMP SET operations.</t>

      <t>[TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
      following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
      MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
      even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
      encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
      via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability: <list style="symbols">
          <t>[TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
          are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
          be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
          information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
          European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)</t>

          <t>[TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
          sensitive.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>[TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
      information should have. The following three boilerplate paragraphs
      should not be changed without very good reason. Changes will almost
      certainly require justification during IESG review.</t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
      if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
      and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
      module.</t>

      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
      provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>,
      section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
      mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
      RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
      cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to
      ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
      module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
      those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
      SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>[TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
      http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
      submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
      Considerations section. The requirements for this section vary depending
      what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section 3.5 for more
      information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module document.</t>

      <t>Option #2:</t>

      <t>Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
      requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and to
      record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry. When the assignment
      has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX" (here and in the
      MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove this note.</t>

      <t>Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
      MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual numbers.
      See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done in a draft
      MIB module.</t>

      <t>Option #3:</t>

         thank U. Herberg for his forcing additions to this MIB through
         his thoughtful consideration of performance monitoring
         requirements for other MIBs, e.g., NHDP and OLSR MIBs.</t>

    <!-- References Section -->

    <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
   references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
   normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
   The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

   The standard MIB boilerplate available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html includes lists of
   normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
   specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
   modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
   then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
   in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
   IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
   SHALL point to the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
   policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
   text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
   documents containing imported definitions (other those already
   mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
   Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD point to the most recent
version of the specification in question.

    <section title="Change Log ">
      <t>Changes from -01 to -02 draft.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Restructured the MIB somewhat to now offer the three
             reporting capabilities in increasing order of detail:
             a) statistical reports, b) sampled reports, and
             c) historical reports.</t>
          <t>Renamed the usrHistoryGroup and elements to
             samplingGroup.  This is in line with its actual capabilities.</t>
          <t>Added a new historyGroup which provides a history of change events.</t>
          <t>Updated the4 Conformance section to reflect the above changes and
             additions.  But did not yet run smilint to check MIB syntax.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>Changes from -00 to -01 draft.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Added (copied) the usrHistory group from RMON2 into the REPORT-MIB.</t>
          <t>Restructured the MIB to account for the inclusion of the
             reportSampledGroup.</t>
          <t>Dropped the reportCurReportsTable as this did not make sense within the
             context of the REPORT-MIB.</t>
          <t>Added the Compliance and Conformance material.  Defined several Compliance
             Groups to all for base implementations of the REPORT-MIB for only statistical
             reports, for only historical reports or for both.  Allow for enhanced
             implementations to address higher capacity issues and 
             extension to metric reporting for statistical reporting.</t>
          <t>Ran the MIB through the smilint checker and in the process corrected numerous
             typos, ommisions, TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS, IMPORTS, etc.</t>
          <t>Updated main text to reflect changes.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Open Issues">
      <t>This section contains the set of open issues related to the
      development and design of the REPORT-MIB. This section will not be present
      in the final version of the MIB and will be removed once all the open
      issues have been resolved.</t>

      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Need to add an index associated with object IDs of interest which
             are conatined within a table, e.g., IfPacketsIn in an InterfaceTable
             which is indexed by IfIndex.</t>

          <t>Specify the set of metrics for default support. Done.</t>

          <t>Clean up the Table indexing.  Specifically, what uniquely defines a report?</t>

          <t>Complete notification group.</t>

          <t>Complete conformance group. Done but not yet checked by smilint.</t>

          <t>Work on the relationship to other MIBs, IF-MIB, NHDP-MIB.</t>

          <t>Update the text of the document to reflect the final state of the MIB.</t>

          <t>Identify all objects requiring non-volatile storage in their
          DESCRIPTION clauses.</t>

          <t>Incorporate parameter relationship conditions into their
          DESCRIPTION clauses.</t>

          <t>Complete the security analysis and section.</t>

          <t>Cleanup all the [TODOs] from the MIB template.</t>
