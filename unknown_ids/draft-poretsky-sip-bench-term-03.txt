Abstract

   This document provides a terminology for benchmarking SIP performance
   in networking devices.  Terms are included for test components, test
   setup parameters, and performance benchmark metrics for black-box
   benchmarking of SIP networking devices.  The Performance Benchmark

Internet-Draft        SIP Benchmarking Terminology             July 2007


   Metrics are obtained for the SIP Control Plane and Media Plane.  The
   terms are intedned for use in a companion Methodology document for
   complete performance characterization of a device in a variety of
   network conditions making it possible to compare performance of
   different devices.  It is critical to provide Test Setup Parameters
   and a Methodology document for SIP performance benchmarking because
   SIP allows a wide range of configuration and operational conditions
   that can influence performance benchmark measurements.  It is
   necessary to have terminology and methodology standards to ensure
   that reported benchmarks have consistent definition and were obtained
   following the same procedures.  Benchmarks can be applied to compare
   performance of a variety of SIP networking devices.

Internet-Draft        SIP Benchmarking Terminology             July 2007


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119.  RFC
   2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the intent of
   standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this document
   uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track document.
   The term Throughput is defined in RFC 2544.

   Many SIP terms used in this document are defined in [Ro02].


2.  Introduction

   Service Providers are now planning Voice Over IP (VoIP) and
   Multimedia network deployments using the IETF developed Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [Ro02].  SIP is a signaling protocol
   originally intended to be used for the dynamic establishment,
   disconnection and alteration of streams of media between end users.
   As it has evolved it is being used for a growing number of
   applications.  Some of these applications do result in streams of
   media but instead create other services tailored to the end-users'
   immediate needs or preferences.

   VoIP with SIP has led to development of new networking devices
   including SIP Server, Session Border Controller, and SIP-Aware
   Stateful Firewall.  The mix of voice and IP functions in this variety
   of devices has produced inconsistencies in vendor reported
   performance metrics and has caused confusion in the service provider
   community.  SIP allows a wide range of configuration and operational
   conditions that can influence performance benchmark measurements.  It
   is important to be able to correlate a signalling measurement with
   the media plane measurements to determine the system performance.  As
   SIP has increased deployments, the need to benchmark the performance
   of SIP devices is increasingly important.

   When defining SIP performance benchmarks it is critical to also
   provide definitions for Test Setup Parameters and a corresponding
   Methodology document for SIP performance benchmarking.  This enables
   benchmarks to be understood, fairly compared, and repeatable.  The
   chosen benchmarking metrics and methodologies used to obtain those
   metrics should be based upon a common set of clearly defined
   terminology.  This document provides the benchmarking terms for
   performance benchmarking the SIP control and media planes.  Terms are
   included for Test Components, Test Setup Parameters, and Benchmarks.
   All benchmarks are black-box measurements of the SIP Control and
   Media Planes.  It is intended that these terms be used in a companion

   Methodology document.

   SIP is used to create a growing number of very different applications
   and features, some off which result in the creation of media streams,
   others of which do not.  The set of benchmarking terms provided in
   this document is intended for use with any of these.  SIP is
   frequently used to create streams of media.  The control plane and
   the media plane are treated as orthogonal in this document.  In order
   to characterize the performance of one or another application or
   feature it may be necessary to logically associate several of the
   benchmarking metrics provided here.  Benchmarks to be obtained and
   compared for different types of Devices Under test (DUTs) such as SIP
   Proxy Server, SBC, P-CSCF, Proxy Server paired with a Firewall/NAT
   device, and P-CSCF paired with a Firewall/NAT device.  Media
   benchmarks can also be made when testing Systems Under Test (SUTs).


3.  Term Definitions

3.1.  Protocol Components

3.1.1.  Session
   Definition:
      The combination of Signaling Plane and Media Plane protocol
      messages and processes that enable two or more participants to
      communicate.

   Discussion:
      SIP messages in the signaling plane can be used to create and
      manage applications for one or more end users.  Most commonly the
      application in question resembles a traditional telephone call.
      SIP is often used to create and manage media streams in suspport
      of applications that resemble traditional telephone service.  The
      prototype of these applications is a session - a collection of
      media streams under the control of SIP entities.  The application,
      and by extension, the session, has components in both the
      signaling plane and the media plane.  SIP includes definitions of
      a Call-ID, a dialogue and a transaction that support this
      application.A growing number of usages and applications do not
      require the creation of associated media.  The first such usage
      was the REGISTER.  Applications that use the IM and SUBSCRIBE/
      NOTIFY methods also do not require SIP to manage media streams.
      The terminology Invite-initiated Session (IS or I-Session) and
      Non-invite initiated Session (NIS or N-Session) are used to
      distinguish between these different usages.

Internet-Draft        SIP Benchmarking Terminology             July 2007



      A Session in the context of this document, is considered to be a
      vector with three components: (1) A component in the signaling
      plane (SIP messages), sess.sig (2) A media component in the media
      plane (RTP and SRTP streams for example), sess.med (3) A control
      component in the media plane (RTCP messages for example),
      sess.medc

      An I-Session is expected to have non-null sess.sig and sess.med
      components.  The use of control protocols in the media component
      is media dependent, thus the expected presence or absence of
      sess.medc is media dependent and test-case dependent.  An
      N-Session is expected to have a non-null sess.sig component, but
      null sess.med and sess.medc components.

      Packets in the Signaling Plane and Media Plane will be handled by
      different processes within the DUT.  They will take different
      paths within a SUT.  These different processes and paths may
      prooduce variations in performance.  The terminology and
      benchmarks defined in this document and the methodology for their
      use are designed to enable us to compare performance of the DUT/
      SUT with reference to the type of SIP-supported application it is
      handling.

      Note that one or more sessions can simultaneously exist between
      any participants.  This is represented as an array session[x].

      Sessions will be represented as a vector array with three
      components, as follows:
      session->
      session[x].sig, the signaling component
      session[x].medc, the media control component (e.g.  RTCP)
      session[x].med[y], an array of associated media streams (e.g.
      RTP, SRTP, RTSP, MSRP).  This media component may consist of zero
      or more media streams.

   Measurement Units:
      N/A.

   Issues:
      None.

3.1.2.  Signaling Plane
   Definition:
      The control plane in which SIP messages [Ro02] are exchanged
      between SIP Agents [Ro02] to establish a connection for media
      exchange.

      SIP messages are used to establish sessions in several ways:
      directly between two User Agents [Ro02], through a Proxy Server
      [Ro02], or through a series of Proxy Servers.  The Signaling Plane
      MUST include the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [Ha06].
      The Signaling Plane for a single Session is represented by
      session.sig.

   Measurement Units:
      N/A.

   Issues:
      None.

3.1.3.  Media Plane
   Definition:
      The data plane in which one or more media streams [sc02] and their
      associated media control protocols [Sc03] are exchanged after a
      media connection has been created by the exchange of signaling
      messages in the Signaling Plane.

   Discussion:
      Media may also be known as the the "payload" or "bearer channel".
      The Media Plane MUST include the media control protocol, if one is
      used, and the media stream(s).  Media is analagous Data.  Example
      media are audio, video, whiteboard, and instant messaging service.
      The media stream is described in the SDP of the Signaling Plane.
      The media for a single Session is represented by session.med.  The
      media control protocol is represented by session.medc.

   Discussion:  It is necessary to define the time period in which
      success and failure are determined.  For example, it may be that
      the DUT is operating slowly and that it takes several minutes for
      it to act so as to remove the resources associated with the media.

   Definition:
      Device in test topology that provides Denial-of-Service (DoS)

      Agents and Signalling Server

   Discussion:
      The SIP-Aware Stateful Firewall MAY be an internal component or
      function of the Session Server.  The SIP-Aware Stateful Firewall
      MAY be a standalone device.  If it is a standalone device it MUST
      be paired with a Signalling Server.  If it is a standalone device
      it MUST be benchmarked as a SUT.  SIP-Aware Stateful Firewalls MAY
      include Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality.  Ideally,
      the inclusion of the SIP-Aware Stateful Firewall as a SUT has no
      degradation to the measured performance benchmark metrics.

3.3.1.  IS Attempt
   Definition:
      An I-Session Attempt is an event in the Signaling Plane identified
      by the appearance of a new SIP Call-Id.

   Discussion:
      When successful, the Session Attempt results in the receipt of a
      200 OK SIP message and the creation of a Media Session,
      session.med.  This can be represented as a session.sig that
      produces a session.med and possibly a session.medc.  There can be
      various reasons why a Session Attempt is unsuccessful.  These
      include a lack of available ports on an element of the DUT/SUT or
      incorrect operation on the DUT/SUT.  Unuccessful IS Attempts are
      identified and counted by the Recorder.

   Definition:
      The time for the first SIP message with the session&pos;s Call-ID
      until the last message for the session with that Call-ID.

   Discussion:
      The last message may be from either the signaling or the media
      plane.  If it is in the media plane, sess.med(y) it means that
      some media resources continue to be associated with the session
      even after the final signalling messages associated with the
      session have been exchanged.  There can be a variety of causes for
      such a situation, including network and system latency as well as
      failures to correlate the state machines of the signalling and
      media processing functions in the system.
      The Session Duration configured on the Emulated Agent (EA) is the
      Intended Session Duration.  When benchmarking Session Capacity the
      value of the Intended Session Duration MUST be infinite for all
      sessions.

   Discussion:
      The Session Attempt Rate can cause variation in performance
      benchmark measurements.  Since this is the number of sessions
      configured on the Tester, some sessions may not be successfully
      established on the DUT.  A sessio may be either an IS or an NIS.
      For a fixed value of Session Attempt Rate, more stress may be
      incurred on the DUT/SUT when it processes sessions attempts and
      teardowns concurrently during each one-second interval.

      The Media Session Attempt Rate can cause variation in performance
      benchmark measurements.  This is the number of sessions configured
      on the Tester.  Some attempts may not result in successful
      sessions established on the DUT.  Media Sessions MUST be
      associated with an IS.  By including this definition we leave open
      the possibility that there may be an IS that does not include a
      media description.  In this document, however, we will assume that
      there is a one to one correspondence between IS session attempts

      call-ID in the case of an I-session.  Time is measured from when
      the EA sends the first non-INVITE message in the case of an NI-
      session.  Session Attempt Delay MUST be measured for every
      established session to calculate the average.  Session Attempt
      Delay MUST be measured at the Maximum Session Establishment Rate.

   Measurement Units:
      msec

   Issues:
      None.

   See Also:
      Maximum Session Establishment Rate

3.4.6.  Session Disconnect Delay
   Definition:
      The average time that a session stays in the disconnecting state.

   Discussion:
      Time is measured from when the Emulated Agent sends the BYE
      request.  Session Teardown Delay MUST be measured for every
      established session to calculate the average.  Session Attempt
      Delay MUST be measured with the rate of teardowns configured to
      the value of the Maximum Session Establishment Rate.
   Measurement Units:
      msec

   Issues:
      None.

   See Also:
      Maximum Session Establishment Rate

3.4.7.  Standing Sessions
   Definition:
      The number of Sessions currently established on the DUT/SUT at any
      instant.

   Discussion:
      The number of Standing Sessions is influenced by the Session
      Duration and the Session Attempt Rate.  Benchmarks MUST be
      reported with the maximum and average Standing Sessions for the
      DUT/SUT.  In order to determine the maximum and average Standing
      Sessions on the DUT/SUT for the duration of the test it is
      necessary to make periodic measurements of the number of Standing
      Sessions on the DUT/SUT.  The recommended value for the
      measurement period is 1 second.
   Measurement Units:
      Number of sessions

   Issues:
      None.

   See Also:
      Session Duration
      Session Rate
      Session Attempt Rate

3.4.8.  IM Rate
   Definition:
      Maximum number of IM messages completed successfully by the DUT/
      SUT.

   Discussion:
      For a UAS, the definition of success is the receipt of an IM
      request and the subsequent sending of a final response.
      For a UAC, the definition of success is the sending of an IM
      request and the receipt of a final response to it.  For a proxy,
      the definition of success is as follows:
      A.  the number of IM requests it receives from the upstream client
          MUST be equal to the number of IM requests it sent to the
          downstream server; and
      B.  the number of IM responses it receives from the downstream
          server MUST be equal to the number of IM requests sent to the
          downstream server; and
      C.  the number of IM responses it sends to the upstream client
          MUST be equal to the number of IM requests it received from
          the upstream client.

   Measurement Units:
      IM messages per second

   Issues:
      None.

   See Also:

3.4.9.  Presence Rate
   Definition:
      Maximum number of presence notifications sent out by the DUT/SUR
      acting as a Presence Agent [Ro04].

      The intent of this benchmark is to assess the throughput of a
      Presence Agent (PA, see [Ro04]).  The PA will accept subscriptions
      from watchers, and when the target of the subscription is
      registered with the PA (who is acting as a registrar), a
      notification is generated to the watcher.  This benchmark will use
      the presence event package as documented in [Ro04].  The Presence
      Rate will be less than or equal to the Registration Rate.
   Measurement Units:
      Presence Notifications Per Second

   See Also:
      Registration Rate.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA considerations.


5.  Security Considerations

   Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
   Internet or corporate networks as long as benchmarking is not
   performed on devices or systems connected to production networks.
   Security threats and how to counter these in SIP and the media layer
   is discussed in RFC3261, RFC3550, and RFC3711 and various other
   drafts.  This document attempts to formalize a set of common
   terminology for benchmarking SIP networks.
