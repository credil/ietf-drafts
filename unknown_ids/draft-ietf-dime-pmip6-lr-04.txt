        Diameter Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6 Localized Routing
                      draft-ietf-dime-pmip6-lr-04

Abstract

   In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the
   Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically
   tunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing.  The term
   "localized routing" refers to a method by which packets are routed
   directly by the MAG without involving the LMA.  In order to establish
   a localized routing session between two Mobile Access Gateways in a
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, two tasks must be accomplished:

   1.  The usage of localized routing must be authorized for both MAGs
       and

   2.  The address of the MAG to which the Correspondent Node (CN) is
       attached must be ascertained

   This document specifies how to accomplish these tasks using the
   Diameter protocol.

1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] allows the Mobility Access
   Gateway to optimize media delivery by locally routing packets within
   itself, avoiding tunneling them to the Mobile Node's Local Mobility
   Anchor.  This is referred to as "local routing" in RFC 5213.
   However, this mechanism is not applicable to the typical scenario in
   which the MN and CN are connected to different MAGs and are
   registered to different LMAs.  In this scenario (as described in
   [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip6-lr-ps]), the relevant information needed to
   set up a localized routing path (e.g., the addresses of the Mobile
   Access Gateways to which the MN and CN are respectively attached) is
   distributed between their respective Local Mobility Anchors.  This
   may complicate the setup and maintenance of localized routing.

   Therefore, in order to establish a localized routing path between the
   two Mobile Access Gateways, the Mobile Node's MAG must identify the
   LMA that is managing the Correspondent Node's traffic and then obtain
   the address of the Correspondent Node's MAG from that LMA.  In Proxy
   Mobile IPv6, the LMA to be assigned to the CN may be maintained as a
   configured entry in the Correspondent Node's policy profile located
   on an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server.
   However, there is no relevant work discussing how AAA-based
   mechanisms can be used by the Mobile Node's MAG or LMA to discover
   the address of the Correspondent Node's LMA during the setup of
   localized routing, The method by which the Mobile Node's MAG or LMA
   interacts with the Correspondent Node's LMA to identify the
   Correspondent Node's MAG is also unspecified.

   This document describes AAA support for the authorization and
   discovery of PMIPv6 mobility entities during localized routing.  In
   LMA discovery, Diameter [RFC3588] is used to authorize the localized
   routing service and provide the Mobile Node's MAG/LMA with
   information regarding the Correspondent Node's LMA.  In MAG
   discovery, AAA is used to determine whether Mobile Node's MAG is
   allowed to fetch the address of the Correspondent Node's MAG from the
   Correspondent Node's LMA.  If MAG discovery is successful, the
   Correspondent Node's LMA will respond to the Mobile Node's MAG with
   the address of the Correspondent Node's MAG.


2.  Solution Overview

   MAG/LMA discovery is a prerequisite to the establishment of a direct
   routing path between MAG1 and MAG2 (associated with MN1 and MN2
   respectively).  This document addresses how to resolve the
   destination MN's MAG by means of interaction between the LMA and the
   AAA server.  Figure 1 shows the reference architecture for Localized

   Routing Service Authorization.  This reference architecture assumes

   o  MN1 and MN2 belong to different LMAs or the same LMA.

   o  the MAG and LMA support Diameter client functionality.

        Figure 1: Localized Routing Service Authorization Reference
                               Architecture

   The interaction of the MAG and LMA with the AAA server according to
   the extension specified in this document considers the follows
   features:

   a.  The interaction of LMA1 with the AAA server is used to authorize
       the localized routing service and, if necessary, fetch the IP
       address of LMA2 ('a' in (Figure 1))

   b.  LMA2 interaction with the AAA server is used to determine whether
       MAG1 or LMA1 is allowed to obtain the IP address of MAG2 ('b' in
       (Figure 1))

   Note that if MN1 and MN2 are connected to different MAGs but share
   the same LMA the interaction between LMA1 interaction and the AAA
   server should be exactly the same as when MNs belong to MAGs under
   different LMAs.

3.  Localized Routing Service Authorization

   Localized Routing Service Authorization also can happen during the
   network access authentication procedure [RFC5779],i.e., before
   Localized routing is initialized.  In this case, the preauthorized
   pairs of LMA/prefix sets can be downloaded to Proxy Mobile IPv6
   entities during RFC5779 procedure.  Localized routing can be
   initiated once a destination of received packet matches to some of
   the prefixes received during RFC5779 procedure.

   Figure 2 shows a scenario where MAG1 acts as a Diameter client,
   processing the data packet from MN1 to MN2 and requesting
   authorization of localized routing.  In this scenario, MN1 and MN2
   are anchored to LMA1 and LMA2 respectively.  In order to setup a
   localized routing path with MAG2, MAG1 must first locate the entity
   that maintains the data required to setup the path (i.e., LMA2) by
   sending a Request message to LMA1.  Note that the discovery of LMA2
   is only done once; once LMA1 has obtained the address of LMA2 from
   AAA serer, LMA1 may associate address of LMA2 with the Mobile Node's
   cached data for future use (e.g., in the case of a handover).  The
   Diameter client in LMA1 sends an AA-Request (AAR) message to the
   Diameter server.  The message contains an instance of the MIP6-
   Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP ([RFC5447], Section 4.2.5) with the
   INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit (Section 7) set and an instance of
   the MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP ([RFC5447], Section 4.2.4) containing
   the IP address of MN2.

   The Diameter server checks if localized routing is allowed between
   MAG1 and MAG2 and if so, responds with an AA-Answer (AAA) message
   encapsulating an instance of the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP [RFC5779]
   containing the IP address and/or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
   of LMA2.  LMA1 then determines the IP address of LMA2 using the data
   returned in the MIP6-Agent-Info and responds to MAG1 with the address
   of LMA2.  MAG1 can verify whether both MAGs are under the same LMA by
   comparing LMA1 address with LMA2 address.  MAG1 then requests the
   address of MAG2 from LMA2 and uses that address to setup the
   localized routing path between itself and MAG2 via a Proxy Binding
   Update (PBU)/Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA) message exchange
   [RFC5213].

          Figure 2: MAG-initiated Localized Routing Authorization

   Figure 3 shows another scenario, in which the LMA1 acts as a Diameter
   client, processing the data packet from MN1 to MN2 and requesting the
   authorization of localized routing.  In this scenario, MN1 and MN2
   are anchored to LMA1 and LMA2 respectively.  In contrast with the
   signaling flow of Figure 2, the difference is that it is LMA1 instead
   of MAG1 which initiates the setup of the localized routing path.

   The Diameter client in LMA1 sends an AA-Request (AAR) message to the
   Diameter server.  The message contains an instance of the MIP6-
   Feature-Vector AVP ([RFC5447], Section 4.2.5) with the
   INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit set and an instance of the MIP6-Home-
   Link-Prefix AVP ([RFC5447], Section 4.2.4) containing the IP address
   of MN2.  The Diameter server checks if localized routing is allowed
   between MAG1 and MAG2 and if so, responds with an AA-Answer (AAA)
   message encapsulating an instance of the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP
   [RFC5779] containing the IP address and/or Fully Qualified Domain
   Name (FQDN) of LMA2.  LMA1 then determines the IP address of LMA2
   using the data returned in the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP and responds to
   MAG1 with the address of LMA2.

4.  Diameter Server Authorizes MAG Location Query

   Figure 5 shows a scenario in which LMA2 acts as a Diameter client,
   receiving MAG location request and requesting authorization for MAG
   location Query to the AAA server.  In this scenario, MN1 and MN2 are
   anchored to LMA1 and LMA2 respectively.  MAG1 or LMA1 has already
   known the recipient of localized routing is LMA2.  MAG1 or LMA may
   solicit LMA2 to look up the IP address of the MAG to which MN2 is
   currently attached (in this case, MAG2) by sending a Request message

   containing the IP addresses/HNPs of MN1 and MN2.  LMA2 validates the
   request from MAG1 by sending an AAR to the AAA server containing the
   IP address/HNP of MN1 (encapsulated in an instance of the MIP6-Home-
   Link-Prefix AVP) and an instance of the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP
   ([RFC5447], Section 4.2.5) with the INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit
   set.  If the authorization is successful, LMA2 then looks up the IP

      Figure 6: Use of a Diameter Redirect Agent to Support Localized
    Routing Service Authorization in Networks with Multiple AAA servers

   Referring to an architecture with multiple AAA servers (as
   illustrated in Figure 6), AAA1 may not maintain the LMA to be
   assigned to MN2 as a configured entry in the Correspondent Node's
   Policy profile, as AAA2 holds this information in its policy store.
   In such a case, AAA1 contacts a Diameter redirect agent [RFC3588] to

   request the AAA server being responsible for maintaining MN2's policy
   profile.  AAA2 checks if localized routing is allowed between MAG1
   and MAG2 and if so, responds with the IP address of LMA2
   corresponding to MN2 and sends the results back to LMA1 via AAA1.
   Details about the use of redirect agents in this context are beyond
   scope of this document.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the Diameter NASREQ [RFC4005] and
   Diameter Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5779] applications are also applicable
   to this document.

   The service authorization solicited by the MAG or the LMA relies upon
   the existing trust relationship between the MAG/LMA and the AAA
   server.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification specifies a new value in the Mobility Capability
   registry [RFC5447] for use with the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP:
   INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED (0x0000080000000000).

9.  Change Log

9.1.  draft-ietf-dime-pmip6-lr-03

   The following are the major changes compared to previous version 02:

   o  Allow return the LMA address in all cases.

   o  Using localized routing for terminology consistency.

   o  Allow localized routing service authorization before localized
      routing is initialized.

   o  Treat MAGs under the different LMA in the same way as the MAGs
      under the same LMA.

   o  Get rid of references to individual drafts and only get alignment
      with Localized routing PS document.

9.2.  draft-ietf-dime-pmip6-lr-04

   The following are the major changes compared to previous version 03:

   o  Move the last paragraph in section 3 to the first paragraph.

   o  Using "request" rather than "localized routing optimization
      request".

   o  Using "respond" rather than "localized routing optimization
      response".

   o  Remove the informative reference to [I-D.wu-netext-local-ro].

   o  Using "discovery" rather than "resolution".

   o  Section 5 Fix Typo: "LMA"->"LMA2".
