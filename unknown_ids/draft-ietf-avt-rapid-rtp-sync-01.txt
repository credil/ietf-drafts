   discusses how rapidly such synchronisation can occur.  We show that
   most RTP sessions can be synchronised immediately, but that the use
   of video switching multipoint conference units (MCUs) or large source
   specific multicast (SSM) groups can greatly increase the initial
   synchronisation delay.  This increase in delay can be unacceptable to
   some applications that use layered and/or multi-description codecs.

   This memo introduces several mechanisms to reduce the initial
   synchronisation delay for multimedia sessions.  It updates the RTP
   Control Protocol (RTCP) timing rules to reduce the initial
   synchronisation delay for SSM sessions.  A new feedback packet is
   defined for use with the Extended RTP Profile for RTCP-based Feedback
   (RTP/AVPF), allowing video switching MCUs to rapidly request
   resynchronisation.  Two new RTP header extensions are defined to
   allow rapid synchronisation of late joiners, and guarantee correct
   timestamp based decoding order recovery for layered codecs in the
   presence of clock skew.  Therefore, a synchronized insertion of RTP
   header extensions is recommended.

Internet-Draft             RTP Synchronisation                  May 2009


1.  Introduction

   When using RTP to deliver multimedia content it's often necessary to
   synchronise playout of audio and video components of a presentation.
   This is achieved using information contained in RTP Control Protocol
   (RTCP) Sender Report (SR) packets [1].  These are sent periodically,
   and the components of a multimedia session cannot be synchronised
   until sufficient RTCP SR packets have been received for each RTP flow
   to allow the receiver to establish mappings between the media clock
   used for each RTP flow, and the common (NTP-format) clock used to
   establish synchronisation.  In the following, we refer to either SSRC
   multiplexed or session multiplexed RTP streams as RTP flows in
   general.

   Recently, concern has been expressed that this synchronisation delay
   is problematic for some applications, for example those using layered
   or multi-description video coding.  This memo reviews the operations
   of RTP synchronisation, and describes the synchronisation delay that
   can be expected.  Two backwards compatible extensions to the basic
   RTP synchronisation mechanism are proposed:

   o  An enhancement to the Extended RTP Profile for RTCP-based Feedback
      (RTP/AVPF) [2] is defined to allow receivers to request additional
      RTCP SR packets, providing the metadata needed to synchronise RTP
      flows.  This can reduce the synchronisation delay when joining
      sessions with large RTCP reporting intervals, or in the presence
      of packet loss.

   o  Two RTP header extensions are defined, to deliver synchronisation
      metadata in-band with RTP data packets.  These extensions provide
      synchronisation metadata that is aligned with RTP data packets,
      and so eliminate the need to estimate clock-skew between flows
      before synchronisation.  They can also reduce the need to receive
      RTCP SR packets before synchronising flows.

   The immediate use-case for these extensions is to reduce the delay
   due to synchronisation when joining a layered video session (e.g. an
   H.264/SVC session in NI-T mode [7]).  The extensions are not specific
   to layered coding, however, and can be used in any environment when
   synchronisation latency is an issue.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

Internet-Draft             RTP Synchronisation                  May 2009


2.  Synchronisation of RTP Flows

   RTP flows are synchronised by receivers based on information that is
   contained in RTCP SR packets generated by senders (specifically, the
   NTP and RTP timestamps).  Each type of media (e.g. audio or video) is
   sent in a separate RTP session, and the receiver associates RTP flows
   to be synchronised by means of the canonical end-point identifier
   (CNAME) item included in the RTCP Source Description (SDES) packets
   generated by the sender.  To ensure synchronisation, an RTP sender
   MUST therefore send periodic compound RTCP packets following Section
   6 of RFC 3550 [1].

   The timing of these periodic compound RTCP packets will depend on the
   number of members in each RTP session, the fraction of those that are
   sending data, the session bandwidth, the configured RTCP bandwidth
   fraction, and whether the session is multicast or unicast (see RFC
   3550 Section 6.2 for details).  In summary, RTCP control traffic is
   allocated a small fraction, generally 5%, of the session bandwidth,
   and of that fraction, one quarter is allocated to active RTP senders,
   while receivers use the remaining three quarters (these fractions can
   be configured via SDP [8]).  Each member of an RTP session derives an
   RTCP reporting interval based on these fractions, whether the session
   is multicast or unicast, the number of members it has observed, and
   whether it is actively sending data or not.  It then sends a compound
   RTCP packet on average once per reporting interval (the actual packet
   transmission time is randomised in the range [0.5 ... 1.5] times the
   reporting interval to avoid synchronisation of reports).

   A minimum reporting interval of 5 seconds is RECOMMENDED, except that
   the delay before sending the initial report "MAY be set to half the
   minimum interval to allow quicker notification that the new
   participant is present" [1].  Also, for unicast sessions, "the delay
   before sending the initial compound RTCP packet MAY be zero" [1].  In
   addition, for unicast sessions, and for active senders in a multicast
   session, the fixed minimum reporting interval MAY be scaled to "360
   divided by the session bandwidth in kilobits/second.  This minimum is
   smaller than 5 seconds for bandwidths greater than 72 kb/s." [1]

2.1.  Initial Synchronisation Delay

   A multimedia session comprises a set of concurrent RTP sessions among
   a common group of participants, using one RTP session for each media
   type.  For example, a videoconference (which is a multimedia session)
   might contain an audio RTP session and a video RTP session.  To allow
   a receiver to synchronise the components of a multimedia session, a
   compound RTCP packet containing an RTCP SR packet and an RTCP SDES
   packet with a CNAME item MUST be sent to each of the RTP sessions in
   the multimedia session.  A receiver cannot synchronise playout across

Internet-Draft             RTP Synchronisation                  May 2009


   the multimedia session until such RTCP packets have been received on
   all of the component RTP sessions.  If there is no packet loss, this
   gives an expected initial synchronisation delay equal to the average
   time taken to receive the first RTCP packet in the RTP session with
   the longest RTCP reporting interval.  This will vary between unicast
   and multicast RTP sessions.

2.1.1.  Unicast Sessions

   For unicast multimedia sessions, senders SHOULD transmit an initial
   compound RTCP packet (containing an RTCP SR packet and an RTCP SDES
   packet with a CNAME item) immediately on joining each RTP session in
   the multimedia session.  The individual RTP sessions are considered
   to be joined once any in-band signalling for NAT traversal (e.g. [9])
   and/or security keying (e.g. [10],[11]) has concluded, and the media
   path is open.  This implies that the initial RTCP packet is sent in
   parallel with the first data packet following the guidance in RFC
   3550 that "the delay before sending the initial compound RTCP packet
   MAY be zero" and, in the absence of any packet loss, flows can be
   synchronised immediately.

   Note that NAT pinholes, firewall holes, quality-of-service, and media
   security keys should have been negotiated as part of the signalling,
   whether in-band or out-of-band, before the first RTCP packet is sent.
   This should ensure that any middleboxes are ready to accept traffic,
   and reduce the likelihood that the initial RTCP packet will be lost.

2.1.2.  Source Specific Multicast (SSM) Sessions

   For multicast sessions, the delay before sending the initial RTCP
   packet, and hence the synchronisation delay, varies with the session
   bandwidth and the number of members in the session.  For a multicast
   multimedia session, the average synchronisation delay will depend on
   the slowest of the component RTP sessions; this will generally be the
   session with the lowest bandwidth (assuming all the RTP sessions have
   the same number of members).

   When sending to a multicast group, the reduced minimum RTCP reporting
   interval of 360 seconds divided by the session bandwidth in kilobits
   per second [1] should be used when synchronisation latency is likely
   to be an issue.  Also, as usual, the reporting interval is halved for
   the first RTCP packet.  Depending on the session bandwidth and the
   number of members, this gives the following average synchronisation
   delays:

   Figure 1: Average RTCP Reporting Interval (seconds)

   These numbers assume a source specific multicast channel with a
   single active sender, which the rules in RFC 3550 section 6.3 give a
   fixed fraction of the RTCP bandwidth irrespective of the number of
   receivers.  It can be seen that they are sufficient for lip-
   synchronisation without excessive delay, but might be viewed as
   having too much latency for synchronising parts of a layered video
   stream.

   The RTCP interval is randomised in the usual manner, so the minimum
   synchronisation delay will be half these intervals, and the maximum
   delay will be 1.5 times these intervals.  Note also that these RTCP
   intervals are calculated assuming perfect knowledge of the number of
   members in the session.  In practice, an implementation will have
   only limited knowledge of the size of the session when joining, and
   will likely send its initial report early compared to these values,
   following the RTCP reconsideration rules.

2.1.3.  Any Source Multicast (ASM) Sessions

   (tbd)

   For ASM sessions, the fraction of members that are senders plays an
   important role, and imply more variation in average RTCP reporting
   interval.

2.1.4.  Discussion

   For unicast sessions, the existing RTCP SR-based mechanism allows for
   immediate synchronisation, provided the initial RTCP packet is not
   lost.

   For SSM sessions, the initial synchronisation delay is sufficient for

Internet-Draft             RTP Synchronisation                  May 2009


   lip-synchronisation, but may be larger than desired for some layered
   codecs.  The rationale for not sending immediate RTCP packets for
   multicast groups is to avoid implosion of requests when large numbers
   of members simultaneously join the group ("flash crowd").  This is
   not an issue for SSM senders, since there can be at most one sender,
   so it might be desirable to allow SSM senders to send an immediate
   RTCP SR on joining a session (as is currently allowed for unicast
   sessions, which also don't suffer from the implosion problem).  SSM
   receivers using unicast feedback would not be allowed to send
   immediate RTCP.  This would be a change to RFC 3550, if accepted.

   For ASM session... (tbd)

   In all cases, it is possible that the initial RTCP SR packet is lost.
   In this case, the receiver will not be able to synchronise the media
   until the reporting interval has passed, and the next RTCP SR packet
   is sent.  This is undesirable.  Section 3.1 defines a new RTP/AVPF
   transport layer feedback message to request an RTCP SR be generated,
   allowing rapid resynchronisation in the case of packet loss.

2.2.  Synchronisation for Late Joiners

   Synchronisation between RTP sessions is potentially slower for late
   joiners, than for participants present at the start of the session.
   The reasons for this are two-fold:

   1.  Many of the optimisations that allow rapid transmission of RTCP
       SR packets apply only at the start of a session.  This implies
       that a new participant may have to wait a complete RTCP reporting
       interval for each session before receiving the necessary data to
       synchronise media streams.  This might potentially take several
       seconds, depending on the configured session bandwidth and the
       number of participants.

   2.  Additional synchronisation delay comes from the nature of the
       RTCP timing rules.  Packets are generated on average once per
       reporting interval but with the exact transmission times being
       randomised +/- 50% to avoid synchronisation of reports.  This is
       important to avoid network congestion in multicast sessions, but
       does mean that the timing of RTCP SR reports for different RTP
       sessions aren't synchronised.  Accordingly, a receiver must
       estimate the skew on the NTP-format clock in order to align RTP
       timestamps across sessions.  This estimation is an essential part
       of an RTP synchronisation implementation, and can be done exactly
       given sufficient reports.  Collecting sufficient RTCP SR data to
       perform this estimation, however, may require several reports,
       further increasing the synchronisation delay.

   These delays are likely an issue for tuning in to an ongoing
   multicast RTP session, or for video switching MCUs.


3.  Reducing RTP Synchronisation Delays

   Two backwards compatible RTP extensions are defined to reduce the
   possible synchronisation delay: a rapid resynchronisation request
   message, and RTP header extensions that can convey synchronisation
   metadata in-band.

3.1.  Rapid Resynchronisation Request

   The general format of an RTP/AVPF transport layer feedback message is
   shown below.

   A new feedback message type, RTCP-SR-REQ, is defined with FMT = 5.
   This MAY be sent to indicate that a receiver is unable to synchronise
   media streams, and desires that the media source send an RTCP SR
   packet as soon as possible (within the constraints of the RTCP early
   feedback rules).  On receipt of this, the media source SHOULD
   generate an RTCP SR packet as soon as possible within the RTCP early
   feedback rules.  That RTCP SR packet MAY be sent as a non-compound
   RTCP packet, if this has been negotiated.

   The Feedback Control Information (FCI) part of the packet is emtpy.
   The SSRC of packet sender indicates the member that is unable to
   synchronise media streams, while the SSRC of media source indicates
   the sender of the media it is unable to synchronise.  The length MUST
   equal 2.

   (tbd: discuss what happens if the feedback target is not co-located
   with the sender)

3.2.  In-band Delivery of Synchronisation Metadata

   The RTP header extension mechanism defined in [4] can be adopted to
   carry an OPTIONAL NTP format wall clock timestamp in RTP data
   packets.  If such a timestamp is included, it MUST correspond to the
   same time instant as the RTP timestamp in the packet's header, and
   MUST be derived from the same clock used to generate the NTP format
   timestamps included in RTCP SR packets.  The receiver can use the
   information provided as input to the synchronisation algorithm, as-if
   an RTCP SR packet had been received for the flow.

   Two variants are defined for this header extension.  The first
   variant extends the RTP header with a 64 bit NTP timestamp format
   timestamp as defined in [5].  The second variant carries the lower 24
   bit part of the Seconds of a NTP timestamp format timestamp and the
   32 bit of the Fraction of a NTP timestamp format timestamp.  The
   formats of the two variants are shown below.

   An NTP timestamp format timestamp MAY be included on any RTP packets
   the sender chooses, but it is RECOMMENDED when performing timestamp
   based decoding order recovery for layered codecs transported in
   multiple RTP flows, as further specified in Section 4.2.  This header
   extension MAY be also sent on the RTP packets corresponding to a
   video random access point, and on the associated audio packets, to
   allow rapid synchronisation for late joiners and in video switching
   scenarios.

   Note: The inclusion of an RTP header extension will reduce the
   efficiency of RTP header compression, if it is used.  Furthermore,
   middle boxes which do not understand the header extensions may remove
   them or may not update the content according to this memo.

   In all cases, irrespective of whether in-band NTP timestamp format
   timestamps are included or not, regular RTCP SR packets MUST be sent
   to provide backwards compatibility with receivers that synchronize
   RTP flows according to [1].  The sender reports are also required to
   receive the upper 8 bit of the Seconds of the NTP timestamp format
   timestamp not included in the Variant B/56-bit NTP RTP header
   extension (although this may generally be inferred from context).

3.3.  Signalling

   When the SDP is used, the use of the RTP header extensions defined
   above MUST be indicated as specified in [4].  Therefore the following
   URIs MUST be used:

   The URI used for signaling the use of Variant A/64-bit NTP RTP header
   extension in SDP is:  "urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:ntp-64".

   The URI used for signaling the use of Variant B/56-bit NTP RTP header

4.  Application to Decoding Order Recovery in Layered Codecs

   Based on the timestamp contained in each RTP data packet, and the
   mapping to an NTP format wallclock time, a decoding order recovery
   process may be applied if a media as result of a layered coding
   process is transported in multiple RTP flows.  This recovers the
   decoding order of media frames or samples at the receiver.
   Especially when transporting layered video, the decoding order
   recovery process is not straight forward.  In this section, we
   provide guidance on how to use RTP/NTP timing information for
   decoding order recovery.

4.1.  Problem description

   One option for decoding order recovery in layered codecs is to use
   the NTP/sample presentation timestamps to reorder data of the same
   layered media transported in multiple RTP flows.  For a timestamp-
   based decoding order recovery process, it is crucial to allow exact
   alignment of media frames respectively samples using the NTP timing
   information.

   In the presence of clock skew in used clock for wallclock timestamp
   generation, it may not be possible to derive exact matching NTP
   timestamps using the NTP format wallclock in each RTP flow's RTCP
   sender reports.  This is due to the fact that RTCP sender reports are
   not sent at the same point of time in the multiple RTP flows
   transporting data of the same layered media, while having a skew
   between those wallclock samples in the RTP flows RTCP sender reports.
   If the RTCP SR packets are not send synchronously in the multiple RTP
   flows, they therefore do not contain the same NTP wallclock
   timestamp.  If there is a skew present in the clock used for NTP
   wallclock timestamp generation, using different wallclock timestamps
   for the same sampling instance in the RTP flow inevitably leads to
   non-matching NTP timestamps generated from RTP timestamps and
   wallclock timestamp in the multiple RTP flows.  In order to allow a
   common and straight forward timestamp-based decoding order recovery
   process, it is important to guarantee exact matching of NTP
   timestamps.  Thus in the presence of non-perfect clocks, which should
   be the normal case, an additional mechanism SHALL be used.  An exact
   inter-flow alignment of NTP timestamps can be guaranteed, if an RTP
   header extension containing an NTP timestamp is always inserted at



Perkins & Schierl       Expires November 8, 2009               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft             RTP Synchronisation                  May 2009


   the same timing position in all the RTP flows in question, and if
   those NTP header extensions are used to update the NTP-RTP relation
   in all RTP flows at the same point of time.  This is called
   synchronous insertion of RTP header extensions in the following.

4.2.  Using RTP Header Extensions for decoding order recovery:
      synchronous insertion

   The RTP header extension to convey an NTP timestamp SHOULD be used
   with a layered, multi-description, or multi-view codec, to provide
   exact matching of NTP timestamps between layers, descriptions, or
   views transported in different RTP flows to allow timestamp-based
   decoding order recovery.  If this header extension is inserted for
   RTP flows transporting samples or parts of samples of the same
   layered media, it SHALL be included at least once in each of the RTP
   flows of the same media for the sampling time instance of an
   insertion of an RTP header extension.  Such synchronously inserted
   RTP header extensions SHALL contain the same NTP format wallclock
   timestamp.  The frequency of inserting the header extensions in the
   RTP flows is up to the sender, but it should be noticed that higher
   insertion frequencies obviously lead to higher synchronization
   frequencies.  For use cases where the same clock source has been used
   to generate the RTP timestamps in the multiple RTP flows, an
   application MAY rely on the RTP timestamps only for decoding order
   recovery starting from the point of synchronous insertion of the RTP
   header extensions containing NTP timestamps.

   Note: If the decoding order of RTP flows is given by any means (as
   e.g., for RTP session by mechanism defined in [6]), the NTP timestamp
   provided by the header extension allows to collect data of the same
   sample from the RTP flows, forming the sample decoding order.  There
   may be future mechanism to allow indication of dependencies of RTP
   flows transported as RTP streams using SSRC multiplexing

   It is RECOMMENDED that the receiver uses for timestamp-based decoding
   order recovery the NTP timestamps provided in the RTP header
   extensions only, if such extensions are present for the RTP flows.
   Section 4.3 gives further details about the timestamp-based decoding
   order recovery.

   Note: Using the RTP header extensions described above allows the
   receiver to find the corresponding sample of the layered media, or
   parts thereof, in all RTP flows at the instant the RTP header
   extension is inserted into the flows.  This guarantees that any clock
   skew present in the NTP timestamp generation process based on RTCP
   sender reports is avoided, and so allows direct comparison of NTP
   timestamps across multiple RTP flows.  Furthermore, this approach
   solves the possible problem of clock skews identified for the NI-T



Perkins & Schierl       Expires November 8, 2009               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft             RTP Synchronisation                  May 2009


   mode as defined in [7].  To ensure the absence of clock skew, a
   header extension containing the NTP timestamp MUST be inserted into
   the RTP flows comprising a layered media stream at the same instant
   in each RTP flow.  This may require the insertion of extra packets in
   some of the RTP flows, since in layered video codecs not all sampling
   instances may be present in all the flows.  If such a header
   extension is included in all flows at a sampling time instance, the
   NTP timestamps for samples following in decoding order the RTP header
   insertion point can be constructed using the RTP timestamps and
   identical reference NTP timestamps in the NTP header extension in all
   RTP flows.  It should be noted that the frequency of inserting the
   RTP header extension containing the NTP timestamp is crucial in
   presence of clock skew, since the points of insertion may be the only
   points for a receiver to start the decoding order recovery.

4.3.  Timestamp based decoding order recovery

   If parts or complete samples as result of a layered coding process
   are transported as different RTP flows, i.e. as different RTP
   streams, and/or as different RTP sessions, a decoding order recovery
   process is required to reorder the samples or parts of samples
   received.  Such mechanism may be based on the NTP presentation
   timestamp which can be derived from the RTP timestamp using the NTP
   wallclock provided in the RTCP sender report packets.

   In order to guarantee the exact alignment of those derived NTP
   presentation timestamps, the RTP header extension as defined in this
   memo in Section 3.2 allows the receiver to start the decoding order
   recovery before the reception of a RTCP sender report if the RTP
   header extension is earlier provided in the RTP flow.  Using the RTP
   header extensions may be the only way to allow correct decoding order
   recovery based on exact matching of NTP timestamps in the presence of
   clock skew in the clock used for generating the NTP wallclock.

   Furthermore, some use cases may allow to use synchronously inserted
   RTP header extensions containing NTP timestamps to align the RTP
   timestamps of the multiple RTP flows, i.e. use cases where the RTP
   timestamps of the multiple RTP flows are generated from the same
   clock source.  In such use cases, starting from a synchronous
   insertion of the RTP header extensions, the application may use the
   detected difference of RTP random offset values in the multiple
   sessions to align the media samples of parts of samples.

   Since typically for layered video codecs as, e.g.  SVC [7], the
   decoding order is not equal to the presentation order of the media
   samples, media samples or parts of media samples cannot be simply
   ordered according to the presentation timestamp order.  For this
   reason, if transporting media samples or parts of media samples of a



Perkins & Schierl       Expires November 8, 2009               [Page 14]

   layered, multi-view or multi description codec in different RTP
   flows, the following rules SHOULD be kept for sending such flows:

   Note: The following rules are typically kept for layered audio
   codecs, which allows using the same algorithm for decoding order
   recovery of audio samples.

   Terminology: Following the decoding order of RTP flows as described
   above, an RTP flow containing sample data which is required to be
   accessed and/or decoded before decoding a second sample data of
   another RTP flow is called a lower RTP flow with respect to the
   second RTP flow.  A second RTP flow, which requires for the decoding
   process accessing and/or decoding the sample data of the lower RTP
   flow is called the higher RTP flow.  The lowest RTP flow is the flow,
   which does not require the presence of any other data.

   o  The decoding order of media samples or part of the media samples
      transported in different RTP flows SHOULD be derivable by any
      means.  This can be accomplished, e.g. by using the mechanisms
      defined in [6] if the sample data or parts of the sample data are
      transported in different RTP sessions or by any other means.

   o  For each two RTP flows the following rules SHOULD be true in order
      to allow decoding order recovery based on matching NTP timestamps
      present in the different RTP flows:

      1.  The order of the RTP samples within an RTP flow is equal to
          the decoding order.

      2.  A higher RTP flow contains all the same sampling instances of
          the lower RTP flow.  A higher RTP flow may contain additional
          sampling instances.

   Note: In some cases, it may be required to add packets in higher RTP
   flows in order to satisfy the second rule above.  This may be
   achieved by placing empty RTP packets (containing padding data only)
   or by other payload means as, e.g. the Empty NAL unit packet as
   defined in [7].

   If a packet must be inserted for satisfying the above rule, the NTP
   timestamp of such an inserted packet MUST be set equal to the NTP
   timestamp of a packet of the same sample present in any lower RTP
   flow and the lowest RTP flow.  This is easy to accomplish if the
   packet can be inserted at the time of the RTP flow generation, since
   the NTP timestamp must be the same for the inserted packet and the
   packet of the corresponding sample.

   The above rules allow the receiver to process the data of the RTP



Perkins & Schierl       Expires November 8, 2009               [Page 15]

   flows as follows:

   o  Go through all received RTP flows starting with the highest RTP
      flow and aggregate the sample data or parts of the sample data
      with the same NTP timestamp in the order of RTP flows, starting
      from the lowest RTP flow up to the highest RTP flow received, to
      the sample with the NTP timestamp present in the highest RTP flow.
      The NTP timestamps MAY be derived using RTCP sender reports or MAY
      be directly taken from the NTP timestamp provided in an RTP header
      extension.  The order of RTP flows may e.g. be indicated by
      mechanisms as defined in [6] or any other implicit or explicit
      means.  Repeat the aforementioned process for each different NTP
      timestamp present in the highest RTP flow.

   Informative example: The example shown in Figure 3 refers to three
   RTP flows A, B and C containing a layered, a multi-view or a multi-
   description media stream.  In the example, the dependency signalling
   as defined in [6] indicates that flow A is the lowest RTP flow, B is
   the first higher RTP flow and depends on A, and C is the second
   higher RTP flow corresponding to flow A and depends on A and B. A
   media coding structure is used that results in samples present in
   higher flows but not present in all lower flows.  Flow A has the
   lowest frame rate and Flow B and C have the same but higher frame
   rate.  The figure shows the full video samples with their
   corresponding RTP timestamps "(x)".  The video samples are already
   re-ordered according to their RTP sequence number order.  The figure
   indicates for the received sample in decoding order within each RTP
   flow, as well as the associated NTP media timestamps ("TS[..]").
   These timestamps may be derived using the NTP format wallclock
   provided in the RTCP sender reports or as shown in the figure
   directly from the NTP timestamp contained in the RTP header
   extensions as indicate by the timestamp in "<x>".  Note that the
   timestamps are not in increasing order since, in this example, the
   decoding order is different from the output/presentation order.

   The process first proceeds to the sample parts associated with the
   first available synchronous insertion of NTP timestamp into RTP
   header extensions at NTP media timestamp TS=[8] and starts in the
   highest RTP flow C and removes/ignores all preceding sample parts (in
   decoding order) to sample parts with TS=[8] in each of the de-
   jittering buffers of RTP flows A, B, and C. Then, starting from flow
   C, the first media timestamp available in decoding order (TS=[8]) is
   selected and sample parts starting from RTP flow A, and flow B and C
   are placed in order of the RTP flow dependency as indicated by
   mechanisms defined in [6] (in the example for TS[8]: first flow B and
   then flow C into the video sample VS(TS[8]) associated with NTP media
   timestamp TS=[8].  Then the next media timestamp TS=[6] (RTP
   timestamp=(4)) in order of appearance in the highest RTP flow C is

   processed and the process described above is repeated.  Note that
   there may be video samples with no sample parts present, e.g., in the
   lowest RTP flow A (see, e.g., TS=[5]).  The decoding order recovery
   process could be also started after receiving all RTP sender reports
   "RTP"-"wallclock" mapping (indicated as timestamps "(x){y}") assuming
   that there is no clock skew in the source used for the wallclock
   generation.
