    Dual-Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion
                 draft-ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite-04

Abstract

   This document revisits the dual-stack model and introduces the dual-
   stack lite technology aimed at better aligning the costs and benefits
   of deploying IPv6.  Dual-stack lite enables a broadband service
   provider to share IPv4 addresses among customers by combining two
   well-known technologies: IP in IP (IPv4-in-IPv6) and Network Address
   Translation (NAT).

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                  March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The common thinking for more than 10 years has been that the
   transition to IPv6 will be based on the dual stack model and that
   most things would be converted this way before we ran out of IPv4.

   However, this has not happened.  The IANA free pool of IPv4 addresses
   will be depleted soon, well before any significant IPv6 deployment
   will have occurred.

   This document revisits the dual-stack model and introduces the dual-
   stack lite technology aimed at better aligning the costs and benefits
   of deploying IPv6.  Dual-stack lite will provide the necessary bridge
   between the two protocols, offering an evolution path of the Internet
   post IANA IPv4 depletion.

   Dual-stack lite enables a broadband service provider to share IPv4
   addresses among customers by combining two well-known technologies:
   IP in IP (IPv4-in-IPv6) and NAT.

   This document makes a distinction between a dual-stack capable and a
   dual-stack provisioned device.  The former is a device that has code
   that implements both IPv4 and IPv6, from the network layer to the
   applications.  The latter is a similar device that has been
   provisioned with both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address on its
   interface(s).  This document will also further refine this notion by
   distinguishing between interfaces provisioned directly by the service
   provider from those provisioned by the customer.

   Pure IPv6-only devices (i.e. devices that do not include an IPv4
   stack) are outside of the scope of this document.


2.  Requirements language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   The technology described in this document is known as dual-stack
   lite.  The abbreviation DS-Lite will be used along this text.

   This document also introduces two new terms: the DS-Lite Basic
   Bridging BroadBand element (B4) and the DS-Lite Address Family
   Transition Router element (AFTR).

4.  Deployment scenarios

4.1.  Access model

   Instead of relying on a cascade of NATs, the dual-stack lite model is
   built on IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnels to cross the network to reach a
   carrier-grade IPv4-IPv4 NAT (the AFTR) where customers will share
   IPv4 addresses.  There are numbers of benefits to this approach:

   o  This technology decouples the deployment of IPv6 in the service
      provider network (up to the customer premise equipment or CPE)
      from the deployment of IPv6 in the global Internet and in customer
      applications & devices.

   o  The management of the service provider access networks is
      simplified by leveraging the large IPv6 address space.
      Overlapping private IPv4 address spaces are not required to
      support very large customer bases.

   o  As tunnels can terminate anywhere in the service provider network,
      this architecture leads itself to horizontal scaling and provides
      great flexibility to adapt to changing traffic load.

   o  Tunnels provide a direct connection between B4 and the AFTR.  This
      can be leveraged to enable customers and their applications to
      control how the NAT function of the AFTR is performed.

   A key characteristic of this approach is that communications between
   end-nodes stay within their address family.  IPv6 sources only
   communicate with IPv6 destinations, IPv4 sources only communicate
   with IPv4 destinations.  There is no protocol family translation
   involved in this approach.  This simplifies greatly the task of
   applications that may carry literal IP addresses in their payload.

4.2.  Home gateway

   This section describes home Local Area networks characterized by the
   presence of a home gateway provisioned only with IPv6 by the service
   provider.

   A DS-Lite home gateway is an IPv6 aware home gateway with a B4
   Interface implemented in the WAN interface.

   A DS-Lite home gateway SHOULD NOT operate a NAT function on a B4
   interface, as the NAT function will be performed by the AFTR in the
   service provider's network.  That will avoid accidentally operating
   in a double NAT environment.

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                  March 2010


   However, it SHOULD operate its own DHCP(v4) server handing out
   [RFC1918] address space (e.g. 192.168.0.0/16) to hosts in the home.
   It SHOULD advertise itself as the default IPv4 router to those home
   hosts.  It SHOULD also advertise itself as a DNS server in the DHCP
   Option 6 (DNS Server).  Additionally, it SHOULD operate a DNS proxy
   to accept DNS IPv4 requests from home hosts and send them using IPv6
   to the service provider DNS servers, as described in Section 5.5.

   Note: if an IPv4 home host decides to use another IPv4 DNS server,
   the DS-Lite home gateway will forward those DNS requests via the B4
   interface, the same way it forwards any regular IPv4 packets.

   IPv6 capable devices directly reach the IPv6 Internet.  Packets
   simply follow IPv6 routing, they do not go through the tunnel, and
   are not subject to any translation.  It is expected that most IPv6
   capable devices will also be IPv4 capable and will simply be
   configured with an IPv4 RFC1918 style address within the home network
   and access the IPv4 Internet the same way as the legacy IPv4-only
   devices within the home.

   Pure IPv6-only devices (i.e. devices that do not include an IPv4
   stack) are outside of the scope of this document.

4.3.  Directly connected device

   In broadband home networks, sometime devices are directly connected
   to the broadband service provider.  They are connected straight to a
   modem, without a home gateway.

   Under this scenario, the customer device is a dual-stack capable host
   that is only provisioned by the service provider only with IPv6.  The
   device itself acts as a B4 element and the IPv4 service is provided
   by an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel, just as in the home gateway case.  That
   device can run any combinations of IPv4 and/or IPv6 applications.

   A directly connected DS-Lite device SHOULD send its DNS requests over
   IPv6 to the IPv6 DNS server it has been configured to use.

   Similarly to the previous sections, IPv6 packets follow IPv6 routing,
   they do not go through the tunnel, and are not subject to any
   translation.

   The support of IPv4-only devices and IPv6-only devices in this
   scenario is out of scope for this document.

5.  B4 element

5.1.  Definition

   The B4 element is a function implemented on a dual-stack capable
   node, either a directly connected device or a home gateway, that
   creates a tunnel to an AFTR.

5.2.  Encapsulation

   The tunnel is a multi-point to point IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel ending on a
   service provider AFTR.

   See section 7.1 for additional tunneling considerations.

   Note: at this point, DS-Lite only defines IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnels,
   however other types of encapsulation could be defined in the future.

5.3.  Fragmentation and Reassembly

   Using an encapsulation (IPv4-in-IPv6 or anything else) to carry IPv4
   traffic over IPv6 will reduce the effective MTU of the datagram.
   Unfortunately, path MTU discovery [RFC1191] is not a reliable method
   to deal with this problem.

   A solution to deal with this problem is for the service provider to
   increase the MTU size of all the links between the B4 element and the
   AFTR elements by at least 40 bytes to accommodate both the IPv6
   encapsulation header and the IPv4 datagram without fragmenting the
   IPv6 packet.

   However, as not all service providers will be able to increase their
   link MTU, the B4 element MUST perform fragmentation and reassembly if
   the outgoing link MTU cannot accommodate for the extra IPv6 header.
   Fragmentation MUST happen after the encapsulation on the IPv6 packet.
   Reassembly MUST happen before the decapsulation of the IPv6 header.
   Detailed procedure has been specified in [RFC2473] Section 7.2.

5.4.  AFTR discovery

   In order to configure the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel, the B4 element needs
   the IPv6 address of the AFTR element.  This IPv6 address can be
   configured using a variety of methods, ranging from an out-of-band
   mechanism, manual configuration or a variety of DHCPv6 options.

   In order to guarantee interoperability, a B4 element SHOULD implement
   the DHCPv6 option defined in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option].

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                  March 2010


5.5.  DNS

   A B4 element is only configured from the service provider with IPv6.
   As such, it can only learn the address of a DNS recursive server
   through DHCPv6 (or other similar method over IPv6).  As DHCPv6 only
   defines an option to get the IPv6 address of such a DNS recursive
   server, the B4 element cannot easily discover the IPv4 address of
   such a recursive DNS server, and as such will have to perform all DNS
   resolution over IPv6.

   The B4 element can pass this IPv6 address to downstream IPv6 nodes,
   but not to downstream IPv4 nodes.  As such, the B4 element SHOULD
   implement a DNS proxy, following the recommendations of [RFC5625].

5.6.  Interface initialization

   Initialization of the interface including a B4 element is out-of-
   scope in this specification.

5.7.  Well-known IPv4 address

   Any locally unique IPv4 address could be configured on the IPv4-in-
   IPv6 tunnel to represent the B4 element.  Configuring such an address
   is often necessary when the B4 element is sourcing IPv4 datagrams
   directly over the tunnel.  In order to avoid conflicts with any other
   address, IANA has defined a well-known range, 192.0.0.0/29.

   192.0.0.0 is the reserved subnet address. 192.0.0.1 is reserved for
   the AFTR element.  The B4 element MAY use any other addresses within
   the 192.0.0.0/29 range.

   Note: a range of addresses has been reserved for this purpose.  The
   intent is to accommodate nodes implementing multiple B4 elements.


6.  AFTR element

6.1.  Definition

   An AFTR element is the combination of an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel end-
   point and an IPv4-IPv4 NAT implemented on the same node.

6.2.  Encapsulation

   The tunnel is a point-to-multipoint IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel ending at the
   B4 elements.

   See section 7.1 for additional tunneling considerations.

   Note: at this point, DS-Lite only defines IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnels,
   however other types of encapsulation could be defined in the future.

6.3.  Fragmentation and Reassembly

   As noted previously, fragmentation and reassembly need to be taken
   care of by the tunnel end-points.  As such, the AFTR MUST perform
   fragmentation and reassembly if the underlying link MTU cannot
   accommodate the extra IPv6 header of the tunnel.  Fragmentation MUST
   happen after the encapsulation on the IPv6 packet.  Reassembly MUST
   happen before the decapsulation of the IPv6 header.  Detailed
   procedure has been specified in [RFC2473] Section 7.2.

   Fragmentation at the Tunnel Entry-Point is a light-weight operation.
   In contrast, reassembly at the Tunnel Exit-Point can be expensive.
   When the Tunnel Exit-Point receives the first fragmented packet, it
   must wait for the second fragmented packet to arrive in order to
   reassemble the two fragmented IPv6 packets for decapsulation.  This
   requires the Tunnel Exit-Point to buffer and keep track of fragmented
   packets.  Consider that the AFTR is the Tunnel Exit-Point for many
   tunnels.  If many clients simultaneously source large number of
   fragmented packets to the AFTR, this will require the AFTR to buffer
   and consume enormous resources to keep track of the flows.  This
   reassembly process will significantly impact the AFTR performance.
   However, this impact only happens when many clients simultaneously
   source large IPv4 packets.  Since we believe that majority of the
   clients will receive large IPv4 packets (such as watching video
   streams) instead of sourcing large IPv4 packets (such as sourcing
   video streams), so reassembly is only a fraction of the overall
   AFTR's workload.

   Methods to avoid fragmentation, such as rewriting the TCP MSS option
   or using technologies such as Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation
   Layer defined in [I-D.templin-seal] are out of scope for this
   document.

6.4.  DNS

   As noted previously, DS-Lite node implementing a B4 elements will
   perform DNS resolution over IPv6.  As such, very few, if any, DNS
   packets will flow through the AFTR element.

6.5.  Well-known IPv4 address

   The AFTR MAY use the well-known IPv4 address 192.0.0.1 reserved by
   IANA to configure the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.  That address can then be
   used to report ICMP problems and will appear in traceroute outputs.

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                  March 2010


6.6.  Extended binding table

   The NAT binding table of the AFTR element is extended to include the
   source IPv6 address of the incoming packets.  This IPv6 address is
   used to disambiguate between the overlapping IPv4 address space of
   the service provider customers.

   By doing a reverse look-up in the extended IPv4 NAT binding table,
   the AFTR knows how to reconstruct the IPv6 encapsulation when the
   packets comes back from the Internet.  That way, there is no need to
   keep a static configuration for each tunnel.


7.  Network Considerations

7.1.  Tunneling

   Tunneling MUST be done in accordance to [RFC2473] and [RFC4213].
   Traffic classes ([RFC2474]) from the IPv4 headers SHOULD be carried
   over to the IPv6 headers and vice versa.

7.2.  VPN

   Dual-stack lite implementations SHOULD not interfere with the
   functioning of IPv4 or IPv6 VPNs.

7.3.  Multicast considerations

   Multicast is out-of-scope in this document.


8.  NAT considerations

8.1.  NAT pool

   AFTRs MAY operate distinct, non overlapping NAT pools.  Those NAT
   pools do not have to be continuous.

8.2.  NAT conformance

   A dual-stack lite AFTR SHOULD implement behavior conforming to the
   best current practice, currently documented in [RFC4787], [RFC5382]
   and [RFC5508].  Other requirements for AFTRs can be found in

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                  March 2010


8.3.  Application Level Gateways (ALG)

   The AFTR should only perform a minimum number of ALG for the classic
   applications such as FTP, RTSP/RTP, IPsec and PPTP VPN pass-through
   and enable the users to use their own ALG on statically or
   dynamically reserved ports instead.

8.4.  Port allocation

8.4.1.  How many ports per customers?

   Because IPv4 addresses will be shared among customers and potentially
   a large address space reduction factor may be applied, in average,
   only a limited number N of TCP or UDP port numbers will be available
   per customer.  This means that applications opening a very large
   number of TCP ports may have a harder time to work.  For example, it
   has been reported that a very well know web site was using AJAX
   techniques and was opening up to 69 TCP ports per web page.  If we
   make the hypothesis of an address space reduction of a factor 100
   (one IPv4 address per 100 customers), and 65k ports per IPv4
   addresses available, that makes an average of N = 650 ports available
   simultaneously to be shared among the various devices behind the
   dual-stack lite tunnel end-point.

   There is an important operational difference if those N ports are
   pre-allocated in a cookie-cutter fashion versus allocated on demand
   by incoming connections.  This is a difference between an average of
   N ports and a maximum of N ports.  Several service providers have
   reported an average number of connections per customer in the single
   digits.  At the opposite end, thousands or tens of thousands of ports
   could be use in a peak by any single customer browsing a number of
   AJAX/Web 2.0 sites.

   As such, service providers allocating a fixed number of ports per
   user should dimension the system with a minimum of N = several
   thousands of ports for every user.  This would bring the address
   space reduction ratio to a single digit.  Service providers using a
   smaller number of ports per user (N in the hundreds) should expect
   customers applications to break in a more or less random way over
   time.

   In order to achieve higher address space reduction ratios, it is
   recommended that service provider do not use this cookie-cutter
   approach, and, on the contrary, allocate ports as dynamically as
   possible, just like on a regular NAT.  With an average number of
   connections per customers in the single digit, having an address
   space reduction of a factor 100 is realistic.  However, service
   providers should exercise caution and make sure their pool of port

   numbers does not go too low.  The actual maximum address space
   reduction factor is unknown at this time.

8.4.2.  Dynamic port assignment considerations

   When dynamic port assignment is used to maximize the number of
   subscribers sharing the AFTR global IPv4 addresses, the AFTR should
   implement checks to avoid DOS attack through exhaustion of available
   ports.  It should also avoid mapping any one subscriber's "flows"
   across more than one global IPv4 address.

8.4.3.  Subscriber controlled port assignment

   Dynamic port assignment precludes inbound access to subscriber
   servers, just as in a home gateway NAT.  Inbound access to subscriber
   servers can be provided through pre-assigned and/or reserved port
   mappings in the AFTR.  Specifying the mechanisms for managing and
   signaling these reserved port mappings is out of scope for this
   document, however some techniques are mentioned in appendix A as
   examples.

8.5.  Other considerations about sharing global IPv4 addresses

   More considerations on sharing the port space of IPv4 addresses can
   be found in [I-D.ford-shared-addressing-issues].

10.  IANA Considerations

   This draft request IANA to allocate a well know IPv4 192.0.0.0/29
   network prefix.  That range is used to number the dual-stack lite
   interfaces.  Reserving a /29 allows for 6 possible interfaces on a
   multi-home node.  The IPv4 address 192.0.0.1 is reserved as the IPv4

   address of the default router for such dual-stack lite hosts.


11.  Security Considerations

   Security issues associated with NAT have long been documented.  See
   [RFC2663] and [RFC2993].

   However, moving the NAT functionality from the home gateway to the
   core of the service provider network and sharing IPv4 addresses among
   customers create additional requirements when logging data for abuse
   usage.  With any architecture where an IPv4 address does not uniquely
   represent an end host, IPv4 addresses and a timestamps are no longer
   sufficient to identify a particular broadband customer.  Additional
   information such as transport protocol information will be required
   for that purpose.  For example, we suggest to log the transport port
   number for TCP and UDP connections.

   The AFTR performs translation functions for interior IPv4 hosts at
   RFC 1918 addresses or at the IANA reserved address range (TBA by
   IANA).  If the interior host is properly using the authorized IPv4
   address with the authorized transport protocol port range such as A+P
   semantic for the tunnel, the AFTR can simply forward without
   translation to permit the authorized address and port range to
   function properly.  All packets with unauthorized interior IPv4
   addresses or with authorized interior IPv4 address but unauthorized
   port range MUST NOT be forwarded by the AFTR.  This prevents rogue
   devices from launching denial of service attacks using unauthorized
   public IPv4 addresses in the IPv4 source header field or unauthorized
   transport port range in the IPv4 transport header field.  For
   example, rogue devices could bombard a public web server by launching
   TCP SYN ACK attack.  The victim will receive TCP SYN from random IPv4
   source addresses at a rapid rate and deny TCP services to legitimate
   users.

   With IPv4 addresses shared by multiple users, ports become a critical
   resource.  As such, some mechanisms need to be put in place by an
   AFTR to limit port usage, either by rate-limiting new connections or
   putting a hard limit on the maximum number of port usable by single
   user.  If this number is high enough, it should not interfere with
   normal usage and still provide reasonable protection of the shared
   pool.  More considerations on ports allocation and port exhaustion
   can be found in section 8.4.

   More considerations on sharing IPv4 addresses can be found in
   "I-D.ford-shared-addressing-issues".

   AFTRs should support ways to limit service to registered customers.

   If strict IPv6 ingress filtering is deployed in the broadband network
   to prevent IPv6 address spoofing and dual-stack lite service is
   restricted to those customers, then tunnels terminating at the AFTR
   and coming from registered customer IPv6 addresses cannot be spoofed.
   Thus a simple access control list on the tunnel transport source
   address is all that is required to accept traffic on the southbound
   interface of an AFTR.

   If IPv6 address spoofing prevention is not in place, the AFTR should
   perform further sanity checks on the IPv6 address of incoming IPv6
   packets.  For example, it should check if the address has really been
   allocated to an authorized customer.

13.  Appendix A: future DS-Lite extensions

   Techniques discussed below are not part of the core dual-stack lite
   specification and will be developed in separate documents.  They are
   only listed here as examples.

   Applications expecting incoming connections, such a peer-to-peer
   applications, have become popular.  Those applications use a very
   limited number of ports, usually a single one.  Making sure those
   applications keep working in a dual-stack lite environment is
   important.  Similarly, there is a growing list of applications that
   require some kind of ALG to work through a NAT.  Service provider
   AFTRs should not prevent the deployment of such applications.  As
   such, there is a legitimate need to leave certain ports under the
   control of the end user.  This argues for a hybrid environment, where
   most ports are dynamically managed by the AFTR in a shared pool and a
   limited number are dedicated per users and controlled by them.

13.1.  Static port reservation

   A service provider can reserve a number of static ports per user.
   Note: those could be TCP and/or UDP ports.  The simplest model to
   allow users to control the associated NAT bindings is to offer a web



Durand                  Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                  March 2010


   interface (for example as part of the service provider portal) where,
   once authenticated, a user can configure each dedicated external IPv4
   address/port binding on the AFTR either using the port forwarding
   semantic or the A+P semantic.

   Note: The exact number of ports reserved per user is left at the
   discretion of the service provider.

13.1.1.  Port forwarding model

   In this model, the subscriber directs the AFTR to rewrite the
   destination address in those incoming packets to a private IPv4
   address within the home network.  For obvious security reasons,
   redirection to global IPv4 address should not be authorized.  Note:
   this behavior is very similar to the port forwarding function found
   in most home gateways.

13.1.2.  A+P model

   The subscriber directs the AFTR to forward incoming traffic on a
   given address/port to the dual-stack lite home gateway, and let this
   device deal with it.  This required support for A+P [I-D.ymbk-aplusp]
   semantic on both the AFTR and on the home gateway.

   In particular, an A+P aware home router can locally NAT A+P packets
   to and from internal hosts.  Alternatively, it can forward directly
   the traffic to those hosts if they are configured, for example, with
   A+P secondary address and ports.

   An AFTR forwards packets in the A+P range directly to and from the
   tunnels without NAT.

13.2.  Dynamic port reservation

13.2.1.  UPnP

   A B4 element can act as a UPnP relay, forwarding UPnP messages over
   the tunnel to the AFTR.  This may work in some cases, but not all the
   time.  Some applications insist on running on a well-known port
   number (or port range) using UPnP to request the NAT to reserve that
   port.  Those ports may or may not be available; they could be used by
   another customer.  Using UPnP, a NAT box does not have any way to
   redirect such applications to use another port, the only option is to
   deny the request.  Those applications typically then cycle through a
   small range of ports (typically 10 or so) until they abort.  The
   likelihood of those ports being all already in use by other users is
   an inverse function of the address space reduction, ie, how many
   users are sharing the same address.

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                  March 2010


   Note: the UPnP forum has been reported to address this issue in an
   upcoming version of the IGD profile.

13.2.2.  NAT-PMP

   NAT-PMP [I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp] offers a better semantic, by enabling
   the NAT to redirect the application to use another unallocated port.
   A B4 element could proxy the NAT-PMP messages to the AFTR through the
   tunnel.

13.2.3.  DHCPv6

   If more ports need to be reserved outside of that static dedicated
   range, a DHCPv6 option such as
   [I-D.bajko-v6ops-port-restricted-ipaddr-assign] may also be an
   interesting approach.  This may be limited to the A+P semantic
   mentioned above, as there might not be a way to explicitly control
   the port forwarding semantic.  Also, there are concerns that this
   would lead to a cookie cutter distribution of ports per customers,
   dramatically reducing the ratio of customer per IPv4 address.


14.  Appendix B: Examples

14.1.  Gateway based architecture

   This architecture is targeted at residential broadband deployments
   but can be adapted easily to other types of deployment where the
   installed base of IPv4-only devices is important.

   Consider a scenario where a Dual-Stack lite home gateway is
   provisioned only with IPv6 in the WAN port, no IPv4.  The home
   gateway acts as an IPv4 DCHP server for the LAN network (wireline and
   wireless) handing out RFC1918 addresses.  In addition, the home
   gateway may support IPv6 Auto-Configuration and/or DHCPv6 server for
   the LAN network.  When an IPv4-only device connects to the home
   gateway, the gateway will hand it out a RFC1918 address.  When a
   dual-stack capable device connects to the home gateway, the gateway
   will hand out a RFC1918 address and a global IPv6 address to the
   device.  Besides, the home gateway will create an IPv4-in-IPv6
   softwire tunnel [RFC5571]to an AFTR that resides in the service
   provider network.

   When the device accesses IPv6 service, it will send the IPv6 datagram
   to the home gateway natively.  The home gateway will route the
   traffic upstream to the default gateway.

   When the device accesses IPv4 service, it will source the IPv4

   datagram with the RFC1918 address and send the IPv4 datagram to the
   home gateway.  The home gateway will encapsulate the IPv4 datagram
   inside the IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire tunnel and forward the IPv6 datagram
   to the AFTR.  This contrasts what the home gateways normally do today
   which will NAT the RFC1918 address to the public IPv4 address and
   route the datagram upstream.  When the AFTR receives the IPv6
   datagram, it will decapsulate the IPv6 header and perform an IPv4-to-
   IPv4 NAT on the source address.

   As illustrated in Figure 1, this dual-stack lite deployment model
   consists of three components: the dual-stack lite home router with a
   B4 element, the AFTR and a softwire between the B4 element acting as
   softwire initiator (SI) [RFC5571] in the dual-stack lite home router
   and the softwire concentrator (SC) [RFC5571] in the AFTR.  The AFTR
   performs IPv4-IPv4 NAT translations to multiplex multiple subscribers
   through a pool of global IPv4 address.  Overlapping address spaces
   used by subscribers are disambiguated through the identification of
   tunnel endpoints.

   Notes:

   o  The dual-stack lite home router is not required to be on the same
      link as the host

   o  The dual-stack lite home router could be replaced by a dual-stack
      lite router in the service provider network

   The resulting solution accepts an IPv4 datagram that is translated
   into an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire datagram for transmission across the
   softwire.  At the corresponding endpoint, the IPv4 datagram is
   decapsulated, and the translated IPv4 address is inserted based on a
   translation from the softwire.

14.1.1.  Example message flow

   In the example shown in Figure 2, the translation tables in the AFTR
   is configured to forward between IP/TCP (10.0.0.1/10000) and IP/TCP
   (129.0.0.1/5000).  That is, a datagram received by the dual-stack
   lite home router from the host at address 10.0.0.1, using TCP DST
   port 10000 will be translated a datagram with IP SRC address
   129.0.0.1 and TCP SRC port 5000 in the Internet.

                         Datagram header contents

   When datagram 1 is received by the dual-stack lite home router, the
   B4 function encapsulates the datagram in datagram 2 and forwards it
   to the dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT over the softwire.

   When it receives datagram 2, the tunnel concentrator in the AFTR
   hands the IPv4 datagram to the NAT, which determines from its
   translation table that the datagram received on Softwire_1 with TCP
   SRC port 10000 should be translated to datagram 3 with IP SRC address
   129.0.0.1 and TCP SRC port 5000.

   Figure 3 shows an inbound message received at the AFTR.  When the NAT
   function in the AFTR receives datagram 1, it looks up the IP/TCP DST
   in its translation table.  In the example in Figure 3, the NAT
   translates the TCP DST port to 10000, sets the IP DST address to
   10.0.0.1 and hands the datagram to the SC for transmission over
   Softwire_1.  The B4 in the home router decapsulates IPv4 datagram
   from the inbound softwire datagram, and forwards it to the host.

                         Datagram header contents

14.1.2.  Translation details

   The AFTR has a NAT that translates between softwire/port pairs and
   IPv4-address/port pairs.  The same translation is applied to IPv4
   datagrams received on the device's external interface and from the
   softwire endpoint in the device.

   In Figure 2, the translator network interface in the AFTR is on the
   Internet, and the softwire interface connects to the dual-stack lite
   home router.  The AFTR translator is configured as follows:

   Network interface:  Translate IPv4 destination address and TCP
      destination port to the softwire identifier and TCP destination
      port

   Softwire interface:  Translate softwire identifier and TCP source
      port to IPv4 source address and TCP source port

   Here is how the translation in Figure 3 works:

   o  Datagram 1 is received on the AFTR translator network interface.
      The translator looks up the IPv4-address/port pair in its
      translator table, rewrites the IPv4 destination address to
      10.0.0.1 and the TCP source port to 10000, and hands the datagram
      to the SE to be forwarded over the softwire.

   o  The IPv4 datagram is received on the dual-stack lite home router
      B4.  The B4 function extracts the IPv4 datagram and the dual-stack
      lite home router forwards datagram 3 to the host.

         +----------------------------------+--------------------+
         |       Softwire-Id/IPv4/Prot/Port | IPv4/Prot/Port     |
         +----------------------------------+--------------------+

         +----------------------------------+--------------------+

            Dual-Stack lite carrier-grade NAT translation table

   The Softwire-Id is the IPv6 address assigned to the Dual-Stack lite
   home gateway.  Hosts behind the same Dual-Stack lite home router have
   the same Softwire-Id.  The source IPv4 is the RFC1918 addressed
   assigned by the Dual-Stack home router which is unique to each host
   behind the home gateway.  The AFTR would receive packets sourced from
   different IPv4 addresses in the same softwire tunnel.  The AFTR
   combines the Softwire-Id and IPv4 address/Port [Softwire-Id, IPv4+
   Port] to uniquely identify the host behind the same Dual-Stack lite
   home router.

14.2.  Host based architecture

   This architecture is targeted at new, large scale deployments of
   dual-stack capable devices implementing a dual-stack lite interface.

   Consider a scenario where a Dual-Stack lite host device is directly
   connected to the service provider network.  The host device is dual-
   stack capable but only provisioned an IPv6 global address.  Besides,
   the host device will pre-configure a well-known IPv4 non-routable
   address (see IANA section).  This well-known IPv4 non-routable
   address is similar to the 127.0.0.1 loopback address.  Every host
   device implemented Dual-Stack lite will pre-configure the same
   address.  This address will be used to source the IPv4 datagram when
   the device accesses IPv4 services.  Besides, the host device will
   create an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire tunnel to an AFTR.  The Carrier Grade
   NAT will reside in the service provider network.

   When the device accesses IPv6 service, the device will send the IPv6
   datagram natively to the default gateway.

   When the device accesses IPv4 service, it will source the IPv4
   datagram with the well-known non-routable IPv4 address.  Then, the
   host device will encapsulate the IPv4 datagram inside the IPv4-in-
   IPv6 softwire tunnel and send the IPv6 datagram to the AFTR.  When
   the AFTR receives the IPv6 datagram, it will decapsulate the IPv6
   header and perform IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT on the source address.

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                  March 2010


   This scenario works on both wireline and wireless networks.  A
   typical wireless device will connect directly to the service provider
   without home gateway in between.

   As illustrated in Figure 4, this dual-stack lite deployment model
   consists of three components: the dual-stack lite host, the AFTR and
   a softwire between the softwire initiator B4 in the host and the
   softwire concentrator in the AFTR.  The dual-stack lite host is
   assumed to have IPv6 service and can exchange IPv6 traffic with the
   AFTR.

   The AFTR performs IPv4-IPv4 NAT translations to multiplex multiple
   subscribers through a pool of global IPv4 address.  Overlapping IPv4
   address spaces used by the dual-stack lite hosts are disambiguated
   through the identification of tunnel endpoints.

   In this situation, the dual-stack lite host configures the IPv4
   address 192.0.0.2 out of the well-known range 192.0.0.0/29 (defined
   by IANA) on its B4 interface.  It also configure the first non-
   reserved IPv4 address of the reserved range, 192.0.0.1 as the address
   of its default gateway.

   The resulting solution accepts an IPv4 datagram that is translated
   into an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire datagram for transmission across the
   softwire.  At the corresponding endpoint, the IPv4 datagram is
   decapsulated, and the translated IPv4 address is inserted based on a
   translation from the softwire.

                         Datagram header contents

   When sending an IPv4 packet, the dual-stack lite host encapsulates it
   in datagram 1 and forwards it to the AFTR over the softwire.

   When it receives datagram 1, the concentrator in the AFTR hands the
   IPv4 datagram to the NAT, which determines from its translation table
   that the datagram received on Softwire_1 with TCP SRC port 10000
   should be translated to datagram 3 with IP SRC address 129.0.0.1 and
   TCP SRC port 5000.

   Figure 6 shows an inbound message received at the AFTR.  When the NAT
   function in the AFTR receives datagram 1, it looks up the IP/TCP DST
   in its translation table.  In the example in Figure 3, the NAT
   translates the TCP DST port to 10000, sets the IP DST address to
   a.b.c.d and hands the datagram to the concentrator for transmission
   over Softwire_1.  The B4 in the dual-stack lite hosts decapsulates
   IPv4 datagram from the inbound softwire datagram, and forwards it to
   the host.

14.2.2.  Translation details

   The translations happening in the AFTR are the same as in the
   previous examples.  The well known IPv4 address 192.0.0.2 out of the
   192.0.0.0/29 (defined by IANA) range used by all the hosts are
   disambiguated by the IPv6 source address of the softwire.

         +---------------------------------+--------------------+
         |      Softwire-Id/IPv4/Prot/Port | IPv4/Prot/Port     |
         +---------------------------------+--------------------+
         | 2001:0:0:1::1/a.b.c.d/TCP/10000 | 129.0.0.1/TCP/5000 |
         +---------------------------------+--------------------+

            Dual-Stack lite carrier-grade NAT translation table

   The Softwire-Id is the IPv6 address assigned to the Dual-Stack host.
   Each host has an unique Softwire-Id.  The source IPv4 address is one
   of the well-known IPv4 address.  The AFTR could receive packets from
   different hosts sourced from the same IPv4 well-known address from
   different softwire tunnels.  Similar to the gateway architecture, the
   AFTR combines the Softwire-Id and IPv4 address/Port [Softwire-Id,
   IPv4+Port] to uniquely identify the individual host.


15.  Appendix C: Deployment considerations

15.1.  AFTR service distribution and horizontal scaling

   One of the key benefits of the dual-stack lite technology lies in the
   fact it is tunnel based.  That is, tunnel end-points may be anywhere



Durand                  Expires September 9, 2010              [Page 32]

   in the service provider network.

   Using the DHCPv6 tunnel end-point option, service providers can
   create groups of users sharing the same AFTR.  Those groups can be
   merged or divided at will.  This leads to an horizontally scaled
   solution, where more capacity is added simply by adding more boxes.
   As those groups of users can evolve over time, it is best to make
   sure that AFTRs do not require per-user configuration in order to
   provide service.

15.2.  Horizontal scaling

   A service provider can start using just a few AFTR centrally located.
   Later, when more capacity is needed, more boxes can be added and
   pushed to the edges of the access network.  In case of a spike of
   traffic, for example during the Olympic games or an important
   political event, capacity can be quickly added in any location of the
   network (tunnels can terminate anywhere) simply by splitting user
   groups.  Extra capacity can be later removed when the traffic returns
   to normal by resetting the DHCPv6 tunnel end-point settings.

15.3.  High availability

   An important element in the design of the dual-stack lite technology
   is the simplicity of implementation on the customer side.  A simple
   IP4-in-IPv6 tunnel and a default route over it is all is needed to
   get IPv4 connectivity.  Dealing with high availability is the
   responsibility of the service provider, not the customer devices
   implementing dual-stack lite.  As such, a single IPv6 address of the
   tunnel end-point is provided in the DHCPv6 option defined in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option].  The service provider can
   use techniques such as anycast or various types of clusters to ensure
   availability of the IPv4 service.  The exact synchronization (or lack
   thereof) between redundant AFTRs is out of scope for this document.

15.4.  Logging

   DS-Lite AFTR implementation should offer the possility to log NAT
   binding creations or other ways to keep track of the ports/IP
   addresses used by customers.  This is both to support
   troubleshooting, which is very important to service providers trying
   to figure out why something may not be working, as well as to meet
   region-specific requirements for responding to legally-binding
   requests for information from law enforcement authorities.
