1. Introduction 

   [RFC4655] defines the PCE based Architecture and explains how a Path 
   Computation Element (PCE) may compute Label Switched Paths (LSP) in 
   Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and 
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks at the request of Path Computation 
   Clients (PCCs).  A PCC is shown to be any network component that 
   makes such a request and may be for instance an Optical Switching 
   Element within a Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) network.  The 
   PCE, itself, can be located anywhere within the network, and may be 
   within an optical switching element, a Network Management System 
   (NMS) or Operational Support System (OSS), or may be an independent 
   network server. 

   The PCE communications Protocol (PCEP) is the communication protocol 
   used between PCC and PCE, and may also be used between cooperating 
   PCEs.  [RFC4657] sets out the common protocol requirements for PCEP.  
   Additional application-specific requirements for PCEP are deferred to 
   separate documents. 

   This document provides a set of application-specific PCEP 
   requirements for support of path computation in Wavelength Switched 
   Optical Networks (WSON) with impairments.  WSON refers to WDM based 
   optical networks in which switching is performed selectively based on 
   the wavelength of an optical signal.   

   The path in WSON is referred to as a lightpath.  A lightpath may span 
   multiple fiber links and the path should be assigned a wavelength for 
   each link.  A transparent optical network is made up of optical 
   devices that can switch but not convert from one wavelength to 
   another. In a transparent optical network, a lightpath operates on 
   the same wavelength across all fiber links that it traverses. In such 
   case, the lightpath is said to satisfy the wavelength-continuity 
   constraint. Two lightpaths that share a common fiber link can not be 
   assigned the same wavelength.  To do otherwise would result in both 
   signals interfering with each other. Note that advanced additional 
   multiplexing techniques such as polarization based multiplexing are 
   not addressed in this document since the physical layer aspects are 
   not currently standardized. Therefore, assigning the proper

   wavelength on a lightpath is an essential requirement in the optical 
   path computation process.   

   When a switching node has the ability to perform wavelength 
   conversion the wavelength-continuity constraint can be relaxed, and a 
   lightpath may use different wavelengths on different links along its 
   route from origin to destination. It is, however, to be noted that 
   wavelength converters may be limited due to their relatively high 
   cost, while the number of WDM channels that can be supported in a 
   fiber is also limited. As a WSON can be composed of network nodes 
   that cannot perform wavelength conversion, nodes with limited 
   wavelength conversion, and nodes with full wavelength conversion 
   abilities, wavelength assignment is an additional routing constraint 
   to be considered in all lightpath computation.  

   One of the most basic questions in communications is whether one can 
   successfully transmit information from a transmitter to a receiver 
   within a prescribed error tolerance, usually specified as a maximum 
   permissible bit error ratio (BER). This generally depends on the 
   nature of the signal transmitted between the sender and receiver and 
   the nature of the communications channel between the sender and 
   receiver. The optical path utilized (along with the wavelength) 
   determines the communications channel.  

   The optical impairments incurred by the signal along the fiber and at 
   each optical network element along the path determine whether the BER 
   performance or any other measure of signal quality can be met for 
   this particular signal on this particular path. Given the existing 
   standards covering optical characteristics (impairments) and the 
   knowledge of how the impact of impairments may be estimated along a 
   path, [WSON-IMP] provides a framework for impairment aware path 
   computation and establishment utilizing GMPLS protocols and the PCE 
   architecture. 

   Some optical subnetworks are designed such that over any path the 
   degradation to an optical signal due to impairments never exceeds 
   prescribed bounds. This may be due to the limited geographic extent 
   of the network, the network topology, and/or the quality of the 
   fiber and devices employed. In such networks the path selection 
   problem reduces to determining a continuous wavelength from source 
   to destination (the Routing and Wavelength Assignment problem). 
   These networks are discussed in [WSON-Frame]. In other optical 
   networks, impairments are important and the path selection process 
   must be impairment-aware.  

   In this document we first review the processes for routing and 
   wavelength assignment (RWA) used when wavelength continuity

   constraints are present. We then review the processes for optical 
   impairment aware RWA (IA-RWA). Based on selected process models we 
   then specify requirements for PCEP to support IA-RWA. Note that 
   requirements for PCEP to support RWA are specified in a separate 
   document [PCEP-RWA].  

   The remainder of this document uses terminology from [RFC4655].  

1.1. WSON RWA Processes (no impairments) 

   In [WSON-Frame] three alternative process architectures were given 
   for performing routing and wavelength assignment. These are shown 
   schematically in Figure 1.

                    Figure 1 RWA process alternatives. 

   These alternatives have the following properties and impact on PCEP 
   requirements in this document. 

   1. Combined Processes (R&WA) - Here path selection and wavelength 
      assignment are performed as a single process. The requirements for 
      PCC-PCE interaction with such a combined RWA process PCE is 
      addressed in this document. 

   2. Routing separate from Wavelength Assignment (R+WA) - Here the 
      routing process furnishes one or more potential paths to the 
      wavelength assignment process that then performs final path 
      selection and wavelength assignment.  The requirements for PCE-PCE 
      interaction with one PCE implementing the routing process and 
      another implementing the wavelength assignment process are not 
      addressed in this document.

   3. Routing and distributed Wavelength Assignment (R+DWA) - Here a 
      standard path computation (unaware of detailed wavelength 
      availability) takes place, then wavelength assignment is performed 
      along this path in a distributed manner via signaling (RSVP-TE). 
      This alternative should be covered by existing or emerging GMPLS 
      PCEP extensions and does not present new WSON specific 
      requirements. 

    

1.2. WSON IA-RWA Processes 

   In [WSON-IMP] impairments were addressed by adding an "impairment 
   validation" (IV) process. For approximate impairment validation three 
   process alternatives were given in [WSON-IMP] and shown in Figure 2.

   1. Combined IV and RWA Process - Here the processes of impairment 
      validation, routing and wavelength assignment are aggregated into 
      a single PCE. The requirements for PCC-PCE interaction with such a 
      combined IV-RWA process PCE is addressed in this document. 

   2. IV-Candidates + RWA Process - As explained in [WSON-IMP] 
      separating the impairment validation process from the RWA process 
      maybe necessary to deal with impairment sharing constraints. In 
      this architecture one PCE computes impairment candidates and 
      another PCE uses this information while performing RWA. The 
      requirements for PCE-to-PCE interaction of this architecture will 
      be addressed in this document. 

   3. Routing + Distributed WA and IV - Here a standard path computation 
      (unaware of detailed wavelength availability or optical 
      impairments) takes place, then wavelength assignment and 
      impairment validation is performed along this path in a 
      distributed manner via signaling (RSVP-TE). This alternative 
      should be covered by existing or emerging GMPLS PCEP extensions 
      and does not present new WSON specific requirements. 

2. WSON PCE Architectures and Requirements 

   In the previous section we reviewed various process architectures for 
   implementing RWA with and without regard for optical impairment. In 
   Figure 3 we reduce these alternatives to two PCE based 
   implementations. In Figure 3(a) we show the three processes of 
   routing, wavelength assignment and impairment validation accessed via 
   a single PCE. The implementation details of the interactions of the 
   processes are not subject to standardization in this case only the 
   PCC to PCE communications.  

   In Figure 3(b) the impairment validation process is implemented in a 
   separate PCE. Here the RWA-PCE acts as a coordinator and the PCC to 
   RWA-PCE interface will be the same as in Figure 3(a), however in this 
   case we have additional requirements for the RWA-PCE to IV-PCE 
   interface.

2.1. RWA PCC to PCE Interface 

   The PCC to PCE interface of Figure 3(a) and the PCC to PCD-PCE 
   (coordinator) interface of Figure 3(b) are the same and we will cover 
   both in this section. The following requirements for these interfaces 
   are arranged by use cases: 

      2.1.1.  A new RWA path request  

   1. The PCRep Message MUST include the route, wavelengths assigned to 
      the route and an indicator that says if the path has passed an 
      optical quality check. In the case where a valid path is not 
      found, the PCRep Message MUST include why the path is not found 
      (e.g., no route, wavelength not found, BER failure, etc.) 

   2. The PCReq Message MAY include the BER limit to which all feasible 
      paths should conform. Note that BER limits may be set at a network 
      level and hence this parameter may be optional. If no default BER 
      limit is provisioned at the PCE then the PCE will return an error 
      specifying that a BER limit must be provided.

      2.1.2.  An RWA path re-optimization request 

   1. If a BER limit was required in the original path request then a 
      BER limit MUST be furnished in the re-optimization request. 
      Otherwise, furnishing a BER limit is optional. 

2.2. RWA-PCE to IV-PCE Interface 

   In [WSON-IMP] a sequence diagram for the interaction of the PCC, RWA-
   PCE and IV-PCE of Figure 3(b) was given and is repeated here in 
   Figure 4. The interface between the PCC and the RWA-PCE (acting as 
   the coordinator) was covered in section 2.1.

                Coordinating-PCE and the IV-Candidates-PCE. 

   The interface between the RWA-Coord-PCE and the IV-Candidates-PCE is 
   specified by the following requirements:  

   1. The PCReq Message from the RWA-Coord-PCE to the IV-PCE MUST 
      include an indicator that more than one (candidate) path between 
      source and destination is desired.

   2. The PCReq message from the RWA-Coord-PCE to the IV-Candidates-PCE 
      MUST include a limit on the number of optical impairment qualified 
      paths to be returned by the IV-PCE. 

   3. The PCReq message from the RWA-Coord-PCE to the IV-Candidates-PCE 
      MAY include wavelength constraints. Note that optical impairments 
      are wavelength sensitive and hence specifying a wavelength 
      constraint may help limit the search for valid paths.  

   4. The PCRep Message from the IV-Candidates-PCE to RWA-Coord-PCE MUST 
      include a set of optical impairment qualified paths along with any 
      wavelength constraints on those paths.  

   5. The PCRep Message from the IV-Candidates-PCE to RWA-Coord-PCE MUST 
      indicate "no path found" in case where a valid path is not found.  

   Note that once the Combined RWA Process PCE receives the resulting 
   paths from the IV Candidates PCE, then the Combined RWA PCE computes 
   RWA for the IV qualified candidate paths and sends the result back to 
   the PCC.   

3. Manageability Considerations 

   Manageability of WSON Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) with 
   PCE must address the following considerations: 

3.1. Control of Function and Policy 

   In addition to the parameters already listed in Section 8.1 of 
   [PCEP], a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring the following 
   PCEP session parameters on a PCC: 

   o  The ability to send a WSON RWA request. 

   In addition to the parameters already listed in Section 8.1 of 
   [PCEP], a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring the following 
   PCEP session parameters on a PCE: 

   o  The support for WSON RWA. 

   o  The maximum number of synchronized path requests associated with 
      WSON RWA per request message. 

   o  A set of WSON RWA specific policies (authorized sender, request 
      rate limiter, etc).

Internet-Draft   PCEP Extension for WSON Impairments          June 2009 
    

   These parameters may be configured as default parameters for any PCEP 
   session the PCEP speaker participates in, or may apply to a specific 
   session with a given PCEP peer or a specific group of sessions with a 
   specific group of PCEP peers. 

 
3.2. Information and Data Models, e.g. MIB module 

   Extensions to the PCEP MIB module defined in [PCEP-MIB] should be 
   defined, so as to cover the WSON RWA information introduced in this 
   document. A future revision of this document will list the 
   information that should be added to the MIB module. 

3.3. Liveness Detection and Monitoring 

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness 
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already 
   listed in section 8.3 of [PCEP]. 

 
3.4. Verifying Correct Operation 

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new verification 
   requirements in addition to those already listed in section 8.4 of 
   [PCEP] 

 
3.5. Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components 

   The PCE Discovery mechanisms ([RFC5089] and [RFC5088]) may be used to 
   advertise WSON RWA path computation capabilities to PCCs. 

 
3.6. Impact on Network Operation 

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new network 
   operation requirements in addition to those already listed in section 
   8.6 of [PCEP]. 

    

4. Security Considerations 

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models 
   within PCEP [PCEP]. However the additional information distributed in 
   order to address the RWA problem represents a disclosure of network

   capabilities that an operator may wish to keep private. Consideration 
   should be given to securing this information.   

    

5. IANA Considerations 

   A future revision of this document will present requests to IANA for 
   codepoint allocation.
