1.  Introduction

   This document provides a guide to and template for the creation of
   new IANA registrations of Enumservices.  This document aims to
   enhance section 3 of RFC 3761 [2], where the registration procedure
   for Enumservices was initially documented at a high level.  However,
   the IETF's ENUM Working Group has encountered an unnecessary amount
   of variation in the format of Enumservice drafts presented to the
   group.  The ENUM Working Group's view of what particular fields and
   information are required and/or recommended has also evolved, and
   capturing these best current practices is helpful in both the
   creation of new registrations, as well as the revision or refinement
   of existing registrations.

   For the purpose of this document, 'registration document' and
   'registration' refers to an Internet Draft proposing the IANA
   registration of an Enumservice following the procedures outlined
   above.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


3.  Enumservice Creation Cookbook

3.1.  Preparation

   Before commencing work on a new Enumservice registration, the
   following should be considered:

   o  Is there an existing Enumservice which could fulfill the desired
      functionality without overloading it?  Check the IANA Enumservice
      registrations on <http://www.iana.org/assignments/enum-services>.

   o  Is there work in progress on a similar Enumservice?  Check the
      <enum@ietf.org> mailing list archives on
      <http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/enum/index.html>, and the
      Internet Drafts Archive on <http://tools.ietf.org/wg/enum/>.

3.2.  Classification, Name, Type and Subtype

   Because of its flexibility, Enumservices can be and are used in a lot
   of different ways.  This section contains a classification of
   Enumservices, and provides guidance for choosing suitable 'name',



Hoeneisen, et al.       Expires January 10, 2008                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        BCP Enumservice Registrations             Jul 2007


   'type' and 'subtype' strings for each individual Enumservice class.

3.2.1.  Choosing a "name" string

   Generally, the 'name' string used for registering an Enumservice
   SHOULD give a clear indication of what the Enumservice is about.
   This string is likely to be used for labeling instances of the
   Enumservice to end users, and has no technical significance in the
   processing of the NAPTR (since it does not even appear in the actual
   record).

3.2.2.  Protocol-based Enumservices

   Such an Enumservice indicates that an interaction using the named
   protocol will result for use of this NAPTR.  The expected behaviour
   of a system using this Enumservice MUST be clear from the protocol.

3.2.2.1.  Protocol-based Enumservice "type" strings

   A protocol-based Enumservice SHOULD use the name of the protocol (or
   the "base" URI scheme, where there are also secure variants) as its
   'type' name.

3.2.2.2.  Protocol-based Enumservice "subtype" strings

   Where there is a single URI scheme associated with this protocol,
   then the Enumservice SHOULD NOT use a subtype.

   Where a protocol is associated with a number of different URI
   schemes, the registration SHOULD define which of these is the default
   URI scheme, and register the empty subtype for use with this default
   scheme.

   The Enumservice registration SHOULD define subtypes for each of the
   non-default URI schemes with which it can be associated.  The use of
   the URI schema name as subtype string is RECOMMENDED.

   Where a NAPTR includes the default URI scheme, the Enumservice
   without a subtype SHOULD be used.  Where a non-default scheme is
   used, the Enumservice variant with type and respective sub-type
   SHOULD be used.

3.2.3.  Application-based Enumservices

   Application-based Enumservices are used when the kind of service
   intended is not fully defined by a protocol specification.  There are
   three cases here:




Hoeneisen, et al.       Expires January 10, 2008                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        BCP Enumservice Registrations             Jul 2007


   o  Common Application Enumservice:

      The application reflects a kind of interaction that can be
      realised by different protocols, but where the intent of the
      publisher is the same.  From a user's perspective, there is a
      common kind of interaction - how that interaction is implemented
      is not important.  The Enumservice registration MUST describe the
      interaction and expected behaviour in enough detail that an
      implementation can decide if this activity is one in which it can
      engage.  However, it is RECOMMENDED that the Enumservice is
      defined in a way that will allow others to use it at a later date.
      An Enumservice that defines a generalised application is preferred
      to one that has narrow use.

      An example of this flavour of Enumservice is email.  Whilst this
      might appear to be a "pure" protocol scheme, it is not.  The URI
      scheme is mailto:, and does not identify the protocol used by the
      sender or the recipient to offer or retrieve emails.

      Another example is sms, where the presence of such an Enumservice
      indicates that the publishing entity is capable of engaging in
      sending or receiving a message according to the Short Messaging
      Service specifications.  The underlying protocol used and the URI-
      scheme for the addressable end point can differ, but the "user
      visible" interaction of sending and receiving an SMS is similar.
   o  Subset Enumservice:

      The application interaction reflects a subset of the interactions
      possible by use of a protocol.  Use of this Enumservice indicates
      that some options available by use of the protocol will not be
      accepted or are not possible in this case.  Any such Enumservice
      registration MUST define the options available by use of this
      NAPTR in enough detail that an implementation can decide whether
      or not it can use this Enumservice.  Examples of this kind of
      Enumservice are voice:tel and fax:tel.  In both cases the URI
      holds a telephone number.  However, the essential feature of these
      Enumservices is that the telephone number is capable of receiving
      a voice call or of receiving a Facsimile transmission,
      respectively.  These form subsets of the interactions capable of
      using the telephone number, and so have their own Enumservices.
      These allow an end point to decide if it has the appropriate
      capability of engaging in the advertised user service (a voice
      call or sending a fax) rather than just being capable of making a
      connection to such a destination address.  This is especially
      important where there is no underlying mechanism within the
      protocol to negotiate a different kind of user interaction.

Internet-Draft        BCP Enumservice Registrations             Jul 2007


   o  Ancillary Application Enumservice

      Another variant on this is the Ancillary Application.  This is one
      in which further processing (potentially using a number of
      different protocols or methods) is the intended result of using
      this Enumservice.  An example of this kind of application is the
      PSTN:tel Enumservice.  This indicates that the NAPTR holds Number
      Portability data.  It implies that the client should engage in
      number portability processing using the associated URI.  Note that
      this Enumservice usually does not itself define the kind of
      interaction available using the associated URI.  That application
      is negotiated with some other "out of band" means (either through
      prior negotiation, or explicitly through the number portability
      process, or through negotiation following the selection of the
      final destination address).

3.2.4.  Data/Format Enumservice class

   "Data Format" Enumservices typically refer to a specific data type or
   format, which may be addressed using one or more URI schemes and
   protocols.  It is RECOMMENDED to use a well known name of the data
   type / format as the Enumservice 'type'.  An example of such an
   Enumservice is 'vpim' (RFC 4238) [9] and 'vCard' [13] (work in
   progress).


4.  Required Sections and Information

   In addition to the typical sections required for an RFC as outlined
   in RFC 2223bis [3] (Instructions to RFC Authors), there are several
   sections which MUST appear in an IANA Registration for an
   Enumservice.  These sections are, as follows, and SHOULD be in the
   same order.

   Appendix A contains a template which can be used to create Internet
   Drafts and RFC by means described on <http://xml.resource.org/>.
   This template contains a prototype for most of these sections.

4.1.  Introduction (MANDATORY)

   An introductory section MUST be included.  This section will explain,
   in plain English, the purpose of and intended usage of the proposed
   Enumservice registration.

   The Introduction SHOULD start with a short sentence about ENUM,
   introduce the protocol used in the Enumservice, and discuss the
   Enumservice as it refers from the E.164 number to the protocol or
   service.

Internet-Draft        BCP Enumservice Registrations             Jul 2007


4.2.  ENUM Service Registration

   This section MUST be included in an Enumservice registration.  In
   addition, where a given registration type has multiple subtypes,
   there MUST be a separate registration section for each subtype.  The
   following lists the sections and order of an Enumservice Registration
   section.  All types and subtypes SHOULD be listed in lower-case.

   Enumservice Name:

      A short word or stub sentence describing this Enumservice.  Often
      this is equivalent to the Enumservice Type (see below), however,
      capitalization may be different from it.

      e.g.  "Foo"

   Enumservice Type:

      The type of the Enumservice.  Often this is equivalent to the
      Enumservice Name (see above).

      e.g. "foo"


   Enumservice Subtype:

      The Subtype of the Enumservice.

      e.g. "bar"

      Many Enumservices do not require a subtype; use "N/A" in this
      case.

   URI Schemes:

      The URI Schemes, which are used with the Enumservice.

      e.g. "bar:", "sbar:"

      A URI scheme often matches the subtype (see above).  Multiple URI
      schemes can be listed here if they are used for the same subtype,
      and provide almost identical functionality.
      Note well that a client cannot choose a specific ENUM record in a
      record set based on the URI scheme - the selection is only based
      on 'type' and 'subtype'.

   Functional Specification:




Hoeneisen, et al.       Expires January 10, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        BCP Enumservice Registrations             Jul 2007


      e.g.  This Enumservice indicates that the remote resource
      identified can be addressed by the associated URI scheme in order
      to foo the bar.

   Security Considerations:

      An internal reference to the 'Security Considerations' section of
      a given registration document.

      e.g. "see Section 10"

   Intended Usage:

      One of "COMMON", "LIMITED USE" or "OBSOLETE", as defined in RFC
      3761 [2]

      e.g.  "COMMON"

   Author(s):

      The author(s) of the Enumservice registration.

      e.g.  John Doe <john.doe@example.com>

   Any other information the author(s) deem(s) interesting:

      e.g.  None

4.3.  Examples (MANDATORY)

   This section MUST show one or more example(s) of the Enumservice
   registration, for illustrative purposes.  The example(s) shall in no
   way limit the various forms that a given Enumservice may take, and
   this should be noted at the beginning of this section of the
   document.  The example(s) MUST show the specific formatting of the
   intended NAPTRs RFC 3403 [4], including one or more NAPTR example(s),
   AND a brief textual description, consisting of one or more sentences
   written in plain English, explaining the various parts or attributes
   of the record(s).

   The example(s) SHOULD contain a brief description how a client
   supporting this Enumservice could behave, if that description was not
   already given in e.g. the Introduction.

   e.g.

   $ORIGIN 9.7.8.0.9.7.8.9.0.9.4.4.e164.arpa.
   @ IN NAPTR 100 10 "u" "E2U+foo:bar" "!^.*$!bar://example.com/!" .

4.4.  Implementation Recommendations / Notes (OPTIONAL)

   If at all possible, recommendations that pertain to implementation
   and/or operations SHOULD be included.  Such a section is helpful to
   someone reading a registration and trying to understand how best to
   use it to support their network or service.

4.5.  Security Considerations (MANDATORY)

   A section explaining any potential security threats that are unique
   to the given registration MUST be included.  This MUST also include
   any information about access to Personally Identifiable Information
   (PII).

   However, this section is not intended as a general security Best
   Current Practices (BCP) document and therefore it should not include
   general and obvious security recommendations, such as securing
   servers with strong password authentication.

4.6.  IANA Considerations (MANDATORY)

   Describe the task IANA needs to fulfill processing the Enumservice
   registration document.

   e.g.  This memo requests registration of the "foo" Enumservice with
   the subtype "bar" according to the definitions in this document and
   RFC3761 [2].

4.7.  DNS Considerations (OPTIONAL)

   In case the inclusion of protocols and URI schemes into ENUM
   specifically introduces new DNS issues, those MUST be described
   within this section.

   Such DNS issues include, but are not limited to:

   o  Assumptions about the namespace below the owner of the respective
      NAPTR RRSet.

   o  Demand to use DNS wildcards.

   o  Incompatibility with DNS wildcards.

   o  presence or absence of the respective NAPTR RRSet at particular
      levels in the DNS hierarchy (e.g. only for 'full' E.164 numbers,
      or number blocks only).

Internet-Draft        BCP Enumservice Registrations             Jul 2007


   o  use of any RRs (especially non-NAPTR) within or beyond the
      e164.arpa namespace other than those needed to resolve the domain
      names that appear in the 'replacement' URI.

   Rationale: some ENUM services try to exploit side effects of the DNS
   that need to be explicitly discussed.

4.8.  Other Sections (OPTIONAL)

   Other sections, beyond those required by the IETF and/or IANA, which
   are cited or otherwise referenced here, MAY be included in an
   Enumservice registration.  These sections may relate to the specifics
   of the intended usage of the Enumservice registration and associated
   technical, operational, or administrative concerns.


5.  Revision of Pre-Existing Enumservice RFCs

   Several Enumservice registrations, published via IETF RFCs, already
   exist at the time of the development of this document.  The authors
   recommend that these existing registration documents SHOULD be
   reviewed and, where necessary and appropriate, MAY be revised in
   accordance with the recommendations contained herein.  All future
   Enumservice registrations SHOULD follow the recommendations contained
   herein, where practical and applicable.


6.  Extension of Existing Enumservice RFCs

   There are cases, where it is more sensible to extend an existing
   Enumservice registrations rather than proposing a new one.  Such
   cases include adding a new subtype to an existing type.  Depending on
   the nature of the extension, the original registration document needs
   to be extended (updates) or replaced (obsoletes) [3].


7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Considerations regarding this Document

   Since this document does not introduce any technology or protocol,
   there are no security issues to be considered for this memo itself.

7.2.  Enumservice Security Considerations Guideline

   Section 6 of RFC 3761 already outlines security considerations
   affecting ENUM as a whole.  Enumservice registration documents do not
   need and SHOULD NOT repeat considerations already listed there, but



Hoeneisen, et al.       Expires January 10, 2008               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft        BCP Enumservice Registrations             Jul 2007


   they SHOULD include a reference to that section.

   ENUM refers to resources using preexisting URI schemes and protocols.
   Enumservice registration documents do not need and SHOULD NOT repeat
   security considerations affecting those protocols and URI schemes
   itself.

   However, in case that the inclusion of those protocols and URI
   schemes into ENUM specifically introduces new security issues, those
   issues MUST be lined out in the 'Security Considerations' section of
   the registration document.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document itself does not define a new protocol, and therefore
   has no considerations for IANA.  However, it contains a proposal for
   the 'IANA Considerations' section of actual Enumservice registration
   documents in Appendix A.

   Note: Section 4.2 is just an example of an Enumservice registration.
   The Enumservice "foo" outlined there MUST NOT be registered by IANA
   unless this memo is to be published on April 1st.

   Classification section.  The authors also wish to thank Peter Koch

   <section anchor='sec' title='Security Considerations'>
         <t>As with any Enumservice, the security considerations of ENUM
         itself (Section 6 of RFC 3761) apply.
         </t>
         <section anchor='secrecord' title='The ENUM Record Itself'>
         <t>Since ENUM uses DNS - a publicly available database -
         any information contained in records provisioned in ENUM
         domains must be considered public as well. Even after revoking
         the DNS entry and removing the referred resource, copies of the
         information could still be available. </t>
         <t>
         Information published in ENUM records could reveal associations
         between E.164 numbers and their owners - especially if URIs
         contain personal identifiers or domain names for which
         ownership information can be obtained easily.
         For example, the following URI makes it easy to guess
         the owner of an E.164 number as well as his location and
         association by just examining the result from the ENUM lookup:
         <vspace blankLines='1'/>
         <list>
         <t>http://sandiego.company.example.com/joe-william-user.vcf</t>
         </list>
         </t>
         <t>However, it is important to note that the ENUM record itself
         does not need to contain any personal information. It just
         points to a location where access to personal information could
         be granted.  For example, the following URI only reveals the
         service provider hosting the vCard (who probably even provides
         anonymous hosting):
         <vspace blankLines='1'/>
         <list>
           <t>http://anonhoster.example.org/file_adfa001.vcf</t>
         </list>
         </t>
         <t>ENUM records pointing
         to third party resources can easily be provisioned on purpose
         by the ENUM domain owner - so any assumption
         about the association between a number and an entity could
         therefore be completely bogus unless some kind of identity
         verification is in place. This verification is out of scope for
         this memo.</t>

         <section anchor='secresource' title='The Resource Identified'>
