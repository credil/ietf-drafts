Abstract

   This document defines a standard profile for Bogon Origin
   Attestations (BOAs).  A BOA is a digitally signed object that
   provides a means of verifying that an IP address block holder has not
   authorized any Autonomous System (AS) to originate routes that
   describe or encompass any of the addresses listed in the BOA, and
   also provides a means of verifying that BGP speaker is not using an
   AS as a BGP speaker without appropriate authority to use that AS.

   The proposed application of BOAs is intended to fit within the
   requirements for adding security to inter-domain routing, including
   the ability to support incremental and piecemeal deployment of
   security measures, and does not require any changes to the
   specification of BGP.

Internet-Draft             Bogon Attestations              February 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document defines an application of the Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI) to validate the attestations of Internet
   Registries that certain addresses are currently neither allocated nor
   assigned to any party, and any appearance of such addresses or ASes
   in a routing advertisement in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   [RFC4271] should be considered an invalid use of such addresses or
   ASes.

   The RPKI is based on on Resource Certificates.  Resource Certificates
   are X.509 certificates that conform to the PKIX profile [RFC3280],
   and to the extensions for IP addresses and AS identifiers [RFC3779].
   A Resource Certificate describes an action by an Issuer that binds a
   list of IP address blocks and Autonomous System (AS) numbers to the
   Subject of a certificate, identified by the unique association of the
   Subject's private key with the public key contained in the Resource
   Certificate.  The PKI is structured such that each current Resource
   Certificate matches a current resource allocation or assignment.
   This is described in [ID.ietf-sidr-arch].

   BOAs can be regarded as a logical opposite of a Route Origin
   Authorization (ROA) [ID.ietf-sidr-roa-format], and allows a resource
   holder to explicitly list those IP addresses and ASes that are
   denoted by the holder as not validly appearing in any routing
   advertisement, and to make this attestation in a manner that a
   relying party can validate under the framework of the RPKI.

   A BOA is a digitally signed object that makes use of Cryptographic
   Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC3852] as a standard encapsulation format.
   CMS was chosen to take advantage of existing open source software
   available for processing messages in this format.


2.  Basic Format

   Using CMS syntax, a BOA is a type of signed-data object.  The general
   format of a CMS object is:

         ContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
           contentType ContentType,
           content [0] EXPLICIT ANY DEFINED BY contentType }

         ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   As a BOA is a signed-data object, it uses the corresponding OID,
   1.2.840.113549.1.7.2.  [RFC3852].

2.1.  Signed-Data Content Type

   According to the CMS standard, the signed-data content type shall
   have ASN.1 type SignedData:

         SignedData ::= SEQUENCE {
           version CMSVersion,
           digestAlgorithms DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers,
           encapContentInfo EncapsulatedContentInfo,
           certificates [0] IMPLICIT CertificateSet OPTIONAL,
           crls [1] IMPLICIT RevocationInfoChoices OPTIONAL,
           signerInfos SignerInfos }

         DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers ::= SET OF DigestAlgorithmIdentifier

         SignerInfos ::= SET OF SignerInfo

2.1.1.  version

   The version is the syntax version number.  It MUST be 3,
   corresponding to the signerInfo structure having version number 3.

2.1.2.  digestAlgorithms

   The digestAlgorithms set MUST include only SHA-256, the OID for which
   is 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1.  [RFC4055] It MUST NOT contain any other
   algorithms.

2.1.3.  encapContentInfo

   encapContentInfo is the signed content, consisting of a content type
   identifier and the content itself.

         EncapsulatedContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
           eContentType ContentType,
           eContent [0] EXPLICIT OCTET STRING OPTIONAL }

         ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

2.1.3.1.  eContentType

   The ContentType for a BOA is defined as routeOriginAttestation and
   has the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.[TBS].

         id-smime OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840)
             rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) 16 }

         id-ct OBJECT INDENTIFIER ::= { id-smime 1 }

         BogonOriginAttestion OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ct [TBS] }

2.1.3.2.  eContent

   The content of a BOA identifies a list of one or more ASs and a list
   of one or more IP address prefixes that are asserted to be "bogons"
   and, accordingly, BOAs are intended to act as a constraint on the
   routing system to signal that no route object that that includes
   these ASs or IP addresses should be interpreted as representing a
   valid routing attestation.  A BOA is formally defined as:

         BogonOriginAttestation ::= {
            version [0] INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
            asIDs        SEQUENCE OF asIdsOrRange,
            ipAddrBlocks BOAIPAddrBlocks }

         ASIdOrRange   ::= CHOICE {
            id               ASId,
            range            ASRange }

         ASRange       ::= SEQUENCE {
            min              ASId,
            max              ASId }

         ASId          ::= INTEGER

         BOAIPAddrBlocks ::= SEQUENCE of BOAIPAddressFamily

         BOAIPAddressFamily ::= SEQUENCE {
            addressFamily OCTET STRING (SIZE (2..3)),
            addresses SEQUENCE OF IPAddress }

         IPAddress ::= BIT STRING

2.1.3.2.1.  version

   The version number of the BogonOriginAttestation MUST be 0.

2.1.3.2.2.  asIDs

   The asIDs field contains the AS numbers that are to be regarded as
   Bogon ASes.  The set of AS numbers may be explictly listed, or
   specified as a continuous range of values.  (See [RFC3779] for more

   details.)

2.1.3.2.3.  BOAipAddrBlocks

   The BOAipAddrBlocks field encodes the set of IP address prefixes that
   are to be regarded as Bogon IP addresses that are to be constrained
   from appearing in any routing advertisement.  The intended semantics
   is that any route object that has the same address prefix as that
   listed as a Bogin, or is a more general prefix that encompasses any
   Bogon address prefix, or is a more specific prefix of a Bogin is a
   Bogon.

   Note that the syntax here is more restrictive than that used in the
   IP Address Delegation extension defined in RFC 3779.  That extension
   can represent arbitrary address ranges, whereas BOAs contain only
   prefixes.

   Within the BOAIPAddressFamily structure, addressFamily contains the
   Address Family Identifier (AFI) of an IP address family.  This
   specification only supports IPv4 and IPv6.  Therefore, addressFamily
   MUST be either 0001 or 0002.  The addresses field represents prefixes
   as a sequence of type IPAddress.  (See [RFC3779] for more details.)

2.1.3.3.  certificates

   The certificates field MAY be included.  If so, it MUST contain only
   the end entity certificate needed to validate this BOA.  This
   certificate should be present only if the BOA is being transmitted to
   a relying party.  Thus in the initial use of BOAs, where they are
   being made available to relying parties via a repository system, this
   certificate SHOULD be omitted.

2.1.3.4.  crls

   The crls field MUST be omitted.

2.1.3.5.  signerInfo

   SignerInfo is defined under CMS as:

         SignerInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
           version CMSVersion,
           sid SignerIdentifier,
           digestAlgorithm DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
           signedAttrs [0] IMPLICIT SignedAttributes OPTIONAL,
           signatureAlgorithm SignatureAlgorithmIdentifier,
           signature SignatureValue,
           unsignedAttrs [1] IMPLICIT UnsignedAttributes OPTIONAL }

Internet-Draft             Bogon Attestations              February 2008


2.1.3.5.1.  version

   The version number MUST be 3, corresponding with the choice of
   SubjectKeyIdentifier for the sid.

2.1.3.5.2.  sid

   The sid is defined as:

         SignerIdentifier ::= CHOICE {
           issuerAndSerialNumber IssuerAndSerialNumber,
           subjectKeyIdentifier [0] SubjectKeyIdentifier }

   For a BOA, the sid MUST be a SubjectKeyIdentifier.

2.1.3.5.3.  digestAlgorithm

   The digestAlgorithm MUST be SHA-256, the OID for which is
   2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1.  [RFC4055]

2.1.3.5.4.  signedAttrs

   signedAttrs MUST be omitted.

2.1.3.5.5.  signatureAlgorithm

   The signatureAlgorithm MUST be RSA (rsaEncryption), the OID for which
   is 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1.

2.1.3.5.6.  signature

   The signature value is defined as:

         SignatureValue ::= OCTET STRING

   The signature characteristics are defined by the digest and signature
   algorithms.

2.1.3.5.7.  unsignedAttrs

   unsignedAttrs MUST be omitted.


3.  BOA Validation

   Before a relying party can use a BOA as a constrictor of a routing
   announcement, the relying party must use the RPKI to validate the
   BOA.  To do this the relying party performs the following steps:



Huston, et al.           Expires August 21, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             Bogon Attestations              February 2008


   1.  Verify that the BOA syntax complies with this specification.  In
       particular, verify the following:

       A.  The contentType of the CMS object is SignedData (OID
           1.2.840.113549.1.7.2)

       B.  The version of the SignedData object is 3.
       C.  The digestAlgorithm in the SignedData object is SHA-256 (OID
           2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1).

       D.  The crls field in the SignedData object is omitted.

       E.  The eContentType in the EncapsulatedContentInfo is
           BogonOriginAttestation (OID 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.[TBS]).

       F.  The version of the BogonOriginAttestation is 0.

       G.  The addressFamily in the BOAIPAddressFamily is either IPv4 or
           IPv6 (0001 and 0002, respectively).

       H.  The version of the SignerInfo is 3.

       I.  The digestAlgorithm in the SignerInfo object is SHA-256 (OID
           2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1).

       J.  The signatureAlgorithm in the SignerInfo object is RSA (OID
           1.2.840.113549.1.1.1).

       K.  The signedAttrs field in the SignerInfo object is omitted.

       L.  The unsignedAttrs field in the SignerInfo object is omitted.

   2.  Obtain an EE certificate that has a Subject Key Identifier (SKI)
       that matches the sid field of the SignerInfo object.  This
       certificate may be obtained from the certificates field of the
       SignedData object (if present), the RPKI repository system, or a
       local cache.

   3.  Use the public key in the EE certificate to verify the signature
       on the BOA.

   4.  Verify that the EE certificate has an IP Address Delegation
       extension [RFC3779] and that the IP address prefix(es) in that
       extension exactly matches the IP address prefix(es) in the BOA,
       and the AS numbers in that extension exactly match the AS numbers
       in the BOA.

Internet-Draft             Bogon Attestations              February 2008


   5.  Verify that the EE certificate is a valid end-entity certificate
       in the resource PKI by constructing a valid certificate path to a
       trust anchor.  (See [ID.ietf-sidr-res-certs] for more details.)

   Note that requiring an exact match between the IP address prefixes
   and ASes in a BOA and the IP address prefixes and ASes in the
   corresponding EE certificate does not place any limitations on BOA
   use.  Since each EE certificate in the RPKI architecture is used to
   verify only a single BOA, it is natural to have the IP address
   prefixes in the certificate match those in the corresponding BOA.


4.  BOA Use Practices

   BOAs are intended to allow relying parties a means of validating
   whether route origination information as described in a route
   advertisement refers to an IP address or AS number that has not been
   validly allocated for use in the routing system.

   Any party with a validly assigned Internet resource set and a CA
   certificate that described this delegation can publish a BOA,
   independently of the actions of the actions of the party that
   assigned the resource set.  BOAs are not hierarchically related.

   An Internet Registry SHOULD maintain a single BOA in relation to each
   parent registry that has assigned resources to this registry.

   An Internet Registry SHOULD maintain a regular issuance cycle for
   BOAs.

   For registries that operate on a day-to-day basis in terms of
   resource transactions, it is suggested that a local BOA management
   practice would be that a new BOA should be issued on a regular 24
   hour basis.  The corresponding EE certificate should have a validity
   period of no more than 72 hours from the time of issuance.  Each time
   a new EE certificate for a BOA is issued the previous BOA's EE
   certificate should be revoked and the previous BOA removed from the
   publication repository.

   Parties that operate a local cache of RPKI objects should ensure that
   they refresh BOA objects at intervals 24 hours to ensure that they
   have the current BOA in the local cache.


5.  BOA Interpretation

   A BOA can be used to check a route object to determine if the
   origination information in the route object refers to invalid IP



Huston, et al.           Expires August 21, 2008                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             Bogon Attestations              February 2008


   addresses or an invalid AS number.

   These procedures are applied by a BGP speaker during the BGP Route
   selection process prior to the procedures described in Section 3 of
   [ID.huston-sidr-roa-validation].  The local policies that apply to
   Bogon route objects weould normally take the form of rejection of the
   route object via the application of a Bogon filter.

   If a route object has an AS origination that refers to an AS number
   that is included in a valid BOA then the route object can be regarded
   as a Bogon object, and local policies that apply to Bogon ASes can be
   applied to the object.  This holds whether or not the address prefix
   of the route object is described by a valid ROA or not.

   If a route object has an address prefix that is an aggregate of, or
   equal to, or is a more specific prefix of an IP address that is
   included in a valid BOA then the route object can be regarded as a
   Bogon object, and local policies that apply to Bogon ASes can be
   applied to the object, unless the address prefix and AS origination
   of the route object is also described by a valid ROA, in which case
   the BOA is to be disregarded.


6.  Security Considerations

   The purpose of a BOA is to convey an attestation by an address holder
   that there is no authority for the generation of a route object that
   refers to specified addresses or origination from specified ASes.
   The integrity of a BOA must be established in order to validate the
   authority of the Bogon Attestation.  The BOA makes use of the CMS
   signed message format for integrity, and thus inherits the security
   considerations associated with that data structure.  The right of the
   BOA signer to authorize the attestation of specified IP addresses and
   ASes as Bogons is established through use of the address space and AS
   number PKI described in [xref target="ID.draft-ietf-sidr-arch" />.
   Specifically, a relying party must verify the signature on the BOA
   using an X.509 certificate issued under this PKI, and check that the
   prefix(es) in the BOA match those in the address space extension in
   the certificate.
