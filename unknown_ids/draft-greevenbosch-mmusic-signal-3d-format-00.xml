        This document introduces the SDP attribute "3dFormat", 
        which provides format description of stereoscopic 3D video.
        In addition,
        the grouping mechanism for SDP is extended to cater for stereoscopic 3D video.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        In stereoscopic 3D multimedia applications, 
        two views are displayed, 
        one for the left eye and one for the right eye.
      </t>
      <t>
        There are various ways of formatting the views of Stereoscopic 3D video.
        Examples of 3D formats are frame packing (see <xref target="HDMIv1.4a"/>)
        and the combination of 2D video and auxiliary data such as depth maps
        (see <xref target="ISO/IEC 23002-3"/>).
        Stereoscopic 3D video may be carried over a single stream or over several streams,
        depending on its 3D format.
      </t>
      <t>               
        In multimedia streaming applications,
        the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC4566"/> 
        can be used to provide to the receiver sufficient information about the media streams,
        and to enable the receiver to join and participate in the session.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines an extension to SDP that provides sufficient information about the format of stereoscopic 3D video carried in the media stream(s).
        Before accessing the stream(s),
        the receiver can use the 3D format description from SDP to determine whether it has the capability to receive and render the stereoscopic 3D video content,
        and whether it can participate in the session.
      </t>
      <t>
        The mentioned SDP extension is a new SDP attribute "3dFormat",
        which provides the format description of stereoscopic 3D video.
        The design of the attribute is based on the following requirements,
        which are listed only for informational purposes:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            It SHALL be possible to signal that the left and right views are carried in a single stream,
            by the use of frame packing.
          </t>
          <t>
            It SHALL be possible to signal that 2D video and auxiliary video (such as depth maps) are carried in a single stream.
          </t>
          <t>
            It SHALL be possible to signal that the left and right views are carried in two separate streams.
          </t>
          <t>
            It SHALL be possible to signal that 2D video and auxiliary video (such as depth maps) are carried in separate streams.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>        
        To bind multiple video streams that carry a single stereoscopic 3D video, 
        this document also extends the SDP grouping mechanism from <xref target="RFC5888"/>.

    <section title="The &quot;3dFormat&quot; attribute">
      <t>
        The media-level SDP attribute "3dFormat" signals the format of stereoscopic 3D video.
        The attribute transfers this information through two parameters:
        one indicating the format type of the stereoscopic 3D video carried in the media stream(s),
        and the other indicating the type of the video component, 
        which is a constituent element of the stereoscopic 3D video.
        The video component type depends on the format type of the stereoscopic 3D video. 
	The syntax of the attribute is defined as follows:
      </t>

            The L- and R-views are packed into a single stream.

    <section title="Grouping">
      <t>
        When multiple streams carry a single stereoscopic 3D video,
        (e.g. C-stream and parallax map, or separately transmitted L- and R-streams),
        the grouping mechanism from <xref target="RFC5888"/> MUST be used.
      </t>
      <t>
        However,
        to cater for the special requirements of 3D signalling,
        the semantics are expanded:
      </t>
      <figure title="">
        <artwork align="center">
group-attribute     = "a=group:" semantics *(SP identification-tag)
semantics           = "LS" / "FID" / "3DS" / semantics-extension
semantics-extension = token
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
        The grouping is needed when multiple streams carry a single stereoscopic 3D video.
        This is the case when the &lt;format type&gt; is "SC",
        or the &lt;format type&gt; is "2DA" and the 2D video and auxiliary data are transmitted as multiple streams.
        A group with the "3Ds" semantics is called a "3DS group".
      </t>
      <t>
        A 3DS group MUST NOT contain data that is (potentially) inconsistent with other data in the 3DS group:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            A 3DS group MUST NOT contain both a parallax map stream and a depth map stream.
          </t>
          <t>
            A 3DS group MUST NOT contain more than one parallax map stream.
          </t>
          <t>
            A 3DS group MUST NOT contain more than one depth map stream.
          </t>
          <t>
            A 3DS group MUST contain at least one 2D video stream.
          </t>
          <t>
            If a 3GS group contains an L- and an R-stream, 
            it MUST NOT contain a depth map or a parallax map.
          </t>
          <t>
            If a 3DS group contains only one 2D video stream, 
            it MUST also contain a parallax map stream or a depth map stream.
          </t>
          <t>
            If a 3DS group contains a parallax map stream or a depth map stream,
            it MUST also contain a 2D video stream.

            When an entry in the table contains a single &lt;Component Type&gt; value CTsec,

            When multiple &lt;Component Type&gt; values are listed,
            separated by a "/" symbol,
            only one secondary stream is needed,

            and the same &lt;Format Type&gt; value FT.
          </t>
          <t>
            When an entry contains "3DS",
            it means that a 3DS group is needed.

          <t>
            When an entry in the table contains the letter "T" (true),
            it means that the corresponding combination FT and CT is allowed,
            that there is no required secondary stream,
            and that a 3DS group is not needed.

          One consists of stream 1 (C-stream) and stream 2 (parallax map stream),
