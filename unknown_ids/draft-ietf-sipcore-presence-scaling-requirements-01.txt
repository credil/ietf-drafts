1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The document lists requirements for optimizations of SIP/SIMPLE.  See
   [I-D.ietf-simple-simple] for the list of RFCs and drafts that are
   considered as part of SIP/SIMPLE.  These optimizations should reduce
   the load on the network and the presence servers due to inter-domain
   presence subscriptions.  The need for the requirements is based on a
   separate scaling analysis document
   [I-D.ietf-simple-interdomain-scaling-analysis].

   The scaling analysis document shows that the following aspects of
   SIP/SIMPLE can be optimized: the number of bytes sent between two
   federating domains, the number of messages processed, and the amount
   of state managed by the presence server.

   For example, for two peering networks that have a total of 20 million
   users, we calculated that approximately 19 billion messages per 8
   hours work day are exchanged between the networks for the presence
   service.

   For very large session peering (150 million subscriptions), we
   calculated that the presence server needs to manage approximately a
   terabyte of state.

   It may be that very large systems require the deployment of
   significant resources, but we should consider the following:

   o  The scaling analysis document makes moderate assumptions about the
      number of presence status changes per hour and the the size of the
      presence document.

   o  Even when applying all optimizations for presence as described by
      drafts and RFCs, we still calculated around 10 billion messages
      per 8 hours work day for a total of 20 million federating users.
      This is better than the base case, but not enough given the
      moderate assumptions and given that, when presence is deployed in
      a mass market, the number of federating users will be much larger
      than 20 million.

3.  Requirements

   This section lists the requirements for a solution that optimizes the
   inter-domain presence loads.  The requirements are based on the
   presence scaling draft
   [I-D.ietf-simple-interdomain-scaling-analysis].

3.1.  Backward Compatibility Requirements

   o  REQ-001: The solution SHOULD NOT deprecate existing protocol
      mechanisms defined in SIP/SIMPLE.

   o  REQ-002: Existing SIP/SIMPLE clients SHOULD be able to communicate
      with clients and servers that implement new presence scaling
      features.

   o  REQ-003: The solution SHOULD NOT constrain any existing RFC
      functional requirements for presence.

   o  REQ-004: The solution MUST NOT constrain any existing RFC security
      requirements for presence.

   o  REQ-005: Systems that do not use the new additions to the protocol
      SHOULD operate at the same level as they do today.


3.2.  Policy, Privacy, Permissions Requirements

   o  REQ-006: The solution SHOULD NOT limit the ability of presentities
      to present different views of presence to different watchers.

   o  REQ-007: The solution SHOULD NOT restrict the ability of a
      presentity to obtain its list of watchers.

   o  REQ-008: The solution MUST NOT create any new privacy holes or
      make any existing ones worse.


3.3.  Scalability Requirements

   o  REQ-009: Presence systems (intra- or inter-domain) SHOULD scale in
      linear proportion to the number of watchers and presentities in
      the system.

   o  REQ-010: The solution SHOULD NOT require a significant increase in
      the size of maintained state, compared to the current state size
      required by SIP/SIMPLE.

Internet-Draft      Scaling Requirements for Presence          July 2009


   o  REQ-011: The solution MUST allow presence systems to scale.  Note:
      we view scalability on the order of tens of millions of users in
      each peer domain.

   o  REQ-012: The solution MUST support a high percentage of watcher/
      presentity intersections between the domains and it MUST support
      various intersection models such as either small or large
      percentage of users from each domain subscribing to users from the
      other domain.

   o  REQ-013: Protocol changes MUST NOT prohibit optimizations in
      deployment models where there is a high number of inter-domain
      subscriptions.

   o  REQ-014: New functionalities and extensions to the presence
      protocol SHOULD consider scalability with respect to the number of
      messages, state size, and management and processing load.


3.4.  Topology Requirements

   o  REQ-015: The solution SHOULD allow for arbitrary federation
      topologies including direct and indirect peering.



4.  Considerations for Possible Optimizations

   This section discusses the possible paths for optimization.  One of
   the most important considerations is whether SIP, which was designed
   more as an end-to-end protocol, needs to be optimized for direct
   interactions between presence servers.

   It is very possible that the issues described here are inherent to
   presence systems in general and not specific to SIP/SIMPLE.
   Organizations need to be prepared to invest substantial resources in
   the form of networks and hardware in order to create sizable systems.
   However, it is apparent that additional protocol optimizations are
   possible and further IETF work is needed in order to provide better
   scalability of large presence systems.

   We should remember that SIP was originally designed for end-to-end
   session creation and that the number and size of messages are of
   secondary importance for an end-to-end session negotiation protocol.
   For large scale and especially for very large scale presence, the
   number of messages and the size of each message are of extreme
   importance.  Care must be taken to address scalability during the
   initial phase of protocol design; shoehorning scalability at a later



Houri, et al.           Expires January 14, 2010                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      Scaling Requirements for Presence          July 2009


   phase will be doomed to failure.

   We should also consider whether using the same protocol between
   clients and servers and between servers is a good choice.  It may be
   that, between inter-domain servers or even intra-domain servers (such
   as between RLSes [RFC4662] and presence servers), there needs to be a
   different protocol that is optimized for the load and that can make
   assumptions about the network (using only TCP, for example.  In
   [I-D.ietf-simple-interdomain-scaling-analysis], see the section that
   calculates the number of bytes and messages for an imaginary,
   optimized SIP).

   When a presence server connects to another server using current SIP/
   SIMPLE, there is an extreme number of redundant messages due to SIP's
   support of both TCP and UDP and due to privacy controls that cause
   the sending of multiple presence documents for the same presentity.
   A server-to-server protocol will have to address these issues.  Some
   initial work to address= these issues can be found in:
   [I-D.ietf-simple-view-sharing] and
   [I-D.ietf-simple-intradomain-federation] and in other (still
   individual) drafts.

   Another issue related to protocol design is whether NOTIFY messages
   should not be considered as media just like audio, video, and even
   text messaging.  The SUBSCRIBE method may be extended to negotiate
   the route and other parameters of the NOTIFY messages, similar to the
   way the INVITE method negotiates media parameters.  This way, the
   load can be shifted to specialized NOTIFY "relays" and taken off the
   control path of SIP.  One of the possible ideas (Marc Willekens) is
   to use SIP for client/server NOTIFY but use a more optimized and
   controllable protocol for the server-to-server interface.  Another
   possibility is to use the MSRP [RFC4975], [RFC4976] protocol for the
   notifications.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses the scalability requirements for the existing
   SIP/SIMPLE protocol and model.  Many of the above-mentioned changes
   to the protocol will have security implications.

   For example, a potential protocol change that may have security
   implications is the single sending of a presence document between
   domains in order to reduce the number of messages and network load.
   This possible optimization will delegate privacy protection from one
   domain to the other, and this delegated protection should be
   addressed during design.

   An important part of work on the requirements and optimizations will
   be to ensure that all the security aspects are covered.
