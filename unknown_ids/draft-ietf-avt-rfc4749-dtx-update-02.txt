Internet-Draft         G.729.1 DTX support in RTP         September 2008


1.  Introduction

   The International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) Recommendation
   G.729.1 [ITU-G.729.1] is a scalable and wideband extension of the
   Recommendation G.729 [ITU-G.729] audio codec.  [RFC4749] specifies
   the payload format for packetization of G.729.1 encoded audio signals
   into the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].

   The Annex C of G.729.1 [ITU-G.729.1-C] adds Discontinuous
   Transmission (DTX) support to G.729.1.  This document updates the RTP
   payload format to allow usage of this Annex.

   Only changes or additions to [RFC4749] will be described in the
   following sections.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT","RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Background

   G.729.1 supports Discontinuous Transmission (DTX), a.k.a. "silence
   suppression".  It means that the coder includes a Voice Activity
   Detection (VAD) algorithm, to determine if an audio frame contains
   silence or actual audio.  During silence periods, the coder may
   significantly decrease the transmitted bit rate by sending a small
   frame called Silence Insertion Descriptor (SID), and then stop
   transmission.  The receiver's decoder will generate comfort noise
   (CNG) according to the parameters contained in the SID.  This DTX/CNG
   scheme is specified in [ITU-G.729.1-C].

   G.729.1 SID has an embedded structure.  The core SID is the same as
   the legacy G.729 SID [ITU-G.729-B].  A first enhancement layer adds
   some parameters for narrowband comfort noise, while a second
   enhancement layer adds wideband information.  G.729.1 SID can be 2,
   3, or 6 octets long.


3.  RTP Header Usage

   The fields of the RTP header must be used as described in [RFC4749],
   except for the Marker (M) bit.

   If DTX is used, the first packet of a talkspurt, that is, the first
   packet after a silence period during which packets have not been
   transmitted contiguously, MUST be distinguished by setting the M bit
   in the RTP data header to one.  The M bit in all other packets MUST

Internet-Draft         G.729.1 DTX support in RTP         September 2008


   be set to zero.  The beginning of a talkspurt MAY be used to adjust
   the playout delay to reflect changing network delays.

   If DTX is not used, the M bit MUST be set to zero in all packets.


4.  Payload Format

   The payload format is the same as in [RFC4749], with the option to
   add a SID at the end.

   So the complete payload consists of a payload header of 1 octet (MBS
   and FT fields), followed by zero or more consecutive audio frames at
   the same bit rate, followed by zero or one SID.

      Note that it is consistent with the payload format of G.729
      described in section 4.5.6 of [RFC3551].

   To be able to transport a SID alone, that is, without actual audio
   frames, we assign the FT value 14 to SID.  The actual SID size (2, 3,
   or 6 octets) is inferred from the payload size: it is the size of
   what is left after the payload header.

   When a SID is appended to actual audio frames, the FT value remains
   the one describing the encoding rate of the audio frames.  Since the
   SID is much smaller than any other frame, it can be easily detected
   at the receiver side, and it will not hinder the calculation of the
   number of frames.  The actual SID size is inferred from the payload
   size: it is the size of what is left after the audio frames.

   The full FT table is given for convenience:

   DTX has no impact on the MBS definition and use.


5.  Payload Format Parameters

   Parameters defined in [RFC4749] are not modified.  We add a new
   optional parameter to configure DTX.

5.1.  Media Type Registration Update

   We add a new optional parameter to the audio/G7291 media subtype:

   dtx:  indicates that discontinuous transmission (DTX) is used or
      preferred.  Permissible values are 0 and 1. 0 means no DTX. 1
      means DTX support, as described in Annex C of ITU-T Recommendation
      G.729.1. 0 is implied if this parameter is omitted.

   When DTX is turned off, the RTP payload MUST NOT contain SID, and the
   FT value 14 MUST NOT be used.

5.2.  Mapping to SDP Parameters

   The information carried in the media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.

   The mapping described in [RFC4749] remains unchanged.

Internet-Draft         G.729.1 DTX support in RTP         September 2008


   The "dtx" parameter goes in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute.

   Some example partial SDP session descriptions utilizing G.729.1
   encodings follow.

   Example 1: default parameters (DTX off)

      m=audio 57586 RTP/AVP 96
      a=rtpmap:96 G7291/16000

   Example 2: recommended packet duration of 40 ms (=2 frames), maximum
   bit rate is 20 kbps, DTX supported and preferred.

      m=audio 49987 RTP/AVP 97
      a=rtpmap:97 G7291/16000
      a=fmtp:97 maxbitrate=20000; dtx=1
      a=ptime:40

5.2.1.  DTX Offer-Answer Model Considerations

   The offer-answer model considerations of [RFC4749] fully apply.  In
   this section we only define the management of the "dtx" parameter.

   The "dtx" parameter concerns both sending and receiving, so both
   sides of a bi-directional session MUST have the same DTX setting.  If
   one party indicates it does not support DTX, DTX must be deactivated
   both ways.  In other words, DTX is actually activated if, and only
   if, "dtx=1" in the offer and in the answer.

   A special rule applies for multicast: the "dtx" parameter becomes
   declarative and MUST NOT be negotiated.  This parameter is fixed, and
   a participant MUST use the configuration that is provided for the
   session.

5.2.2.  DTX Declarative SDP Considerations

   The "dtx" parameter is declarative and provides the parameter that
   SHALL be used when receiving and/or sending the configured stream.


6.  Congestion Control

   The congestion control considerations of [RFC4749] apply.

   The use of DTX can help congestion control by reducing the number of
   transmitted RTP packets and the average bandwidth of audio streams.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC4749] apply.

   DTX introduces no new security issue.  The ability to interrupt
   transmission during silence periods is a well-known feature in RTP.


8.  IANA Considerations

   It is requested that one new parameter for media subtype (audio/
   G7291) is registered by IANA, see Section 5.1.
