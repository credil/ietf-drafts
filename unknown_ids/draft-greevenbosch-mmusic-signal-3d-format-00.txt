Internet-Draft              Signal 3D format                  March 2011


1.  Introduction

   In stereoscopic 3D multimedia applications, two views are displayed,
   one for the left eye and one for the right eye.

   There are various ways of formatting the views of Stereoscopic 3D
   video.  Examples of 3D formats are frame packing (see [HDMIv1.4a])
   and the combination of 2D video and auxiliary data such as depth maps
   (see [ISO/IEC 23002-3]).  Stereoscopic 3D video may be carried over a
   single stream or over several streams, depending on its 3D format.

   In multimedia streaming applications, the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] can be used to provide to the receiver
   sufficient information about the media streams, and to enable the
   receiver to join and participate in the session.

   This document defines an extension to SDP that provides sufficient
   information about the format of stereoscopic 3D video carried in the
   media stream(s).  Before accessing the stream(s), the receiver can
   use the 3D format description from SDP to determine whether it has
   the capability to receive and render the stereoscopic 3D video
   content, and whether it can participate in the session.

   The mentioned SDP extension is a new SDP attribute "3dFormat", which
   provides the format description of stereoscopic 3D video.  The design
   of the attribute is based on the following requirements, which are
   listed only for informational purposes:

   o  It SHALL be possible to signal that the left and right views are
      carried in a single stream, by the use of frame packing.

   o  It SHALL be possible to signal that 2D video and auxiliary video
      (such as depth maps) are carried in a single stream.

   o  It SHALL be possible to signal that the left and right views are
      carried in two separate streams.

   o  It SHALL be possible to signal that 2D video and auxiliary video
      (such as depth maps) are carried in separate streams.

   To bind multiple video streams that carry a single stereoscopic 3D
   video, this document also extends the SDP grouping mechanism from
   [RFC5888].

3.  Definitions

   2D video
      Video that does not in itself contain depth or parallax
      information.

   auxiliary video
      A sequence of depth or parallax maps, which are used to add depth
      to 2D video.

   C-view
      The centre view: a visual entity as seen from a viewpoint between
      the left and right eyes.  The C-view can be used to calculate the
      L- and R-views.

   C-stream
      A 2D video stream consisting of a sequence of C-views.

   depth map
      A two dimensional map, each pixel of which defines the depth of
      one or more pixels in an associated 2D video frame.

   depth map stream
      An auxiliary stream, which contains a sequence of depth maps.  The
      depth map stream is synchronised with the associated 2D video
      stream.

   frame packing
      A format that packs the L- and R-views into a single 2D video
      stream.  The packing may be done spatially, where each video frame
      is divided into sub-frames, one containing the L-view and one
      containing the R-view.  The packing can also be done sequentially,
      where alternating video frames represent L- and R-views.

   L-view
      A visual entity that is to be projected to the left eye.

   L-stream
      A 2D video stream consisting of a sequence of L-views.

   parallax map
      A two dimensional map, each pixel of which defines the parallax of
      one or more pixels in an associated 2D video frame.

   parallax map stream
      An auxiliary stream, which contains a sequence of parallax maps.
      The parallax map stream is synchronised with the associated 2D
      video stream.

4.  The "3dFormat" attribute

   The media-level SDP attribute "3dFormat" signals the format of
   stereoscopic 3D video.  The attribute transfers this information
   through two parameters: one indicating the format type of the
   stereoscopic 3D video carried in the media stream(s), and the other
   indicating the type of the video component, which is a constituent
   element of the stereoscopic 3D video.  The video component type
   depends on the format type of the stereoscopic 3D video.  The syntax
   of the attribute is defined as follows:

                 a=3dFormat:<Format Type> <Component Type>

   The <Format Type> can have the following values (as indicated between
   the quotes):

   "FP"  Frame Packing
      The L- and R-views are packed into a single stream.  The packing
      may use a side-by-side, top-and-bottom, interleaved, checkerboard
      or frame sequential format.

   "SC"  Simulcast
      The L- and R-streams are transmitted separately.

   "2DA"  2D + auxiliary
      2D video and auxiliary data (such as depth maps or parallax maps)
      are transmitted.  These can be transmitted in a single stream, as
      well as in two separate streams.

   The <Component Type> can have the following values (as indicated
   between the quotes):

   "C"  Centre view
      The associated stream is a C-stream.

   "CD"  centre view and depth map
      The associated stream contains both the C-view and depth map
      sequences.

   "ChB"  Checkerboard
      The video frame consists of alternating pixels from the
      corresponding L- and R-views, as illustrated by Figure 1.

   "CP"  Centre view and parallax map
      The associated stream contains both the C-view and parallax map
      sequences.

Internet-Draft              Signal 3D format                  March 2011


   "D"  Depth map
      The associated stream is a sequence of depth maps.

   "L"  Left view
      The associated stream is the L-stream.

   "LD"  Left view and depth map
      The associated stream contains both the L-view and depth map
      sequences.

   "LIL"  Line Interleaved
      Each video frame consists of alternating scan lines from the L-
      and R-views.

   "LP"  Left view and parallax map
      The associated stream contains both the L-view and parallax map
      sequences.

   "P"  Parallax map
      The associated stream is a sequence of parallax maps.

   "R"  Right view
      The associated stream is the R-stream.

   "SbS"  Side by Side
      Each video frame is divided in two equally sized sub-frames,
      spatially positioned side by side of each other.  One sub-frame
      contains the L-view, whereas the other contains the R-view.

   "Seq"  Frame sequential
      The single video stream consists of alternating frames from the L-
      and R-streams.

   "TaB"  Top and Bottom
      Each video frame is divided in two equally sized sub-frames,
      spatially positioned above each other.  One sub-frame contains the
      L-view, whereas the other contains the R-view.

5.  Grouping

   When multiple streams carry a single stereoscopic 3D video, (e.g.
   C-stream and parallax map, or separately transmitted L- and
   R-streams), the grouping mechanism from [RFC5888] MUST be used.

   However, to cater for the special requirements of 3D signalling, the
   semantics are expanded:

    group-attribute     = "a=group:" semantics *(SP identification-tag)
    semantics           = "LS" / "FID" / "3DS" / semantics-extension
    semantics-extension = token

   The grouping is needed when multiple streams carry a single
   stereoscopic 3D video.  This is the case when the <format type> is
   "SC", or the <format type> is "2DA" and the 2D video and auxiliary
   data are transmitted as multiple streams.  A group with the "3Ds"
   semantics is called a "3DS group".

   A 3DS group MUST NOT contain data that is (potentially) inconsistent
   with other data in the 3DS group:

   o  A 3DS group MUST NOT contain both a parallax map stream and a
      depth map stream.

   o  A 3DS group MUST NOT contain more than one parallax map stream.

   o  A 3DS group MUST NOT contain more than one depth map stream.

   o  A 3DS group MUST contain at least one 2D video stream.

   o  If a 3GS group contains an L- and an R-stream, it MUST NOT contain
      a depth map or a parallax map.

   o  If a 3DS group contains only one 2D video stream, it MUST also
      contain a parallax map stream or a depth map stream.

   o  If a 3DS group contains a parallax map stream or a depth map
      stream, it MUST also contain a 2D video stream.

                      | Seq |  T |       |         |
                      |     |    |       |         |
                      | TaB |  T |       |         |
                      +-----+----+-------+---------+

   The table is to be read as follows:

   o  The columns indicate <Format Type> values, whereas the rows
      indicate <Component Type> values.

   o  For one particular column, we denote the <Format Type> value by
      "FT" and the <Component Type> value by "CT".

   o  When an entry in the table is empty, it means that the
      corresponding combination of FT and CT is not allowed.

   o  When an entry in the table contains a single <Component Type>
      value CTsec, it means that another stream with the <Component
      Type> value CTsec and the same <Format Type> value FT is needed.

   o  When multiple <Component Type> values are listed, separated by a
      "/" symbol, only one secondary stream is needed, which must have
      one of the listed <Component Type> values, and the same <Format
      Type> value FT.

   o  When an entry contains "3DS", it means that a 3DS group is needed.

   o  When an entry in the table contains the letter "T" (true), it
      means that the corresponding combination FT and CT is allowed,
      that there is no required secondary stream, and that a 3DS group
      is not needed.

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  "3dFormat" attribute

   Following the guidelines in [RFC4566], the SDP attribute has to be
   registered at IANA:

   o  Contact name/email: authors of this RFC

   o  Attribute name: 3dFormat

   o  Long-form attribute name: Attribute for signalling the format of a
      stereoscopic 3D video carried in the media stream(s).

   o  Type of attribute: media level

   o  Subject to charset: no

   The "3dFormat" SDP media-level attribute is used to signal the format
   of stereoscopic 3D video, carried in one or more media stream(s).

   The attribute has the following syntax:

                 a=3dFormat:<Format Type> <Component Type>

   The <Format Type> indicates the format type of the stereoscopic 3D
   video carried in the media stream(s).  It indicates whether the
   stereoscopic 3D video is frame packed, simulcast or consists of a 2D
   video stream and an auxiliary stream.  The <Format Type> can have the
   following values (as indicated between the quotes):

      "FP"     frame packed
      "SC"     simulcast
      "2DA"    2D + auxiliary

   The <Component Type> indicates the type of the video component, which
   is a constituent element of the stereoscopic 3D video.  It can have
   the following values:
