Abstract

   In NAT64 scenaires,sigle-point failure is a critical issue to
   restrict large-scale deployment.  In order to overcome this hurdle,
   this memo proposed a optimal load-balance mechanism for NAT64.
   Through the new-defined evaluation metrics, several extended ICMP
   messages combining with anycast are performed to achieve optimal
   NAT64 selection.  Meanwihle, the synchroniztion process of IP address
   mapping information is also designed to guarantee the service
   continuity.

1.  Introduction

   In NAT64[I-D.bagnulo-behave-nat64] scenaries, NAT64 gateway is a
   equipment to handle data translation functionalities between
   different IP families.  With the development of network scale, the
   data transmission volume will be increased rapidly.  Meanwhile, a
   more productive processing capabilities are required to implement IP
   address translation and application layer gateway processing.  Due to
   the unstable volume of data traffic, a single-point failure is easy
   to occur in the case of deploying a single gateway on IPv6 network
   border.

   In order to provide a reliable NAT handling, some redundancy
   mechanisms have been designed, such as cold standy and hot standy
   mechanism.  In addition,new routing mechanisms are also proposed to
   achieve load-balance between different NAT equipments.  Those methods
   could decrease the risks of single-point failures by separating data
   traffic into different NAT.  However,unbalanced traffic distributions
   could be happened when a specific destination has been trageted
   frequently.  For example, some popular websites always get high visit
   rating.

   In order to achieve the results of optimal load-balance, a dynamic
   load-balance mechanism is required based on NAT process load states.
   The optimum load-balance mechanism could dynamicaly direct data
   traffic into the NAT with light data traffic.  Therefore, the network
   resource could be allocated maximally.

   In the document, a optimal load-balance mechanism of NAT64 is
   proposed to realize optimized data traffic distribution based on
   anycast approach.  Depending on that, hosts located on IPv6 network
   could simply configure a specific anycast address to discover a
   proper NAT64.

2.  Optimum Load-balance Mechanism Overview

   Depending on the characteristics of anycast routing, the anycast
   mechanism was applied in many load-balance cases, such as DNS load-
   balance.  Anycast approach provides hosts with a specific anycast
   address, which represents a bundle of server with similar
   functionalities.  Based on the anycast routing rules, only a router
   with minimum hop to the source response the initiator.In another
   words, the load-balace mechanism based on anycast only treat the hop
   as a metrics.  Following this rules, unbalaced load distribution
   might be happend in local area, since data only routed to a specific
   router.

   The objectives of optimal load-balance mechanism are to discover
   apropriate NAT to translate IP address information.  Therefore, the
   selection of optimum NAT is an key issue for the load-balance
   mechanism.  Therein, two kinds of basic indicators are considerated
   to evaluate which NAT could be chosen to process data translation.
   Under the analysis of influence factors,load status of NAT and hop
   from hosts to NAT are defined.  The load status represents the
   utilization of NAT processor.  And hop could be counted from hosts to
   NAT by interim routers.  The combination of two indicators is used to
   determine data paths, throgh which data traffic si routed to a
   destination.

   Under effect of above defined metrics, the data traffic will be route
   to optimum NAT dynamically.  It could cause the uncertainty of NAT
   selection, since network environment will be changed over time.  When
   the traffic is directed to different NAT compared to previous one,
   the IP address mapping information is needed to guarantee transmited
   data could be tanslated.  Therefore, the IP address mapping should be
   synchronized betweent the different NAT so as to ensure the service
   continuities.  Otherwise, the data traffic will be lost due to the
   absence of mapping table.

   Figure 4: Optimal Load-balance Data Flow

   (1)IP address mapping infromation will be synchronized based on
   interaction of NAT anycast synchronization message. each NAT64 will
   send synchronization message to a NAT64 multicast address, which
   could guarantee each of them can receive the message and construct
   global NAT64 mapping table.  The synchronization actions will be
   performed by constant interval in order to update respective changes.

   (2)Host send a NAT anycast request message to a specific anycast
   address, which will identify a bundle of NAT64.

   (3)When a normal router receive the request message, they will update
   Hop field by plusing one and routed to next hop.

   (4)When the request message arrive the NAT64 with anycast address, it
   will extract hop field and combine with load status to determine
   whether it is optimal NAT64.

   (5)NAT64 sends NAT anycast response message with recommend NAT64 list
   to hosts.  And, the host will pick the optimal NAT64 unicast address
   to initiate application data flow.
