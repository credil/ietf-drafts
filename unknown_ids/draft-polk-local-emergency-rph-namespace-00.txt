1.  Introduction

   This document creates the new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 
   Resource Priority header field namespace "esnet" for local emergency
   usage and places this namespace in the IANA registry.  The SIP 
   Resource-Priority header field is defined in RFC 4412 [RFC4412]. 
   This new namespace is to be used within public safety answering 
   point  (PSAP) networks.  This new namespace can be used for inbound 
   calls towards PSAPs, between PSAPs, and between a PSAP and first 
   responders or their organizations.  

   Within controlled environments, such as an IMS infrastructure or 
   Emergency Services network (ESInet), where misuse can be reduced to 
   a minimum because these types of networks have great controls in 
   place, this namespace can be to provide an explicit priority 
   indication that facilitates differing treatment of emergency SIP 
   messages according to local policy, or more likely, a contractual 
   agreement between the network organizations.  This indication is 
   used solely to differentiate SIP requests, transactions or dialogs, 
   from other requests, transactions or dialogs that do not have the 
   need for priority treatment.  If there are differing, yet still 
   valid Resource-Priority header values between SIP requests in a 
   network, then this indication can be used by local policy to 
   determine which SIP request, transaction or dialog receives which 
   treatment (likely better or worse than another).

   It can also be imagined that Application Service Providers (ASP) 
   directly attached to an ESInet can have a trust relationship with

Internet-Draft SIP Resource-Priority for Local Emergencies     Oct 2010

   the ESInet such that within these networks, SIP requests (thereby 
   the session they establish) make use of this "esnet" namespace for 
   appropriate treatment.

   This document merely creates the namespace, per the rules within 
   [RFC4412], necessitating a Standards Track RFC for IANA registering 
   new RPH namespaces and their relative priority-value order.

   There is the possibility that within emergency services networks - 
   provided local policy supports enabling this function - a Multilevel
   Precedence and Preemption (MLPP)-like behavior can be achieved 
   (likely without the 'preemption' part, which will always be a matter
   of local policy, and defined here) - ensuring more important calls 
   are established or retained, the "esnet" namespace is given 5 
   priority-levels.  MLPP-like SIP signaling is not defined in this 
   document for 911/112/999 style emergency calling, but it is not 
   prevented either.

   Within the ESINet, there will be emergency calls requiring different
   treatments, according to the type of call.  Does a citizen's call to
   a PSAP require the same, a higher or a lower relative priority than 
   a PSAP's call to a police department, or the police chief?  What 
   about either relative to a call from within the ESINet to a 
   federal government's department of national security, such as the US
   Department of Homeland Security?  For this reason, the "esnet" 
   namespace is given multiple priority levels.

   This document does not define any of these behaviors, outside of 
   reminding readers that the rules of RFC 4412 apply - though examples
   of usage are included for completeness.  This document IANA 
   registers the "esnet" RPH namespace for use within emergency 
   services networks, not just of those from citizens to PSAPs.


2.  Rules of Usage of the Resource Priority Header field

   This document retains the behaviors of the SIP Resource Priority 
   header field, defined in [RFC4412], during the treatment options 
   surrounding this new "esnet" namespace. The usage of the "esnet" 
   namespace does not have a 'normal', or routine call level, given the
   environment this is to be used within (i.e., within an   ESInet).  
   That is for local jurisdictions to define within their respective 
   parts of the ESInet- which could be islands of local administration.

   RFC 4412 states that modifying the relative priority ordering or the
   number of priority-values to a registered namespace is not 
   recommended across the same administrative domain, due to 
   interoperability issues with dissimilar implementations. 

   Every use of this namespace will be in times of an emergency, where 
   at least one end of the signaling is within a local emergency 
   organization.

   The "esnet" namespace has 5 priority-values, in a specified relative 
   priority order, and is a queue-based treatment namespace [RFC4412]. 
   Individual jurisdictions MAY configure their SIP entities for 
   preemption treatment. This is OPTIONAL, subject to local policy 
   decisions.

   Conceivably, this could be an example network diagram where the 
   "esnet" namespace is used:

       Figure 1: Where 'esnet' Namespace Can or Will be used

   In Figure 1., the "esnet" namespace is intended for usage within the
   ESInet on the right side of the diagram.  How it is specifically 
   utilized is out of scope for this document, and left to local 
   jurisdictions to define.  Adjacent ASPs to the ESInet MAY have a

   trust relationship that includes allowing this/these neighboring 
   ASP(s) to use the "esnet" namespace to differentiate SIP requests 
   and dialogs within the ASP's network.  The exact mapping between the 
   internal and external sides of the edge proxy at the ESInet 
   boundaries is out of scope of this document.

   To be clear, specifically for the use of an edge proxy in any 
   network, because the "esnet" namespace is allowed to be modified or 
   deleted at the edge proxy of the ESInet does not allow any edge 
   proxy to modify or delete any other Resource-Priority namespace.  
   This document's target market is for the "esnet" namespace only.


3.  "esnet" Namespace Definition

   One thing to keep in mind for now is the fact that this namespace 
   is not to be considered just "EMERGENCY" because there are a lot of 
   different kinds of emergencies, some on a military scale ([RFC4412] 
   defines 3 of these), some on a national scale ([RFC4412] defines 2 
   of these), some on an international scale.  These types of 
   emergencies can also have their own namespaces, and although there 
   are 45 defined for other uses, more are possible - so the 
   911/112/999 style of public user emergency calling for police or 
   fire or ambulance (etc) does not have a monopoly on the word 
   "emergency".

   The namespace "esnet" has been chosen - roughly to stand for 
   "Emergency Services NETwork", as it is most recognizable as that of 
   citizen's call for help from a public authority type of 
   organization.  This namespace will also be used for communications 
   between emergency authorities, and MAY be used for emergency 
   authorities calling public citizens.  An example of the later is a 
   PSAP operator calling back someone who previously called 911/112/999
   and the communication was terminated before it - in the PSAP 
   operator's judgment - should have been.

   Here is an example of a Resource-Priority header field using the 
   "esnet" namespace:

      Resource-Priority: esnet.0

3.1.  Namespace Definition Rules and Guidelines

   This specification defines one unique namespace for emergency 
   calling scenarios, "esnet", constituting its registration with IANA. 
   This IANA registration contains the facets defined in Section 9 of 
   [RFC4412].  

3.2.  The "esnet" Namespace

   Per the rules of [RFC4412], each namespace has a finite set of 
   relative priority-value(s), listed (below) from lowest priority to 


Polk                     Expires April 11, 2011                [Page 5]
Internet-Draft SIP Resource-Priority for Local Emergencies     Oct 2010

   highest priority.  In an attempt to not limit this namespace's use 
   in the future, more than one priority-value is assigned to the 
   "esnet" namespace.  This document does NOT RECOMMEND which 
   priority-value is used where.  That is for another document to 
   specify.  This document does RECOMMEND the choice within a national 
   jurisdiction is coordinated by all sub-jurisdictions to maintain 
   uniform SIP behavior throughout an emergency calling system of that 
   country.

   The relative priority order for the "esnet" namespace is as follows:

      (lowest)  esnet.0
                esnet.1
                esnet.2
                esnet.3
      (highest) esnet.4

   The "esnet" namespace will be assigned into the priority queuing 
   algorithm (Section 4.5.2 of [RFC4412]) from the public user to the 
   PSAP.  This does not limit its usage to only the priority queue 
   algorithm; meaning the preemption algorithm is a policy decision for
   local jurisdictions.  This document is not RECOMMENDING this 
   usage, merely pointing out those behaviors is a matter of local 
   policy.

   The rules originated in RFC 4412 remain with regard to an RP actor, 
   who understands more than one namespace, MUST maintain its locally 
   significant relative priority order.


4.  IANA Considerations

4.1  IANA Resource-Priority Namespace Registration

   Within the "Resource-Priority Namespaces" of the sip-parameters 
   section of IANA (created by [RFC4412]), the following entries will 
   be added to this table:

                        Intended      New warn-   New resp.
   Namespace  Levels    Algorithm     code        code      Reference
   ---------  ------  --------------  ---------   --------- ---------
     esnet      5        queue           no          no     [This doc]


4.2  IANA Priority-Value Registrations

   Within the Resource-Priority Priority-values registry of the 
   sip-parameters section of IANA, the following (below) is to be added 
   to the table:

   Namespace: esnet
   Reference: (this document)

Internet-Draft SIP Resource-Priority for Local Emergencies     Oct 2010

   Priority-Values (least to greatest): "0", "1","2", "3", "4"


5.  Security Considerations

   The Security considerations that apply to RFC 4412 [RFC4412] apply 
   here.  

   The implications of using this namespace within the 
   Resource-Priority header field incorrectly can cause a large impact 
   on a network - given that this indication is to give preferential 
   treatment of marked traffic great preference within the network than
   other traffic.  This document does not indicate this marking is 
   intended for use by endpoints, yet protections need to be taken to 
   prevent granting preferential treatment to unauthorized users not 
   calling for emergency help.  

   A simple means of preventing this usage into an ESInet is to not 
   allow "esnet" marked traffic to get preferential treatment unless 
   the destination is towards the local/regional ESInet.  This is not a
   consideration for internetwork traffic within the ESInet, or 
   generated out of the ESInet.  911/112/999 type of calling is fairly 
   local in nature, with a finite number of URIs that are considered 
   valid.
