Abstract

   In order to fax over IP networks different methods can be used. In
   many countries fax are legal documents. What is the best way to
   deliver fax? What is the most reliable method?
   This document proposes a priority of transport method for fax over
   IP.

2.  Introduction

   In order to fax over IP networks different methods can be used. In
   many countries fax are legal documents. What is the best way to
   deliver fax? What is the most reliable method?
   This document proposes a priority of negotiation of transport method
   for fax over IP.
   The goal of this draft is offer the best assurance in fax delivery.
   The discussion is not focus on the efficiency of signaling voice
   protocols over IP networks.
   Traditionally, faxes uses TDM techniques with ensured synchronization
   throughout the network. This strict clocking allowed faxes to use
   complex audio techniques and high rates of throughput. Given the
   burst nature of packet based networks the clocking synchronization is
   not guaranteed so the transmission of facsimile can be problematic.
   There are three techniques for sending faxes over IP consisting of
   fax pass through, real-time fax relay and fax store and forward.


3.  Implementation and Operations

   The fax over IP transmission starts from the customer premises
   equipment e.g. ATA, POTS or PSTN gateway, fax server, etc.
   These devices must negotiate a facsimile method using this priority:

  1) CONSIDERATION and FIRST SELECTION
  
  ----------------------------------------
  | fax isn't an interactive application |
  ----------------------------------------
    |
    |  ----------------------------------------------
    -->| fax isn't a real time critical application |
       ----------------------------------------------
         |
         |  ------------------------------------------------------------
         -->| my first choice is Store and Forward fax on the Internet |
            ------------------------------------------------------------

  Note: Store and Forward faxing retry continuously until successful and
        offer never busy fax service.

                ------------------------------------------ 
                | if Store and Forward is not supported  |
                | or negotiated pass to second selection |
                ------------------------------------------

  2) SECOND SELECTION

  ----------------------------------
  | fax is a real time application |
  ----------------------------------
    |
    |  -------------------------------------
    -->| my choice is real time fax relay  |
       -------------------------------------
 

                 -------------------------------------- 
                 | if fax relay is not supported or   |
                 | negotiated pass to third selection |
                 --------------------------------------

  3) THIRD SELECTION

  -----------------------------------
  | last choice is fax pass-through |
  -----------------------------------


   Redundancy transmission techniques, error correction mode and
   variation of simple duration are not mentioned because the scope is
   adopt a rigid priority during negotiation of fax over IP method.
