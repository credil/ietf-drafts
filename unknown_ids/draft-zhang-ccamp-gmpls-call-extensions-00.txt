1. Introduction 

   The concept of a Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) 
   Call is introduced in [RFC4974]. A Call is an association between 
   endpoints and possibly between key transit points (such as network 
   boundaries) in support of an instance of a service. The requirements 
   of Calls and the RSVT-TE extensions in support of Calls are also 
   described in [RFC4974]. 

   A Call is usually established between end-points to verify polices 
   and authorization applied on these end-points. However, in a multi-
   domain environment, some key polices and authorization are usually

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE extensions to GMPLS Calls          March 2009 
    

   deployed on the corresponding domain border nodes (domain ingress or 
   egress nodes), so these border nodes are also involved in processing 
   the Call when the Call is going through these domains. These nodes 
   that process the Call are known as "Call Managers". 

   Although it is stated that the mechanisms proposed in [RFC4974] are 
   applicable to any environment (including multi-area), the "Call Path" 
   is determined hop-by-hop by each Call Manager in sequence along the 
   path of the Call. That is, each Call Manager forwards the Notify 
   message that is used to manage the Call to the next Call Manager 
   along the Call Path. The Notify messages are targeted at (i.e., carry 
   the IP address of) the next Call Manager, and the route that the 
   messages follow through the network to reach the next Call Manager is 
   not important. 

   However, it is desirable to allow the Call-initiator to determine the 
   Call Path and to signal it explicitly in some cases (especially in 
   the multi-domain case). 

   This document describes RSVP-TE signaling extensions to allow the 
   Call-initiator to identify the Call Path explicitly when transit Call 
   Managers (besides the Call-initiator and Call-terminator) are 
   involved in a Call. 

   Note that Call and Connection are separated in the signaling, and 
   Call procedures do not impact the Connection procedures, so this 
   document does not modify any Connection procedures defined in 
   [RFC3471], [RFC3473], [RFC4208], and other existing protocol family. 

2. Motivation 

   In some cases, it is desirable to set up a Call through not only the 
   Call-initiator and Call-terminator, but also some transit Call 
   Manager nodes (e.g., transit border domain nodes) to verify the 
   corresponding polices and authorization applied on these nodes. 

   For instance, in the multi-domain case as shown in Figure 1, there 
   are three interconnected domains. Nodes I, D11, and D12 are in Domain 
   1, and the nodes D11 and D12 are the border nodes. Nodes D21, D22, 
   D23, and D24 are the border nodes of Domain 2, and the internal nodes 
   of Domain 2 are not shown in the figure. Nodes D31, D32, and E are in 
   Domain 3, and the nodes D31 and D32 are the border nodes. 

   Policies and authorization are often applied in domain border nodes, 
   such as the nodes D11, D12, D21, D22, D23, D24, D31, and D32 in this 
   example. Therefore, in this case, when a Call between Call-initiator 
   (node I) and Call-terminator (node E) is going to be setup, the Call

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE extensions to GMPLS Calls          March 2009 
    

   should be processed in some domain border nodes (for example, the 
   nodes D11, D21, D23, D31 should process the Call when the Call Path 
   I-D11-D21-D23-D31-E is selected).  

   Note that in this case, there may be several alternative Call Paths 
   between Call-initiator and Call-terminator. For example, in the 
   Figure 1, the possible Call paths may be I-D11-D21-D23-D31-E or I-
   D12-D22-D24-D32-E, or some other path depending on the 
   interconnectivity across the domains.

   Note that how to determine the Call Path is out of the scope of this 
   document.  

   According to the Section 7.3.1 of [RFC 4974], it is already supported 
   that the third parties (i.e., non-end points such as External Call 
   Managers) are involved in the Call, but there is no mechanisms for 
   the Call-initiator to control the Call Path. The Call Path is 
   determined by each Call Manager in turn selecting the next Call 
   Manager on the path to the Call-terminator and forwarding the Notify 
   message that sets up the Call. 

   However, in the case of a multi-domain Call, commercial and policy 
   motivations normally play a role in selecting the Call Path. This 
   selection may be at a coarse level (for example, identifying which 
   domains should or should not be used), or may be at a finer level 
   (for example, identifying which Call Managers to use). Note that 
   there is no concept of specifying links or resources within the Call

   Path as the Call is an ordered association of Call Managers, and not 
   a data path in the network. 

   Therefore, it is desirable to allow full control for the Call-
   initiator, which means that the Call-initiator can identify the full 
   Call Path explicitly. Moreover, the management plane needs to be able 
   to identify the Call Path explicitly as an instruction to the Call-
   initiator. 

   This document defines protocol extensions that provide a solution for 
   these requirements. 

3. Solution 

   In order to identify the Call Path explicitly for the Call-initiator, 
   the CALL_EXPLICIT_ROUTE object (Call_ERO) is introduced. 

   The format of the Call_ERO is defined as follows: 

   Class = TBD (0bbbbbbb), C_Type = 1 

 
    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                                                               | 
   //                        (Subobjects)                         // 
   |                                                               | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   The format of the Call_ERO is the same as EXPLICIT_ROUTE object (ERO) 
   described in [RFC3209]. And the subobjects including IPv4 prefix, 
   IPv6 prefix, and autonomous system number defined in [RFC3209] could 
   be reused as subobjects of Call_ERO. 

   In inter-domain environment, it is possible to collect and 
   communicate information about the inter-domain links because the 
   domains usually don't share the Traffic Engineering (TE) information 
   between domains. So Call_RRO and its Link_Capability subobject are 
   introduced to record this information. 

   The format of the Call_RRO is defined as follows: 

   Class = TBD (11bbbbbb), C_Type = 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   The format of the Call_RRO is the same as RECORD_ROUTE object (RRO) 
   described in [RFC3209].  

   The subobjects of RRO including IPv4 address and IPv6 address defined 
   in [RFC3209] could be reused as subobjects of Call_RRO and the 
   formats of the subobjects for LINK_CAPABILITY object [RFC4974] 
   including type 1, type 2, type 4, type 64 and type 65 could be reused 
   as Link_Capability subobjects of Call_RRO (Note that the 
   corresponding types are redefined as type 3, type 4, type 5, type 64 
   and type 65).  

   The following subobjects are defined currently: 

      -  Type 1: IPv4 address subobject defined in Section 4.4.1.1 of 
                 [RFC3209]. 

      -  Type 2: IPv6 address subobject defined in Section 4.4.1.2 of 
                 [RFC3209]. 

      -  Type 3: the link local IPv4 address of a link or a numbered 
                 bundle using the format defined in [RFC3209]. 

      -  Type 4: the link local IPv6 address of a link or a numbered 
                 bundle using the format defined in [RFC3209]. 

      -  Type 5: the link local identifier of an unnumbered link or 
                 bundle using the format defined in [RFC3477]. 

      -  Type 64: the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth corresponding to this      
                  link or bundle (see [RFC4201]). 

      -  Type 65: the interface switching capability descriptor (see      
                  [RFC4202]) corresponding to this link or bundle (see 
                  also [RFC4201]).

   Similar to the Label RRO [RFC3209], the Link_Capability subobjects 
   are pushed onto the Call_RRO object prior to pushing on the IPv4 or 
   IPV6 subobject. A Call Manager MUST NOT push on a Link_Capability 
   subobject without also pushing on an IPv4 or IPv6 subobject. 

   Note that multiple Link_Capability subobjects following IPv4 or IPv6 
   subobject can be presented in the Call_RRO to collect all the 
   possible link information between domains. 

   The revised Notify message is as follows using the meta-language 
   described in [RBNF]: 

      <Notify message>  ::= <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ] 

                            [[ <MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK>]...]

4. Operations 

   The processes for the revised Notify message comply with the 
   procedures described in [RFC3974] except that the Call_ERO is 
   processed at the Call Managers. The processes for the Call_ERO and 
   Call_RRO are similar to the Connection ERO and RRO [RFC3209].  

   The procedures of Call Setup for the revised Notify message are 
   summarized as follows (other procedures are the same as [RFC3974]): 

   (1)The Call-initiator initiates Call setup and processes the Call 
      locally (e.g., verifies the policy, etc.). After that, it adds 
      the Call_ERO to the Notify message, including the sub-objects to 
      identify the Call Path. If Call_RRO is required, it also should 
      add Call_RRO to the Notify message. Then the Call-initiator sends 
      the Notify message to the first Call Manager indicated by the 
      first sub-object of the Call_ERO (Note that there is no Label 
      _Recording for Call_RRO). 

   (2)The transit Call Managers process the Call when they receive the 
      Notify messages. After that, they remove themselves from the 
      Call_ERO. If Call_RRO is presented in the Notify message, it 
      should also process Call_RRO similar to [RFC3209]. Then it sends 
      the Notify message to the next Call Manager identified by the 
      Call_ERO. 

   (3)Step 2 recurs until the Notify message gets to the Call-
      terminator. And the corresponding Notify message returns to Call-
      initiator in the inverse direction. 

   If, at any time, the Call_ERO is absent or present but empty (for 
   example, when a transit Call Manager removes itself from the 
   Call_ERO), a Call Manager MUST select a next Call Manager on the Call 
   Path toward the Call-terminator (identified in the Session object of 
   the Notify message). This next Call Manager may be another transit 
   Call Manager or may be the Call-terminator itself. The Call Manager 
   MAY create a new Call_ERO if none exists to define hops to the Call-
   terminator, or may add hops to the existing Call_ERO between itself 
   and the next hop in the received Call_ERO. Such actions are subject 
   to local policy. 

4.1. User-Initiated Calls 

   The extensions in this document can also be applied in user-initiated 
   calls, although the example described in this document is about 
   network-initiated Call. Note that, in this case, the first node 
   within the first network domain may be responsible for specifying the 
 
 
Zhang                 Expires September 01, 2009               [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE extensions to GMPLS Calls          March 2009 
    

   Call Path explicitly in the Notify message. The procedures should 
   comply with the description in the Section 7.2 of [RFC 4974]. 

5. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations about Call setup in single domain are 
   described in [RFC 4974]. In the case of multi-domain environment, the 
   security about Call is similar to that of Connection which is 
   described in [RFC 5151]. Therefore, please refer to the corresponding 
   Security Consideration sections in [RFC 4974] and [RFC 5151] to take 
   into account the security issues. 

6. Manageability Considerations 

   The mechanisms defined in this document call upon the use of policy 
   at Call Managers. Such policy SHOULD be available for configuration 
   by the operator either directly acting on the Call Manager or through 
   a policy server. Important information for the application of policy 
   is carried in the Call establishment messages (Notify messages) in 
   the Session, Session_Attributes, Sender_Template, Link_Capability, 
   and Policy_Data objects. 

   The mechanism used to determine the entire Call Path or next Call 
   Manager in a Call Path is beyond the scope of this document. One 
   solution is to allow configuration of the Call Path from the operator 
   as part of the service request (just as the explicit path of a label 
   switched path (LSP) can be specified by the operator). 

   Operators will expect to be able to inspect Call Managers and 
   determine for which Calls they are initiator, transit, or terminator. 
   Furthermore, they will expect to be able to inspect a Call at any 
   Call Manager that it uses, and determine all information about the 
   Call including its Call Path. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document introduces two new classes named Call_ERO and Call_RRO. 

7.1. Call_ERO Object  

   Class-Num = TBD (0bbbbbbb) 

   C-Type=1 (Call_ERO) 

   The Call_ERO object is only used for Call messages in Notify messages. 

   Subobjects of the Call_ERO object with C-Type 1:

             1       IPv4 prefix 

             2       IPv6 prefix 

            32       Autonomous system number 

7.2. Call_RRO Object  

   Class-Num = TBD (11bbbbbb) 

   C-Type=1 (Call_RRO) 

   The Call_RRO object is only used for Call messages in Notify messages. 

   The subobjects of Call_RRO are defined in Section 3 of this document. 

7.3. RSVP Error Codes and Error Values 

   The Call message (Notify message) should be rejected when any Call 
   Manager which receives the Call message including Call_ERO does not 
   recognize the Call_ERO. 

      o  Error Codes: 

         - Call Management (value 32) 

      o  Error Values: 

         - Call Management/Unknown Call_ERO      (value=TBD)
