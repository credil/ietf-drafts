       Alert-Info URNs for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
                  draft-ietf-salud-alert-info-urns-03

Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to
   provide a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the UA when
   the user is alerted.  This is done using the Alert-Info header field.
   However, the reference addresses only network resources with specific
   rendering properties.  There is currently no support for predefined
   standard identifiers for describing the semantics of the alerting
   situation or the characteristics of the alerting signal, without
   being tied to a particular rendering.  To overcome this limitation
   and support new applications, a new family of URNs for use in SIP
   Alert-Info header fields is defined in this specification.

   This document normatively updates [RFC3261], the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP).  It changes the usage of the SIP Alert-Info header
   field defined in the [RFC3261] by additionally allowing its use in
   all provisional responses to INVITE (except the 100 response).

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs               November 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] includes a means to
   suggest to a user agent (UA) a particular ringback tone or ring tone
   to be used during session establishment.  In [RFC3261] this is done
   by including a URI in the Alert-Info header field, that specifies the
   tone.  The URI is most commonly the HTTP URL to the audio file.  On
   the receipt of the Alert-Info header field the user agent may fetch
   the referenced ringback tone or ring tone and play it to the user.

   This mechanism hinders interoperability when there is no common
   understanding of the meaning of the referenced tone, which might be
   country- or vendor-specific.  It can lead to problems for the user
   trying to interpret the tone and for the UA wanting to substitute its
   own tone (e.g., in accordance with user preferences) or provide an
   alternative alerting mode (e.g., for hearing-impaired users).  If
   caller and callee are from different countries, the understanding of
   the tones may vary significantly.  Hearing impaired users may not
   sense the specific tone if it is provided as an audio file.  The tone
   per se is also not useful for automata.

   There are currently interoperability issues around the use of the
   Alert-Info header field when not using an external ring file.  For
   example, consider the PBX special ring tone for an external (to the
   PBX) caller.  Different vendors use different approaches such as:
   Alert-Info: <file://ring.pcm>;alert=normal where ring.pcm is a dummy
   file or: Alert-Info: <file://normal.ring.pcm> or: Alert-Info:
   <sip:normal-ringtone@example.com>.  As a result, Alert-Info currently
   only works when the same vendor provides proxy and UA, as only then
   is the same "fake" proprietary URI convention used.

   Another limitation of the current solution is that the referenced
   tones are tied to particular rendering.  It is not possible to
   provide semantic indications or names for rendering characteristics
   that signals the intent and allows the recipient to decide how to
   render the received information in an appropriate way.

   To solve the described issues, this specification defines the new URN
   namespace 'alert' for the Alert-Info header field that allows for
   programmatic user interface adaptation and for conversion of
   equivalent alerting tones in the Public Switched Telephone Network
   (PSTN) when the client is a gateway.  The work to standardize an
   Alert-Info URN will increase SIP interoperability for this header
   field by replacing proprietary conventions used today.

   Using the 'alert' namespace provides syntax for several different

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs               November 2011


   application spaces, e. g.:

   o  Names for service indications, such as call waiting or automatic
      callback, not tied to any particular rendering.

   o  Names for common ring tones generated by PBX phones for cases such
      as an internal enterprise caller, external caller, ringback tone
      after a transfer failure or expiration of a hold timer, etc.

   o  Names for country-specific ringback tones.

   o  Names for things with specific renderings that aren't purely
      audio.  They might be static icons, video sequences, text, etc.

   Some advantages of a URN rather than a URL of a downloadable
   resource:

   o  Do not need to download it or deal with security issues associated
      with dereferencing.

   o  No formatting or compatibility issues.

   o  No security risk of rendering something unexpected and
      undesirable.

   o  The tone can be stored locally in whatever format and at whatever
      quality level is appropriate, because it is specified "by name"
      rather than "by value".

   o  It is easier to make policy decisions about whether to use it or
      not.

   o  It facilitates translation for the hearing impaired.

   The downside is that if the recipient does not understand the URN
   then it will only be able to render a default ringback tone or ring
   tone.

   This document creates a new URN namespace and registry for alert
   indications and registers some initial values.

1.2.  Alert-Info Header Field Usage Change

   This specification changes the usage of the SIP Alert-Info header
   field defined in the [RFC3261] by additionally allowing its use in
   all provisional responses to INVITE (except the 100 response).

   In practice, this specification extends Alert-Info in that it will

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs               November 2011


   cause the use of a new class of URIs and the use of multiple URIs.
   Backward compatibility issues are not expected, as devices that do
   not understand an Alert-Info URN should ignore it, and devices should
   not malfunction upon receiving multiple Alert-Info alert-params
   (which was syntactically permitted before, but rarely used).

1.3.  Terminology

   This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles
   involved in the use of alerting indications in SIP.  A "specifier"
   sends an "alerting indication" (one or more URNs in an Alert-Info
   header) to a "renderer" which then "renders" a "signal" or
   "rendering" based on the indication to a human user.  A "category" is
   a characteristic whose "values" can be used to classify indications.

   This specification uses the terms "ring tone" and "ringback tone".  A
   "ring tone" or "calling signal" (terminology used in [E182]) is a
   signal generated by the callee's end device, advising the callee
   about an incoming call.  A "ringback tone" or "ringing tone"
   (terminology used in [E182]) is a signal advising the caller that a
   connection has been made and that a ring tone is being rendered to
   the callee.


2.  Requirements

   This section discusses the requirements for an alerting indication to
   transport the semantics of the alerting situation or the
   characteristics of the rendering.

   REQ-1: The mechanism will allow user agents (UAs) and proxies to
   provide in the Alert-Info header field an alerting indication which
   describes the semantics of the signaling situation or the
   characteristics of the rendering and allows the recipient to decide
   how to render the received information to the user.

   REQ-2: The mechanism will allow the alerting indication to be
   specified "by name" rather than "by value", to enable local policy
   decisions whether to use it or not.

   REQ-3: The mechanism will enable alerting indications to represent a
   wide variety of signals, which have many largely-orthogonal
   characteristics.

   REQ-4: has been deleted.  To avoid confusion, the number will not be
   reused.

   REQ-5: The mechanism will enable the set of alerting indications to



Liess, et al.             Expires May 18, 2012                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs               November 2011


   be able to support extensibility by a wide variety of organizations
   that are not coordinated with each other.  Extensions will be able
   to:

   - add further values to any existing category

   - add further categories that are orthogonal to existing categories

   - semantically subdivide the meaning provided by any existing
   indication

   REQ-6: The mechanism will be flexible, so new alerting indications
   can be defined in the future, when SIP-applications evolve.  E. g.
   Alert-Info URNs could identify specific media by name, such as
   "Beethoven's Fifth", and the end device could render some small part
   of it as a ring tone.

   REQ-7a: The mechanism will provide only an indication capability, not
   a negotiation capability.

   REQ-7b: The mechanism will not require an alerting indication to
   depend on context provided by a previous alerting indication in
   either direction.

   REQ-8: The mechanism will allow transmission in the Alert-Info header
   field of SIP INVITE requests and provisional 1xx responses excepting
   the 100 responses.

   REQ-9: The mechanism will be able to accommodate renderers that are
   customized with a limited or uncommon set of signals they can render
   and renderers that are provided with a set of signals that have
   uncommon semantics.  (The canonical example is a UA for the hearing-
   impaired, customized with an uncomon set of signals, video or text
   instead of audio.  By REQ-7, the renderer has no way of transmitting
   this fact to the specifier.)

   REQ-10: The mechanism will allow an alerting indication to reliably
   carry all extensions if the specifier and the renderer have designs
   that are properly coordinated.

   REQ-11: The mechanism will allow a renderer to select a tone that
   approximates to that intended by the specifier if the renderer is
   unable to provide the precise tone indicated.

   REQ-12: The mechanism will support alerting indications relating to
   services such as call waiting, forward, transfer-recall, auto-
   callback and hold-recall.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs               November 2011


   REQ-13: The mechanism will allow rendering common PBX ring tone
   types.

   REQ-14: The mechanism will allow rendering specific country ringback
   tones.

   REQ-15: The mechanism will allow rendering tones for emergency
   alerts.  (Use cases and values definition are not subject of this
   specification.)

   REQ-16: The mechanism will allow rendering using other means than
   tones, e.g. text or images.

   REQ-17: The mechanism will allow TDM gateways to map ring/ringback
   tones from legacy protocols to SIP at the edge of a network, e.g.
   national ring tones as defined in TIA/EIA-41-D and 3GPP2 A.S0014.
   (Use cases and values definition are not subject of this
   specification.)

   REQ-18: The mechanism will ensure that if an UA receives Alert-Info
   URNs or portions of an Alert-Info URN it does not understand, it can
   ignore them.

   REQ-19: The mechanism will allow storage of the actual encoding of
   the rendering locally rather than fetching it.

   REQ-20: The mechanism must provide a simple way to combine two
   alerting indications to produce an alerting indication that requests
   a combination of the intentions of the two alerting indications,
   where any contradictions or conflicts between the two alerting
   indications are resolved in favor of the intention of the first
   alerting indication.


3.  Use Cases

   This section describes some use cases for which the Alert-Info URN
   mechanism is needed today.

3.1.  PBX Ring Tones

   This section defines some commonly encountered ring tones on PBX or
   business phones.  They are as follows:

3.1.1.  normal

   This tone indicates that the default or normal ring tone should be
   rendered.  This is essentially a no-operation Alert-Info URN and



Liess, et al.             Expires May 18, 2012                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs               November 2011


   should be treated by the UA as if no Alert-Info URN is present.  This
   is most useful when Alert-Info header field parameters are being
   used.  For example, in [I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances], an Alert-
   Info header field needs to be present containing the "appearance"
   parameter, but no special ring tone needs to be specified.

3.1.2.  external

   This tone is used to indicate that the caller is external to the
   enterprise or PBX system.  This could be a call from the PSTN or from
   a SIP trunk.

3.1.3.  internal

   This tone is used to indicate that the caller is internal to the
   enterprise or PBX system.  The call could have been originated from
   another user on this PBX or on another PBX within the enterprise.

3.1.4.  priority

   A PBX tone needs to indicate that a priority level alert should be
   applied for the type of alerting specified (e.g. internal alerting).

3.1.5.  short

   In this case the alerting type specified (e.g. internal alerting)
   should be rendered shorter than normal.  In contact centers, this is
   sometimes referred to as "abbreviated ringing" or a "zip tone".

3.1.6.  delayed

   In this case the alerting type specified should be rendered after a
   short delay.  In some bridged line/shared line appearance
   implementations, this is used so that the bridged line does not ring
   at exactly the same time as the main line, but is delayed a few
   seconds.

3.2.  Service Tones

   These tones are used to indicate specific PBX and public network
   telephony services.

3.2.1.  call-waiting

   The Call Waiting Service [TS24.615] permits a callee to be notified
   of an incoming call while the callee is engaged in an active or held
   call.  Subsequently, the callee can either accept, reject, or ignore
   the incoming call.  There is an interest on the caller side to be



Liess, et al.             Expires May 18, 2012                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs               November 2011


   informed about the call waiting situation on the callee side.  Having
   this information the caller can decide whether to continue waiting
   for callee to pickup or better to call some time later when it is
   estimated that the callee could have finished the ongoing
   conversation.  To provide this information, the callee's UAS ( or
   proxy) aware of the call waiting condition can add the call-waiting
   indication to the Alert-Info header field in the 180 Ringing
   response.  As call-waiting information may be subject to the callee's
   privacy concerns, the exposure of this information shall be done only
   if explicitly required by the user.

3.2.2.  forward

   This feature is used in a 180 Ringing response when a call forwarding
   feature has been initiated on an INVITE.  Many PBX system implement a
   forwarding "beep" followed by normal ringing to indicate this.  Note
   that a 181 response can be used in place of this URN.

3.2.3.  transfer-recall

   This feature is used when a blind transfer [RFC5589] has been
   performed by a server on behalf of the transferor and fails.  Instead
   of failing the call, the server calls back the transferor, giving
   them another chance to transfer or otherwise deal with the call.
   This service tone is used to distinguish this INVITE from any other
   normal incoming call.

3.2.4.  auto-callback

   This feature is used when a user has utilized a server to implement
   an automatic callback service.  When the user is available, the
   server calls back the user and utilizes this service tone to
   distinguish this from any other normal incoming call.

3.2.5.  hold-recall

   This feature is used when a server implements a call hold timer on
   behalf of an endpoint.  After a certain period of time of being on
   hold, the user who placed the call on hold is alerted to either
   retrieve the call or otherwise dispose of the call.  This service
   tone is used to distinguish this case from any other normal incoming
   call.

3.3.  Country-specific ringback tone indications for the public

   In the PSTN, different tones are used in different countries.  End
   users are accustomed to hear the callee's country ringback tone and

4.  Namespace Registration Template

   This section describes the registration template for the 'alert' URN
   namespace identifier (NID) according to the [RFC2141] and [RFC3406]

   Namespace ID:  alert

   Registration Information:



      Registration version:  1

      Registration date:  TBD

   Declared registrant of the namespace:



      Registering organization:  IETF

      Designated contact:  Laura Liess

      Designated contact email:  l.liess@telekom.de

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the "alert" URNs is called
      alert-identifier and has a hierarchical structure.  The left-most
      label is called "alert-category" and is separated from the right-
      side of the alert-identifier, the alert-indication, by a colon.
      The general form is urn:alert:{alert-category}:{alert-indication}.

      In this specification, following alert-categories identifiers are
      described: "service" , "priority" , "source" , "duration", "delay"
      and "locale".  The alert-category set can be extended in the
      future.

      The categories are orthogonal.  Any Alert-Info URN defined in this
      specification is syntactically valid for ring and ringback tones
      and can be used in INVITE requests or in provisional 1xx responses
      excepting the 100 response.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs               November 2011


      The alert-indications are hierarchical identifiers, consisting of
      one label or a sequence of labels separated by colons.  The set of
      allowable characters is the same as that for domain names
      [RFC1123].  Labels are case-insensitive, but MUST be specified in
      all lower-case.





      The ABNF [RFC5234] for the Alert -Info URNs is shown below:



        alert-URN       = "URN:alert:" alert-identifier
        alert-identifier= alert-category ":" alert-indication
        alert-category  = name
        alert-indication= name *(":" name)
        name = let-dig [ *let-dig-hyp let-dig ]
        let-dig-hyp     = let-dig / "-"
        let-dig         = ALPHA / DIGIT
        ALPHA           = %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z
        DIGIT           = %x30-39 ; 0-9


   Relevant ancillary documentation:  None

   Community considerations:  The alert URN is believed to be relevant
      to a large cross-section of Internet users, including both
      technical and non-technical users, on a variety of devices and
      with a variety of perception capabilities.  The 'alert' URN will
      allow Internet users to receive more information and enable them
      to better make decisions about accepting an offered call, or get
      better feedback on the progress of a call they have made.  User
      interfaces for the perception impaired users can better render the
      ringback tone indication based on the Alert-Info URN.  The
      assignment of identifiers is described in Section 10.  The Alert-
      Info URN does not prescribe a particular resolution mechanism, but
      it is assumed that a number of different entities could operate
      and offer such mechanisms.

   Namespace considerations:  There do not appear to be other URN
      namespaces that serve the same need of uniquely identifying
      'alert' communication and information services.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:  An Alert-Info URN identifies a
      logical service or tone, specified in the alert-indication
      registration (see Section 10).  Resolution of the registered URN
      will return a particular instance of the alert identifier.  Alert
      identifier URNs MUST be unique for each unique indication; this is
      guaranteed through the registration of each alert indication
      within this namespace, described in Section 10.

   Identifier persistence considerations:  The Alert-Info URN for the
      same indication is expected to be persistent, as long as it is
      registered with IANA.

   Process of identifier assignment:  The process of identifier
      assignment is described in Section 10.

   Process for identifier resolution:  'Alert-Info URNs are statically
      resolved according to the IANA registry.

   Rules for lexical equivalence:  Alert-Info URNs are compared
      according to case-insensitive string equality.

   Conformance with URN syntax:  The BNF in the 'Declaration of
      syntactic structure' above constrains the syntax for this URN
      scheme.

   Validation mechanism:  Validation determines whether a given string
      is currently a validly-assigned URN [RFC3406].  Static validation
      is performed based on the currently registered Alert-Info URNs at
      IANA.

   Scope:  The scope for this URN is public and global.


5.  Alert-Info URN Values Definitions

5.1.  Alert-category Values Definitions

   Following alert-category values are defined in this document:

   - service

   - source

   - priority

   - duration

   - delay

   - locale

5.2.  Alert-indication Values Definitions

   This section describes the Alert-Info URN indication values for the
   alert-categories defined in this document.

   For each alert-category, a default indication is defined, which is
   essentially a no-operation Alert-Info URN and should be treated by
   the UA as if no Alert-Info URN for the respective category is
   present.  Alert-Info URN default indications are most useful when
   Alert-Info header field parameters are being used.  For example, in
   [I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances], an Alert-Info header field needs
   to be present containing the "appearance" parameter, but no special
   ringtone need be specified.

   The "<private-name>" syntax is used for extensions specific to
   independent organizations, as described in Section Section 6.2.

5.2.1.  Alert-Info URN Indication Values for the alert-category
        'service'

   - normal (default)

   - call-waiting

   - forward

   - recall:callback

   - recall:hold

   - recall:transfer

   - <private-name>

   Examples: urn:alert:service:call-waiting or
   urn:alert:service:recall:transfer.

5.2.2.  Alert-Info URN Indication Values for the alert-category 'source'

   - unclassified (default)

   - internal

   - external

   - friend

   - family

   - <private-name>

   Examples: urn:alert:source:external.

5.2.3.  Alert-Info URN Indication Values for the alert-category
        'priority'

   - normal (default)

   - low

   - high

   - <private-name>

   Examples: urn:alert:priority:high.

5.2.4.  Alert-Info URN Indication  Values for the alert-category
        'duration'

   - normal (default)

   - short

   - long

   - <private-name>

   Examples: urn:alert:duration:short.

5.2.5.  Alert-Info URN Indication Values for the alert-category 'delay'

   - none (default)

   - yes

   - <private-name>

   Examples: urn:alert:delay:yes .

5.2.6.  Alert-Info URN Indication Values for the alert-category 'locale'

   - default (default)

   - country:<ISO 3166-1 country code>

   - <private-name>

   The ISO 3166-1 country code [ISO3166-1] is used to inform the UA on
   the other side of the call that a country-specific rendering should
   be used.  For example, to indicate ringback tones from South Africa,
   the following URN would be used: <urn:alert:locale:country:za>.


6.  Extensibility Rules

6.1.  General Extensibility Rules

   The set of Alert-Info URNs is intended to be extensible.  An
   extension "at the top level" creates an entirely new category (or
   characteristic), an extension "at the second level" creates a new
   indication value for a category, an extension "at the third level"
   creates a subdivision of a indication value, etc.  Extensions at
   lower levels are preferred over those at upper levels.

   URNs allow in principle infinite subdivision of existing indication
   values, although most of the standard Alert-Info URNs give only one
   level of subdivision and a few give two levels of subdivision.

   The process for defining new Alert-Info URNs is described in section
   Section 10.1.  Adding new categories and adding alert-indication
   values other than via the "private" mechanism described above is
   standards action.

6.2.  Extensions Rules for Independent Organizations

   The "<private-name>" syntax is for proprietary extensions specific to
   independent organizations.  The "<private-name>" is used in the form
   of a "reverse FQDN" of the entity that defines the extension,
   possibly followed by further components.  Standard URNs will never
   contain a ".", so proprietary extensions need no further marker.
   This gives a way of assigning unique names without the need for a new
   registry.  The namespace for each alert category is independent.
   Those assigning new names must ensure they are in a position to



Liess, et al.             Expires May 18, 2012                 [Page 17]

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs               November 2011


   assign names uniquely for the FQDN they choose.

   For example, Avaya could use
   urn:alert:service:call-waiting:avaya.com, which is the Avaya private
   version for call-waiting or it may have several distinct private
   versions of call-waiting, e.g.
   urn:alert:service:call-waiting:abc.avaya.com and
   urn:alert:service:call-waiting:def.avaya.com (which are siblings in
   the tree under urn:alert:service:call-waiting).  Also it can
   subdivide its private version of call-waiting in
   urn:alert:service:call-waiting:avaya.com:abc and
   urn:alert:service:call-waiting:avaya.com:def (which are siblings in
   the tree under service:call-waiting:avaya.com).

   Adding new categories and adding alert-indication values via the
   "private" mechanism is not a standards action.


7.  Combinations of Alert-Info URNs and Priority Rules

   This section describes combination rules for the case when all the
   Alert-Info header fields only contain Alert-Info URNs.  Combinations
   of URNs and URIs in the Alert-Info header fields of the same SIP-
   message are not defined in this specification.

   In many cases, more than one URNs will be needed to fully define a
   particular tone.  This is done by including multiple Alert-Info URNs,
   in one or more Alert-Info header fields in a request or a response.
   For example, an internal, priority call could be indicated by Alert-
   Info: <urn:alert:source:internal>, <urn:alert:priority:high>.  A
   priority call waiting tone could be indicated by Alert-Info:
   <urn:alert:service:call-waiting>, <urn:alert:priority:high>.

   The sender of the Alert-Info header may include an arbitrary list of
   Alert-Info URNs, even if they are redundant or contradictory.  An
   earlier URN has priority over any later contradictory URN.  This
   allows any element to modify a list of URNs to require a feature
   value (by adding a URN at the beginning of the list) or to suggest a
   feature value (by adding a URN at the end of the list).

   The receiving UA attempts to match the received Alert-Info URNs
   combination with the signal(s) it is able to render.

   The implementation is free to ignore any or all parts of the received
   Alert-Info URNs.  The exact way in which a UA renders a received
   combination of Alert-Info URNs is left as an implementation issue.
   However, the implementation MUST comply to following rules:




Liess, et al.             Expires May 18, 2012                 [Page 18]

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs               November 2011


      a.  Each alert-info URN has precedence over all URNs that follow
      it, and its interpretation is subordinate to all URNs that precede
      it.

      b.  If the UA cannot implement the effect of a URN (because it
      does not recognize the URN or the URN's effect is precluded by
      preceding URNs), the UA removes the final name of the URN
      repeatedly until either (1) the resulting URN is recognized and
      can be given effect by some signal (without reducing the degree of
      expression of any preceding URN), or (2) the resulting URN is
      reduced to having no names.  In case (2), that URN in the series
      cannot be given effect, so it is ignored.

      c.  In case that after processing all the URNs, the UA can
      generate more than one signal that are equally effective at
      expressing the URNs (under the preceding rules), one of those
      signals is selected.  When selecting from the set of equally
      effective signals, any particular signal is preferred over all
      signals that are more specific (in regard to the defined meaning
      of the signal to the user) than that particular signal.  (E.g., if
      each signal expresses a set of alert-indications (values) for a
      set of alert-categories (per the BNF), then a first signal is more
      specific than a second signal if the second signal's alert-
      indications are (partial or complete) initial portions of the
      first signal's corresponding alert-indications.)

   The following text is a non-normative example for a possible
   implementation.

   For each category, there is a tree of possible values.  For this
   description, we will name each tree by the category name, and name
   each node by the trailing portion of the URN.  Each URN thus
   corresponds to a node in a category tree.  Thus, there is a tree
   named "source", whose root node is also named "source", and which has
   the children source:internal, source:external, source:friend, and
   source:family.  For example, urn:alert:source:external is placed at
   the node "source:external" in the "source" tree.  (Of course, there
   are an infinite number of potential additional nodes in the tree for
   private values, but we don't have to represent those nodes explicitly
   unless the device has a signal representing the private value.)

   We assign similar locations to signals, but each signal has a place
   in *every* tree.  If a signal has a simple meaning, such as "external
   source", its place in the "source" tree is source:external, but its
   place in every other feature tree is at the root node, meaning that
   it has no particular meaning for that feature.

   A signal that has a complex meaning may have non-root positions in



Liess, et al.             Expires May 18, 2012                 [Page 19]

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs               November 2011


   more than one feature tree.  For example, an "external, high
   priority" signal would be placed at source:external and priority:high
   in those trees, but be at the root in all other feature trees.

   In order to assure that the algorithm always selects at least one
   signal, we assume that there is a "default" signal, whose position in
   every feature tree is at the root.  The default signal is set up so
   that it will never be excluded from the set of acceptable signals for
   an indication, but will usually be the least-desirable signal for any
   indication.

   The algorithm proceeds by considering each URN in the received Alert-
   Info header from left to right, while revising a set of signals.  The
   set of signals starts as the entire set of signals available to the
   device.  Each URN excludes some signals from the set, and *sorts* the
   signals that remain in the set according to how well they represent
   the URN.  The first URN is the "major sort", and has the most
   influence on the position of a signal in the set.  The second URN is
   a "minor sort", in that it arranges the orders of the signals that
   are tied within the first sort, the third URN arranges the orders of
   the signals that are tied within the first two sorts, etc.

   At the end of the algorithm, a final, "most minor" sort is done,
   which orders the signals which have been tied under all the sorts
   driven by the URNs.  This sort places the least specific signal
   *first*.

   Once all the URNs are processed and the sorting is done, the device
   selects the first signal in the set.

   Here is how a single sort step proceeds, examining a single URN to
   modify the set of signals (by excluding some signals and further
   sorting the signals that remain):

   o  The URN is at a specific node in a specific category tree.

   o  All signals in the set positioned at that node, or an ancestor
      node of the URN are kept; all other signals are removed from the
      set.

   o  Within any group of signals that are tied under previous sorts,
      place first those which are at the node of the URN, place second
      those which are at the parent node of the URN, etc., and place
      last those which are at the root node of the feature tree.

8.  User Agent Behaviour

   Upon receiving a SIP INVITE request or a SIP provisional response
   with an Alert-Info header field that contains a combination of Alert-
   Info URNs, the User Agent (UA) attempts to match the received Alert-
   Info URNs combination with a signal it can render.  The mandatory
   rules and an algorythm example are described in Section Section 7.
   The User Agent (UA) ignores the Alert-Info URNs for which no match is
   found and proceeds with the normal operation.

   The User Agent (UA) is responsible for the non disturbing rendering
   if multiple indications and network resources are to be rendered
   simultaneously.


9.  Proxy Behaviour

   A SIP proxy MAY add a URN or multiple URNs to the Alert-Info header
   field in a SIP request or a provisional 1xx response excepting 100
   response when it needs to provide additional information about the
   call or about the provided service.  A SIP Proxy SHOULD NOT add a
   mixture of Alert-Info URNs and URIs to the Alert-Info header field
   that may cause disturbing rendering interference at the recipient's
   User Agent (UA).

   Following example shows both the network audio resource referenced by
   the HTTP URI and the URN indication for the call-waiting service
   transported by the Alert-Info header field in a 180 Ringing
   provisional response.

      Alert-Info: <http://www.example.com/sound/moo.wav>,
       <urn:alert:service:call-waiting>


10.  IANA Considerations

   This section registers a new URN namespace identifier (NID) in
   accordance with RFC 3406 with the registration template provided in
   Section 4 .

10.1.  New alert identifiers

   Alert URN identifiers are identified by labels managed by IANA,
   according to the processes outlined in [RFC5226] in a new registry
   called "Alert URN Labels".  Thus, creating a new Alert-Info URN
   identifier requires IANA action.  The policy for adding a new alert
   category is 'Standards Action'.  (This document defines the alert
   categories 'service', 'source', 'priority', 'duration', 'delay' and



Liess, et al.             Expires May 18, 2012                 [Page 21]

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs               November 2011


   'locale'. ) The policy for assigning labels to alert-indications and
   the rules to combine them may differ for each alert-category and MUST
   be defined by the document describing the corresponding alert
   category.  The entries in the registration table have the following
   format:


      alert-category/      Reference    Description
      alert-identifier
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
      foo                  RFCxyz       Description of the 'foo'

      foo:bar              RFCabc       Description of the 'foo:bar'
                                        alert-identifier


   Each alert-category or alert-indication label MUST NOT exceed 27
   characters.

10.2.  Initial IANA Registration

10.2.1.   The "service" alert-category and alert-identifiers

   The following table contains the initial IANA registration for the
   "service" alert-category and alert-identifiers.  The value of this

11.  Internationalization Considerations

   The alert-identifier labels are protocol elements [RFC6365] and are
   not normally seen by users.  Thus, the character set for these
   elements is restricted, as described in Section 10.


12.  Security Considerations

   As an identifier, the alert URN does not appear to raise any
   particular security issues.  The indications described by the 'alert'
   URN are meant to be well-known, so privacy considerations do not
   apply to the URN.

   Provision of the specific indications from callee to caller may raise
   privacy issues.  Such provision SHALL always be explicitly authorised
   by the callee.

   Proxies may choose to suppress undesired indications from untrusted
   callers while allowing them from trusted callers.


13.  Acknowledgements

   The authors wish to thank Denis Alexeitsev, the editor of the initial
   draft in BLISS, Anwar Siddiqui for his contributions to the draft,
   and Adam Roach, Dean Willis, Martin Huelsemann, Shida Schubert, John
   Elwell and Tom Taylor for their comments and suggestions.
