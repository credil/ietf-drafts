    <abstract>
      <t>This document requests a reserved IANA IPv4 address allocation as
      Shared Transition Space to support the deployment of IPv4 address
      sharing technologies post IPv4 exhaustion.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Many operators are currently implimenting their IPv6 transition
      plans. During the transition, continued support for heritage IPv4 only
      devices will be required. While most operators are well aware of the
      limitations of NAT444 <xref target="I-D.shirasaki-nat444"></xref>, it is
      the transition mechnism that has the least customer impact for many
      carriers.</t>

      <t>To deal with some of the NAT444 limitations, it becomes necessary for
      a provider to utilize address space in the NAT444 infrastructure that
      will not conflict with it's customer space.</t>

      <t>This document requests that IANA reserve a portion of the remaining
      unallocated space as Shared Transition Space for the enablement of a
      clean transition strategy in provider networks.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Motivation">
      <t>The Internet community is rapidly consuming the remaining supply of
      unallocated IPv4 addresses. During the transition period to IPv6, it is
      imperative that Service Providers maintain IPv4 service for devices and
      networks that are currently incapable of upgrading to IPv6.</t>

      <t>In order to provide IPv4 service to customers and/or devices once the
      IPv4 address space is exhausted, Service Providers must multiplex
      several subscribers behind a single IPv4 address using one of several
      techniques including NAT444 . Providers need sufficient non-<xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref> address space to deploy such technologies and
      avoid overlap with customer use of private address space.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Shared Transition Space">
      <t>This document proposes the assignment of the equivalent of a /10 as
      Shared Transition Space. This block MAY be composed of one contiguous
      assignment, or several discontiguous assignments. Shared Transition
      Space is IPv4 address space reserved for Infrastructure provider use
      with the purpose of facilitating IPv6 transition and IPv4 coexistence
      deployment. The requested block SHOULD NOT be utilized for any purpose
      other than IPv4 to IPv6 transition infrastructure. Network equipment
      manufacturers MUST NOT use the assigned block in default or example
      device configurations.</t>

      <t>Because Shared Transition addresses have no meaning outside of the
      Infrastructure Provider, routing information about shared transition
      space networks MUST NOT be propagated on IInterdomain links, and packets
      with shared transition source or destination addresses SHOULD NOT be
      forwarded across such links. Internet service providers SHOULD filter
      out routing information about shared transition space networks on
      ingress links.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This memo does not define any protocol, and raises no security
      issues. Any addresses allocated as Shared Transition Space would not be
      routable on the Internet.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is asked to reserve an IPv4 /10 from its remaining pool of
      unallocated IPv4 addresses for use as Shared Transition Space.</t>
