    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Designing a routing protocol in Low power and Lossy link Networks
      (LLNs) imposes great challenges, mainly due to low data rates, high
      probability of packet delivery failure, and strict energy constraint in
      nodes. The IETF ROLL Working Group has specified the Routing Protocol
      for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref>.</t>

      <t>RPL is designed to meet the core requirements specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs"></xref>,<xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs"></xref>,<xref target="RFC5873"> </xref> and <xref target="RFC5548"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document&rsquo;s contribution is to provide several routing
      performance metrics of RPL using a decrete event simulator in various
      real-life deployment scenarios. Each result has been checked against
      several real-life deployed networks. </t>

      <t>Simulation results are purely indicative since they may vary
      according to the discrete event simulator used to perform the
      simulations, the choice of the RPL parameter and so on. Still this
      document provides valuable inputs and the specific context in which
      these simulations were performed are explicitly indicated.</t>

      <t>Several routing metrics are evaluated in this document:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Path quality metrics;</t>

          <t>Control plane overhead;</t>

          <t>End to End delay between nodes;</t>

          <t>Ability to cope with unstable situations (link churns, node
          dying);</t>

          <t>Required resource constraints on nodes (routing table size,
          etc.).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Feedback from the ROLL Working Group are welcome to add new
      evaluation metrics of potential interest in further revisions of this
      document.</t>

      <t>Although simulation cannot prove formally that a protocol operates
      properly in all situations, it could give a good level of confidence in
      protocol behavior in highly stressful conditions, if and only if real
      life data are used. Simulation is particularly useful especially when
      theoretical model assumptions may not be applicable to such networks and 
      scenarios. Therefore, real deployed network data traces have been used to 
      model link behaviors.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Method">
      <t>RPL was simulated using OMNET++ <xref target="OMNETpp"></xref>, a
      well-known discrete event based simulator written in C++ and NED.
      Castalia-2.2 <xref target="Castalia-2.2"></xref> has been used as
      Wireless Sensor Network Simulator framework within OMNET++. The output
      and events in the simulating are visualized with the help of the Network
      AniMator or NAM, which is distributed with NS (Network Simulator)<xref target="NS-2">.</xref></t>

      <t>Note that NS or any of its versions were not used in this simulation
      study. Only the visualization tool was borrowed for verification
      purposes. As noted, real link layer data gathered from networks deployed
      on the field were used to compute the PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) for
      each of the links in the network. By contrast with theoretical models
      (e.g. Markov Chains) which may have assumptions not applicable to lossy
      links, real-life data has been used for two aspects of the
      simulations:</t>

      <t>* Link failure model: Time varying real network traces containing
      packet delivery probability for each link and over all channels for both
      indoor network deployment and outdoor network deployment were used.
      Thus, different types of link characteristics are used in the study.</t>

      <t>* Topology: The topologies are gathered from real-life deployment
      (traces mentioned above) as opposed to random topology simulations.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Simulation Setup ">
      <t>A 45 node topology, deployed as an outdoor network, shown in Figure 1, 
      and a 2442 node topology, gathered from a deployment of smart meter 
      network, was used in the simulations.</t>

      <figure>
        <preamble></preamble>

        <postamble>Figure 1: Network topology for preliminary simulation
        results.</postamble>
      </figure>

      <t></t>

      <t>Note that this is just a start to validate the simulation before
      using large scale networks.</t>

      <t>A database of time varying link quality data, gathered from real
      network deployment, was created. Each link in the topology randomly
      'picks up' the same link model from the database corresponding to  real 
      model in deployment, and the link&rsquo;s Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) 
      varies according to the gathered data. Figure 2 shows some typical 
      temporal characteristics of some links in the network for the indoor 
      network trace used in the simulations. Packets are dropped randomly from 
      that link with probability (1 - PDR). Each link has a PDR that varies with
       time (in the simulation, the new PDR is read from the database every 10 
       minutes). Each time a packet is about to be sent, the module generates a 
       random number using the Mersenne Twister Random number generation method.
        The random number is compared to the PDR to determine whether the packet
         should be dropped or not. Note that each link use a different random 
         number generator to maintain true randomness in the simulator, and to 
         avoid correlation between links. Also, the packet drop applies to all 
         kinds of data and control packets (RPL) such as the DIO, DAO, DIS 
         packets defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref>.</t>

        <postamble>Figure 2: Example of link characteristics.</postamble>
      </figure>

      <t>In simulating RPL, the LBR first initiates sending out DIO messages,
      and the DAG is gradually constructed. The trickle time interval for
      emitting DIO message assumes the initial value of 1 second, and then
      changes over simulation time as mentioned in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref>.</t>

      <t>RPL makes use of trickle timers: I_min is initially set to 1 second
      and I_doubling is equal to 16, so that maximum time between two
      consecutive DIO emissions by a node (under a steady network condition)
      is 18.2 hours. Another objective of this study is to give insight to the
      network administrator on how to tweak the trickle values. These
      recommendations could then be used in applicability statement documents.
      Further revision of this document will include simulations for large
      scale networks with varied parameters and show how quickly the network
      will stabilize, comparing data/control traffic and studying the trade off
      between reactivity and lifetime.</t>

      <t>Each node in the network, other than the LBR, also emits DAO messages
      as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref>, to initially
      populate the routing tables with the prefixes received from children via
      the DAO messages in support of the Point to Point (P2P) and Point to
      Multipoint traffic (P2MP) in the "down" direction. In this revision of
      the document, it is assumed that each node is capable of storing route
      information for other nodes in the network. In further revision of this
      document nodes without storage capability will be added to the network
      to see the influence of extra states on the nodes and the additional
      control plane overhead to propagate the route records thanks to Reverse
      Route Stacks in the DAO messages.</t>

      <t>For nodes implementing RPL, as expected, the routing table memory
      requirement varies according to the position in the DAG. The worst-case
      assumption that there is no route summarization in the network is made.
      Thus a node closer to the DAG will have to store more routing entries.
      Further revision of this document will explore the influence of
      performing route summarization along the DAG, which could be performed
      thanks to a newly defined Objective Function or new address provisioning
      techniques. It is also assumed that all nodes have equal memory capacity
      to store the routing states, therefore no source routing is
      required.</t>

      <t>For Simulation of the indoor network, each node sends traffic according
       to a Constant Bit Rate (CBR) to all other nodes in the network over the 
       simulation period. To simulate a more realistic scenario, 20% of the 
       generated packets by each node are destined to the root, and the 
       remaining 80% of the packets are uniformly assigned as destined to nodes
       other than the root. Therefore the root receives a considerably larger 
       amount of data than other nodes. These values may be revised when 
       studying the P2P traffic so as to have a majority of traffic going to 
       all nodes as opposed to the root. In the later part of the simulation, a
       typical home/building routing scenario was also simulated and different
       path quality metrics were computed for that traffic pattern.</t>

      <t>The packets are routed through the DAG built by RPL according to the
      mechanisms specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Since RPL is an IP routing protocol, no assumption is made on the
      link layer, thus potential gains in terms of header compression provided
      by 6loWPAN is not under consideration <xref target="draft-iphc"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A number of RPL parameters are used (such as Packet Rate from each
      source, Time Period of the LBR emitting new DAG Sequence Number) to
      observe their effect on the RPL performance metric of interest.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Metrics to evaluate RPL">
      <section title="Common Assumptions">
        <t>As the DAO messages are used to feed the routing tables in the 
        network, rthey grow with time and size of the network. However, we did 
        not pose any constraint on the size of this table, and how much 
        information the node can store.Currently, the routing table size is not 
        expressed in terms of Kbyte of memory usage but measured in terms of 
        number of entries for each node. Each entry has next hop node and path 
        cost associated with the destination node. In further revision of this 
        document, a single full 128-bit address per leaf plus a few bits to 
        store other information and flags will be used.</t>

        <t>The link ETX (Expected Transmission Count) metric is used to build 
        the DAG as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics"></xref>. 
        Further revisions of this document will include other metrics and 
        constraints such as the Hop count.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Path Quality">
        <t>Number of Hops: For each pair of source and destination, the
        average number of hops for both RPL and shortest path routing is
        computed. Shortest path routing refers to an hypothetical ideal
        routing protocol that would always provide the shortest path in term
        of path cost ETX (or whichever metric is used) in the network. The
        Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of hop distance for all paths
        (which is equal to n*(n-1) in an n node network) in the network with
        respect to number of hops is plotted in Figure 3 for both RPL and
        shortest path routing. One can observe that the CDF corresponding to 4
        hops is around 80% for RPL and 90% for shortest path routing. In other
        words, for the given topology, 90% of paths will have path length of 4
        hops or less with an ideal shortest path routing methodology, whereas
        in RPL Point-to-Point (P2P) routing, 90% of paths will have a length
        shorter or equal to 5 hops. This result shows that despite having a
        non optimized P2P routing scheme, the path quality of RPL is not much
        worse than an optimized one for the topology in consideration. Another
        reason may be, the sink is at the center of the network, so routing
        through the sink is often close to an optimal (shortest path) routing.
        This result may be different in a topology where the sink is located
        at one end of the network.</t>

          hops.</postamble>
        </figure>

        <t>Path Cost ETX: When optimizing the path using the link ETX metric,
        the path cost ETX along the path is computed for each pair. Figure 4
        shows the CDF of the total number of ETX to deliver a packet from a
        source to any destination node with respect to path cost ETX of the
        path from each source to each destination in the network, for both
        RPL, and shortest path routing. Here also one observes that path cost
        ETX along the path from all source to all destination is close to that
        of a shortest path routing for the network in the simulation.</t>

          value.</postamble>
        </figure>

        <t>Path Stretch: In this simulation, the path stretch is also
        calculated for each packet that traversed the network. The path
        stretch is determined as the difference between the number of hops
        taken by a packet while following a route built via RPL and the number
        of hops taken by shortest path routing (by using link ETX as the 
        metric). Once again, the CDF of path stretch is plotted against the 
        value of path stretch for different packets in Figures 5 and 6 for hop
        count stretch and ETX metric stretch respectively.</t>

      <section title="Routing Table Size">
        <t>The objective of this metric is to observe the distribution of the
        number of entries per node. Figure 7 shows the CDF of required number
        of routing table entries for all nodes. One can see, that 90% of the
        nodes need to store less than 10 entries in their routing cache.</t>

      <section title="Delay bound for P2P Routing">
        <t>For delay sensitive applications, such as home and building
        routing, etc., it is also important to limit the end-to-end delay.
        Figure 8 shows the upper bound and distributions of delay in Point to
        Point (P2P) routing between any two given nodes when RPL is employed
        for different hop counts between source and destination. Here, the hop
        count refers to the hop distance when RPL is employed and not shortest
        path distance between two nodes. Each packet has a length of 127
        bytes, with a 240 kbps radio, which makes the transmission time to be
        approximately 4 ms.</t>

      <section title="Control Packet Overhead">
        <t>The control plane overhead is an important routing metric in Low
        power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). Indeed, it is imperative to bound the
        control plane overhead. One of the distinctive characteristics of RPL
        is that it makes use of trickle timers so as to reduce the number of
        control plane packets by eliminating redundant messages. The aim of
        this metric is thus to analyse the control plane overhead in stable
        condition (no network element failure overhead) and in the presence of
        failures.</t>

        <t>Data and control plane traffic comparison for each node: Figure 9
        shows the comparison of the amount of data packets transmitted
        (including forwarded) and control packets (DIO and DAO messages)
        transmitted for each node when minimizing ETX is used by the OCP along
        the DAG. Here one can observe that considerable amount of traffic is
        routed through the sink itself. And also the fact that the amount of
        control traffic is really negligible in the protocol is reinforced. As
        expected, the nodes closer to sink and that act as forwarders handle
        much more data traffic than other nodes. The leaf nodes have
        comparable amount of data and control packet transmission, as they do
        not take part in routing the data.</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[Figure 9]]></artwork>

          <postamble>Figure 9: Amount of data and control packets transmitted
          for each node when minimizing ETX is used OCP along the
          DAG.</postamble>
        </figure>

        <t>Data and Control Packet Transmission with respect to time: In
        Figures 10, 11 and 12, the amount of data and control packets
        transmitted for node 12 (low rank in DAG, closer to the root), node 43 
        (in the middle) and node 31 (leaf node)are shown, respectively. These 
        values stand for number of packets transmitted for each 10 minutes 
        intervals, to help understand what is the density of data and control 
        packet exchange in the network. One can observe as the node is closer to
        the sink, the amount of data is larger, and the amount of control 
        traffic is negligible in comparison to the data traffic. Also, the 
        variation in data traffic is much larger for a node closer to sink, 
        because the destination of the packets varies over time, and 20% of the 
        packets are destined to sink only. For the nodes that are further away 
        from sink, the variation in data traffic becomes lesser, and the amount 
        of data traffic is also smaller.</t>

        <t>The control traffic for the nodes has a wave-like pattern. The
        amount of control packets for each node drops quickly as the DAG
        stabilizes due to the effect of trickle timer. However, as a new DAG
        Sequence is advertised, the trickle timers are reset and the nodes
        start emitting DIO frequently again to stabilize the DAG. One can see,
        for a node closer to sink, the data packet amount is much higher than
        control packet, and somewhat oscillatory around a mean value. The
        control packet amount exhibits a 'saw-tooth' behavior, mainly because
        as the ETX link metric was used, and as when PDR changes, the ETX path
        cost for a child node to its parent changes, which results in changing
        DAG rank of the child. This event resets the trickle timer and emit
        new DIO. Also, issue of a new DAG Sequence Number triggers DAG
        recomputation and resets the trickle timers. Therefore, one can
        observe that the number of control packets attains a high value for
        one interval, and the amount comes down to lower values for subsequent
        intervals. Also, for leaf nodes the amount of control packets are more
        than data packets, as leaf nodes are more prone to face changes in
        their DAG rank as opposed to nodes closer to sink when the link ETX
        value in the topology changes dynamically.</t>

      <section title="Loss of connectivity">
        <t>Upon link failures, a node may loose his parents: preferred and
        backup (if any) and its sibling (if any). In this case, if a packet
        has to be sent and the routing table does not contain an entry for the
        corresponding destination the packet is dropped. RPL proposes two
        mechanism for DAG repairs, known as global repair and local repair. In
        this version of the document, simulation results are presented to
        evaluate the amount of time packets are lost because of loss of
        connectivity for two cases: a) when only global repair mechanism is
        implemented (i.e. periodic emission of new DAG SequenceNumbers by the
        DODAG root), and b) when poisoning the sub-DAG is used in case of
        unreachability of any parent or sibling node to forward data along
        with global repair mechanism. The idea is to tune the frequency at
        which new DAG Sequence Numbers are generated by the DAG root that are
        used for global repair, and also to observe the effect of the same
        when local repair is used in conjunction. It is expected that a higher
        frequency will lead to shorter duration of connectivity loss at a
        price of a higher rate of control packet in the network. For local
        repair, the simulation results show the trade-off in amount of time
        that a node may remain without service and total number of control
        packets for extra bit of signalling.</t>

        <t>Figure 13 shows the CDF of time spent by any node without any
        service, when the packet rate from the sources is a packet each 10
        seconds, and new DAG Sequence Number is issued every 10 minutes. This
        plot reflects the property of global repair without any Local Repair
        scheme. When all the parents (and siblings) are temporarily
        unreachable from a node, the time before it hears a DIO from another
        node is recorded, which gives the time without service. In some cases,
        this value might go up to the DAG Repair Timer value, because until a
        DIO is heard, there is a lack of connectivity.</t>

        <t>The effect of the DAG Repair Timer on time without service is
        plotted in Figure 14, where the source rate is 20 seconds/packet and
        in Figure 15, where the source sends a packet every 10 seconds.</t>

        <t>Figure 16 shows effect of DAG Global Repair Timer period on control
        traffic. As expected, as the frequency at which new DAGSequenceNumber
        are generated increases, the amount of control traffic also decreases
        because the trickle interval gets larger for each node, which is
        pretty intuitive. However this smaller amount of control traffic comes
        at a price of increased time for loss of connectivity.</t>

        <t>The effect of the DAG Repair Timer on time without service, when
        Local repair is present, is plotted in Figure 17, where the source
        rate is 20 seconds/packet. A comparison of the CDF of loss of
        connectivity for Global Repair Mechanism and Global + Local Repair
        Mechanism is shown in Figures 18 and 19 (semilog plots), where the
        source generates a packet every 10 seconds and 20 seconds
        respectively. In the plots, one can observe that using the method of
        poisoning the sub-DAG greatly reduces the time without
        connectivity.</t>

    <section title="RPL in a building routing scenario">
      <t>Unlike the previous traffic pattern, where a majority of the total
      traffic generated by any node is destined to the root, this section
      considers a different traffic pattern, which is more prominent in home
      or building routing scenario. A node sends 60% of its total generated
      traffic to its physically 1-hop distant nodes, 20% of traffic to its
      2-hop distant nodes. Rest of the traffic is once again distributed among 
      all other nodes in the network. The CDF of average hop distance path 
      stretch in terms of hop distance, ETX path cost and delay for P2P routing 
      for all pair of nodes is calculated. Maintaining low delay bound for P2P 
      traffic is of high importance in this traffic scenario, as the 
      applications in  home  and building routing has typically low delay 
      tolerance.</t>

      <section title="Path Quality">
        <t>Figure 21 shows the CDF of number of hops for both RPL and ideal
        shortest path routing for the traffic scenario described above. Figure
        22 shows CDF of the expected number of transmission count for each
        packet to reach destination. Figures 23 and 24 show CDF of the stretch
        factor for these two metrics.</t>

        RPL is considered. Figure 25 shows how the end-to-end packet latency
        is distributed for different packets with different hop counts in the
        network.</t>

     <section title="RPL in a Large Scale Network">     
       <t>In this section we focus on analyzing how RPL operate in a large 
       networks by focusing on a few metrics: the latency and path cost stretch 
       for performance and the amount of control packet for scalability. we 
       simulate RPL in a 2442 node smart meter network to observe the effect as 
       the network size grow larger. We also use the corresponding gathered link
        traces to simulate packet drop pattern in the network. In this 
       simulation, each node sends traffic according to a Constant Bit Rate 
       (CBR) to the sink in the network over the simulation period. To simulate
       a more realistic scenario for a smart meter network, all 100% of the 
       generated packets by each node are destined to the root, and no traffic 
       is generated for nodes other than the root.</t>       
          
       <section title="Path Quality">
        <t>To show RPL scales with size of the network, we showWe show the 
        Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of ETX path cost for RPL in a 
        large scale smart meter network and we compare it to an hypothetical 
        ideal shortest path routing protocol which minimizes the total ETX count
        over the path (Figure 26). Also, in this simulation, the path stretch is
         also calculated for each packet that traversed the network. The path 
        stretch is determined as the difference between the number of Expected 
        Transmission (ETX Metric) taken by a packet while following a route 
        built via RPL and the same metric taken by shortest path routing 
        (by using link ETX as the metric). Here, the CDF of fractional path 
        stretch, which is path stretch value over the path cost of an Ideal 
        shortest path is plotted in Figure 27. The same fractional path stretch 
        value for hop distance is shown in Figure 28.</t>

        <t>Figure 30 shows the comparison of the amount of data packets 
        transmitted (including forwarded) and control packets (DIO and DAO 
        messages) transmitted for each node when minimizing ETX is used as the 
        link metric to optimize the DAG. Here one can observe that in spite of 
        the large scale of the network, amount of control traffic is really 
        negligible in the protocol in comparison to data packet transmission. 
        Also, as expected, we can observe from Figures 31, 32, 33 that the nodes
         closer to sink and that act as routers have much more data packet 
        transmission than other nodes. The leaf nodes have comparable amount of 
        data and control packet transmission, as they do not take part in 
        routing the data. As seen before, The data traffic for a child node has 
        much lesser variation than the nodes which are closer to the sink. This 
        variation decreases with increase in DAG depth.</t>
