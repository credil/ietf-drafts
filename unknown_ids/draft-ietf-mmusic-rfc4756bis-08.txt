   Forward Error Correction Grouping Semantics in Session Description
                                Protocol
                    draft-ietf-mmusic-rfc4756bis-08

Abstract

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) supports grouping media lines.
   SDP also has semantics defined for grouping the associated source and
   Forward Error Correction (FEC)-based repair flows.  However, the
   semantics that were defined in RFC 4756 generally fail to provide the
   specific grouping relationships between the source and repair flows
   when there is more than one source and/or repair flow in the same
   group.  Furthermore, the existing semantics do not support describing
   additive repair flows.  This document addresses these issues by
   introducing new FEC grouping semantics.  Synchronization Source
   (SSRC)-level grouping semantics are also introduced in this document
   for Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams using SSRC
   multiplexing.

Internet-Draft        FEC Grouping Semantics in SDP           April 2010


1.  Introduction

   Any application that needs a reliable transmission over an unreliable
   packet network has to cope with packet losses.  Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) is an effective approach that improves the
   reliabilty of the transmission particularly in multicast and
   broadcast applications where the feedback from the receiver(s) is
   potentially limited.

   In a nutshell, FEC groups source packets into blocks and applies
   protection to generate a desired number of repair packets.  These
   repair packets may be sent on demand or independently of any receiver
   feedback.  The choice depends on the FEC scheme, the packet loss
   characteristics of the underlying network, the transport scheme
   (e.g., unicast, multicast and broadcast) and the application.  At the
   receiver side, lost packets can be recovered by erasure decoding
   provided that a sufficient number of source and repair packets have
   been received.

   For example, one of the most basic FEC schemes is the parity codes,
   where an exclusive OR (XOR) operation is applied to a group of
   packets (i.e., source block) to generate a single repair packet.  At
   the receiver side, this scheme provides a full recovery if only one
   packet is lost within the source block and the repair packet is
   received.  There are various other ways of generating repair packets,
   possibly with different loss-recovery capabilities.

   The FEC Framework [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] outlines a general
   framework for using FEC codes in multimedia applications that stream
   audio, video or other types of multimedia content.  The FEC Framework
   specification states that source and repair packets must be carried
   in different streams, which are referred to as the source and repair
   flows, respectively.  At the receiver side, the receivers should know
   which flows are the source flows and which flows are the repair
   flows.  The receivers should also know the exact association of the
   source and repair flows so that they can use the correct data to
   repair the original content in case there is a packet loss.
   Currently, SDP [RFC4566] uses [RFC3388] and [RFC4756] for this
   purpose.

   In order to provide applications more flexibility, the FEC Framework
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] allows a source flow to be protected by
   multiple FEC schemes, each of which requires an instance of the FEC
   Framework.  Thus, multiple instances of the FEC Framework may exist
   at the sender and the receiver(s).  Furthermore, within a single FEC
   Framework instance, multiple source flows may be grouped and
   protected by one or more repair flows.

Internet-Draft        FEC Grouping Semantics in SDP           April 2010


   The FEC Framework requires the source and repair packets to be
   carried in different streams.  When Real-time Transport Protocol
   (RTP) [RFC3550] is used to carry the source and repair streams, the
   FEC Framework recommends that each stream is carried in its own RTP
   session.  This provides flexibility in using FEC in a backward-
   compatible manner.  However, in some scenarios, a single RTP session
   may be desired to carry multiple RTP streams via Synchronization
   Source (SSRC) multiplexing in order to reduce the port usage.  For
   such scenarios, appropriate grouping semantics are also required.

   A basic example scenario is shown in Figure 1.  Here, source flow S1
   is protected by repair flow R1.  Also, source flows S1 and S2 are
   grouped and protected together by repair flow R2.

               SOURCE FLOWS             | FEC FRAMEWORK INSTANCE #1
             | S1: Source Flow |--------| R1: Repair Flow
         +---|
         |   | S2: Source Flow
         |
         +______________________________| FEC FRAMEWORK INSTANCE #2
                                        | R2: Repair Flow

   Figure 1: Example scenario with two FEC Framework instances where R1
            protects S1, and R2 protects the group of S1 and S2

   Grouping source flows before applying FEC protection may allow us to
   achieve a better coding performance.  As a typical scenario, suppose
   that source flows S1 and S2 in Figure 1 correspond to the base and
   enhancement layers in a layered video content, respectively.  Repair
   flow R2 protects the combination of the base and enhancement layers
   for the receivers who receive both layers, and repair flow R1
   protects the base layer only, for the receivers who want the base
   layer only, or who receive both layers but prefer FEC protection for
   the base layer only due to a bandwidth and/or any other limitation.

   The grouping semantics defined in this document offer the flexibility
   to determine how source streams are grouped together prior to
   applying FEC protection.  However, not all FEC schemes may support
   the full range of the possible scenarios (e.g., when the source
   streams carry different top-level media types such as audio and
   video).

   Using multiple FEC Framework instances for a single source flow
   provides flexibility to the receivers.  An example scenario is
   sketched in Figure 2.  Different instances may offer repair flows
   that are generated by different FEC schemes, and receivers choose to
   receive the appropriate repair flow(s) that they can support and
   decode.  Alternatively, different instances (whether they use the

   same FEC scheme or not) may use larger and smaller source block
   sizes, which accommodate the receivers that have looser and tighter
   latency requirements, respectively.  In addition, different instances
   may also provide FEC protection at different redundancy levels.  This
   is particularly useful in multicast scenarios where different
   receivers may experience different packet loss rates and each
   receiver can choose the repair flow that is tailored to its needs.

           SOURCE FLOWS              | FEC FRAMEWORK INSTANCE #1
           S3: Source Flow |---------| R3: Repair Flow
                           |
                           |---------| FEC FRAMEWORK INSTANCE #2
                                     | R4: Repair Flow

     Figure 2: Example scenario with two FEC Framework instances, each
       with a single repair flow protecting the same source flow S3

   In summary, based on the FEC Framework [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework],
   the SDP grouping semantics for FEC must support the ability to
   indicate that:

   1.  A given source flow is protected by multiple different FEC
       schemes.

   2.  Multiple repair flows are associated with a given FEC scheme.

   3.  Multiple source flows are grouped prior to applying FEC
       protection.

   4.  One or more repair flows protect a group of source flows.


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements and Changes from RFC 4756

3.1.  Source and Repair Flow Associations

   The FEC grouping semantics and 'group' attribute defined in this
   document and [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc3388bis], respectively, are used to
   associate source and repair flows.  This document also specifies how
   the 'group' attribute [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc3388bis] in SDP is used to
   group multiple repair flows with one or more source flows.

Internet-Draft        FEC Grouping Semantics in SDP           April 2010


   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc3388bis] obsoletes [RFC3388] to allow an "m" line
   identified by its 'mid' attribute to appear in more than one
   "a=group" line using the same semantics.  With this change and other
   required changes in the grouping semantics for FEC, a sender is
   allowed to indicate the specific associations between the source and
   repair flows, and a receiver can determine which repair flow(s)
   protect which source flow(s).

   This document introduces the changes required in the FEC grouping
   semantics and obsoletes [RFC4756].  New implementations SHOULD use
   the new semantics introduced in Section 4.2 and Section 4.4 of this
   document whenever possible, but they may need to use the obsoleted
   semantics given in Section 4.1 when backward compatibility is
   desired, as described in Section 4.5.

3.2.  Support for Additivity

   The FEC Framework also supports additive repair flows.  Additivity
   among the repair flows means that multiple repair flows may be
   decoded jointly to improve the recovery chances of the missing
   packets in a single or the same set of source flows.  Additive repair
   flows can be generated by the same FEC scheme or different FEC
   schemes.

   For example, in Figure 3, repair flows R5 and R6 may be additive
   within the FEC Framework instance #1.  Alternatively, all three
   repair flows R5, R6 and R7 could be additive, too.

           SOURCE FLOWS              | FEC FRAMEWORK INSTANCE #1
           S4: Source Flow |---------| R5: Repair Flow
                           |         | R6: Repair Flow
                           |
                           |---------| FEC FRAMEWORK INSTANCE #2
                                     | R7: Repair Flow

    Figure 3: Example scenario with two FEC Framework instances, where
    two repair flows in the first instance and a single repair flow in
            the second instance protect the same source flow S4


4.  FEC Grouping

4.1.  Old "FEC" Grouping Semantics

   The old "FEC" grouping semantics had been introduced in [RFC4756],
   and were based on [RFC3388].  The "FEC" semantics used the "a=group"
   line to form an FEC Group to indicate the association relationship
   between the source and repair flows.



Begen                   Expires October 30, 2010                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        FEC Grouping Semantics in SDP           April 2010


   In the "FEC" semantics, a source or repair flow could only appear in
   a single "a=group:FEC" line.  Thus, all the source and repair flows
   that are somehow related to each other have to be listed in the same
   "a=group:FEC" line.  For example, for the scenario sketched in
   Figure 1, we must write "a=group:FEC S1 S2 R1 R2" regardless of which
   repair flows protect which particular source flows.  Similarly, for
   the scenario sketched in Figure 3, we must write "a=group:FEC S4 R5
   R6 R7" regardless of which repair flows are additive.

   In certain simple scenarios such as where there is one source flow or
   one repair flow, these limitations will not be a concern.  In
   scenarios where using the "FEC" grouping semantics will provide an
   exact association among the source and repair flows and will not
   create any ambiguity, the "FEC" semantics can be safely used when
   backward compatibility is essential.

4.2.  New "FEC-FR" Grouping Semantics

   Each "a=group" line is used to indicate an association relationship
   between the source and repair flows.  The flows included in one
   "a=group" line are called an FEC Group.  If there is more than one
   repair flow included in an FEC group, they MUST be considered to be
   additive.  Repair flows that are not additive MUST be indicated in
   separate FEC groups.  However, if two (or more) repair flows are
   additive in an FEC group, it does not necessarily mean that these
   repair flows will also be additive in any other FEC group.
   Generally, in order to express multiple relations between the source
   and repair flows, each source and repair flow MAY appear in more than
   one FEC group.

   By extending [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc3388bis] we define "FEC-FR" as the
   new grouping semantics that can support the features of the FEC
   Framework.

   The "a=group:FEC-FR" semantics MUST always be used to associate the
   source and repair flows except when the source and repair flows are
   specified in the same media description, i.e., in the same "m" line.
   Note that additivity is not necessarily a transitive relationship.
   Thus, each set of additive repair flows MUST be stated explicitly.

4.3.  SDP Example

   For the scenario sketched in Figure 1, we need to write the following
   SDP:

        t=0 0
        a=group:FEC-FR S1 R1
        a=group:FEC-FR S1 S2 R2

        c=IN IP4 233.252.0.1/127
        a=rtpmap:100 MP2T/90000
        a=mid:S1
        m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 101
        c=IN IP4 233.252.0.2/127
        a=rtpmap:101 MP2T/90000
        a=mid:S2
        m=application 30000 RTP/AVP 110
        c=IN IP4 233.252.0.3/127
        a=rtpmap:110 1d-interleaved-parityfec/90000
        a=fmtp:110 L=5; D=10; repair-window=200000
        a=mid:R1
        m=application 30000 RTP/AVP 111
        c=IN IP4 233.252.0.4/127
        a=rtpmap:111 1d-interleaved-parityfec/90000
        a=fmtp:111 L=10; D=10; repair-window=400000
        a=mid:R2

   In this example, the source and repair flows are carried in their own
   RTP sessions and the grouping is achieved through the "a=group:
   FEC-FR" lines.

   For the additivity issues, let us consider the scenario sketched in
   Figure 3.  Suppose that repair flows R5 and R6 are additive but
   repair flow R7 is not additive with any of the other repair flows.
   In this case, we must write

        a=group:FEC-FR S4 R5 R6
        a=group:FEC-FR S4 R7

   If none of the repair flows is additive, we must write

        a=group:FEC-FR S4 R5
        a=group:FEC-FR S4 R6
        a=group:FEC-FR S4 R7

4.4.  Grouping for SSRC-Multiplexed RTP Streams

   [RFC5576] defines a grouping attribute, called 'ssrc-group', for the
   RTP streams that are SSRC multiplexed and carried in the same RTP
   session.  The grouping is based on the Synchronization Source (SSRC)



Begen                   Expires October 30, 2010                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        FEC Grouping Semantics in SDP           April 2010


   identifiers.  Since SSRC-multiplexed RTP streams are defined in the
   same "m" line, the 'group' attribute cannot be used.

   This document extends [RFC5576] in two ways.  First, we define how
   FEC is applied to source and repair flows for SSRC-multiplexed
   streams using the 'ssrc-group' attribute.  We then specify how the
   additivity of the repair flows is expressed for the SSRC-multiplexed
   streams.

   Per [RFC3550], the SSRC identifiers for the RTP streams that are
   carried in the same RTP session MUST be unique.  However, the SSRC
   identifiers are not guaranteed to be unique among different RTP
   sessions.  Thus, the 'ssrc-group' attribute MUST only be used at the
   media level [RFC5576].  The semantics of "FEC-FR" for the 'ssrc-
   group' attribute are exactly the same as the one defined for the
   'group' attribute.

   Let us consider the following scenario where there are two source
   flows (e.g., one video and one audio) and a single repair flow that
   protects only one of the source flows (e.g., video).  Suppose that
   all these flows are separate RTP streams that are SSRC multiplexed in
   the same RTP session.

                  SOURCE FLOWS             | FEC FRAMEWORK INSTANCE #1
                  S5: Source Flow |--------| R8: Repair Flow
                  S6: Source Flow

    Figure 4: Example scenario with one FEC Framework instance, where a
         single repair flow protects only one of the source flows

   The following SDP describes the scenario sketched in Figure 4.

        a=ssrc-group:FEC-FR 1000 2110
        a=mid:Group1

   Note that in actual use, SSRC values, which are random 32-bit
   numbers, may be much larger than the ones shown in this example.
   Also note that before receiving an RTP packet for each stream, the
   receiver cannot know which SSRC identifier is associated with which
   payload type.

   The additivity of the repair flows is handled in the same way as
   described in Section 4.3.  In other words, the repair flows that are
   included in an "a=ssrc-group" line MUST be additive.  Repair flows
   that are not additive MUST be indicated in separate "a=ssrc-group"
   lines.

4.5.  SDP Offer/Answer Model and Backward-Compatibility Considerations

   When offering FEC grouping using SDP in an Offer/Answer model
   [RFC3264], the following considerations apply.

   A node that is receiving an offer from a sender may or may not
   understand line grouping.  It is also possible that the node
   understands line grouping but it does not understand the "FEC-FR"
   semantics.  From the viewpoint of the sender of the offer, these
   cases are indistinguishable.

   When a node is offered a session with the "FEC-FR" grouping semantics
   but it does not support line grouping or the FEC grouping semantics,
   the node responds to the offer either:

   o  With an answer that ignores the grouping attribute.

      In this case, the original sender of the offer MUST first check
      whether using the "FEC" grouping semantics from Section 4.1 will

      mind.  If using the "FEC" semantics rather than the "FEC-FR"
      semantics still provides an exact association among the source and
      repair flows, the sender of the offer MUST send a new offer using
      the "FEC" semantics.  However, if an exact association cannot be
      described, the sender MUST send a new offer without FEC.

   o  With a refusal to the request (e.g., 488 Not Acceptable Here or
      606 Not Acceptable in SIP).

      In this case, if the sender of the offer still wishes to establish
      the session, it MUST first check whether using the "FEC" grouping
      semantics from Section 4.1 will create any ambiguity or not, while
      keeping its limitations in mind.  If using the "FEC" semantics
      rather than the "FEC-FR" semantics still provides an exact
      association among the source and repair flows, the sender of the
      offer SHOULD send a new offer using the "FEC" semantics.  However,
      if an exact association cannot be described, the sender SHOULD
      send a new offer without FEC.

   This behaviour is as specified in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc3388bis].  Note
   that in both cases described above, when the sender of the offer
   sends a new offer with the "FEC" semantics, and the node understands
   it, the session will be established and the rules pertaining to the
   "FEC" semantics will apply.

   If the node does not understand the "FEC" semantics, it responds to
   the offer, as specified in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc3388bis], either (1)
   with an answer that ignores the grouping attribute, or (2) with a
   refusal to the request.  In the first case, the sender MUST send a
   new offer without FEC.  In the second case, if the sender of the
   offer still wishes to establish the session, it SHOULD retry the
   request with an offer without FEC.


5.  Security Considerations

   There is a weak threat for the receiver that the FEC grouping can be
   modified to indicate FEC relationships that do not exist.  Such
   attacks may result in failure of FEC to protect, and/or mishandle
   other media payload streams.  The receiver SHOULD do an integrity
   check on SDP and follow the security considerations of SDP [RFC4566]
   to only trust SDP from trusted sources.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following semantics with IANA in
   Semantics for the 'group' SDP Attribute under SDP Parameters:
