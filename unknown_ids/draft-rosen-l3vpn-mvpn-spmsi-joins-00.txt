Abstract

   "S-PMSI Join" messages are used in PIM-based MVPN procedures to bind
   particular multicast flows to particular tunnels through a core
   network.  This document specifies extensions to the S-PMSI Join
   mechanism that allow S-PMSI Join messages to specify IPv6 multicast
   flows, that allow S-PMSI Join messages to specify MPLS tunnels, and
   that allow a single UDP datagram to contain multiple S-PMSI Join
   messages.  It also specifies how to send PIM IPv6 control messages
   over a PIM/IPv4 tunnel.

1. Specification of requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. Introduction

   "S-PMSI Join" messages [MVPN] are used in PIM-based MVPN procedures
   to bind particular multicast flows to particular tunnels through a
   core network.  This document specifies extensions to the S-PMSI Join
   mechanism that are that allow S-PMSI Join messages to specify IPv6
   multicast flows, that allow S-PMSI Join messages to specify MPLS
   tunnels, that to allow a single UDP datagram to contain multiple
   S-PMSI Join messages.  This document also specifies how to send PIM
   IPv6 control messages over a PIM/IPv4 tunnel.

   This document uses terminology defined in [MVPN]: C-Source, C-Group,
   C-flow, P-Group.


3. S-PMSI Join Extensions

   The S-PMSI Join message is defined in section 7.4.2.2 of [MVPN].  In
   this specification, we define the "type 2" and "type 3" S-PMSI Joins,
   which are used when the S-PMSI tunnel is a P2MP LSP created by mLDP,
   and the tunnel is to carry C-flows of, respectively, IPv4 or IPv6
   multicast traffic.

   The use of these messages with "wild card" addresses is specified in
   [MVPN_WILD].

3.2. IPv6 (S,G) with GRE/IPv4 P-tunnels

   MVPN defines the S-PMSI Join type (type 1) used when assigning IPv4
   (S,G) to a GRE/IPv4 P-tunnel.  When assigning IPv6 (S,G) to a
   GRE/IPv4 P-tunnel, S-PMSI Join type 4 is used, and the C-Source and
   C-Group are IPv6 addresses.  The P-Group address is an IPv4 address.

3.3. Encapsulation of S-PMSI Joins in UDP Datagrams

   All S-PMSI Joins are encapsulated in UDP datagrams.

   If a UDP datagram contains a type 1 or type 2 S-PMSI Join, it MUST be
   sent in an IPv4 datagram.

   If a UDP datagram contains a type 3 or type 4 S-PMSI Join, it MUST be
   sent in an IPv6 datagram.  If an IPv4-based protocol is being used to
   create the P-tunnels, then the IPv6 Source Address field of the UDP
   datagram SHOULD be the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address [RFC4291] that
   corresponds to the IPv4 address that the originating PE router uses
   when participating in the protocol used to build the P-tunnels.

   A single UDP datagram MAY carry multiple S-PMSI Join Messages, as
   many as can fit entirely within it.  If there are multiple S-PMSI
   Joins in a UDP datagram, they MUST be of the same S-PMSI Join type.
   The end of the last S-PMSI Join (as determined by the S-PMSI Join
   length field) MUST coincide with the end of the UDP datagram, as
   determined by the UDP length field.  When processing a received UDP
   datagram that contains one or more S-PMSI Joins, a router MUST be
   able to process all the S-PMSI Joins that fit into the datagram.


4. PE-PE PIM/IPv6 over IPv4 P-Tunnel

   If a VPN customer is using PIM over IPv6, but the SP is using an IPv4
   infrastructure (i.e., is using an IPv4-based control protocol to
   construct its P-tunnels), then the PE routers will need to originate
   PIM control messages in IPv6 form, and send such messages through the
   P-tunnels.  The IPv6 Source Address field of any such IPv6 packet
   SHOULD be the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address [RFC4291] that corresponds to
   the IPv4 address that the originating PE router uses when
   participating in the protocol used to build the P-tunnels.  If the
   IPv6 Destination Address field is the multicast address ALL-PIM-
   ROUTERS, the IPv6 form of the address (ff02::d) is used.


5. IANA Considerations

   [MVPN] creates an IANA registry for the "S-PMSI Join Message Type
   Field". This document requires three new values:

     - The value 2 should be registered, and its description should read
       "mLDP P2MP S-PMSI for IPv4 traffic (unaggregated)".

Internet Draft  draft-rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-spmsi-joins-00.txt  February 2010


     - The value 3 should be registered, and its description should read
       "mLDP P2MP S-PMSI for IPv6 traffic (unaggregated)".

     - The value 4 should be registered, and its description should read
       "GRE S-PMSI for IPv6 traffic (unaggregated)".



6. Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations beyond those of
   [MVPN].
