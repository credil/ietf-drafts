Internet-Draft                RADIUS-PMIPv6                November 2008


Abstract

   This document defines a RADIUS based interface between the Mobile
   Access Gateway and the RADIUS server that is used to download the per
   Mobile Node Policy Profile from the remote Policy Store.  The RADIUS
   interactions take place when the Mobile Node attaches, authenticates
   and authorizes to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  Furthermore, this
   document also defines a RADIUS based interface between the Local
   Mobility Anchor and the RADIUS server for authorizing received
   initial Proxy Binding Update messages for the mobility service
   session.  In addition to the mobility session setup related RADIUS
   interaction, this document defines the baseline for both the Mobile
   Access Gateway and the Local Mobility Anchor generated accounting.

Internet-Draft                RADIUS-PMIPv6                November 2008


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] is network based mobility
   management protocol which allows IP mobility session continuity for a
   Mobile Node (MN) without its involvement in mobility management
   signaling.  A Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) represents the MN and is
   authorized to send mobility management signaling messages on behalf
   of the MN.  Before the MAG is able to perform the required mobility
   management signaling, it needs to know at minimum a Local Mobility
   Anchor (LMA) address and the MN Identifier (MN-ID).  This per MN
   Policy Profile (PP) information is stored in a Policy Store (PS),
   which may be local to the MAG or accessible remotely, for example,
   through an authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA)
   infrastructure.

   This document defines a RADIUS [RFC2865] based profile and
   corresponding attributes to be used on the AAA interface between the
   MAG and the RADIUS server.  The interface that is used to download
   the per MN Policy Profile from the remote Policy Store.  The RADIUS
   interactions take place when the MN attaches, authenticates and
   authorizes to a PMIPv6 domain.  Furthermore, this document also
   defines a RADIUS based interface between the LMA and the RADIUS
   server for authorizing received initial Proxy Binding Update (PBU)
   messages for the mobility service session.  In addition to the
   mobility session setup related RADIUS interaction, this document
   defines the baseline for both the MAG and the LMA generated
   accounting.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions found in
   [RFC5213] and [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].


3.  Solution Overview

   The interface between the MAG and the RADIUS server is used to
   download a Policy Profile (PP) from the RADIUS server to the MAG.
   The downloading of the Policy Profile is part of the network access
   authentication and authorization procedure that takes place when a MN
   roams into or within a PMIPv6 domain.  In this solution the MAG acts
   as the Network Access Server (NAS).

Internet-Draft                RADIUS-PMIPv6                November 2008


   The choice of the authentication mechanism is specific to an access
   system, but could be based on the Extensible Authentication Protocol
   (EAP) [RFC3748].  During the network access authentication procedure,
   the MAG acting as a NAS queries the RADIUS server through the AAA
   infrastructure.  If the RADIUS server detects that the subscriber is
   also authorized for the PMIPv6 mobility service, the subscriber
   policy profile is returned along with the successful network access
   authentication answer to the MAG.

   After the MN has successfully been authenticated and authorized to
   the network access, the MAG sends a PBU to the LMA in order to setup
   or update the mobility service session for the MN.  Upon receiving
   the PBU the LMA interacts with the RADIUS server and fetches the
   relevant subscriber policy, authorization and security information
   related to the PMIPv6 mobility session.  This specification assumes
   that the RADIUS server is the central entity for managing everything
   related to PMIPv6 subscription and mobility session, possibly even
   including the allocation of Home Network Prefixes (HPN).  This
   specification also assumes that the Security Association (SA) between
   the MAG and the LMA is already in place.  How the SA is established
   is outside of scope of this specification.

   Due the obvious similarities between the PMIPv6 Policy Profile
   download and Mobile IPv6 integrated scenario bootstrapping
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-integrated-dhc] this specification can
   re-use several RADIUS attributes defined for Mobile IPv6 purposes
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius].  However, some additional PMIPv6 specific
   attributes and functionality is needed.


4.  Attributes

4.1.  MIP6-Feature-Vector

   The MIP6-Feature-Vector attribute is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius].  This document only reserves new capability
   bits according to the rules in [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-integrated].  The
   following capability flag bits are defined in this document:

   PMIP6_SUPPORTED (0x0000010000000000)

      When the MAG/NAS sets this bit in the MIP6-Feature-Vector
      attribute, it is an indication to the RADIUS server that the NAS
      supports PMIPv6.  When the RADIUS server sets this bit in the
      response MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP, it indicates that the RADIUS
      server also has PMIPv6 support.  This capability flag bit can also
      be used to allow PMIPv6 mobility support in a subscription
      granularity.

Internet-Draft                RADIUS-PMIPv6                November 2008


   IP4_HOA_SUPPORTED (0x0000020000000000)

      Assignment of the IPv4-HoA is supported
      [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].  When the MAG sets this bit
      in the MIP6-Feature-Vector attribute, it indicates that the MAG
      implements a minimal functionality of a DHCP server (and a relay)
      and is able to deliver IPv4-HoA to the MN.  When the RADIUS server
      sets this flag bit in the response MIP6-Feature-Vector attribute,
      it indicates that the RADIUS server has authorized the use of
      IPv4-HoA for the MN.  If this bit is unset in the returned MIP6-
      Feature-Vector attribute, the RADIUS server does not authorize the
      configuration of IPv4 address.

   LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED (0x0000040000000000)

      Direct routing of IP packets between MNs anchored to the same MAG
      is supported.  When a MAG sets this flag bit in the MIP6-Feature-
      Vector, it indicates that routing IP packets between MNs anchored
      to the same MAG is supported, without reverse tunneling packets
      via the LMA or requiring any Route Optimization related signaling
      (e.g. the Return Routability Procedure in [RFC3775]) prior direct
      routing.  If this flag bit is unset in the returned MIP6-Feature-
      Vector AVP, the RADIUS server does not authorize direct routing of
      packets between MNs anchored to the same MAG.  This policy feature
      MUST be supported per MN and subscription basis.


   The MIP6-Feature-Vector attribute is also used on the LMA to the
   RADIUS server interface.  Using the capability announcement attribute
   it is possible to perform a simple capability negotiation between the
   LMA and the RADIUS server.  Those capabilities that are announced by
   both parties are also known to be mutually supported.

4.2.  Mobile-Node-Identifier

   The Mobile-Node-Identifier attribute is of type String and contains
   the mobile node identifier (MN-Identifier, see [RFC5213]) in a NAI
   [RFC4282] format.  This AVP is used on the MAG to the RADIUS server
   interface.

   The Mobile-Node-Identifier attribute is returned in the Access-Accept
   message that ends a successful authentication (and possibly an
   authorization) exchange between the MAG and the RADIUS server,
   assuming the RADIUS server is also able to provide the MAG with a MN-
   Identifier that guarantees mobility session continuity in the first
   place.  The MAG SHOULD use the received MN-Identifier as the MN-ID in
   the subsequent PBUs.  The MAG is allowed to discard the RADIUS server
   provided identity if it has other means of finding out a MN-ID that

   guarantees mobility session continuity.

4.3.  Service-Selection

   The Service-Selection attribute is of type String, encoded as UTF-8
   [RFC3629], and contains the name of the service or the external
   network that the mobility service should be associated with.  The
   RADIUS server MAY return the Service-Selection attribute to the MAG
   and in that way indicate the default service to the MAG.  Between the
   LMA to the RADIUS server interface, the LMA MAY populate the Service-
   Selection attribute with the service information found from the
   received PBU, if such information is available [RFC5149].

      This field is of type String and contains the Service Identifier
      the MN MUST be associated with. This specification allows
      international identifier strings that are based on the use of
      Unicode characters, encoded as UTF-8 [RFC3629].

         Editor's note: we might need to address normalization here.


4.4.  MIP6-HA

   The MIP6-HA attribute is defined in [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius].  In the
   scope of this specification the attribute contains an IPv6 address of
   the LMA in the network byte order.

   Editor's note: we probably should also define an attribute to carry
   IPv4 address of the LMA.  Or then we could always use "IPv4-
   compatible IPv6 address" to carry the IPv4 address of the LMA.

4.5.  MIP6-HA-FQDN

   The MIP6-HA-FQDN attribute is defined in [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius].  In
   the scope of this specification the attribute contains a Fully
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the LMA.

4.6.  MIP6-HL-Prefix

   The MIP6-HL-Prefix attribute is defined in [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius].
   In the scope of this specification the attribute contains the MN-HNP
   of the MN in the network byte order.  The low 64 bits of the IPv6
   address MUST be all zeroes.  The high 64 bits of the IPv6 address are
   used as the MN-HNP.  The primary use of this AVP is to carry the IPv6
   Home Network Prefix, if available, from the RADIUS server to the MAG.

   The MIP6-IPv4-Home-Address attribute is of type Address and contains
   the IPv4-HoA of the MN in the network byte order.  The primary use of
   this attribute is to carry the IPv4-HoA

5.  MAG to RADIUS server interface

5.1.  General

   The MAG to the RADIUS server interface is primarily used for
   downloading the Policy Profile (i.e., to bootstrap the PMIPv6
   mobility service session) when a MN attaches, authenticates and
   authorizes to a PMIPv6 domain.  Whenever the MAG sends a RADIUS
   request message to the RADIUS server, the User-Name attribute SHOULD
   contain the MN identity.  At minimum the home network realm of the MN
   MUST be available at the MAG when the network access authentication
   takes place.  Otherwise the MAG is not able to route the RADIUS
   request messages towards the correct RADIUS server.  The MN identity
   MUST be in Network Access Identifier (NAI) [RFC4282] format.

   attributes SHOULD be included in RADIUS messages during the
   authentication and authorization process.

6.  LMA to RADIUS server interface

6.1.  General

   The LMA to the RADIUS server interface may be used for multiple
   purposes.  These include the authorization of the incoming PBU,
   dynamic allocation of the MN-HNP from address pools managed by the
   RADIUS server, updating the RADIUS server with the LMA address in the
   case the LMA was dynamically allocated by the MAG, possible MAG to
   LMA Security Association security related information retrieval,
   accounting and PMIPv6 session management.

   Whenever the LMA sends a RADIUS request message to the RADIUS server,
   the User-Name attribute MUST contain the MN identity.  The identity
   MUST be in a NAI format.  The LMA MAY retrieve the MN identity
   information from the PBU MN-ID mobility option.

   If the PBU contains the MN Link-Layer Identifier option, the Calling-
   Station-Id attribute SHOULD be included in the request message
   containing the received Link-Layer Identifier.  Furthermore, if the
   PBU contains the Service Selection mobility option [RFC5149], the
   Service-Selection attribute SHOULD be included in the request message
   containing the received service identifier.

   The LMA and the RADIUS server use the MIP6-HL-Prefix attribute to
   exchange the MN-HNP when appropriate.  The low 64 bits of the prefix
   must be all zeroes.  Similarly, the LMA and the RADIUS server use the
   MIP6-IPv4-Home-Address attribute to exchange the MN IPv4-HoA when
   appropriate.  If the MIP6-HL-Prefix is set to an all zeroes address
   (i.e., 0::0) in the request message, it is an indication that the

Internet-Draft                RADIUS-PMIPv6                November 2008


   RADIUS server needs to assign the MN-HNP and return it to the LMA in
   the response message.  If the MIP6-IPv4-Home-Address is set to all
   zeroes (i.e., 0.0.0.0) in the request message, it is an indication
   that the RADIUS server needs to assign the MN IPv4-HoA and return it
   to the LMA in the response message.

6.2.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which PMIPv6 specific
   attributes SHOULD be included in the RADIUS messages during the
   authorization process.


     Request   Accept   Reject   Challenge   #    Attribute
     1         0        0        0           TBD  MIP6-HA
     0-1       0        0        0           TBD  MIP6-HL-Prefix
     0-1       0        0        0           TBD  MIP6-IPv4-Home-Address
     0-1       0-1      0        0           TBD  MIP6-Feature-Vector
     0-1       0        0        0           TBD  Service-Selection
     1         0        0        0           TBD  Mobile-Node-Identifier
     1         0        0        0           TBD  PMIP6-MAG-Address
     0-1       0        0        0           31   Calling-Station-Id



7.  Accounting

   Editor's note: these sections will be revised.

7.1.  Accounting at LMA

   The accounting at the LMA to AAA server interface is based on
   [RFC2865] and [RFC2866].  The interface must support the transfer of
   accounting records needed for service control and charging.  These
   include (but may not be limited to): time of binding cache entry
   creation and deletion, octets sent and received by the MN in bi-
   directional tunneling, etc.

7.2.  Accounting at MAG

   The accounting at the MAG to AAA server interface is based on
   [RFC2865] and [RFC2866].  The interface must also support the
   transfer of accounting records which include: time of binding cache
   entry creation and deletion, octets sent and received by the MN in
   bi-directional tunneling, etc.

   If there is data traffic between a visiting mobile node and a
   correspondent node that is locally attached to an access link



Xia, et al.                Expires May 7, 2009                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                RADIUS-PMIPv6                November 2008


   connected to the mobile access gateway, the mobile access gateway MAY
   optimize on the delivery efforts by locally routing the packets and
   by not reverse tunneling them to the mobile node's local mobility
   anchor.  In this case, local data traffic MUST be reported to AAA
   servers through RADIUS protocol.

7.3.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in accounting messages.


      Request   Interim  Stop     Attribute
      0-1       0        0-1      MIP6-HA
      0-1       0        0-1      MIP6-HL-Prefix
      0-1       0        0-1      MIP6-IPv4-Home-Address
      0-1       0        0-1      Service-Selection
      0-1       0        0-1      MIP6-Feature-Vector
      0-1       0-1      0-1      Mobile-Node-Identifier
      0-1       0        0-1      Calling-Station-Id
      0-1       0-1      0-1      PMIP6-MAG-Address



8.  Diameter Considerations

   Editor's note: The Diameter compatibility requires further work.  It
   needs to be evaluated, which attributes could be used as-is in
   Diameter specification for equivalent purposes.  Such alignment could
   ease the possible RADIUS-Diameter translation agent functionality
   considerably.


9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the RADIUS protocol [RFC2865], are
   applicable to this document.  The RADIUS messages may be transported
   between the MAG and/or the LMA to the RADIUS server via one or more
   AAA brokers or RADIUS proxies.  In this case the HA to the RADIUS
   server AAA communication rely on the security properties of the
   intermediate AAA brokers and RADIUS proxies.

   This document does not introduce any new security vulnerabilities
   that would not already have been identified in Mobile IPv6 integrated
   scenario bootstrapping [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-integrated-dhc]
   and its use of AAA [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-integrated].
