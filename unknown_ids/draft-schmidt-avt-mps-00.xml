      <t>This memo describes extensions for the RTP payload format defined in RFC3640 for the transport of MPEG Surround multi-channel audio. Additional MIME Type parameters are defined to signal backwards compatible transmission inside an MPEG-4 audio elementary stream. In addition a layered transmission scheme without using the MPEG-4 systems framework is presented to transport an MPEG Surround elementary stream via RTP in parallel with an RTP stream containing the downmixed audio data.</t>

    <section title="Introduction"
             toc="default">
      <t>
        <xref target="23003-1">MPEG Surround (Spatial Audio Coding, SAC)</xref> is an International Standard that was finalized by MPEG in January 2007. It is capable of re-creating N channels based on M&lt;N transmitted channels and additional control data. In the preferred modes of operating the spatial audio coding system, the M channels can either be a single mono channel or a stereo channel pair. The control data represents a significant lower data rate than the data rate required for transmitting all N channels, making the coding very efficient while at the same time ensuring compatibility with M channel devices.
       </t>
      <t>
        The MPEG Surround standard incorporates a number of tools enabling features that allow for broad application of the standard. A key feature is the ability to scale the spatial image quality gradually from very low spatial overhead towards transparency. Another key feature is that the decoder input can be made compatible to existing matrixed surround technologies.
       </t>
      <t> 
	      As an example, for 5.1 multi-channel audio, the MPEG Surround encoder creates a stereo (or mono) downmix signal and spatial information describing the full 5.1 material in a highly efficient parameterised format. The spatial information is transmitted alongside the downmix.
      </t>
      <t>
	      By using MPEG Surround, existing services can easily be upgraded to provide surround sound in a backward compatible fashion. While a stereo decoder in an existing legacy consumer device ignores the MPEG Surround data and plays back the stereo signal without any quality degradation, an MPEG Surround enabled decoder will deliver high quality multi-channel audio.
       </t>
      <t>The MPEG Surround decoder can operate in modes that render the multi-channel signal to multi-channel output, stereo output or operate in a two-channel headphone mode to produce a virtual surround output signal.

AudioSpecificConfig() is used as the configuration structure for MPEG-4 Audio as specified in <xref target="14496-3" />.

      <t>
        From a top-level perspective MPEG Surround data can be subdivided into configuration data contained in the SpatialSpecificConfig() (SSC) and the SpatialFrame() that contains the MPEG Surround payload. The configuration data can be signaled in-band or out-of-band. In the case of in-band signaling the SSC is conveyed in an SacDataFrame() jointly with a SpatialFrame(). In the case of out-of-band signaling the SSC is transmitted to the decoder separately, e.g. by SDP means.
        </t>
        <t>
        SpatialFrame()s may be transmitted either embedded into the downmix stream (<xref target="Embedded spatial audio data in AAC payloads" />) or as an individual elementary stream besides the downmix audio stream (<xref target="MPEG Surround Elementary Streams" />).
       </t>
       <t>The buffer definition for AAC decoders limits the size of an AU as specified in <xref target="14496-3" />. For high-bitrate applications that exceed this limit all MPEG Surround data MUST be put in a separate stream as defined in <xref target="MPEG Surround Elementary Streams" />.
      </t>
      <section title="Embedded spatial audio data in AAC payloads" anchor="Embedded spatial audio data in AAC payloads">
        <t>
          <xref target="14496-3" /> define the extension_payload() as a mechanism for transport of extension data inside AAC payloads. Typical extension data include SBR data and MPEG Surround data, i.e. a SacDataFrame() in extension_payload()s of type EXT_SAC_DATA. extension_payload()s reside inside the downmix AAC elementary stream. The resulting single elementary stream is transported as specified in <xref target="RFC3640" />. As AAC decoders are required to skip unknown extension data, MPEG Surround data can be embedded backwards compatible and be transported with the mechanism already described in <xref target="RFC3640" />.
        </t>
        <t>
          The SacDataFrame() includes a SpatialFrame() and an optional header that contains an SSC. Any SSC in a SacDataFrame() MUST be identical to the SSC conveyed via SDP for that stream.
        </t>
        <t>No new mode is introduced for SpatialFrame()s being embedded into AAC payloads. Either the modes AAC-lbr or AAC-hbr SHOULD be used. The additional MIME Type parameters as defined in <xref target="MIME Type registration" /> MUST be present when SpatialFrame()s are embedded into AAC payloads.
        </t>
        <t>For example:</t>
        <t>
          <figure>
            <artwork>  m=audio 5000 RTP/AVP 96
  a=rtpmap:96 mpeg4-generic/48000/2
  a=fmtp:96 streamType=5; profile-level-id=44; mode=AAC-hbr; config=131

    501185B6DA00;</artwork>
          </figure>
        </t>
        <t>In this example the stream specifies the HE-AAC Profile at Level 2 [Profile and Level Indication (PLI) 44] and the config string contains the hexadecimal representation of the HE-AAC ASC [audioObjectType=2 (AAC LC); extensionAudioObjectType=5 (SBR); samplingFrequencyIndex=0x6 (24kHz); extensionSamplingFrequencyIndex=0x3 (48kHz); channelConfiguration=2 (2.0 channels)] of the downmix AAC elementary stream using explicit backward compatible signaling.
        </t>
        <t>Furthermore, the stream specifies the MPEG Surround Baseline Profile at Level 3 (PLI55) and the MPS-config string contains the hexadecimal representation of the MPEG Surround ASC [audioObjectType=30 (MPEG Surround); samplingFrequencyIndex=0x3 (48kHz); channelConfiguration=6 (5.1 channels); sacPayloadEmbedding=1; SSC=(48 kHz; 32 slots; 525 tree; ResCoding=1; ResBands=[0,13,13,13])].
        </t>
         <t>Note that the a=fmtp lines of the example above have been wrapped to fit the page; they comprise each a single line in the SDP file.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="MPEG Surround Elementary Stream" anchor="MPEG Surround Elementary Streams">
        <t>
          MPEG Surround SpatialFrame()s can be present in an individual elementary stream. This stream complements the stream containing the downmix audio data, which may be coded by an arbitrary coding scheme. MPEG Surround elementary streams are packetized as specified in <xref target="RFC3640" />. The mode signaled and used for an MPEG Surround elementary stream MUST be either MPS-hbr or MPS-lbr. The MPS-hbr mode SHALL be used when the frame size may exceed 63 bytes, e.g. when high-bitrate residual coding is in use.
        </t>
        <t>
          The dependency relationships between the MPEG Surround elementary stream and the downmix stream are signaled as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-decoding-dependency" />.
        </t>
        <t>
          The media clocks of the MPEG Surround elementary stream and the downmix stream SHALL operate in the same clock domain, i.e. the clocks MUST NOT drift. RTCP sender reports MUST indicate that the stream timestamps are not drifting, i.e. that a single sender report for each stream is sufficient to establish unambiguous timing. The sampling rate of the MPEG Surround signal and the decoded downmix signal MUST be identical.
        </t>
        <t>
        If HE-AAC is used as the coding scheme for the downmix, the RTP clock-rate of the downmix MAY be the sampling rate of the AAC core, i.e. the clock-rate of the MPEG Surround elementary stream is an integer multiple of the clock-rate of the downmix stream.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that separate RTP streams have different random RTP timestamp offsets and therefore RTCP MUST be used to synchronize the coded downmix audio data and the MPEG surround elementary stream.

        RTP packets using the payload format defined in this memo are subject to the security considerations of the RTP specification <xref target="RFC3550" /> and <xref target="RFC3640" /> which is extended with this memo. This implies that confideniality of the media streams is achieved by encryption. Because the data compression used with this payload format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be performed on the compressed data so there is no conflict between the two operations.

              In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
              the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
              capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
              interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
              should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

          <abstract>
            <t>This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.
