Internet-Draft             G.Bond/Ethernet MIB                 June 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Ethernet-based xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding, a.k.a.  G.Bond/Ethernet,
   is specified in ITU-T G.998.2 recommendation [G.998.2], which defines
   a method for bonding (or aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines into a
   single bi-directional logical link, carrying an Ethernet traffic.

   The MIB module, defined in this document, provides G.Bond/Ethernet
   specific objects for the management of G.998.2 bonded interfaces,
   extending the common bonding objects specified in GBOND-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The DSL Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding

   This document makes use of the DSL Forum technical report Management
   Framework for xDSL Bonding [WT-159], defining a management model and
   a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded xDSL interfaces.

4.  Relation to other MIB modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB), G.Bond MIB (GBOND-MIB), and EFM Copper MIB (EFM-
   CU-MIB).

Internet-Draft             G.Bond/Ethernet MIB                 June 2007


4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB module

   A G.Bond/Ethernet port is a private case of a Bonded multi-pair xDSL
   interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
   objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].  In particular, an interface
   index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of G.Bond/Ethernet ports
   and channels in a managed system.

4.2.  Relationship to G.Bond MIB module

   GBOND-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module defines management
   objects common for all Bonded multi-pair xDSL interfaces.  In
   particular it describes the bonding management, port and channel
   configuration, initialization sequence etc.

   Both GBOND-MIB and GBOND-ETH-MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage a
   G.Bond/Ethernet port.

4.3.  Relationship to EFM Copper MIB module

   EFM-CU-MIB [I-D.ietf-hubmib-efm-cu-mib] module defines objects for
   managing Ethernet in the First Mile Copper (EFMCu) interfaces
   10PASS-TS and 2BASE-TL, defined in IEEE Std 802.3-2005 [802.3].
   These interfaces are based on Single-pair High-speed Digital
   Subscriber Line (SHDSL) [G.991.2] and Very High speed Digital
   Subscriber Line (VDSL) [G.993.1] technology respectively, and can be
   optionally aggregated (bonded).

   ITU-T G.998.2 specification extends the IEEE 802.3 Clause 61 bonding
   to work over any xDSL technology, providing the ability to bond
   individual channels as well as physical lines.

   EFM-CU-MIB can be used to manage all aspects of the EFMCu interfaces,
   including the management of SHDSL/VDSL lines.  GBOND-MIB and GBOND-
   ETH-MIB modules provide management objects only for the bonding part,
   leaving the management of the individual xDSL interfaces (lines/
   channels) to the respective xDSL MIB modules.

7.  Security Considerations

   There is a number of managed objects defined in the GBOND-ETH-MIB
   module that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.
   Writing to these objects can have potentially disruptive effects on
   network operation, for example:

   o  Changing of gBondEthPortConfTable configuration paratemers (e.g.
      gBondEthTcAdminType) MAY lead to a complete service interruption,
      in case the specified PTM-TC encapsulation type is not supported
      by the remote end.

   The user of the GBOND-ETH-MIB module must therefore be aware that
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in the GBOND-ETH-MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in
   some environments since, collectively, they provide information about
   the performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.

   In such environments it is important to control also GET and NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.



Beili & Morgenstern     Expires December 7, 2007               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft             G.Bond/Ethernet MIB                 June 2007


   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations
