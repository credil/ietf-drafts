Internet-Draft           SOAP-over-CoAP Binding             January 2011


1.  Introduction

   The intention of this document is to provide a basic approach for a
   SOAP-over-CoAP binding.  Readers of this document should be basically
   familiar with the CoAP draft [I-D.ietf-core-coap], SOAP
   [W3C.REC-soap12-part0-20070427], SOAP HTTP Binding
   [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20070427] and SOAP UDP binding specifications
   [SOAP-over-UDP].  Parts of this document are derived from these
   existing specifications.  This document will not provide a
   comprehensive specification, but may be a basis for further
   discussions and to identify required changes in the current CoAP
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap] protocol design which is on the way to become an
   IETF standard.  These changes might not be identified directly as the
   binding described herein will not exploit from all features of CoAP
   but use CoAP as an 'application layer transport protocol' as SOAP
   already does with HTTP [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20070427].

1.1.  Motivation

   The motivation behind this document is based on the initial I-D
   [I-D.moritz-6lowapp-dpws-enhancements] and the resulting discussions.
   The described binding herein is a major enabler for the efforts
   towards usage of SOAP Web services for highly resource constrained
   devices like wireless sensor nodes.  As core protocol the OASIS
   Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) [DPWS] is applied.  By
   combining DPWS with EXI, message size can be reduced significantly as
   presented in [I-D.moritz-6lowapp-dpws-enhancements].  By providing a
   binding of SOAP to CoAP, the message overhead can be reduced
   significantly.  Furthermore, SOAP is not required to use
   inappropriate mechanisms like TCP congestion control.  Reliably
   messaging is guaranteed by CoAP internal mechanisms and thus
   expensive retransmissions independent of successful or unsuccessful
   delivery as required by the SOAP-over-UDP binding are avoided.  In
   summary, the major advantages are:

   o  more compact message format

   o  probably lower message parsing efforts compared to standard HTTP
      headers

   o  avoid inappropriate TCP usage implied by SOAP-over-HTTP binding

   o  avoid unreliable nature of unicast SOAP-over-UDP binding

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.3.  Terminology and Definitions

   Defined below are the basic definitions for the terms used in this
   specification.

   Receiver
           The endpoint terminating a SOAP/CoAP message

   Sender
           The endpoint originating a SOAP/CoAP message

   SOAP/CoAP message
           A CoAP message containing a SOAP envelope in the CoAP message
           body

   This specification uses the constructs [action], [destination],
   [message id], [reply endpoint], [address] as defined by in WS-
   Addressing [W3C.PR-ws-addr-core-20060321].

   The SOAP CoAP Binding is optional and SOAP nodes are not required to
   implement it.  A SOAP node that correctly and completely implements
   the SOAP CoAP Binding may to be said to 'conform to the CoAP
   Binding.'

1.4.  Requirements

   This specification intends to meet the following requirements:

   o  Support a one-way message-exchange pattern (MEP) where a SOAP
      envelope is carried in a CoAP message from Sender to Receiver
      only.

   o  Support a request-response message-exchange pattern (MEP) where
      SOAP envelopes are carried in CoAP messages from Sender to
      Receiver and back from the origin Receiver to the origin Sender.

   Even if reasonable, supporting multicast transmissions of SOAP
   envelopes carried in CoAP messages are out of scope of this version
   of this document and require further research.  This binding supports
   SOAP 1.2 [W3C.REC-soap12-part0-20070427] Envelopes.  Supporting SOAP
   1.1 envelopes is out of scope but might be added in future versions
   of this document.

Internet-Draft           SOAP-over-CoAP Binding             January 2011


   Messages conforming to either SOAP specification can use this
   binding.  This specification relies on WS-Addressing.  The SOAP
   envelope MUST use the mechanisms defined in WS-Addressing
   [W3C.PR-ws-addr-core-20060321].


2.  Use of CoAP

   This binding of SOAP to CoAP is intended to make appropriate use of
   CoAP as an application protocol.  For example, successful and failure
   responses are indicated by the appropriated CoAP response codes (e.g.
   2xx, 4xx, 5xx).  This binding is not intended to fully exploit the
   features of CoAP, but rather to use CoAP specifically for the purpose
   of communicating with other SOAP nodes implementing the same binding.

2.1.  CoAP Content-Type

   Conforming implementations of this binding:

   o  MAY be capable of sending and receiving SOAP/CoAP messages
      serialized using media type 'application/soap+xml'.

   o  MAY be capable of sending and receiving SOAP/CoAP messages
      serialized using media type 'application/exi'.

   o  MUST send requests and responses using such media types provide
      for at least the transfer of SOAP XML Infoset, including
      'application/soap+xml' and 'application/exi'.

   A SOAP/CoAP message MUST contain the CoAP Content-type Identifies
   Option and MUST contain a value which satisfies the three points
   above.

   Note: CoAP has no header option which corresponds to HTTP Accept.
   Thus the web methods known from the HTTP binding is not possible.  In
   the current CoAP draft only view information are available how to
   define own header fields.


3.  Binding Name

   This binding is identified by the URI (see SOAP 1.2 Part 1
   [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20070427] SOAP Protocol Binding Framework):
   http://www.ws4d.org/2011/01/soap/bindings/CoAP/

   Note: The binding name is tentative but required to indicate the
   corresponding binding e.g. in the WSDL of a service.

Internet-Draft           SOAP-over-CoAP Binding             January 2011


4.  Transport Layer Binding

   The CoAP binding MUST operate over UDP transport layer.

   Note: CoAP defines a maximum message size which refers to the IP
   layer.  The existing UDP binding instead refers only to UDP and
   defines a general maximum packet size independent of IP.

4.1.  Source Address and Port

   The source address MUST be supplied at the IP packet level and MUST
   be the IPv4 address (limited to unicast addresses) or IPv6 address
   (limited to unicast addresses) of the sender; the receiver SHOULD
   reject IP packets containing a SOAP/CoAP message that have
   inappropriate values for the source address.

   Even though CoAP is intended to be used on the well-known ports
   defined in CoAP-04, the use of CoAP is not limited to these ports.
   As a result, it is possible to have a dedicated CoAP server for
   handling SOAP processing on a distinct port.


5.  Addressing

5.1.  URI Scheme

   The SOAP CoAP binding defines a base URI according to the rules in
   CoAP-04.  I.e., the base URI is the CoAP Request-URI or the value of
   the CoAP Location option field.

5.2.  Destination Addressing

   WS-Addressing defines a URI,
   'http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing/anonymous', that can appear in
   the [address] property of an endpoint reference.  If the [reply
   endpoint] property of a SOAP message transmitted over CoAP has an
   [address] property with this value, the UDP source address (and
   source port) is considered to be the address to which reply messages
   should be sent.

   The implied value of the [reply endpoint] property for SOAP messages
   transmitted over CoAP is an endpoint reference with an [address]
   property whose value is
   'http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing/anonymous'.

6.  Message Patterns

   This specification supports the following message patterns:

   o  Unicast one-way

   o  Unicast request, unicast response

   as described in the remainder of this section.  All SOAP/CoAP
   messages MUST use the POST method of CoAP, whereby POST is
   interpreted in accordance to RFC2616.

   Note: In the current draft of CoAP-04, response Code 2.00 OK is only
   possible for GET methods.  But GET is not the appropriate method for
   this binding.

   Note: There is no Action field similar to SOAPAction in HTTP, so
   extensions are required to the basic CoAP Options.  Hence the web
   method feature of the HTTP binding cannot be made possible.

   CoAP defines Proxy mechanism for caching of responses.  Because the
   CoAP binding defined herein is intended for service communication and
   not RESTful resource manipulation, caching should be avoided.  CoAP
   defines the Max-Age option to be default a non-zero value.  Hence
   each SOAP/CoAP message MUST contain the Max-Age option and the value
   MUST be zero.

6.1.  Request response

   To match a request with a response the CoAP Token Option can be used.
   The CoAP Token Option SHOULD be carried in all request-response SOAP/
   CoAP messages.  WS-Addressing defines the [message id] property to
   identify messages in time and space and to match requests with
   response.  In case of using the CoAP/SOAP binding the [message id]
   property is SHOULD be empty and MUST contain a value in case if the
   CoAP Token Option is not present.

   Note: The intention of this paragraph is to reduce message size.  The
   [message id] property has a typical size of 45 Bytes and cannot by
   compressed by knowledge based encodings like EXI because the value of
   this property is unique in each message.  The CoAP Token Option may
   be much more compact by providing the same functionality.

   CoAP defines the feature of deferred responses where a transaction
   ACK is sent as response to a CON message to indicate a deferred
   response.  If the value of the [reply endpoint] of the request is
   'http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing/anonymous', the ACK message
   SHOULD NOT carry any payload (e.g. a SOAP Envelope) in the CoAP

Internet-Draft           SOAP-over-CoAP Binding             January 2011


   message body if not required by the application logic.  If the value
   of the [reply endpoint] is not
   'http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing/anonymous', the origin Receiver
   cannot guarantee that the response is intended to be sent to the same
   entity like the client and SHOULD include a SOAP Envelope providing
   details of the request for the entity behind the [reply endpoint].

6.2.  Retransmission

   To avoid repeated packet collisions, any retransmission
   implementation SHOULD observe good practices such as using
   exponential back-off algorithms and spreading.  An implementation
   SHOULD use the Confirmable (CON) transaction message mechanism
   described in the CoAP specification to avoid unnecessary
   retransmissions.  For each transmission of such a message, the value
   of the [message id] property and the CoAP Token Option MUST be the
   same.

   Note: WS-Event Delivery should not use CON due to ACK flood at Event
   Source.  Multicast messages also should use NON messages.  Not sure
   if such requirements are in scope of this document.


7.  CoAP Header Options

   In this section, the CoAP header and CoAP header options usage is
   described in detail.

7.1.  Unicast one-way

   The unicast one-way message pattern consists of only one request
   without a response.  Due to the CoAP binding the request consists of
   one CoAP transaction.  If CoAP Confirmable messaging is used, an
   empty CoAP ACK message must be send back to the origin sender to
   indicate success or failure.

   The request is formulated according to the table below, but can be
   extended for application specific needs.

Internet-Draft           SOAP-over-CoAP Binding             January 2011


   | CoAP message | SOAP message serialized according to the rules for |
   | body         | carrying SOAP messages in the media type given by  |
   |              | the Content-type Option.                           |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+

                 Table 3: Unicast request-response Request

   If the request is send as Non-Confirmable CoAP message, no CoAP ACK
   is send back to the origin requester.  In this case, for the
   response, the origin Receiver has to initiate a new CoAP transaction
   which can be either Non-Confirmable or Confirmable.

   If the request is a Confirmable CoAP message, the response consists
   of a CoAP ACK which may carry the response SOAP envelope as data in
   the CoAP message body.  For the response, the origin receiver may
   also initiate a new CoAP transaction after sending the CoAP ACK to
   the origin Sender, which can be either also Non-Confirmable or
   Confirmable. (see deferred responses in CoAP)

   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+

   | CoAP Status  | Status Code in accordance to codes defined in CoAP |
   | Code         | and interpreted as described in the SOAP-over-HTTP |
   |              | binding.  Note: CoAP describes only a subset of    |
   |              | HTTP status codes and adds own codes.  This must   |
   |              | require further alignment.                         |

   |              | identifying the transaction in time and space.     |
   |              | Only required if message is a CoAP Confirmable     |
