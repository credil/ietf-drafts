Abstract

   This document defines the framework for Distributed Conferencing
   (DCON).  The framework draws inspiration from the work carried out in
   the XCON working group, which has defined a complete architecture for
   centralized conferencing.  DCON is based on the idea that a

   distributed conference can be setup by appropriately orchestrating
   the operation of a number of XCON focus elements, each in charge of
   managing a certain number of participants.  Interaction between each
   participant and the corresponding conference focus is based on the
   standard XCON framework, whereas inter-focus interaction is defined
   in this document.

Internet-Draft     Distributed Conferencing Framework       January 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document presents an architecture capable to move the XCON
   scenario towards a distributed framework.  The requirements for DCON
   are presented in a separate document [6].  In such an architecture a
   number of entities are used to manage conference setup in the
   presence of clients which are distributed across a geographical
   network.  Each managing entity plays the role of a conference focus
   as defined in the XCON working group documents [8].

   Indeed, an XCON focus is in charge of managing a certain number of
   clients falling under its own "realm".  In order to move the XCON
   scope towards a distributed environment, we introduce inter-focus
   coordination, which is needed to effectively setup and manage
   conference instantiation and coordination.  As in the centralized
   case, we define logical entities and naming conventions.  An
   appropriate data model for distributed conferencing will be defined
   in a subsequent document and will extend, when needed, the XCON data
   model [9].  Furthermore, we propose the adoption of a suitable set of
   protocols which are complementary to the call signaling protocols and
   are needed to support advanced conferencing applications.


2.  Conventions

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [2] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.


3.  Terminology

   Distributed conferencing uses, when appropriate, and expands on the
   terminology introduced in the both the SIPPING [4] and XCON
   conferencing frameworks.  The following additional terms are defined
   for specific use within the distributed conferencing context.

   Conferencing Cloud:

      A specific pair composed of a centralized focus entity (XCON) and
      its associated distributed focus (DCON).  We will herein
      indifferently use both "cloud" and "island" to refer to a
      conferencing cloud.

Internet-Draft     Distributed Conferencing Framework       January 2008


   DCON Focus:

      A specific entity enabling communication of a centralized
      conferencing system with the outside world.  A DCON focus allows
      for the construction of a distributed conferencing system as a
      federation of centralized conferencing components.

   Focus Discovery:

      The capability to detect the presence of new focus entities in a
      distributed conferencing framework.

   Information Spreading:

      The spreading of conference related information among the focus
      entities in a distributed environment.

   Protocol Dispatching:

      The capabilty to appropriately forward/distribute messages of a
      natively centralized protocol in order to let them spread across a
      distributed environment.

   Label Swapping:

      The opportune swap of labels assigned to a specific resource,
      needed to avoid conflicts in the assignment of labels across
      several point-to-point communications regarding the same resource.


4.  Overview

   In order to build distributed conferencing on top of the already
   available centralized conferencing framework, we basically need to
   introduce two major functions: (i) a coordination level among
   conference focus entities; (ii) a way to effectively distribute
   conference state information.  As to the first point above, the
   coordination level is needed in order to manage a distributed
   conference along its entire life-cycle.  For instance, once a user
   decides to create a new conference, the corresponding conference
   focus has to distribute conference information to all other foci, in
   such a way as to enable other potential participants to retrieve the
   needed data and possibly subscribe to the event.  We herein assume
   that all the operations needed inside a single conference cloud are
   managed via the protocols and interfaces defined inside the XCON
   working group.  Hence, each single cloud keeps on being based on a
   star-topology graph for all what concerns the call signaling part.
   The various available stars are then connected through an upper-layer

   mesh-based topology providing inter-focus communication.  As depicted
   in Figure 1, the overall topology of the distributed conferencing
   scenario thus looks like an overlay network of focus entities, each
   managing an underlying "centralized" conferencing island.  In the
   most general case, we envisage to exploit extended Instant Messaging
   (IM) protocols for inter-focus communication.

   As to the second point mentioned above, it looks clear that a way to
   propagate information about conferences is needed when switching the
   view from a centralized to a distributed perspective.  Indeed,
   whenever a new conference is created (or an active conference changes
   its state) such an event has to be communicated to all interested (or



Romano, et al.            Expires July 26, 2008                 [Page 5]

   active) participants.  Given the intrinsic nature of the distributed
   framework (which actually expands the centralized one through the
   introduction of an overlay network of focus entities), the actual
   flow of information will always foresee the interaction among
   conference focus entities for both conference information exchanging
   and state changes notifications.  The same obviously applies also to
   the involved natively centralized protocols defined in the XCON
   framework.  A suitable mechanism has to be defined allowing for the
   dispatching of such centralized messages across the DCON network.
   The mechanism in question must be fully compliant with the existing
   operation of XCON clouds, which must keep their local participants
   totally unaware of the potential distributed nature of conferences.

   Conference state propagation can take place in a number of
   alternative ways.  For instance, each focus might flood the received
   information across the inter-focus communication mesh, thus
   guaranteeing that potential participants belonging to heterogeneous
   islands can be reached.  In such case, focus entities are "stateful",
   i.e. each of them stores information about current sessions and
   forwards such information to all peering entities in order to get
   them up-to-date with respect to available conference sessions.

   On the other hand, a distributed repository might be employed for the
   sake of storing conference information.  Focus entities would access
   such repository, both to publish (either upon creation of a new
   conference, or to notify a change in the state of an active
   conference) and to retrieve information about active conferences
   (e.g. when a new participant wants to access the list of ongoing/
   scheduled conference sessions he might be interested to join).  In
   this last case, focus entities are "stateless".

   Finally, a pure peer-to-peer approach can also be exploited for the
   purpose of conference state information spreading.


5.  Towards Distributed Conferencing

   In this section we first describe the overall architecture of a
   distributed conferencing framework, by highlighting both the involved
   entities and their interrelations.  Then, we delve into the details
   of some key use cases which help understand the typical interaction
   paradigm of a decentralized environment.

   As to the architecture, Figure 2 depicts how various XCON islands
   (just two in the picture to avoid confusion) can interact through the
   exchanging of synchronization messages between each pair of
   conferencing systems.  Such messages are needed in order to circulate
   conference information among all involved entities.  A dedicated

Internet-Draft     Distributed Conferencing Framework       January 2008


   protocol is obviously needed to take care of the communication
   between each pair: since its task is to synchronize the XCON and DCON
   pair, it will from now on be called XCON-DCON Synchronization
   Protocol (XDSP).  The requirements for this protocol are further
   analyzed in a companion draft [7].

   Inter-island coordination can be achieved via a number of available
   solutions (e.g.  SIP/SIMPLE, XMPP).  In this document we propose the
   exploitation of IM-based interaction.  More precisely, we think that
   the Server-to-Server (S2S) module based on the XMPP protocol
   perfectly satisfies the requirements imposed by the new architecture.

   Finally, media streams will directly flow between the XCON clouds
   once a distributed conference has been setup.  Distributed mixing,
   however, will be only marginally discussed in this draft, in favour
   of the distribution of signaling and control messages.

5.1.  Setting up a distributed conferencing environment

   In the following we are going to describe the typically required
   steps to setup a distributed conferencing environment.  As described
   in the introductory sections, an overlay network of focus entities,
   each managing an underlying "centralized" conferencing island, will
   be needed, and the following points will help clarify how to
   effectively setup a distributed conferencing and manage it.


   1.   Overlay Creation and Management

        To enable effective operation of the distributed conferencing
        framework, an overlay network made of all interconnected
        conferencing clouds MUST be created.  As an example, the
        mentioned overlay MAY be built by interconnecting all focus
        entities (with each such entity being the root of a local
        centralized conferencing cloud) through a full-meshed topology.
        Once the overlay is created, appropriate management of its
        structure SHOULD be envisaged; this includes, for example,
        dynamic updating of the topology information at the occurrence
        of relevant events (grafting/pruning of new centralized
        conferencing islands, etc.).

   2.   Focus Discovery

        An appropriate mechanism for the discovery of peering focus
        entities SHOULD be provided.  Given the sensitive nature of the
        shared information, an appropriate authentication mechanism
        SHOULD be adopted.  The trigger of the discovery process MAY be
        related to the concept of "presence"; in such case, an Instant
        Messaging (IM) based paradigm is RECOMMENDED.  Alternatively, a
        logically centralized, physically distributed repository (e.g.
        UDDI) MAY be employed as a single reference point for the
        discovery of peering entities.  A pure peer-to-peer approach can
        also be exploited for the same purpose.

   3.   Self-configuration

        At the occurrence of events like the grafting of a new cloud
        onto the overlay distributed conferencing network, the needed
        configuration steps SHOULD be performed in an automated fashion.
        This entails that all the news are appropriately exchanged
        across the overlay and, if needed, notified to the underlying
        centralized clouds as well.

Internet-Draft     Distributed Conferencing Framework       January 2008


   4.   Information Sharing

        The core of the operation of a distributed conferencing
        framework resides in the possibility to exchange information
        among all involved entities.  The information sharing process
        SHOULD be made as effective as possible, e.g. by limiting the
        information that is forwarded outside a single centralized
        conferencing cloud to the data that are strictly necessary in
        order to guarantee that the overall state of the overaly is
        consistent, yet not redundant.  Information sharing MAY be
        achieved either by exploiting a request/response paradigm, or
        through the adoption of asynchronous notification messages.  A
        combined use of both the aforementioned paradigms is
        RECOMMENDED.

   5.   Dynamic Update

        All the clouds participating in the distributed overlay MUST
        keep the peers updated with respect to worth-noting events
        happening in their local realm.  This MAY be achieved either by
        exploiting a request/response paradigm, or through the adoption
        of asynchronous notification messages.  A combined use of both
        the aforementioned paradigms is RECOMMENDED.  A pure peer-to-
        peer approach can also be exploited for the same purpose.

   6.   Distributed Conference Management

        In order to allow users' access to remotely created conferences,
        appropriate mechanisms MUST be provided by the framework.  Such
        mechanisms SHOULD enable transparent management of both locally-
        and remotely-created conference instances.  A pure peer-to-peer
        approach can be exploited for the same purpose.

   7.   Centralized Protocols Routing and Dispatching

        Focus entities MUST forward any centralized protocol message to
        their related peer in the distributed overlay whenever the
        message is directed to a receiver who does not belong to the
        local centralized system.  Natively centralized protocol
        messages include, but are not limited to, any protocol defined
        and specified in the XCON framework (e.g. conference control
        management and floor control) as well as DTMF messages
        propagation.  An example could be BFCP [5] messages the local
        floor control server might need to send to a user who is
        remotely participating in the conference (because she/he does
        not belong to the current XCON cloud).  Another example concerns
        BFCP messages a local user might send to the remote floor
        control server handling the remote distributed conference she/he



Romano, et al.            Expires July 26, 2008                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft     Distributed Conferencing Framework       January 2008


        is involved in.  Any message sent by local entities to local
        entities has to be treated in the usual centralized way
        according to the relative protocol specifications (i.e.
        dispatching shall not be involved).

   8.   Distributed Mixing

        As soon as two or more centralized conferencing islands get
        connected in order to provide for a distributed conferencing
        scenario, the need arises to cope with the issue of mixing media
        flows generated by the conference participants.  This
        challenging issue is currently considered out-of-scope in this
        document, which mainly focuses on the distribution of conference
        signalling/control information rather than addressing media
        management.

5.2.  Use-case scenarios and examples

   In this subsection we provide some examples of the operation of the
   distributed conferencing framework.

5.2.1.  Creating a new distributed conference

   Figure 3 illustrates how a distributed conference can be created and
   managed in a distributed environment.  A participant contacts its
   corresponding focus entity in order to request the creation of a new
   conference instance.  With respect to the centralized scenario, upon
   conference instantiation, in this case the focus has to publish
   conference information by notifying its related DCON focus.  This is
   done in order to allow other remote focus entities to get up-to-date
   information about available conferencing sessions.

5.2.2.  Retrieving information about available conferences

   Figure 4 illustrates how information about available centralized and
   distributed conferences can be retrieved.  A participant contacts its
   corresponding focus entity in order to request the above information.
   With respect to the centralized scenario, upon reception of a
   participant's request, the XCON focus has to forward the request to
   the related DCON focus.  It will be up to the distributed focus
   entity to provide such information, which will include the list of
   both centralized (local) and distributed (remote) conferences.  This
   way, a participant will be able to transparently keep on contacting
   the XCON focus to get all the information she/he needs in both cases.

5.2.3.  Joining a conference hosted by a foreign island

   Figure 5 illustrates how a participant can join a conference which is
   managed by a focus entity belonging to a foreign centralized island.
   The whole sequence diagram has been split in three parts to better
   help understanding all the required steps.  A participant contacts
   its corresponding focus entity in order to send the join request.
   With respect to the centralized scenario, upon reception of the
   participant's request, the local focus has to forward join
   information to the focus entity belonging to the island in which the
   conference in question was created.

   The following steps are performed in sequence:


   1.  once the client has locally joined the distributed conference by
       placing a SIP call to the focus she/he belongs to (XCON (A)), the
       focus chooses a new label for the client (A) which will be needed
       to opportunely dispatch all the messages related to her/him;

   2.  XCON (A) at this point forwards the join request to its related
       DCON focus entity (DCON (A)); in this example this is done by
       sending, through the XDSP protocol, a message called AddUser

       containing the newly assigned client's label A;

   3.  DCON (A) receives the join request; since it regards a new
       client, the DCON focus entity chooses a new label (e.g.  XYZ) and
       associates it with the just received label A; depending on the
       distributed conference the client wants to join, it associates
       the label (XYZ) with the DCON focus entity managing the XCON
       focus physically hosting the conference (DCON (B)) and forwards
       the join request to it;

   4.  DCON (B) receives the forwarded message through the XMPP-based
       S2S channel; since it regards a new client, DCON (B) chooses a
       new label (e.g.  B) and associates it with the just received
       label XYZ; since the conference the remote client (A) wants to
       join is physically hosted by XCON (B), the join request is
       forwarded there using the XDSP protocol, with an AddUser message
       containing the newly assigned label B which identifies the remote
       client;

   5.  XCON (B) receives the request, and thus associates the received
       label B with the remote Client (A); all the operations needed to
       add the new user to the conference are performed, and the new
       information is sent back to the client through the same path.
       All the involved labels (B, XYZ, A) will be opportunely swapped
       to route all the XCON protocols messages between the two
       entities.


   Once XCON (A) receives the confirmation that the user has been
   successfully added to the remote conference, together with the needed
   information, the client (A) is updated through a SIP REINVITE
   containing the BFCP information she/he will need to communicate with
   the Floor Control Server.  All BFCP messages sent from now on by the
   client to the Floor Control Server will be intercepted by the
   gateway, and then forwarded to the Floor Control Server of XCON (B).
   This case will be furtherly presented and discussed in the next
   section.

5.2.4.  Dispatching XCON protocols in DCON

   Figure 6 illustrates how natively centralized XCON protocols (BFCP,
   in the figure) can be opportunely dispatched in order to let them
   spread across a distributed environment.  Such mechanism would allow
   users participating in distributed conferences to avoid knowing the
   transport addresses needed to communicate with remote focus entities,
   and to keep transparently referring to the local focus entity
   instead.

   In order to understand who the actual receiver of a message shall be,
   all messages are intercepted by a logical entity, called Gateway,
   belonging to the XCON focus.  The Gateway will understand whether a
   message is directed to a local entity (e.g. a user belonging to the
   XCON focus, or the local Floor Control Server) or to a remote entity
   belonging to another focus (e.g. a remotely participating user, or a
   remote Floor Control Server).

                Figure 6: Centralized protocols dispatching

   To make the whole thing clearer, the example in figure Figure 7 will
   be used.  As in the previous case, the whole sequence diagram has
   been split in three parts to better help understand all the required
   steps.  In this example, a user (Client (A)) belonging to XCON (A) is
   remotely participating to a distributed conference hosted by XCON
   (B).  Since XCON (B) is physically hosting the conference, floor
   control will be entirely managed by its Floor Control Server.  To
   allow Client (A) to communicate with Floor Control Server (B) and
   viceversa, appropriate dispatching of BFCP messages between the two
   peers will be needed.  We have already seen how labels are assigned
   and swapped: the same labels will be used for dispatching.

   The flow of a typical message exchange can be seen as follows:


   1.  The Client (A) sends a BFCP message to the Floor Control Server;
       the message is intercepted by XCON (A)'s gateway; the label
       assigned to client (A) is retrieved, and used to forward the BFCP
       message to the DCON (A) Dispatcher; of course, since BFCP
       messages are binary, an opportune treatment (e.g. through Base64
       encoding) should be done to encapsulate the message in a text-
       based protocol message (as XDSP will probably be);

   2.  Once DCON (A) receives the encapsulated BFCP message, the labels
       are opportunely swapped (in this case, A=>XYZ) and the message is
       routed to the right destination (DCON (B));

   3.  DCON (B) will receive the message and swap labels again (XYZ=>B);
       at this point, the encapsulated message will be forwarded to the
       underlying XCON (B) Gateway to be further processed there;

   4.  The XCON (B) Gateway will receive the encapsulated (and probably
       Base64-encoded) BFCP message; after decoding it (if needed), the
       Gateway will analyze the label marked in the message (B, in this
       case), and will understand it is a message sent by a remote user
       (Client (A)) to the local Floor Control Server.  It will forward
       the (now 'natively' binary) message there, where it will be
       processed;

   5.  In case the FCS (B) needs to send a message to Client (A),
       exactly the same operations will be performed, and the same path
       will be followed through the needed label swaps among the
       involved peers.  FCS (A), while not actually managing the floors
       related to the remote conference Client (A) is participanting in,
       will however be notified upon each floor status change, so to
       opportunely update the local media mixes when needed (e.g. to
       mute Client (A) excluding her/him from XCON (A)'s local mix if
       FCS (B) has decided so).
