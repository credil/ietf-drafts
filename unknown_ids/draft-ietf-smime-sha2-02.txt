1. Introduction 

   This document specifies the algorithm identifiers and specifies 
   parameters for the message digest algorithms SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-
   384, and SHA-512 for use with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) 
   [RFC3852].  The message digest algorithms are defined in [RFC3874] 
   and [SHA2].  If an implementation chooses to support one of the 
   algorithms discussed in this document, then the implementation MUST 
   do so as described in this document. 

   This document also specifies the algorithm identifier and parameters 
   for use of SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 with DSA, RSA, and 
   ECDSA.  If an implementation chooses to support one of the algorithms 
   discussed in this document, then the implementation MUST do so as 
   described in this document. 

   This document does not define new identifiers; they are taken from 
   [RFC3874], [RFC4055], [ECCADD], [RFC3278], and [RFC3370].  
   Additionally, the parameters follow the conventions specified 
   therein.  Therefore, there is no ASN.1 module included in this 
   document.

   Note that [RFC4231] specifies the conventions for use of for the 
   message authentication code (MAC) algorithms: HMAC with SHA-224, HMAC 
   with SHA-256, HMAC with SHA-384, and HMAC with SHA-512. 

2. Message Digest Algorithms 

   Digest algorithm identifiers are located in the SignedData 
   digestAlgorithms field, the SignerInfo digestAlgorithm field, the 
   DigestedData digestAlgorithm field, and the AuthenticatedData 
   digestAlgorithm field. 

   Digest values are located in the DigestedData digest field and the 
   Message Digest authenticated attribute.  In addition, digest values 
   are input to signature algorithms. 

   In CMS, the digest algorithm identifiers use the AlgorithmIdentifier 
   syntax, which is included here for convenience: 

     AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  { 
       algorithm   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, 
       parameters  ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL  } 

   The algorithm field is discussed in Sections 2.1-2.4 for each message 
   digest algorithm. 

   The following addresses the parameters field: 

   There are two possible encodings for the SHA AlgorithmIdentifier 
   parameters field.  The two alternatives arise from the fact that when 
   the 1988 syntax for AlgorithmIdentifier was translated into the 1997 
   syntax, the OPTIONAL associated with the AlgorithmIdentifier 
   parameters got lost.  Later the OPTIONAL was recovered via a defect 
   report, but by then many people thought that algorithm parameters 
   were mandatory.  Because of this history some implementations encode 
   parameters as a NULL element and others omit them entirely.  The 
   correct encoding is to omit the parameters field; however, 
   implementations MUST also handle a SHA AlgorithmIdentifier parameters 
   field which contains a NULL. 

   The AlgorithmIdentifier parameters field is OPTIONAL.  If present, 
   the parameters field MUST contain a NULL.  Implementations MUST 
   accept SHA2 AlgorithmIdentifiers with absent parameters.  
   Implementations MUST accept SHA2 AlgorithmIdentifiers with NULL 
   parameters.  Implementations SHOULD generate SHA2 
   AlgorithmIdentifiers with absent parameters.

2.1. SHA-224 

   The SHA-224 message digest algorithm is defined in [RFC3874].  The 
   algorithm identifier for SHA-224 is: 

     id-sha224 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
        csor(3) nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 4 } 

   The parameters are as specified in Section 2. 

2.2. SHA-256 

   The SHA-256 message digest algorithm is defined in [SHA2].  The 
   algorithm identifier for SHA-256 is: 

    id-sha256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
        csor(3) nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 1 } 

   The parameters are as specified in Section 2. 

2.3. SHA-384 

   The SHA-384 message digest algorithm is defined in [SHA2].  The 
   algorithm identifier for SHA-384 is: 

     id-sha384 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
       joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101)

3. Signature Algorithms 

   This section specifies the conventions employed by CMS 
   implementations that support DSA [FIPS186-3], ECDSA [X9.62], and RSA 
   [RFC2313] with SHA2 algorithms. 

   Signature algorithm identifiers are located in the SignerInfo 
   signatureAlgorithm field of SignedData.  Also, signature algorithm 
   identifiers are located in the SignerInfo signatureAlgorithm field of 
   countersignature attributes. 

   Signature values are located in the SignerInfo signature field of 
   SignedData.  Also, signature values are located in the SignerInfo 
   signature field of countersignature attributes. 

3.1. DSA 

   NOTE: NIST has not finalized FIPS 186-3 and there is a chance that 
   the draft may be changed.  This may result in differences between 
   what is documented here and what is in the FIPS. 

   [RFC3370] section 3.1 specifies the conventions for DSA with SHA1 
   public key algorithm identifiers, parameters, public keys, and 
   signature values. DSA with SHA2 algorithms use the same conventions 
   for these public key algorithm identifiers, parameters, public keys, 
   and signature values.  DSA MAY be used with SHA-224 and SHA-256. 

   The algorithm identifier for DSA with SHA-224 signature values is: 

     id-dsa-with-sha224 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { joint-iso-ccitt(2) 
       country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) 
       algorithms(4) id-dsa-with-sha2(3) 1 } 

   The algorithm identifier for DSA with SHA-224 signature values is: 

     id-dsa-with-sha256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { joint-iso-ccitt(2) 
       country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) 
       algorithms(4) id-dsa-with-sha2(3) 2 } 

   When either of these algorithm identifiers are used, the 
   AlgorithmIdentifier parameters field MUST be absent. 

3.2. RSA 

   [RFC3370] section 3.2 specifies the conventions for RSA with SHA-1 
   (PKCS #1 v1.5) public key algorithm identifiers, parameters, public 
   keys, and signature values. RSA with SHA2 algorithms use the same

Internet-Draft      Using SHA2 Algorithms with CMS         January 2008 
    

   conventions for these public key algorithm identifiers, parameters, 
   public keys, and signature values.  RSA (PKCS #1 v1.5) MAY be used 
   with SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512. 

   The object identifier for RSA with SHA-224 signature values is: 

     sha224WithRSAEncryption OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) 
       member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-1(1) 14 } 

   The object identifier for RSA with SHA-256 signature values is: 

     sha256WithRSAEncryption  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { iso(1) 
       member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-1(1) 11 } 

   The object identifier for RSA with SHA-384 signature values is: 

     sha384WithRSAEncryption  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { iso(1) 
       member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-1(1) 12 } 

   The object identifier for RSA with SHA-512 signature values is: 

     sha512WithRSAEncryption  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { iso(1) 
       member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-1(1) 13 } 

   When any of these four object identifiers appears within an 
   AlgorithmIdentifier, the parameters MUST be NULL.  Implementations 
   MUST accept the parameters being absent as well as present. 

3.3. ECDSA 

   [RFC3278] section 2.1 specifies the conventions for ECDSA with SHA1 
   public key algorithm identifiers, parameters, public keys, and 
   signature values. ECDSA with SHA2 algorithms use the same conventions 
   for these public key algorithm identifiers, parameters, public keys, 
   and signature values, except that the digestAlgorithm MUST include 
   the corresponding message digest algorithm identifier not sha-1 
   object identifier.  ECDSA MAY be used with SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, 
   or SHA-512. 

   The algorithm identifier for ECDSA with SHA-224 signature values is: 

     ecdsa-with-SHA224 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) 
       us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) signatures(4) ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 1 }

Internet-Draft      Using SHA2 Algorithms with CMS         January 2008 
    

   The algorithm identifier for ECDSA with SHA-256 signature values is: 

     ecdsa-with-SHA256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) 
       us(840)ansi-X9-62(10045) signatures(4) ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 2 } 

   The algorithm identifier for ECDSA with SHA-384 signature values is: 

     ecdsa-with-SHA384 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) 
       us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) signatures(4) ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 3 } 

   The algorithm identifier for ECDSA with SHA-512 signature values is: 

     ecdsa-with-SHA512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) 
       us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) signatures(4) ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 4 } 

   When any of these four object identifiers appears within an 
   AlgorithmIdentifier, the parameters MUST be NULL. 

4. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations in [RFC3278], [RFC3370], [RFC3874], 
   [RFC4055], and [ECCADD] apply. No new security considerations are 
   introduced as a result of this specification. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   None: All identifiers are already registered.  Please remove this 
   section prior to publication as an RFC.
