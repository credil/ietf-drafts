     1. Introduction 

        Network management is typically divided into areas of concerns 
        according to the ISO Telecommunications Management Network 
        model.  The model defines Fault, Configuration, Accounting, 
        Performance, and Security Management.  Notably missing is an 
        area of concern specifically covering energy management at an 
        equal level to these areas. 
         
        With energy becoming a more critical area of concern, this 
        document defines an architecture for power management for use 
        with devices in and connected to communication networks.  This 
        architecture includes monitoring for power state and energy 
        consumption of networked elements, taking into account the 
        requirements specified in [POWER-MON-REQ].  However, this 
        architecture goes one step further, as it includes some elements 
        of elements of configuration.  
         
        Energy management is applicable to devices that comprise and 
        that are connected to a communication network.  Target devices 
        for this specification include (but are not limited to): 
        routers, switches, Power over Ethernet (PoE) endpoints, protocol 
        gateways for building management systems, intelligent meters, 
        home energy gateway, hosts and servers, sensor proxy, etc.   
         
        Where applicable, monitoring of a device is extended to the 
        individual components of the device and/or to any attached 
        dependent device(s).  An example of such a case could be when a 
        device contains components that are independent from a power 
        state point of view (such as line cards, processor cards, hard 
        drives) or when a devices has dependent attached devices (such 
        as a switch with PoE endpoints or a power distribution unit with 
        attached endpoints).

     2. Uses Cases & Requirements 

        The requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking 
        devices are specified in [POWER-MON-REQ].  The requirements in 
        [POWER-MON-REQ] cover devices that typically make up a 
        communications network such as switches, routers, and various 
        connected endpoints.  For power monitoring to be useful, a 
        specification should also be applicable to facility meters, 
        power distribution units, gateway proxies for commercial 
        building control, home automation devices and devices that 
        interface with the utility and/or smart grid.  Due to this fact, 
        the scope of this architecture is broader than that specified in 
        [POWER-MON-REQ].  Several scenarios that cover these broader use 
        cases are presented later in Section 9.  - Implementation 
        Scenarios. 
         
     3. Terminology 

        This section contains definitions of major terms used in 
        explaining the concepts, examples, and the MIB definitions. 
      
         
        Power Monitor 
         
        A Power Monitor is a system of one or more components that 
        provide power, draws power, or reports energy consumption on 
        behalf of another Power Monitor.  It can be independently 
        managed from a power monitoring and power state configuration 
        point of view.  Examples of Power Monitors are: a router line 
        card, a motherboard with a CPU, an IP phone connected with a 
        switch, etc. 
         
         
        Power Monitor Parent 
         
        A Power Monitor Parent is a Power Monitor that is the root of 
        one or multiple subtending Power Monitors, called Power Monitor 
        Children.  The Power Monitor Parent is able to report the power 
        state and energy consumption for his Power Monitor Child(ren).   
        For example, in case of Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) device such as 
        an IP phone or an access point attached to a switch port, the 
        switch is the source of power for the attached device.  In such 
        a case, the Power Monitor Parent is the port of the switch, 
        while the attached device is the Power Monitor Child.   
         
         
        Power Monitor Child 
          
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires March 17, 2011            [Page 5] 
         
     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>    Sept 2010 
      
        A Power Monitor Child is a Power Monitor associated to a Power 
        Monitor Parent, which draws power from its Power Monitor Parent 
        or reports its power usage and power state to its Power Monitor 
        Parent. 
         
         
        Power Monitor Meter Domain 
         
        A Power Monitor Meter Domain is a name or name space that 
        logically groups together Power Monitors that comprises a zone 
        of manageable power usage.  Typically, this will comprise all 
        Power Monitors that are powered from the same electrical panel 
        or panels for which there is a meter or sub meter.  For example, 
        all Power Monitors receiving power from the same distribution 
        panel of a building, or all Power Monitors in a building for 
        which there is one main meter.  From the point of monitoring 
        power use, it is useful to report the total power usage as the 
        sum of power consumed by all the Power Monitors within a Power 
        Monitor Meter Domain and then correlate that value to the 
        metered usage.  
         
         
        Power Level 
         
        A uniform way to classify power settings on a Power Monitor 
        (e.g., shut, hibernate, sleep, high).  Power Levels can be 
        viewed as an interface for interacting with the underlying 
        device implemented power settings.  
         
         
        Manufacturer Power Level 
         
        A device specific way to classify power settings implemented on 
        a Power Monitor.  For cases where the implemented power setting 
        cannot be directly mapped to a Power Level(s), the Manufacturer 
        Power Levels are used to enumerate and show the relationship 
        between the implemented power settings and the Power Level 
        interface. 
         
         
     4. Architecture High Level Concepts and Scope 

        The scope of this architecture is to enable networking and 
        network attached devices to be managed with respect to their 
        energy consumption or production.  The goal is to make devices 
        energy aware.  
         

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires March 17, 2011            [Page 6] 
         
     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>    Sept 2010 
      
        The architecture describes how to make a device aware of its 
        consumption or production of energy expressed as usage in watts. 
        This does not include: 
          
        - Manufacturing costs in currency or environmental units 
        - Embedded carbon or environmental equivalences of the device 
        itself 
        - Cost in currency or environmental impact to dismantle or 
        recycle the device 
        - Relationship to an electrical or smart grid 
        - Supply chain analysis 
        - Conversion of the usage or production of energy to units 
        expressed from the source of that energy - for example the 
        greenhouse gas emissions associated with 1000kW from a diesel 
        source. 
         
        This remainder of this section will go over the basic concepts 
        of the architecture.  Each concept is then listed with notable 
        descriptions in subsequent sections.  
         
        Examples will be provided in a later section to show how these 
        concepts can be fulfilled in an implementation.  
         
        Given a Power Monitor, we can describe the information about the 
        Power Monitor through various data.  A Power Monitor will have 
        basic naming and informational descriptors to identify it in the 
        network. 
         
        A Power Monitor can be part of a Power Monitor Meter Domain.  A 
        Power Monitor Meter Domain is a manageable set of devices that 
        has a meter or sub-meter attached and typically corresponds to a 
        power distribution point or panel.  
         
        A Power Monitor can be a parent (Power Monitor Parent) or child 
        (Power Monitor Child) of another Power Monitor.  This allows for 
        devices to aggregate reporting and/or control of power 
        information. 
         
        Each Power Monitor can have information to allow it to be 
        described in the context of the business or ultimate use.  This 
        is in addition to its networked information.  This allows for 
        tagging, grouping and differentiation between Power Monitors for 
        NMS. 
         
        For control and universal monitoring each Power Monitor will 
        implement or declare a set of known Power Levels.  The Power 
        Levels can be mapped to Manufacturer Power Levels that indicate 
        the specific power setting for the device implementing the Power 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires March 17, 2011            [Page 7]

        Monitor, in case that Power Monitor doesn't implement yet the 
        standard Power Levels [POWER-MON-MIB]. 
         
        The desired Power Level variable is set, when setting the Power 
        Level.  If the Power Monitor is busy at the request time, it 
        might update the actual Power Level when his priority task is 
        finished.  This mechanism implies two different Power Level 
        variables: actual versus desired.  
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: the transition state will have to be specified. 
      
        Each Power Monitor will have usage information that describes 
        the power information along with how that usage was obtained or 
        derived. 
         
        Optionally a Power Monitor can further describe the power 
        information with power quality information reflecting the 
        electrical characteristics of the measurement. 
         
        Optionally a Power Monitor can provide power usage over time to 
        describe energy consumption 
         
        If a Power Monitor has one or more batteries, it can provide 
        optional Battery information as well. 
      

     4.1. Power Monitor Information 

        Every Power Monitor SHOULD have a unique printable name, and 
        MUST have a unique Power Monitor index.  
         
        Possible naming conventions are: textual DNS name, MAC-address 
        of the device, interface ifName, or a text string uniquely 
        identifying the Power Monitor.  As an example, in the case of IP 
        phones, the Power Monitor name can be the device DNS name.  
      

     4.2. Power Monitor Meter Domain 

        Each Power Monitor MUST be a member of a Power Monitor Meter 
        Domain.  The Power Monitor Meter Domain SHOULD map 1-1 with a 
        metered or sub-metered portion of the site.  The Power Monitor 
        Meter Domain MUST be configured on the Power Monitor Parent.  
        The Power Monitor Children MAY inherit its domain value from the 
        Power Monitor Parent or the Power Monitor Meter Domain MAY be 
        configured directly in Power Monitor Child.

     4.3. Power Monitor Parent and Child 

        A Power Monitor can be connected to another Power Monitor and 
        either draw power from that entity or report power usage to that 
        entity. 
         
        A Power Monitor Child can be fully dependent on the Power 
        Monitor Parent (as in the case of Power Over Ethernet) or 
        independent from the parent (such as a PC connected to a 
        switch).  In the dependent case, the Power Monitor Parent 
        provides power for the Power Monitor Child (the PoE case).  In 
        the independent case, the Power Monitor Child draws power from 
        another source (typically a wall outlet).  Since the Power 
        Monitor Parent is not the source of power supply, the power 
        usage cannot be measured at the Power Monitor Parent.  However, 
        an independent Power Monitor Child may report Power Monitor 
        information to the Power Monitor Parent.  The Power Monitor 
        Child may listen to the power control settings from a Power 
        Monitor Parent and could react to the control messages.  Note 
        that the communication between the Power Monitor Parent and 
        Power Monitor Child is out of scope of this document. 
         
        A Power Monitor cannot be at the same time a Power Monitor 
        Parent and a Power Monitor Child.  Indeed such configuration 
        would lead to double counting the energy consumed within a 
        specific Power Monitor Domain. 
         
        A mechanism, outside of the scope of this document, should be in 
        place to verify the connectivity between the Power Monitor 
        Parent and its Power Monitor Children.  If the Power Monitor 
        Child is unavailable, the Power Monitor Parent must follow some 
        rules to determine how long it should wait before removing the 
        Power Monitor Child entry, along with all associated statistics, 
        from his database.  In some situations, such as connected 
        building, in which the Power Monitor Children are pretty static, 
        this removal timer might be pretty long.  The persistence across 
        a Power Monitor Parent reload could even make sense.  However, 
        in a networking environment, where endpoints could come and go, 
        there is not much sense to configure a long removal timer.  In 
        all cases, the removal timer or persistence must be clearly 
        specified.

        implementations are provided in the Implementation Scenarios 
        section.

     4.4. Power Monitor Context 

        Monitored power will ultimately be collected to and reported 
        from a NMS.  In order to aid in the reporting and 
        differentiation between Power Monitors, each Power Monitor will 
        contain information to establish a business or site context.  
        A Power Monitor can provide an importance value in the range of 
        1..100 to help differentiate the use or relative value to the 
        site.  The importance range is from 1 (least important) to 100 
        (most important).  The default importance value is 1.   
         
        For example, a typical office environment has several types of 
        phones, which can be rated according to the business impact: a 
        public desk phone has a lower importance (for example, 10) than 
        a business-critical emergency phone (for example, 100).  As 
        another example, a company can consider that a PC and a phone 
        for a customer-service engineer is more important than a PC and 
        a phone for lobby use.  
        Although network managers must establish their own ranking the 
        following is a broad recommendation: 
              
          . 90 to 100 Emergency response  
          . 80 to 90 Executive or business critical  
          . 70 to 79 General or Average  
          . 60 to 69 Staff or support  
          . 40 to 59 Public or guest  
          . 1  to 39 Decorative or hospitality 
      
        A Power Monitor can provide a set of keywords.  These keywords 
        are a list of tags that can be used for grouping and summary 
        reporting within or between Power Monitor Meter Domains.  All 
        alphanumeric characters and symbols such as #, (, $, !, and & 
        are allowed.  Potential examples are: IT, lobby, HumanResources, 
        Accounting, StoreRoom, CustomerSpace, router, phone, floor2, or 
        SoftwareLab.  There is no default value for the keyword. 
         
        Multiple keywords can be assigned to a device.  In such cases, 
        the keywords are separated by commas and no spaces between 
        keywords are allowed.  For example, "HR,Bldg1,Private". 
         
        Additionally, a Power Monitor can provide a "role description" 
        string that indicates the purpose the Power Monitor serves in 
        the network or to site/business.  This could be a string 
        describing the context the device fulfils in deployment.  For 
        example, a lighting fixture in a kitchen area could have a role 
        of "Hospitality Lighting" to provide context for the use of the 
        device.

     4.5. Power Monitor Levels 

        Power Levels represent universal states of power management of a 
        Power Monitor.  Each Power Level corresponds to a global, 
        system, and performance state in the ACPI model. 
         
         
                Level        ACPI Global/System      Name 
                                    State 
         
        Non-operational states: 
         
                  1               G3, S5           Mech Off 
                  2               G2, S5           Soft Off 
                  3               G1, S4           Hibernate 
                  4               G1, S3           Sleep  
                  5               G1, S2           Standby 
                  6               G1, S1           Ready  
         
        Operational states: 
                  7               G0, S0, P5       LowMinus 
                  8               G0, S0, P4       Low 
                  9               G0, S0, P3       MediumMinus 
                 10               G0, S0, P2       Medium 
                 11               G0, S0, P1       HighMinus 
                 12               G0, S0, P0       High   
         
        For example, a Power Monitor with a Power Level of 9 would 
        indicate an operational state with MediumMinus Power Level. 
         
        The Power Levels can be considered as guidelines for an 
        interface in order to promote interoperability across device 
        types.  Realistically, it is foreseen that each specific feature 
        requiring Power Levels will require a complete recommendation of 
        its own.  For example, designing IP phones with consistent Power 
        Levels across vendors requires a specification for IP phone 
        design, along with the Power Levels mapping. 
         
        In some situation, Manufacturer Power Levels are required, for 
        example, when no mappings with the existing Power Levels are 
        possible or when more levels than the twelve specified Power 
        Levels are required.   
        A first example would be an imaginary device type, with only 
        five levels: "none", "short", "tall", "grande", and "venti".  
         
          Manufacturer Power Level     Respective Name

               4                           venti 
         
        In the unlikely event of no possible mapping between these 
        Manufacturer Power Levels and the Power Levels, the Power Level 
        will remain 0 throughout the MIB module, as displayed below.   
         
           Power Level / Name       Manufacturer Power Level / Name 
               0 / unknown              0 / none 
               0 / unknown              1 / short 
               0 / unknown              2 / tall 
               0 / unknown              3 / grande 
               0 / unknown              4 / venti 
                      
        If a mapping between the Manufacturer Power Levels and the Power 
        Levels is achievable, both series of levels exist in the MIB 
        module, allowing the NMS to understand the mapping between them 
        by correlating the Power Level with the Manufacturer Power 
        Levels. 
         
           Power Level / Name       Manufacturer Power Level / Name 
               1 / Mech Off             0 / none 
               2 / Soft Off             0 / none 
               3 / Hibernate            0 / none 
               4 / Sleep, Save-to-RAM   0 / none 
               5 / Standby              0 / none 
               6 / Ready                1 / short 
               7 / LowMinus             1 / short 
               8 / Low                  1 / short 
               9 / MediumMinus          2 / tall 
               10 / Medium              2 / tall 
               11 / HighMinus           3 / grande 
               12 / High                4 / venti 
      
        How the Power Monitor Levels are then mapped, i.e. assigning the 
        directly lower or directly higher level, is an implementation 
        choice.  However, its recommended that the Manufacturer Power 
        Levels l maps to the directly lower Power Level, so that setting 
        all Power Meters to a Power Level would be conservative in terms 
        of disabled functionality on the Power Monitor implementing the 
        Manufacturer Power Levels. 
         
        A second example would be a device type, such as a dimmer or a 
        motor, with a high number of operational levels.  For the sake 
        of the example, 100 operational states are assumed.

     4.6. Power Monitor Usage Measurement 

        For a Power Monitor, RMS (Root Mean Square) or RMS equivalent 
        (for example, after conversion to DC power) power usage must be 
        reported, including the magnitude of measurement, as multiple 
        scaling factors can be used.  
        The power usage measurement should conform to the IEC 61850 
        definition of unit multiplier for the SI (System International) 
        units of measure.  The power usage measurement is considered an 
        instantaneous usage value and does not include the usage over 
        time.   
        Measured values are represented in SI units obtained by 
        BaseValue * 10 raised to the power of scale.  For example, if 
        current power usage of a Power Monitor is 3, it could be 3 W, 3 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires March 17, 2011           [Page 13] 
         
     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>    Sept 2010 
      
        mW, 3 KW, 3 MW depending on the value of scaling factor (called 
        pmPowerUnitMultiplier in the MIB module).   
                                         
        In addition to knowing the usage and magnitude it is useful to 
        know how a Power Monitor usage measurement was obtained:  
          . whether the measurements were made at the device itself or 
             from a remote source   
          . Description of the method that was used to measure the 
             power and can distinguish actual or estimated values.  
              
        An NMS can use this information to account for the accuracy and 
        nature of the reading between different implementations.   
         
        In addition to the power usage the nameplate power rating of a 
        Power Monitor is typically specified by the vendor as the 
        capacity required to power the device.  Often this label is a 
        conservative number and is the worst-case power draw.  While the 
        actual utilization of an entity can be lower, the nameplate 
        power is important for provisioning, capacity planning and 
        billing.   
      

     4.7. Optional Power Usage Quality 

        Given a power measurement of a Power Monitor, it may in certain 
        circumstances be desirable to know the power quality associated 
        with that measurement.  The information model must adhere to the 
        IEC 61850 7-2 standard to describe AC measurements.  In some 
        Power Monitor Domains, the power quality may not be needed, 
        available, nor relevant to the Power Monitor.   
      

     4.8. Optional Energy Measurement 

        In addition to reporting the Power Level, an approach to 
        characterize the energy demand is required.  It is well known in 
        commercial electrical utility rates, that demand charges can be 
        on par with actual power charges.  So, it is useful to 
        characterize the demand.  The demand can be described as the 
        average energy of an Power Monitor over a time window, called a 
        demand interval, typically 15 minutes.  The highest peak energy 
        demand measured over a time horizon, say 1 month or 1 year is 
        often the basis for usage charges.  A single window of time of 
        high usage can penalize the energy consumption charges.  
        However, it is relevant to measure the demand only when there 
        are actual power measurements from a Power Monitor, and not when 
        the power measurement is assumed or predicted.    
         
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires March 17, 2011           [Page 14] 
         
     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>    Sept 2010 
      
        Several efficiency metrics can be derived and tracked with the 
        demand usage data.   
         
          . For example, per-packet power costs for a networking device 
             (router or switch) can be calculated by an network 
             management system.  The packets count can be determined 
             from the traffic usage in the ifTable [RFC2863] from the 
             forwarding plane figure, or from the platform 
             specifications. 
              
          . Watt-hour power can be combined with utility energy sources 
             to estimate carbon footprint and other emission statistics. 
      

     4.9. Optional Battery Information 

        Some Power Monitors might be running on batteries.  Therefore 
        information such as the battery status (charging or 
        discharging), remaining capacity, etc... must be available. 
      

     5. Power Monitor Children Discovery 

        There are multiple ways that the Power Monitor Parent can 
        discover its Power Monitor Children, if not present on the same 
        physical network element. 
         
          . In case of PoE, the Power Monitor Parent automatically 
             discovers that a Power Monitor Child requests some power. 
          . The Power Monitor Parent and Children may run the Link 
             Layer Discovery Protocol [LLDP], or any proprietary similar 
             protocols such as Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP).  The 
             Power Monitor Parent might even support the LLDP-MED MIB 
             [LLDP-MED-MIB], which returns some extra information on the 
             Power Monitor Children.  
          . The Power Monitor Parent might reside on a network 
             connected facilities gateway.  A typical example is a 
             converged building gateway, monitoring several other 
             devices in the building, doing the proxy between SNMP and a 
             protocol such as BACNET.  
              
        When a Power Monitor Child doesn't support the Power Levels, but 
        its own Manufacturer Power Levels, the Power Monitor Parent will 
        have to discover those Manufacturer Power Levels.  Note that the 
        communication specifications between the Power Monitor Parent 
        and Children is out of the scope of this document.  This 
        includes the Manufacturer Power Levels discovery, which is 
        protocol-specific.

     6. Configuration 

        This power management architecture allows the configuration of a 
        couple of key parameters: 
         
          . Power Monitor name: an unique printable name for the Power 
             Monitor.  
          . Power Monitor Role: an administratively assigned name to 
             indicate the purpose a Power Monitor serves in the network.  
          . Power Monitor Importance: a ranking of how important the 
             Power Monitor is on a scale of 1 to 100 compared to other 
             Power Monitors in the same Power Monitor Meter Domain.  
          . Power Monitor Keywords: a list of keywords that can be used 
             to group Power Monitors for reporting or searching. 
          . Power Monitor Domain: specifies the name of a Power Monitor 
             Meter Domain for the Power Monitor. 
          . The Power Monitor Level: specifies the current Power Level 
             (0..12) for the Power Monitor.  
          . Manufacturer Power Level and name 
          . The energy demand parameters: for example, which interval 
             length to report the energy on, the number of interval to 
             keep, etc... 
         
        Interactions with established open protocols such as Wake-up-on-
        Lan (WoL) and DASH [DASH] may require configuration in the Power 
        Monitor as well, facilitating the communication between Power 
        Monitor Parent and remote Power Monitor Children. 
         
        Note that the communication specifications between the Power 
        Monitor Parent and Children is out of the scope of this 
        document.  This includes the communication of the power settings 
        and configuration information such as the Power Monitor Domain. 
         
         
     7. Fault Management 

        [POWER-MON-REQ] specifies some requirements about power states 
        such as "the current state - the time of the last change", "the 
        total time spent in each state", "the number of transitions to 
        each state", etc...  Such requirements are fulfilled via the 
        pmPowerLevelChange NOTIFICATION-TYPE [POWER-MON-MIB].  This SNMP 
        notification is generated when the value(s) of Power Level has 
        changed for the Power Monitor.

        A push based mechanism such as IPFIX might be required to export 
        high volume time series of energy consumption values, as 
        mentioned in [POWER-MON-REQ]. 
         
         
     8. Relationship with Other Standard Development Organizations 

     8.1. Information Modeling  

        This power management architecture should reuse as much as 
        possible existing standard efforts and not re-invent something 
        new, specifically in terms of information modeling and data 
        modeling [RFC3444].  
         
        The data model for power, energy related objects is based on the  
        IEC 61850.   
         
        Specific examples include: 
         
          . The scaling factor, which represent the magnitude of Power 
             Monitor usage, conforms to the IEC 61850 definition of unit 
             multiplier for the SI (System International) units of 
             measure.  
         
          . The power accuracy model is based on the ANSI and IEC 
             Standards, which require that we use an accuracy class for 
             power measurement.  ANSI and IEC define the following 
             accuracy classes for power measurement:  
           
             . IEC 62053-22  60044-1 class 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1  3.    
             
             . ANSI C12.20 class 0.2, 0.5 
           
          . The powerQualityMIB MIB module adheres closely to the IEC 
             61850 7-2 standard to describe AC measurements.   
         
      
     8.2. Power Levels 

        There are twelve Power Monitor Levels; divided into six 
        operational states, and six non-operational states.  The lowest 
        non-operational state is 1 and the highest is six.  Each non-
        operational state corresponds to an ACPI level [ACPI].

     9. Implementation Scenarios 

        The scope of power and energy monitoring consists of devices 
        that consume power within and connected to a communications 
        network.  These devices include: 
         
        - Network devices and sub-components: devices such as routers 
        and switches and their sub-components. 
         
        - Network attached endpoints: devices that use the 
        communications network such as endpoints, PCs, or facility 
        gateways that proxy energy monitor and control for commercial 
        buildings or home automation,  
         
        - Network attached meters or supplies: devices that can monitor 
        the electrical supply such as smart meters or Universal Power 
        Supplies (UPS) that meter and provide availability.  
        This section provides illustrative examples that model different 
        scenarios for implementation of the Power Monitor including 
        Power Monitor Parent and Power Monitor Child relationships. 
         
        Each of the scenarios below is explained in more details in the 
        Power Monitor MIB document [POWER-MON-MIB], with a mapping to 
        the MIB Objects. 
         

     Scenario 1: Switch with PoE endpoints  

        Consider a PoE IP phone connected to a switch, as displayed on 
        figure 1.  The IP phone draws power from the PoE switch.   
      

     Scenario 2: Switch with PoE endpoints with further connected 
        device(s)  

        Consider the same scenario as example 1 with an IP phone 
        connected to PoE port of a switch.  Now, in addition, a PC is 
        also daisy-chained from the IP phone for LAN connectivity.  The 
        phone draws power from PoE port of the switch, while the PC 
        draws power from the wall outlet.  
      

     Scenario 3: A switch with Wireless Access Points 

        Consider a Wireless Access Point connected to the PoE port of a 
        switch.  There are several PCs connected to the Wireless Access 
        Point over Wireless protocols.  All PCs draw power from the wall 
        outlets.  
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires March 17, 2011           [Page 18] 
         
     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>    Sept 2010 
      
         
        The switch port is the Power Monitor Parent for the Wireless 
        Access Point (WAP) and the PCs.  There is a distinction, between 
        the Power Monitor Children, as the WAP draws power from the PoE 
        port of the switch and the PCs draw power from the wall outlet.  
         

     Scenario 4: Network connected facilities gateway 

        At the top of the network hierarchy of a building network is a 
        gateway device that can perform protocol conversion between many 
        facility management devices, such as BACNET, MODBUS, DALI, LON,  
        etc.  There are power meters associated with power consuming 
        entities (Heating Ventilation & Air Conditioning - HVAC, 
        lighting, electrical, fire control, elevators, etc).  The 
        proposed MIB can be implemented on the gateway device.  The 
        gateway can be considered as the Power Monitor Parent, while the 
        power meters associated with the energy consuming entities such 
        can be considered as Power Monitor Children.   
      

     Scenario 5: Data Center Network 

        A typical data center network consists of a hierarchy of 
        switches.  At the bottom of hierarchy there are servers mounted 
        on a rack, and those are connected to the top of the rack 
        switches.  The top switches are connected to aggregation 
        switches that are in turn connected to core switches.  As an 
        example, Server 1 and Server 2 are connected to different switch 
        ports of the top switch.  
         
        The proposed MIB can be implemented on the switches.  The switch 
        can be considered as the Power Monitor Parent.  The servers can 
        be considered as the Power Monitor Children.  
         
     Scenario 6: Building Gateway Device 

        Similar scenario as the scenario 4. 
         
         
     Scenario 7: Power Consumption of UPS 

        Data centers and commercial buildings can have Uninterruptible 
        Power Supplies (UPS) connected to the network. The Power Monitor 
        can be used to model a UPS as a Power Monitor Parent with the 
        connected devices as Power Monitor Children.
