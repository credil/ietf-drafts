    <abstract>
      <t>The existing SIP identity mechanism (RFC4474) creates a signature
      over the SIP body, including the entire SDP. As part of their normal
      operation, Session Border Controllers (SBCs) and SIP Back-to-Back User
      Agents (B2BUAs) modify various fields in the SDP which breaks that
      signature.</t>

      <t>This document defines a new identity mechanism which operates with
      SBCs and B2BUAs. This new identity mechanism creates a signature over
      certain SIP headers and certain SDP lines, and uses both SIP signaling
      and the media path to perform its identity function.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC4474">SIP Identity</xref> provides cryptographic
      identity for SIP requests. It provides this protection by signing
      certain SIP header fields (Contact, Date, Call-ID, CSeq, To, and From)
      and the SIP message body. The SIP message body typically contains the
      SDP.</t>

      <t>In cases where the originating, authenticating domain directly
      connect to the terminating, validating domain, RFC4474 has questionable
      value. The reason is that in such cases TLS can simply be used for the
      communication between the edge proxies of each domain, which not only
      provides additional security properties (e.g., encryption), but is also
      more efficient and protects all signaling messages. The real value of
      RFC4474 lies in cases where SIP signaling crosses multiple domains,
      belonging to different organizations. Unfortunately, in the presence of
      SBCs or B2BUAs that are in a different trust domain than the calling
      party or called party, SIP Identity provides the same security
      properties as using <xref target="RFC3325">P-Asserted-Identity</xref>
      between those same trust domains, if it succeeds at all. In most cases
      it would probably fail, and force the UAC to re-send its request without
      any Identity mechanism if it wanted to establish communication.</t>

      <t>The mechanism described in this document provides cryptographic
      assurance of the endpoint's identity by signing certain SIP headers,
      much like RFC4474. However, unlike RFC4474 which signs the entire SDP,
      the mechanism described in this document signs only certain SDP
      attributes, and not all the same SIP headers. The remote endpoint is
      expected to validate the signature over the SIP headers and specified
      SDP attributes, to initiate a proof of possession test over the media
      path, which proves the session has been established with the "From:"
      party in the SIP header. Mechanisms to perform this proof of possession
      are shown using DTLS and using a small extension to <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice">ICE</xref>. This mechanism is also
      extensible, in order to be usable by future mechanisms which need signed
      SDP attributes</t>

      <t>Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with RFC4474,
      "Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session
      Initiation Protocol (SIP)", which defines the Identity and Identity-Info
      header fields. A future version of this document will have less reliance
      on RFC4474.</t>

    <section title="Analysis of SIP-Identity with SBCs">
      <t>This section examines how <xref target="RFC4474">SIP Identity</xref>
      operates with SBCs(<xref target="sip-identity-with-sbc"></xref>) or
      certain back-to-back user-agents (B2BUAs), and how SIP Identity uses
      transport addresses as identifiers (<xref
      target="transport-address-identifier"></xref>).</t>

      <section anchor="sip-identity-with-sbc" title="SIP-Identity with SBCs">
        <t>After an authorization agent signs a SIP request, the SIP request
        traverses SBC(s) operated by other trust domains and finally arrives
        at the destination domain. If all of those intervening SBCs support
        SIP Identity, those SBCs will validate the request's signature,
        destroy the existing signature, create a new identity for the request,
        and sign the request's new identity. These necessary SBC actions
        (described in detail below) provide the same identity assurance as
        using P-Asserted-Identity between trust domains.</t>

        <t>The functions of SBCs, and why they do what they do, is mainly
        detailed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipping-sbc-funcs"></xref>.
        Regardless of the architectural implications of their actions, the
        fact is their functions are often performed as a SIP request/response
        traverses across SIP domains. Other B2BUAs in the path sometimes also
        perform functions which invalidate an RFC4474 signature. With regard
        to RFC4474, the SBC functions which impact the signature are:</t>

                title="Two Service Providers with SBCs Between Two Enterprises">
          <preamble>The following diagram shows two service providers (SP1 and
          SP2), and each has an SBC at the edge of their respective networks.
          Each of these SBCs would rewrite the IP addresses in the SDP. There
          may be an SBC in the Enterprise as well, however that SBC would own
          the appropriate Enterprise domain certificate and re-sign the
          request, and thus logically appear as the Enterprise User
          Agent</preamble>

        </figure>

        <t>Enterprise-A can populate the "From:" address in its SIP requests
        using E.164 telephone numbers (e.g.,
        'sip:+17005551008@example.com;user=phone') or using a SIP URI (e.g.,
        'sip:john.doe@example.com'). The characteristics of each choice, as
        the message traverses the SBCs operated by another administrative
        domain (service providers) are described below:</t>

        <section title="Validate the Signature">
          <t>Per RFC4474, the SBC would validate the incoming SIP request.
          This requires a public key operation to be performed against the SIP
          request.</t>

          <t>[[computationally expensive. Will use TLS or IPSEC instead
          (doesn't require public key operation for every SIP request), or
          will rely on ACLs or a dedicated link or dedicated network.]]</t>

          <t>This creates a natural incentive for the service providers to use
          transitive trust between themselves, rather than RFC4474, due to the
          computational expense of the per-call public key operations on each
          SIP request. For similar reasons, there is a natural incentive for
          the service providers to not even validate an enterprise's RFC4474
          signature but rather to rely on a contract or rely on TLS or IPSEC
          to ensure the SIP signaling originated from the enterprise. Since
          service providers do not allow Enterprises to be transitive domains,
          they only allow From-URI domains of the enterprise, and thus do not
          need a per-request 4474-style signature from the Enterprise at the
          first ingress hop.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Destroy Existing Signature">
          <t>SBCs and B2BUAs typically modify the media transport addresses
          and thus invalidate the RFC4474 signature. This prevents downstream
          systems from validating original signature.</t>

          <t>Because the original signature is invalidated by the first SBC,
          no other network (SP2 nor Enterprise-B) can validate the original
          signature. This means all downstream entities (in the example above,
          SP2 and Enterprise-B) are relying wholly on SP1 to validate the
          signature. This creates transitive trust which is undesirable - a
          single bad actor or compromised system anywhere along the path can
          compromise the entire identity system. Note this does not require
          malicious intent within the trust domain - a weak or mis-configured
          entry point into the trust chain of service providers compromises
          the entire trust chain.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Create New Identity">
          <t>In order to generate a SIP Identity signature (in the next step),
          the SBC requires the private key associated with the domain of that
          From: address. Because the SBC and the initiator of the SIP request
          are different entities, it is unlikely the SBC will possess the
          initiating domain's private key. Thus, the SBC will have to create a
          new identity -- using its domain -- for the request, if it wants to
          provide RFC4474.</t>

          <t>The new identity creates difficulties with downstream whitelists,
          call routing, and reputation systems. For example, downstream
          systems may sometimes see the identity +14085551212@example.com when
          the request is routed through certain SBCs, and may see a different
          identity, +14085551212@example.net, when the request is routed
          through different SBCs. Such different routing might be done due to
          network outages or for cost savings (e.g., evening rates). Due to
          these different identities, the domain name no longer has much
          meaning -- for E.164 telephone numbers, the user-part becomes the
          entire identity. In some sense that's appropriate; if the user-part
          is truly a global-scope E.164 number, then the domain portion is
          essentially meaningless. It might as well have been a tel-URI,
          except that making it a SIP-URI is more common and allows rfc4474 to
          be used.</t>

          <t>A SBC might receive an identity containing an E.164 phone number
          or containing a SIP URI. When forming a new identity, the SBC
          performs different steps for each of those cases:</t>

          <t><list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="E.164 telephone numbers:"><vspace
              blankLines="0" />The SBC would remove the original domain name
              and substitute its own domain on the right-hand side.</t>

              <t hangText="SIP URIs:"><vspace blankLines="0" />Unlike E.164
              telephone numbers, the SBC is not able to simply substitute its
              domain name for the enterprise's domain name due to user-part
              name collisions. There is only one unappealing solution: use the
              so-called escape-hack from email. For example, the SBC could
              rewrite sip:john.doe@example.com to
              sip:john.doe%example.com@sp1.example.net.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section title="Sign the New Identity">
          <t>Finally, the SBC will sign the new identity, using the private
          key associated with the new identity. This private key is known to
          the SBC (because it is the SBC's domain name). This function incurs
          a public key operation for that SIP request.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="transport-address-identifier"
               title="Transport Address as Identifier">
        <t>SIP Identity signs the SDP so that the IP address (contained in the
        SDP) provides identity. From <xref target="RFC4474"></xref>:</t>

        <t><list style="empty">
            <t>"This mechanism also provides a signature over the bodies of
            SIP requests. The most important reason for doing so is to protect
            Session Description Protocol (SDP) bodies carried in SIP requests.
            There is little purpose in establishing the identity of the user
            that originated a SIP request if this assurance is not coupled
            with a comparable assurance over the media descriptors."</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>RFC4474 ties an identifier (IP address) with the identity (SIP
        "From:" address), which is counter to ongoing efforts in the IETF to
        split identifiers from identity (e.g., <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-hip-base"> </xref>, <xref
        target="I-D.farinacci-lisp"></xref>, <xref
        target="I-D.carpenter-idloc-map-cons"></xref>, <xref
        target="I-D.whittle-ivip-arch"></xref>).</t>

        <t>The presence of media relays (e.g., <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn">TURN</xref>), which may be used by an
        attacker, means that relying exclusively on such identifiers is risky.
        For example, if an attacker were able to cause re-use of the (signed)
        transport address within the replay window, the attacker can
        successfully impersonate the identity.</t>

        <t>Additionally, RFC4474's tying of identities to IP address causes a
        failure in certain NAT scenarios when the source transport address of
        arriving media does not agree with the SDP. While not written down in
        a standard at this time, if both endpoints are using <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice">ICE</xref>, the ICE username and password
        (sent in SDP and signed by RFC4474) can be reliably used to establish
        identity. However, if either endpoint does not support ICE, the
        arriving media will be considered fraudulent because the arriving
        media does not match with the RFC4474-signed SDP.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Operation">
      <t>The operation of SIP-Identity-Media is similar to RFC4474 and uses
      authentication service proxies much like RFC4474. The basic steps
      are:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>A new header, Identity-Media, is created containing the names of
          certain SDP attributes from SDP bodyparts, and containing a hash of
          non-SDP bodyparts.</t>

          <t>Several SIP headers and the Identity-Media header are all signed
          (as detailed in <xref target="identity_media_signature"></xref>),
          and the result is placed in Identity-Media-Signature.</t>

          <t>The receiving domain validates the signature, and if the request
          is an invitation to establish a media channel, performs a proof of
          identity validation using DTLS, TLS, ICE, or HIP over the media
          path.</t>

          header, Identity-Media, containing certain attribute names from the
          SDP (e.g., "a=fingerprint", "a=ice-pub-key"). The authentication
          service then creates a signature over certain SIP headers (e.g.,
          From, To) and this new Identity-Media header. The resulting
          signature is inserted into the new Identity-Media-Signature header.
          An Identity-Info header is added, pointing to this domain's
          certificate. The INVITE, with these additional headers, is forwarded
          to the next administrative domain. <vspace blankLines="0" /> [NOTE:
          alternatively, we could allow the UAC to create the Identity- Media
          header with the attributes it wants signed, then have the auth
          server sign them and insert the signature header - this would be
          more flexible]</t>

          <t>The next administrative domain has an SBC (or B2BUA). The SBC
          modifies or rewrites certain SDP fields. Most typically an SBC will
          modify the "m" and "c" lines. These modifications do not break the
          signature, so long as the SBC doesn't remove the headers
          Identity-Media, Identity-Media-Signature, or Identity-Info, and do
          not remove or alter the signed attributes from the SDP.</t>

          <t>The terminating endpoint's authentication service receives the
          INVITE. It validates that the signature contained in the
          Identity-Media-Signature header, and validates that the signing
          certificate is owned by the originating domain from step 2. This
          validation is done by using the certificate pointed to in the
          Identity-Info header, which MUST match the domain in the From:
          address.</t>

          <t>If the validation was successful, the terminating endpoint's
          authentication service forwards the INVITE to the endpoint.</t>

          <t>The terminating endpoint chooses a compatible identity-challenge
          technique from the INVITE (TLS, DTLS, ICE, or HIP), and performs
          that challenge. Described in this document are identity challenges
          for TLS, DTLS, ICE, and HIP.</t>

          <t>All of the identity challenges (TLS, DTLS, ICE, and HIP) cause
          the exchange of either a certificate or a public key in the media
          path. The terminating endpoint compares the certificate or public
          key with the fingerprint in the (signed) Identity-Media header
          (originally created in step 2). If they match, the terminating
          endpoint completes the identity challenge exchange. After
          completion, the originating endpoint has proven (to the terminating
          endpoint) that the originating endpoint knows the private key
          associated with the certificate (or public key) signed in step 2.
          The terminating endpoint has now validated the identity of the
          originating endpoint.</t>

          <t>The terminating endpoint can reliably and honestly indicate
          calling party information ("caller-id") and ring the phone.</t>

               title="Identity Media Signature">
        <t>In RFC4474, a signature is formed over some SIP headers and over
        the entire body (which most typically contains SDP). In this
        specification, some SIP headers are signed but only specific SDP
        attributes that provide cryptographic identity are signed (e.g.,
        "a=fingerprint" and its value). The specific SDP attributes that are
        signed depends on which cryptographic identity technique(s) is used;
        see section <xref target="techniques"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The SIP headers that are signed, for the signature placed into the
        Identity-Media-Signature header are:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The AoR of the UA sending the message, or addr-spec of the From

            <t>The addr-spec component of the To header field, which is the

            choice amongst a set of tokens. The RFC2234 rules for the BNF
            specify that tokens are case sensitive. However, when used to
            construct the canonical string defined here, the first letter of
            each week and month MUST be capitalized, and the remaining two
            letters must be lowercase. This matches the capitalization
            provided in the definition of each token. All requests that use

      <section title="Validation">
        <t>The validation service can be performed by the remote endpoint
        itself or by a device acting on behalf of the endpoint. The validation
        service first checks the signature in the Identity-Media-Signature
        field. If this is valid, the endpoint (or its validation service
        operating on its behalf) then initiates a DTLS, TLS, ICE, or HIP
        identity proof (<xref target="techniques"></xref>). This causes the
        originating endpoint to prove possession of its private key that
        corresponds to the certificate (or public key) that was signed by the
        remote domain's authentication service.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="techniques" title="Proof of Identity Techniques">
      <t>Four techniques are described below, TLS, DTLS, ICE, and HIP. Each
      provides a means to cryptographically prove the identity signed by the
      authentication service in SIP is the same as the identity on the media
      path.</t>

      <t>Each of these techniques work similarly -- a fingerprint of the
      certificate (or, with ICE, the public key itself) is included in the
      SDP. The authentication service creates a new Identity-Media header and
      places into that header those SDP attribute names associated with that
      technique. The authentication service then creates a signature over
      specific SIP headers (see <xref
      target="identity_media_signature"></xref>), and places that signature
      into the new Identity-Media-Signature header. The SIP request is then
      sent outside of the originating domain.</t>

      <t>The receiving domain validates the Identity-Media-Signature. If
      successful, the SIP request is forwarded to the end system. The end
      system initiates a TLS, DTLS, ICE, or HIP session and validates that the
      (signed) certificate fingerprint presented in the SIP signaling matches
      the certificate presented in the TLS, DTLS, ICE, or HIP exchange. If
      they match, and the TLS, DTLS, ICE, or HIP exchange completes
      successfully, the local endpoint has validated the identity of the
      remote endpoint.</t>

      <t>Note: Due to SIP forking, the calling party may receive many identity
      challenges, each incurring a public key operation to prove identity.
      Mechanisms to deal with this are for future study.</t>

      <section title="TLS ">
        <t>TLS uses the "fingerprint" attribute to provide a hash of the
        certificate in the SDP. The fingerprint attribute is defined by <xref
        target="RFC4572"></xref> for TLS.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="DTLS">
        <t>DTLS uses the same "fingerprint" attribute originally described for

              RTP after a successful validation of identity which is quite
              undesirable. The SDP for doing RTP after a DTLS exchange might
              be signaled in SDP by using "RTP/AVP" rather than "RTP/SAVP"

        mechanism to fragment such large messages. It is also bandwidth
        inefficient to send multiple ICE connectivity checks containing public
        keys, either as retransmissions or with multiple candidates. Thus, for

        <t>Although the mechanism described in this paper allows SBCs to be
        used with a cryptographic identity scheme, it does expose the identity
        of the user's certificate. If a unique certificate is installed on
        each user's device, the remote party will be able to discern which
        device is terminating the call. This problem is more pronounced when

    <section title="Operational Differences from RFC4474">
      <t>RFC4474 imposes one public key operation for the authentication
      service and one for validation. If <xref target="RFC4916">Connected

      necessary for the header signature validation; the expense of the DTLS,
      TLS, or ICE public key operation has already been incurred by both
      parties and is not repeated.</t>

      <t>RFC4474 includes the Contact URI in the signed headers. That is not
      required by this mechanism because it adds no security property, and
      will fail validation when crossing SBCs and B2BUA's. It is of dubious
      security value because Via/Record-Route can be inserted for response
      interception regardless, and some requests don't contain a Contact
      anyway (e.g., MESSAGE). It does not provide any replay/copy-paste
      protection either, for the same reasons.</t>

      <t>RFC4474 includes the CSeq in the signed headers. That is not required
      by this mechanism because it adds little security, and will fail
      validation when crossing SBCs and B2BUA's in some cases. It is of little
      security value because it provides no protection from cut-paste attack
      for different targets, and although it would prevent replay attack
      within the same session, since the media key-related SDP portions are
      signed anyway, replaying the request will not do anything useful.</t>

      <t>RFC4474 includes the Call-Id in the signed headers. That is not
      required by this mechanism because it adds little security, and will
      fail validation when crossing SBCs and B2BUA's in some cases. It is of
      little security value because it provides no protection from cut-paste
      attack for different targets, and although it would prevent replay
      attack for the same target, since the media key-related SDP portions are
      signed anyway, replaying the request will not do anything useful.</t>
