Abstract

   Teredo uses return routing to discover the closest Teredo relay
   corresponding to any given peer.  Discovery is achieved by sending an
   ICMPv6 Echo Request and waiting for the appropriate relay to forward

   the ICMPv6 Echo Reply back.  Unanswered ICMPv6 Echo Requests make
   Teredo clients assume that the peer is unreachable.  This document
   identifies two scenarios where a middlebox should detect the lack of

Internet-Draft       ICMPv6 Echo Replies for Teredo             May 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Teredo protocol [RFC4380] uses return routing to discover the
   Teredo relay corresponding to any given non-Teredo IPv6 peer.
   Specifically, a Teredo client sends an ICMPv6 Echo Request to the
   peer and waits for a Teredo relay to forward the corresponding ICMPv6
   Echo Reply back.  If this does not happen within a reasonable delay,
   the Teredo client assumes that the peer cannot be reached via Teredo.
   In the IPv6 Internet, this normally works fine, as all IPv6 nodes
   implement sending of ICMPv6 Echo Replies in response to ICMPv6 Echo
   Requests.  However, two scenarios have been identified where this
   Teredo procedure might fail:

   1) When a NAT-PT [RFC2766] or NAT64 [I-D.bagnulo-behave-nat64]
   protocol translator is on the path: the translator translates an IPv6
   ICMPv6 Echo Request originating from Teredo client into an IPv4
   ICMPv4 Echo Request and forwards it toward the IPv4 peer.  However,
   in the IPv4 realm, ICMPv4 does not always work reliably.  If the IPv4
   peer does not reply with an ICMPv4 Echo Reply for any reason (for
   example, ICMPv4 Echo Replies are disabled or filtered by an IPv4
   firewall), the Teredo client will not get any ICMPv6 Echo Reply
   response packet back, and thus it will determine that the peer is
   unreachable.  That implies that transport sessions, which otherwise
   could have succeeded, will not even be initiated.  Effectively IPv4
   nodes behind protocol translators that do not successfully respond
   with ICMPv4 Echo Replies cannot be reachable by Teredo clients.

   2) When an IPv6 firewall blocks ICMPv6 Echo Requests or Replies: If a
   Teredo client sends an ICMPv6 Echo Request to a non-Teredo IPv6
   destination, yet does not receive any ICMPv6 Echo Reply back, because
   IPv6 firewall discard either packet, the Teredo client will determine
   that the peer cannot be reached.  As a consequence, it will not even
   try to route packets toward the destination.

   In both cases, Teredo-based IPv6 flows fail.  That will either cause
   delays in transport-layer connection setup, if the host is able to
   fallback to other source addresses, or complete connection failure in
   other cases.

   This document proposes a solution where a middlebox detects the
   problem and helps Teredo client to proceed by generating ICMPv6 Echo
   Reply for it.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Behavioral requirements for middleboxes

   A middlebox implementing this specification shall track ICMPv6 Echo
   Requests originated from Teredo hosts.  The middlebox shall generate
   ICMPv6 Echo Replies when determined necessary.  While generating the
   reply, the middlebox allows Teredo clients to go forward with their
   connectivity establishment procedures.

   A middlebox can determine the ICMPv6 Echo Request is coming from a
   Teredo client from the packet's IPv6 source address prefix, 2001:
   0000::/32, as described in RFC4380 [RFC4380].

2.1.  Configuration options

   The following options related to ICMPv6 Echo Reply generation SHOULD
   be configurable on a middlebox:

   o  Enable/disable: ICMPv6 Echo Reply generation for Teredo clients.

   o  Enable/disable: Forced ICMPv6 Echo Reply generation for Teredo
      clients.  If enabled, the middlebox shall always immediately
      generate an ICMPv6 Echo Reply when it detects an ICMPv6 Echo
      Request originated from a Teredo client.  If disabled, the
      middlebox shall generate ICMPv6 Echo Reply when one has been
      determined missing.

2.2.  Protocol translators

   As the NAT-PT [RFC2766] or NAT64 [I-D.bagnulo-behave-nat64] protocol
   translator entity is always on the return data path, it can detect
   whether an ICMPv4 Echo Reply is coming from the IPv4 peer and, if
   not, is able to generate an ICMPv6 Echo Reply toward the Teredo
   client.  The translator must not assume that lack of an ICMPv4 Echo
   Reply implies unavailability of the IPv4 peer.

   A protocol translator SHALL record the state of any translated ICMPv6
   Echo Request, and if no ICMPv4 Echo Reply is received within [TBD
   time], or if a retransmitted ICMPv6 Echo Request is detected, an
   ICMPv6 Echo Reply MUST be generated.  The protocol translator SHALL
   remove the state after the ICMPv4 Echo Reply is received and
   translated, and the ICMPv6 Echo Reply is generated, or TBD seconds
   since the last ICMPv6 Echo Request reception without retransmission.

   A protocol translator SHALL by default have automatic ICMPv6 Echo
   Reply generation enabled.

   In case forced ICMPv6 Echo Reply generation is enabled, ICMPv6 Echo
   Requests shall continue to be translated into ICMPv4 Echo Requests.

   Also, any received ICMPv4 Echo Reply shall be translated into an
   ICMPv6 Echo Reply.  In that case, the Teredo client may receive
   duplicate ICMPv6 Echo Replies.

2.3.  IPv6 firewalls

   By default IPv6 firewall MUST NOT generate ICMPv6 Echo Replies,
   because the lack of ICMPv6 Echo Reply should continue to indicate
   that the peer is unreachable, and because IPv6 firewall might not be
   on the return data path of ICMPv6 Echo Replies.

   A firewall, which is configured to filter ICMPv6 Echo Requests,
   SHOULD be configured to generate ICMPv6 Echo Replies for requests
   originated by Teredo clients.  Ultimately, it is up to the network
   administrator who configures the ICMPv6 filtering in place, to decide
   whether to allow or block communication between Teredo clients and
   services protected by the firewall.

   Firewall SHOULD generate ICMPv6 Echo Reply even if the destination
   IPv6 address of ICMPv6 Echo Request is not in use.  This enables
   Teredo to proceed and does not reveal information pertaining to the
   existence and liveliness of hosts located behind the firewall.  It
   also saves the firewall from storing extra state.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   Scanning for active IPv6 hosts behind a firewall is made useless by
   firewall replying to all ICMPv6 Echo Requests sourced from Teredo
   addresses.

   ICMPv6 Echo Reply generation MUST be rate-limited.
