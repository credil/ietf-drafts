1. Introduction

   Telecommunication carriers and network operators expect to replace
   aged TDM Services (e.g. legacy VPN services) provided by legacy TDM
   equipment by new VPN services provided by MPLS-TP equipment.

   From a service level agreement (SLA) point of view, service quality
   and availability degradation are not acceptable, even after migration
   to MPLS-TP equipment.

   In addition, from an operational point of view, the same performance
   monitoring granularity provided by TDM networks is expected from
   MPLS-TP networks. For example, OAM maintenance points should remain
   in the same locations after TDM to MPLS-TP migration, as SLA revision
   is typically NOT feasible for telecommunication carriers and network
   operators.

   MPLS-TP LSP protection switching can be triggered by fault conditions
   and external manual commands. Fault conditions include Signal
   Failure (SF) and Signal Degrade (SD). The SD condition could be
   detected at an intermediate link based on lower layer indications or
   other sub-layer techniques.

   Since the protection switching is not necessarily managed by the
   transport entity that detects the SD condition, a link condition
   indication must be sent over affected LSPs.

   This document describes guidelines for SD detection by lower layers
   indication, and a mechanism for relaying the degraded LSP condition
   to the network element handling the LSP protection switching.

3. Signal Degrade and MPLS-TP protection switching

   Network survivability, as defined in [2], is the ability of a
   network to recover traffic delivery following failure or degradation
   of network resources. [5] defines an LSP protection mechanism and
   state machine that handles SF, SD and operator manual commands.

4. SD detection method

4.1. Guidelines for SD detection

   The common basis for the guidelines set forth in this section is that
   the SD condition SHOULD reflect only BER conditions in the LSP lower
   layers, without any influence from non-BER-related conditions such as
   network congestion, CPU overload, selective packet discard, etc.

   The following conditions SHOULD be met by the signal degrade
   condition detection mechanism:

   o  Method for determining signal degrade MUST not disrupt the
      services transmitted over the link (e.g. add delay or jitter to
      real-time traffic)

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade MUST be agnostic to the
      length of frames transmitted over the link

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade MUST be agnostic to the
      transmission rate of frames transmitted over the link

Internet-Draft        draft-rkhd-mpls-tp-sd-01              March 2011


   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade MUST be agnostic to the
      type of service carried by the frames transmitted over the link

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade MUST be agnostic to the
      traffic class of frames transmitted over the link

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade MUST be agnostic to drop-
      precedence marking of frames transmitted over the link

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade MUST be agnostic to link
      congestion level

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade SHOULD be able to detect
      low BER levels (e.g. 10E-8)

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade SHOULD have low
      misdetection probability

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade SHOULD have low false
      alarm probability

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade SHOULD be agnostic to
      number of LSPs or PWs forwarded over the link

   o  Signal degrade conditions MUST be monitored by the lowest server
      layer or sub-layer that is not terminated between monitoring
      points

   o  It is RECOMMENDED that the method for determining signal degrade
      does not require transmission of additional traffic

4.2. Examples for SD detection methods

   o  A Server MEP [4] related to SONET or SDH sub-layers can determine
      SD condition based on error indication from parity information in
      the path overhead.

   o  A Server MEP related to OTN sub-layer can determine SD condition
      based on error indications from Forward-Error-Correction
      functionality inherent in encapsulation.

   o  A Server MEP related to 10GE PCS sub-layer can determine SD
      condition based on rate of errored 66-bit block headers.

   o  A Server MEP related to 1GE PCS sub-layer can determine SD
      condition based on rate of 10-bit code violations dispersion
      errors.

   As specified in section 4.1, these examples assume that the layer
   carrying the information used for SD detection is not terminated by
   non-MPLS-TP-LSR entities (e.g. media converter).

5. Transmission of link degradation fault indication

   When SD condition is detected, a link degradation fault indication
   [3] SHOULD be transmitted over affected LSPs, in the downstream
   direction from the detection point. The link degradation indication
   will be transmitted immediately following the detection and
   periodically until the SD condition is removed. The messages will be
   terminated and handled by the downstream MEP.

   The encapsulation and mechanism defined in [3] is suitable for
   transmission of link degradation fault indication. It is RECOMMENDED
   that [3] will include this definition in future work.

6. Handling of link degradation fault indication

   LSR behavior upon receiving link degradation fault indication is out
   of the scope of this document.

   SD condition processing and prioritization for protection triggering
   is out of the scope of this document.

7. Security Considerations

   To be added in a future version of the document.
