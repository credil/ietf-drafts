   application areas for LLNs, including industrial monitoring, building
   automation (Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning also referred
   to as HVAC, lighting, access control, fire), connected home,
   healthcare, environmental monitoring, urban sensor networks, energy
   management, assets tracking, refrigeration.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a terminology for discussing routing
   requirements and solutions for networks referred to as Low power and
   Lossy Networks (LLN).

   Low power and Lossy networks (LLNs) are typically composed of many
   embedded devices with limited power, memory, and processing resources
   interconnected by a variety of links, such as IEEE 802.15.4, Low
   Power WiFi.  There is a wide scope of application areas for LLNs,
   including industrial monitoring, building automation (HVAC, lighting,
   access control, fire), connected home, healthcare, environmental
   monitoring, urban sensor networks, energy management, assets tracking
   and refrigeration.

   Since these applications are usually highly specific (Industrial
   Automation, Building Automation, ...), it is not uncommon to see a
   number of disparate terms to describe the same device or
   functionality.  Thus it was needed to specify common terms for all
   LLNs to avoid confusion and discrepancies.  Terminology specific to a
   particular application are out of the scope of this document.

   It is expected that all routing requirements documents defining
   requirements or specifying routing solutions for LLN will use the
   common terminology specified in this document.


2.  Terminology

   Actuator: a field device that controls a set of equipments.  An
   actuator can control and/or modulates the flow of a gas or liquid,
   control electricity distribution, perform a mechanical operation, ...

   AMI: Advanced Metering Infrastructure that makes use of Smart Grid
   technologies.  Encompasses smart-metering applications.

   Channel: Radio frequency sub-band used to transmit a modulated signal
   carrying packets.

   Channel Hopping: A procedure by which field devices synchronously
   change channels during operation.

   Commissioning Tool: Any physical or logical device temporarily added
   to the network for the expressed purpose of setting up the network
   and device operational parameters.  The commision tool can also be
   temporarily added for scheduled or unscheduled maintenance.

   Closed Loop Control: A process whereby a device controller controls

   an actuator based on information sensed by one or more field devices.

   Controller: A field device that can receive sensor input and
   automatically change the environment in the facility by manipulating
   digital or analog actuators.

   DA: Distribution Automation, part of Smart Grid.  Encompasses
   technologies for maintenance and management of electrical
   distribution systems.

   Downstream: Data direction traveling from outside of the LLN (e.g.
   traffic coming from a LAN, WAN or the Internet) via a LBR.

   Field Device: physical devices placed in the network's operating
   environment (plant, urban, home, ...).  Field devices include
   sensors, actuators as well as routers and Low power and lossy network
   Border Router (including LBR).  A field device is most of the time
   (but not always) a constrained device with limited CPU, memory
   footprint, storage capacity, bandwidth and sometimes power
   constrained (battery operated).  At the time of writing, for the sake
   of illustration, a typicaly sensor or actuator would have a few
   KBytes of RAM, a few dozens of KBytes of ROM/Flash memory, a 8/16/32
   bit microcontroller and communication capabilities ranging from a few
   Kbits/s to a few hundreds of KBits/s.  Altough it is expected to see
   comtinuous improvements of hardware and software technologies, such
   devices will likely continue to be seen as constrained devices
   compared to computers and routers used in the Internet.

   Flash memory: non-volatile memory that can be re-programmed.

   FMS: Facility Management System.  A global term applied across all
   the vertical designations within a building including, Heating,
   Ventilating, and Air Conditioning also referred to as HVAC, Fire,
   Security, Lighting and Elevator control.

   HART: "Highway Addressable Remote Transducer", a group of
   specifications for industrial process and control devices
   administered by the HART Foundation (see [HART]).  The latest version
   for the specifications is HART7 which includes the additions for
   WirelessHART.

   HVAC: Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning.  A term applied to
   the comfort level of an internal space.

   ISA: "International Society of Automation".  ISA is an ANSI
   accredited standards-making society.  ISA100 is an ISA committee
   whose charter includes defining a family of standards for industrial
   automation.  [ISA100.11a] is a working group within ISA100 that is

   working on a standard for monitoring and non-critical process control
   applications.

   LAN: Local Area Network.

   LBR: Low power and lossy network Border Router.  The LBR is a device
   that connects the low power and lossy network to another routing
   domain such as a Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN) or
   the Internet where a possibly different routing protocol is in
   operation.  The LBR acts as a routing device and may possibly host
   other functions such as data collector or aggregator.

   LLN: Low power and Lossy networks (LLNs) are typically composed of
   many embedded devices with limited power, memory, and processing
   resources interconnected by a variety of links, such as IEEE
   802.15.4, Low Power WiFi.  There is a wide scope of application areas
   for LLNs, including industrial monitoring, building automation (HVAC,
   lighting, access control, fire), connected home, healthcare,
   environmental monitoring, urban sensor networks, energy management,
   assets tracking and refrigeration..

   Open Loop Control: A process whereby a plant operator manually
   manipulates an actuator over the network where the decision is
   influenced by information sensed by field devices.

   RAM: Random Access Memory.  The RAM is a volatile memory.

   ROM: Read Only Memory.

   ROLL: Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks.

   Schedule: An agreed execution, wake-up, transmission, reception,
   etc., time-table between two or more field devices.

   Sensor: device that measures a physical quantity and converts it to a
   analog or digital signal that can be read by a program or a user.
   Sensed data can be of many types: electromagnetic (current, voltage,
   power, resistance) , mechanical (pressure, flow, liquid density,
   humidity, ...), chemical (oxygen, carbon monoxide, ...), acoustic
   (noise, ultrasound), ...

   Smart Grid: a broad class of applications to network and automate
   utility infrastructure.

   Timeslot: A fixed time interval that may be used for the transmission
   or reception of a packet between two field devices.  A timeslot used
   for communications is associated with a slotted-link

   Upstream: Data direction traveling from the LLN via the LBR to
   outside of the LLN (LAN, WAN, Internet).

   WAN: Wide Area Network.
