Abstract 

   This Internet-draft discusses the relative importance of path 
   selection in peer-to-peer (P2P) applications. Recent discussions have 
   highlighted the conflict between the use of P2P applications and the 
   costs borne by network infrastructure operators. We conclude that it

   would be premature for the IETF to strongly pursue standardization in 
   this area.

1. Introduction 

   The purpose of this document is to juxtapose P2P context, importance, 
   problems with solutions offered by standards. In particular, the goal 
   is to explore whether the current challenges created by peer-to-peer 
   applications can be effectively solved, or at least ameliorated, 
   through standardization efforts. 

2. Context & Importance 

   P2P is a huge consumer traffic source[1,2]. The dominant use is for 
   file-sharing; streaming video is significant in some parts of the 
   world. Clearly P2P file sharing is an important application for users 
   and infrastructure owners. It is also mostly criminal (blatant theft 
   or civil disobedience?).

   This is an unwieldy conversation because many topics are grouped 
   together, but specific problems and solutions typically apply to a 
   single topic: 

   o  BitTorrent 

   o  File Sharing 

   o  Video on Demand 

   o  Voice & Instant Messaging 

   o  Peer-to-Peer v. Client-Server 

2.1. Technical Strengths 

   Effectively eliminates costs associated with distributing large 
   digital files. Individuals with consumer DSL connections can be 
   global-scale publishers of multi-gigabyte files. 

   Deploys and changes at the rate of change of end-user habits. Low 
   friction for develoment and deployment. There are no encumbrances 
   from service or infrastructure providers to slow things down. 

   Scales automatically with available resources, because it does not 
   require manual intervention to utilize capacity increases. 

3. Problems with P2P Applications 

   Home users:  

     - interference with latency apps (Shalanuv's comments on buffers in 
   home routers) Tends to fill buffers along paths, so all latency-
   sensitive apps sharing the path will suffer. 

     - can exhaust bandwidth caps 

   ISPs: large bw usage, usage scales w/capacity, not bursty but steady, 
   large, and long-lasting 

     - problem due to the conjunction of these three. For example, FTP 
   is also steady, large, and long-lasting but no one uses it. 

     - technical problems or business model problems?

4. Proposed Solutions 

   Localization, Caching, hybrid server-peer architecturs, Traffic 
   Shaping 

   ALTO is particularly concerned with mechanisms used to select peers. 
   Mechanisms are nicely surveyed in ALTO abstract, where two major 
   approaches are summarized: end-to-end measurement and application-to-
   network layer cooperation. 

   These peer selection ideas are only useful in contexts where peers 
   are abundant and many options of equivalent quality exist. 

5. Problems Solved via Standardization 

   What Problems do Standards Solve? 

   Avoid the problems associated with a single solution provider, such 
   as monopoly pricing power and technical frailty, by encouraging 
   commodification of the object of standardization. Avoid the problems 
   associated with the reinvention and fragmentation of common 
   solutions: safety (reduce likelihood of errors and mistakes), 
   interoperability, and quality. 

   No shortage of feasible technical solutions, but effectiveness 
   determined by business models and end-user willingness. 

   Examples 

   - Fixed prices with bandwidth caps. 

   - Pay-per-bit 

   - Traffic categories, per-category pricing model 

   Current user vocabulary is phone, video, and data. Obvious and clear 
   to consumer customers of telephone and cable companies. 

   Is the Internet a utility, infrastructure, or a service platform? 

   Utility: Electricity 

   - Charged for kwH used, doesn't matter what they are used for 

   Infrastructure: Roads 

   - Does not produce profit directly, but enables profitable uses.

   Service platform: mobile phones 

   - Seperate voice, data, and SMS pricing models. 

6. Security Considerations 

   Security risks tend to increase with complexity.  Any proposal that 
   increases the complexity of infrastructure or interfaces invites the 
   risk of complicating security.  More specifically, if a service 
   provider publishes information that is meant to bowl improve user 
   performance and reduce service provider cost, there will always be 
   the opportunity for subversion, or perhaps the more insidious 
   suspicion that the service provider is paying greater attention to 
   its costs than to the performance provided.  An effective antidote 
   for this situation is independent verification. 

7. IANA Considerations 

8. Conclusions 

   In conclusion, because standardization seems ill-positioned to 
   address the most pressing problems with peer-to-peer systems, it is 
   likely premature for the IETF to pursue any strong activities in 
   standardization.
