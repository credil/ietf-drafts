   The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selected

   mailbox.  A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a
   client that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and
   SEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the
   next.  This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes
   with one command, limiting the round-trips and waiting for various
   searches to complete.  This also introduces mailbox field in ESEARCH
   responses, allowing a client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.

Note

   A revised version of this draft document will be submitted to the RFC
   editor as a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community.  Discussion
   and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to

Internet-Draft     IMAP4 Multimailbox SEARCH Extension      January 2009


1.  Conventions used in this document

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [Kwds].


2.  Extended SEARCH/UID SEARCH command

   Arguments:  OPTIONAL source options
               OPTIONAL result options
               OPTIONAL [CHARSET] specification
               searching criteria (one or more)

   Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: SEARCH or ESEARCH

   Result:   OK - search completed
             NO - search error: cannot search that [CHARSET]
                or criteria
             BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

   This section further updates definition of the SEARCH command
   described in section 2.6.1 of [IMAPABNF] (initially described in
   section 6.4.4 of [RFC3501].

   The SEARCH command is extended to allow for optional source and
   result options.  This document does not define any result options.

   Unless specified otherwise by a description of a result option,
   presence of a search source option REQUIREs that the server returns
   ESEARCH responses instead of the corresponding SEARCH responses.
   Because message numbers are not useful for mailboxes which are not
   selected, each ESEARCH response MUST return information about UIDs
   and not message numbers (whether the SEARCH or the UID SEARCH command
   was issued), in particular it MUST contain the UID indicator.

   Presence of a source option in absence of a result option implies the
   "ALL" result option (see [ESEARCH]).

   [[anchor3: SEARCH with source options is allowed in authenticated
   state (and not just "selected")!!!]]

   Source options describe which mailboxes must be searched for
   messages.  (Without the source options only the current mailbox is
   searched.)  Note that a SEARCH/UID SEARCH command with source options



Leiba & Melnikov          Expires July 27, 2009                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     IMAP4 Multimailbox SEARCH Extension      January 2009


   doesn't affect which mailbox is currently selected and doesn't
   require any mailbox to be selected.  For each mailbox satisfying the
   source options, a single ESEARCH response MUST be returned.  The
   ESEARCH response MUST contain the MAILBOX correlator in addition to
   the TAG correlator.  Correlators allow clients to issue several
   SEARCH/UID SEARCH commands at once (pipelined).  The server MAY
   perform those searches in parallel; or it MAY instead serialize them.

   The source options, if present, MUST contain one or more mailbox list
   pattern, any one of them can contain the IMAP mailbox wildcard
   characters.  The patterns can be optionally followed by other search
   source options.  Only one such option is defined by this document:
   "DEPTH".  The option "depth <n>" causes the SEARCH command to
   traverse the hierarchy "n" levels down (including the current level).
   Thus, mailbox pattern "xyz*" with "depth 2" and mailbox pattern
   "xyz/*" with "depth 1" will both match child mailboxes of "xyz", but
   will not match child mailboxes of those children (of course, the
   former will also match "xyzabc", while the latter will not).

   If the server supports the ACL [ACL] extension, then the logged in
   user is required to have the 'r' right for each mailbox she wants to
   search.  Mailboxes matching the source options for which the logged
   in user has no 'r' right MUST be ignored by a multimailbox search.

   [[anchor4: Borrow syntax from the recent
   draft-ietf-lemonade-imap-notify?]]

   [[anchor5: Interaction with CONTEXT (RFC 5267) needs to be defined.
   Also, UPDATE option draft-ietf-lemonade-imap-notify might have to be
   prohibited when both CONTEXT and this extension are used.]]


3.  Example

   C: tag1 SEARCH IN (("folder1" "folder2/*") (depth 1)) unseen
   C: tag2 SEARCH IN (("folder1" "folder2/*")) subject "chad"
   S: * ESEARCH (TAG "tag1" mailbox "folder1") UID ALL
   4001,4003,4005,4007,4009
   S: * ESEARCH (TAG "tag1" mailbox "folder1") UID ALL 195001:
   195004,169788
   S: * ESEARCH (TAG "tag1" mailbox "folder2/banana") UID ALL 3002,4004
   S: * ESEARCH (TAG "tag1" mailbox "folder2/peach") UID ALL 921691
   S: tag1 OK done
   S: * ESEARCH (TAG "tag2" mailbox "folder2/dubya") UID ALL
   50003,50006,50009,50012
   S: tag2 OK done

4.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in [ABNF].  Terms not defined here are taken
   from [RFC3501], [LISTEXT] or [IMAPABNF].

               [[anchor7: Updates definition in RFC 4466 (added
               "[search-source-opts]"):]]

   search =    "SEARCH" [search-source-opts]
               [search-return-opts] SP search-program


               [[anchor8: Defined in RFC 4466 (updated to reference
               search-criteria):]]

   search-program =  ["CHARSET" SP charset SP]
               search-criteria
               ;; CHARSET argument to SEARCH MUST be
               ;; registered with IANA.


   search-source-opts =  SP "IN" SP "(" mbox-or-pat [SP "(" scope-
               options ")"] ")"


   scope-option =  "DEPTH" SP number /
               scope-option-ext


   scope-options =  scope-option *(SP scope-option)
               ;; a given option may only appear once


   scope-option-name =  tagged-ext-label


   scope-option-ext =  scope-option-name [SP scope-option-value]


   scope-option-value=  tagged-ext-val
               ;; This non-terminal shows recommended syntax
               ;; for future extensions.

               [[anchor9: Also defined in FILTERS:]]

   search-criteria =  search-key *(SP search-key)

               [[anchor10: Redefining search-correlator from RFC 4466:]]

   search-correlator =  SP "(" single-correlator *(SP single-correlator)
               ")"


               [[anchor11: This is a new non-terminal:]]

   single-correlator =  "TAG" SP tag-string /
               "MAILBOX" SP astring


               [[anchor12: The following 2 are borrowed from LISTEXT:]]

   mbox-or-pat =  list-mailbox / patterns


   patterns =  "(" list-mailbox *(SP list-mailbox) ")"



5.  Security Considerations

   [[anchor13: TBD]]


6.  IANA Considerations

   IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a standards track or
   IESG approved experimental RFC.  The registry is currently located
   at:


      http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities


   This document defines the X-DRAFT-I03-MMBX [[anchor14: Note to RFC
   Editor: fix before publication]] IMAP capability.  IANA is requested
   to add it to the registry.


7.  Acknowledgements
