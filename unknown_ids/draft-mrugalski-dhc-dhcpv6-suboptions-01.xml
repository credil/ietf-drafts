    <abstract>
      <t>DHCPv6 clients may use Option Request Option (ORO) defined in 
      <xref target="RFC3315">RFC3315</xref> to
      specify, which options they would like to have configured by
      DHCPv6 servers. Clients may also be interested in specific
      options that do not appear in DHCPv6 message directly (top-level
      options), but rather as nested options or sub-options
      (i.e. options conveyed within other options). This document clarifies
       how to use already defined ORO to request specific options within
      scopes other than top-level. This document updates RFC3315.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>There are 2 ways DHCPv6 client can inform a server about its
      intent to have an option configured. The first (mandatory) way
      is to send Option Request Option (ORO), defined in <xref 
      target="RFC3315"/>. The second way (optional, can be used as an
      addition to the first method) is to send the actual requested
      option to provide hints to a server.</t>

      <t>Clients may also be interested in receiving specific
      sub-options (i.e. options that do not appear in DHCPv6 messages
      directly, but rather within other options). Unfortunately, there
      is no clear way for clients to request such
      sub-options. <xref target="RFC3315"/> does not
      provide any guidance regarding such problem. This document
      clarifies how clients should request sub-options.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This section defines terms used in this document.</t>
      <t>Option - Any DHCPv6 Option, defined according to format
      specified in <xref target="RFC3315"/>. Option may appear in
      DHCPv6 message directly or within other options.</t>
      <t>Top-Level Option - an option that appears in DHCPv6
      directly. Most existing options are top-level options.</t>
      <t>Sub-Option - An option that appears not as top-level
      option, but rather within other option. An example of such
      option is IAADDR that may only appear withing IA_NA or IA_TA
      options. Sub-options are sometimes referred to as nested
      options.</t>
      <t>Scope - Any place (message or option) that is allowed to
      convey DHCPv6 options. Examples of scope are top-level (options
      conveyed directly withing DHCPv6 message), IA_NA (options
      conveyed within specific instance of IA_NA option), or IA_PD
      (options conveyed within specific instance of IA_PD option).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Suboption Request Procedure">
      <t>Clients that want specific option provided by the server,
        SHOULD include ORO within requested scope. This ORO MUST
        include requested option type. For example, if client expects
        to have suboption FOO configured in IA_NA, it should transmit
        IA_NA option that contains ORO. This ORO should convey a
        FOO option code and possibly other options requested within
        that scope.</t>

	<t>Client MAY include several instances of ORO, 
        one for each scope. Client MUST NOT include more than one 
	ORO in each scope.</t>
	
	<t>Discussion: Aforementioned simple procedure is easy to
        implement, but it does not cover all cases. Therefore following
        extension may be taken into consideration.</t>
	
	<t>There are cases, when client does not transmit options for each
	scope it expects to receive. Therefore client may not be able to follow 
	procedure defined in previous section. In such case client SHOULD
        include ORO option in the inner-most scope that is closest to
        the location of desired option. For example,
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-pd-exclude"/> defines PD_EXCLUDE option that may
        be placed withing IAPREFIX option, that in turn may be placed
        within IA_PD option that finally is placed in a DHCPv6 message.
        Client would like to receive PD_EXCLUDE option, but it in
        certain cases may choose to not send IAPREFIX within IA_PD, just empty
        IA_PD (e.g. in SOLICIT message). In such cases, client should
        include ORO within IA_PD, even though requested PD_EXCLUDE option will not be
        coveyed directly within IA_PD, but rather indirectly - within
        IAPREFIX that will be included in IA_PD.</t>

	<t>Example: TODO (provide example of client requesting top-level and nested
	option, e.g. DNS_SERVER and PD_EXCLUDE).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Justification">
      <t>As DHCPv6 protocol continues to be used to configure increasingly complex features,
      number of nested options will increase. To avoid each new document repeating the same sub-option 
      request procedure, it seems reasonable to define such uniform procedure now. Even worse, such
      documents may propose different ways of requesting different options. This would
      considerably complicate server implementations.</t>

      <t>Another alternative possible approach would be to simply use ORO as it is already defined.
      Client could include single instance of ORO to
      express desire to receive specific suboptions. Several existing
      server implementations deal with all options in an uniform
      way. Using top-level ORO to request suboptions would cause
      server to misplace requested options (i.e. to place them as
      top-level option rather than suboption). Avoiding such
      pitfalls, would complicate server implementation significantly,
      as servers would have to be configured with extra information
      regarding each option (where does specific option is supposed
      to appear - top level or as suboption). For example, in case when client requested PD_EXCLUDE 
      and DNS_SERVERS options, server would have to handle each requested option differently
      and put one option inside an IAPREFIX option, while the other option directly in a message.</t>

      <t>Discussion: (The following section should probably be removed if this draft
      is published). Currently there are several existing drafts that could benefit from 
      this proposal:</t>

      <list style="numbers">
	<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-pd-exclude"/> defines PD_EXCLUDE option that is 
	conveyed within IAPREFIX (that in turn is conveyed in IA_PD). Currently
	this draft calls for requesting PD_EXCLUDE in top-level ORO.</t>
	<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-mif-dhcpv6-route-option"/> defines a way to convey basic
	information about routers and prefixes available via those routers. It defines 
	IA_RT option that conveys NEXT_HOP option that contains RT_PREFIX options.
	Each of those defined options may possibly convey additional, not yet defined
	routing related options,  e.g. MTU, flow label, QoS parameters or many others.</t> 
	<t>Bernie Volz mentioned on DHC mailing list that one of the vendors used vendor specific
	information option within existing options. That particular vendor put
	ORO option within their option space.</t>
	<t>There is existing DHCPv6 implementation (Dibbler) that currently requests extra sub-options
	using top-level ORO. That is done differently than described in previous bullet. As such, 
	interoperation is not possible at this time.</t>
	<t>New draft about 4rd <xref target="I-D.despres-intarea-4rd"/> defines
	DHCPv6 option. While current definition should probably be improved,
	this architecture requires configuring one or more mapping rules. Each mapping rule
	consists of several mandatory (Domain IPv6 Prefix, Domain 4rd Prefix, Length of CE IPv6 Prefix) 
	and one optional (Domain IPv6 suffix) parameters. As all those options are dedicated to 
	configuration of different aspects of the same feature (4rd), there's distinct
	possibility that it will be defined as several options nested within a
	single grouping option. Although this architecture is a new proposal, there may 
	be new extensions proposed, similar to extensions to DS-Lite architecture. This may
	result in potential new options related to 4rd.</t>

    <section anchor="client" title="DHCPv6 Client Behavior">
      <t>In addition to standard behavior defined in <xref target="RFC3315"/> client SHOULD 
      include ORO in each option that it would like to receive suboptions in. For example, 
      if client wants to receive suboption FOO in IA_NA option, it SHOULD transmit IA_NA option
      that contains a single ORO with FOO option code.</t>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="server" title="DHCPv6 Server Behavior">
      <t>Server processes the message received from client in a
      regular way, as explained in <xref target="RFC3315"/>. For each
      option that is allowed to have suboptions (i.e. for each scope), server 
      checks if there is ORO present. For each ORO present, server appends requested
      options if it is configured to do so.</t>
