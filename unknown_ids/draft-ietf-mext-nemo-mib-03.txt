Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB),
   the network mobility support (NEMO) MIB, for use with network
   management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, the
   NEMO MIB will be used to monitor and control a Mobile IPv6 node with
   NEMO functionality.

Internet-Draft      NEMO Management Information Base       November 2008


1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework


   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


2.  Overview


2.1.  The Mobile IPv6 Protocol and NEMO entities

   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC3775] specifies a protocol which allows nodes
   to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.
   Network Mobility Basic Support (NEMO) [RFC3963] is an extension to
   the Mobile IPv6 protocol which facilitates the movement of an entire
   network.  The goals of Network Mobility support and related
   terminology are discussed in [RFC4886] and [RFC4885], respectively.

   Typically mobile routers implement NEMO functionality for achieving
   network mobility.  However, a mobile router may also function as a
   mobile node.  In the context of this document, an entity that
   implements the NEMO protocol is a NEMO entity.

   This document defines a set of managed objects (MOs) that can be used
   to monitor and control NEMO entities.


2.2.  Implementation Guidance

   This document focuses on the management of a NEMO entity.  The
   MIPv6MIB [RFC4295] defines the managed objects for a mobile node.
   Implementations supporting both the mobile node and NEMO
   functionality SHOULD implement the managed objects defined for the
   NEMO entities and mobile nodes from both the MIPv6MIB and NEMOMIB.

Internet-Draft      NEMO Management Information Base       November 2008


2.3.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document is consistent with the
   definitions used in the Mobile IPv6 protocol specification [RFC3775]
   and the NEMO Basic Support specification [RFC3963].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.4.  MIB Design

   The NEMO MIB comprises of the following groups of definitions:

   - nemoCore: a generic group containing objects that are common to all
   the NEMO entities.

   - nemoHa: this group models the home agent service.  It is composed
   of objects specific to the services and associated advertisement
   parameters offered by the home agent on each of its links.  It also
   contains objects pertaining to the maintenance of the home agent list
   on each of the links on which the service is offered.

   - nemoMr: this group models the mobile router service.  It is
   composed of objects specific to the Dynamic Home Agent discovery
   function and related parameters.  It also contains objects that
   record the movement of the mobile router.

   - nemoNotifications: defines the set of notifications that will be
   used to asynchronously monitor the NEMO entities.

   The tables contained in the above groups are as follows:

   nemoBindingCacheTable : models the binding cache on the home agent
   and correspondent node.  It contains details of the Binding Update
   requests that have been received and accepted.

   nemoMrEgressIfTable : contains information on the configured egress
   interfaces.

   nemoMrBLTable : models the Binding Update List on the mobile router.
   It contains information about the registration requests sent by the
   mobile router and the corresponding results.

   nemoHaCounterTable : contains registration statistics for all mobile
   routers registered with the home agent.

Internet-Draft      NEMO Management Information Base       November 2008


   nemoHaMobileNetworkPrefixTable : contains the list of the mobile
   network prefixes that are maintained by the home agent.

2.6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should assign a base arc in the mib-2 (standards track) OID tree
   for the 'nemoMIB' MODULE-IDENTITY defined in the NEMO MIB.


2.7.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These
   are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
   nemoStatus: The value of this object is used to enable or disable the
   NEMO functionality on a NEMO entity.  Access to this MO may be abused
   to disrupt the communication that depends on NEMO.
   nemoMrPrefixRegMode: The value of this object is used to control the
   mode in which mobile network prefixes will be registered with the
   home agent.  Access to this object may be abused to disrupt the
   setting up of mobile network prefixes.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability: The address-related objects in this MIB
   may be considered to be particularly sensitive and/or private.  The
   mobile network prefix- related objects reveal the configuration of
   the mobile router.  This information may be considered to be private

   and sensitive and must be carefully handled.

   nemoHaMobileNetworkPrefixLength

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
