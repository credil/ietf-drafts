1. Introduction 
    
   This document analyzes various schemes to realize Multiprotocol Label 
   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Label Switched Path 
   (LSP) recovery in multi-domain networks based on the existing 
   framework for multi-domain LSPs. 
    
   The main focus for this document is on establishing end-to-end 
   diverse Traffic Engineering (TE) LSPs in multi-domain networks. It 
   presents various diverse LSP setup schemes based on existing 
   functional elements. 
    
1.1 Terminology 
    
   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology in 
   [RFC4726] that provides a framework for inter-domain Label Switched 
   Path (LSP) setup, and [RFC4427] that provides terminology for LSP 
   recovery. 
    
   The following are several key terminologies used within this  
   document. 
    
   - Domain: See [RFC4726]. A domain is considered to be any 
     collection of network elements within a common sphere of address 
     management or path computational responsibility. Note that nested 
     domains continue to be out of scope. Section 1.2 provides some more 
     details. 
    
   - Working LSP: See [RFC4427]. The working LSP transports normal user 
     traffic. Note that the term LSP and TE LSP will be used 
     interchangeably. 
    
   - Recovery LSP: See [RFC4427]. The recovery LSP transports normal 
     user traffic when the working LSP fails. The recovery LSP may 
     transport user traffic even when the working LSP is transporting 
     normal user traffic (e.g., 1+1 protection). In such a scenario, 
     the recovery LSP is sometimes referred to as a protecting LSP. 
    
   - Diversity: See [RFC4726]. Diversity means the relationship 
     of multiple LSPs, where those LSPs do not share some specific type 
     of resource (e.g., link, node, or shared risk link group (SRLG)). 
     Diverse LSPs may be used for various purposes, such as load- 
     balancing and recovery. In this document, the recovery aspect of 
     diversity, specifically the end-to-end diversity of two traffic 
     engineering (TE) LSPs, is the focus. Those two diverse LSPs are 
     referred to as the working LSP and recovery LSP hereafter. 
     Sometimes, diversity is referred to as disjointness. 
    
   - Confidentiality: See [RFC4216]. The term confidentiality applies

draft-ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-recovery-analysis-03.txt      March 2008 
 
 
     to the protection of information about the topology and resources 
     present within one domain from visibility by people or 
     applications outside that domain. 
    
1.2 Domain 
    
   As defined in [RFC4726], a domain is considered to be any collection 
   of network elements within a common sphere of address management or 
   path computational responsibility. Examples of such domains include 
   IGP areas and Autonomous Systems. A network accessed over the 
   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User-to-Network 
   Interface (UNI) [RFC4208] and a Layer One Virtual Private Network 
   (L1VPN) [RFC4847] are special cases of multi-domain networks. 
    
   Example objectives of domain usage include administrative separation, 
   scalability, and forming protection domains. 
    
   As described in [RFC4726], there could be TE parameters (such as 
   color and priority) whose meanings are specific to each domain. In 
   such scenarios, mapping functions could be performed based on policy 
   agreements between domain administrators. 
    
1.3 Document Scope 
    
   This document analyzes various schemes to realize Multiprotocol Label 
   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) LSP recovery in multi-
   domain networks based on the existing framework for multi-domain LSP 
   setup [RFC4726]. Note that this document does not intend to prevent 
   development of additional techniques where appropriate (i.e., 
   additional to ones described in this document, which are based on the 
   existing framework described in [RFC4726]). In other words, this 
   document is informational and intends to show how the existing 
   framework can be applied with specific procedures described in this 
   document and the documents referred to by this document. 
    
   There are various recovery techniques for LSPs. For TE LSPs, major 
   techniques are end-to-end recovery [RFC4872], local protection such 
   as Fast Reroute (FRR) [RFC4090] (in packet switching environments), 
   and segment recovery [RFC4873] (in GMPLS). 
    
   In this document the main focus is the analysis of diverse TE LSP 
   (hereafter LSP) setup schemes (path computation and signaling 
   aspects), which can advantageously be used in the context of end-to-
   end recovery. This document presents various diverse LSP setup 
   schemes by combining various functional elements. In particular, 
   Section 5.5 of [RFC4726] describes some analysis of diverse LSPs in 
   multi-domain networks, and this document provides more detailed 
   analysis based on that content. 
    
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.        Expires September 2008                [Page 4] 
draft-ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-recovery-analysis-03.txt      March 2008 
 
 
   [RFC4105] and [RFC4216] describe requirements for diverse LSPs. There 
   could be various types of diversity, and this document focuses on 
   node/link/SRLG diversity.  
    
   Based on the service grade, both the working LSP and the recovery LSP 
   may be established at the time of service establishment (e.g., 
   service requiring high resiliency). Alternatively, the recovery LSP 
   may be added later due to a change in the grade of the service. This 
   document covers both scenarios. Also, there may or may not be 
   confidentiality requirements among domains. This document covers both 
   scenarios. Section 3.2 describes more details on confidentiality. 
    
   Specific assumptions made in this problem space are described in 
   Section 2. 
    
   Note that the recovery LSP may be used for 1+1 protection, 1:1  
   protection, or shared mesh restoration. However, ways to compute 
   diverse paths, and the signaling of these TE LSPs are common across 
   all uses, and these topics are the main scope of this document. 
    
   Also, note that diverse LSPs may be used for various purposes, in 
   addition to recovery. An example is for load-balancing, so as to 
   limit the traffic disruption to a portion of the traffic flow in case 
   of a single network element failure. This document does not preclude 
   use of diverse LSP setup schemes for those purposes. 
    
   The following are beyond the scope of this document. 
    
   - Analysis of recovery techniques other than link/node/SRLG diverse 
     LSPs (see Section 1.4). 
   - Details of maintenance of diverse LSPs, such as re-optimization and 
     OAM. 
   - Comparative evaluation of various diverse LSP setup schemes 
     mentioned in this document. 
    
1.4 Note on Other Recovery Techniques 
    
   Fast Reroute and segment recovery in multi-domain networks are 
   described in Section 5.4 of [RFC4726], and a more detailed analysis 
   is provided in Section 5 of [RFC5151]. This document does not cover 
   any additional analysis for Fast ReRoute and segment recovery in 
   multi-domain networks. 
    
   Also, the recovery type of an LSP or service may change at a domain 
   boundary. That is, the recovery type could remain the same within one 
   domain, but might be different in the next domain. This may be due to 
   the capabilities of each domain, administrative policies, or to 
   topology limitations. An example is where protection at the domain 
   boundary is provided by link protection on the inter-domain link(s), 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.        Expires September 2008                [Page 5] 
draft-ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-recovery-analysis-03.txt      March 2008 
 
 
   but where protection within each domain is achieved through segment 
   recovery. This mixture of protection techniques is beyond the scope 
   of this document. 
    
   Domain diversity (that is, the selection of paths that have only the 
   ingress and egress domains in common) may be considered as one form 
   of diversity in multi-domain networks, but this is beyond the scope 
   of this document (see Section 2.2). 
    
1.5 Signaling Options 
    
   There are three signaling options for establishing inter-domain TE 
   LSPs: nesting, contiguous LSPs, and stitching [RFC4726]. The 
   description in this document of diverse LSP setup is agnostic in 
   relation to the signaling option used, unless otherwise specified. 
    
   Note that signaling option-specific considerations for Fast Reroute 
   and segment recovery are described in Section 5 of [RFC5151]. 
    
2. Diversity in Multi-domain Networks 
    
   As described in Section 1.3, analysis of diverse LSP setup schemes in 
   multi-domain networks is the main focus of this document. This 
   section describes some assumptions in this problem space made in this 
   document. 
    
2.1 Multi-domain Network Topology 
    
   Figures 1 and 2 show example multi-domain network topologies. In 
   Figure 1, domains are connected in a linear topology. There are 
   multiple paths between nodes A and L, but all of them cross domain#1-
   domain#2-domain#3 in that order.

                     Figure 2: Mesh Connectivity 
    
   In Figure 2, domains are connected in a mesh topology. There are 
   multiple paths between nodes A and D, and these paths do not 
   necessarily follow the same set of domains. 
    
   Indeed, if inter-domain connectivity forms a mesh, domain level 
   routing is required (even for the unprotected case). This is tightly 
   coupled with the next hop domain resolution/discovery mechanisms. 
    
   In this document, we assume that domain level routing is given via 
   configuration, policy, or some external mechanism, and that this is 
   not part of the path computation process described later in this 
   document. 
    
   In addition, domain level routing may perform "domain re-entry", 
   where a path enters a domain after the path exits that domain (e.g., 
   domain#X-domain#Y-domain#X). This requires specific considerations 
   when confidentiality is required (described in Section 3.2), and is 
   beyond the scope of this document. 
    
   Furthermore, the working LSP and the recovery LSP may or may not be 
   routed along the same set of domains in the same order. In this 
   document, we assume that the working LSP and recovery LSP follow the 
   same set of domains in the same order (via configuration, policy or 
   some external mechanism). That is, we assume that the domain mesh 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.        Expires September 2008                [Page 7] 
draft-ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-recovery-analysis-03.txt      March 2008 
 
 
   topology is reduced to a linear domain topology for each pair of 
   working and recovery LSPs. 
    
   In summary, 
    
   - There is no assumption about the multi-domain network topology. For 
     example, there could be more than two domain boundary nodes or 
     inter-domain links (links connecting a pair of domain boundary 
     nodes belonging to different domains). 
   - However, there is an assumption that under such a network topology, 
     the set of domains that the working LSP and the recovery LSP follow 
     must be the same and pre-configured. 
   - Domain re-entry is not considered. 
    
2.2 Note on Domain Diversity 
    
   As described in Section 1.4, domain diversity means the selection of 
   paths that have only the ingress and egress domains in common. This 
   may provide enhanced resilience against failures, and is a way to 
   ensure path diversity for most of the path of the LSP. 
    
   In Section 2.1 we assumed that the working LSP and the recovery LSP 
   follow the same set of domains in the same order. Under this 
   assumption, domain diversity cannot be achieved. However, by relaxing 
   this assumption, domain diversity could be achieved, e.g., by either 
   of the following schemes. 
    
   - Consider domain diversity as a special case of SRLG diversity 
     (i.e., assign an SRLG ID to each domain). 
   - Configure domain level routing to provide domain diverse paths 
     (e.g., by means of AS_PATH in BGP). 
    
   Details are beyond the scope of this document. 
    
3. Factors to Consider 
    
3.1 Scalability versus Optimality 
    
   As described in [RFC4726], scalability and optimality are two 
   conflicting objectives. Note that the meaning of optimality differs 
   depending on each network operation. Some examples of optimality in 
   the context of diverse LSPs are: 
    
   - Minimizing the sum of their cost while maintaining diversity. 
   - Restricting the difference of their cost (so as to minimize delay 
     difference after switch-over) while maintaining diversity. 
    
   By restricting TE information distribution to only within each domain 
   (and not across domain boundaries) as required by RFC4105 and  
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.        Expires September 2008                [Page 8] 
draft-ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-recovery-analysis-03.txt      March 2008 
 
 
   RFC4216, it may not be possible to compute an optimal path. As such, 
   it may not be possible to compute diverse paths, even if they exist. 
   However, if we assume domain level routing is given (as discussed in 
   Section 2), it is possible to compute diverse paths using specific 
   computation schemes, if such paths exist. This is discussed in 
   Section 4. 
    
3.2 Key Concepts 
    
   Three key concepts to classify various diverse LSP computation and 
   setup schemes are presented below. 
    
   o With or without confidentiality 
    
     - Without confidentiality 
    
       Under this network configuration, it is possible to specify (by 
       means of the Explicit Route Object - ERO - comprising a list of 
       strict hops) or obtain record of (by means of the Record Route 
       Object - RRO) a route across other domains. 
    
       Examples of this configuration are multi-area networks, and some 
       forms of multi-AS networks (especially within the same provider). 
    
     - With confidentiality 
    
       Under this network configuration, it is not possible to specify 
       or obtain a full and strict route (by means of ERO/RRO) across 
       other domains, although paths may be specified/obtained in the 
       form of an ERO/RRO containing loose hops. Therefore, it is not 
       possible to specify or obtain a full route at the head-end of a 
       multi-domain LSP. 
    
       Examples of this configuration are some forms of multi-AS 
       networks (especially inter-provider networks), GMPLS-UNI 
       networks, and L1VPNs. 
    
   o Per domain path computation or inter-domain collaborative path 
     computation 
    
     - Per domain path computation 
    
       In this scheme, a path is computed domain by domain as LSP 
       signaling progresses through the network. This scheme requires 
       ERO expansion in each domain. The case for unprotected LSPs under 
       this scheme is covered in [RFC5152]. 
    
     - Inter-domain collaborative path computation

       In this scheme, path computation is typically done before 
       signaling. This scheme typically uses communication between 
       cooperating path computation elements (PCEs) [RFC4655]. An 
       example of such a scheme is Backward Recursive Path Computation 
       (BRPC) [brpc]. The use of BRPC for unprotected LSPs under this 
       scheme is covered in [brpc]. 
    
     Note that these are path computation techniques. It is also 
     possible to obtain a path via management configuration, or head-end 
     path computation (with multi-domain visibility). This is discussed 
     in Sections 4 and 5. 
    
     Note also that it is possible to combine multiple path computation 
     techniques (including using a different technique for the working 
     and recovery LSPs), but details are beyond the scope of this 
     document. 
    
   o Sequential path computation or simultaneous path computation 
    
     - Sequential path computation 
    
       The path of the working LSP is computed (without considering the 
       recovery LSP), and then the path of the recovery LSP is computed. 
       Typically, this scheme is applicable when the recovery LSP is 
       added later as change of the service grade. But this scheme can 
       also be applicable when both of the working and recovery LSPs are 
       established from the start. In this scheme, diverse LSPs may not 
       be correctly computed (without some form of re-optimization or 
       recomputation technique) in "trap" topologies. Furthermore, such 
       sequential path computation approaches may prevent the selection 
       of an "optimal" solution with regards to a specific objective 
       function. 
    
     - Simultaneous path computation 
    
       The path of the working LSP and the path of the recovery LSP are 
       computed simultaneously. Typically, this scheme is applicable 
       when both the working LSP and the recovery LSP are established 
       together. In this scheme, it is possible to avoid trap 
       topologies. Furthermore it may allow for achieving more optimal 
       results. 
    
   Note that LSP setup with or without confidentiality is given as a 
   per-domain configuration, while the choices of per-domain path 
   computation or inter-domain collaborative path computation, and 
   sequential path computation or simultaneous path computation may be a 
   matter of choice for each individual pair of working/recovery LSPs.

   The analysis of various diverse LSP setup schemes is described in 
   Sections 4 and 5, based on above criteria. 
    
   Some other considerations, such as network topology-specific 
   considerations, addressing considerations, and SRLG diversity are 
   described in Sections 6, 7, and 8. 
    
4. Diverse LSP Setup Schemes without Confidentiality 
    
   In the following, various schemes for diverse LSP setup are presented 
   based on different path computation techniques assuming that there is 
   no requirement for confidentiality between domains. Section 5 makes a 
   similar examination of schemes where inter-domain confidentiality is 
   required. 
    
4.1 Management Configuration 
    
   Section 3.1 of [RFC4726] describes this path computation technique. 
   The full explicit paths for the working and recovery LSPs are 
   specified by a management application at the head-end, and no further 
   computation or signaling considerations are needed. 
    
4.2 Head-end Path Computation (with multi-domain visibility) 
    
   Section 3.2.1 of [RFC4726] describes this path computation technique. 
   The full explicit paths for the working and recovery LSPs are 
   computed at the head-end either by the head-end itself or by a PCE. 
   In either case the computing entity has full TE visibility across 
   multiple domains and no further computation or signaling 
   considerations are needed. 
    
4.3 Per-domain Path Computation 
    
   Sections 3.2.2, 3.2.3 and 3.3 of [RFC4726] describe this path 
   computation technique. More detailed procedures are described in 
   [RFC5152]. 
    
   In this scheme, the explicit paths of the working and recovery LSPs 
   are specified as the complete strict path in the source domain 
   followed by one of the following: 
    
   - The complete list of boundary LSRs (or domain identifiers, e.g., AS 
     numbers) along the path. 
    
   - The boundary LSR for the source domain and the LSP destination. 
    
   Thus, ERO expansion is needed at domain boundaries. Path computation 
   is performed by, or by a PCE on behalf of, each domain boundary LSR.

draft-ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-recovery-analysis-03.txt      March 2008 
 
 
   For establishing diverse LSPs using per-domain computation, there are 
   two specific schemes, which are described in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 
   respectively. 
    
4.3.1 Sequential Path Computation 
    
   The RSVP-TE EXCLUDE_ROUTE Object (XRO) [RFC4874] can be used. Details 
   are as follows. It should be noted that the PRIMARY_PATH_ROUTE Object 
   defined in [RFC4872] for end-to-end protection is not intended as a 
   path exclusion mechanism. 
    
   Assume that the working LSP is established as described in [RFC5152]. 
   Also, assume that the route of the working LSP (full route) is 
   available at the head-end through the RRO. 
    
   o Path computation aspect 
    
     When performing path computation (ERO expansion) for the recovery 
     LSP as it crosses each domain boundary a path is selected that 
     avoids the nodes/links/SRLGs used by the working path so that a 
     diverse path is obtained. When path computation is performed by a 
     PCE on behalf of each domain boundary LSR, the resources to avoid 
     can be communicated to a PCE using the XRO extension [PCEP-XRO] to 
     the PCE Protocol (PCEP) [PCEP]. 
    
   o Signaling aspect 
    
     In order that the computation noted above can be performed, each 
     computation point must be aware of the path of the working LSP. 
     This information can be supplied in the XRO included in the Path 
     message for recovery LSP. The XRO lists nodes, links and SRLGs that 
     must be avoided by the LSP being signaled, and its contents are 
     copied from the RRO of the working LSP. 
    
   This scheme cannot guarantee to establish diverse LSPs (even if they 
   could exist) because the first LSP is established without 
   consideration of the need for a diverse recovery LSP. Crankback 
   [RFC4920] may be used in combination with this scheme in order to 
   improve the possibility of successful diverse LSP setup. Furthermore, 
   re-optimization of the working LSP and the recovery LSP may be used 
   to achieve fully diverse paths. 
    
   Note that even if a solution is found, the degree of optimality of 
   the solution (i.e., of the set of diverse TE LSPs) might not be 
   maximal. 
    
4.3.2 Simultaneous Path Computation 
    
   o Path computation aspect 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.        Expires September 2008               [Page 12] 
draft-ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-recovery-analysis-03.txt      March 2008 
 
 
    
     When signaling the working LSP, the path of not only the working 
     LSP, but also the recovery LSP is computed. For example, in 
     Figure 1, when node D receives a Path message for the working LSP 
     between nodes A and L, node D expands the ERO to reach domain#3. At 
     the same time, node D computes a path for the recovery LSP across 
     the same domain from node F to reach domain#3. The entry boundary 
     node for the recovery LSP (node F) needs to be known by the entry 
     boundary node for the working LSP (node D). In this example the 
     path for the working LSP may be computed by node D as D-E-domain#3, 
     and the path for recovery LSP as F-G-domain#3. 
    
   o Signaling aspect 
    
     Two signaling features are needed in order to make this scheme 
     work. 
    
     - A mechanism is needed to signal, during working LSP setup, the 
       entry boundary node to be used by the recovery LSP. This 
       mechanism may grow in complexity as the length of the chain of 
       domains grows, and as the interconnectivity of the domains 
       becomes more complex. But it may be perfectly feasible in simpler 
       topologies. 
    
     - There must be a mechanism to force the recovery LSP to follow the 
       route computed above. One way to realize this is to have a 
       specific object (with the same format as the ERO) to collect the 
       route of the recovery LSP in the Path message for the working LSP 
       and to return is to the head-end in the Resv message. When 
       signaling the recovery LSP, the content of the ERO is copied from 
       this object. 
    
     Protocol mechanisms to achieve these signaling features are not 
     currently available. The definition of protocol extensions is 
     beyond the scope of this document. 
    
   This scheme also cannot guarantee to establish diverse LSPs (even if 
   they could exist) if there are more than two domain boundary nodes 
   out of each domain. Crankback [RFC4920] may also be used in 
   combination with this scheme to improve the chances of success. 
    
   Note that even if a solution is found, the degree of optimality of 
   the solution (i.e., of the set of diverse TE LSPs) might not be 
   maximal. 
    
4.4 Inter-domain Collaborative Path Computation 
    
   Section 3.4 of [RFC4726] describes this approach, and [brpc] provides 
   detail of Backward Recursive Path Computation which is a 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.        Expires September 2008               [Page 13] 
draft-ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-recovery-analysis-03.txt      March 2008 
 
 
   collaborative path computation technique. Path computation is 
   performed for each of the working and recovery LSPs by the use of 
   inter-PCE communication before each LSP is signaled. 
    
   There are two specific schemes for establishing diverse LSPs using 
   this scheme, which are described in Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2. 
    
4.4.1 Sequential Path Computation 
    
   Route exclusion using the XRO [PCEP-XRO] can be requested in PCEP 
   [PCEP], and this can be used to compute the path of a recovery LSP 
   after the path of the working LSP has been determined. Details are as 
   follows. 
    
   The working LSP is computed using a collaborative PCE approach such 
   as that described in [brpc], and the LSP may be immediately 
   established. Assume that the path of the working LSP (full route) is 
   available from the computation request or from the RRO. 
    
   o Path computation aspect 
    
     When requesting path computation for the recovery LSP, an XRO is 
     included in the PCEP path computation request message (see 
     [PCEP-XRO]). The content of the XRO is copied from the RRO of the 
     working LSP. Alternatively, the content of the XRO is copied from 
     the ERO of the path computation reply for the working LSP. The 
     latter case is useful when the working LSP is not established at 
     the time of the path computation request for the recovery LSP. The 
     computation request specifies that the full route must be returned. 
     Per-domain PCEs may need to be invoked by the first PCE that is 
     consulted in order to collaboratively determine the correct path 
     for the recovery LSP (just as described in [RFC4655] and [RFC4726] 
     for the computation of a single inter-domain LSP by collaborating 
     PCEs), and these PCEs exchange the XRO information to ensure that 
     the computed path is diverse from the working LSP.  
    
   o Signaling aspect 
    
     The recovery LSP is signaled by including an ERO whose content is 
     copied from the result returned by the PCE. 
    
   This scheme cannot guarantee to establish diverse LSPs (even if they 
   exist) because the working LSP may block the recovery LSP. In such a 
   scenario, re-optimization of the working and recovery LSPs may be 
   used to achieve fully diverse paths. 
    
4.4.2 Simultaneous Path Computation 
    
   o Path computation aspect 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.        Expires September 2008               [Page 14] 
draft-ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-recovery-analysis-03.txt      March 2008 
 
 
    
     The PCEP SVEC Object [PCEP] allows diverse path computation to be 
     requested. It would be possible to extend BRPC [brpc] to compute 
     diverse paths through the definition of a specific process. Such 
     extensions are beyond the scope of this document. 
    
   o Signaling aspect 
    
     In this scheme the PCE returns the full routes for the working and 
     recovery LSPs and they are signaled accordingly. 
    
   This scheme can guarantee to establish diverse LSPs (if they exist), 
   assuming domain level routing is given as described in Section 2. 
    
   Furthermore, the computed set of TE LSPs can be guaranteed to be 
   optimal with respect to some objective functions. 
    
5. Diverse LSP Setup Schemes with Confidentiality 
    
   In the context of this section, the term confidentiality applies to 
   the protection of information about the topology and resources 
   present within one domain from visibility by people or applications 
   outside that domain. This includes, but is not limited to, recording 
   of LSP routes, in addition to advertisements of TE information. The 
   confidentiality does not apply to the protection of user traffic. 
    
   Diverse LSP setup schemes with confidentiality are similar to ones 
   without confidentiality. However, several additional mechanisms are 
   needed to preserve confidentiality. Examples of such mechanisms are: 
    
   - Path key: Provide each per-domain segment of the path in advance to 
     the domain boundary nodes or to the PCE that computed the path for 
     a limited period of time (temporary caching) and identify it in the 
     signaled ERO using a path key. When path computation is done by 
     PCE, the identify of the PCE containing state for the path may be 
     required as well (e.g., PCE I-D). The path key is provided by the 
     PCE to the head-end for inclusion in the ERO [conf-segment]. 
    
   - LSP segment: Pre-establish each per-domain segments of the path 
     using hierarchical LSPs [RFC4206] or LSP stitching segments 
     [RFC5150] and signal the end-to-end LSP to use these per-domain 
     LSPs. This scheme might need additional identifiers (such as LSP 
     IDs) in the Path message so that the domain boundary node can 
     identify which LSP segment or tunnel to use for the end-to-end LSP. 
     Furthermore, this scheme may require additional communication to 
     pre-establish the LSP segments. 
    


 
 
T.Takeda, et al.        Expires September 2008               [Page 15] 
draft-ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-recovery-analysis-03.txt      March 2008 
 
 
   These techniques may be directly applied, or may be applied with 
   extensions, depending on specific diverse LSP setup schemes described 
   below. 
    
   Note that in the schemes below, the paths of the working and recovery 
   LSPs are not impacted by the confidentiality requirements. 
    
5.1 Management Configuration 
    
   It is not possible to obtain or specify the full explicit route for 
   either LSP at the head-end due to confidentiality restrictions. 
   Therefore, this information cannot be provided to signaling for LSP 
   setup. 
    
   Confidentiality does not prevent the full computation of inter-domain 
   paths and signaling of sufficient information to distinguish the 
   paths. However the path information for each domain must be provided 
   in a way that does not have meaning to other domains. Example 
   mechanisms to preserve confidentiality as described above, include: 
    
   - Path key 
   - LSP segment 
    
5.2 Head-end Path Computation (with multi-domain visibility) 
    
   This scheme is not applicable since multi-domain visibility violates 
   confidentiality. 
    
5.3 Per-Domain Path Computation 
    
5.3.1 Sequential Path Computation 
    
   Assume the working LSP is established as described in [RFC5152]. 
    
   It is not possible to obtain the route of the working LSP from the 
   RRO at the head-end due to confidentiality restrictions. In order to 
   provide the path of the working LSP through each domain to the 
   computation point responsible for computing the path of the 
   protection LSP through each domain additional mechanisms are needed. 
   Examples of such mechanisms are: 
    
   - Information identifying the working LSP is included in the Path 
     message for the recovery LSP, and the domain boundary node consults 
     the entity which computed the path of the working LSP (i.e., domain 
     boundary node or PCE), so that the diverse path can be computed. 
     When the entity which computed the path of the working LSP is the 
     PCE, PCE needs to be temporarily stateful. An example of such 
     information is the Association Object [RFC4872]. 
    
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.        Expires September 2008               [Page 16] 
draft-ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-recovery-analysis-03.txt      March 2008 
 
 
5.3.2 Simultaneous Path Computation 
    
   In this scheme the intention is to compute the path of the recovery 
   LSP at the same time as the working LSP. In order to force the 
   recovery LSP to follow the computed path as well as to preserve 
   confidentiality, additional mechanisms are needed to communicate the 
   computed recovery path from the path of the working LSP (where it was 
   computed) to the recovery LSP. Examples of such mechanisms, that must 
   continue to preserve confidentiality, are as follows. 
    
   - LSP segment: As described before. The LSP segment for the recovery 
     LSP is established domain-by-domain as the working LSP setup 
     progresses. How to initiate such LSP segments for the recovery LSP 
     is beyond the scope of this document. 
    
   - Alternatively, information identifying the working LSP is included 
     in the Path message for the recovery LSP, and the domain boundary 
     node consults the entity which computed the path of the recovery 
     LSP (i.e., domain boundary node or PCE), so as to obtain the path 
     of the recovery LSP. This requires that the entity which computed 
     the path of the recovery LSP is temporarily stateful. An example of 
     such information is the Association Object [RFC4872]. Detailed 
     protocol specifications are beyond the scope of this document. 
    
5.4 Inter-domain Collaborative Path Computation 
    
5.4.1 Sequential Path Computation 
    
   Route exclusion using the XRO [PCEP-XRO] in combination with the path 
   key [conf-segment] can be requested in PCEP [PCEP] and this can be 
   used to compute the path of a recovery LSP after the path of the 
   working LSP has been determined. Details are as follows. 
    
   The working LSP is computed as described in [brpc] with the help of 
   path key [conf-segment], and may be immediately established. It is 
   not possible to obtain the RRO of the working LSP (full route) at the 
   head-end due to confidentiality restrictions. 
    
   o Path computation aspect 
    
     This is similar to the case without confidentiality (Section 
     4.4.1), but in order to preserve confidentiality, additional 
     mechanisms are needed. 
    
     In the PCEP path computation request for the recovery LSP, an XRO 
     is included. The content of the XRO is copied from the ERO of the 
     path computation reply for the working LSP, which is given in the 
     form of strict hops for the local domain, domain boundaries or 
     domain identifiers, and path keys. When a PCE receives XRO 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.        Expires September 2008               [Page 17] 
draft-ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-recovery-analysis-03.txt      March 2008 
 
 
     containing one or more path keys, it needs to retrieve the original 
     content and perform path computation for the recovery LSP excluding 
     certain nodes/links/SRLGs. It is likely that the content (i.e., 
     expansion) of the path key cannot be directly retrieved by a PCE in 
     one domain from a PCE in another domain since that act would 
     violate the intended confidentiality. Thus, path key expansion and 
     the computation of a path across a domain must both be performed 
     within that domain. 
    
   o Signaling aspect 
    
     The full route for the recovery LSP can not be returned to the 
     head-end by PCE because it cannot be collected from the other PCEs 
     owing to confidentiality restrictions. In order to force the 
     recovery LSP to follow the path computed above, additional 
     mechanisms are needed. Examples of such mechanisms are as described 
     before: 
    
     - Path key 
     - LSP segment 
    
5.4.2 Simultaneous Path Computation 
    
   As described in Section 4.4.2, diverse path computation can be 
   requested by PCEP SVEC Object [PCEP], and [brpc] can be extended for 
   inter-domain diverse path computation. However, it is not possible 
   for PCE to return the full route of the working LSP and recovery LSP 
   to the head-end due to confidentiality. In order to force the working 
   and recovery LSPs to follow the paths computed, additional mechanisms 
   are needed. Examples of such mechanisms are as described before: 
    
   - Path key: Use this for the working and recovery LSPs. 
    
   Note that the LSP segment approach in Section 5 may not be applicable 
   here because a path cannot be determined until BRPC procedures are 
   completed. 
    
6. Network Topology Specific Considerations 
    
   In some specific network topologies, diverse LSP setup schemes 
   mentioned above could be drastically simplified. 
    
   For example, assume there are only three domains connected linearly, 
   and the first and the last domain contain only a single node. Assume 
   that we need to establish diverse LSPs from the node in the first 
   domain to the node in the last domain. In such a scenario, no BRPC 
   procedures are needed, because there is no need for path computation 
   in the first and last domains.

draft-ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-recovery-analysis-03.txt      March 2008 
 
 
7. Addressing Considerations 
    
   All of the above-mentioned schemes are applicable when a single 
   address space is used across all domains. 
    
   However, there could be cases where private addresses are used within 
   some of the domains. This case is similar to the one with 
   confidentiality, since the ERO and RRO are meaningless even if they 
   are available. This document does not exclude other schemes, but 
   details are beyond the scope of this document. 
    
8. Note on SRLG Diversity 
    
   The above-mentioned schemes are applicable when the nodes and links 
   in different domains belong to different SRLGs. 
    
   However, there could be cases where the nodes and links in different 
   domains belong to the same SRLG. That is, where SRLGs span domain 
   boundaries. In such cases, in order to establish SRLG diverse LSPs, 
   several considerations are needed, such as: 
    
   - Record of the SRLGs used by the working LSP. 
   - Indication of a set of SRLGs to exclude in the computation of the 
     recovery LSP's path. 
    
   Furthermore, SRLG IDs may be assigned independently in each domain, 
   and might not have global meaning. In such a scenario, some mapping 
   functions are necessary, similar to the mapping of other TE 
   parameters mentioned in Section 1.2. 
    
9. IANA Considerations 
    
   This informational document makes no requests for IANA action. 
    
10. Security Considerations 
    
   This document does not require additional security considerations 
   mentioned in [RFC4726], which is the basis of this document. That is, 
   LSP path computation and setup across domain boundaries is 
   necessarily a security concern and will be subject to operational 
   policies. In particular, the trust model across domain boundaries for 
   computation and signaling must be carefully considered since LSP 
   setup (whether successful or not) can consume domain network data 
   resources (bandwidth), and signaling or computation requests can 
   consume network processing resources (CPU and control channel 
   bandwidth).

   RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and PCEP [PCEP] include policy and authentication 
   capabilities, and these should be seriously considered in all inter-
   domain deployments. 
    
   More discussion on security considerations in MPLG/GMPLS networks is 
   found in a specific document [security-fw].
