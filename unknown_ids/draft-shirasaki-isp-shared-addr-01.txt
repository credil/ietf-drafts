Internet-Draft             ISP Shared Address               October 2008


1.  Introduction

   IPv4 Global address is said to be run out soon.  Unless ISP takes any
   action, it will not be able to provide the service to new customers.

   To expand ISP's business, ISP has to continue assigning IPv4 address
   to its network.  Thus, under the condition of the IPv4 Global address
   exhaustion, ISP needs alternative address block.

   This document defines ISP Shared Address for this purpose.  It is
   used between Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) and Carrier Grade NAT
   [I-D.nishitani-cgn] (CGN) in a NAT444 network model
   [I-D.shirasaki-nat444-isp-shared-addr].

   ISP Shared Address is needed until the IPv4 Internet fades out.


2.  ISP Shared Address

2.1.  Definition

   ISP Shared Address is intended to be assigned between CPE and CGN in
   a NAT444.

2.2.  Details

   - Each ISP can use ISP Shared Address without any coordination with
   IANA or Internet registries.

   - ISP Shared Address can be used by many ISPs.

   - ISP has to install CGN to use ISP Shared Address.

   - ISP Shared Address must not be used at customers' site or Internet
   Exchanges.

   - Routing information of ISP Shared Address must not be advertised to
   the Internet.

   - Reverse DNS queries for this address space must not be sent to root
   DNS servers.

   - Packets with this space as source address and/or destination
   address must be filtered out at the border of each ISP.

   - It is known that almost every equipment such as routers, servers,
   and PCs reject packets from or to Class-E address
   [I-D.wilson-class-e].  Therefore, Class-E address is not applicable

Internet-Draft             ISP Shared Address               October 2008


   as ISP Shared Address.

   - Addresses within this address space should be unique within the
   ISP, or the set of ISPs which choose to cooperate over this space so
   they may directly communicate with each other in their networks.


3.  Size of Address Space

   The following table shows the coverage by the size of ISP Shared
   Address.  This table shows that four blocks of /8 are required to
   cover all ISPs on the Earth.  On the other hand, because, the minimum
   aggregation size of rural network is /12 in Japan (actually this
   happens around Tokyo area), we think /12 is the hard limit of minimum
   size ISP Shared Address.

   Therefore, we recommend to assign four /8 as the ISP Shared Address
   space but of cause we understand this can be determined by further
   discussions.

      +----------------------------+--------------+----------------+
      | Size of ISP Shared Address | ISP Coverage | Number of ISPs |
      +----------------------------+--------------+----------------+
      |             /10            |      44%     |       103      |
      |             /9             |      52%     |       58       |
      |             /8             |      65%     |       35       |
      |            /8 x2           |      82%     |       19       |
      |            /8 x3           |      92%     |        6       |
      |            /8 x4           |     100%     |        2       |
      +----------------------------+--------------+----------------+

    ISP coverage is the ratio that ISPs are covered by the size of ISP
   Shared Address as of October in 2008.  It is calculated with numbers
     of hosts in the IPv4 internet.  Table was generated by observing
                         actual BGP announcements.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is to record the allocation of the IPv4 global unicast address
   as ISP Shared Address in the IPv4 address registry.


6.  Security Considerations

   ISP Shared Address is supposed to be used with CGN.  The Global IPv4
   address that is assigned outside CGN may be used as source address of
   'Denial of Service' attack.
