Abstract

   The main goal of this document is to deprecate the use of HMAC-MD5 as
   an algorithm for the TSIG (secret key transaction authentication)
   resource record in the DNS (domain name system).


1.  Introduction

   The secret key transaction authentication for DNS (TSIG, [RFC2845])
   was defined with the HMAC-MD5 [RFC2104] cryptographic algorithm.  As
   the MD5 [RFC1321] security was recognized to be lower than expected,

Internet-Draft        Deprecating HMAC-MD5 in TSIG             June 2008


   [RFC4635] standardized new TSIG algorithms based on SHA
   [RFC3174][RFC3874][RFC4634] digests.

   But [RFC4635] did not deprecate the HMAC-MD5 algorithm.  This
   document is targeted to complete the process, in details:
   1.  Mark HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT as deprecated and replaced by HMAC-
       SHA256 in the TSIG algorithm name registry managed by the IANA
       under the IETF Review Policy [RFC5226]
   2.  Make HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT support "not Mandatory" for
       implementations
   3.  Provide a keying material derivation for the secret key
       establishment for DNS (TKEY, [RFC2930]) using a Diffie-Hellman
       exchange with SHA256 [RFC4634] in place of MD5 [RFC1321]
   4.  Finally recommend the use of HMAC-SHA256.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  TSIG Algorithm Name Registry

   In the registry of TSIG algorithm names, add this comment
   "(deprecated, see hmac-sha256)" in the HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT
   entry.

   This follows the style of the registry of DNSSEC algorithm numbers
   which was updated by [RFC3110].


3.  Implementation Requirements

   The table of section 3 of [RFC4635] is updated into:

             +-------------------+--------------------------+
             | Requirement Level | Algorithm Name           |
             +-------------------+--------------------------+
             | Deprecated        | HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT |
             | Optional          | gss-tsig                 |
             | Mandatory         | hmac-sha1                |
             | Optional          | hmac-sha224              |
             | Mandatory         | hmac-sha256              |
             | Optional          | hmac-sha384              |
             | Optional          | hmac-sha512              |
             +-------------------+--------------------------+

   Implementations that support TSIG MUST also implement HMAC-SHA1 and
   HMAC-SHA256 (i.e., algorithms at the "Mandatory" requirement level)

   and MAY implement GSS-TSIG and the other algorithms listed above
   (i.e., algorithms at a "not Mandatory" requirement level).


4.  TKEY keying material derivation

   When the TKEY [RFC2930] uses a Diffie-Hellman exchange, the keying
   material is derived from the shared secret and TKEY resource record
   data using MD5 [RFC1321] at the end of section 4.1 page 9.

   This is amended into:

         keying material =
              XOR ( DH value, SHA256 ( query data | DH value ) |
                              SHA256 ( server data | DH value ) )

   using the same conventions.


5.  IANA Consideration

   The section Section 2 should be applied according to the current IANA
   preferences, i.e., the update is in a [RFC3110] style and can be
   adapted to the style chosen by IANA for TSIG algorithm names.


6.  Security Considerations

   MD5 was proven to be less secure than expected in some uses, but
   HMAC-MD5 is not one of these uses, i.e., today HMAC-MD5 was not
   proved insecure [Bellovin].

   But for many reasons like to avoid insecure uses of MD5, or
   certification of cryptographic modules (e.g., [FIPS140-2], one cannot
   assume MD5 will be provided by all cryptographic modules, so even
   HMAC-MD5 does not lead today to security issues, it can lead to
   operational issues.

   The use of MD5 and HMAC-MD5 is NOT RECOMMENDED in TSIG and related
   specifications (i.e., TKEY).

   But SHA1 seems to be vulnerable too, so the use of at least SHA256 is
   RECOMMENDED.  Implementations which support TSIG are REQUIRED to
   implement HMAC-SHA256, the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm is RECOMMENDED for
   default use in TSIG.

7.  Acknowledgments

   Cryptographic module validation programs made MD5 not approved so not
   available.  They provide a good incentive to deprecate MD5 at a place
   it is still mandatory to support and likely heavily used.

   Olafur Gudmundsson kindly helped in the procedure to deprecate the
   MD5 use in TSIG, i.e., the procedure which led to this memo.  Alfred
   Hoenes and Peter Koch proposed some improvements.
