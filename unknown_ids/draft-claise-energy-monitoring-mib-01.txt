     1. Introduction 

        This document defines a subset of the Management Information 
        Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols for 
        monitoring the power state and the energy consumption of network 
        elements, taking into account the requirements specified in 
        [POWER-MON-REQ].  In addition to energy monitoring, 
        functionality to configure the power state of network elements 
        is proposed. 
         
        The MIB module in this document has been designed in order to be 
        as flexible as possible, with twelve different power levels, in 
        accordance to the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface 
        SPECIFICATION (ACPI) specifications [ACPI]. 
         
        The target devices include: routers, switches, attached devices 
        such as Power over Ethernet (PoE) devices, middle boxes, home 
        energy gateway, hosts and servers, sensor proxy, etc.  However, 
        the monitoring and configuration should be available for 
        individual components of devices as well, such as line cards, 
        processor cards, hard drives, etc. when those components are 
        independent from a power state point of view.  Those targets 
        devices and components may be characterized by the power related 
        attributes of a physical entity present in ENTITY-MIB, even 
        though the ENTITY-MIB compliance is not a requirement. 
      
         
     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
        current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
        section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to 
        the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 
        58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
         
      
     3. Terminology 

        EnergyMonitor Entity

     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>           Feb 2010 
         
           An EnergyMonitor Entity is a system of one or more 
           components, that provides power or draws power.  It can be 
           independently managed from a power monitoring and power state 
           configuration point of view.  This entity may be represented 
           by a physical component referenced using the EntPhysicalTable 
           from the Entity MIB RFC 2737.  
            
           Examples of EnergyMonitor Entities are a router line card, a 
           motherboard with a CPU, etc. 
            
         
        EnergyMonitor Level 
         
           A uniform way to classify power settings on an EnergyMonitor 
           Entity.  Levels are guidelines for the manufacturers of 
           entity (e.g., shut, hibernate, sleep, standby). 
            
         
        EnergyMonitor Scale 
         
           A scale used to represent smaller or larger quantities of 
           EnergyMonitor usage.  It conforms to the standard prefixes 
           for the SI (System International) units of measure.  Measured 
           values are represented in SI units obtained by BaseValue * 10 
           raised to the power of Scale. 
            
           For example, if current usage of an EnergyMonitor Entity is 
           3, it could be 3 W, 3 mW, 3 KW, 3 MW depending on the value 
           of EnergyMonitor Scale. 
            
            
        EnergyMonitor Domain 
         
          A EnergyMonitor Domain is a name or name space which 
          logically groups together EnergyMonitor Entities that 
          comprises a unit of manageable power consumption.  For 
          example, all phones in a floor, all EnergyMonitor Entities 
          from a specific building, or all EnergyMonitor Entities of a 
          specific device type for which a common profile is deployed.  
          From the point of monitoring power consumption, it is useful 
          to report the total energy consumed as the sum of energy 
          consumed by all the EnergyMonitor Entities of the 
          EnergyMonitor Domain.

     4. Concepts 

        EnergyMonitor Levels represent the one of twelve power 
        management states of an entity.  Each EnergyMonitor Level 
        corresponds to a global, system, and performance state in the 
        ACPI model. 
         
                  Level        ACPI Global/System      Name 
                                    State 
         
        Non-operational states: 
         
                    1               G3, S5           Mech Off 
                    2               G2, S5           Soft Off 
                    3               G1, S4           Hibernate 
                    4               G2, S3           Sleep, Save-to-RAM 
                    5               G2, S2           Standby 
                    6               G2, S1           Ready 
         
        Operational states: 
                    7               G0, S0, P5       Low 
                    8               G0, S0, P4       Frugal 
                    9               G0, S0, P3       Medium 
                   10               G0, S0, P2       Reduced 
                   11               G0, S0, P1       High 
                   12               G0, S0, P0       Full 
         
        For example, the energy state of the EnergyMonitor Entity is 9, 
        to indicate the entity is medium power consumption operational 
        state. 
         

       The emEnergyUsageCategory MIB object, specified as a read-only 
       object, specifies the energy usage type of the EnergyMonitor 
       Entity: energy consumer, energy producer, or meter.  The 
       emEnergyUsage, specified as Integer32, can have a positive or 
       negative value, corresponding with the usage type in 
       emEnergyUsageCategory, determining whether the EnergyMonitor 
       Entity consumes or produces power in case of "consumer" and 
       "producer". 

       An Energy Monitor Entity should have an emName, and a unique 
       EnergyMonitor index emIndex, and potentially an 
       entityPhysicalIndex from the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133], if supported 
       by the EnergyMonitor Entity.  The emName can be configured or 
       discovered by DNS.  Possible emName are: textual DNS name, MAC-

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires August 5, 2011            [Page 6] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>           Feb 2010 
       address of the device, interface ifName, or a text string 
       uniquely identifying the entity.  The emName should ideally be 
       unique.  As an example, in the case of phones, emName can be 
       discovered by DNS and can be the IP address or MAC-address.  In 
       the case of router/switch line cards, the emName shall be text 
       string.  That EnergyMonitor Entity can be a member of a 
       EnergyMonitor Domain.  The EnergyMonitor Domain could map 1-1 
       with a metered or sub-metered portion of the customers site.  It 
       can be used to further sub divide the deployment down to finer 
       EnergyMonitor Domains such as a lab, data center, rack, etc. 

        With the possible evolution of this draft, to a framework 
        document, the notion of EnergyMonitor Domain shall be useful.   
         
        For an EnergyMonitor Entity, instantaneous energy usage is 
        reported using emEnergyUsage and the unit magnitude of 
        measurement is specified in emEnergyUnits which is based on 
        EnergyMonitorPowerScale.  
         
        Nameplate power consumption of an EnergyMonitor Entity is 
        specified by the vendor as the maximum capacity required to 
        safely power the device.  Often this label is a conservative 
        number and is the worst case power draw of all elements in a 
        fully configured system.  While the actual utilization of an 
        entity can be lower, Nameplate power consumption is important 
        for power provisioning, capacity planning and billing.   
        In addition, to measurement of power consumption, an approach to 
        characterize the power demand is also presented in the MIB.  It 
        is well-known, in the electrical utility perspective, the demand 
        charges can weigh on par with actual energy charges.  So, in 
        addition to measuring power consumption, it is useful to 
        characterize the demand.  The demand can be described as average 
        power usage of an entity over a time window, called demand 
        interval, typically 15 minutes.  The highest peak demand 
        measured over a time horizon, say 1 month or 1 year is often the 
        basis for usage charge.  For example, a single window of time of 
        high usage can penalize the power consumption charges.  It is 
        relevant to measure the demand, only when there are actual power 
        measurements from an EnergyMonitor Entity.  There are cases, 
        wherein the power measurement of an EnergyMonitor Entity is 
        assumed, or predicted as pointed in the MIB OID 
        EnergyUsageCaliber.  
         
        Two tables are introduced to characterize the energy demand - 
        emDemandTable and emDemandControlTable.  emDemandControl Table 
        consists of parameters of the duration of the demand interval 
        specified in seconds, emDemandControlIntervalLength, (for e.g. 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires August 5, 2011            [Page 7] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>           Feb 2010 
        15 minutes); The number of demand intervals kept in the 
        emDemandTable, emDemandControlIntervalNumber, ; 
        emDemandControlSampleRate which is internal to the device to 
        calculate energy usage.  Judicious choice of SamplingRate would 
        help in accurate measurement of energy and ensure that it does 
        impose excessive polling burden.  The emDemandControlStatus is 
        useful to specify the power measurement is actual and thus to 
        indicate if the emDemandTable entries exist or not. 
      
        emDemand Table consists of measurements of energy 
        DemandIntervalEnergyUsed, the scale of energy measurement - 
        DemandIntervalEnergyScale and the maximum observed demand in a 
        window - emDemandIntervalMaxf 
         
        Various efficiency metrics can be derived and tracked with the 
        usage data present in this MIB module.  For example, 
         
        - Per-packet energy costs for a networking device (router or 
          switch) can be calculated by an network management system.  
          The packets count can be determined from the traffic usage in 
          the ifTable,  [RFC2863], from the forwarding plane figure, or 
          from the platform specifications 
        - Watt-hour energy use from this MIB can be combined with 
          utility energy sources to estimate carbon footprint and other 
          emission statistics.   
         
        An example is provided to illustrate the concepts.  For example, 
        a given EnergyMonitor Entity as described by the emIndex "7" 
        emPhysicalEntity "5" and emName  "switch2.foo.com".  For that 
        EnergyMonitor Entity, the energy measurement and power state is 
        reported as follows: the units of measurement emEnergyUnits is 
        "watts" (value 1), the instantaneous power usage enEnergyUsage 
        is 100 watts, while the maximum power consumption as prescribed 
        by the vendor emEnergyNamePlate is 300 watts.  The 
        emEnergyUsageCaliber indicates that the energy measurement is 
        "actual".  The power state of that EnergyMonitor Entity 
        EmEnergyLevel is "9" to indicate medium power usage and 
        emEnergyUsageCategory indicates the type of EnergyMonitor Entity  
        consumer or producer of power or both.  In addition, the maximum 
        power consumption at the level emLevelMaxUsage is indicated as 
        150 watts. 
         
        emDemandTable and emDemandControlTable are illustrated, 
        following the same example.  Firstly, in order to estimate 
        demand, an interval to sample power usage should be specified, 
        i.e.  emDemandControlIntervalLength can be "900 seconds" and the 
        number of consecutive intervals over which the maximum demand is 
        calculated emDemandControlIntervalNumber as "10".  The sampling 
        rate internal to the EnergyMonitor Entity for measurement of

     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>           Feb 2010 
        energy usage, emDemandControlSampleRate, can be "1000 
        milliseconds", as set by the EnergyMonitor Entity as a 
        reasonable value.  Then, the emDemandControlStatus is set to 
        active (value 1) to indicate that the EnergyMonitor Entity 
        should start monitor the usage as per the emDemandTable. 
         
        For the indexes in the emDemandTable are the emIndex, which 
        identifies the EnergyMonitor Entity and the 
        emDemandIntervalStartTime, which denotes the start time of the 
        demand measurement interval based on the sysUpTime. 
        emDemandIntervalEnergyUsed is the measurement of the energy 
        consumption over the time interval specified 
        (emDemandControlIntervalLength) based on the EnergyMonitor 
        Entity internal sampling rate (emDemandControlSampleRate).  The 
        units are derived from emDemandIntervalEnergyScale is based 
        EnergyMonitorScale.  For example, emDemandIntervalEnergyUsed can 
        be "100" with emDemandIntervalEnergyScale equal to 0, the demand 
        is 100 watt-hours.  emDemandIntervalMax is the maximum demand 
        observed can be "150 watt-hours".   
         
        The emDemandTable has a buffer to retain a certain number of 
        intervals, as defined by emDemandControlIntervalNumber.  If the 
        default value of "10" is kept, then the emDemandTable contains 
        10 demand measurements including the maximum.  A brief 
        explanation on how the maximum demand is calculated.  The first 
        observed demand measurement value is taken to be the maximum.  
        With each measurement, based on numerical comparison, maximum 
        demand may be updated.  The maximum value is retained as long as 
        the measurement is taking place.  Based on periodic polling, the 
        Network Management System can compute the maximum over a longer 
        period, i.e. a month, 3 months, or a year.  
         
        [POWER-MON-REQ] specifies some requirements about power states 
        such as "the current state - the time of the last change", "the 
        total time spent in each state", "the number of transitions to 
        each state", etc...  Such requirements are fulfilled thanks to 
        the emLevelChange NOTIFICATION-TYPE, indexed by the emIndex and 
        the emEnergyLevel, which is generated when the value of 
        emEnergyLevel has changed for the EnergyMonitor Entity 
        represented by the emIndex.  Indeed, assuming that the SNMP 
        notifications arrives to Network Management Station (NMS), the 
        NMS can deduce all the information. 
      
      
     5. Structure of the MIB 

        The primary MIB object in this MIB module is 
        EnergyMonitorMIBObjects.

        The emTable table defines the EnergyMonitor Entities, with a 
        potential link to the entPhysicalIndex, when available.  The 
        EnergyMonitor Entities are used for describing and configuring 
        the entities that are possible candidates for power management.  
        The specific EnergyMonitor Level can be configured in the 
        emTable.  
         
        The emLevelTable table lists the maximum power usage at each 
        EnergyMonitor Level for each EnergyMonitor Entity. 
         
        Finally, the monitoring of all the EnergyMonitor Entities on the 
        SNMP agent can be turned on/off with the emEnable MIB object. 
         
                     
     5.1. Link with the other IETF MIBs  

     5.1.1. Link with the ENTITY-MIB and the ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB  

        RFC 4133 [RFC4133] defines the Entity MIB module that lists the 
        physical entities of a networking device (router, switch) and 
        those physical entities listed indexed by entPhysicalIndex.  
        From an energy management point of view, of interest are the 
        physical entities that consume or produce energy.   
         
        RFC 3433 [RFC3433] defines the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB module that 
        provides a standardized way of obtaining information (current 
        value of the sensor, operational status of the sensor, and the 
        data units precision) from sensors embedded in networking 
        devices.  Sensors are associated with each index of 
        entPhysicalIndex of the Entity MIB [RFC4133].  While the focus 
        of the Energy Monitoring MIB, is on measurement of energy 
        consumption by networking equipment indexed by the entity MIB, 
        this MIB proposes a customized power scale for power measurement 
        and different power level states of networking equipment and a 
        functionality to configure the power level states. 
         
        When this MIB module is used to monitor the energy consumption 
        of devices such as routers and switches, the ENTITY-MIB and 
        ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB should be implemented.  In such cases, the 
        EnergyMonitor Entities are modeled by the entPhysicalIndex  
        through the emPhysicalEntity MIB object specified in the 
        emTable.   

        However, the ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB doesn't have the ANSI C12.x 
        accuracy classes required for electricity, i.e., 1%, 2%, 0.5% 
        accuracy classes.  These ANSI and IEC Standards require that we 
        use an accuracy class, and not the precision model in RFC3433.  
        The emEnergyUsageAccuracy MIB object models this accuracy. Note 
        that the emEntEnergyScale represents the scale is a more logical

        representation (compared to entPhySensorScale), with the 
        mantissa and the exponent values X * 10 ^ Y. 

        Finally, one cannot assume that the ENTITY-MIB and ENTITY-
        SENSOR-MIB are implemented for all EnergyMonitor Entity that 
        needs to be monitored.  A typical example is a converged 
        building gateway, monitoring several other devices in the 
        building, doing the proxy between SNMP and a protocol such as 
        BACNET.  Another example is the home energy controller.  
        In such cases, the emPhysicalEntity value contains the zero 
        value, thanks to PhysicalIndexOrZero textual convention. 
        As a consequence, the emEnergyMonitorId MIB object has been kept 
        as the unique Energy Monitor Entity index.  Finally, not that 
        the emEntEnergyUsage is similar to entPhySensorValue [RFC3433] 
        and the emEntEnergyScale is similar to entPhySensorScale 
         
        [EDITOR NOTE: the proxy table will be added in the next version 
        of the draft]. 
         
         
     5.1.2. Link with the ENTITY-STATE-MIB  

      
        RFC 4268 [RFC4268] defines the Entity State MIB module that 
        gives the operational states (enabled, disabled, testing) and 
        alarm states and usage states (idle, active, busy) of the 
        entities in the entity MIB.  From an energy monitoring point of 
        view, different power states to indicate the power state of the 
        entities models need to be developed.  The Energy Monitoring MIB 
        proposes the power states of entities in the Entity MIB. 
         
         
     5.1.3. Link with the POWER-OVER-ETHERNET MIB  

         
        Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC-3621] provides energy monitoring 
        and configuration framework for power over Ethernet devices.  
        The RFC uses a concept of group of ports of a switch to define 
        power monitoring and management policy and does not use the 
        entPhysicalIndex as index.  For the purpose on hand, power 
        monitoring of components of networking devices, RFC 3621 can not 
        be applied.

                "An enumerated integer value that represents the value 
                of EnergyMonitor Level, a power setting at which a 
                EnergyMonitor Entity uses power. 
                 
                The EnergyMonitor Levels are divided into six 
                operational states, and six non-operational states.  
                Each non-operational state corresponds to an ACPI 
                (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface 
                Specification, http://www.acpi.info/spec30b.htm) 
                Global and System level state between G3 (hard-off) and 
                G1 (sleeping).  The operational levels represent a 
                performance state, and correspond to ACPI states P0 
                (maximum performance & power) through P5 (minimum 
                performance and minimum power).   
                 
                EnergyMonitor Entities need not support all levels, but 
                a subset of the levels that can be mapped to their 
                system state. 
         
                 mechoff(1)  : An off state.  No entity features are 
                               available.  The entity is unavailable. 
                               No power is being consumed and the power 
                               Connector can be removed.  This maps to  
                               the level G3 in ACPI. 
         
                 softoff(2)  : Similar to off, but some components  
                               remain powered so the device can be woken  
                               from its off state.  In soft-off, no 
                               context is saved and the device requires 
                               a complete boot when awakened.  This maps

                 hibernate(3): No entity features are available.  The 
                               entity may be awoken without requiring a 
                               complete boot, but the time for  
                               availability is longer than sleep. 
                               This is generally the same as save-to- 
                               disk where DRAM context is not  
                               maintained. Minimal, nearly zero, or zero  
                               power is consumed.  This maps to level  
                               G1, S4 in ACPI.

                               be available.  The entity itself may be 
                               available but there may be a time delay 
                               for availability.  Processors are not 
                               executing, but their context is  
                               maintained. Low or less power is 
                               consumed.  This maps to level G1, S1 in  
                               ACPI. 
         
                 low(7)      : Indicates some features may not be

     7. Security Considerations 

        Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
        thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these 
        objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects 
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are the 
        tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         
        All other objects and tables contain no data that is considered 
        sensitive. 
         
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using 
        IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure 
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB modules. 
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) 
        them. 
         

     8. IANA Considerations 

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
         
               Descriptor            OBJECT IDENTIFIER value

        Additions to this MIB module are subject to Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested MIB objects for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description.  Requests for MIB objects that duplicate the 
        functionality of existing objects SHOULD be declined.  The 
        smallest available OID SHOULD be assigned to a new MIB objects.  
        The specification of new MIB objects SHOULD follow the structure 
        specified in Section 6 and MUST be published using a well-
        established and persistent publication medium.
