Abstract 

   This draft provides the Path Computation Element communication 
   Protocol (PCEP) extensions for the support of Routing and Wavelength 
   Assignment (RWA) in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON). 
   Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength 
   assignment (RWA) process.  From a path computation perspective, 
   wavelength assignment is the process of determining which wavelength 
   can be used on each hop of a path and forms an additional routing 
   constraint to optical light path computation.

1. Introduction 

   [RFC4655] defines the PCE based Architecture and explains how a Path 
   Computation Element (PCE) may compute Label Switched Paths (LSP) in 
   Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and 
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks at the request of Path Computation 
   Clients (PCCs).  A PCC is shown to be any network component that 
   makes such a request and may be for instance an Optical Switching 
   Element within a Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) network.  
   The PCE, itself, can be located anywhere within the network, and may 
   be within an optical switching element, a Network Management System 
   (NMS) or Operational Support System (OSS), or may be an independent 
   network server. 

   The PCE communications Protocol (PCEP) is the communication protocol 
   used between PCC and PCE, and may also be used between cooperating 
   PCEs.  [RFC4657] sets out the common protocol requirements for PCEP.  
   Additional application-specific requirements for PCEP are deferred 
   to separate documents. 

   This document provides the PCEP extension for the support of Routing 
   and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) in Wavelength Switched Optical 
   Networks (WSON) based on the requirements specified in [PCE-RWA].

Internet-Draft       PCEP Extension for WSON RWA              July 2011 
    

   WSON refers to WDM based optical networks in which switching is 
   performed selectively based on the wavelength of an optical signal. 
   In this document, it is assumed that wavelength converters require 
   electrical signal regeneration. Consequently, WSONs can be 
   transparent (A transparent optical network is made up of optical 
   devices that can switch but not convert from one wavelength to 
   another, all within the optical domain) or translucent (3R 
   regenerators are sparsely placed in the network).  

   A LSC Label Switched Path (LSP) may span one or several transparent 
   segments, which are delimited by 3R regenerators (typically with 
   electronic regenerator and optional wavelength conversion). Each 
   transparent segment or path in WSON is referred to as an optical 
   path. An optical path may span multiple fiber links and the path 
   should be assigned the same wavelength for each link. In such case, 
   the optical path is said to satisfy the wavelength-continuity 
   constraint. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between a LSC LSP 
   and transparent segments (optical paths).

   Note that two optical paths within a WSON LSP need not operate on 
   the same wavelength (due to the wavelength conversion capabilities). 
   Two optical paths that share a common fiber link cannot be assigned 
   the same wavelength.  To do otherwise would result in both signals 
   interfering with each other. Note that advanced additional 
   multiplexing techniques such as polarization based multiplexing are 
   not addressed in this document since the physical layer aspects are 
   not currently standardized. Therefore, assigning the proper 
   wavelength on a lightpath is an essential requirement in the optical 
   path computation process.

   When a switching node has the ability to perform wavelength 
   conversion, the wavelength-continuity constraint can be relaxed, and 
   a LSC Label Switched Path (LSP) may use different wavelengths on 
   different links along its route from origin to destination. It is, 
   however, to be noted that wavelength converters may be limited due 
   to their relatively high cost, while the number of WDM channels that 
   can be supported in a fiber is also limited. As a WSON can be 
   composed of network nodes that cannot perform wavelength conversion, 
   nodes with limited wavelength conversion, and nodes with full 
   wavelength conversion abilities, wavelength assignment is an 
   additional routing constraint to be considered in all lightpath 
   computation.  

   For example, within a translucent WSON, a LSC LSP may be established 
   between interfaces I1 and I2, spanning 2 transparent segments 
   (optical paths) where the wavelength continuity constraint applies 
   (i.e. the same unique wavelength MUST be assigned to the LSP at each 
   TE link of the segment). If the LSC LSP induced a Forwarding 
   Adjacency / TE link, the switching capabilities of the TE link would 
   be [X X] where X < LSC (PSC, TDM, ...). 

   [Ed note: in general, WSON LSC may not be the only switching layer 
   with switching constraints. From a GMPLS/PCEP perspective, 
   wavelength assignment corresponds to label allocation. This document 
   should align with GMPLS extensions for PCEP. Wavelength restrictions 
   and constraints should be formulated in terms of labels (i.e. 
   LABEL_SET, SUGGESTED_LABEL, UPSTREAM_LABEL, etc.) 

   In addition to those label switching constraints, each optical path 
   is constrained by the optical signal quality. The optical signal 
   quality depends first on the optical sender and receiver 
   capabilities. Second contributors to optical signal constraints are 
   the optical elements used on the path (optical fibers, amplifiers, 
   boosters, optical components). All those elements have an impact on 
   the optical signal quality that limits the ability of the optical 
   path to carry traffic. In order to improve the signal quality and 
   limit some optical effects several advanced modulation processing 
   are used. Those modulation properties contribute not only to optical 
   signal quality checks but also constrain the selection of sender and 
   receiver, as they should have matching signal processing 
   capabilities. 

   The optical modulation properties, also referred to as signal 
   compatibility, are already considered in signaling in [RWA-Encode] 
   and [WSON-OSPF].

   This document includes signal compatibility constraint as part of 
   RWA path computation. That is, the signal processing capabilities 
   (e.g., modulation and FEC) must be compatible between the sender and 
   the receiver of the optical path across all optical elements.  

   This document, however, does not address optical impairments as part 
   of RWA path computation. See [WSON-Imp] and [PSVP-Imp] for more 
   information on optical impairments and GMPLS.

2. WSON PCE Architectures and Requirements 

   Figure 2 shows one typical PCE based implementation, which is 
   referred to as Combined Process (R&WA). With this architecture, the 
   two processes of routing and wavelength assignment are accessed via 
   a single PCE. This architecture is the base architecture from which 
   the requirements have been specified in [PCE-RWA] and the PCEP 
   extensions that are going to be specified in this document based on 
   this architecture.

2.1. Encoding of a new RWA path request 

2.1.1. Wavelength Assignment (WA) Object 

   The current RP object is used to indicate routing related 
   information in a new path request per [RFC5440]. Since a new RWA 
   path request involves both routing and wavelength assignment, the 
   wavelength assignment related information in the request SHOULD be 
   coupled in the path request.  

   Wavelength allocation can be performed by the PCE by different 
   means: 

   (a) By means of Explicit Label Control, in the sense that one (or 
   two) allocated labels MAY appear after an interface route subobject. 
   (b) By means of a Label Set, containing one or more allocated Labels, 
   provided by the PCE.  

   Option (b) allows distributed label allocation (performed during 
   signaling) to complete wavelength assignment.  

   Additionally, given a range of potential labels to allocate, the 
   request SHOULD convey the heuristic / mechanism to the allocation, 
   including vendor-specific approaches. 

   The format of a PCReq message after incorporating the WA object is 
   as follows:  

   <PCReq Message> ::= <Common Header> 

                          [<svec-list>] 

                          <request-list> 

      Where:  

         <request-list>::=<request>[<request-list>] 

         <request>::= <RP> 

                      <ENDPOINTS> 

                      <WA>

   Note: if WA object is present in the request, the WA object MUST be 
   encoded after the ENDPOINTS object.                  

   The format of the Wavelength Assignment (WA) object body is as 
   follows:

      //                      Optional TLVs                          //

      Flags (32 bits) 

   The following new flags SHOULD be set 

   o  M (Mode - 1 bit): M bit is used to indicate the mode of 
      wavelength assignment. When M bit is set to 1, this indicates 
      that the label assigned by the PCE must be explicit. That is, the 
      selected way to convey the allocated wavelength is by means of 
      Explicit Label Control (ELC) [RFC4003] for each hop of a computed 
      LSP. Otherwise, the label assigned by the PCE needs not be 
      explicit (i.e., it can be suggested in the form of label set 
      objects in the corresponding response, to allow distributed WA. 
      In such case, the PCE MUST return a Label_Set object in the 
      response if the path is found.  

   (Ed note: When the distributed WA is applied, some specific 
   wavelength range and/or the maximum number of wavelengths to be 
   returned in the Label Set might be additionally indicated. The 
   optional TLV field will be used for conveying this additional 
   request. The details of this encoding will be provided in a later 
   revision.)   

   o  O (Order - 3 bits): O bit is used to indicate the wavelength 
      assignment constraint in regard to the order of wavelength 
      assignment to be returned by the PCE. This case is only applied 
      when M bit is set to "explicit." The following indicators should 
      be defined:

   2.1.2. Wavelength Restriction Constraint TLV 

   For any request that contains a wavelength assignment, the requester 
   (PCC) MUST be able to specify a restriction on the wavelengths to be 
   used. This restriction is to be interpreted by the PCE as a 
   constraint on the tuning ability of the origination laser 
   transmitter or on any other maintenance related constraints. Note 
   that if the LSP LSC spans different segments, the PCE MUST have 
   mechanisms to know the tunability restrictions of the involved 
   wavelength converters / regenerators, e.g. by means of the TED 
   either via IGP or NMS. Even if the PCE knows the tunability of the

2.1.3. Signal processing capability restrictions 

   Path computation for WSON include the check of signal processing 
   capabilities, those capability MAY be provided by the IGP, however 
   this is not a MUST.  Moreover, a PCC should be able to indicate 
   additional restrictions for those signal compatibility, either on 
   the endpoint or any given link.  

   The supported signal processing capabilities are the one described 
   in [RWA-Info]: 

     .  Modulation Type List 
     .  FEC Type List 
     .  Bit rate 
     .  Client signal 

   The Bit-rate restriction is already expressed in [PCEP-GMPLS] in the 
   GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object. 

   The client signal information can be expressed in the [PCEP-Layer] 
   REQ-ADAP-CAP object. 

   In order to support the Modulation and FEC information two new TLV 
   are introduced as endpoint-restriction in the END-POINTS type 
   Generalized endpoint: 

        .  Modulation restriction TLV 
        .  FEC restriction TLV. 

   The END-POINTS type generalized endpoint is extended as follow:  

   <endpoint-restrictions> ::= <VENDOR-ENDPOINT-RESTRICTION>| 

                  <signal-compatibility-restriction> | 

                  <LABEL-REQUEST><label-restriction> 

                  [<endpoint-restrictions>]

Internet-Draft       PCEP Extension for WSON RWA              July 2011 
    

   The MODULATION-FORMAT and FEC TLV are described in the following 
   sections. 

2.1.3.1. MODULATION-FORMAT TLV 

   This optional TLV represents a modulation format restriction. This 
   TLV MAY appear more than once in the endpoint-restriction.  

   The TLV type is TBD, recommended value 17. 

   The TLV data is defined as follow: 

    
    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   The format follows the definition from [WSON-Encode] section 4.2.1 
   with the exception that the modulation length is already represented 
   in the TLV Length field.  

   The S and I bit are set as described in [WSON-Encode] section 4.2.1. 

   The Modulation ID is as defined in [WSON-Encode] section 4.2.1. 

   The X bit is set to 1 to exclude the Modulation format, the X bit is 
   set to 0 to include the modulation format. 

   The reserved bits MUST be set to 0 on transmit and MUST be ignore on 
   receive. 

   The rest of the TLV is encoded following [WSON-Encode] section 
   4.2.1. 

    

2.1.3.2. FEC TLV 

   This optional TLV represents a FEC restriction. This TLV MAY appear 
   more than once in the endpoint-restriction.

   The TLV data is defined as follow: 

 
    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   The format follows the definition from [WSON-Encode] section 4.2.2 
   with the exception that the FEC length is already represented in the 
   TLV Length field.  

   The S and I bit are set as described in [WSON-Encode] section 4.2.2. 

   The FEC ID is as defined in [WSON-Encode] section 4.2.2. 

   The X bit is set to 1 to exclude the FEC; the X bit is set to 0 to 
   include the FEC. 

   The reserved bits MUST be set to 0 on transmit and MUST be ignore on 
   receive. 

   The rest of the TLV is encoded following [WSON-Encode] section 
   4.2.2. 

    

2.1.4. New XRO sub-object:signal processing exclusion 

   The endpoint restriction only applies to the END-POINTS object. 

   The PCC/PCE should be able to exclude particular types of signal 
   processing along the path in order to handle client restriction or 
   multi-domain path computation.  

   In order to support the exclusion a new XRO sub-object is defined: 
   the signal processing exclusion: 

       0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   The Attribute field indicates how the exclusion sub-object is to be 
   interpreted. The Attribute can only be 0 (Interface) or 1 (Node). 

   The sub-sub objects are encoded as in RSVP signaling definition 
   [WSON-Sign]. 

2.1.5. IRO sub-object: signal processing inclusion 

   Similar to the XRO sub-object the PCC/PCE should be able to include 
   particular types of signal processing along the path in order to 
   handle client restriction or multi-domain path computation.  

   This is supported by adding the sub-object "processing" defined for 
   ERO in [WSON-Sign] to the PCEP IRO object. 

    

2.2. Encoding of a RWA Path Reply 

   The ERO is used to encode the path of a TE LSP through the network. 
   The ERO is carried within a given path of a PCEP response, which is 
   in turn carried in a PCRep message to provide the computed TE LSP if 
   the path computation was successful. The preferred way to convey the 
   allocated wavelength is by means of Explicit Label Control (ELC) 
   [RFC4003].  

   In order to encode wavelength assignment, the Wavelength Assignment 
   (WA) Object needs to be employed to be able to specify wavelength 
   assignment. Since each segment of the computed optical path is 
   associated with wavelength assignment, the WA Object should be 
   aligned with the ERO object.   

   Encoding details will be provided further revisions and will be 
   aligned as much as possible with [WSON-Sign].

2.3. Error Indicator 

   To indicate errors associated with the RWA request, a new Error Type 
   (TDB) and subsequent error-values are defined as follows for 
   inclusion in the PCEP-ERROR Object: 

   A new Error-Type (TDB) and subsequent error-values are defined as 
   follows: 

   o  Error-Type=TBD; Error-value=1: if a PCE receives a RWA request 
      and the PCE is not capable of processing the request due to 
      insufficient memory, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with a 
      PCEP-ERROR Object (Error-Type=TDB) and an Error-value(Error-
      value=1).  The PCE stops processing the request.  The 
      corresponding RWA request MUST be cancelled at the PCC. 

   o  Error-Type=TBD; Error-value=2: if a PCE receives a RWA request 
      and the PCE is not capable of RWA computation, the PCE MUST send 
      a PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR Object (Error-Type=15) and an 
      Error-value (Error-value=2). The PCE stops processing the request.  
      The corresponding RWA computation MUST be cancelled at the PCC.  

    

 
2.4. NO-PATH Indicator 

 
   To communicate the reason(s) for not being able to find RWA for the 
   path request, the NO-PATH object can be used in the PCRep message.  
   The format of the NO-PATH object body is defined in [RFC5440].  The 
   object may contain a NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV to provide additional 
   information about why a path computation has failed. 

   Two new bit flags are defined to be carried in the Flags field in 
   the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV carried in the NO-PATH Object. 

   o  Bit TDB: When set, the PCE indicates no feasible route was found 
      that meets all the constraints associated with RWA. 

   o  Bit TDB: When set, the PCE indicates that no wavelength was 
      assigned to at least one hop of the route in the response.  

   o  Bit TDB: When set, the PCE indicate that no path was found 
      satisfying the signal compatibility constraints.

3. Manageability Considerations 

   Manageability of WSON Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) with 
   PCE must address the following considerations: 

3.1. Control of Function and Policy 

   In addition to the parameters already listed in Section 8.1 of 
   [PCEP], a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring the following 
   PCEP session parameters on a PCC: 

   o  The ability to send a WSON RWA request. 

   In addition to the parameters already listed in Section 8.1 of 
   [PCEP], a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring the following 
   PCEP session parameters on a PCE: 

   o  The support for WSON RWA. 

   o  A set of WSON RWA specific policies (authorized sender, request 
      rate limiter, etc). 

 
   These parameters may be configured as default parameters for any 
   PCEP session the PCEP speaker participates in, or may apply to a 
   specific session with a given PCEP peer or a specific group of 
   sessions with a specific group of PCEP peers. 

 
3.2. Information and Data Models, e.g. MIB module 

   Extensions to the PCEP MIB module defined in [PCEP-MIB] should be 
   defined, so as to cover the WSON RWA information introduced in this 
   document. A future revision of this document will list the 
   information that should be added to the MIB module. 

3.3. Liveness Detection and Monitoring 

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness 
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already 
   listed in section 8.3 of [RFC5440].

3.4. Verifying Correct Operation 

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new 
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in 
   section 8.4 of [RFC5440] 

 
3.5. Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components 

   The PCE Discovery mechanisms ([RFC5089] and [RFC5088]) may be used 
   to advertise WSON RWA path computation capabilities to PCCs. 

 
3.6. Impact on Network Operation 

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new network 
   operation requirements in addition to those already listed in 
   section 8.6 of [RFC5440]. 

    

4. Security Considerations 

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models 
   within PCEP [PCEP]. However the additional information distributed 
   in order to address the RWA problem represents a disclosure of 
   network capabilities that an operator may wish to keep private. 
   Consideration should be given to securing this information.   

    

5. IANA Considerations 

   A future revision of this document will present requests to IANA for 
   codepoint allocation.
