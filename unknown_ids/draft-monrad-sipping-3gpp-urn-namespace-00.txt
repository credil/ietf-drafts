Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) for Uniform
   Resource Namespace (URN) resources published by the 3rd Generation
   Partnership Project (3GPP). 3GPP defines and manages resources that
   utilize this URN name model.  Management activities for these and
   other resource types are provided by the 3GPP Support Team.

Internet-Draft           URN Namespace for 3GPP                June 2007


1.  Introduction

   3GPP is a cooperation of international telecommunication standards
   bodies developing technologies for cellular networks.  This activity
   is supported by a membership composed of network operators, equipment
   vendors, content providers, and other suppliers to the mobile market.

   Some of the technologies being developed by 3GPP need URN namespaces
   that are managed so that they are unique and persistent.  To assure
   that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a specific NID
   for use by 3GPP was deemed appropriate.  Therefore, a full and
   complete registration will follow the namespace specification process
   as defined in RFC 3406 [1].


2.  URN Specification for the 3GPP Namespace Identifier (NID)

   Namespace ID:

         The NID "3gpp" is requested.

   Registration Information:

         registration version number: 1
         registration date:           2007-06-21

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

                     06921 Sophia-Antipolis Cedex

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The URN consists of a hierarchical identifier, with a sequence of
      labels separated by periods.  The left-most label is the most
      significant one and is called 'top-level urn', while names to the
      right are called 'sub-urns'.  The set of allowable characters is
      the same as that for domain names RFC 1123 [2] and a subset of the

Internet-Draft           URN Namespace for 3GPP                June 2007


      labels allowed in RFC 3958 [3].  Labels are case-insensitive and
      MUST be specified in all lower-case.  For any given URN,
      identifiers can be removed right-to-left and the resulting URN is
      still valid, referring a more generic URN.  In other words, if a
      URN 'x.y.z' exists, the URNs 'x' and 'x.y' are also valid URNs.
      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the
      '3gpp-urn" NID will have the following structure:

        "URN:3gpp:"   3gpp-urn
        3gpp-urn      = top-level *("." sub-urn)
        let-dig       = ALPHA / DIGIT
        let-dig-hyp   = let-dig / '-'
        sub-urn       = let-dig [ *let-dig-hyp let-dig ]
        top-level     = let-dig [ *25let-dig-hyp let-dig ]

      3GPP maintains a naming authority, that will manage the assignment
      of '3gpp-urn' and the specific registration values assigned.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      3GPP provides information on registration for each URN.  More
      information about 3GPP and the registration activities and
      procedures to be followed are available at:

            http://www.3gpp.org

   OPEN ISSUE: The details on the web-address TBD.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      3GPP will manage resources using the "3gpp" NID and will be the
      authority for managing the '3gpp-urns' and subsequent associated
      subsequent string 'sub-urns'.  In the associated procedures, 3GPP
      will ensure the uniqueness of the strings themselves or shall
      permit secondary responsibility for management of well-defined
      sub-trees.

      3GPP may permit use of experimental type values that will not be
      registered.  As a consequence, multiple users may end up using the
      same value for separate uses.  As experimental usage is only
      intended for testing purposes, this should not be a real issue.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

Internet-Draft           URN Namespace for 3GPP                June 2007


      3GPP will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of
      the "3gpp" NID.  This will be structured such that each '3gpp-urn'
      as well as subsequent 'sub-urns', if needed, will have a separate
      description and registration table.

      The registration tables and information will be published and
      maintained by 3GPP on its web site.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      3GPP will provide procedures for registration of each type of
      resource that it maintains.  Each such resource may have three
      types of registration activities:

      1.  Registered values associated with 3GPP specifications or
          services
      2.  Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities
      3.  Name models for use in experimental purposes

   New Namespace Identifier (NID) labels

      Entries in the registration table will have the following format:

     3gpp-urn     Reference                Description
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     foo         3GPP specificationabc     Brief description of the 'foo' value
     foo.bar     3GPP specificationxyz     Description of the 'foo.bar' value

   Process for identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with a Resolution Discovery System
      (RDS); as this is not relevant.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
      RFC 2141 [4] apply.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
      supported and maintained by 3GPP.

   Scope:

      Global


3.  Examples

   The following examples are representative urns that could be assigned
   by 3GPP.  They are not actual strings that are assigned.

   urn:3gpp:featurephones

      Defines the '3gpp-urn' to be used for 'featurephones'.

   urn:3gpp:acme.foo-serv

      Defines the urn associated with the operator identified by the
      '3gpp-urn' value 'acme', which has decided to register and provide
      information about its service identified by the 'sub-urn' value
      'foo-serv'.


4.  Namespace Considerations

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project is developing a variety of
   enablers and applications.  Some of these require information to be
   fully specified.

   For proper operation, descriptions of the needed information must
   exist For the URNs and be available in a unique, reliable, and
   persistent manner.

   As 3GPP is ongoing and covers many technical areas, the possibility
   of binding to various other namespace repositories has been deemed
   impractical.  Each object or description, as defined in 3GPP, could
   possibly be related to multiple different other namespaces, so
   further conflicts of association could occur.  Thus the intent is to
   utilize the 3GPP specifications manager as the naming authority for
   3GPP-defined URNs and its descriptions.


5.  Community Considerations

   The objects and descriptions required for enablers produced by 3GPP
   are generally available for use by other organizations.  The 3rd

   Generation Partnership Project Support Office will provide access and
   support for name requests by these organizations.  This support can
   be enabled in a timely and responsive fashion as new objects and
   descriptions are produced.


6.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This section register a new URN NID with the registration provided in
   Section 2.

   The update can be found at:
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces and any associated
   mirrors.

   '3gpp-urns' and 'sub-urn' are identified by label managed by 3GPP.
   Thus, creating a new label does not require any IANA action.
