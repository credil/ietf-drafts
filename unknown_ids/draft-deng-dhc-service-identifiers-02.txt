Internet-Draft             Service Identifiers                 July 2008


1.  Introduction

   With the various kind of promising wireless broadband access
   technologies, there are more possbilities that mobile node could have
   multiple connections which may provide different kind of service
   available.

   In some cases, the operator would like to let the mobile node to know
   services are allowed or not allowed (not available) for the
   connection.  It may influence network routing, policy and quality of
   service, et al.

2.  Service Identifiers Supported Option

   Service which network supported means that it is OK to try that
   service over the connection.  The format of the Service Identifiers
   Supported Option is:


        0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |    length     |        Service Identifier                     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |    length     |        Service Identifier                     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |               |    length     |                   Service     |

       |  Identifier   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


              Figure 1: Service Identifiers Supported Option

   option-code: OPTION_SERVICE_SUPPORTED (TBD).

   option-length: length of the "service identifier list" field in
   octets.

   length

         length of the "service identifier" field in octets.  For
         example 'ims' will be 3, 'voip' will be 4, 'p2p' will be 3.
         Sometime it need indicate which port number will be supported,
         in such case ascii string will be used for it like the format
         of 'length''ascii-string' such as '5''34212'.

   Service Identifier

         A variable length UTF-8 encoded service identifier string used
         to identify the requested service. 'ims', 'voip' and 'p2p' are
         valid examples of Service Identifiers.  Some other protocol
         identifier has been specified by
         http://www.iana.org/protocols/.  When it need indicate the port
         number information, ascii string will be used for the format
         like '34212'.

3.  Service Identifiers Unsupported Option

   Service which network unsupported means that it will not be able to
   try that service over the connection.  The format of the Service
   Identifiers Unsupported Option is:


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |          option-code          |         option-length         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |    length     |        Service Identifier                     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |    length     |        Service Identifier                     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |               |    length     |                   Service     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |  Identifier   |

   option-length: length of the "service identifier list" field in
   octets.

   length

         length of the "service identifier" field in octets.  For
         example 'ims' will be 3, 'voip' will be 4, 'p2p' will be 3.
         Sometime it need indicate which port number will be
         unsupported, in such case ascii string will be used for it like

4.  Option usage

   There are various kinds of wireless broadband access technologies,
   one mobile node may have multiple wireless cards, thus a subscriber
   may choose different connections for different services.  The
   operators DHCPv6 server may provide a list of service identifiers
   option.  The mobile node will decide which service may be used with
   which connection based on this advertisement of the dhcp option.

   A mobile node that receives these options would need to remember
   which services are available / are not available on each interface.
   It may influence mobile node local routing policy or routing metrics.
   if one service could be supported by both wireless link, local
   routing policy will setup the priority for that service. if the
   server advetise the Service Identifiers Supported Option with a 0
   length list, it indicate that no service is allowed in this
   connection. if the server advetise the Service Identifiers
   Unsupported Option with a 0 length list, it indicate that all kinds
   of service will be allowed in this connection.  In the case of a
   mobile node has no connection with a particular service?  It may need
   subscribe different service or connect with the network operator.

5.  Security Considerations

   Basic security considerations in DHCP are described in section 23,
   "Security Considerations" of RFC3315.

   There is a possibility that a rogue DHCPv6 server could specify that
   all service is unsupported which would prevent access.  But rogue
   DHCPv6 server can do a lots of other things like assign a bad IP
   address or fake DNS servers, et.

6.  IANA Consideration

   This document defines two new DHCPv6 options, and IANA is requested
   to assign the following new DHCPv6 Option Codes in the registry
   maintained in http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters:

   OPTION_SERVICE_SUPPORTED

         for the Service Identifier Supported Option.

   OPTION_SERVICE_UNSUPPORTED

         for the Service Identifier Unsupported Option.

   New service identifier names are assigned through Standards Action,
   as defined in RFC 5225.

   'ims', 'voip', 'p2p'

         for the service identifier of the IMS, VoIP, and P2P Internet
         service.  And IANA is requested to establish a registry for the
         service identifier names.
