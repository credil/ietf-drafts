<abstract>
  <t>This document specifies a protocol mechanism tailored to advance
  deployment of IPv6 to end users via a Service Provider's IPv4
  network infrastructure. Key aspects include automatic IPv6 prefix
  delegation to sites, stateless operation, simple provisioning, and
  service which is equivalent to native IPv6 outside of the SP's IPv4
  network infrastructure.</t>
</abstract>

<middle>
 <section title="Introduction">
   <t>The original idea and the name of the mechanism (6rd) specified
   in this document is described in <xref
   target="I-D.despres-6rd">draft-despres-6rd</xref>, which details a
   successful commercial "rapid deployment" of the 6rd mechanism by a
   residential Service Provider and is recommended background
   reading.</t>

   <t> This document describes the 6rd mechanism, extended for use in
   more general environments, and intended for advancement on the
   IETF Standards Track. Throughout this document, the term 6rd is
   used to refer to the new mechanisms described here and 6to4 as
   that which is described in RFC 3056.</t>

   <t>6rd specifies a protocol mechanism to deploy IPv6 to sites via
   a Service Provider's (SP's) IPv4 network.  It builds on 6to4 <xref
   target="RFC3056"></xref>, with the key differentiator that it
   utilizes an SP's own IPv6 address prefix rather than 2002::/16. By
   using the SP's IPv6 prefix, the operational domain of 6rd is
   limited to the SP network and under its direct control. From the
   perspective of customer sites and the IPv6 Internet at large connected
   to the 6rd-enabled SP network, the IPv6 service provided is equivalent
   to native IPv6.</t>

   <t>6rd does not translate IPv4 into IPv6, it encapsulates IPv6 in IPv4 with
   a destination IPv4 address which is either encoded within the IPv6
   destination address itself, or is the destination address of a
   preconfigured 6rd Border Relay router that can decapsulate the IPv4 header
   and route the IPv6 packet outside the SP's IPv4 network. This way, IPv6
   packets follow the IPv4 routing topology within the SP network, and Border
   Relays are traversed only for IPv6 packets which are destined or are
   arriving outside the SP's IPv4 network. The 6rd mechanism is fully
   stateless, so the Border Relay routers may be addressed via anycast within
   the SP network for added resiliency. </t>

   <t>The 6rd Customer Edge router (6rd CE) plays a critical role in
   a 6rd deployment. 6rd decouples deployment of IPv6 on the "LAN"
   side of the 6rd CE router from that on the "WAN" side, allowing
   IPv6 on either side to be deployed and evolve independently. On
   the LAN (e.g., "Home") side of the 6rd CE router, 6rd expects that
   IPv6 is implemented as it would be for any native dual-stack IP
   service delivered by the SP. On the WAN side of the 6rd CE router,
   the 6rd CE WAN interface itself, the access network between it and
   partnering 6rd equipment, and the OSS system including DHCP, AAA,
   etc. may remain IPv4-only (e.g., there is no need to deploy <xref
   target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref>, IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, IPv6
   routing, create IPv6 address plans, etc. within the SP network to
   deliver IPv6 to the customer site). </t>

   <t>6rd relies on IPv4 and is designed to deliver
   "production-quality" dual-stack IPv6 and IPv4 Internet access to
   customer sites. IPv6 deployment within the SP network itself may
   continue for the SP's own purposes outside of delivering IPv6
   service to customers. Once IPv6 is fully available, 6rd may be
   discontinued and IPv4 eventually turned off or tunneled over IPv6
   as described in <xref
   target="I-D.durand-softwire-dual-stack-lite">draft-ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite</xref>. </t>

       <t hangText="6rd Delegated Prefix">The IPv6 prefix determined by the
       6rd CE device for use by hosts within the customer site. This prefix
       can be considered logically equivalent to a DHCPv6 IPv6 Delegated
       Prefix <xref target="RFC3633"></xref>, though it is calculated by
       combining the 6rd SP Prefix and the end user's IPv4 address obtained
       via IPv4 configuration methods.</t>
       <t hangText="6rd SP Prefix">
       An IPv6 prefix selected by the Service Provider for use by a given 6rd
       deployment. This may be the entire IPv6 prefix obtained from an RIR
       and announced to the IPv6 Internet, or a more-specific assigned just
       to given 6rd deployment.</t>
       <t hangText="6rd CE">The 6rd "Customer Edge" router that sits between
       an IPv6-enabled site and an IPv4-enable SP network.  In a residential
       broadband deployment this is sometimes referred to as the "Residential
       Gateway (RG)," "Customer Premises Equipment," (CPE) or "Internet
       Gateway Device" (IGD). This router has a one internal 6rd Virtual
       Interface acting as an endpoint for the IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation and
       forwarding, at least one "6rd CE LAN Side" interface and "6rd CE WAN
       Side" interface, respectively. </t>
       <t hangText="6rd CE LAN Side"> The functionality of a 6rd CE router
       that serves the "Local Area Network (LAN)" or "Home" side of a
       broadband service provider connection. The 6rd CE LAN Side interface
       is fully IPv6 enabled.</t>
       <t hangText="6rd CE WAN Side">
       The functionality of a 6rd CE Router that serves the "Wide Area
       Network" or "Service Provider" side of the 6rd CE Router. The
       6rd CE WAN side is IPv4-only, except that it delivers IPv6
       packets encapsulated in IPv4 by the 6rd Virtual Interface.
       </t>
       <t hangText="6rd BR">A 6rd-enabled "Border Relay" router located at
       the SP premises. The 6rd BR router has at least one IPv4 interface, an
       internal 6rd Virtual Interface for multi-point tunneling, and at least
       one IPv6 interface that is reachable via the IPv6 Internet or
       IPv6-enabled portion of the SP network.</t>
       <t hangText="6rd Virtual Interface"> Internal multi-point tunnel
       interface where 6rd encapsulation and decapsulation of IPv6 packets
       inside IPv4 occurs. A typical 6rd CE or 6rd BR implementation requires
       one 6rd Virtual Interface.</t>
       <t hangText="Subscriber IPv4 address">The IPv4 address given to the
       subscriber as part of normal IPv4 Internet access (i.e., configured via
       DHCP, PPP, or otherwise). This address may be global or private
       (RFC1918) within the 6rd domain. This address is used by 6rd to create
       the 6rd IPv6 prefix, and to send and receive IPv6 packets encapsulated
       in IPv4 by the 6rd mechanism.</t>
   </list></t>
 </section>


 <section anchor="prefix_alloc" title="6rd Prefix Delegation">
   <t>In 6rd, a customer site's IPv6 Delegated Prefix is derived from 2
   elements:</t>

   <t><list style="numbers">
       <t>An IPv6 Prefix selected by the SP to be the common 6rd SP Prefix
       for the given 6rd deployment (an SP can have multiple 6rd deployments
       called domains). </t>
       <t>An assigned IPv4 address for the subscriber. This IPv4 address may
       be a global IPv4 address, or a <xref target="RFC1918">Private RFC
       1918</xref> IPv4 address.</t>
   </list></t>

   <t>From these three items, the 6rd Delegated Prefix is automatically
   created for the customer site when IPv4 service is obtained. From the
   perspective of the 6rd CE LAN-Side functionality, this IPv6 delegated
   prefix is used in the same manner as a prefix obtained via DHCPv6 Prefix
   Delegation <xref target="RFC3633"></xref>.</t>

   <t>In 6to4, the location of the stored 32-bit IPv4 address is at a fixed
   location within the IPv6 address. In 6rd it varies, so the size of the SP
   IPv6 prefix is important. Also, in 6rd the SP chooses how many suffix bits
   of the IPv4 prefix are used in the algorithm to create the IPv6 prefix for
   its subscribers. This allows the SP to adjust the balance between IPv6
   addresses used by the 6rd mechanism, and how many are left to be delegated
   to end user sites. To allow for stateless address auto-configuration and
   sub delegation a 6rd delegated prefix MUST be shorter than a /64.</t>

   <t>The 6rd Delegated Prefix is created by concatenating the 2 items above
   in order. The sum of the number of bits used by each determines the size
   of the prefix that is delegated to the 6rd CE router for use by the
   customer site.</t>

   <figure align="center" anchor="v6address">
     <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[

    /n            + (<= 32)  + (<= 16)   +      64       = 128 bits

| 6rd SP Prefix   |v4 address| Subnet ID |      Interface ID       |
+-----------------+----------+-----------+-------------------------+
|<---6rd Delegated Prefix--->|<---  End user's address space  ---->|

        ]]></artwork></figure>

   <t>For example, if the 6rd SP Prefix is a /28, the v4suffix-length for the
   6rd domain is 24, and we specify a maximum of 16 6rd domains for the
   deployment, the shortest possible delegated IPv6 prefix for each subscriber
   is /56 (28 + 24 + 4 = 56).</t>

   <t>Embedding less than the full 32 bits of an IPv4 address is possible only
   with an aggregated block of IPv4 addresses for a given 6rd SP Prefix. This
   may not be practical for global IPv4 addresses at a given SP, but is quite
   likely in a deployment where private addresses are being assigned to end
   users (for example 10.0.0.0/8). If private addresses overlap within a given
   6rd deployment, the deployment may be subdivided into separate 6rd Domains,
   likely along the same topology lines the NAT-based IPv4 deployment itself
   would also require. In this case, each domain is addressed with a different
   6rd SP Prefix. An implementation MAY expose this to the operator for
   configuration as a single 6rd SP Prefix coupled with a Domain ID which is
   appended to the 6rd SP Prefix during operation.</t>

   <t>Multiple encodings are possible within a single 6rd deployment. For
   example, if global and private IPv4 addresses are used within the same 6rd
   site, and the number of IPv4 bits encoded in the IPv6 Delegated Prefix
   varies between the two (e.g., 32 bits for global, and 24 bits for private),
   then a different 6rd SP Prefix must be used to disambiguate the two
   different encoding settings.</t>

   <t>Since 6rd IPv6 prefixes are selected algorithmically from an IPv4
   address, changing the IPv4 address will cause a change in the IPv6
   delegated prefix which would normally ripple through the site's network
   and be disruptive.  As such, if possible the service provider should
   utilize a long-lived IPv4 address assignment for a given end user. </t>

   <t>6rd IPv6 address assignment and hence the IPv6 service itself is tied
   to the IPv4 address lease (whether set via DHCP, PPP, or otherwise), thus
   the 6rd service is also tied to this in terms of authorization,
   accounting, etc. For example, the 6rd Delegated Prefix has the same DHCP
   lease time as its associated IPv4 address. The prefix lifetimes advertised
   in Router Advertisements or used by DHCP on the 6rd CE LAN side MUST be
   equal or shorter than the IPv4 address lease time.</t>

   <t> For trouble-shooting and traceability, a 6rd IPv6 address and
   the associated IPv4 address for the same site can always be
   determined algorithmically.  This may be useful for referencing
   logs and other data at an SP that may be limited to IPv4 address
   assignment activity.</t>

 </section>
 <section title="Address selection">
   <t>A 6rd delegated prefix is a native IPv6 prefix in the LAN-side of 6rd
   CE. For the purpose of source and destination address selection the prefix
   should be treated as native IPv6 and no changes to
   the <xref target="RFC3484">source address selection or destination address
   selection policy table</xref> is needed.</t>

   prefix).</t>

   <t> This information can be configured into the device in a variety of ways
   including manual configuration. DHCP and IPCP are defined here, other
   automatic provisioning protocols may be used as well.</t>

 <section anchor="relays" title="Provisioning the Service Provider 6rd Border Relay">

   <t>As the 6rd IPv4 relay address is configurable, there is no need for a
   well known anycast address as specified
   in <xref target="RFC3068">RFC3068</xref>. For increased reliability and
   load-balancing, the relay address can be an anycast address shared by all
   of the SP BRs for a given 6rd Domain. As 6rd is stateless, any BR may be
   used at any time. The 6rd relay MUST use its anycast IPv4 address as the
   source address in packets relayed via the SP network to the 6rd CE
   router.</t>

   <t>Since 6rd uses provider address space, no specific routes need to be
   advertised externally for 6rd to work, neither in IPv6 nor IPv4
   BGP. However, the 6rd IPv4 relay anycast addresses must be advertised in
   the providers IGP.</t>

   <t>This example show how the 6rd prefix is created based on a /32 IPv6
   prefix with a private IPv4 address were the first octet is "compressed"
   out:</t>

      SP prefix: 2001:0DB8::/32
      6rd IPv4 prefix: 10.0.0.0/8
      6rd CE router IPv4 address: 10.100.100.1
      6rd site IPv6 prefix: 2001:0DB8:6464:0100::/56
        ]]></artwork></figure>

 <section anchor="encaps" title="Encapsulation considerations">
   <t>IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation is done as specified in
   6to4 <xref target="RFC3056"></xref> and in <xref target="RFC4213">Basic
   Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers</xref>.</t>

   <t>IPv6 packets from a 6rd CE router are encapsulated in IPv4 packets when
   they leave the site via its 6rd CE WAN side interface. The Subscriber IPv4
   address MUST be configured to send and receive packets on this
   interface.</t>

   <t>MTU and fragmentation issues for IPv6 in IPv4 tunnelling is discussed in
   detail in section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC4213"> RFC4213</xref>. 6rd's
   scope is limited to a service provider network. If the MTU is well-managed
   such that the IPv4 MTU on the 6rd CE WAN interface is set so that no
   fragmentation occurs within the boundary of the SP, then the IPv6 MTU
   should be set to the IPv4 MTU minus the size of the encapsulating IPv4
   header (20 bytes). IPv4 Path MTU discovery MAY be used to adjust the MTU of
   the tunnel as described in section 3.2.2 of <xref target="RFC4213">
   RFC4213</xref> or the IPv6 tunnel MTU may be explicitly configured.</t>

   <t>The IPv6 tunnel MTU, whether determined automatically or configured
   directly, SHOULD be advertised on the LAN-side by setting the MTU option
   in <xref target="RFC4861">Router Advertisements</xref> messages to the
   IPv6 tunnel MTU.</t>

   <section anchor="receiving_rules" title="Receiving Rules">
     <t>In order to prevent spoofing of IPv6 addresses, the BR and CE MUST
     validate the source address of the encapsulated IPv6 packet with the
     address of the IPv4 it is encapsulated by. If the addresses do not match,
     the packet is dropped.</t>

     <t>The 6rd CE router should drop packets received on the 6rd virtual
     interface for destinations not covered by the 6rd Delegated prefix.</t>
   </section>
 </section>

 <section title="Transition Considerations">
   <t>6rd is intended to deliver a production-level service to customer
   sites. Once 6rd IPv6 access is available, the SP network can migrate to
   IPv6 at its own pace with little or no affect on the customer. When native
   IPv6 is fully available, the 6rd CE router is provisioned with IPv6 on its
   WAN side. 6rd and native IPv6 can coexist for a time while the customer
   site is adopts the new IPv6 native prefix, and then 6rd
   deprovisioned. Alternatively, the same numbering plan for 6rd may be used
   for the native service, though this might require a "flag day" when the 6rd
   service is turned off and native service is initialized.  </t>

   <t>While 6rd bears resemblance to 6to4 and utilizes the same encapsulation
   and base mechanisms, it is not intended as a replacement for 6to4. Unlike
   6to4, 6rd is for use only in an environment where a service provider
   cooperates closely to deliver the IPv6 service.  6to4 routes with the
   2002::/16 prefix may exist alongside 6rd in the 6rd CE router, and doing
   so may offer some efficiencies when communicating directly with 6to4
   routers.</t>

 </section>

 <section title="Address space usage">
   <t>The 6rd prefix is an RIR delegated IPv6 prefix. It must encapsulate an
   IPv4 address and must be short enough so that a /56 or /60 can be given to
   subscribers. Using the full IPv4 address assigning a /56 for subscribers
   would mean that each service provider using 6rd would require a /24 for 6rd
   in addition to other IPv6 address needs they have. Assuming that 6rd would
   be stunningly successful and taken up by almost all AS number holders (32K)
   then the total address usage of 6rd would be equivalent to a /9. If instead
   delegated /60s to subscribers the service provider would require a /28 and
   the total global address consumption by 6rd would be equivalent to a
   /13. Again, this assumes that 6rd is used by all AS number holders in the
   IPv4 Internet today at the same time, and that none have moved to native
   IPv6 and reclaimed the 6rd space which was being used.</t>

   <t>As 6rd uses service provider address space, 6rd uses the normal address
   delegation a service provider gets from its RIR and no global allocation of
   a single 6rd address block like for example the 6to4 2002::/16 is
   needed.</t>

   <t>The 6rd address block can be reclaimed when all users of it has
   transitioned out of it into native IPv6 service. This requires renumbering
   and usage of additional address space during the transition period.</t>

   <t>To alleviate concerns about address usage 6rd allows for leaving out
   redundant IPv4 prefix bits in the encoding of the IPv4 address inside the
   6rd IPv6 address. This is most useful where the IPv4 address space is very
   well aggregated. For example to provide each customer with a /60, if a
   service provider has all its IPv4 customers under a /12 then only 20 bits
   needs to be used to encode the IPv4 address and the service provider would
   only need a /40 IPv6 allocation for 6rd. If private address space is used
   then a 10/8 would require a /36. If multiple 10/8 domains are used then up
   to 16 could be supported within a /32.</t>

 <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
   <t>A 6to4 router as specified in <xref target="RFC3056">RFC 3056</xref> can
   be used as an open relay. It can be used to relay IPv6 traffic and as a
   traffic anonymizer. By restricting the 6rd Domain to within a provider
   network a 6rd CE router only needs to accept packets from a single or small
   set of known 6rd relay routers. As such many of the threats against 6to4 as
   described in
     <xref target="RFC3964">RFC3964</xref> do not apply.</t>

   <t>When applying the receiving rules
   <xref target="receiving_rules"></xref> IPv6 packets are as well protected
   against spoofing as IPv4 packets are within an SP network.</t>

   <t>A malicious user that is aware of a 6rd domain and the 6rd BR IPv4
   address could use this information to construct a packet that would cause a
   Border Relay Router to reflect tunneled packets outside of the domain that
   it is serving. If the attacker constructs the packet accordingly, and can
   inject a packet with an IPv6 source address that looks as if it originates
   from within the 6rd domain of the second border relay, routing loops
   between 6rd domains may be created, allowing the malicious user to launch a
   packet amplification attack between 6rd domains.</t>

   <t>One possible mitigation for this is to simply not allow the 6rd BR IPv4
   address to be reachable from outside the SP's 6rd domain. In this case,
   carefully constructed IPv6 packets still may be reflected off a single BR,
   but the looping condition will not occur.</t>
