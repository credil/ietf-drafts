Abstract

   This memo defines a new suboption of the DHCP relay information
   option which allows the DHCP relay to specify a new value for the
   Server Identifier option, which is inserted by the DHCP Server.  This
   allows the DHCP relay to act as the actual DHCP server such that
   RENEW DHCPREQUESTs will come to the relay instead of going to the
   server directly.  This gives the relay the opportunity to include the

   Relay Agent option with appropriate suboptions even on DHCP RENEW

Internet-Draft        Server ID Override Suboption          October 2006


1.  Introduction

   There are many situations where the DHCP relay is involved and can
   insert a relay agent option with appropriate suboptions easily into
   DHCP DISCOVER messages.  Once the lease has been granted, however,
   future DHCP RENEWAL messages are sent directly to the DHCP Server as
   specified in the Server Identifier option.  This means that the relay
   may not see the DHCP RENEWAL messages (depending upon network
   topology) and thus can not provide the same relay agent option
   information in the RENEWAL messages.

   This new DHCP relay agent suboption, Server Identifier override,
   allows the relay to tell the DHCP server what value to place into the
   Server Identifier option.  Using this, the relay agent can force
   RENEWAL messages to come to it instead of the server.  The relay may
   then insert the relay agent option with appropriate suboptions and
   relay the DHCPREQUEST to the actual server.  In this fashion the DHCP
   server will be provided with the same relay agent information upon
   renewals (such as Circuit-ID, Remote-ID, Device Class, etc.) as was
   provided in the initial DISCOVER message.  In effect, this makes a
   RENEWAL into a REBINDING.

   This new suboption could also be used by the DHCP relay in order to
   allow the relay to appear as the actual DHCP server to the client.
   This has the advantage that the relay can more easily keep up-to-date
   information about leases granted, etc.

   In short, this new suboption allows the DHCPv4 relay to function in
   the same fashion as the DHCPv6 relay currently does.

3.  Server Identifier Override Suboption Definition

   The format of the suboption is:

   Code   Len    Overriding Server Identifier address
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   | TBD |  n  | a1  | a2  | a3  | a4  |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+


                                 Figure 1

   The option length (n) is 4.  The octets "a1" through "a4" specify the
   value which MUST be inserted into the Server Identifier option by the
   DHCP Server upon reply.

   DHCP Servers which implement this Relay Suboption MUST use this
   value, if present, as the value to insert into the Server Identifier
   option whenever responding to a DHCP Client.

   If a DHCP Server does not understand/implement this Relay Suboption,
   it will ignore the Suboption, and thus will insert it's own
   appropriate interface address as the Server Identifier address.  In
   this case, the DHCP Relay will not receive RENEW DHCPREQUEST packets
   from the client.  When configuring a DHCP Relay to use this
   Suboption, the administrator of the Relay should take into account
   whether or not the DHCP Server to which the packet will be relayed
   will correctly understand this Suboption.

   When servicing a DHCPREQUEST packet the DHCP Server would normally
   look at the Server Identifier option for verification that the
   address specified there is one of the addresses associated with the
   DHCP Server, silently ignoring the DHCPREQUEST if it does not match a
   configured DHCP Server interface address.  If the DHCPREQUEST packet
   contains a Server Identifier Override Suboption, however, comparison
   should be made between this suboption and the Server Identifier
   option.  If both of the Server Identifier Override Suboption and the
   Server Identifier Option specify the same address, then the Server
   should accept the DHCPREQUEST packet for processing, regardless of
   whether or not the Server Identifier Option matchs a DHCP Server
   interface.

   The DHCP Relay should fill in the giaddr field when relaying the
   packet just as it normally would do.

   In a situation where the DHCP Relay is configured to forward packets
   to more than one server, the DHCP Relay should forward all DHCP
   packets all servers.  This applies to DHCP RENEW packets as well.

   The intent is that the DHCP Relay should not need to maintain state
   information about the DHCP lease.

   DHCP Relays using this suboption SHOULD also implement and use the
   DHCPv4 Relay Agent Flags Suboption [7] in order to specify whether
   the DHCP Relay received the original packet as a broadcast or
   unicast.  The DHCP Server receiving a packet containing the Server
   Identifier Override Suboption may use this additional information in
   processing the packet.

   Note that if the DHCP Relay becomes inaccessible by the DHCP Client
   or loses network access to the DHCP Server, further DHCP RENEW
   packets from the DHCP Client may not be properly processed and the
   DHCP Client's lease may time out.

4.  Security Considerations

   Message authentication in DHCP for intradomain use where the out-of-
   band exchange of a shared secret is feasible is defined in [3].
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP
   protocol specification in [2].

   The DHCP Relay Agent option depends on a trusted relationship between
   the DHCP relay agent and the server, as described in section 5 of RFC
   3046.  While the introduction of fraudulent relay-agent options can
   be prevented by a perimeter defense that blocks these options unless
   the relay agent is trusted, a deeper defense using the authentication
   option for relay agent options [4] SHOULD be deployed as well.

   If a rogue DHCP relay were inserted between the client and the
   server, it could redirect clients to it using this suboption.  This
   would allow such a system to later deny RENEW DHCPREQUEST and thus
   force clients to discontinue use of their allocated address.  This
   interception, however, would need to be done during the initial
   DISCOVER and OFFER phase, since the suboption value SHOULD be ignored
   by the server during RENEWAL state.  Either DHCP Authentication [3]
   or DHCP Relay Agent option authentication [4] would address this
   case.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a suboption number for the Server
   Identifier Override Suboption from the DHCP Relay Agent Information
   Option [3] suboption number space.  None.
