Internet-Draft           PMIP Route Optimization           February 2008


Abstract

   This draft describes a light weight route optimization technique that
   helps to optimize the media path between two communicating nodes when
   Proxy MIP is used as the mobility protocol.  This routing
   optimization technique is most useful when the two communicating
   hosts are away from home and need to communicate with each other
   using an optimized path.  It takes advantage of the data packet
   between LMA and MAG to set up the optimized data path between the
   communicating hosts.  This route optimization technique is applicable
   to both the intra-LMA and inter-LMA scenarios.

Internet-Draft           PMIP Route Optimization           February 2008


1.  Introduction

   Wireless Service Providers (WISPs) strive to provide secured and
   seamless connectivity to the roaming users.  When a mobile is
   subjected to repeated handoff, quality of existing communication gets
   degraded due to delay and packet loss.  There are several transition
   events during the handoff, such as discovery, configuration,
   authentication, security association, binding update and media
   redirection that contribute to the handoff delay and the associated
   packet loss.  This specific route optimization technique reduces the
   delay due to media delivery by reducing the media traversal path
   between the communicating hosts.

   In order to reduce the delay due to binding update and associated
   one-way-delay of the media, when a mobile's movement is confined to a
   specific domain, various local mobility management protocols have
   been designed.  These include Cellular IP, HAWAII, IDMP, HMIPv6 etc.
   NETLMM working group within IETF has recommended a set of goals and
   host requirements to support localized mobility [RFC4830], [RFC4831],
   [RFC4832].  Based on these goals, IETF has currently designed Proxy
   MIPv6 protocol [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6] that helps to reduce the
   delay due to long binding update.  It takes much of the burden away
   from the mobile and puts it on the wired access routers within the
   network that are called Media Access Gateway (MAG).  MAG is equipped
   with proxy mobility agent (PMA) that sends the binding update to the
   home agents on behalf of the mobiles.  Each mobile is anchored with a
   certain MAG until it hands off to a new MAG.  The PMIPv6-based
   mobility protocol is preferred when mobility is confined within a
   domain and wireless service providers do not want to overload the
   mobile nodes stack by setting up a tunnel between the mobile and the
   LMA.  A tunnel is not desirable on the mobile node because it adds
   extra processing and bandwidth constraints to the wireless hop.

   Although Proxy Mobile IP provides optimization compared to other
   global mobility protocols, it still needs improvement in certain
   areas such as route optimization.  Route optimization reduces the
   delay due to media delivery between the two communicating mobiles by
   reducing the traversal distance of the media packets between the
   communicating hosts.  Some of the requirements for route optimization
   are mentioned in [I-D.jeong-netlmm-pmipv6-roreq].  There are also few
   proposals that have discussed route optimization for Proxy MIPv6,
   [I-D.abeille-netlmm-proxymip6ro] and [I-D.qin-netlmm-pmipro].  These
   mechanisms either depend on the MIPv6 route optimization procedures
   or introduce a heavy weight route setup procedure to obtain the
   desired optimization.  In this draft we describe a light weigth route
   optimization technique for PMIP that will further improve the
   effectiveness of PMIP for both intra-domain and inter-domain
   movement.  This technique takes advantage of the the data packet and

2.  Terminology


   Binding Cache Entry:  A binding cache in the network entity that
      provides the route information about a communicatin node.  BCE can
      exist either within an LMA or in the MAG.


   Route Optimization:  Route optimization is a mechanism by which the
      data path is from CN to MN is optimized.


   Proxy Binding Update:  A procedure to update the identifier of the
      mobile by a third party.  In the context of PMIPv6, MAG sends the
      binding update to LMA on behalf of the mobile.


   Local Mobility Agent (LMA):  Local mobility agent is the local home
      agent that is responsible to maintain the binding cache of the
      mobile when the mobile's movement is confined to a domain.  LMA
      actually does the job of a Home Agent, and thus has be used
      interchangeably in the document.


   Media Access Gateway:  MAG is the first hop access router that is
      equipped with the Proxy Mobility Agent (PMA).  MAG sends the proxy
      binding update on behalf of the mobile.  MAG stores the binding
      cache entry created by Correspondent Binding Update (CBU) message,
      so that it can forward the traffic to the neighboring MAG without
      sending it to HA (LMA).  MAG has been used interchangeably with
      AGW in the document.


   Access Gateway (AGW):  AGW is the first hop access router that is
      equipped with the Proxy Mobility Agent (PMA).  AGW sends the proxy
      binding update on behalf of the mobile.  AGW been used
      interchangeably with MAG in this draft.


   Proxy Mobility Agent (PMA):  PMA is the proxy mobility agent that
      resides in each of the access routers that are within a mobility
      domain.  PMA helps to send proxy binding update to LMA on behalf
      of the mobile.

Internet-Draft           PMIP Route Optimization           February 2008


   Correspondent Binding  Update:

      Binding update message that updates the route in the neighboring
      MAGs for route optimization.  This CBU update can be between the
      LMA and MAG or between the MAGs.  This helps to update the route
      cache on the AGWs, so that they can route the packet based on
      mobile's destination.


   Correspondent Binding  Cache:

      Correspondent Binding Cache (CBC) is formed at the MAGs when
      Correspondent Binding Update (CBU) message is received from the
      LMA or other MAG.  CBC usually has associated timer that helps it
      to expire after a while.

3.  Applicable Scenarios for Route Optimization

   We describe below two PMIP-based scenarios where the route
   optimization technique can be applied.  This can primarily be divided
   as Intra-LMA and Inter-LMA.  The proposed route optimization
   technique can be applied to both of these scenarios.

   Figure 1 shows a general PMIP architecture with all the PMIPv6
   components.  In this case the MAGs do not need to be adjacent to each
   other but can be connected to a core network and thus can be few hops
   away.  Similarly, MAG and LMA also do not need to be adjacent.  Route
   optimization technique offers the best advantage when the LMA is far
   way from the communicating hosts.

   Figure 2 shows a scenario where both the mobiles are in two different
   PMIP domains.  MAG1, MAG2, MAG3 are under LMA1 and MAG4, MAG5 and
   MAG6 are under LMA2.  In this case, route optimization needs to take
   place when the mobile is in under MAG4 and then it makes a movement
   to MAG5.

4.  Route Optimization Techniques

   In this section, we describe a light weight route optimization
   technique for PMIPv6 and apply it to both Intra-LMA and Inter-LMA
   scenarios.  This route optimization technique takes advantage of the
   initial data packet to set the route optimization without the need
   for any additional route setup procedures.

4.1.  Intra-LMA route optimization

   In this section we describe intra-LMA scenarios.  We give
   illustration of route optimization for data between MN1 and MN2 in
   both directions.

4.1.1.  Initial State

   In this section we discuss several call flows for intra-LMA route
   optimization.

4.1.1.1.  Route Optimization from MN1 to MN2

   Figure 3 shows the flows associated with the route optimization when
   a single LMA is used.  It shows the route optimization scenario when
   the mobile is in the initial stage and has not moved.  Initially, MN1
   is under MAG1 and MN2 is under MAG2, but MN2 moves to MAG3 when the
   communication session is active.

         Figure 3: Route optimization in Single LMA:Initial State

   We explain the path optimization from MN1 to MN2.  Before the
   handover takes place, MN1 attaches to MAG1 (MAG1) and then the Proxy
   Mobility Agent within MAG1 sends a binding update to the LMA on
   behalf of MN1.  Similarly, MN2 connects to MAG2 (PMA2), that triggers
   the proxy-BU to the LMA on behalf of MN2.  We then show the
   optimization procedure.  First packet from MN1 to MN2 is tunneled to
   the LMA.  As soon as the LMA gets this packet, it knows how to
   forward packet to MAG2, but at the same time, it also sends a CB
   Update (CBU) to MAG1 notifying that MAG2 is the PMA for MN2.  On

   receiving the CBU, MAG1 keeps a cache that maps MAG2 with MN2.  Thus,
   any subsequent packet from MN1 destined to MN2 gets intercepted by
   MAG1 and is forwarded to MAG2, instead of being forwarded to the LMA.
   Trajectory of the optimized packet looks like, MN1->MAG1->MAG2->MN2
   instead of MN1->MAG1->LMA->MAG2->MN2, thus optimizing the media route
   between MN1 and MN2.

4.1.1.2.  Optimization from MN2 to MN1

   Similalrly, Figure 4 shows the path optimization from MN2 to MN1 when
   the MN2 is in the initial stage and has not handed over yet.  This
   illustrates how this route optimization technique can be applied to
   optimize media traffic in either direction.

4.1.2.  Route Optimization after handoff

   In this section, we illustrate how the route optimization takes place
   after the mobile moves to another AGW (AGW3) under the same LMA
   (LMA1).  We consider the media delivery from both MN1 to MN2 and
   vice-versa.

4.1.2.1.  Route optimization from MN1 to MN2

   In this section, we show how the media route is optimized from MN1 to
   MN2, after MN2 moves from its current location.

          Figure 5: Single LMA: Route  Optimization after handoff

   Figure 5 shows the flow when MN2 makes a handover from MAG2 to AGW3.
   It shows the route optimization procedure and optimized route from
   MN1 to MN2 after MN2 hands over to a new PMA such as AGW3.  In this
   case, MN2 attaches with AGW3 and sends a proxy BU to LMA.  At that
   point, LMA immediately sends a Route Optimization Update to MAG2,
   since the LMA has the knowledge of MAG2.  MAG2 in turn sends a proxy
   BU to MAG1 telling that MN2 is under MAG3.  Thus, both MAG1 and MAG2
   are made aware of the fact that MN2 is currently connected to MAG3.
   During this procedure if any data from MN1 destined to MN2 arrives at
   MAG1, MAG1 forwards it to MAG2 which in turn forwards it to MAG3.

   MAG3 finally forwards it MN2.  But once the route optimization
   procedure is over, any data destined from MN1 to MN2 gets intercepted
   by MAG1 and then directly gets forwarded to AGW3 which forwards it
   again to MN2.

4.1.2.2.  Route Optimization from MN2 to MN1

   In this section, we show how data path is optimized between MN2 and
   MN1 after the MN2 has handed over to AGW3 during communication
   session.

   optimization is over, data from MN2 destined to MN1 gets picked up by
   AGW3 which finally sends to the MAG1 to be delivered to MN1.  During

   the route optimization procedure, however the first packet gets
   routed via LMA and is subjected to little delay.These techniques thus
   avoid the route from LMA to AGWs and forward the traffic from one AGW
   (MAG) to another AGW (MAG).  However the first packet is not
   subjected to route optimization.

4.2.  Inter-LMA route optimization

4.2.1.  Initial state

   In this section, we describe the route optimization procedure when
   the communicating mobiles are under two different LMA domains.
   Figure 7 shows a typical inter-LMA handoff procedure.  Initially, the
   mobile is anchored at MAG1 (MAG1) that is under LMA1, and MN2 is
   anchored at AGW4 which is under LMA2.  First packet from MN1 to MN2
   traverses via LMA1 and LMA2, and gets delivered to MN2.  When the
   first packet is traversed, LMA2 sends Correspondent Binding Update
   message to LMA1, LMA1 in turn sends it back to MAG1 to update the
   binding cache entry.  At this point MAG1 keeps a cache entry for MN2.
   Thus any subsequent packet does not travel via LMA1 and LMA2 any more
   but is forwarded from MAG1 (MAG1) to AGW4 (MAG4) where the mobile
   resides.  Thus, any further data packet during this communication
   session is optimized until the mobile moves away from AGW4.

4.2.2.  Route optimization after handoff

   This section shows the route optimization procedure after the mobile
   has handed over to AGW5 (MAG5) that is under LMA2.  Figure 8 shows
   the call flow of the route optimization procedure.  As soon as the
   mobile gets connected to AGW5, LMA2 gets notified and it sends a CB
   update to AGW4 notifying that the mobile is under AGW5.  Thus the
   first packet after the handover still flows from MAG1 to AGW4 that
   forwards this packet to AGW5, AGW5 in turn delivers the packet to
   MN2.  As it is shown the path is not optimized.  At this time, AGW4
   notifies MAG1 about the existence of MN2 under its attachment.  Thus,
   any subsequent packet from MN1 and MN2 flows using the route
   optimized path, MN1->MAG1->MAG5->MN2.

           Figure 8: Inter-LMA route  optimization after handoff

   It is to be noted that Inter-LMA CBU needs to carry the IP addres of
   the source and destination hosts in addition to the address of source
   MAG.  This is needed as the LMA1 needs to determine which MAG it
   needs to send the CBU back.  Thus, new mobility option type needs to
   be added to the CBU message.

6.  Security Considerations

   The CB update (CBU) messages need to be secured.  Since mobile's
   movement is constrained within a domain, these route optimization
   update messages can use the existing security mechanism that is in
   place as part of ProxyMIP deployment.  It is assumed that there is
   standard security mechanism in place between the MAGs (Media Access
   Gateway) and between MAG and LMA.  Thus, the CB update messages can
   be protected accordingly.
