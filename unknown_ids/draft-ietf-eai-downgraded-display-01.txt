1.  Introduction

   The Email Address Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension document
   set [RFC4952] [RFC5336] [RFC5335] [RFC5337] expands Email address
   structure, syntax and Email header format.  To avoid bouncing
   internationalized Email messages, the downgrading mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-eai-downgrade] converts an internationalized message to a
   traditional Email message when a server in the delivery path does not
   support the UTF8SMTP extension.  The downgraded message is a
   traditional Email message, except the message has "Downgraded-"
   header fields.

   A perfect reverse-function of the downgrading does not exist because
   the encoding defined in [RFC2047] is not exactly reversible and
   Received header field downgrading may remove FOR clause information.
   The restoration of the downgrading should be done once at the final
   destination of the downgraded message such as MUAs or IMAP servers.
   This document describes the restoration methods as displaying
   downgraded messages in MUAs.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Specialized terms used in this specification are defined in the EAI
   overview [RFC4952] or in [RFC5321][RFC5322], MIME documents [RFC2045]
   [RFC2047] [RFC2183] [RFC2231].

   This document depends on [RFC5335] and [I-D.ietf-eai-downgrade].  Key
   words used in these document are used in this document, too.

   The term "non-ASCII" is an UTF-8 string which contains at least one
   non-ASCII character.

   The term "address header field" is used for a header field which
   contains <mailbox> elements which is defined in [RFC5322].  "Address
   header fields" contain "From", "Sender", "Reply-To", "To", "Cc",
   "Bcc", "Resent-From", "Resent-Sender", "Resent-To", "Resent-Cc",
   "Return-Path" header fields.

   An "UTF8SMTP message" is an Email messages expanded by [RFC5335].

   The term "MIME decode" is used for both "encoded-word" decoding
   defined by [RFC2047] and MIME parameter value decoding defined by
   [RFC2231].

3.  Consideration of displaying downgraded message

   Displaying downgraded message is mostly performed by MIME decoding
   according to [RFC2047] and [RFC2231].  Result of MIME decoding, the
   header of the message still contains Downgraded-*: header fields, but
   the header field bodies are MIME decoded.  These decoded
   "Downgraded-" header fields contain the original header field name
   and the original header field values.  The recipient can read them.
   But the recipient's MUA cannot use the original header fields
   automatically.

   Additionally, MUAs can process "Downgraded-" header fields.

   The easiest way to process "Downgraded-" header fields is to remove
   "Downgraded-" from the decoded "Downgraded-" header fields' name.
   Then, the "address header fields" may be displayed twice, one is from
   downgraded header field and the other is from decoded "Downgraded-"
   header field.  Although it is very easy, it MUST NOT be used because
   of the following reasons.
   o  [RFC5322] section 3.6 defines number of times each field may occur
      in the header section of a message and the maximum number for
      "From", "Sender", "To", "Cc", "Bcc" header fields is 1.  It
      violates [RFC5322].
   o  Users cannot distinguish which is the original downgraded header
      field and which is the generated header field.
   o  The Downgraded-* header field and corresponding header field may
      not have relations.

   The following way is to remove "Downgraded-" from the decoded
   "Downgraded-" header fields' name and remove the corresponding header
   field at the same time.


4.  Displaying downgraded message

   MUAs may decode and re-generate the original header fields of the
   message.  This procedure may reconstruct the original message from
   the downgraded message.  But it is not guaranteed.

   Displaying downgraded message is implemented by the following steps.

   Step 1:   Select Address header field preservation headers described
      in Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-eai-downgrade].  Target header fields
      are "Downgraded-From", "Downgraded-Sender", "Downgraded-To",
      "Downgraded-Cc", "Downgraded-Bcc", "Downgraded-Reply-To",
      "Downgraded-Resent-From", "Downgraded-Resent-Sender", "Downgraded-
      Resent-To", "Downgraded-Resent-Cc", "Downgraded-Resent-Bcc",
      "Downgraded-Resent-Reply-To", "Downgraded-Return-Path" and

Internet-Draft       Displaying Downgraded Messages           March 2009


      "Downgraded-Disposition-Notification-To" header fields.

   Step 2:   Generate new header field which field name is the original
      header field name and the field value is the MIME decoded header
      field value from the output of Step 1.

   Step 3:   Apply Email header fields downgrading defined in section 5
      of [I-D.ietf-eai-downgrade] to the output of Step 2 without re-
      generating "Downgraded-" header fields.

   Step 4:   Compare the output of Step 3 and the original header
      fields.  If the same header fields exist for the output of Step 3
      and the original header fields, remove the same header fields from
      the original header fields.  This step outputs the original header
      fields which is modified by this step 4.  Before this comparison,
      a canonicalization described below is useful.

      1.  Unfold all header field continuation lines as described in
          [RFC5322].
      2.  Insert a space character before and after <mailbox-list>
          separator "," if there is no space character.
      3.  Insert a space character before and after <comment> if there
          is no space character.
      4.  Decode each <encoded-word> whose charset is 'UTF-8'.
      5.  Convert all sequences of one or more WSP characters to a
          single space character.  WSP characters here include those
          before and after a line folding boundary.
      6.  Delete all WSP characters at the end of each unfolded header
          field value.
      7.  Delete any WSP characters remaining before and after the colon
          separating the header field name from the header field value.
          The colon separator MUST be retained.

   Step 5:   Decode MIME encoded header fields and MIME body part header
      fields according to [RFC2047] and [RFC2231].

   Step 6:  For each "Downgraded-" header field except the address
      header field preservation headers and the envelope information
      preservation headers described in [I-D.ietf-eai-downgrade] section
      3, generate new header field which field name is the original
      header field name and the field value is the decoded header field
      value, then replace the original "Downgraded-" header field by the
      generated header field.

      Don't change "Downgraded-Mail-From" and "Downgraded-Rcpt-To"
      header fields because they do not have their original header
      fields.  Don't change the address header field preservation header
      if it doesn't have the corresponding downgraded header field.

5.  Security considerations

   While displaying downgraded message changes the header fields of the
   message and it may lose the original information, MUAs should have a
   function to read the original received message (with/without MIME
   decoding).

   While information in any email header should usually treated with
   some suspicion, current email systems commonly employ various
   mechanisms and protocols to make the information more trustworthy.
   For example, an organization's boundary MTA can modify From: lines so
   that messages arriving from outside the organization are easily
   distinguishable from internal emails.  As a result of rewriting, the
   Downgraded-From header field may not be decoded.

   See "Security considerations" section in [I-D.ietf-eai-downgrade] and
   [RFC4952] for more discussion.
