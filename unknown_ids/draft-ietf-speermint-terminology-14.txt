1. Introduction 

   The term "Voice over IP Peering" (VoIP Peering) has   historically 
   been used to describe a wide variety of aspects pertaining to the 
   interconnection of service provider networks and to the delivery of 
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP [2]) call termination over those 
   interconnections. 

   The discussion of these interconnections has at times been confused 
   by the fact that the term "peering" is used in various contexts to 
   relate to interconnection at different levels in a protocol stack. 
   Session Peering for Multimedia Interconnect focuses on how to 
   identify and route real-time sessions (such as VoIP calls) at the 
   application layer, and it does not (necessarily) involve the exchange 
   of packet routing data or media sessions. In particular, "layer 5 
   network" is used here to refer to the interconnection between SIP 
   servers, as opposed to interconnection at the IP layer ("layer 3").  
   The term "peering" will be used throughout the remainder of the 
   document for the purpose of indicating a layer 5 interconnection.

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology           December 2007 
 
 
   This document introduces standard terminology for use in 
   characterizing real-time session peering. Note however, that while 
   this document is primarily targeted at the VoIP peering case, the 
   terminology described here is applicable to those cases in which 
   service providers peer using SIP signaling (defined as SIP Service 
   Providers, See Section 3.9) for non-voice or quasi-real-time 
   communications. 

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Section 2 
   provides the general context for the SPEERMINT Working Group. Section 
   3 provides the general definitions for real-time SIP based 
   communication, with initial focus on the VoIP peering case, and 
   Section 4 defines the terminology describing the various forms of 
   peering. Finally, Section 5 introduces the concept of federations. 

2.  SPEERMINT Context 

   Figure 1 depicts the general session peering context (Not in 
   chronological order). Note that vertical axis in this figure 
   describes the layering of identifiers, while the horizontal lines 
   indicate working group scope. While the SPEERMINT working group is 
   not limited (or coupled in any way) to the use of E.164 numbers, in 
   the case shown here an E.164 number [5] is used as a key in an E.164 
   to Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) mapping (ENUM [4]). The result 
   of this step (which involves looking up Naming Authority Pointer 
   (NAPTR) records in the DNS) is a SIP URI, on which the subsequent 
   call routing is based. Note that the call routing step does not 
   depend on the presence of an E.164 number. Indeed, the resulting SIP 
   URI may no longer even contain numbers of any type. In particular, 
   the SIP URI can be advertised in various other ways, such as on a web 
   page.

                  Figure 1: Session Peering Context 

   Note that in Figure 1, Session Establishment Data (SED), is the data 
   used to route a call to the called domain's ingress point (see 
   Section 3.3 for additional detail). 

   As illustrated in Figure 1, the ENUM Working Group is primarily 
   concerned with identifying a SIP URI that corresponds to a given 
   E.164 number, while the SPEERMINT Working Group is concerned with 
   using that SIP URI to acquire the SED and on the use of such SED in 
   routing session signaling requests.  Importantly, the SIP URI can be 
   derived from ENUM (i.e., an E.164 DNS entry) or via any other 
   mechanism available to the user. 

   Finally, note that the term "call" is being used here in the most 
   general sense, i.e., call routing and session routing are used 
   interchangeably. 

3. General Definitions 

3.1. Signaling Path Border Element 

   A signaling path border element (SBE) provides signaling functions 
   such as protocol inter-working (for example, H.323 to SIP), identity 
   and topology hiding, and Call Admission Control (CAC) for a domain. 
   Such an SBE is frequently (but need not be) deployed on a domain's 
   border. 

3.2. Data Path Border Element 

   A data path border element (DBE) provides media-related functions 
   such as deep packet inspection and modification, media relay, and 

 
 
Malas & Meyer            Expires June 5, 2008                  [Page 4] 
Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology           December 2007 
 
 
   firewall support under SBE control. As was the case with the SBE, a 
   DBE is frequently deployed on a domain's border. 

3.3. Session Establishment Data 

   Session Establishment Data, or SED, is the data used to route a call 
   to the next hop associated with the called domain's ingress point. A 
   domain's ingress point can be thought of as the location derived from 
   the NAPTR/SRV/A record [1] that resulted from the resolution of the 
   SIP URI. 

   More specifically, the SED is the set of parameters that the outgoing 
   SBEs need to complete the call, and may include: 

     . A destination SIP URI 

     . A SIP proxy or ingress SBE to send the INVITE to, including 

          o  Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) 

          o  Port 

          o  Transport Protocol (UDP/TCP/TLS [9/10/11]) 

     . Security Parameters, including 

          o  TLS certificate to use 

          o  TLS certificate to expect 

          o  TLS certificate verification setting 

     . Optional resource control parameters such as 

          o  Limits on the total number of call initiations to a peer 

          o  Limits on SIP transactions/second 

3.4. Call Routing 

   Call routing is the set of processes and rules used to route a call 
   and any subsequent mid-dialog SIP requests to their proper (SIP) 
   destination.  More generally, call routing can be thought of as the 
   set of processes and rules, which are used to route a real-time 
   session to its termination point.

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology           December 2007 
 
 
3.5. PSTN 

   The term "PSTN" refers to the Public Switched Telephone Network. In 
   particular, the PSTN refers to the collection of interconnected 
   circuit-switched voice-oriented public telephone networks, both 
   commercial and government-owned.  In general, PSTN terminals are 
   addressed using E.164 numbers; various dial-plans (such as emergency 
   services dial-plans), however, may not directly use E.164 numbers. 

3.6. IP Path 

   For purposes of this document, an IP path is defined to be a sequence 
   of zero or more IP router hops. 

3.7. Peer Network 

   This document defines a peer network as the set of SIP user agents 
   (UAs) (customers) that are controlled by a single administrative 
   domain and can be reached via some IP path. Note that such a peer 
   network may also contain end-users who are located on the PSTN (and 
   hence may also be interconnected with the PSTN), as long as they are 
   also reachable via some IP path. 

3.8. Service Provider 

   A Service Provider (or SP) is defined to be an entity that provides 
   layer 3 (IP) transport of SIP signaling and media packets. Example 
   services may include, but are not limited too, Ethernet Private Line 
   (EPL), Frame Relay, and IP VPN.  An example of this may be an 
   Internet Service Provider (ISP). 

3.9. SIP Service Provider 

   A SIP Service Provider (or SSP) is an entity that provides 
   application services utilizing SIP signaling to its customers. In the 
   event that the SSP is also a function of the SP, it may also provide 
   media streams to its customers.  Such a SSP may additionally be 
   peered with other SSPs. A SSP may also interconnect with the PSTN.  A 
   SSP may also be referred to as an Internet Telephony Service Provider 
   (ITSP). While the terms ITSP and SSP are frequently used 
   interchangeably, this document and other subsequent SIP peering 
   related documents should use the term SSP. SSP more accurately 
   depicts the use of SIP as the underlying layer 5 signaling protocol.  

4. Peering 

   While the precise definition of the term "peering" is the subject of 
   considerable debate, peering in general refers to the negotiation of 

 
 
Malas & Meyer            Expires June 5, 2008                  [Page 6] 
Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology           December 2007 
 
 
   reciprocal interconnection arrangements, settlement-free or 
   otherwise, between operationally independent service providers. 

   This document distinguishes two types of peering, Layer 3 Peering and 
   Layer 5 peering, which are described below. 

4.1. Layer 3 Peering 

   Layer 3 peering refers to interconnection of two service providers' 
   networks for the purposes of exchanging IP packets which destined for 
   one (or both) of the peer's networks. Layer 3 peering is generally 
   agnostic to the IP payload, and is frequently achieved using a 
   routing protocol such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [6] to 
   exchange the required routing information. 

   An alternate, perhaps more operational definition of layer 3 peering 
   is that two peers exchange only customer routes, and hence any 
   traffic between peers terminates on the peer's network or the peer's 
   customer's network. 

4.2. Layer 5 Peering 

   Layer 5 (Session) peering refers to interconnection of two SSPs for 
   the purposes of routing real-time (or quasi-real time) call signaling 
   between their respective customers using SIP methods.  Such peering 
   may be direct or indirect (see Section 4.2.1 and Section 4.2.2 
   below). Note that media streams associated with this signaling (if 
   any) are not constrained to follow the same set of IP paths. 

4.2.1. Direct Peering 

   Direct peering describes those cases in which two SSPs peer without 
   using an intervening layer 5 network. 

4.2.2. Indirect Peering 

   Indirect, or transit, peering refers to the establishment of either a 
   signaling and media path or signaling path alone via one (or more) 
   transit network(s). In this case it is generally required that a 
   trust relationship is established between the originating SSP and the 
   transit network on one side; and, the transit network representing 
   the termination network on the other side. 

4.2.3. Assisted Peering 

   In this case, some entity (usually a 3rd party or federation) 
   provides peering assistance to either the originating or terminating 
   SSP by providing one or more functions (see Section 4.3) assisting in 
   the routing of SIP requests and the establishment of SIP dialogs and 
 
 
Malas & Meyer            Expires June 5, 2008                  [Page 7] 
Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology           December 2007 
 
 
   sessions between peers.  The assisting entity may provide information 
   relating to direct (Section 4.2.1) or indirect (Section 4.2.2) 
   peering as necessary. 

4.2.4. On-demand Peering 

   SSPs are said to peer on-demand when they are able to exchange 
   traffic without any pre-association prior to the origination of a 
   real-time transaction (like a SIP message) between the domains. Any 
   information that needs to be exchanged between domains in support of 
   peering can be learned through a dynamic protocol mechanism.  On-
   demand peering can occur as direct, indirect, or assisted. 

4.2.5. Static Peering 

   SSPs are said to peer statically when pre-association between 
   providers is required for the initiation of any real-time 
   transactions (like a SIP message).  Static peering can occur as 
   direct, indirect, or assisted. 

4.3. Functions 

   The following are terms associated with the functions required for 
   peering. 

4.3.1. Look-Up Function 

   The Look-Up Function (LUF) provides a mechanism for querying an 
   internal and/or external database, which maintains a list of peered 
   host domains. 

4.3.2. Location Function 

   The Location Function (LF) develops SED by discovering the Signaling 
   Function (SF), and SF's reachable host (IP Address and port). 

4.3.3. Signaling Function 

   The SF performs routing of SIP requests for establishing and 
   maintaining calls, and to assist in the discovery/exchange of 
   parameters to be used by the Media Function (MF). 

4.3.4. Media Function 

   The MF performs media related functions such as media transcoding and 
   media security implementation between two SSPs.

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology           December 2007 
 
 
5. Federations 

   A federation is a group of SSPs which agree to receive calls from 
   each other via SIP, and who agree on a set of administrative rules 
   for such calls (settlement, abuse-handling, ...) and the specific 
   rules for the technical details of the peering. 

   A federation may provide some or all of the following functionality: 

     . Common static policies 

          o  Routing 

          o  Domain 

          o  Location 

          o  Next hop 

          o  Network-to-Network Interface (NNI) 

     . Common dynamic policies 

          o  Congestion control 

          o  Codec preference 

          o  Authentication preference 

          o  Quality monitoring capabilities (e.g. RTP Control Protocol 
             (RTCP) [12], RTCP Extended Reports (RTCP XR) [13]) 

     . Policy management (enforcement) 

          o  Ad-hoc 

          o  Published in the DNS, or 

          o  Policy might also be managed by a federation entity 

     . A federated ENUM root 

     . Address resolution mechanisms 

     . Session signaling (via federation policy) 

     . Media streams (via federation policy) 

     . Federation security policies

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology           December 2007 
 
 
     . Peering policies 

     . Other layer 2 and layer 3 policies 

     . Security parameters 

     . Optional resource control parameters 

     Finally, note that a SSP can be a member of 

          o  No federation (e.g., the SSP has only bilateral peering 
             agreements) 

          o  A single federation 

          o  Multiple federations 

     and an SSP can have any combination of bi-lateral and multi-
     lateral (i.e., federated) peers. 

6. Acknowledgments 

   Many of the definitions were gleaned from detailed discussions on the 
   SPEERMINT, ENUM, and SIPPING mailing lists. Scott Brim, Mike Hammer, 
   Eli Katz,  Gaurav Kulshreshtha, Otmar Lendl, Jason Livingood, 
   Alexander Mayrhofer, Jean-Francois Mule, Jonathan Rosenberg, David

   insightful comments to early versions of this draft, and contributed 
   the basis of Figure 1. 

7. Security Considerations 

   This document introduces no new security considerations. However, it 
   is important to note that session peering, as described in this 
   document, has a wide variety of security issues that should be 
   considered in documents addressing both protocol and use case 
   analyzes. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   This document creates no new requirements on IANA namespaces [7].
