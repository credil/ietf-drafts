                       Analysis of 64 Translation
                   draft-penno-behave-64-analysis-00

Abstract

   Due to specific problems, NAT-PT was deprecated by the IETF as a
   mechanism to perform IPv6/IPv4 translation.  Since then, new work has
   commenced which standardizes new mechanisms to perform IPv6/IPv4
   translation.  This document evaluates how the new translation
   mechanisms avoid the problems that caused the IETF to deprecate
   NAT-PT.

Internet-Draft           analysis-64-translation           December 2009


1.  Introduction

   The 64 proposal is widely seen as the next step in the evolution of
   interconnection equipment enabling communication between IPv6 and
   IPv4 only networks.  One fo the building blocks of this proposal is
   decoupling the DNS functionality from protocol NAT.

   This approach is pragmatic in the sense that there is no dependency
   on DNS implementation for the successful functionality of NAT.  As
   long as there is a function (possibly DNS64) that can construct an
   IPv6 address with a fixed prefix and IPv4 address as the suffix,
   NAT64 will work just fine.

   To understand the proposal, we must keep in mind that the focus of
   this proposal is on the deployment and not the implementation
   details.  As long as a NAT64 box confirms to the externally
   behaviour, as desired in the deployment scenario, the details are not
   very important. ".....  A NAT64 MAY perform the steps in a different
   order, or MAY perform different steps, as long as the externally
   visible outcome in the same."

1.1.  Scope

   This document provides an analysis of how the proposed set of
   documents that standardize stateful IPv6 to IPv4 translation and
   replace NAT-PT [RFC2766] address the issues raised in the document
   "Reasons to Move the Network Address Translator - Protocol Translator
   (NAT-PT) to Historic Status" [RFC4966].  These documents, henceforth
   referred as 64, comprise of the following:

   o  NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients
      to IPv4 Servers [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]

   o  DNS64: DNS extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6
      Clients to IPv4 Servers [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64]

   o  IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 TranslatorsFramework for IPv4/IPv6
      Translation [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format]

   o  Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation
      [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework]

   This draft is limited in the sense that hosts from IPv6 network can
   initiate a connection to IPv4 network, but not vice-versa.  This
   corresponds to scenarios 1 and 5 of the document Framework for
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework].  Hence, the scenario of servers
   moving to IPv6 while clients remaining IPv4 remains unaddressed.

   The 64 proposal, just like any other technology under development,
   has some positives and some drawbacks.  The ups and downs of the
   proposal must be clearly understood while going forward with its
   future development.


2.  Analysis of RFC 4966

   Of the set of problems pointed out in RFC4966, the 64 proposal
   addresses some problems, whereas leaves others unaddressed.
   Following is a point by point analysis of the problems.

2.1.  Problems Not Addressed by 64

   Problems discussed in RFC4966, which are not addressed by the 64
   proposal:

   1.   Disruption of all protocols that embed IP addresses (and/or
        ports) in packet payloads or apply integrity mechanisms using IP
        addresses (and ports).



        Discussion: In the case of FTP [RFC0959] this problem is
        addressed by the use of a FTP64 ALG
        [I-D.van-beijnum-behave-ftp64] which is a workaround solution.
        The functioning of other protocols is left unaddressed.

   2.   Inability to redirect traffic for protocols that lack
        demultiplexing capabilities or are not built on top of specific
        transport-layer protocols for transport address translations.

   3.   Loss of information due to incompatible semantics between IPv4
        and IPv6 versions of headers and protocols.

   4.   Need for additional state and/or packet reconstruction in
        dealing with packet fragmentation.  Otherwise, implement no
        support for fragments.

   5.   Interaction with SCTP and multihoming.

   6.   Need for the NAT box to act as proxy for correspondent node when
        IPv6 node is mobile, with consequent restrictions on mobility.

   7.   Inability to handle multicast traffic.

Internet-Draft           analysis-64-translation           December 2009


        Discussion: efforts are underway to support translation of
        multicast traffic [I-D.venaas-behave-v4v6mc-framework].

   8.   Scalability concerns together with introduction of a single
        point of failure and a security attack nexus.



        Discussion: There is still a single point of failure for the NAT
        connections.

   9.   Creation of a DoS (Denial of Service) threat relating to
        exhaustion of memory and address/port pool resources on the
        translator.



        Discussion: This can be considered as partially mitigated as DNS
        queries do not result in state creation over NAT.  However a DoS
        can still be mounted by address/port pool resource exhaustion.

   10.  Restricted validity of translated DNS records: a translated
        record may be forwarded to an application that cannot use it.



        Discussion: If a node on the v4 side forwards the address of the
        other endpoint to a node which cannot contact the NAT box or is
        not covered under the endpoint-dependent contraints of NAT, then
        the new node will not be able to initiate contact.

   11.  IPSec



        Discussion: RFC4966 states that " Unless UDP encapsulation is
        used for IPsec [RFC3498], traffic using IPsec AH (Authentication
        Header), in transport and tunnel mode, and IPsec ESP
        (Encapsulating Security Payload), in transport mode, is unable
        to be carried through NAT-PT without terminating the security
        associations on the NAT-PT, due to their usage of cryptographic
        integrity protection.".  This is still true for 64.

2.2.  Problems Addressed by 64

   The problems that the 64 proposal adequately addresses:

Internet-Draft           analysis-64-translation           December 2009


   1.  Constraints on network topology.



       Discussion: This issue has mitigated severity as the DNS is
       separate from the NAT box

   2.  Address selection issues when either the internal or external
       hosts implement both IPv4 and IPv6.



       Discussion: This is totally under the control of DNS.  So the NAT
       is free of any of these considerations.

   3.  Inappropriate translation of responses to A queries from IPv6
       nodes.



       Discussion: Since DNS is not a NAT responsibility anymore, this
       is no more a cause of concern.

   4.  Address selection issues and resource consumption in a DNS-ALG
       with multi-addressed nodes



       Discussion: Since the DNS-ALG is not there and new connection
       initiation is not supported from IPv4 side, their is no need to
       maintain temporary states in anticipation of connections.

   5.  Limitations on DNS security capabilities when using a DNS-ALG.



       Discussion: DNSSEC is now supported, so this issue is resolved.

   6.

2.3.  Problems Addressed by other BEHAVE  documents

   Some issues mentioned in RFC4966 were solved by RFC 4787 [RFC4787],
   RFC 5382 [RFC5382] and RFC 5508 [RFC5508].  At the time when NAT-PT
   was published these recommendations were not in place but they are
   ortoghonal to the translation algorithm per se, therefore they could
   be implemented with NAT-PT.  On the other hand, NAT64 explicitly
   mentions that these recommendations need to be followed and thus



Penno, et al.             Expires June 18, 2010                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           analysis-64-translation           December 2009


   should be seen as a complete specification.

   1.  Requirement for applications to use keepalive mechanisms to
       workaround connectivity issues caused by premature timeout for
       session table and BIB entries.



       Discussion: Since NAT64 follows RFC4787, RFC5382 and RFC5508
       requirements, there is lower bound (which is pretty is high) for
       the lifetime of the sessions.  In NAT-PT this was unknown and
       applications needed to assume the worst case.  For instance, in
       NAT64, the lifetime for a TCP session is 2 hours, so not much
       keep-alive signalling overhead is needed.

   2.  Lack of address mapping persistence: Some applications require
       address retention between sessions.  The user traffic will be
       disrupted if a different mapping is used.  The use of the DNS-
       ALG to create address mappings with limited lifetimes means that
       applications must start using the address shortly after the
       mapping is created, as well as keep it alive once they start
       using it.



       Discussion: Since RFC4787 recommends the use of endpoint
       independent mapping and NAT64 follows such recomendation
       depending on how many other sessions are for the same endpoint,
       it may be the case that in many cases this is solved.  Having
       said that, the same network and port allcoation scheme could be
       used in NAT-PT which would make it a non-issue.


3.  Conclusions

   The above analysis of the solutions provided by the 64 proposal shows
   that the majority of the problems that are not directly related to
   the decoupling of NAT and DNS remain unaddressed.

   This points to several shortcomings of 64 proposal which must be
   addressed if the future network deployments have to move reliably
   towards 64 as a solution to IPv6 - IPv4 connectivity.

   Some of the issues, as pointed out in RFC 4966, have possible
   solutions.  However these solutions will require significant updates
   to the 64 proposal, increasing its complexity.
