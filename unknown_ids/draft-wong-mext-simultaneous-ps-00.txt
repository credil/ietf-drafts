Internet-Draft   Simultaneous Mobility Problem Statement   February 2008


Abstract

   This document provides a problem statement for simultaneous mobility
   in an infrastructure-based mobility environment.  It considers what
   the simultaneous mobility problem is and describes the conditions
   under which it may occur.  It also illustrates the occurrence of the
   simultaneous mobility problem in the context of different mobility
   protocols such as Mobile IPv6.  The simultaneous mobility problem
   defined here is strictly applied to scenarios when the intermediary
   nodes in the core are not mobile.

Internet-Draft   Simultaneous Mobility Problem Statement   February 2008


1.  Introduction

   We consider mobility of end (or terminal) hosts in an infrastructure-
   based network like the global Internet.  Simultaneous mobility is the
   special case when two end hosts are mobile and each moves away from
   one attachment point in the network to another at, or at about, the
   same time (we give a more precise definition in Section 1.1).
   Although it may not be typical (more typical would be the case when
   one of the two hosts moves and the other hosts within the network
   remain stationary during that time), such an event will occur in from
   time to time, and this must be handled properly by mobility
   protocols.  The simultaneous mobility problem, when it occurs,
   results in the loss of a binding update from a Mobile Host because it
   is sent to a previous address of the other Mobile Host that is also
   moving at around the same time.  Without the introduction of
   additional measures to rescue the communications session, this would
   be expected to result in the interruption of the communications
   session.

1.1.  What is simultaneous mobility?

   We begin by defining some terms that we will use to define the
   simultaneous mobility problem.

   Two Mobile Hosts attached to two different points of attachment in
   the network are said to be in a communication session if they are
   actively exchanging data.  A communication session may be in a normal
   state or an interrupted state.  A session is in a normal state when
   data from one Mobile Host is arriving at the right location for the
   other Mobile Host, and vice versa.  It is in an interrupted state
   otherwise.  A handoff is a movement of a Mobile Host from a previous
   attachment point to a new attachment point, such that the old IP
   address does not route to the new attachment point, but a new IP
   address is needed to route there.  The handoff time is the moment in
   time when it changes from being reachable at the previous attachment
   point to being not reachable at the previous attachment point.  Given
   that time is continuous, it is assumed that only one handoff can
   occur at any given moment in time, i.e, that handoff times are
   unique.  Two handoffs are consecutive if neither of the Mobile Hosts
   performs another handoff in between the two handoffs.  Consecutive
   handoffs can be at the same mobile host or between two different
   mobile nodes.

   We assume that binding updates do not contain information about
   future moves of the sending Mobile Host.  While two Mobile Hosts are
   in a communication session, they get information on the location of
   the other Mobile Host only from binding updates.  In other words,
   they do not actively seek the location of the other Mobile Host, but

   only passively accept binding updates.  Binding updates are sent
   directly to the most current known address (known by the sender) of
   the intended recipient Mobile Host.  In general, the latency for
   binding updates to arrive is assumed to be much smaller than the
   average inter-handoff time, therefore, it is extremely unlikely that
   a binding update would be sent and the recipient Mobile Host would
   move twice before the binding update arrives at the previous network
   of the recipient.

   Then, the simultaneous mobility problem occurs when there are two
   Mobile Hosts in a communications session in normal state, and they
   both move such that the binding updates that they send to each other
   are both lost through belated arrival, and such that the
   communications session never returns from interrupted to normal
   state, but is ended.

   For convenience, we also list some of these definitions in Section 2.

1.2.  Likelihood of Simultaneous Mobility

   Analysis in [simultaneous-mob4] shows that the likelihood of the
   simultaneous mobility problem occuring may be non-trivial, depending
   on the handoff latencies involved, and the frequency of handoffs.

2.  Terminology


   Communication session:  Two Mobile Hosts attached to two different
      points of attachment in the network are said to be in a
      communication session if they are actively exchanging data.  NB:
      We do not attempt to define here what "actively exchanging data"
      means.  This may depend on the applications, and may be related to
      a timer set since the last received packet.


   Normal state (of a communication session):  A session is in a normal
      state when data from one Mobile Host is arriving at the right
      location for the other Mobile Host, and vice versa.


   Interrupted state (of a communication session):  A session is in
      interrupted state when it is not in normal state


   Handoff:  A handoff is a movement of a Mobile Host from a previous
      attachment point to a new attachment point, such that the old IP
      address does not route to the new attachment point, but a new IP
      address is needed to route there.  NB: this is sometimes known as
      layer-3 handoff, in contrast to so-called layer-2 handoff


   Handoff Time:  The handoff time of a handoff is the moment in time
      when it changes from being reachable at the previous attachment
      point to not reachable at the previous attachment point.


   Lost Binding Update:  A binding update is lost if it does not arrive
      at its intended destination.  A binding update is "lost through
      belated arrival" if it makes a belated arrival and is consequently
      lost.  NB: a binding update can be lost not necessarily through
      belated arrival, but through other possible causes of lost binding
      updates, r.g., network congestion, node failure, link failure.  A
      binding update that has arrived late may also be retrieved by some
      other agent in the network without getting lost.

   Belated Arrival (of Binding Update):  A binding update is considered
      to make a belated arrival at a network if the destination Mobile
      Host is no longer attached to that network.

   Consecutive Handoff:

      Two handoffs are consecutive (with respect to a pair of mobile
      nodes) if neither of the Mobile Hosts performs another handoff in
      between the two handoffs.

3.  Simultaneous Mobility Scenarios

   In this section, we describe general simultaneous mobility scenarios
   in an infrastructure-based evironment.

   Figure 1 depicts the simultaneous mobility scenario of two mobile
   hosts in an infrastructure based network.  The example core network
   in Figure 1 is comprised of backbone routers, border routers and edge
   routers.  The simultaneous mobility problem arises when Mobile Host 1
   (MH 1) moves from one attachment point in domain 1 to another
   attachment point in domain 2 for example, while at the same (or
   nearly the same) time communicating Mobile Host 2 (MH 2) moves from
   one attachment point to another attachment point.  The binding update
   information that must be passed between Mobile Host 1 and Mobile Host
   2 will not reach the other prior to their movement.

                 Figure 1: Simultaneous Mobility Scenario

   Figure 2 shows the binding updates between two communicating hosts in
   an infrastructure-based environment.  In the figure, Host A moves
   from domain A1 to domain A2 while host B moves from domain B1 to
   Domain B2 giving rise to the simultaneous mobility scenario.  Under
   certain conditions, the mobiles may lose the binding updates from
   each other giving rise to problems encountered by simultaneous
   mobility.

4.  Applicability of simultaneous mobility

   In this section, we describe how general simultaneous mobility arises
   for two different mobility protocols, such as MIPv6 [RFC3775] and
   SIP-based mobility [SIPMM] are used in an infrastructure-based
   environment.  Both the protocols exhibit certain common features,
   such as the ability to send binding updates directly.

4.1.  Simultaneous Mobility in Mobile IPv6

   In this section, we describe how and under what conditions,
   simultaneous mobility affects the smooth operation of Mobile IPv6
   protocol.

   Mobility extensions for Internet Protocol v4 (MIPv4) does not have a
   problem with simultaneous mobility.  By design, non-moving
   Correspondent Hosts are unaware of the mobility of Mobile Hosts.  The
   home agent of the Mobile Host functions as an anchor point for the
   Mobile Host.  No matter where the Mobile Host moves, packets for it
   always go first to its home network for interception and tunneling by
   its home agent.  If it turns out that the Correspondent Host is also
   mobile, it will also have a home agent and packets from the Mobile
   Host will similarly be intercepted and tunneled to the appropriate
   network by its home agent.  Since both home agents are stationary and
   can always be reached through IP routing simultaneous mobility does
   present a problem to MIPv4.

   Mobile IPv6 however suffers from simultaneous mobility problems
   because the binding updates are sent directly to the mobile nodes, as
   part of route optimization.  In addition Care-of-Test Init (CTI) and
   Home-Test Init (HTI) are also sent to the correspondent nodes, as
   part of return routability.  These increase the vulnerability of
   Mobile IPv6 to simultaneous mobiity problems because it increases the
   delay before a binding update is sent and before it finally arrives
   at the other side.  Figure 3 shows an example call flow for
   simultaneous mobility problems when applied to MIPv6.  In this case,
   the return routability procedure for Mobile A is completed before it
   sends the binding update, but the binding update is lost.  It may
   also be the case that both sides are unable to complete return
   routability because of simultaneous mobility.

4.2.  Simultaneous mobility in SIP-based mobility

   In this section we illustrate how simultaneous mobility problem also
   affects the SIP.  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a protocol
   that enables setting up voice calls, two-way multimedia sessions,
   teleconferencing, instant messaging and other types of communication

   using the Internet.  SIP is a protocol in the Application Layer of
   the OSI Reference Model to enable the establishment, management and
   termination of such real-time communications sessions over an
   Internet Protocol (IP) network.  SIP is defined by RFC 3261 of the
   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  SIP negotiates the features
   and capabilities of a communication session at establishment of the
   session reducing time necessary for setting up communication
   sessions.  Mobility of the end host is handled very naturally by SIP
   using existing SIP signaling mechanisms.  For example, to initiate a
   session, the SIP INVITE message is sent by the initiating device to
   the other device.  The extension of SIP to handle mid-session
   mobility specifies that when one of the two devices moves, it sends a
   re-INVITE message to the other device, informing it of its new
   location (e.g., its new IP address).  In addition to the re-INVITE
   message sent directly to the device that moved (Mobile Host) to the
   other device (Correspondent Host), the Mobile Host also registers its
   presence in the new network with a SIP server in its home network.
   This allows other potential Correspondent Hosts to find the Mobile
   Host.

   Figure 4 is depicts the flow of data resulting from a mishandling of
   simultaneous mobility in SIP.  In the basic SIP mobility scheme, when
   a Mobile Host moves to a new network, it sends a re-INVITE message to
   the Correspondent Host, as well as a REGISTER message to its home
   network SIP server.  There are two options for the part of the re-
   INVITE, i.e., it could go through the inbound proxy of the
   Correspondent Host, or it could go directly to the Correspondent
   Host.  This second option will not work properly if there is
   simultaneous mobility of the Mobile Host and the Correspondent Host.
   Clearly, if the Correspondent Host moves at the same time, the re-
   INVITE may be lost (and similarly, the re-INVITE from the
   Correspondent Host to the Mobile Host could also be lost).  As the
   home SIP severs for both are stationary and always reachable through
   IP routing, the registrations are not affected by simultaneous
   mobility.  It would appear the both hosts could now obtain the new
   location of the other party through the SIP servers, analogous to how
   the home agent provides such information in MIP.  However, in MIP,
   the home agent quickly discovers that the Correspondent Host needs
   the updated binding information, because data packets from the
   Correspondent Host are routed to the home network and intercepted by
   the home agent.

   In the SIP case, on the other hand, the Correspondent Host may not
   immediately contact the SIP sever.  Instead the re-INVITE may time-
   out and may be tried again several more times to the wrong network by
   virtue of its built-in retransmission mechanism.  The crucial
   difference is that the data path and signaling path are separate in
   the case of SIP, unlike that of MIP.  For simplicity, automatic

   retransmissions of lost re-INVITE messages are not shown and neither
   are messages like ACK that acknowledge the SIP OK.  Simultaneous
   mobility of two end-hosts is not usually an issue for pre-session
   mobility in SIP.  However, during a transition before a SIP session
   set-up is complete, simultaneous mobility may present problems.  As
   shown in FIG. 4, it may so happen that one of the signaling messages
   (INVITE, OK, ACK) does not reach the other party and gets lost,
   despite the SIP server keeping an up-to-date registration for both
   parties.

5.  Occurrence of Simultaneous Mobility Problems

   In this section, we consider when the simultaneous mobility problem
   may or may not occur, and we state some of the results of the
   analysis in [simultaneous-mob2].  In these results, the term
   "location proxy" shall be used (applied to a Mobile Host) in a broad
   sense, to meana network function that is used to locate the Mobile
   Host.  Different categories of location proxies are described in
   [simultaneous-mob2], but the categorization is not needed in this
   present draft.

   In an infrastructure-based environment, given a pair of consecutive
   handoffs, one for each of two mobile nodes in a communications
   session in normal state (up till the first handoff), in the absence
   of location proxies for either mobile node (or there might be
   location proxies but they are not used/involved), any binding update
   sent by the earlier moving mobile node will be lost through belated
   arrival, if and only if the binding update does not arrive at the
   other mobile node before it moves.

   Given a pair of consecutive handoffs, one for each of two mobile
   nodes in a communications session in normal state (up till the first
   handoff), in the absence of location proxies for either mobile node
   (or there might be location proxies but they are not used/involved),
   if the binding update from the node that moved first is lost through
   belated arrival, the binding update from the node that moved second
   will also be lost through belated arrival.

   Given a pair of consecutive handoffs, one for each of two mobile
   nodes in a communications session in normal state (up till the first
   handoff), in the absence of location proxies for either mobile node
   (or there might be location proxies but they are not used/involved),
   the simultaneous mobility problem does not occur if and only if the
   binding update from the node that moved earlier reaches the other
   node before that node moves.

   Simultaneous mobility problem does not occur in MIP if it does not
   use Route Optimization.  No binding updates are sent directly to
   mobile nodes.  So, there are none to be lost through belated
   arrivals.  Instead, Home Agents serve as up-to-date intercepting
   location proxies that forward data to the right location as soon as
   Mobile IP registration occurs after each handoff.
