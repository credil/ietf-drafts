            The Sieve scripting language can be used to implement whitelisting,
            blacklisting, personal distribution lists, and other sorts of list matching.
            Currently, this requires
            that all members of such lists be hardcoded in the script itself.
            Whenever a member of a list is added or deleted, the script needs
            to be updated and possibly uploaded to a mail server.

          <t>
            This document defines a Sieve extension for accessing externally stored
            lists -- lists whose members are stored externally to the script, such as
            using LDAP (RFC 4510), ACAP (RFC 2244), or relational databases.

                it might be good to add a registry of well-defined strings that can be used
                instead of URIs, and define the initial string "ab" to represent the user's

            This document specifies an extension to the Sieve language <xref target="RFC5228"/>
            for checking membership in an external list 
            or for redirecting messages to an external list of recipients.
            An "external list" is a list whose members are stored externally to the Sieve script,
            such as using LDAP <xref target="RFC4510"/>, ACAP <xref target="RFC2244"/>,
            or relational databases.
          </t>
          <t>
            This extension adds a new match type to apply to supported tests,
            and a new tagged argument to the "redirect" action.
          </t>
          
          <section title="Conventions used in this document">
            <t>

          <section anchor="capability" title="Capability Identifier">
            <t>
              The capability string associated with the extension defined in this
              document is "extlists".
            </t>
          </section>

          <section title=':list match type for supported tests'>
            <t>ABNF:
              <list style="hanging" hangIndent="8">
                <t hangText="   MATCH-TYPE">=/ ":list"
                  <vspace />; only valid for supported tests
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>
              The new ":list" match type changes the interpretation
              of the "key-list" parameter (the second parameter) to
              supported tests.
              When the match type is ":list", the key-list becomes a list of names of externally
              stored lists. The external lists are queried, perhaps through a list-specific
              mechanism, and the test evaluates to "true" if any of the specified values
              matches any member of one or more of the lists.
            </t>
            <t>
              Comparators are not allowed together with the ":list" match type,
              so if both are specified in a test, that MUST result in an error.
            </t>
            <t>
              Implementations MUST support "address", "envelope" and "header" tests.
              Implementations that include the Variables extension <xref target="RFC5229" />
              MUST also support "string" tests.
            </t>
            <t>
              Implementations MAY support other tests but MUST raise an error
              (which SHOULD be a compile-time error, but MAY be a runtime error)
              when a script uses :list with a test for which it is not supported.
              To maintain interoperability, other tests that can be used with :list
              SHOULD be documented in a
              specification that defines a capability string that can be tested (in a
              "require" statement, or using ihave <xref target="RFC5463" />).
            </t>
            <t>
              For example, testing 'header ["to", "cc"]' against a list would cause each
              "to" and "cc" value, ignoring leading and trailing whitespace, to be queried.
              If any value is found to belong to the list, the test returns "true".
              If no value belongs to the list, the test returns "false".
              Once a value is found in the list, there is no need for the query
              mechanism to look further.
            </t>              
            <t>
              For some lists, the Sieve engine might directly retrieve the list and make its
              own comparison.  Other lists might not work that way -- they might provide a way
              to ask if a value is in the list, but not permit retrieval of the list itself.
              It is up to the Sieve implementation to understand how to interact with any
              supported list.  If the Sieve engine is permanently unable to query the list
              (perhaps because the list doesn't support the required operation), the test
              MUST result in a runtime error in the Sieve script.

Ned: There's one addition I'd like to make to the list. I've proposed saying
that if variables are enabled ${0} should return the thing that matched
in a :list match, just like it does for :matches. ${1} and so on would
return optional, list-specific information. In the case of pab: URLs
I'd suggest defining ${1} to be a sort of status for the entry returned.
</cref>
<vspace blankLines="1" />
<cref>
Alexey: Can you elaborate on what you mean by "status" here and how would this
work for other types of URIs?

              The "redirect" action with the ":list" argument is used to send
              the message to one or more email addresses stored in the externally stored
              list 'ext-list-name'. This variant of the redirect command can be used
              to implement a personal distribution list.
            </t>
            <t>
              For this feature to work, one of the following conditions has to be true:
              <list style="numbers">
                <t>
                  The list resolves to a list of email addresses, and the Sieve
                  engine is able to enumerate those addresses.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The list handler is able to take care of the redirection on
                  behalf of the Sieve engine.
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>

            <t>
              In cases where, for example, a list contains hashed email address values or
              an email address pattern ("sz*@example.com", "*+ietf@example.net"),
              the Sieve engine will not be able to redirect to that list, and responsibility
              must pass to the list handler.
            </t>
            <t>
              If neither the Sieve engine nor the list handler
              can enumerate (or iterate) the list, or the list
              does not resolve to email addresses, the situation
              MUST result in a runtime error in the Sieve script.

              The uses for external lists specified here represent the useful
              cases and situations at the time of this writing.
              Other uses for external lists, using other Sieve features,
              might be devised in the future, and such uses can be
              described in extensions to this document.

            <t>
              A name of an externally stored list is always an absolute URI <xref target="RFC3986"/>.
              Implementations might find URIs such as LDAP <xref target="RFC4510"/>,
              CardDAV <xref target="I-D.ietf-vcarddav-carddav"/>,
              or Tag <xref target="RFC4151"/> to be useful for naming external lists.
            </t>

            <t>
<cref>This might have to change with the introduction of "ab:" URIs</cref><vspace/>
              The "tag" URI scheme <xref target="RFC4151"/> MUST be supported, and
              can be used to represent opaque,
              but user friendlier identifiers. Resolution of such identifiers is going
              to be implementation specific and it can help in hiding the complexity of
              an implementation from end users. For example, an implementation can
              provide a web interface for managing lists of users stored in LDAP.
              Requiring users to know generic LDAP URI syntax might not be very
              practical, due to its complexity. An implementation can instead use
              a fixed tag URI prefix such as "tag:example.com,&lt;date&gt;:" (where &lt;date&gt;
              can be, for example, a date generated once on installation of the web interface and
              left untouched upon upgrades)
              and the prefix doesn't even need to be shown to end users.

              The "valid_ext_list" test is true if all of the external list names

        <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
          <t>
            Security considerations related to the "address"/"envelope"/"header" tests and
            "redirect" action discussed in Sieve <xref target="RFC5228"/> also apply
            to this document.
          </t>

          <t>
            External list memberships ought to be treated as if they are
            an integral part of the script,
            so a temporary failure to access an external list
            SHOULD be handled in the same way as a temporary failure to retrieve
            the Sieve script itself.
          </t>

          <t>
            For example, if the Sieve script is stored in the 
            Lightweight Directory Access Protocol <xref target="RFC4510"/> and the script
            can't be retrieved when a message is processed (perhaps the LDAP server is
            unavailable), then the Sieve engine
            might delay message delivery until the script can be retrieved successfully.
            Similarly, if an external list is stored in LDAP and that LDAP server is
            unavailable, the Sieve engine would take the same action -- delay message delivery
            and try again later.
          </t>

          <t>
            Protocols/APIs used to retrieve/verify external list membership MUST provide
            an appropriate level of confidentiality and authentication.
            Usually, that will be at least the same level of confidentiality as
            protocols/APIs used to retrieve Sieve scripts, but only the implementation
            (or deployment) will know what is appropriate.
            There's a difference, for example, between making an LDAP
            request on a closed LAN that's only used for trusted servers
            (it may be that neither encryption nor authentication is needed),
            on a firewalled LAN internal to a company
            (it might be OK to skip encryption, depending upon policy),
            and on the open Internet
            (encryption and authentication are probably both required).
            It also matters whether the list being accessed is private or public
            (no encryption or authentication may be needed for public data, even on the
            Internet).
          </t>
            
          <t>
            Implementations of this extension should keep in mind that
            matching values against an externally stored list can be IO
            and/or CPU intensive. This can be used to deny service to the mailserver
            and/or to servers providing access to externally stored mailing lists.
            A na&iuml;ve implementation, such as the one that tries to retrieve content
            of the whole list to perform matching can make this worse.
          </t>
            
          <t>
            But note that many protocols that can be used for accessing externally
            stored lists support flexible searching features that can be used
            to minimize network traffic and load on the directory service.
            For example, LDAP allows for search filters.
            Implementations SHOULD use such features whenever they can.
          </t>

          <t>
            Many organizations support external lists with thousands of recipients.
            In order to avoid mailbombs when redirecting a message to
            an externally stored list, implementations SHOULD enforce
            limits on the number of recipients and/or on domains to which such
            recipients belong.

          <section title="Registration of a new URI scheme">
            <t>
              The following requests IANA to register a new URI scheme according
              to the IANA registration template specified in <xref target="RFC4395"/>:
            </t>
              
            <t>
              URI scheme name:  ab

              Status:  Permanent
              <vspace/>
              URI scheme syntax:<vspace/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;paburi = "ab:" addrbook [ "?" extensions ]<vspace/>

              <vspace/>
              URI scheme semantics: "ab" URIs are used for designating references
              to personal address books. A personal address book is an internal
              concept used by different applications (such as Sieve interpreters)
              for describing a list of named entries, and maybe translated into
              other types of address books, such as LDAP Groups.

              <vspace/>
              Encoding considerations:  Percent-encoding is allowed in "segment"
              and "query" components.  Internationalization is handled by IRI
              processing.

              <vspace/>
              Intended usage:  An "ab" URI is designed to be used internally by
                 applications for referencing address books.

              <vspace/>
              Applications and/or protocols that use this URI scheme name:
                 Currently only Sieve External List extension is using this URI scheme.
                 Email clients that use URIs internally might find this URI scheme
                 to be useful as well.

              <vspace/>
              Interoperability considerations:  Applications are only REQUIRED to support "ab:default".

              <vspace/>
              Security considerations:  Applications SHOULD ensure appropriate
                 restrictions are in place to protect sensitive information that
                 might be revealed by "ab" URIs from access or modification by
                 untrusted sources.
