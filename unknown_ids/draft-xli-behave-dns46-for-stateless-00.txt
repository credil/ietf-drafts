Internet-Draft       DNS46 for Stateless Translator         October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The IPv4/IPv6 translation framework document
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework] presents the 8 scenarios and
   introduces the stateless and stateful operation modes of the IPv4/
   IPv6 translators.  The stateless translator can support the following
   scenarios.

   o  Scenario 1: An IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet.

   o  Scenario 2: The IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network.

   o  Scenario 5: An IPv6 network to an IPv4 network.

   o  Scenario 6: An IPv4 network to an IPv6 network.

   The stateful translator can support the following scenarios.

   o  Scenario 1: An IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet.

   o  Scenario 3: The IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 network.

   o  Scenario 5: An IPv6 network to an IPv4 network.

   DNS mechanism is one of the functions model for the IPv6/IPv4
   transition [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework].  In general, there are
   the DNS64 for providing the name/address resolving from IPv4 to IPv6
   and the DNS46 for providing the name/address resolving from IPv6 to
   IPv4.  In addition, if the destination is "an IPvX network", it is
   the authoritative DNS server with IPvX and IPvY entries in the zone
   file, while if the destination is "the IPvY Internet", it performs
   the function for synthesizing the IPvX records from the IPvY records
   [RFC1035].

   The DNS64 should support:

   o  Scenario 1: An IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet (synthesizing).

   o  Scenario 3: The IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 network (authoritative).

   o  Scenario 5: An IPv6 network to an IPv4 network (authoritative).

   The DNS46 should support:

   o  Scenario 2: The IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network (authoritative).

   o  Scenario 6: An IPv4 network to an IPv6 network (authoritative).

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.   DNS function for the IPv4/IPv6 Stateless Translator

   The stateless translator can support IPv6-initiated communications as
   well as the IPv4 initiated communications for the IPv6 hosts using
   IPv4-translatable addresses, which requires the DNS64 function, as
   well as the DNS46 function [I-D.xli-behave-ivi].

   o  Scenario 1: An IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet (DNS64,
      synthesizing).

   o  Scenario 2: The IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network (DNS46,
      authoritative).

   o  Scenario 5: An IPv6 network to an IPv4 network (DNS64,
      authoritative).

   o  Scenario 6: An IPv4 network to an IPv6 network (DNS46,
      authoritative).

3.1.  DNS64 function for the IPv4/IPv6 Stateless Translator

   The DNS64 function is for Scenarios 1 and Scenario 3, which are also
   used for the stateful translators.  The DNS64 function is defined in
   DNS64 document [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64].

3.2.  DNS46 function for the IPv4/IPv6 Stateless Translator

   This document defines the DNS46 function and it is the authoritative
   DNS server with A and AAAA entries in the zone file.

3.2.1.  Fix AAAA record

   This is very similar to the authoritative DNS configuration of the
   dual-stack hosts.  The only difference is that in the dual-stack
   case, the A record and AAAA record are independent, while in
   stateless translation case, the hosts are IPv6 single stack using
   IPv4-translatable addresses and the A record can be derived from the
   AAAA record based on the algorithm and the PREFIX information
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].

3.2.2.  Varying AAAA record

   If IPv6 host has a varying AAAA record (that is, it could change due
   to the IPv6-only host changing its IPv6 address and registering its
   new address via, for example, Dynamic DNS), then the dynamic DNS46
   function is required.  However, it is still the authoritative DNS.
   The A record can be derived from the AAAA record based on the
   algorithm and the PREFIX information
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].


4.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations in this document.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo adds no new IANA considerations.

   Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
   correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are
   required, or if those assignments or registries are created during
   the RFC publication process.  From the author's perspective, it may
   therefore be removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor's
   discretion.
