    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

      <t>The architecture of some networks results in more than one operator being involved in
         providing Internet connectivity to an end-point. Examples of this type of configuration are prevalent in residential broadband access environments
         where the physical infrastructure is owned by one operator, while a third-party ISP provides an IP address and layer 3 connectivity to the Internet.
         In architectures such as these, the Internet connectivity service is dependent on both providers. Similarly, both have information 
         about the connectivity of an end-point to the network. The information that one party holds, however, is usually different to the information held 
         by the other party, and neither party (on its own) can use the information it possesses to yield
         the physical location of an end-point. However, when the connectivity information held by the two parties is combined the location of the end-point
         can be determined.

    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key conventions and terminology used in this document are defined as follows:
      </t>

      <t>This document reuses the terms Target, as defined in <xref target="RFC3693"/>.
      </t>
      <t> This document uses the term Location Information Server (LIS) as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps"/>.
      </t>
      <t>Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS). A node in a DSL network responsible for switching data streams between end-points and Internet Service Providers.
      </t>
      

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
         document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Overview">

      <t>The Geopriv L7 LCP requirements <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps"/> describe a range of network topologies in which a Target should be able to acquire its
         location from a LIS using an application layer location acquisition protocol. The scope of <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps"/> is such that it does not address 
         specific network topologies that may exist inside the access network provider domain. This document provides scope and requirements for LIS to LIS communications where the two
         servers are controlled by different operators each running a part of the access network. While the same principles may be applied to inter-LIS communication occurring
         between a LIS in the customer premise network and the access provider network, operation in this configuration is not considered in scope for this document.

      <t><xref target="fig1"/> illustrates a typical multi-operator access network where physical and switched
        connectivity is provided by a Regional Access Network Provider, and higher layer routing functions are
        provided by an Internet Service provider (ISP). It is the ISP that owns the relationship with the broadband customer, the end-point, and it is the ISP LIS
        that will be contacted by any end-point to provide location. The ISP will know network parameters such as the IP address allocated to the end-point,
        and the associated NAS and port the incoming connection is terminated on; but it often will not know any information
        pertaining to connectivity (physical or logical) inside the regional access network. Conversely in many situations the regional access
        provider will not have access to information such as the IP address of the end-point or a means to correlate the IP address with other known
        physical parameters. The regional access provider will have access to information from the switch core, the access node, and cable termination records, 
        allowing the regional access provider LIS to determine a physical location. Common information between the ISP NAS and the Regional Access Provider's switching core, 
        such as circuit identifiers, are required in order to ensure correct data transmission through the network, and these can be used as Target identifiers
        from the ISP LIS to the Regional Access LIS allowing the physical location of an end-point to be retrieved.

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
  <t>LIS to LIS communications are necessary in some network architectures and care must be taken to ensure that they are
    secure both from a privacy perspective and from an integrity perspective. This can be achieved in the most part with
    existing protocol suites, such as TLS, using certificates or pre-shared keys. Another factor that must be protected against
    is the ability of a legitimate ISP LIS asking for the location of an end-point associated with a different ISP. Operators of
    regional access servers will need to ensure that this operational requirement is met.
