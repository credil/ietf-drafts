Abstract 

   Continuity Check (CC), Proactive Connectivity Verification (CV) and 
   Remote Defect Indication (RDI) functionalities required for are MPLS-
   TP OAM.  
    
   Continuity Check monitors the integrity of the continuity of the path 
   for any loss of continuity defect. Connectivity verification monitors 
   the integrity of the routing of the path between sink and source for 
   any connectivity issues. RDI enables an End Point to report, to its 
   associated End Point, a fault or defect condition that it detects on 
   a PW, LSP or Section. 
    
   This document specifies methods for proactive CV, CC, and RDI for 
   MPLS-TP Label Switched Path (LSP), PWs and Sections using 
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD).

1. Introduction 

   In traditional transport networks, circuits are provisioned on two or 
   more switches. Service Providers (SP) need OAM tools to detect mis-
   connectivity and loss of continuity of transport circuits. Both PWs 
   and MPLS-TP LSPs [7] emulating traditional transport circuits need to 
   provide the same CC and proactive CV capabilities as required in 
   draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements[3]. This document describes the 
   use of BFD for CC, proactive CV, and RDI of a PW, LSP or PST between 
   two Maintenance Entity Group End Points (MEPs). 

   As described in [9], Continuity Check (CC) and Proactive Connectivity 
   Verification (CV) functions are used to detect loss of continuity 
   (LOC), and unintended connectivity between two MEPs (e.g. mismerging 
   or misconnection or unexpected MEP).  

   The Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is an indicator that is 
   transmitted by a MEP to communicate to its peer MEP that a signal 
   fail condition exists. RDI is only used for bidirectional connections 
   and is associated with proactive CC & CV packet generation. 

   This document specifies the BFD extension and behavior to satisfy the 
   CC, proactive CV monitoring and the RDI functional requirements for 
   bi-directional paths. Procedures for uni-directional paths are for 
   further study. 

   The mechanisms specified in this document are restricted to BFD 
   asynchronous mode.

3. MPLS CC, proactive CV and RDI Mechanism using BFD 

   This document proposes distinct encapsulations and code points for 
   BFD depending on whether the mode of operation is CC or CV:  

  o  CC mode: defines a new code point in the Associated Channel Header 
     (ACH) described in [2].In this mode Continuity Check and RDI 
     functionalities are supported. 

  o  CV mode: defines a new code point in the Associated Channel Header 
     (ACH) described in [2]. Under MPLS label stack, the ACH with "MPLS 
     Proactive CV" code point indicates that the message is an MPLS BFD 
     proactive CV and CC message. 

  o  RDI: is communicated via the BFD state field in BFD CC and CV 
     messages. It is not a distinct PDU.

   The first nibble (0001b) indicates the ACH. 

   The version and the flags are set to 0 as specified in [2]. 

   The code point is either 

   - BFD CC code point = 0xHH. [HH to be assigned by IANA from the PW 
   Associated Channel Type registry.] or, 

   - BFD proactive CV code point = 0xHH. [HH to be assigned by IANA from 
   the PW Associated Channel Type registry.] 

   Both CC and CV modes apply to PWs, MPLS LSPs (including tandem 
   connection monitoring), and Sections. 

   It's possible to run BFD in CC mode on some transport paths and BFD 
   in CV mode on other transport paths. For a given Maintenance Entity 
   Group (MEG) only one mode can be used.  A MEP that is configured to

   consider them as an unexpected packet, i.e. detect a mis-connectivity 
   defect.

   defined in Section 3 of RFC 5586 and one ACH TLV object carrying the 
   unique MEP Identifier of the source of the BFD packet defined in [8]. 

   When GAL label is used, the TTL field of the GAL MUST be set to at 
   least 1, and the GAL will be the end of stack label (S=1). 

3.4. BFD Session in MPLS-TP terminology 

   A BFD session corresponds to a CC or a proactive CV OAM instance in 
   MPLS-TP terminology. 

   A BFD session is enabled when the CC or proactive CV functionality is 
   enabled on a configured Maintenance Entity (ME) or in the case of an 
   associated bi-directional path, pair of Maintenance Entities.  

   On a Sink MEP, a BFD session can be in DOWN, INIT or UP state as 
   detailed in [4]. 

   When on a ME the CC or proactive CV functionality is disabled, the 
   BFD session transitions to the ADMIN DOWN State and the BFD session 
   ends. 

   A new BFD session is initiated when the operator enables or re-
   enables the CC or CV functionality on the same ME. 

3.5. BFD Profile for MPLS-TP 

   BFD MUST operate in asynchronous mode. In this mode, the BFD Control 
   packets are periodically sent at configurable time rate. This rate is 
   typically a fixed value for the lifetime of the session. In the rare 
   circumstance where an operator has a reason to change session 
   parameters, poll/final discipline is used. 

   The transport profile is designed to operate independent of the 
   control plane; hence the C bit SHOULD be set. 

   This document specifies bi-directional BFD for p2p transport paths, 
   hence the M bit MUST be clear. 

   There are two modes of operation for bi-directional paths. One in 
   which the session state of both directions of the path is coordinated 
   and one constructed from BFD sessions in such a way that the two 
   directions operate independently. A single bi-directional BFD session 
   is used for coordinated operation. Two independent BFD sessions are 
   used for independent operation.  

   Coordinated operation is as described in [4]. Independent operation 
   requires clarification of two aspects of [4]. Independent operation

   is characterized by the setting of MinRxInterval to zero by the MEP 
   that is typically the session originator (referred to as the source 
   MEP), and there will be a session originator at either end of the bi-
   directional path. Each source MEP will have a corresponding sink MEP 
   that has been configured to a Tx interval of zero.  

   The base spec is unclear on aspects of how a MEP with a BFD transmit 
   rate set to zero behaves. One interpretation is that no periodic 
   messages originate with that MEP, it will only originate messages on 
   a state change.  

   The first clarification is that when a state change occurs a MEP set 
   to a transmit rate of zero sends BFD control messages with a one 
   second period until such time that the state change is confirmed by 
   the session peer. At this point the MEP set to a transmit rate of 
   zero can resume quiescent behavior. This adds robustness to all state 
   transitions in the RxInterval=0 case. 

   The second is that the originating MEP (the one with a non-zero 
   TxInterval) will ignore a DOWN state received from a zero interval 
   peer. This means that the zero interval peer will continue to send 
   DOWN state messages as the state change is never confirmed. This adds 
   robustness to the exchange of RDI indication on a uni-directional 
   failure (for both session types DOWN with a diagnostic of control 
   detection period expired offering RDI functionality).  

   A further extension to the base specification is that there are 
   additional OAM protocol exchanges that act as inputs to the BFD state 
   machine; these are the Link Down Indication [6] and the Lock 
   Instruct/Lock Report transactions. 

3.5.1. Session initiation 

   In all scenarios a BFD session starts with both ends in the DOWN 
   state. DOWN state messages exchanged include the desired Tx and Rx 
   rates for the session. If a node cannot support the Min Tx rate 
   desired by a peer MEP it does not transition from down to the INIT 
   state and sends a diagnostic code (TBD) indicating that the requested 
   Tx rate cannot be supported. 

   Otherwise once a transition from DOWN to INIT has occurred, the 
   session progresses as per [4]. 

3.5.2. Defect entry criteria 

   There are further defect criteria beyond that defined in [4] to 
   consider given the possibility of mis-connectivity and mis-
   configuration defects. The result is the criteria for a path 
 
Allan et al.,          Expires January 12, 2011                [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-tp-cc-cv-rdi-01            July 2010 
 

   direction to transition from the defect free state to a defect state 
   is a superset of that in the BFD base specification [4]. 
   The following conditions cause a MEP to enter the defect state for CC 
   of CV: 
     1. BFD session times out (Loss of Continuity defect), 
     2. Receipt of a link down indication. 
     3. Receipt of an unexpected M bit (Session Mis-configuration 
        defect), 
 
   And the following will cause the MEP to enter the defect state for CV 
   operation 
     1. BFD control packets are received with an unexpected 
        encapsulation (Mis-connectivity defect), these include 
          - a PW receiving a packet with a GAL 
          - an LSP receiving an IP header instead of a GAL 
          (note there are other possibilities but these can also alias  
     2. Receipt of an unexpected globally unique Source MEP identifier 
        (Mis-connectivity defect), 
     3. Receipt of an unexpected session discriminator in the your 
        discriminator field (Mis-connectivity defect), 
     4. Receipt of an expected session discriminator with an unexpected 
        label (mis-connectivity defect), 
      
   The effective defect hierarchy (order of checking) is 

     1. Receiving nothing 

     2. Receiving link down indication 

     3. Receiving from an incorrect source (determined by whatever 
        means) 

     4. Receiving from a correct source (as near as can be determined), 
        but with incorrect session information) 

     5. Receiving control packets in all discernable ways correct.

3.5.3. Defect entry consequent action 

   Upon defect entry a sink MEP will assert signal fail into any client 
   (sub-)layers. It will also communicate session DOWN to its session 
   peer. 

   The blocking of traffic as consequent action MUST be driven only by a 
   defect's consequent action as specified in draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-
   framework [9] section 5.1.1.2. 
   When the defect is mis-branching, the transport path termination will 
   silently discard all non-oam traffic received. 

3.5.4. Defect exit criteria 

   Exit from a Loss of continuity defect 

   For a coordinated session, exit from a loss of connectivity defect is 
   as described in figure 4 which updates [4]. 

   For an independent session, exit from a loss of connectivity defect 
   occurs upon receipt of a well formed control packet from the peer MEP 
   as described in figures 5 and 6. 

   Exit from a session mis-configuration defect 

   [editors: for a future version of the document] 

   Exit from a mis-connectivity defect 

   The exit criteria for a mis-connectivity defect is determined by the 
   maximum of the set of min Rx session time times the multiplier that 
   have been received. A session can transition from DOWN to UP 
   (independent mode) or DOWN to INIT (coordinated mode) when both 
   correctly formed control packets are being exchanged, and no mis-
   connected control packets have been received in the specified 
   interval. 

3.5.5. State machines 

   The following state machines update [4]. They have been modified to 
   include LDI and LKI as inputs to the state machine and to clarify the 
   behavior for independent mode. 

   The coordinated session state machine has been augmented to indicate 
   LDI and LKR as inputs to the state machine. For a session that is in 
   the UP state, receipt of LDI or LKR will transition the session into 
   the DOWN state.

   [Dave: I have to think that we do not need to consider LDI/LKR for 
   transition from DOWN to INIT, I have to receive a BFD control packet 
   to do that which means the condition is cleared, only funky case is 
   when I'm getting both UP messages and LDI/LKR]

       Figure 4: State machine for coordinated session operation 
    

   For independent mode, there are two state machines. One for the 
   source MEP (who requested MinRxInterval=0) and the sink MEP (who 
   agreed to MinRxInterval=0). 

   The source MEP will not transition out of the UP state once 
   initialized except in the case of a forced ADMIN DOWN. Hence LDI/LKR 
   do not enter into the state machine transition from the UP state, but 
   do enter into the INIT and DOWN states.

   The sink MEP state machine (for which the transmit interval has been 
   set to zero) is modified to: 
    
   1) Permit direct transition from DOWN to UP once the session has been 
   initialized. With the exception of via the ADMIN DOWN state, the 
   source MEP will never transition from the UP state, hence in normal 
   unidirectional fault scenarios will never transition to the INIT 
   state.

3.5.6. Configuration of MPLS-TP BFD sessions 

   [Editors note, for a future revision of the document] 

3.5.7. Discriminator values 

   In the BFD control packet the discriminator values have either local 
   to the sink MEP or no significance (when not known). 

   My Discriminator field MUST be set to a nonzero value (it can be a 
   fixed value), the transmitted your discriminator value MUST reflect 
   back the received value of My discriminator field or be set to 0 if 
   that value is not known. 

   Although the BFD base specification permits an implementation to 
   change the my discriminator field at arbitrary times, this is not 
   permitted for CV mode in order to avoid race conditions in mis-
   connectivity defects.

5. IANA Considerations 

   To be added in a later version of this document 

6. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations for the authentication TLV need further 
   study. 

   Base BFD foresees an optional authentication section (see [4] 
   section 6.7); that can be extended also to the tool proposed in 
   this document. 

   Authentication methods that require checksum calculation on the 
   outgoing packet must extend the checksum also on the ME 
   Identifier Section. This is possible but seems uncorrelated with 
   the solution proposed in this document: it could be better to 
   use the simple password authentication method.
