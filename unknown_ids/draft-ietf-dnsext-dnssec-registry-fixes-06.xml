<abstract>
	<t>
	The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of
	cryptographic algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over DNS data. There is currently an
    IANA registry for these algorithms that is incomplete in that it lacks the implementation status of 
    each algorithm. This document provides an applicability statement on algorithm status for DNSSEC implementations.
    This document replaces that registry table with a new IANA registry table for Domain 
    Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers which lists each algorithm's status based on the 
    current reference.  If that status is not defined in the original specification, this document assigns a
    status.

<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
	The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC) <xref target="RFC4033" />, <xref target="RFC4034" />,
	and <xref target="RFC4035" /> uses digital signatures over DNS data
	to provide source authentication and integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA registry
	to allocate codes for digital signature algorithms (consisting of a cryptographic
	algorithm and one-way hash function).   
	</t>
	<t>
	The original list of algorithm status is found in <xref target="RFC4034" />.
	Other DNSSEC documents have added new algorithms or changed the status of
	algorithms in the registry.  However, currently implementors
	must read through all the documents in order to discover the current status
	of each algorithm in the registry.  
	</t>
	<t>
    This document replaces the current IANA registry for Domain Name
	System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers with a newly defined registry table.  This new table (Section 2.2 below) 
    contains a column that will list the current status of each digital
	signature algorithm in the registry at the time of writing and assigns status for some algorithms 
	used with DNSSEC that did not have an identified status in their specification.  This 
	document updates the following: <xref target="RFC2536" />, <xref target="RFC2539" />, <xref target="RFC3110" />, 
	<xref target="RFC4034" />, <xref target="RFC4398" />, <xref target="RFC5155" />, <xref target="RFC5702" />, and 
    <xref target="RFC5933" />.
	</t>
<section title="Requirements Language">
    <t>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;,
&quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
&quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;,
&quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.
	</t>
</section>
</section>
<section title="The DNS Security Algorithm Number Subregistry">
	<t>
	The DNS Security Algorithm Number subregistry (part of the Domain Name
	System (DNS) Security Number registry) will be replaced with the table below.
	This table contains a column that contains the current implementation requirements of the given 
	algorithm. 
	</t>
	<t>
        There are additional differences to entries that are described in sub-section 2.1.
	The overall new registry table is in sub-section 2.2.  The values for the status
	were obtained from <xref target="RFC4034" /> with updates for algorithms
	specified after the original DNSSEC specification. If no status was listed in 
	the original specification, this document assigns one.
	</t>
  <section title="Individual Changes">
        <t>
        This document changes three entries in the Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC)
	Algorithm Registry.  They are:
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for assignment number 4 is changed to "Reserved until 2020".
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for assignment number 9 is changed to "Reserved until 2020".
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for assignment number 11 is changed to "Reserved until 2020".</t> 
	<t>Registry entries 13-251 remains Unassigned.</t>
    <t>
        The status of RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 and DSA-NSEC3-SHA1 are set to RECOMMENDED and OPTIONAL
	respectively.  The difference is due to the fact that RSA/SHA-1 is REQUIRED and DSA/SHA-1
	is only OPTIONAL.
        The status of RSA/SHA-256 and RSA/SHA-512 are set to RECOMMENDED as it is believed 
        that these algorithms will replace older algorithms (e.g. RSA/SHA-1) that have a 
	perceived weakness in their hash algorithm (SHA-1).

<section title="Specifying New Algorithms and Updating Status of Existing Entries">
	<t>
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsext-dnssec-alg-allocation" /> establishes a parallel procedure for
	obtaining an algorithm number for new algorithms other than a standards track document.  
	Algorithms entered into the registry using that procedure do not have a listed status.  Specifications
        that follow this path do not need to obsolete or update this document.
    	</t>
	<t>
	Adding a newly specified algorithm to the registry with a status  
	SHALL entail obsoleting this document and replacing the registry table (with the new 
    algorithm entry). Altering the status column value of any existing algorithm in the registry SHALL entail obsoleting 
	this document and replacing the registry table.
	</t>
	<t>
	This document cannot be updated, only made obsolete and replaced by a successor document.
