    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document performs a gap analysis of the current state of BFD
      <xref target="RFC5880"></xref> according to the requirements of 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-karp-design-guide"></xref>.
      Previously, the OPSEC working group has provided an analysis of
      cryptographic issues with BFD in <xref target="RFC6039"></xref>. </t>

      <t> The existing BFD specifications provide a very initial
      security solution. Key ID is provided so that the key used in
      securing a packet can be changed on demand. Two cryptographic algorithms
      (MD5 and SHA-1) are supported for Integrity protection of the control
      packets; the algorithms are both demonstrated to be subject to collision
      attacks. While these attacks will not necessarily affect BFD, other routing protocols
      like RIPv2 <xref target="RFC4822"></xref>, IS-IS <xref target="RFC5310"></xref> 
      and OSPFv2 <xref target="RFC5709"></xref> have moved to stronger algorithms 
     and it is imperative
      that BFD also does that as it does not make much sense to secure these routing protocols
      with a stronger authentication algorithm if BFD continues using a weaker security algorithm. </t>

	 <t>
      While BFD uses a non-decreasing per-packet sequence number to protect itself
      from intra-connection replay attacks, it still leaves the protocol vulnerable to the 
	  inter-session replay attacks. 
	</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements to Meet ">
      <t>There are several requirements described in section 3 of
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-karp-threats-reqs"></xref> that BFD does not
      currently meet: </t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>Replay Protection: BFD provides an incomplete intra-session
           and no inter-session replay attack protection; this creates
          significant denial-of-service opportunities.</t>

          <t>Strong Algorithms: the cryptographic algorithms adopted for
          message authentication in BFD are MD5 or SHA-1 based. However, both
          algorithms known to be vulnerable to collision attacks. <xref
          target="I-D.bhatia-bfd-crypto-auth"></xref> proposes a solution to
          support HMAC with the SHA-1 and SHA-2 family of hash functions for
          BFD. </t>

          <t>DoS Attacks: BFD packets can be sent at millisecond intervals
          (the protocol uses timers at microsecond intervals). When malicious
          packets are sent at short intervals, with the authentication bit
          set, it can cause a DoS attack.</t>

        </list>The remainder of this document explains the details of how
      these requirements fail to be met and proposes mechanisms for addressing
      them. </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Current State ">
      <t><xref target="RFC5880"></xref> describes five authentication
      mechanisms for the integrity protection of BFD control packets: Simple
      Password, Keyed MD5 <xref target="RFC1321"></xref>, Meticulous Keyed
      MD5, Keyed SHA-1 and Meticulous SHA-1. In the simple password mechanism,
      every control packet is associated with a password transported in plain
      text; attacks eavesdropping the network traffic can easily learn the
      password and compromise the security of the corresponding BFD session.
      In the Keyed MD5 and the Meticulous Keyed MD5 mechanisms, BFD nodes use
      share secret keys to generate keyed MD5 digests for control packets.
      Similarly, in the Keyed SHA-1 and the Meticulous Keyed SHA-1 mechanisms,
      BFD nodes use shared secret keys to generate keyed SHA-1 digests for
      control packets. Note that in the keyed authentication mechanisms, every
      BFD control packet is associated with a non-decreasing 32-bit sequence
      number to resist replay attacks. In the Keyed MD5 and the Keyed SHA-1
      mechanisms, the sequence member is only required to increase
      occasionally. However, in the Meticulous Keyed MD5 and the Meticulous
      Keyed SHA-1 mechanisms, the sequence member is required to
      monotonically increase with each succesive packet.</t>

      <t>Additionally, limited key updating functionality is provided. There
      is a Key ID in every authenticated BFD control packet, indicating the
      key used to hash the packet. However, there is no mechanism
     described to provide a smooth key rollover that the BFD routers can use
    when moving from one key to the other. </t>

      <t>It is common to send BFD packets at microsecond and millisecond intervals. Since the
       cryptographic sequence  number space is only 32 bits, it will not take very long
       for the sequence space to reach its maximum value and roll over. 
      This can result in potential inter-session replay attacks. This exacerbates
      when BFD uses the meticulous authentication mode.</t>

      <t>In a BFD session, each nodes needs to select a 32-bit discriminator
      to identify itself. Therefore, a BFD session is identified by two
      discriminators. If a node will randomly select a new discriminator for a
      new session and use authentication mechanism to secure the control
      packets, inter-session replay attacks can be mitigated to some
      extent. However, in existing BFD demultiplexing mechanisms, the
      discriminators used in a new BFD session may be predicable. This issue
      may be taken advantage of by attackers to perform replay attacks.</t>

    <t>  BFD allows a mode called the echo mode.  Echo packets are not
      defined in the BFD specification, though they can keep the BFD
      session up.  The format of the echo packet is local to the sending
     side and there are no guidelines on the properties of these
      packets beyond the choice of the source and destination addresses.
      While the BFD specification recommends applying security
      mechanisms to prevent spoofing of these packets, there are no
      guidelines on what type of mechanisms are appropriate.
	</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Impacts of BFD Replays ">
      <t>As discussed, BFD cannot meet the requirements of inter-session or
      intra-session replay protection. This section discusses the impacts
      of BFD replays. </t>

      <t>When cryptographic authentication mechanisms are adopted for BFD, a
      non-decreasing 32-bit long sequence number is used. In the Keyed MD5 and
      the Keyed SHA-1 mechanisms, the sequence member is not required to
      increase for every packet. Therefore an attacker can keep replaying the
      packets with the latest sequence number until the sequence number is
      updated. This issue is eliminated in the Meticulous Keyed MD5 and the
      Meticulous Keyed SHA-1 mechanisms. However, note that a sequence number
      may reach its maximum and be rolled over in a session. In this case,
      without the support from a automatic key management mechanism, the BFD
      session will be vulnerable to replay attacks performed by sending the
      packets before the roll over of the sequence number. Because the BFD
      specification allows for the change of authentication state based on the
      state of a received packet, an elaborately selected replayed packet can
      cause a serious denial-of-service attack. For instance, an attacker can
      replay a packet in which the sequence number is much larger than the
      current one to convince a node that large amount of packets has been
      lost. As a result, the victim will transfer its state to down. </t>

      <t>BFD does not provide any solution to deal with inter-session
      replay attacks. Although discriminators can potentially be used to
      challenge the aliveness of node on the other side of new BFD session,
      The method of demultiplexing the initial packets is not specified. If
      two subsequent BFD sessions adopt an identical discriminator pair and
      use same cryptographic key to secure the control packets, a malicious
      authenticated packet (stored from the past session) can be used to
      perform inter-connection replay attacks.</t>

      <t> Any security issues in the BFD echo mode will directly affect the BFD
      protocol and session states, and hence the network stability.  
      For instance, any replay attacks would be
      indistinguishable from normal forwarding of the tested router.  An
      attack would still cause a faulty link to be believed to be up,
      but there is little that can be done about it.  However, if the
      echo packets are guessable, it may be possible to spoof from an
      external source and cause BFD to believe that a one-way link is
      really bidirectional.  As a result, it is important that the echo
      packets contain random material that is also checked upon
      reception.
