Internet-Draft          URN Namespace for the OGF               May 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Open Grid Forum (OGF) is a standardisation development
   organisation in the field of distributed computing.  The OGF produces
   documents such as working drafts, specifications, and schemata.  For
   more information, see http://www.ogf.org/

   Working groups in the OGF community have expressed the need for
   global, distributed, persistent identifiers in working drafts and
   standards.  Motivated by this need, the OGF would like to assign URNs
   to some resources in order to retain unique, permanent, location-
   independent names for them.

   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  URN Specification for "ogf" NID

2.1.  Namespace ID

   "ogf" requested.

2.2.  Registration Information

   Registration Version Number: 1
   Registration Date: yyyy-mm-dd [[RFC-Editor: Please replace with the
   date of approval of this document for publication as an RFC]]

2.3.  Declared registrant of the namespace

   Technical Director
   Open Grid Forum
   P.O. Box 2326
   Joliet, Illinois 60434
   USA
   http://www.ogf.org/
   Email: urn@ogf.org

   The position of technical director is currently fulfilled by Joel
   Replogle.

2.4.  Declaration of syntactic structure

   The formal syntax definitions below are given in ABNF [RFC5234].

   The NSS in the urn:ogf names hierarchy begins with a subnamespace
   identifier (SNID), followed by a delimiter and a subnamespace-
   dependent string

      OGF-URN  =  "urn:ogf:" SNID ":" SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING

   where SNID is a unique subnamespace identifier for the specification,
   and SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING is a unique identifier within the
   subnamespace identifier scope.

   SNID has the same syntax as a <NID> as defined in [RFC2141]:

      SNID  =  ( ALPHA / DIGIT )  *31( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" )

   ALPHA and DIGIT are defined in Appendix B of [RFC5234].

   The Technical Director at OGF (or their successor) assigns
   subnamespace identifiers.

   The syntax of SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING is dependent on the SNID,
   and MUST be defined by a Grid Forum Document [GFD-SERIES].  This
   document does not pose any additional restrictions to the
   SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING other than what is defined in the NSS
   syntax as defined by [RFC2141] or its successor:

      SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*<URN chars>

   <URN chars> is defined in Section 2.2 of [RFC2141].

2.5.  Relevant ancillary documentation

   The Technical Director at OGF (or it successor) will keep a list of
   assigned subnamespace identifiers and associated documentation at
   http://www.ogf.org/urn/ [URN-OGF].

   Information on the procedures how to register an subnamespace
   identifier can also be found at this website.

2.6.  Identifier uniqueness considerations

   Identifier uniqueness will be enforced by the Technical Director of
   the Open Grid Forum.

2.7.  Identifier persistence considerations

   The Technical Director will only assign subnamespace identifiers for
   persistent resources.

2.8.  Process of identifier assignment

   Assignment of subnamespace identifiers is limited to the OGF and
   those authorities that are specifically designated by the OGF
   Technical Director.  OGF may assign portions of its namespace
   (specifically, those under designated subnamespace identifiers) for
   assignment by third parties.

   The details of this process will be specified at the OGF website
   [URN-OGF].

   The syntax and semantics of each SNID MUST be defined by a Grid Forum
   Document [GFD-SERIES] before it is assigned.

2.9.  Process of identifier resolution

   OGF will maintain an index of all subnamespace identifiers on its Web
   site, http://www.ogf.org/urn/.

   Resolution mechanism of SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING within each SNID
   MUST be defined before assignment of a subnamespace identifier.

2.10.  Rules for Lexical Equivalence

   The SNID part of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is case insensitive.
   Thus, the SNID MUST be case normalised before comparison.

   The rules for lexical equivalence of the SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING
   part of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is specific for each SNID and MUST
   be defined when a SNID is assigned by the OGF Technical Director.
   These definitions MUST included information about case sensitivity,
   and in case %-escaped octets, MUST define the exact normalisation to
   use (e.g. interpret as octet, interpret as UTF-8, specify type of
   Unicode normalisation factor, etc.)

2.11.  Conformance with URN Syntax

   At the moment of writing, a revision of RFC2141 is proposed, which
   may allow a different set of allowed characters (URN-char) in the NSS
   than the current URN chars (adding "&" and/or "~", whilst removing
   the reserved characters "%", "/", "?" and "#").  The intention of
   this document is to only restrict the syntax of the SNID, and have
   Grid Forum Documents specify the syntax of the SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-

   STRING.  If RFC 2141 is to be updated, this document may be revised
   as well.

   In other words, the current definition:

      SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*<URN chars>

   is likely to change in the future to:

      SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*<URN-char>

   It is RECOMMENDED that assigned OGF URNs only characters acceptable
   by both RFC2141 and the expected revision.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   software implementation accepting OGF URNs allow characters
   acceptable by either RFC2141 or the expected revision.

2.12.  Validation mechanism

   The validation mechanism of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is specific for
   each SNID and MUST be defined when a SNID is assigned by the OGF
   Technical Director.

   URNs in the OGF hierarchy without an assigned SNID are considered to
   be invalid.

2.13.  Scope

   Global URNs, relevant for the distributed computing community in
   general, and the Open Grid Forum in particular.


3.  Examples (Informative)

   Since no subnamespace identifiers have been defined yet, no actual
   examples can be given.  Therefore, the following examples are not
   guaranteed to be real or even syntactically correct.

   Grid forum documents defining the "gfd" and "network" subnamespace
   identifiers may give the following examples.

   o  urn:ogf:gfd:136

   o  urn:ogf:network:canarie.ca:kisti-uninett-glif-001

4.  Namespace Considerations

   The Open Grid Forum (OGF) is a standardisation development
   organisation in the field of distributed computing.

   The use of the OGF hierarchy is expected to be broad, including but
   not limit to usage for:

   o  Grid Forum Documents

   o  XML (Extensible Markup Language) Schemata

   o  RDF (Resource Description Framework) Schemata

   The Open Grid Forum is dedicated to openly publish all technical
   documentation related to URNs in the OGF hierarchy and allow
   unlimited distribution of these documents.


5.  Community Considerations

   Members of the distributed computing community will benefit from
   persistent and globally unique identifiers for use in protocols
   developed by the Open Grid Forum.

   Practical use of the urn:ogf namespace has been detected, and a
   formal registration will allow the Open Grid Forum to document this
   usage and enforce technical review of current practices.


6.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

   Implementors are recommended to check the OGF registry and
   documentation [URN-OGF] before assuming that a given identifier is
   valid or has a certain meaning.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is to kindly requested to register the "ogf" namespace
   identifier (NID) at the URN Namespaces registry [URN-NAMESPACES] and
   refer to this document and/or the website http://www.ogf.org/urn/.
