    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

      <t> This document defines attributes within RADIUS and Diameter that can be used to convey
        location-related information within authentication and accounting exchanges. </t>
      <t> Location information may be useful in a number of scenarios. Wireless networks (including
        wireless LAN) are being deployed in public places such as airports, hotels, shopping malls,
        and coffee shops by a diverse set of operators such as cellular network operators, Wireless
        Internet Service Providers (WISPs), and fixed broadband operators. In these situations, the
        home network may need to know the location of the user, in order to enable location-aware
        billing, location-aware authorization, or other location-aware services. Location
        information can also prove useful in other situations (such as wired networks) where
        operator network ownership and location information may be needed by the home network. </t>
      <t> In order to preserve user privacy, location information needs to be protected against
        unauthorized access and distribution. Requirements for access to location information are
        defined in <xref target="RFC3693"/>. The model includes a Location Generator (LG) that
        creates location information, a Location Server (LS) that authorizes access to location
        information, a Location Recipient (LR) that requests and receives information, and a Rule
        Maker (RM) that provides authorization policies to the LS which enforces access control
        policies on requests to location information. In <xref target="geopriv-requirements"/> the
        requirements for a GEOPRIV Using Protocol are compared to the functionality provided by this
        document.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
        "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
          <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      <t>RADIUS specific terminology is borrowed from <xref target="RFC2865"/> and <xref
          target="RFC2866"/>.</t>
      <t>Terminology related to privacy issues, location information and authorization policy rules
        is taken from <xref target="RFC3693"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <!-- ====================================================================== -->
    <section title="Delivery Methods for Location Information">

      <t>The following exchanges show how location information is conveyed in RADIUS. In describing
        the usage scenarios, we assume that privacy policies allow location to be conveyed in
        RADIUS; however, as noted in <xref target="diameter-radius"/> similar exchanges can also
        take place within Diameter. Privacy issues are discussed in <xref target="privacy"/>.</t>
      <section title="Location Delivery based on Out-of-Band Agreements">
        <t>
          <xref target="initial-auth-delivery"/> shows an example message flow for delivering
          location information during the network access authentication and authorization procedure.
          Upon a network authentication request from an access network client, the Network Access
          Server (NAS) submits a RADIUS Access-Request message that contains location information
          attributes among other required attributes. In this scenario location information is
          attached to the Access-Request message without an explicit request from the RADIUS server.
          Note that such an approach with a prior agreement between the RADIUS client and the RADIUS
          server is only applicable in certain environments, such as in situations where the RADIUS
          client and server are within the same administrative domain. The
          Basic-Location-Policy-Rules Attribute is populated based on the defaults described in
            <xref target="Basic-Location-Policy-Rules"/>, unless it has been explicitly configured
          otherwise. </t>

      <section title="Location Delivery based on Initial Request">
        <t> If the RADIUS client provides a Location-Capable Attribute in the Access-Request, then
          the RADIUS server MAY request the RADIUS client for location information if it requires
          that information for authorization, and location information was not provided in
          Access-Request. This exchange is shown in <xref target="challenge"/>. The inclusion of the
          Location-Capable Attribute in an Access-Request message indicates that the NAS is capable
          of providing location data in response to an Access-Challenge. The subsequent
          Access-Challenge message sent from the RADIUS server to the NAS provides a hint regarding
          the type of desired location information attributes. The NAS treats the
          Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and Extended-Location-Policy-Rules Attributes as opaque data
          (e.g., it echoes these rules provided by the server within the Access-Challenge back in
          the Access-Request). In the shown message flow the location attributes are then provided
          in the subsequent Access-Request message. When evaluating this Access-Request message the
          authorization procedure at the RADIUS server might be based on a number of criteria,
          including the newly defined attributes listed in <xref target="attributes"/>.</t>

      <section title="Location Delivery based on Mid-Session Request">
        <t> The on-demand mid-session location delivery method utilizes the Change of Authorization
          Request (CoA-Request) message and the CoA-NAK, defined in <xref target="RFC5176"/>. At any
          time during the session the Dynamic Authorization Client MAY send a CoA-Request containing
          session identification attributes to the NAS (i.e., Dynamic Authorization Server). </t>

        <t>In order to enable the on-demand mid-session location delivery method, the RADIUS server
          MUST return an instance of the Requested-Location-Info Attribute with the
          'FUTURE_REQUESTS' flag set and instances of the Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and
          Extended-Location-Policy-Rules Attributes in the Access-Accept message for the session.
          Upon receipt of a CoA-Request message containing a Service-Type Attribute with value
          "Authorize Only" for the same session, the NAS MUST include location information and echo
          the previously received Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and Extended-Location-Policy-Rules
          Attributes in the subsequent Access-Request message. </t>

        <t>Upon receiving the Access-Request message containing the Service-Type Attribute with a
          value of Authorize-Only from the NAS, the RADIUS server responds with either an
          Access-Accept or an Access-Reject message.</t>
        <t> The use of dynamic authorization <xref target="RFC5176"/> is necessary when location
          information is needed on-demand and cannot be obtained from accounting information in a
          timely fashion. </t>

        <t> When the Dynamic Authorization Client wants to change the values of the requested
          location information, or set the values of the requested location information for the
          first time, it may do so without triggering a reauthorization. Assuming that the NAS had
          previously sent an Access-Request containing a Location-Capable Attribute, the DAC can
          send a CoA-Request to the NAS without a Service-Type Attribute, but including the NAS
          Identifiers and Session identifiers as per <xref target="RFC5176"/> and the
          Requested-Location-Info, Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and Extended-Location-Policy-Rules
          Attributes. The Requested-Location-Info, Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and
          Extended-Location-Policy-Rules Attributes MUST NOT be used for session identification. </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="mid-session-authorization2"/> shows this approach graphically.</t>

        <t>Location Information may also be reported in accounting messages. Accounting messages are
          generated when the session starts, when the session stops and periodically during the
          lifetime of the session. Accounting messages may also be generated when the user roams
          during handoff.</t>
        <t>Accounting information may be needed by the billing system to calculate the user's bill.
          For example, there may be different tariffs or tax rates applied based on the location.</t>
        <t>If the RADIUS server needs to obtain location information in accounting messages then it
          needs to include a Requested-Location-Info Attribute to the Access-Accept message. The

      <t> The RADIUS attributes in this specification have no special translation requirements for

        relating to headers, alignment, and padding. See also Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC3588"
        /> and Section 9 of <xref target="RFC4005"/>.</t>
      <t> What this specification says about the applicability of the attributes for RADIUS
        Access-Request packets applies in Diameter to AA-Request <xref target="RFC4005"/> or

        about Access-Accept applies in Diameter to AA-Answer or Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that
        indicate success. Similarly, what is said about RADIUS Access-Reject packets applies in
        Diameter to AA-Answer or Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that indicate failure.</t>

    <section anchor="security-section" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>A number of security aspects are relevant for the distribution of location information via
        RADIUS. These aspects are discussed in separate sub-sections.</t>
      <section anchor="comsec" title="Communication Security">
        <t>Requirements for the protection of a Location Object are defined in <xref
            target="RFC3693"/>, namely mutual end-point authentication, data object integrity, data
          object confidentiality and replay protection. </t>
        <t>If no authentication, integrity and replay protection between the participating RADIUS
          entities is provided then adversaries can spoof and modify transmitted attributes. Two
          security mechanisms are proposed for RADIUS:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              <xref target="RFC2865"/> proposes the usage of a static key that raised concerns
              regarding the lack dynamic key management. At the time of writing, work is ongoing to
              address some shortcomings of <xref target="RFC2865"/> attribute security protection. </t>
            <t>RADIUS over IPsec <xref target="RFC3579"/> enables the use of standard key management
              mechanisms, such as KINK, IKE and IKEv2 <xref target="RFC4306"/>, to establish IPsec
              security associations. Confidentiality protection MUST be used to prevent eavesdropper
              gaining access to location information. Confidentiality protection already present for
              other reasons in many environments, such as for the transport of keying material in
              the context of EAP authentication and authorization. Hence, this requirement is, in
              many environments, already fulfilled. Mutual authentication MUST be provided between
              neighboring RADIUS entities to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Since mutual
              authentication is already required for key transport within RADIUS messages it does
              not represent a deployment obstacle. Since IPsec protection is suggested as a
              mechanism to protect RADIUS already no additional considerations need to be addressed
              beyond those described in <xref target="RFC3579"/>. </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>In case that IPsec protection is not available for some reason and RADIUS specific
          security mechanisms have to be used then the following considerations apply. The
          Access-Request message is not integrity protected. This would allow an adversary to change
          the contents of the Location Object or to insert, modify and delete attributes or
          individual fields. To address these problems the Message-Authenticator (80) can be used to
          integrity protect the entire Access-Request packet. The Message-Authenticator (80) is also
          required when EAP is used and hence is supported by many modern RADIUS servers.</t>
        <t>Access-Request packets including location attribute(s) without a
          Message-Authenticator(80) Attribute SHOULD be silently discarded by the RADIUS server. A
          RADIUS server supporting location attributes MUST calculate the correct value of the
          Message-Authenticator(80) and MUST silently discard the packet if it does not match the
          value sent.</t>
        <t>Access-Accept, including location attribute(s) without a Message-Authenticator(80)
          Attribute SHOULD be silently discarded by the NAS. A NAS supporting location attributes
          MUST calculate the correct value of a received Message-Authenticator(80) and MUST silently
          discard the packet if it does not match the value sent.</t>
        <t>RADIUS and Diameter make some assumptions about the trust between traversed RADIUS
          entities in the sense that object level security is not provided by neither RADIUS nor
          Diameter. Hence, some trust has to be placed on the RADIUS entities to behave according to
          the defined rules. Furthermore, the RADIUS protocol does not involve the user in their
          protocol interaction except for tunneling authentication information (such as EAP
          messages) through their infrastructure. RADIUS and Diameter have even become a de-facto
          protocol for key distribution for network access authentication applications. Hence, in
          the past there were some concerns about the trust placed into the infrastructure
          particularly from the security area when it comes to keying. The EAP keying infrastructure
          is described in <xref target="RFC4282"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
        <t>This section discusses privacy implications for the distribution of location information
          within RADIUS. Note also that it is possible for the RADIUS server to obtain some amount
          of location information from the NAS identifier. This document, however, describes
          procedures to convey more accurate location information about the end host and/or the
          network. In a number of deployment environments location information about the network
          also reveals the current location of the user with a certain degree of precision depending
          on the location determination mechanism used, update frequency, the size of the network
          and other factors, such as movement traces. </t>

            <t>Network access authentication procedures, such as PPP CHAP <xref target="RFC1994"/>
              or EAP <xref target="RFC4282"/>, may reveal the user's identity as a part of the
              authentication procedure. Techniques exist to avoid this problem in EAP methods, for
              instance by employing private Network Access Identifiers (NAIs) in the EAP Identity
              Response message <xref target="RFC4187"/> and by method-specific private identity
              exchange in the EAP method (e.g., <xref target="RFC4187"/>, <xref target="RFC5281"/>
              <xref target="I-D.josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap"/>, <xref target="RFC5106"/>). Support
              for identity privacy within CHAP is not available.</t>
            <t>RADIUS may return information from the home network to the visited in a manner that
              makes it possible to either identify the user or at least correlate his session with
              other sessions, such as the use of static data in a Class Attribute <xref
                target="RFC2865"/> or in some accounting attribute usage scenarios <xref
                target="RFC4372"/>.</t>
            <t>Mobility protocols may reveal some long-term identifier, such as a home address.</t>
            <t>Application layer protocols may reveal other permanent identifiers.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>To prevent the correlation of identities with location information it is necessary to
          prevent leakage of identity information from all sources, not just one. </t>
        <t>Unfortunately, most users are not educated about the importance of identity
          confidentiality and some protocols lack support for identity privacy mechanisms. This
          problem is made worse by the fact that users may be unable to choose particular protocols,
          as the choice is often dictated by the type of network operator they use, by the type of
          network they wish to access, the kind of equipment they have, or the type of
          authentication method they are using.</t>
        <t>A scenario where the user is attached to the home network is, from a privacy point of
          view, simpler than a scenario where a user roams into a visited network since the NAS and
          the home RADIUS server are in the same administrative domain. No direct relationship
          between the visited and the home network operator may be available and some RADIUS brokers
          need to be consulted. With subscription-based network access as used today the user has a
          contractual relationship with the home network provider that could (theoretically) allow
          higher privacy considerations to be applied (including policy rules stored at the home
          network itself for the purpose of restricting further distribution).</t>
        <t>In many cases it is necessary to secure the transport of location information along the
          RADIUS infrastructure. Mechanisms to achieve this functionality are discussed in <xref
            target="comsec"/>.</t>

      <t>This section compares the requirements for a GEOPRIV Using Protocol, described in <xref
          target="RFC3693"/>, against the approach of distributing Location Objects with RADIUS.</t>
      <t>In <xref target="match-1"/> and <xref target="match-2"/> we discuss privacy implications
        when RADIUS entities make location information available to other parties. In <xref
          target="req-match"/> the requirements are matched against these two scenarios.</t>
      <section anchor="match-1"
        title="Distribution of Location Information at the User's Home Network">
        <t>When location information is conveyed from the RADIUS client to the RADIUS server then it
          might subsequently be made available for different purposes. This section discusses the
          privacy implication for making location information available to other entities.</t>
        <t> To use a more generic scenario we assume that the visited RADIUS and the home RADIUS
          server belong to different administrative domains. The Location Recipient obtains location
          information about a particular Target via protocols specified outside the scope of this
          document (e.g., SIP, HTTP or an API).</t>

          as an index within the location database. One possible identifier is the Network Access
          Identifier. RFC 4282 <xref target="RFC4282"/> and RFC 4372 <xref target="RFC4372"/>
          provide background whether entities in the visited network can obtain the user's NAI in
          cleartext. </t>
        <t>The visited network provides location information to a Location Recipient (e.g., via SIP
          or HTTP). This document enables the NAS to obtain the user's privacy policy via the
          interaction with the RADIUS server. Otherwise only default policies, which are very
          restrictive, are available. This allows the Location Server in the visited network to
          ensure act according to the user's policies.</t>

      <t>Location information always travels with privacy policies. This document enables the RADIUS
        client to obtain these policies. The Location Server can subsequently act according to these
        policies to provide access control using the Extended-Location-Policy-Rules and to adhere
        the privacy statements in the Basic-Location-Policy-Rules.</t>
      <section anchor="req-match" title="Requirements matching">
        <t>Section 7.1 of <xref target="RFC3693"/> details the requirements of a "Location Object".
          We discuss these requirements in the subsequent list.</t>
        <t>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Req. 1.  (Location Object generalities):">
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>Regarding requirement 1.1, the syntax and semantic of the location object is
                  taken from the <xref target="RFC3825"/> and <xref target="RFC4776"/>. It is
                  furthermore possible to convert it to the format used in GMLv3 <xref
                    target="GMLv3"/>, as used with PIDF-LO <xref target="RFC4119"/>. </t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 1.2, a number of fields in the civic location information
                  format are optional.</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 1.3, the inclusion of type of place item (CAtype 29) used
                  in the DHCP civic format gives a further classification of the location. This
                  attribute can be seen as an extension.</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 1.4, this document does not define the format of the
                  location information. </t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 1.5, location information is only sent from the RADIUS
                  client to the RADIUS server.</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 1.6, the Location Object contains both location information
                  and privacy rules. Location information is described in <xref
                    target="Location-Information-Attribute-Attr"/>, in <xref target="civic-profile"
                  /> and in <xref target="geo-profile"/>. The corresponding privacy rules are
                  detailed in <xref target="Basic-Location-Policy-Rules"/> and in <xref
                    target="Extended-Location-Policy-Rules"/>.</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 1.7, the Location Object is usable in a variety of
                  protocols. The format of the object is reused from other documents as detailed in
                    <xref target="Location-Information-Attribute-Attr"/>, <xref
                    target="civic-profile"/>, <xref target="geo-profile"/>
                  <xref target="Basic-Location-Policy-Rules"/> and in <xref
                    target="Extended-Location-Policy-Rules"/>).</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 1.8, the encoding of the Location Object has an emphasis on
                  a lightweight encoding format to be used with RADIUS.</t>
              </list>
              <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            </t>
            <t hangText="Req. 2.  (Location Object fields):">
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>Regarding requirement 2.1, the Target Identifier is carried within the network
                  access authentication protocol (e.g., within the EAP-Identity Response when EAP is
                  used and/or within the EAP method itself). As described in <xref target="privacy"
                  /> it has a number of advantages if this identifier is not carried in clear. This
                  is possible with certain EAP methods whereby the identity in the EAP-Identity
                  Response only contains information relevant for routing the response to the user's
                  home network. The user identity is protected by the authentication and key
                  exchange protocol.</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 2.2, the Location Recipient is in the main scenario the
                  home RADIUS server. For a scenario where the Location Recipient is obtaining
                  Location Information from the Location Server via HTTP or SIP the respective
                  mechanisms defined in these protocols are used to identify the recipient. The
                  Location Generator cannot, a priori, know the recipients if they are not defined
                  in this protocol.</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 2.3, the credentials of the Location Recipient are known to
                  the RADIUS entities based on the security mechanisms defined in the RADIUS
                  protocol itself. <xref target="security-section"/> describes these security
                  mechanisms offered by the RADIUS protocol. The same is true for requirement 2.4.</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 2.5, <xref target="Location-Information-Attribute-Attr"/>,
                    <xref target="civic-profile"/> and <xref target="geo-profile"/> describe the
                  content of the location fields. Since the location format itself is not defined in
                  this document motion and direction vectors as listed in requirement 2.6 are not
                  defined. </t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 2.6, this document provides the capability for the RADIUS
                  server to indicate what type of location information it would like to see from the
                  RADIUS client. </t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 2.7, timing information is provided with 'sighting time'
                  and 'time-to-live' field defined in <xref
                    target="Location-Information-Attribute-Attr"/>.</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 2.8, a reference to an external (more detailed rule set) is
                  provided with the Extended-Location-Policy-Rules attribute <xref
                    target="Extended-Location-Policy-Rules"/> .</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 2.9, security headers and trailers are provided as part of
                  the RADIUS protocol or even as part of IPsec.</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 2.10, a version number in RADIUS is provided with the IANA
                  registration of the attributes. New attributes are assigned a new IANA number.</t>
              </list>
              <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            </t>
            <t hangText="Req. 3.  (Location Data Types):">
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>Regarding requirement 3.1, this document reuses civic and geospatial location
                  information as described in <xref target="geo-profile"/> and in <xref
                    target="civic-profile"/>.</t>
                <t>With the support of civic and geospatial location information support requirement
                  3.2 is fulfilled.</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 3.3, the geospatial location information used by this
                  document only refers to absolute coordinates. However, the granularity of the
                  location information can be reduced with the help of the AltRes, LoRes, LaRes
                  fields described in <xref target="RFC3825"/>.</t>
                <t>Regarding requirement 3.4, further Location Data Types can be added via new
                  coordinate reference systems (CRSs) (see Datum field in <xref target="RFC3825"/>)
                  and via extensions to <xref target="RFC3825"/> and <xref target="RFC4776"/>.</t>
              </list>
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Section 7.2 of <xref target="RFC3693"/> details the requirements of a "Using Protocol".
          These requirements are listed below:<vspace blankLines="1"/>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Req. 4.:">The using protocol has to obey the privacy and security
              instructions coded in the Location Object regarding the transmission and storage of
              the LO. This document requires that entities that aim to make location information
              available to third parties are required to obey the privacy instructions.<vspace

            </t>
            <t hangText="Req. 5.:">The using protocol will typically facilitate that the keys
              associated with the credentials are transported to the respective parties, that is,
              key establishment is the responsibility of the using protocol. <xref
                target="security-section"/> specifies how security mechanisms are used in RADIUS and
              how they can be reused to provide security protection for the Location Object.
              Additionally, the privacy considerations (see <xref target="privacy"/>) are also
              relevant for this requirement. <vspace blankLines="1"/>

            <t hangText="Req. 6.  (Single Message Transfer):">In particular, for tracking of small
              target devices, the design should allow a single message/packet transmission of

              privacy rule before transmitting location information from the NAS to the RADIUS
              server or even to third parties. In the case of an out-of-band agreement between the
              owner of the NAS and the owner of the RADIUS server privacy might be applied on a
              higher granularity. For the scenario shown in <xref target="req-scenario-1"/> the
              visited network is already in possession of the users location information prior to
              the authentication and authorization of the user. A correlation between the location
              and the user identity might, however, still not be possible for the visited network
              (as explained in <xref target="privacy"/>). A Location Server in the visited network

            <t hangText="Req. 12 (Identity Protection):">Support for unlinkable pseudonyms is
              provided by the usage of a corresponding authentication and key exchange protocol.
              Such protocols are available, for example, with the support of EAP as network access
              authentication methods. Some EAP methods support passive user identity confidentiality
              whereas others even support active user identity confidentiality. This issue is
              further discussed in <xref target="security-section"/>. The importance for user
              identity confidentiality and identity protection has already been recognized as an
              important property (see, for example, a document on 'EAP Method Requirements for
              Wireless LANs' <xref target="RFC4017"/>).<vspace blankLines="1"/>

              object integrity, data object confidentiality and replay protection. As described in
                <xref target="security-section"/> these requirements are fulfilled with the usage of
              IPsec if mutual authentication refers to the RADIUS entities (acting as various

              infrastructure elements is provided by the RADIUS protocol (including IPsec and its
              dynamic key management framework) rather than on relying on object security via S/SIME
