Abstract

   The Internet is in the early stages of what may be a protracted
   period of coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6.  Network operators are
   challenged with the task of activating IPv6 without negative impact
   on operating IPv4 networks and their customers.  This draft is an
   informational companion to another draft providing basic guidelines
   and recommendations for network operators.  The goal of this document
   is to survey the current state of RFCs, Internet-Drafts and external
   reference materials that define the use cases, problem statements,
   protocols, transition mechanisms and coexistence tools that will be
   of interest to a network operator planning to turn on IPv6.

1. Introduction

   Since the IPv6 protocol was defined in 1995 as RFC 1883 (replaced in
   1998 by RFC 2460) the Internet has been in a long transition from
   IPv4 to IPv6.  In reality, we are still in the early stages of what
   is likely to be a protracted period of coexistence, where IPv6
   penetration in hosts (both servers and clients) will gradually ramp
   up as networks make IPv6 available through their infrastructures.

   Network operators face a daunting task to design and implement plans
   to activate IPv6 without negative impact on large (in some cases very
   large) operating IPv4 networks with many live customers.  Some basic
   guidelines and recommendations for network operators are being
   developed (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lee-v4v6tran-problem-01)
   and this draft is an informational companion to that effort.  The
   goal of this document is to survey the current state of RFCs, active
   (and expired but still relevant) Internet-Drafts and external
   reference materials that define the use cases, problem statements,
   protocols, transition mechanisms and coexistence tools that will be
   of interest to a network operator planning to turn on IPv6.

   This is a dynamic and evolving marketplace of ideas.  At best, this
   draft is a blurry snapshot of the landscape near to the time of its
   publication.  The editor intends this compendium to be merely the
   starting point for an active database or wiki available for community
   contribution including feedback on the real-world experience of
   network operators as they turn on IPv6.

   The following sections comprise an annotated bibliography of the
   currently available documentation to knowledge of the editor.  It is
   provided as informational guidance only, and any network operator
   contemplating an IPv6 implementation will of course exercise due
   diligence in researching all the issues, standards and
   recommendations and analyze applicability to the particular network
   operation.

   Note that as the body of this text includes full reference
   information for the bibliography entries these are not included in
   the normal Reference section.

   This draft makes several recommendations to ensure user satisfaction
   and a smooth transition from HTTP's pervasive IPv4 to IPv6 and from

   This draft suggests that in an Internet Exchange Point one might use
   an address that helps in debugging routing exchanges.  One could also
   look at what other folks do, embedding identifying marks in
   addresses.  For example, Facebook includes "face:b00c" in the IID
   portion of their address.

6. Transition/Coexistence Tools

   As network operators and end-users independently proceed with
   transition to IPv6 while others continue to use IPv4, a potentially
   long period of coexistence will ensue.  Variations on terminology
   have been used since the specification of IPv6; transition implies a
   process whereby the star of IPv6 rises and the star of IPv4 sets;
   coexistence implies that both will operate together.  Due to
   thoroughly discussed limits to the growth of an Internet using only
   IPv4, IPv6 is a necessary technology for the future of the Internet.
   However, nothing compels the elimination of IPv4; no protocol police
   will forbid its use in the foreseeable future.  IPv4 may disappear
   due to irrelevance when IPv6 is so pervasive to make it redundant,
   but network operators should be prepared to operate IPv4 and IPv6 in
   a mixed deployment for some time.  However, the techniques and
   mechanisms supported by a network operator can be expected to evolve
   and change over time as a rational goal would be to gradually shift
   coexistence costs (real operational expense as well as convenience)
   from "early adopters" of IPv6 to the shrinking pool of IPv4
   maintainers.

   Various techniques are required for coexistence, roughly divided into
   three categories:

   1. Address Mapping:  Many situations will require the use of address
       mapping to maintain scalability in the face of dwindling IPv4
       global address space and to support translation and tunneling
       approaches.

   2. Tunneling:  A method for the encapsulation and transport of one
       protocol over or through the infrastructure that favors the
       other, e.g. IPv6 traffic via an IPv4 infrastructure

   3. Translation:  A mechanism for rewriting packets from one protocol
       to the other so they can be delivered as native (non-
       encapsulated) packets typically due to incompatible end nodes,
       e.g. an IPv6 client to an IPv4 server.

   These categories are not mutually exclusive, as some scenarios and
   solutions incorporate aspects of multiple approaches.

6.3. Translation

   From the earliest specification of IPv6 IETF contributors have
   recognized that translation would be a necessary tool for transition
   and coexistence, as IPv6 was designed as an incompatible replacement
   rather than an extension of IPv4.  The original approach to stateless
   translation defined in RFC 2765 and its implementation as NA(P)T-PT
   as described in RFC 2766 had a number of issues that resulting in the
   approach being deprecated by RFC 4966.  Recently the Behave WG has
   taken on the work of defining a set of scenarios covering the use
   cases for translation, prioritizing the work and defining new
   solutions that overcome the deficiencies of the historic approach.

6.3.1. Historic Approach

   PT)." G. Tsirtsis and P. Srisresh, February 2000
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2766

6.3.2. Current Translation Approaches

   A renewed effort to define new translation mechanisms started with
   discussions in the Internet Area (intarea) meeting and the Technical
   Plenary at IETF 71 in Dublin, and contined at a special meeting in
   Montreal in October 2008.  This led to a commitment by contributors
   in the Behave WG to take on the work.  A set of scenarios were
   defined along with a framework for the translation solutions.

   2010
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-behave-v6v4-framework-10

   This draft (Framework) is the place to start to understand the
   historic context for translation, the definition and rationale for
   the set of translation scenarios and canonical definitions for some
   of the terminology that arises when talking about translation and
   coexistence in general.

   The 4 deployment modes for these scenarios are:

   1. Connecting between the IPv4 Internet and the IPv6 Internet

   2. Connecting an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet

   3. Connecting an IPv4 network to the IPv6 Internet

   4. Connecting between an IPv4 network and an IPv6 network

   As solutions may differ with respect to the initiating end of the
   conversation, 8 scenarios are defined in the Framework draft, as
   recapped in the following sections along with specifications that fit
   each scenario.

   Some general specifications that are cited in the various solution
   specifications are:

   Clients to IPv4 Servers" M. Bagnulo et al.  July 5, 2010
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-behave-dns64-10

6.3.2.1. An IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet

   The Framework defines Scenario 1 for an early adopter (end user or
   network operator) which establishes an IPv6 network and needs to
   maintain access to the global IPv4 Internet, preferably without
   assigning IPv4 addresses to the nodes of the IPv6 network.  Either
   the Stateful or Stateless solutions proposed may satisfy this
   deployment scenario.

   deprecated (by RFC 4966).  The Stateless Translation solution for
   Scenario 1 also would work for this case as it does support IPv4-
   initiated communication with a subset of IPv6 addresses.

6.3.2.3. The IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 network

   The Framework defines Scenario 3 where a legacy IPv4 network has a
   requirement to provide services to users in the IPv6 Internet.
   Stateful Translation with static AAAA records in DNS to represent the

6.3.2.4. An IPv4 network to the IPv6 Internet

   Scenario 4 is not easy to solve but fortunately will not arise until
   significant IPv6 uptake.  In-network translation is not viable, and
   other techniques should be considered.

6.3.2.5. An IPv6 network to an IPv4 network

   Scenario 5 describes a configuration where both the IPv6 network and
   IPv4 network are within the administrative control of the same
   organization.  It appears amenable to the same solutions proposed for
   Scenario 1.

6.3.2.6. An IPv4 network to an IPv6 network

   Scenario 6 is the mirror image of Scenario 5, with communication
   initiated from the IPv4 side.  It appears amenable to the same
   solution proposed for Scenario 2.

6.3.2.7. The IPv6 Internet to the IPv4 Internet

   The Framework indicates that Scenario 7, the interconnection of the
   IPv4 Internet with the IPv6 Internet may appear to be an ideal case
   for an in-network translator (such as the deprecated NAT-PT), but
   there is no viable way to map the immense IPv6 address space onto
   IPv4.  This situation would not entail until significant IPv6
   adoption, and has not been a priority for solution.

   The IPv6 addressing architecture presumes that the remaining 64 bits
   are an endpoint interface identifier.  This could be the MAC Address
   (EUI-64 Address) in an appropriate encoding, or it could be what is
   called a "privacy address", which is a random number.  You will find
   the most common approach to that, for hosts, in this RFC.

11. Security Considerations

   This draft does not introduce any security considerations.

12. IANA Considerations

   This draft does not require any action from IANA.

   [Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed.]

13. Conclusions

   This draft is merely the starting point for a network operator
   planning an IPv6 rollout.  The intention of the editor was to
   document the great work that is already available that can help in
   the process and to perhaps save a few hours of redundant effort for
   someone to find this information.  Of course, this will be out of
   date before it is published as active research continues in
   coexistence and transition tools.  The editor hopes it is at least a
   useful "You Are Here" map to help navigate the thrill rides available
   in the IPv6 theme park.

   This compendium could serve as an initial set of data to populate an
   active database or wiki.  This would allow continuing community
   contribution including feedback on the real-world experience of
   network operators as they turn on IPv6.

14. References

14.1. Normative References

   None.

14.2. Informative References

   Complete reference information is included in the body of the draft.

15. Acknowledgments

   In addition to the authors of the cited RFCs, drafts, websites and
   other publications and many folks on the v6ops and v4v6transition
   mailing lists, the editor wishes to acknowledge significant
   contributions from Fred Baker, Brian Carpenter, Remi Despres, Tina
   Tsou, Yiu Lee, Marc Blanchet and many contributors on the v4v6trans
   mailing list https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/v4tov6transition
