Internet-Draft        COPS-PR and SPPI to Historic        September 2009


1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this document is to reclassify the COPS Usage for
   Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR) [RFC3084] and the Structure of Policy
   Provisioning Information (SPPI) [RFC3159] along with the
   Differentiated Services Quality of Service Policy Information Base
   [RFC3317], the Framework Policy Information Base [RFC3318], and the
   Framework Policy Information Base for Usage Feedback [RFC3571] to
   Historic status.


2.  Reclassification

   The COPS-PR protocol was designed to provision policy information
   from a Policy Decision Point (PEP) to a Policy Enforcement Point
   (PEP).  The SPPI data modeling language supports COPS-PR by providing
   a framework for specifying so called Policy Information Bases (PIBs).

   The COPS-PR / SPPI technology has seen limited deployment.  The
   Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning data models created within the
   IETF [RFC3317], [RFC3318], [RFC3571] did not reach IETF concensus for
   publication on the standards-track and have since then been
   Informational documents.

   An IAB Network Management Workshop held in 2002 [RFC3535] lead to the
   creation of the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC4741]
   and the associated YANG data modeling language [YANG].  These new
   protocols are specifically designed to match the needs of network
   operators and all configuration management related efforts in the
   IETF are not centered on NETCONF and YANG.

   It is therefore appropriate to reclassify COPS-PR and SPPI to
   Historic status, as described in [RFC2026].  Along with this action,
   the QoS provisioning data models written in the SPPI language and
   published in [RFC3317], [RFC3318], and [RFC3571] are reclassified to
   Historic status as well.


3.  Security Considerations

   Reclassifying RFC 3084, RFC 3159, RFC 3317, RFC 3318, and RFC 3571
   has no security implications.


4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA rules for registering PIB modules defined in [RFC3159]
   remain in force.
