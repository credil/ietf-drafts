One of those is the "VALARM" component which appears as a sub-component of "VEVENT" and "VTODO" components. The "VALARM" component is used to specify a reminder for an event or to-do. Different alarm actions are possible, as are different ways to specify how the alarm is triggered.            </t>            <t>                As iCalendar has become more widely used and as client-server protocols such as <xref target="RFC4791">CalDAV</xref> have become more popular, several issues with "VALARM" components have arisen. Most of these relate to the need to extend the existing "VALARM" component with new properties and behaviors to allow clients and servers to accomplish specific tasks in an interoperable manner. For example, clients typically need a way to specify that an alarm has been dismissed by a calendar user, or has been "snoozed" by a set amount of time. To date, this has been done through the use of custom "X-" properties specific to each client implementation, leading to poor interoperability.            </t>            <t>                This specification defines a set of extensions to "VALARM" components to cover common requirements for alarms not currently addressed in iCalendar. Each extension is defined in a separate section below. For the most part, each extension can be supported independently of the others, though in some cases one extension will require another. In addition, this specification describes mechanisms by which clients can interoperably implement common features such as "snoozing".            </t>        </section>        <section title='Conventions Used in This Document'>            <t>                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119' />.            </t>            <t>                When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" are referenced in this document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" and "CALDAV:" will be prefixed to the element type names respectively.            </t>        </section>        <section title="Extensible syntax for VALARM" anchor="syntax">            <t>                Section 3.6.6 of <xref target="RFC5545"/> defines the syntax for "VALARM" components and properties within them. However, as written, it is hard to extend this by adding, e.g., a new property common to all types of alarm. Since many of the extensions defined in this document need to extend the base syntax, an alternative form for the base syntax is defined here, with the goal of simplifying specification of the extensions.            </t>            <t>                A "VALARM" calendar component is re-defined by the following notation:<figure><artwork name="abnf"><![CDATA[alarmcext  = "BEGIN" ":" "VALARM" CRLF             alarmprop             "END" ":" "VALARM" CRLFalarmprop  = *(             ; the following are REQUIRED,             ; but MUST NOT occur more than once             action / trigger /             ; one set of action properties MUST be             ; present and MUST match the action specified             ; in the ACTION property             actionprops /             ; the following is OPTIONAL,             ; and MAY occur more than once             x-prop / iana-prop             )        actionprops = audiopropext / disppropext / emailpropextaudiopropext  = *(                ; 'duration' and 'repeat' are both OPTIONAL,                ; and MUST NOT occur more than once each,                ; but if one occurs, so MUST the other                        duration / repeat /                        ; the following is OPTIONAL,                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once                        attach                        )disppropext = *(              ; the following are REQUIRED,              ; but MUST NOT occur more than once                     description /                      ; 'duration' and 'repeat' are both OPTIONAL,              ; and MUST NOT occur more than once each,              ; but if one occurs, so MUST the other                      duration / repeat                      )emailpropext = *(               ; the following are all REQUIRED,               ; but MUST NOT occur more than once                       description / summary /                       ; the following is REQUIRED,               ; and MAY occur more than once                       attendee /                       ; 'duration' and 'repeat' are both OPTIONAL,               ; and MUST NOT occur more than once each,               ; but if one occurs, so MUST the other                       duration / repeat                       )]]></artwork></figure>        </t>        </section>        <section title="VALARM Unique Identifier">            <t>                Several of the other extensions in this specification require identifying a specific instance of a "VALARM" component in an iCalendar stream. To aid that, this extension adds a "UID" property to "VALARM" components to allow a unique identifier to specified. The value of this property can then be used to refer uniquely to the "VALARM" component.            </t>            <t>                The "UID" property defined here follows the definition in Section 3.8.4.7 of <xref target="RFC5545"/>. In particular it MUST be a globally unique identifier.             </t>            <t>                The "VALARM" component defined in <xref target="syntax"/> is extended here as:<figure><artwork name="abnf">alarmprop  /= *(              ; the following is OPTIONAL,              ; but MUST NOT occur more than once              uid              )</artwork></figure>            </t>        </section>        <section title="VALARM URI Action" anchor='URI-ACTION'>            <t>                Currently "VALARM" components have actions for audio, display and email. New types of action are of interest, e.g., SMS, instant messaging, etc. Rather then specify separate actions for these, an alternative is to define a "URI" action that allows any URI scheme to be used as an action, where it makes sense. Thus URI schemes for IM <xref target="RFC3860"/>, SIP <xref target="RFC3261"/>, TEL <xref target="RFC3966"/> etc could be used.            </t>            <t>                This extension defines a new "URI" property value for use with the "ACTION" property in "VALARM" components. A new set of action properties is defined for "VALARM" components based on this new action as defined by the syntax below.<figure><artwork name="abnf">actionvalue /= "URI"               ; Adds a new action for a "VALARM"actionprop  /= uriprop               ; Re-defines the "VALARM" component to include               ; "uriprop" as a new set of action properties uriprop     = *(               ; the following is REQUIRED,               ; and MUST occur only once               uri /               ; 'duration' and 'repeat' are both OPTIONAL,               ; and MUST NOT occur more than once each,               ; but if one occurs, so MUST the other               duration / repeat               )</artwork></figure>            </t>        </section>        <section title="VALARM Agent Property">            <t>                With the advent of a standard client/server protocol for calendaring and scheduling data (<xref target="RFC4791"/>) there is a need to specify which client or server should handle the presentation of an alarm when it is triggered. For example, calendar users want to be able to receive alarms at all times, even when their desktop client might be unavailable. Since the server is "always on", a service running on the server could monitor alarm status and, when appropriate, trigger those alarms. In addition it may be important for only the server or the client to be set to handle an alarm - and in some cases only specific servers or clients.            </t>            <t>                To address this need, this specification defines an "ALARM-AGENT" iCalendar property that can be added to any "VALARM" component. This property specifies whether a client or server or both should be responsible for processing the alarm when it triggers. In addition, a "ID" property parameter can be added to uniquely identify the client or server that should process the alarm. This is defined by the syntax below.<figure><artwork name="abnf">alarmprop  /= *(              ; the following is OPTIONAL,              ; and MAY occur more than once              alarm-agent              )</artwork></figure>            </t>            <section title="Alarm Agent Property" anchor="ALARM-AGENT">                <t>                    <list style="hanging">                        <t hangText="Property Name:">                            ALARM-AGENT                        </t>                        <t hangText="Purpose:">                            This property specifies whether a client, server, both or none gets to process an alarm when it is triggered.                         </t>                        <t hangText="Value Type:">                            TEXT                         </t>                        <t hangText="Property Parameters:">                            IANA, non-standard, and id property parameters can be specified on this property.                         </t>                        <t hangText="Conformance:">                            This property can be specified within "VALARM" calendar components.                         </t>                        <t hangText="Description:">                            This property is used to specify who is responsible for processing an alarm when it is triggered.

When the value "BOTH" is specified, either a client or server is responsible. When the value "NONE" is specified, neither a client nor server is responsible (i.e., the alarm action is never carried out when it triggers).                                                        <vspace blankLines="1" />                            If the "ID" property parameter is specified for "SERVER" or "CLIENT" values, then only the client or server identified by the "ID" value is responsible.

That process effectively creates a new alarm to be triggered a set amount of time after the original being "snoozed". To accomplish this, clients SHOULD create a new "VALARM" component within the same component of the "VALARM" that was triggered and is being "snoozed". The new "VALARM" MUST be set to trigger at the user's chosen "snooze" interval after the original alarm triggered. To accomplish that clients SHOULD use an absolute "TRIGGER" property with a "DATE-TIME" value specified in UTC. When the "snooze" alarm is triggered and dismissed the client SHOULD remove it from its parent component. Alternatively, if the "snooze" alarm is itself "snoozed", the client SHOULD remote the original "snooze" alarm and create a new one, with the appropriate trigger time set.            </t>        </section>        <section title="VALARM Proximity Trigger Property">            <t>                VALARMs are currently triggered when a specific date-time is reached.

Since this behavior is expected to occur no matter which client a user is using, or whether any client is even connected at the time, it is beneficial if the server itself is responsible for managing the creation of the default alarm.</t>            <t>                This specification defines four new WebDAV properties that can be used to specify different sets of default alarms. Clients can store "VALARM" components in these properties to setup the defaults. When a new event or todo is created on the server, the server will automatically add the default, as appropriate. When a new event or todo invitation is delivered to the calendar user, the server will automatically add the default alarm, as appropriate.            </t>            <t>                The four new WebDAV properties are:                <list style='hanging'>                    <t hangText="CALDAV:default-alarm-vevent-datetime">A default alarm applied to "VEVENT" components whose "DTSTART" property value type is "DATE-TIME"</t>                    <t hangText="CALDAV:default-alarm-vevent-date">A default alarm applied to "VEVENT" components whose "DTSTART" property value type is "DATE"</t>                    <t hangText="CALDAV:default-alarm-vtodo-datetime">A default alarm applied to "VTODO" components whose "DUE" or "DTSTART" property value type is "DATE-TIME"</t>                    <t hangText="CALDAV:default-alarm-vtodo-date">A default alarm applied to "VTODO" components whose "DUE" or "DTSTART" property value type is "DATE", or when neither of those properties is present</t>                </list>            </t>            <t>                The WebDAV properties are defined on a calendar user's "calendar home" collection, or on individual calendar collections. When events or tasks are created in a calendar, the server will first inspect the WebDAV properties on the calendar collection to see if the appropriate property is present. If it is, the server will use the value of that property to set the default in the new component. If the property is not present on the calendar collection, the server will determine whether the property is present on the calendar home collection that contains the calendar collection. If present on the calendar home, the property value there is used as the default.            </t>            <t>                The WebDAV property value MUST be one or more "VALARM" components or the empty string. If an empty string is used, no default alarms are applied.
