Abstract 

   This document defines extensions to LSP Ping [RFC 4379] to enable 
   the return path(s) of an echo reply message, so that it can be 
   specified when sending an echo request message to perform LSP 
   failure detection, and the echo reply message is extended to detect 
   the return path(s). This capability could improve the reliability of 
   echo reply and allows failure detection of a Bidirectional LSP or 
   two unidirectional LSPs being performed by one message, resulting in 
   operational saving.

Internet-Draft     Return Path Specified LSP Ping            July 2009 
    

    
1. Introduction 

   This document defines the extensions to LSP Ping that can be used to 
   specify the return path(s) of the echo reply message in a LSP Ping 
   echo request message. Several new reply mode requirements are added 
   and a new Type-Length-Value (TLV) is defined.  

   With the extensions described in this document, the operators can 
   detect a Co-routed Bidirectional LSP and Associated Bidirectional 
   LSP with a single operational action, resulting in operational 
   savings.  It can also detect two unidirectional LSPs without any 
   inherency or binding relationship (one for each direction) in one 
   operational action as well, reduces the opportunity for error, and 
   improves the reliability of the echo reply message. 

   In this document, Bidirectional LSP includes Co-routed Bidirectional 
   LSP defined in [RFC 3471] [RFC 3473] and Associated Bidirectional 
   LSP that is constructed from a pair of unidirectional LSPs (one for 
   each direction), and are associated with one another at the LSP's 
   ingress/egress points. In the rest of this document, if there is no 
   extra explanation, when say Bidirectional LSP, it includes both Co-
   routed Bidirectional LSP and Associated Bidirectional LSP. 

2. Problem statements and solution overview 

   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping 
   is defined in [RFC 4379].  It can be used to detect data plan 
   failures in MPLS LSPs. More specifically, it is designed for 
   unidirectional LSPs. 

   Co-routed Bidirectional LSP is defined in [RFC 3471] [RFC 3473], but 
   with the existing LSP Ping mechanisms defined in [RFC 4379], the 
   operators have to perform LSP detection on each of the two ends of a 
   specific Bidirectional LSP respectively.  It not only doubles the 
   workload of the operators, but may also bring additional 
   difficulties when checking the backward direction of the LSP under 
   the following conditions 

     1. The LSR that the operator logged on to perform the checking 
     operations may not have out-of-band connectivity to the remote LSR 
     of the LSP.  That can result in failing to check the return 
     direction of the Bidirectional LSP.  

     2. The tested LSP is an inter-domain/inter-AS LSP, the operator of 
     one domain/AS may have no right to log on to the remote LSR reside 

 
 
Chen, et al.           Expires January 2, 2010                [Page 3] 

Internet-Draft     Return Path Specified LSP Ping            July 2009 
    

     in another domain/AS. That can also result in failing to check the 
     return direction of the Bidirectional LSP. 

     3. The return path of the echo reply message is randomly 
     determined by the egress of the LSP.  However, there can be more 
     than one LSPs connecting the two LSRs.  When a LSP Ping echo 
     request for detecting one Bidirectional LSP reached remote LSR, 
     the remote LSR may choose another LSP as the return path.  This 
     can result in mis-information and mis-diagnostics. 

   For Associated Bidirectional LSPs and even unidirectional LSPs, they 
   have the similar issues listed above. 

   This document defines the extensions to LSP Ping that can be used to 
   specify the return path(s) of the echo reply message in a LSP echo 
   request message.  A new TLV is defined to carry the specific return 
   path(s) information required by the initiator.  Several new reply 
   mode requirements are added.  For example, this document specifies 
   that the echo reply should return along the back direction LSP of 
   the tested Bidirectional LSP, or the specific return path(s) as 
   defined in the echo request message. 

   The detail extensions and procedures are defined in the following   
   sections. 

3. Extensions  

   LSP Ping defined in [RFC 4379] is carried out by sending echo 
   request message.  It carries the Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) 
   information of the tested LSP for indicating which MPLS path is 
   being verified, along the same data path as other normal data 
   packets belonging to the FEC. 

   The only determinant of the echo reply message return path is the 
   four reply modes defined in Section 3 of [RFC 4379].  But it is not 
   enough for the egress LSR of the tested LSP to determine how to 
   choose the return path(s) of the echo reply message. 

   This document defines a new reply mode, Reply Via Specified Path 
   mode. This new mode can be used to direct the egress of the tested 
   LSP to send back the echo reply message along the path specified in 
   the echo request message. 

   This document also adds a new TLV, Reply Path TLV.  The Reply Path 
   TLV consists one or more sub-TLVs that can be used to carry the

Internet-Draft     Return Path Specified LSP Ping            July 2009 
    

   specified return path information of an echo reply message.  The 
   detail definitions listed below. 

3.1. Reply Via Specified Path mode 

   The recommended value of the Reply via specified path mode is 5 
   (SHOULD be confirmed by the IANA). 

         Value    Meaning 
         -----    ------- 
             5     Reply via specified path 
            
   The Reply via specified path mode is used to notify the remote LSR 
   received the LSP Ping echo request message to send back the echo 
   reply message along the specified path(s) carried in the Reply Path 
   TLV. 

3.2. The return codes 

   This document defines two new return codes that can be used to 
   inform the sender the results of the testing. 

         Value    Meaning 
         -----    ------- 
            14    Success to match the specified path 
            15    The specified reply path not existence 
          
   Return code 15 is used when egress fails to match the specified 
   reply path which is designated by ingress node. For example ingress 
   node expects to detect the reply path of the bidirectional LSP, but 
   the path being tested isn't bidirectional indeed, and also the 
   condition that the specified path does not exist on egress.  Return 
   code 14 will be used when egress matches the specified reply path 
   successfully. The detailed usage of the return codes is described in 
   Section 4. 

3.3. Reply Path (RP) TLV 

   The Reply Path (RP) TLV is included in an echo request message. It 
   carries the specified return path(s) that the echo reply message 
   required to follow. The format of RP TLV is as follows:

   ~                                                               ~ 
   |                                                               |   
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   RP TLV Type field is 2 octets in length, and the type value is TBD 
   (which is needed to be assigned by IANA). 

   Length field is 2 octets in length.  It defines the length in octets 
   of the Reply Path(s) field. 

   Reply Path(s) field is variable in length.  It has several nested 
   sub-TLVs that describe the specified path(s) the echo reply message 
   is required to follow.  Each of the FEC sub-TLVs defined in [RFC 
   4379] is applicable to be a sub-TLV for inclusion in the RP TLV for 
   expressing a specific return path.  

   In addition, two more new sub-TLVs are defined, Bidirectional sub-
   TLV and Any Candidate sub-TLV. 

3.4. Bidirectional sub-TLV 

   The Bidirectional sub-TLV is used when the return path is required 
   to follow the back direction of the tested Bidirectional LSP.  The 
   format of Bidirectional sub-TLV is as follows: 

   0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |  Bidirectional sub-TLV Type   |          Length               |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
    
   The Bidirectional sub-TLV Type field is 2 octets in length, and the 
   type value is 17 (which is needed to be confirmed by IANA). 

   Length field is 2 octets in length, the value of length field MUST 
   be 0, it means that there is no any value fields follows.

3.5. Any Candidate sub-TLV 

   The Any Candidate sub-TLV is used when the return path is required 
   to exclude the path(s) that are identified by any other reply path 
   sub-TLVs carried in the echo request message. This is very useful 
   when one/several previous LSP Ping(s) failed. By carrying an Any 
   Candidate sub-TLV and the previous failed reply path sub-TLVs, a new 
   LSP Ping echo request could be used to help the egress to select 
   another candidate path when sending echo reply message.  The format 
   of Any Candidate sub-TLV is as follows: 

   0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |  Any Candidate sub-TLV Type   |          Length               |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
    
   The Any Candidate sub-TLV Type field is 2 octets in length, and the 
   type value is 18 (which is needed to be confirmed by IANA). 

   Length field is 2 octets in length, the value of length field MUST 
   be 0, it means that there is no any value fields follows. 

4. Theory of Operation 

   The procedures defined in this document only apply to "ping" mode, 
   how to deal with "traceroute" mode is out of the scope of this 
   document. 

   In RFC 4379, the echo reply is used to report the LSP checking 
   result to the LSP Ping initiator.  This document defines a new reply 
   mode and a new TLV (RP TLV) to enable that the return path of the 
   echo reply message could specified by the LSP Ping initiator, and 
   the function of echo reply is extended to detect the return path by 
   carrying specified path FEC TLV. It enables LSP Ping to detect both 
   directions of a path in one operation.  

   When the echo reply message is intended to test the return MPLS LSP 
   path as specified, the destination IP address of the echo reply 
   message is never used in a forwarding decision. For the purpose of 
   detection the specified return MPLS LSP path, the echo reply message 
   also needs to avoid IP forward at the condition of the LSP being 
   tested broken. So the destination IP address of the echo reply 
   message that is transmitted along the specified return path MUST be 
   set numbers from the range 127/8 for IPv4 or 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:127/104 
   for Ipv6, and the IP TTL MUST be set 1.  If the echo reply message 
 
 
Chen, et al.           Expires January 2, 2010                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft     Return Path Specified LSP Ping            July 2009 
    

   is not intended for testing the specified return path, the same as 
   defined in [RFC 4379], the destination IP address is copied from the 
   source IP address of the echo request. 

4.1. Sending an Echo Request 

   When sending an echo request, in addition to the rules and 
   processing defined in Section 4.3 of [RFC 4379], the reply mode of 
   the echo request MUST be set to "Reply via specified path", and a RP 
   TLV MUST be carried in the echo request message correspondingly. The 
   RP TLV includes one or several reply path sub-TLV(s) to identify the 
   return path(s) that is used to notify the egress which path(s) to 
   send along. 

   For Bidirectional LSP, since the ingress and egress of a 
   Bidirectional LSP are aware of the relationship between the forward 
   and backward direction LSPs, only a Bidirectional sub-TLV SHOULD be 
   carried within the RP TLV. If the operator wants the echo reply to 
   be sent along a different path other than the reverse LSP of the 
   Bidirectional LSP, another FEC sub-TLV SHOULD be carried in the RP 
   TLV instead. 

   In some cases, operators may want to detect two unidirectional LSPs 
   (one for each direction) as a pair. There may not be any binding 
   relationship between the two LSPs. Using the mechanism defined in 
   this document, operators can run LSP Ping one time from one end to 
   complete the failure detection on both unidirectional LSPs. In such 
   condition, when sending the echo request message, one specific FEC 
   sub-TLV MUST be carried in the RP TLV to notify the egress which 
   path to send along and detect. 

4.2. Receiving an Echo Request 

   Those processing relevant to "ping" mode defined in Section 4.4 of 
   [RFC 4379] apply in this document. In addition, when an echo request 
   received, if the egress does not know the reply mode defined in this 
   document, an echo reply with return code set to "Malformed echo 
   request" and the Subcode set to zero SHOULD be send back to the 
   ingress. If the egress knows the reply mode, according to the RP TLV, 
   it SHOULD find and select a matched return path, if there is no such 
   a path, an echo reply with return code set to "The specified reply 
   path not existence" and the Subcode to zero SHOULD be sent back to 
   the ingress. If there is a match, an echo reply with return code set 
   to "Success to match the specified path" and Subcode to zero SHOULD 
   be sent back to the ingress.

Internet-Draft     Return Path Specified LSP Ping            July 2009 
    

   When received an echo request with reply mode set to "Reply via 
   specified path", if there is no Any Candidate sub-TLV included in 
   the RP TLV, means that the echo reply is required to send along the 
   specified path and to detect the return path as well. Otherwise, 
   means that the echo reply is not required to detect the return path. 

4.3. Sending an Echo Reply 

   As described in [RFC 4379], the echo reply message is a UDP packet, 
   and it MUST only be sent response to an MPLS echo request. The 
   source IP address is a routable IP address of the replier, the 
   source UDP port is the well-know UDP port for LSP ping. 

   When the echo reply is intended to test the return path, the 
   destination IP address of the echo reply message MUST be never used 
   in a forwarding decision. For the purpose of detection the specified 
   return MPLS LSP path, the echo reply message also needs to avoid IP 
   forward at the condition of the LSP being tested broken. So the 
   destination IP address of the echo reply message that is transmitted 
   along the specified return path MUST be set numbers from the range 
   127/8 for IPv4 or 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:127/104 for Ipv6, and the IP TTL 
   MUST be set 1.  If the echo reply is required to test the return 
   path, the echo reply MUST have an FEC stack TLV about the return 
   path, which is used for the ingress to perform FEC validation. The 
   FEC stack TLV of the forward path MUST NOT be copied to the echo 
   reply. 

   If the echo reply message is not intended for testing the specified 
   return path, the same as defined in [RFC 4379], the destination IP 
   address and UDP port are copied from the source IP address and 
   source UDP port of the echo request.  

   When sending the echo reply, the RP TLV carried in the received echo 
   request MAY be copied to the echo reply to give the Ingress enough 
   information about the back direction tested path to verify the 
   consistent of the data plane against control plane.  

4.4. Receiving an Echo Reply 

   The rules and process defined in Section 4.6 of [RFC 4379] apply 
   here. And when an echo reply received, if the reply mode is "Reply 
   via specified path" and an FEC stack TLV exists, it means that the 
   echo reply has both Ping result reporting and reverse path checking 
   functions. The ingress MUST do FEC validation as an egress does when 
   received an echo request, the FEC validation process (relevant to 
   "ping" mode) defined in Section 4.4.1 of [RFC 4379] apply here.

   request received" and the Subcode set to zero. It's possible that 
   the egress may not know the "Reply via specified path" reply mode, 
   the operator may choose to re-perform another LSP Ping by using one 
   of the four reply modes defined [RFC 4379]. 

   When the LSP Ping initiator failed to receive the echo reply message, 
   the operator MAY initiate another LSP Ping by resending a new echo 
   request carrying a RP TLV that includes an Any Candidate sub-TLV and 
   the previous sent reply path sub-TLV(s) (Bidirectional sub-TLV or 
   FEC sub-TLVs) to notify the egress LSR to send echo reply message 
   along any other workable path (no matter what MPLS LSP or IP path) 
   excluding the path(s) identified by those Bidirectional sub-TLV 
   or/and FEC sub-TLVs. Hence it could improve the reliability of the 
   echo reply message. In such mode, the echo reply SHOULD NOT be used 
   to detect the return path. 

5. Security Considerations 

   Security considerations discussed in [RFC 4379] applies to this 
   document. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to make the following allocations from registries 
   under its control. 

6.1. Reply mode and return codes 

   IANA is requested to assign a new reply mode and two new return 
   codes as follows: 

   Reply mode: 

      Value    Meaning 
      -----    ------- 
          5    Reply via specified path 
       
   Return codes:

      Value    Meaning 
      -----    ------- 
         14   Success to match the specified path 
         15   The specified reply path not existence 
       
6.2. RP TLV 

   IANA is requested to assign a new TLV type (TBD) from the range of 
   0-16383. We suggest that the value 20 be assigned for the new RP TLV 
   type. 

       Type    Value Field 
      -----    ----------- 
         20    Reply Path 
       
6.3. Sub-TLVs for RP TLV 

   This document defines two new sub-TLV Types (described in Section 
   3.4 and 3.5) of RP TLV, and those FEC sub-TLVs defined in [RFC 4379] 
   are applicable for inclusion in RP TVL. 

   IANA is requested to assign sub-TLVs as follows. The following 
   numbers are suggested:
