Abstract          

   Several applications could use a mechanism to quickly notify one or
   more routers about control-protocol events. Current mechanisms to
   convey such information to routers multiple hops away involves hop-
   by-hop protocol-specific control plane processing as well as hop-by-
   hop control plane forwarding. The delay due to control planes
   involvement in processing/forwarding, adversely affects the
   application's goal (e.g. fast convergence). This document describes a
   framework to use data plane forwarding to convey control protocol
   information multiple hops away. It also defines some sample
   applications within this framework.

1.  Introduction

   There are several applications that could use a mechanism to quickly
   notify one or more routers in a network about a specific control-
   protocol event. If the destination router(s) is more than one hop
   away then the message has to be forwarded by the intermediate
   routers. This forwarding typically does not exclusively happen via
   the forwarding plane.

   Some applications establish adjacent neighbor relationship with
   single hop neighbors. Information that needs to be conveyed multiple
   hops away is first conveyed to adjacent neighbors that are a single
   hop away. Each neighbor then performs application specific processing
   and forwards information further. The delay in receiving the
   information at a router is gated by the processing and forwarding
   speed of the control plane at each hop along a path from the
   originating router.

   A typical example of an application that sends information to
   directly connected adjacent neighbors is a link-state routing
   interior gateway protocol (IGP) such as [OSPF]. When conveying a Link
   State Advertisement (LSA) to all routers in the area, OSPF's flooding
   algorithm transmits the LSA to its single hop away adjacent neighbor.
   The received LSA undergoes processing according to OSPF's processing
   rules and is then forwarded to OSPF neighbors further away from the
   router originating the LSA. As explained earlier the delay in
   receiving a LSA at a router is gated by the processing and forwarding
   speed of the control plane at each hop along a path from the
   originating OSPF router.

   Some applications need to send information to routers that are
   multiple hops away even though they do not have adjacency
   relationship with directly connected neighbors. In such cases the
   forwarding of application messages depends on the forwarding plane
   being setup by an underlying protocol that has established adjacent
   neighbor relationship with routers that are a single hop away. In
   scenarios where the data plane forwarding is changing due to the
   underlying protocol, the applications message forwarding speed and
   reliability is gated by the speed and mechanisms of the underlying
   protocols hop-by-hop message processing and forwarding by control-
   plane.

   A typical example of an application that could use a mechanism to
   send information to non-directly connected neighbors is IP
   FastReroute (IP-FRR). It could use a forwarding mechanism that has
   been setup by an underlying protocol to trigger (on failure) a non-
   directly connected neighbor, to switch traffic to an alternate path.
   To reliably deliver the applications message, the forwarding

   mechanism has to be resilient against failures and the changed
   topology.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Scope

   This document describes a framework for quickly delivering
   notifications from one router to one or more routers using data plane
   as the main forwarding mechanism. It also defines some solutions
   under this framework to address the needs of some specific
   applications.

4.  Requirements

   Fast notifications (henceforth referred to as FN) must be designed as
   a set of services that can satisfy the requirements of different
   control-protocol applications. FN should avoid introducing new
   protocols and should re-use existing, commonly used protocols as much
   as possible.

   Deploying FN must not introduce new encapsulation requirements for
   routers unless those encapsulations are already available in the data
   plane for those applications. Notifying multiple routers should use
   multicast whenever possible.

5.  Architecture

   A choice of protocol to realize FN must be based on the set of
   commonly deployed protocols. These protocols must preferably have
   applicability in a wide set of network architectures such as IP-
   routing, L3VPN, L2VPN etc. Also, the knowledge of the network
   topology would be particularly useful for path computation purposes.
   The logical candidate for these requirements would be a link-state
   interior gateway protocol (IGP) such as OSPF or IS-IS.

   To implement a specific FN service, a router must convey its
   capability to the set of routers that setup forwarding to one or more
   routers in that set for specific packets in a way such that data-
   plane forwarding of notifications. It must also convey its share of
   the information that is needed to implement that FN service.

   To convey this information via OSPF, an opaque LSA is used. An Opaque
   type field "FN" is defined. The type specific ID indicates a

   particular FN service. The content of the LSA is a variable list of
   TLVs that include information required to implement that FN service.
   Different FN services will have different sets of TLVs. A specific
   instance of a FN service and how an application might use it is
   specified in Appendix A.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations of the application also apply when FN service
   is used by the application. If additional security considerations
   arise due to the way in which FN is used by the application, then
   those should be resolved in the document that explains how an
   application uses FN.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to allocate a OSPF opaque type field for FN. Within that
   LSID values for different FN services will have to be allocated. Also
   a TLV type field will have to be allocated.

Appendix A: OSPF fast convergence on link-down using FN

   OSPF fast convergence is gated by how quickly the flooding algorithm
   can propagate the LSA throughout the area. This requires hop-by-hop
   processing and forwarding by control plane. If a FN service can
   transmit the link-down notification to all routers in the area then
   OSPF's fast convergence can be improved in the link-down scenario.

A.1.  OSPF procedural changes OSPF's procedures must be modified to use
   the FN service as follows. OSPF transmits a copy of the updated
   Router LSA (on link-down) using a FN service in addition to the
   normal processing and flooding done by OSPF. The destination IP
   address of the link-state update (LSU) packet is set to the one
   dictated by the FN service. If Cryptographic authentication is
   required, a shared secret key must be configured for the area. The
   Cryptographic sequence number in the LSU must be set to zero. On
   receiving a LSU via FN, the router accepts it if authentication
   succeeds. There must be no acknowledgement for such an LSU. If the
   received LSA is older than the one in the LSDB, the received LSA is
   discarded. If the received LSA is newer, the LSA is stored alongside
   the older copy and a timer T-discard-FN-LSA is started. A flag FN-
   LSA-present is used in the LSDB entry to indicate that a newer
   version of the LSA (received via FN) is present. SPF is triggered.
   During SPF, if the FN-LSA-present flag is true then the LSA received
   via FN is used instead. When a LSA is received via the flooding
   procedure of [OSPF], and is determined to be newer, it is compared
   with the LSA copy received via FN (if one exists). If the two copies
   are the same, the LSA received via FN becomes the only entry in the
   LSDB. If the two copies are different, the LSA received through the
   flooding procedure of [OSPF] becomes the only copy in the LSDB and
   SPF is triggered. In both cases the flag FN-LSA-present is cleared
   and the timer T-discard-FN-LSA is canceled. When the timer T-discard-
   FN-LSA expires, the corresponding LSA copy received via FN is
   discarded (FN-LSA-present flag is cleared) and SPF is triggered.


A.2.  FN service using spanning tree

   One way to provide the FN service for this application is as follows.
   A multicast spanning tree (with a specially allocated multicast
   destination IP address) is used to send the link-down notification
   message. The tree must be consistently computed at all routers. It
   must be computed as a shortest path tree rooted at the highest
   router-id. During tree computation only routers that are capable of
   this FN service are picked. When multiple paths are available the
   neighboring node in the graph with highest LSID is picked. When
   multiple paths are available through multiple interfaces to a
   neighboring node, a numbered interface is preferred over an

   unnumbered interface. A higher IP address is preferred among numbered
   interfaces and a higher ifIndex is preferred among unnumbered
   interfaces. Multicast forwarding state is installed using such a tree
   as a bi-directional tree. Each router on the tree can send packets to
   all other routers on that tree. Even when the topology changes such
   that the tree breaks, the link-down notification is delivered to all
   routers.
