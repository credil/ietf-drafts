         Revealing hosts sharing an IP address using TCP option
                    draft-wing-nat-reveal-option-01

Abstract

   When an IP address is shared among several subscribers, it is
   impossible to determine which subscriber has initiated that TCP
   connection.  This memo describes a technique to share the identity of
   a subscriber that initiated a TCP connection with the TCP server.
   The proposed method avoids altering the application-level payload and
   works well with SSL-protected connections.  It uses a new TCP option
   for this purpose.

Internet-Draft     Connection Identity via TCP option      February 2011


1.  Introduction

   There are several scenarios where it is valuable to know the identity
   of a TCP client, including geolocation, DoS blocking, and spam
   blacklists.  Historically, this has been done by equating IPv4
   address with 'identity'.  However, the identity of a TCP client is
   obscured when an IP address is shared I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-
   addressing-issues [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues].  IP
   address sharing is done by both network address and port translators
   (NAPT) and by application-layer proxies (e.g., HTTP or FTP proxies).

   The current state of the art requires the address sharing alter the
   application-level payload and include the identity of the internal
   host -- usually the internal host's private IP address (e.g.,
   X-Forwarded-For).  This incurs several drawbacks,

   o  adjustment of TCP sequence numbers and acknowledgement numbers for
      the duration of the TCP session

   o  risk of false-positive application matching (e.g., accidentally
      inserting an HTTP header into a non-HTTP payload).

   o  interference with application payload by increasing packet size
      (e.g., MTU)

   With SSL-protected applications (e.g., HTTP CONNECT, https) the
   current state of the art requires breaking the end-to-end encrypted
   connection.  This results in several undesirable consequences:

   o  necessity for the translator to break the end-to-end encryption,
      typically by installing an addional Certificate Authority on the
      client's CA trust list

   o  noticeable increase in the processing power required on the
      address sharing device to decrypt and re-encrypt that application
      payload

   This specification avoids the problems described above, and defines
   the method of communicating the TCP client's identity to the TCP
   server with a new TCP option to signal the internal IP address.  and
   is an alternative submission compared to [the nat-reveal].

   Some services on the Internet will react to TCP SYNs from certain IP
   addresses, such as by filtering them entirely.  This is because
   completing a 3-way handshake consumes resources and some attacks are
   intended to consume resources; once the attacking source is
   identified,  its connections attempts are ignored.  The mechanism
   proposed in this paper allows a TCP server to continue to drop those

   incoming TCP SYN messages, even if they are from a device behing a
   carrier's NAT or behind an application proxy.  Likewise, some
   services need to perform database lookups when the TCP SYN arrives or
   immediately after the 3-way handshake completes (and before
   application data arrives).  This mechanism described in this document
   allows such mechanisms to continue to function at their current speed
   and efficiency.

   This extension is necessary because IP address sharing will allow
   malicious users to connect to IPv4-capable servers.  Thus, until a
   server is only accessible via IPv6 (and inaccessible via IPv4), IPv4
   servers will suffer from the inability to identify individual TCP
   clients as discussed in I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues].


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Description

   This proposal defines one new TCP option, CX-ID, to contain the
   client's identifier -- which might be their IPv4 address, VLAN ID,
   VRF ID, subscriber ID, or first half of their IPv6 address.  The
   address sharing device (NAT, application proxy) would add the TCP
   option to the TCP SYN packet.  Up to 8 octets (64 bits) can be
   expressed.  TCP options are treated outside of the TCP sequence
   space, so no modifications of either sequence or acknowledgement
   numbers are needed.

3.1.  Operation of Address Sharing Device

   The address sharing device inserts the CX-ID option onto the TCP SYN,
   as depicted below.  If there is already an CX-ID option present, it
   is over-written with the new value.

   TCP CLIENT    proxy, NAT64, NAT44            TCP SERVER
   ----------    -------------------            ----------
       |                 |                            |
       |---TCP SYN------>|                            |

       |<--TCP SYNACK----|                            |
       |---TCP ACK------>|                            |
       |                 |---TCP ACK----------------->|

      ...               ...                          ...

3.2.  Operation of the TCP Server

   The TCP server identifies the client by combining the source IPv4
   address in the IP header with the data in the CX-ID option.  This can
   be implemented by modifying the TCP stack to record the CX-ID
   information when the TCP SYN is received, and providing that
   information to the application via an API.


4.  Option format

   With the CX-ID option, the client's 64-bit identifier is the TCP
   option payload.  This can contain the TCP client's internal IPv4
   address, or other identifier that reliably identifies that
   subscriber's traffic, such as a combination of internal VLAN ID +
   internal IPv4 address, or the IPv6 tunnel ID.


           +--------+--------+---------...-------------+
           |xxxxxxxx|00001010|   TCP client identifier |
           +--------+--------+---------...-------------+
            Kind=(to be IANA assigned)   Length=variable, up to 10

   If this option is present, it communicates the internal identity of
   the TCP which sends this segment.  This field MUST only be sent in
   the initial connection request (i.e., in segments with the SYN
   control bit set).


5.  Interaction with TCP SYN Cookies

   TCP SYN cookies are commonly deployed to mitigate TCP SYN attacks
   RFC4987 [RFC4987].  The mechanism described in this document requires
   the server store extra information which arrives on the TCP SYN,
   which increases the TCP server's attack surface.

   To mitigate this, the authors have considered sending the CX-ID on
   the first ACK packet, if the TCP server sends CX-ID in the SYNACK.


   TCP CLIENT    proxy, NAT64, NAT44            TCP SERVER
   ----------    -------------------            ----------
       |                 |                            |
       |---TCP SYN------>|                            |
       |                 |---TCP SYN, Cx-ID=1.2.3.4-->|
       |                 |<--TCP SYNACK, CX-ID=0------|
       |<--TCP SYNACK----|                            |
       |---TCP ACK------>|                            |
       |                 |---TCP ACK, CX-ID=1.2.3.4-->|
       |                 |                            |
      ...               ...                          ...

   Another idea is to use on option value with no payload (length=2), in
   the SYN, to merely indicate "I can do CX", which is echoed by a
   supporting server.  The internal identifier itself is then sent in
   the first ACK:


   TCP CLIENT    proxy, NAT64, NAT44            TCP SERVER
   ----------    -------------------            ----------
       |                 |                            |
       |---TCP SYN------>|                            |
       |                 |---TCP SYN, CX-ID, len=2----->|
       |                 |<--TCP SYNACK, CX-ID, len=2--|
       |<--TCP SYNACK----|                            |
       |---TCP ACK------>|                            |
       |                 |---TCP ACK, CX-ID=1.2.3.4-->|
       |                 |                            |
      ...               ...                          ...

   This idea is still under evaluation.


6.  Security Considerations

   The connections that happen, today, without a NAPT necessarily reveal
   the source address of the TCP client -- so this mechanism revealing
   the identity of the client should not be a concern except for the
   installations that attempt to use NAPT for "privacy" reasons.  At
   such installations, their NAPT would not implement the TCP option
   described in this document.

   An attacker might might use this functionality to appear as if IP
   address sharing is occuring, in the hopes that a naive server will

Internet-Draft     Connection Identity via TCP option      February 2011


   allow additional attack traffic.  TCP servers and applications SHOULD
   NOT assume the mere presence of the functionality described in this
   paper indicates there are other (benign) users sharing the same IP
   address.

   The addition of this TCP option will break TCP-AO RFC5925 [RFC5925],
   which provides integrity protection of the TCP SYN (including TCP
   options).  However, TCP-AO is already known to not survive address
   sharing (through a NAPT or through an application proxy).
