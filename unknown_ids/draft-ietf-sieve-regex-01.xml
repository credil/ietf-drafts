<abstract><t>
This document describes the "regex" extension to the Sieve email filtering
language. In some cases, it is desirable to have a string matching mechanism
which is more powerful than a simple exact match, a substring match or
a glob-style wildcard match.  The regular expression matching
mechanism defined in this draft provides users with much more powerful
string matching capabilities.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">

<t>
Sieve <xref target='RFC5228' /> is a language for filtering email
messages at or around the time of final delivery.  It is designed to be
implementable on either a mail client or mail server.
</t>

<t>
The Sieve base specification defines so-called match types for tests:
is, contains, and matches. An "is" test requires an exact match, a "contains"
test provides a substring match, and "matches" provides glob-style
wildcards. This document describes an extension to the Sieve language
that provides a new match type for regular expression comparisons.
</t>

<section title="Conventions used in this document" anchor="conventions">

<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>

<t>
The terms used to describe the various components of the Sieve
language are taken from Section 1.1 of <xref target='RFC5228' />.

<section title="Capability Identifier" anchor="capa">

<t>
The capability string associated with the extension defined in this
document is "regex".
</t>

<section title="Regex Match Type" anchor="matchtype">

<t>
When the regex extension is available,
commands that support matching may take the optional tagged argument 
":regex" to specify that a regular expression match should be
performed.  The ":regex" match type is subject to the same rules and
restrictions as the standard match types defined in
<xref target="RFC5228"/>.
</t>

<figure>
<preamble>The "MATCH-TYPE" syntax element defined
in <xref target="RFC5228"/> is augmented here as follows:
</preamble>

<artwork>
MATCH-TYPE  =/  ":regex"

</section>

<section title="Interaction with Sieve comparators">

<t>
In order to provide for matches between character sets and case
insensitivity, Sieve uses the comparators defined in the Internet
Application Protocol Collation Registry <xref target="RFC5228"/>.
The comparator used by a given test is specified by the :comparator
argument.
</t>

<t>
The interaction between collators and the match types defined in the
Sieve base specification is straightforward. Howeer, the nature of regular
expressions does not lend itself to this usage for the :regex match type.
</t>

<t>
A component of the definition of many collators is a normalization
operation. For example, the "i;octet" comparator employs an identity
normalization; whereas the "i;ascii-casema" normalizes all lower case ASCII
characters to upper case.
</t>

<t>
The :regex match type only uses the normalization component of the associated
comparator. This normalization operation is applied to the key-list argument to
the test; the result of that normalization becomes the target of the regular
expression comparison. The comparator has no effect on the regular expression
pattern or the underlying comparison operation.
</t>

<t>
It is an error to specify a comparator that has no associated normalization
operation in conjunction with a :regex match type.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Regular expression comparisions">

<t>
Implementations MUST support extended regular expressions (EREs) as
defined by <xref target="IEEE.1003-2.1992"/>.  Any regular expression
not defined by <xref target="IEEE.1003-2.1992"/>, as well as <xref
target="IEEE.1003-2.1992"/> basic regular expressions, word boundaries
and backreferences are not supported by this
extension. Implementations SHOULD reject regular expressions that are
unsupported by this specification as a syntax error.
</t>

<t>
The following tables provide a brief summary of the regular expressions
that MUST be supported.  This table is presented here only
as a guideline.  <xref target="IEEE.1003-2.1992"/> should be used as
the definitive reference.

<section title="Interaction with Sieve Variables" anchor="interaction">

<t>This extension is compatible with, and may be used in conjunction
with the Sieve Variables extension <xref target="RFC5229"/>.</t>

<section title="Match variables" anchor="matchvar">

<t>
A sieve interpreter which supports both "regex" and "variables",
MUST set "match variables" (as defined by <xref target="RFC5229"/>
section 3.2) whenever the ":regex" match type is used.  The list of match
variables will contain the strings corresponding to the group operators in
the regular expression.  The groups are ordered by the position of the
opening parenthesis, from left to right.  Note that in regular
expressions, expansions match as much as possible (greedy
matching).
</t>

<preamble>Example:
</preamble>

<artwork>
require ["fileinto", "regex", "variables"];

if header :regex "List-ID" "&lt;(.*)@" {
    fileinto "lists.${1}"; stop;
}

# Imagine the header
# Subject: [acme-users] [fwd] version 1.0 is out
if header :regex "Subject" "^[(.*)] (.*)$" {
    # ${1} will hold "acme-users] [fwd"
    stop;
}

<section title="Set modifier :quoteregex" anchor="setmod">

<t>A sieve interpreter which supports both "regex" and "variables",
 MUST support the optional tagged argument ":quoteregex" for use with
 the "set" action.  The ":quoteregex" modifier is subject to the same
 rules and restrictions as the standard modifiers defined in <xref
 target="RFC5229"/> section 4.</t>

<figure>
<preamble>For convenience, the "MODIFIER" syntax element defined
in <xref target="RFC5229"/> is augmented here as follows:
</preamble>

<artwork>
MODIFIER  =/  ":quoteregex"

</figure>

<t>This modifier adds the necessary quoting to ensure that the
expanded text will only match a literal occurrence if used as a
parameter to :regex.  Every character with special meaning (".", "*",
"?", etc.) is prefixed with "\" in the expansion.  This modifier has a
precedence value of 20 when used with other modifiers.</t>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>
General Sieve security considerations are discussed in <xref target="RFC5228"/>.
All of the issues described there also apply to regular expression matching.
</t>

<t>
It is easy to construct problematic regular expressions that are computationally
infeasible to evaluate. Execution of a Sieve that employs a potentially problematic
regular expression, such as "(.*)*", may cause problems ranging from
degradation of performance to and outright denial of service. Moreover,
determining the computationl complexity associated
with evaluating a given regular expression is in general an intractable problem.
</t>

<t>
For this reason, all implementations MUST take appropriate steps to limit the
impact of runaway regular expression evaluation. Implementations MAY restrict
the regular expressions users are allowed to specify. Implementations that do
not impose such restrictions SHOULD provide a means to abort evaluation of
tests using the :regex match type if the operation is taking too long.
