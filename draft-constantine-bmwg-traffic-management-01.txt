Abstract 

   This framework describes a practical methodology for benchmarking the 
   traffic management capabilities of networking devices (i.e. policing,
   shaping, etc.). The goal is to provide a repeatable test method that
   objectively compare performance of the device's traffic management
   capabilities and to specify the means to benchmark traffic management
   with representative application traffic.

Internet-Draft     Traffic Management Benchmarking         January 2013

1. Introduction

   Traffic management (i.e. policing, shaping, etc.) is an increasingly
   important component when engineering network Quality of Service (QoS)
   today.  There is currently no framework to benchmark these features
   although some standards address specific areas. This draft provides
   a framework to conduct repeatable traffic management benchmarks for
   devices and systems in a lab environment.  This benchmarking 
   framework can also be used as a test procedure to assist in the
   tuning of traffic management parameters before field deployment. In
   addition to Layer 2/3 benchmarking, Layer 4 test patterns are
   proposed by this draft in order to benchmark as close as possible to
   real end-user traffic. 

1.1. Traffic Management Overview

   In general, a device with traffic management capabilities performs
   the following functions:

   - Traffic classification: identifies traffic according to various 
    configuration rules (i.e. VLAN, DSCP, etc.) and marks this traffic 
	internally to the network device. Multiple external priorities (DSCP,
	802.1p, etc.) can map to the same priority in the device.
  - Traffic policing: limits the rate of traffic that enters a network 
    device according to the traffic classification.  If the traffic 
	exceeds the contracted limits, the traffic is either dropped or 
	remarked and sent onto to the next network device
  - Traffic Scheduling: provides traffic classification within the 
    network device by directing packets to various types of queues and
	applies a dispatching algorithm to assign the forwarding sequence 
	of packets
  - Traffic shaping: a traffic control measure of actively buffering
    and metering the output rate in an attempt to adapt bursty traffic
	to the configured limits
  - Active Queue Management (AQM): monitors the status of internal 
    queues and actively drops packets, which causes the sending hosts
	to back-off and in turn can alleviate queue congestion.

   The following diagram is a generic model of the traffic management
   capabilities within a network device.  It is not intended to
   represent all variations of manufacturer traffic management
   capabilities, but provide context to this test framework.

   (TC comment: A couple other things that a traffic management device
   must be able to perform Is Marking / Remarking / encapsulation.  I
   also think we should be looking at the performance that these types
   of functions add to the frame.)
   
1.2 DUT Lab Configuration and Testing Overview

   The following is the description of the lab set-up for the traffic
   management tests:

    +--------------+     +-------+     +----------+    +-----------+
    | Transmitting |     |       |     |          |    | Receiving |
    | Test Host    |     |       |     |          |    | Test Host |
    |              |-----| DUT   |---->| Network  |--->|           |
    |              |     |       |     | Delay    |    |           |
    |              |     |       |     | Emulator |    |           |
    |              |<----|       |<----|          |<---|           |
    |              |     |       |     |          |    |           |
    +--------------+     +-------+     +----------+    +-----------+

   As shown the test diagram, the framework supports uni-directional and
   bi-directional traffic management tests.
   
   This testing framework describes the individual tests and metrics
   for each of the following traffic management functions:
   - Policing Tests
   - Shaping Tests
   - Queue / Scheduling Tests
   - Congestion Management Tests
   
   It is important to also benchmark each function in terms of overall
   rated capacity.  This involves concurrent testing of multiple 
   interfaces with the specific traffic management function enabled, and
   doing so to the capacity limit of each interface.  
   
   For an example: a device is specified to be capable of shaping on all
   of it's egress ports.  The individual verification test would first be
   conducted to benchmark the advertised shaping function to specification.
   Then the capacity test would be executed to test the shaping function
   concurrently on all interfaces and with maximum traffic load.

   Also note that the Network Delay Emulator (NDE) should be passive in
   nature such as a fiber spool.  This is recommended to eliminate the
   potential effects that an active delay element (i.e. test impairment
   generator) may have on the test flows. In the case that a fiber spool
   is not practical due to the desired latency, an active NDE must be
   independently verified to be capable of adding the configured delay
   without loss.  In other words, the DUT would be removed and the NDE
   performance benchmarked independently.  This requirement will vary 
   from test to test on desired traffic speed and should be calibrated 
   before any test requiring delay, which can add a significant 
   additional amount of testing to each step.

3. Scope and Goals

   The scope of this work is to develop a framework for benchmarking and
   testing the traffic management capabilities of network devices in the
   lab environment.  These network devices may include but are not
   limited to:
   - Switches (including Layer 2/3 devices)
   - Routers
   - Firewalls
   - General Layer 4-7 appliances (Proxies, WAN Accelerators, etc.)

   Essentially, any network device that performs traffic management as
   defined in section 1.1 can be benchmarked or tested with this
   framework.

   Within this framework, the metrics are defined for each traffic
   management test but do not include pass / fail criterion, which is
   not within the charter of BMWG.  This framework provides the test
   methods and metrics to conduct repeatable testing, which will
   provide the means to compare advertised performance between vendors.

   As mentioned in section 1.2, this framework describes the individual
   tests and metrics for several management functions.  It is also within
   scope that this framework will benchmark each function in terms of overall
   rated capacity.  This involves concurrent testing of multiple 
   interfaces with the specific traffic management function enabled, and
   doing so to the capacity limit of each interface.
   
   However, it is not within scope of this framework to test multiple 
   traffic management functions concurrently (e.g. police on ingress and
   shape on egress ports).  The multitudes of possible combinations is
   almost unbounded and the ability to identify functional "break points"
   would be most times impossible.
   
   A goal of this framework is to define specific stateless traffic
   ("packet blasting") tests to conduct the benchmark tests and also to
   derive stateful test patterns (TCP or application layer) that can
   also be used to further benchmark the performance of applicable
   traffic management techniques such as shaping and congestion
   management techniques such as RED/WRED.  In cases where the network
   device is stateful in nature (i.e. firewall, etc.), stateful test
   pattern traffic is important to test along with UDP traffic in 
   specific test scenarios (i.e. TCP application and UDP VoIP, etc.)

   And finally, this framework will provide references to open source
   tools that can be used to provide stateless and/or stateful
   traffic generation emulation.

4. Traffic Benchmarking Metrics

   The metrics to be measured during the benchmarks are divided into two
   (2) sections: packet layer metrics used for the stateless traffic
   testing and segment layer metrics used for the stateful traffic 
   testing.

Constantine            October 19, 2013                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     Traffic Management Benchmarking         January 2013   

4.1.  Metrics for Stateless Traffic Tests

   For the stateless traffic tests, the metrics are defined at the layer
   3 packet level versus layer 2 packet level for consistency.

   Stateless traffic measurements require that sequence number and 
   time-stamp be inserted into the payload for lost packet and delay
   analyses.  This framework does not specify the packet format to carry
   sequence number of timing information.
   
   The following are the metrics to be used during the stateless traffic
   benchmarking components of the tests:

   - Burst Size Achieved (BSA): for the traffic policing and network
   queue tests, the tester will be configured to send bursts to test
   either the Committed Burst Size (CBS) or Excess Burst Size (EBS) of
   a policer or the queue / buffer size configured in the DUT.  The
   Burst Size Achieved metric is a measure of the actual burst size
   received at the egress port of the DUT with no lost packets.  As an
   example, the configured CBS of a DUT is 64KB and after the burst test,
   only a 63 KB can be achieved without packet loss.  Then 63KB is the
   BSA.

   - Lost Packets (LP): For all traffic management tests, the tester will
   transmit the test packets into the DUT ingress port and the number of
   packets received at the egress port will be measured.  The difference
   between packets transmitted into the ingress port and received at the
   egress port is the number of lost packets as measured at the egress
   port.  These packets must have unique identifiers such that only the
   test packets are measured.  RFC 4737 and RFC 2680 specify techniques
   to establish the threshold when a packet is lost versus out-of-order.

   - Out of Sequence (OOS): in additions to LF metric, the test
   packets must be monitored for sequence and the out-of-sequence (OOS)
   packets will be counted per RFC 4737 and RFC 2680.

   - Packet Delay (PD): the Packet Delay metric is the difference between
   the timestamp of the received egress port packets and the packets
   transmitted into the ingress port and specified in RFC 2285.

   - Packet Delay Variation (PDV): the Packet Delay Variation metric is
   the variation between the timestamp of the received egress port
   packets and specified in RFC 1889.

Internet-Draft     Traffic Management Benchmarking         January 2013
   
4.2. Metrics for Stateful Traffic Tests

   The stateful metrics will be based on RFC 6349 TCP metrics and will
   include:

   - TCP Test Pattern Execution Time (TTPET): RFC 6349 defined the TCP 
   Transfer Time for bulk transfers, which is simply the measured time 
   to transfer bytes across single or concurrent TCP connections. The
   TCP test patterns used in traffic management tests will be bulk
   transfer and interactive in nature; these test patterns simulate 
   delay-tolerant applications like FTP, streaming video etc. The TTPET
   will be the measure of the time for a single execution of a TCP Test
   Pattern (TTP).  Average, minimum, and maximum times will be measured.
   
   An example would be an interactive HTTP TTP which should take 5 seconds
   on a GigE network with 0.5 msec latency. During ten (10) executions of
   this TTP, the TTPER results might be: average of 6.5 seconds, minimum
   of 5.0 seconds, and maximum of 7.9 seconds.

   - TCP Efficiency: after the execution of the TCP Test Pattern, TCP
   Efficiency represents the percentage of Bytes that were not
   retransmitted.

                          Transmitted Bytes - Retransmitted Bytes

      TCP Efficiency % =  ---------------------------------------  X 100

                                   Transmitted Bytes

   Transmitted Bytes are the total number of TCP Bytes to be transmitted
   including the original and the retransmitted Bytes.

     - Buffer Delay: represents the increase in RTT during a TCP test
     versus the baseline DUT RTT (non congested, inherent latency).  RTT 
	 and the technique to measure RTT (average versus baseline) are defined
	 in RFC 6349.  Referencing RFC 6349, the average RTT is derived from 
	 the total of all measured RTTs during the actual test at every second
	 divided by the test duration in seconds.

                                         Total RTTs during transfer
         Average RTT during transfer = -----------------------------
                                        Transfer duration in seconds


                        Average RTT during Transfer - Baseline RTT
       Buffer Delay % = ------------------------------------------ X 100
                                    Baseline RTT


5. Tester Capabilities

     The testing capabilities of the traffic management test environment
     are divided into two (2) sections: stateless traffic testing and
     stateful traffic testing

Constantine                  October 19, 2013                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft     Traffic Management Benchmarking         January 2013

5.1. Stateless Test Traffic Generation

   The test set must be capable of generating traffic at up to the
   link speed of the DUT.  The test set must be calibrated to verify
   that it will not drop any packets.  The test set's inherent PD and PDV
   must also be calibrated and subtracted from the PD and PDV metrics.
   The test set must support the encapsulation to be tested such as
   VLAN, Q-in-Q, MPLS, etc.

   The open source tool "iperf" can be used to generate stateless UDP
   traffic and is discussed in Appendix A.  Since iperf is a software
   based tool, there will be performance limitations at higher link
   speeds (e.g. GigE, 10 GigE, etc.).  Careful calibration of any test
   environment using iperf is important.  At higher link speeds, it is
   recommended to select commercial hardware based packet test 
   equipment.

5.2. Stateful Test Pattern Generation

   The TCP test host will have many of the same attributes as the TCP test
   host defined in RFC 6349.  The TCP test device may be a standard
   computer or a dedicated communications test instrument. In both cases,
   it must be capable of emulating both a client and a server.

   For any test using stateful TCP test traffic, the Network Delay Emulator
   (NDE) function from the lab set-up must be used in order to provide a
   meaningful BDP.  As referenced in section 2, the target traffic rate and
   configured RTT must be verified independently using just the NDE for all
   stateful tests (to ensure the NDE can delay without loss).

   The TCP test host must be capable to generate and receive stateful TCP
   test traffic at the full link speed of the DUT.  As a general rule of
   thumb, testing TCP Throughput at rates greater than 100 Mbps may require
   high performance server hardware or dedicated hardware based test tools.

   (TC comment: You mention that a device to do rates greater than 100Mbit
    may require a high performance server.  We also need to discuss how
    window Sizes or flows impact that.)

   The TCP test host must allow adjusting both Send and Receive Socket
   Buffer sizes.  The Socket Buffers must be large enough to fill the BDP
   for bulk transfer TCP test application traffic.

   Measuring RTT and retransmissions per connection will generally require
   a dedicated communications test instrument. In the absence of
   dedicated hardware based test tools, these measurements may need to be
   conducted with packet capture tools, i.e. conduct TCP Throughput
   tests and analyze RTT and retransmissions in packet captures.

   The TCP implementation used by the test host must be specified in the
   test results (i.e. OS version, i.e. LINUX OS kernel using TCP New Reno,
   TCP options supported, etc).  In some cases, scaled down TCP
   implementations can also be used as is sometimes the case for high 
   performance, hadware-based commercial implementations.

Internet-Draft     Traffic Management Benchmarking         January 2013

   While RFC 6349 defined the means to conduct throughput tests of TCP bulk
   transfers, the traffic management framework will extend TCP test
   execution into interactive TCP application traffic.  Examples include
   email, HTTP, business applications, etc.  This interactive traffic is
   bi-directional and can be chatty.

   The test device must not only support bulk TCP transfer application
   traffic but also chatty traffic.  A valid stress test SHOULD include
   both traffic types. This is due to the non-uniform, bursty nature of 
   chatty applications versus the relatively uniform nature of bulk 
   transfers (the bulk transfer smoothly stabilizes to equilibrium state 
   under lossless conditions).

   While iperf is an excellent choice for TCP bulk transfer testing, the
   open source tool "Flowgrind" (referenced in Appendix A). Flowgrind is 
   client server based and emulates interactive applications at the TCP 
   layer.  As with any software based tool, the performance must be 
   qualified to the link speed to be tested.  Commercial test equipment
   should be considered for reliable results at higher links speeds (e.g 
   Gig, 10 GigE).

5.2.1. TCP Test Pattern Definitions

   As mentioned in the goals of this framework, techniques to define
   Layer 4 traffic test patterns will be defined to benchmark the
   traffic management technique(s) under realistic conditions.  Some
   network devices such as firewalls, will not process stateless test
   traffic which is another reason why stateful TCP test traffic must
   be used.

   An application could be fully emulated up to Layer 7, however this 
   framework proposes that stateful TCP test patterns be used in order
   to provide granular and repeatable control for the benchmarks. The 
   following diagram illustrates a simple Web Browsing application 
   (HTTP).

                   GET url

   Client      ------------------------>   Web

   Web             200 OK        100ms |

   Browser     <------------------------    Server

Internet-Draft     Traffic Management Benchmarking         January 2013


   In this example, the Client Web Browser (Client) requests a URL and
   then the Web Server delivers the web page content to the Client
   (after a Server delay of 100 msec).  This synchronous, "request /
   response" behavior is intrinsic to most TCP based applications such
   as Email (SMTP), File Transfers (FTP and SMB), Database (SQL), Web
   Applications (SOAP), etc.   The impact to the network elements is due
   to the multitudes of Clients and the variety of bursty traffic, which
   stresses network resources such as buffers, shapers, and other QoS
   management techniques.  The actual emulation of the specific
   application protocols is not required and TCP test patterns can be
   defined to mimic the application behavior.

   This framework does not specify a fixed set of TCP test patterns, but
   does provide examples in Appendix B.  There are two (2) techniques
   recommended by this framework to develop standard TCP test patterns
   for traffic management benchmarking.

   The first technique involves modeling, which have been described in 
   "3GPP2 C.R1002-0 v1.0" and describe the behavior of HTTP, FTP, and 
   WAP applications at the TCP layer.  The models have been defined 
   with various mathematical distributions for the Request/Response 
   bytes and inter-request gap times.  The Flowgrind tool (Appendix A)
   supports many of the distributions and is a good choice as long as 
   the processing limits of the server platform are taken into 
   consideration.

   The second technique is to conduct packet captures of the
   applications to test and then to statefully play the application back
   at the TCP layer.  The TCP playback includes the request byte size,
   response byte size, and inter-message gaps at both the client and the
   server.  The advantage of this method is that very realistic test
   patterns can be defined based on real world application traffic.

   Appendix B provides an overview of the modeling technique with
   Flowgrind, capture technique with TCP playback, and some
   representative application traffic that can be used with either
   techniques.

   (TC comment: In addition to application test patterns,  I'd also like 
   to see some of the standard ways mentioned like 2544 all 1's all F's 
   all 0's and the Alternating)

6. Traffic Benchmarking Methodology

   The traffic benchmarking methodology uses the test set-up from
   section 2 and metrics defined in section 4.  Each test should be run
   for a minimum test time of 5 minutes.  
   
   Each test should compare the network device's internal statistics 
   (available via command line management interface, SNMP, etc.) to the
   measured metrics defined in section 4.  This evaluates the accuracy
   of the internal traffic management counters under verification test
   conditions and capacity test conditions that are defined in each 
   subsection.

6.1. Policing Tests

   The intent of the policing tests is to verify the policer performance
   (i.e. CIR-CBS and EIR-EBS parameters). The tests will verify that the
   network device can handle the CIR with CBS and the EIR with EBS and
   will use back-back packet testing concepts from RFC 2544 (but adapted
   to burst size algorithms and terminology).  Also MEF-14,19,37 provide
   some basis for specific components of this test.
   
   The tests are divided into two (2) sections; individual policer
   function verification tests and then full capacity policing tests.
   It is important to verify the basic functionality of the individual
   policer then proceed into the fully rated capacity of the device.
   This capacity may include the number of policing policies per device
   and the number of policers simultaneously active across all ports.

6.1.1 Policer Verification Tests
   Policing tests should use stateless traffic. Stateful TCP test traffic 
   will generally be adversely affected by a policer in the absence of
   traffic shaping.  So while TCP traffic could be used, it is more
   accurate to benchmark a policer with stateless traffic.

   The policer test traffic shall follow the traffic profile as defined
   in MEF 10.2.  Specifically, the stateless traffic shall be
   transmitted at the link speed within the time interval of the
   policer.  In MEF 10.2, this time interval is defined as:

   Tc = (CBS * 8) / CIR or

   Te = (EBS * 8) / EIR

   As an example, consider a CBS of 64KB and CIR of 100 Mbps on a 1GigE
   physical link. The Tc equates to 5.12 msec and the 64KB burst should
   be transmitted into the ingress port at full GigE rate, then wait for
   5.12 msec for the next burst, etc.

   The metrics defined in section 4.1 shall be measured at the egress
   port and recorded; the primary result is to verify the BSA and that
   no packets are dropped.

Constantine                  October 19, 2013                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft     Traffic Management Benchmarking         January 2013

   In addition to verifying that the policer allows the specified CBS
   and EBS bursts to pass, the policer test must verify that the policer
   will police at the specified CBS/EBS values.

   For this portion of the test, the CBS/EBS value should be incremented
   by 1000 bytes higher than the configured CBS and that the egress port
   measurements must show that the majority of packets are dropped.

6.1.2 Policer Capacity Tests

   The intent of the capacity tests is to verify the policer performance
   in a scaled environment with multiple ingress customer policers on 
   multiple physical ports.  This test will benchmark the maximum number 
   of active policers as specified by the device manufacturer. 

   As an example, a Layer 2 switching device may specify that each of the
   32 physical ports can be policed using a pool of policing service 
   policies.  The device may carry a single customer's traffic on each 
   physical port  and a single policer is instantiated per physical port.
   Another possibility is that a single physical port may carry multiple
   customers, in which case many customer flows would be policed
   concurrently on an individual physical port.  

   The specified policing function capacity is generally expressed in
   terms of the number of policers active on each individual physical
   port as well as the number of unique policer rates that are utilized.
   For all of the capacity tests, the benchmarking methodology described 
   in Section 6.1.1 for a single policer should be applied to each of 
   the physical port policers.
   
6.1.2.1 Maximum Policers on Single Physical Port
   
   The first policer capacity test will benchmark a single physical port, 
   maximum policers on that physical port.

   Assume multiple categories of ingress policers at rates r1, r2,...rn.
   There are multiple customers on a single physical port. Each customer
   could be represented by a single tagged vlan, double tagged vlan,
   VPLS instance etc. Each customer is mapped to a different policer. Each
   of the policers can be of rates r1, r2,..., rn. Policer granularity 
   guideline (do we need ??)

   An example configuration would be
   - Y1 customers, policer rate r1
   - Y2 customers, policer rate r2
   - Y3 customers, policer rate r3
   ...
   - Yn customers, policer rate rn

   Some bandwidth on the physical port is dedicated for other traffic (non 
   customer traffic); this includes network control protocol traffic. There 
   is a separate policer for the other traffic. Typical deployments have 3 
   categories of policers; there may be some deployments with more or less
   than 3 categories of ingress policers.

Constantine                  October 19, 2013                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft     Traffic Management Benchmarking         January 2013

6.1.2.2 Single Policer on All Physical Ports

   The second policer capacity test involves a single Policer function per 
   physical port with all physical ports active. In this test, there is a 
   single policer per physical port. The policer can have one of the rates 
   r1, r2,.., rn. All the physical ports in the networking device are 
   active. 

6.1.2.3 Maximum Policers on All Physical Ports
   Finally the third policer capacity test involves a combination of the 
   first and second capacity test, namely maximum policers active per 
   physical port and all physical ports are active .

6.2. Queue and Scheduler Tests

   Queues and traffic Scheduling are closely related in that a queue's 
   priority dictates the manner in which the traffic scheduler's 
   transmits packets out of the egress port.

   Since device queues / buffers are generally an egress function, this
   test framework will discuss testing at the egress (although the
   technique can be applied to ingress side queues).

   Similar to the policing tests, the tests are divided into two  
   sections; individual queue/scheduler function verification tests and
   then full capacity tests.

6.2.1 Queue/Scheduler Verification Tests
   The various types of scheduling techniques include FIFO, Strict 
   Priority (SP), Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) along with other 
   variations.  This test framework recommends to test at a minimum
   these three techniques although it is the discretion of the tester
   to benchmark other device scheduling algorithms.

6.2.1.1 Testing Queue/Scheduler with Stateless Traffic

   A network device queue is memory based unlike a policing function,
   which is token or credit based.  However, the same concepts from
   section 6.1 can be applied to testing network device queue.

   The device's network queue should be configured to the desired size
   in KB (queue length, QL) and then stateless traffic should be
   transmitted to test this QL.

   The transmission interval (Ti) can be defined for the traffic bursts
   and is based off of the QL and Bottleneck Bandwidth (BB) of the
   egress interface.  The equation is similar to the Tc / Te time
   interval discussed in the policer section 6.1 and is as follows:

   Ti = QL * 8 / BB

   Important to note that the assumption is that the aggregate ingress
   throughput is higher than the BB or the queue test is not relevant
   since there will not be any over subscription.

Constantine                  October 19, 2013                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft     Traffic Management Benchmarking         January 2013

   The stateless traffic shall be transmitted at the link speed within
   the Ti time interval. The metrics defined in section 4.1 shall be
   measured at the egress port and recorded; the primary result is to
   verify the BSA and that no packets are dropped.
   
   The scheduling function must also be characterize during the test
   to benchmark the device's ability to schedule the queues according
   to the priority.  An example would be 2 levels of priority including
   SP and FIFI queueing.  Under flow load greater the the egress port
   speed, the higher priority packets should be transmitted without 
   drops (and also maintain low latency), while the lower priority 
   (or best effort) queue may be dropped.   

6.2.1.2 Testing Queue/Scheduler with Stateful Traffic

   To provide a more realistic benchmark and to test queues in layer 4
   devices such as firewalls, stateful traffic testing is recommended
   for the queue tests.  Stateful traffic tests will also utilize the
   Network Delay Emulator (NDE) from the network set-up configuration in
   section 2.

   The BDP of the TCP test traffic must be calibrated to the QL of the
   device queue.  Referencing RFC6349, the BDP is equal to:

   BB * RTT / 8 (in bytes)

   The NDE must be configured to an RTT value which is great enough to
   allow the BDP to be greater than QL.  An example test scenario is
   defined below:

   - Ingress link = GigE

   - Egress link = 100 Mbps (BB)

   - QL = 32KB

   RTT(min) = QL * 8 / BB and would equal 2.56 msec and the BDP = 32KB

   In this example, one (1) TCP connection with window size / SSB of
   32KB would be required to test the QL of 32KB.  This Bulk Transfer
   Test can be accomplished using iperf as described in Appendix A.

   The test metrics will be recorded per the stateful metrics defined in
   4.2, primarily the TCP Test Pattern Execution Time (TTPET), TCP
   Efficiency, and Buffer Delay.

   In addition to a Bulk Transfer Test, it is recommended to run the
   Bursty Test Pattern from appendix B at a minimum.  Other tests from
   include: Small Web Site, Email, Citrix, etc.

   The traffic is bi-directional - the same queue size is assumed for
   both directions.

Internet-Draft     Traffic Management Benchmarking         January 2013

6.2.2 Queue / Scheduler Capacity Tests
   
   The intent of these capacity tests is to verify queue/scheduler
   performance in a scaled environment with multiple queues/schedulers
   active on multiple egress physical ports. This test will benchmark
   the maximum number of queues and schedulers as specified by the 
   device manufacturer.  Each priority in the system will map to a 
   separate queue. 

6.2.2.1 Multiple Queues / Single Port Active
   
   For the first scheduler / queue capacity test, multiple queues per
   port will be tested on a single physical port. In this case,
   all the queues (typically 8) are active on a single physical port.
   Traffic from multiple ingress physical ports are directed to the 
   same egress physical port which will cause oversubscription on the
   egress physical port.

   There are many types of priority schemes and combinations of
   priorities that are managed by the scheduler. The following 
   sections specify the priority schemes that should be tested.
   
6.2.2.1.1 Strict Priority on Egress Port

   For this test, Strict Priority (SP) scheduling on the egress 
   physical port should be tested and the benchmarking methodology
   specified in section 6.2.1 should be applied here.  For a given 
   priority, each ingress physical port should get a fair share of
   the egress physical port bandwidth.

6.2.2.1.2 Strict Priority + Weighted Fair Queue (WFQ) on Egress Port
   
   For this test, Strict Priority (SP) and Weighted Fair Queue (WFQ)
   should be enabled simultaneously in the scheduler but on a single
   egress port. The benchmarking methodology specified in Section 6.2.1
   should be applied here.  Additionally, the egress port bandwidth 
   sharing among weighted queues should be proportional to the assigned 
   weights. For a given priority, each ingress physical port should get
   a fair share of the egress physical port bandwidth.

6.2.2.2 Single Queue per Port / All Ports Active

   Traffic from multiple ingress physical ports are directed to the
   same egress physical port, which will cause oversubscription on the
   egress physical port. Also, the same amount of traffic is directed 
   to each egress physical port.

   The benchmarking methodology specified in Section 6.2.1 should be
   applied here. Each ingress physical port should get a fair share of 
   the egress physical port bandwidth. Additionally, each egress 
   physical port should receive the same amount of traffic.

Constantine                  October 19, 2013                 [Page 17]

Internet-Draft     Traffic Management Benchmarking         January 2013

6.2.2.3 Multiple Queues per Port, All Ports Active
   
   Traffic from multiple ingress physical ports are directed to all
   queues of each egress physical port, which will cause 
   oversubscription on the egress physical ports. Also, the same 
   amount of traffic is directed to each egress physical port.

   The benchmarking methodology specified in Section 6.2.1 should be
   applied here. For a given priority, each ingress physical port 
   should get a fair share of the egress physical port bandwidth. 
   Additionally, each egress physical port should receive the same 
   amount of traffic.

6.3. Shaper tests

   The intent of the shaper tests is to verify the shaper performance
   parameters of shape rate (SR) and shape burst size (SBS). The tests
   will verify that the device can handle the CIR rate with CBS and
   smooth the traffic bursts to the shaper rate.

   Since device queues / buffers are generally an egress function, this
   framework will discuss testing at the egress (although the
   technique can be applied to ingress and internal queues).
   
   Similar to the policing tests, the tests are divided into two 
   sections; individual shaper function verification tests and then full
   capacity shaper tests.

6.3.1 Shaper Verification Tests
   A network device's traffic shaper will generally either shape to an
   average rate or provide settings similar to a policer (e.g. CIR
   and CBS.  In the context of a shaper, the CBS indicates the size of
   the burst that the shaper can accept within the shaping time
   interval.

   The shaping time interval depends upon whether the average method or
   CIR/CBS method is supported by the network device.  If only the
   average method is supported, then the shaping time interval (period
   at which bursts will be shaped) must be determined through
   manufacturer product specifications.

   For shapers that utilize the CIR/CBS method, the shaper time interval
   is the same as Tc for the policer which is indicated in section 6.1.

   (TC comment: We need to be able to measure PD over a shaper.  That
   should be the ms of queue depth.)

6.3.1.1 Testing Shaper with Stateless Traffic

   A traffic shaper is memory based like a queue, but with the added
   intelligence of an active shaping element. The same concepts from
   section 6.2 (Queue testing) can be applied to testing network device
   shaper.
   
Constantine                  October 19, 2013                 [Page 18]

Internet-Draft     Traffic Management Benchmarking         January 2013

   The device's traffic shaping function should be configured to the
   desired SR and SBS (for devices supporting this parameter) and then
   stateless traffic should be transmitted to test the SBS.

   The same example from section 6.1 is used with SBS of 64KB and CIR of
   100 Mbps; both ingress and egress ports are GigE. The Tc equates to
   5.12 msec and the 64KB burst should be transmitted into the ingress
   port at full GigE rate, then wait for 5.12 msec for the next burst,
   etc.

   While the ingress traffic will burst up to GigE link speed for the
   duration of the SBS burst, the egress traffic should be smoothed or
   averaged to the CIR rate on the egress interface.

   In addition to the egress metrics to be measured per section 4.1, the
   stateless shaper test shall record:

   - Average shaper rate on the egress port
   - Variation (min, max) around the shaper rate

6.3.1.2 Testing Shaper with Stateful Traffic

   To provide a more realistic benchmark and to test queues in layer 4
   devices such as firewalls, stateful traffic testing is also
   recommended for the shaper tests.  Stateful traffic tests will also
   utilize the Network Delay Emulator (NDE) from the network set-up
   configuration in section 2.

   The BDP of the TCP test traffic must be calculated as described in
   section 6.2.2. To properly stress network buffers and the traffic
   shaping function, the cumulative TCP window should exceed the BDP
   which will stress the shaper.  BDP factors of 1.1 to 1.5 are
   recommended, but the values are the discretion of the tester and
   should be documented.

   The cumulative TCP Window Sizes* (RWND at the receiving end & CWND 
   at the transmitting end) equates to:

   TCP window size* for each connection x number of connections

   * as described in section 3 of RFC6349, the SSB MUST be large 
   enough to fill the BDP

   Example, if the BDP is equal to 256 Kbytes and a connection size of
   64Kbytes is used for each connection, then it would require four (4)
   connections to fill the BDP and 5-6 connections (over subscribe the
   BDP) to stress test the traffic shaping function.

   Two types of tests are recommended: Bulk Transfer test and Bursty
   Test Pattern as documented in Appendix B at a minimum.  Other tests
   types may include: Small Web Site, Email, Citrix, etc.

Constantine                  October 19, 2013                 [Page 19]

Internet-Draft     Traffic Management Benchmarking         January 2013

   The test results will be recorded per the stateful metrics defined in
   section 4.2, primarily the TCP Test Pattern Execution Time (TTPET), 
   TCP Efficiency, and Buffer Delay.

   The traffic is bi-directional involving multiple egress ports.

   In addition to the egress metrics to be measured per section 4.2, the
   stateful shaper test shall record:

   - Average shaper rate on each egress interface
   - Variation (min, max) around the shaper rate

6.3.2 Shaper Capacity Tests
   The intent of these scalability tests is to verify shaper performance
   in a scaled environment with shapers active on multiple queues on
   multiple egress physical ports. This test will benchmark the maximum
   number of shapers as specified by the device manufacturer.

   For all of the capacity tests, the benchmarking methodology described 
   in Section 6.3.1 for a single shaper should be applied to each of the 
   physical port and/or queue shapers.

6.3.2.1 Single Queue Shaped, All Physical Ports Active
   The first shaper capacity test involves per port shaping, all physical
   ports active. Traffic from multiple ingress physical ports are directed
   to the same egress physical port and this will cause oversubscription 
   on the egress physical port. Also, the same amount of traffic is 
   directed to each egress physical port.

   The benchmarking methodology described in Section 6.3.1 should be 
   applied to each of the physical ports. Each ingress physical port 
   should get a fair share of the egress physical port bandwidth. 
   
6.3.2.2 All Queues Shaped, Single Port Active
   The second shaper capacity test is conducted with all queues actively
   shaping on a single physical port. The benchmarking methodology
   described in per port shaping test (previous section) serves as the 
   foundation for this. Additionally, each of the SP queues on the 
   egress physical port is configured with a shaper. For the highest 
   priority queue, the maximum amount of bandwidth available is limited 
   by the bandwidth of the shaper. For the lower priority queues, the 
   maximum amount of bandwidth available is limited by the bandwidth of
   the shaper and traffic in higher priority queues.

6.3.2.3 All Queues Shaped, All Ports Active
   And for the third shaper capacity test (which is a combination of the
   tests in the previous two sections),all queues will be actively 
   shaping and all physical ports active.

Internet-Draft     Traffic Management Benchmarking         January 2013

6.4. Congestion Management tests

   The intent of the congestion management tests is to benchmark the
   performance of various active queue management (AQM) discard
   techniques such as RED, WRED, etc.  AQM techniques vary, but the
   main goal is to discard traffic before the queue overflows as is the
   case for a FIFO queue.  This discard in effect sends implicit 
   congestion notification warning to protocols such as TCP, which 
   causes TCP to back-off and ideally improves aggregate throughput 
   by preventing global TCP session loss(tail drop).

   Similar to the policing tests, the tests are divided into two (2) 
   sections; individual AQM function verification tests and then full
   capacity AQM tests.
   
6.4.1 Congestion Management Verification Tests
   The key parameter for AQM techniques is the discard threshold of the
   queue. (RK comment: The discard is also probabilistic
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_early_detection).  In some
   network devices, this discard threshold is discretely configurable
   (e.g. percent of queue depth) and in others the discard threshold is
   intrinsic to the AQM technique itself.

   As such AQM benchmark testing may involve a certain level of
   characterization experiments in which the burst size transmitted may
   increase as a portion of the queue depth.

6.4.1.1. Testing Congestion Management with Stateless Traffic
   If the queue discard threshold is discreetly configurable, then the
   stateless burst techniques described in sections 6.2.1 (queuing
   tests) can be applied directly to the AQM tests.  In other words, the
   queue will be over-subscribed and burst transmitted into the device
   within the Ti interval as defined in 6.2.1

   For AQM techniques where the discard threshold is not discreetly
   configurable, then a stair case ramp is recommended to characterize
   and compare the AQM technique between devices.  For example if the QL
   = 32KB, then it would be reasonable to test with burst sizes in
   increments of 25% to include 8KB, 16KB, 32KB and record the results
   per section 4.2.  (RK comment: We should send a burst and examine if
   there are discontinuous drops - in the case of tail drop, the drops

6.4.1.2 Testing Congestion Management with Stateful Traffic
   Similar to the Queue tests (section 6.2) and Shaper tests (section
   6.3), stateful traffic tests will utilize the Network Delay Emulator
   (NDE) to add RTT.  The RTT should be configured such that BDP would
   equal at least 64KB.

   The key metric to be measured for the stateful tests is the TCP Test
   Pattern Execution Time (TTPET).  AQM is intended to improve TCP
   performance by preventing tail-drop and it is the TTPET that provides
   the appropriate metric to compare the AQM techniques between vendors.

   An example is as follows: transmit n TCP flows using the AQM Test
   Pattern (reference Appendix B) and measure the TTPET with and without
   AQM enabled.  The number of flows should be configured to exceed the
   BDP with recommended oversubscription within the 1.1 - 1.5 range.

   The test results will be recorded per the stateful metrics defined in
   4.2, primarily the TCP Test Pattern Execution Time (TTPET), TCP
   Efficiency, and Buffer Delay.

Appendix A: Open Source Tools for Traffic Management Testing

   This framework specifies that stateless and stateful behaviors should
   both be tested.  Two (2) open source tools that can be used are iperf
   and Flowgrind to accomplish many of the tests proposed in this 
   framework.

   Iperf can generate UDP or TCP based traffic; a client and server must
   both run the iperf software in the same traffic mode.  The server is
   set up to listen and then the test traffic is controlled from the
   client.  Both uni-directional and bi-directional concurrent testing
   are supported.

   The UDP mode can be used for the stateless traffic testing.  The
   target bandwidth, packet size, UDP port, and test duration can be
   controlled.  A report of bytes transmitted, packets lost, and delay
   variation are provided by the iperf receiver.

   The TCP mode can be used for stateful traffic testing to test bulk
   transfer traffic.  The TCP Window size (which is actually the SSB),
   the number of connections, the packet size, TCP port and the test
   duration can be controlled.  A report of bytes transmitted and
   throughput achieved are provided by the iperf sender.

   Flowgrind is a distributed network performance measurement tool.
   Using the flowgrind controller, tests can be setup between hosts
   running flowgrind.  For the purposes of this traffic management
   testing framework, the key benefit of Flowgrind is that it can
   emulate non-bulk transfer applications such as HTTP, Email, etc.
   This is due to fact that Flowgrind supports the concept of request
   and response behavior while iperf does not.

   Traffic generation options include the request size, response size,
   inter-request gap, and response time gap.  Additionally, various
   distribution types are supported including constant, normal,
   exponential, pareto, etc.  These powerful traffic generation
   parameters facilitate the modeling of complex application test
   patterns at the TCP layer which are discussed in Appendix B.

   Since these tools are software based, the host hardware must be
   qualified to be capable of generating the target traffic loads
   without packet loss and within the packet delay variation threshold.

Appendix B: Stateful TCP Test Patterns

   This framework does not specify a fixed set of TCP test patterns, but
   proposes two (2) techniques to specify repeatable TCP test patterns 
   for traffic management benchmarking and provides examples of the
   following test patterns:

   - Bulk: generate concurrent TCP connections whose aggregate
   number of in-flight data bytes would fill the BDP.  Guidelines
   from RFC 6349 are used to create this traffic model.

   - Bursty: generate precise burst patterns within a single or multiple
   TCP session(s).  The idea is for TCP to establish equilibrium and then
   burst application bytes at defined sizes.

   - AQM: generate various burst sizes within a TCP session, spacing
   the bursts apart such that burst size achieved (BSA) can be easily 
   determined.  In a sense, this could be considered a TCP stair case or
   ramp test.

   - Small Web Site: mimic the request and response (chatty) and bulk
   transfer (page download) behavior of a less complex web site.  This
   example uses the modeling technique from Flowgrind to generate this
   TCP test pattern.

   - Cirix: mimic chatty behavior of Citrix.  This example uses the
   packet capture technique to model the behavior and discusses the
   requirements for test tools to playback the packet capture
   statefully.

   TBD: Detailed definitions for each of the test patterns listed above.
