    <abstract>
      <t>Most Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandate
      the use of the Control Word (CW) in order to better emulate the services
      for which the encapsulations have been defined. However, some
      encapulations treat the Control Word as optional. As a result,
      implementations of the CW, for encapsulations for which it is optional,
      vary by equipment manufacturer, equipment model and service provider
      network. Similarly, Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)
      supports three Control Channel (CC) types and multiple Connectivity
      Verification (CV) Types. This flexibility has led to reports of
      interoperability issues within deployed networks and associated drafts
      to attempt to remedy the situation. This survey of the PW/VCCV user
      community was conducted to determine implementation trends. The survey
      and results is presented herein.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The PWE3 working group has defined many encapsulations of various
      Layer 1 and Layer 2 links. Within these encapsulations, there are often
      several modes of encapsulation which have differing requirements in
      order to fully emulate the service. As such, the use of the PWE3 Control
      Word is mandated in many of the encapsulations, but not all. This can
      present interoperability issues related to A) Control Word use and B)
      VCCV Control Channel negotiation in mixed implementation
      environments.</t>

      <t>The encapsulations and modes for which the Control Word is currently
      optional are: <list style="symbols">
          <t>Ethernet Tagged Mode</t>

          <t>Ethernet Raw Mode</t>

          <t>PPP</t>

          <t>HDLC</t>

          <t>Frame Relay Port Mode</t>

          <t>ATM (N:1 Cell Mode)</t>
        </list> <xref target="RFC5085"></xref> defines three Control Channel
      types for MPLS PW's: Type 1, using the Pseudowire Control Word, Type 2,
      using the Router Alert Label, and Type 3, using TTL Expiration (e.g.
      MPLS PW Label with TTL == 1). While Type 2 (RA Label) is indicated as
      being "the preferred mode of VCCV operation when the Control Word is not
      present," RFC 5085 does not indicate a mandatory Control Channel to
      ensure interoperable implementations. The closest it comes to mandating
      a control channel is the requirement to support Type 1 (Control Word)
      whenever the control word is present. As such, the three options yield
      seven implementation permutations (assuming you have to support at least
      one Control Channel type to provide VCCV). Due to these permuations,
      interoperability challenges have been identified by several VCCV
      users.</t>

      <t>In order to assess the best approach to address the observed
      interoperability issues, the PWE3 working group decided to solicit
      feedback from the PW and VCCV user community regarding implementation.
      This document presents the survey and the information returned by the
      user community who participated.</t>

      <section title="PW/VCCV Survey Overview">
        <t>Per the direction of the PWE3 Working Group chairs, a survey was
        created to sample the nature of implementations of Pseudowires, with
        specific emphasis on Control Word usage, and VCCV, with emphasis on
        Control Channel and Control Type usage. The survey consisted of a
        series of questions based on direction of the WG chairs and the survey
        opened to the public on November 4, 2010. The URL for the survey (now
        closed) was http://www.surveymonkey.com/pwe3/. The survey ran from
        November 4, 2010 until February 25, 2011.</t>

      <section title="Open Ended Question">
        <t>Space was provided for user feedback. The following instructions
        were given: "Please use this space to provide any feedback regarding
        PW and VCCV deployments, VCCV interoperability challenges, this survey
        or any network/vendor details you wish to share." Below are the
        responses, made anonymous.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>BFD VCCV Control Channel is not indicated in the survey (may be
            required for PW redundancy purpose)</t>

            <t>Using CV is not required at the moment</t>

            <t>COMPANY has deployed several MPLS network elements, from
            multiple vendors. COMPANY is seeking a uniform implementation of
            VCCV Control Channel (CC) capabilities across its various vendor
            platforms. This will provide COMPANY with significant advantages
            in reduced operational overheads when handling cross-domain
            faults. Having a uniform VCCV feature implementation in COMPANY
            multi-vendor network leads to: &bull; Reduced operational cost and
            complexity &bull; Reduced OSS development to coordinate
            incompatible VCCV implementations. &bull; Increased end-end
            service availability when handing faults. In addition, currently
            some of COMPANY deployed VCCV traffic flows (on some vendor
            platforms) are not guaranteed to follow those of the
            customer&rsquo;s application traffic (a key operational
            requirement). As a result, the response from the circuit ping
            cannot faithfully reflect the status of the circuit. This leads to
            ambiguity regarding the operational status of our networks. An
            in-band method is highly preferred, with COMPANY having a clear
            preference for VCCV Circuit Ping using PWE Control Word. This
            preference is being pursued with each of COMPANY vendors.</t>

            <t>PW VCCV is very useful tool for finding faults in each PW
            channel. Without this we can not find fault on a PW channel. PW
            VCCV using BFD is another better option. Introperbility challences
            are with Ethernet OAM mechanism.</t>

            <t>We are using L2PVPN AToM like-to-like models - ATMoMPLS -
            EoMPLS ATMoMPLS : This service offered for transporting ATM cells
            over IP/MPLS core with Edge ATM CE devices including BPX, Ericsson
            Media Gateway etc. This is purely a Port mode with cell-packing
            configuration on it to have best performance. QoS marking is done
            for getting LLQ treatment in the core for these MPLS encapsulated
            ATM packets. EoMPLS: This service offered for transporting 2G/3G
            traffic from network such as Node-B to RNC's over IP/MPLS backbone
            core network. QoS marking is done for getting guaranteed bandwidth
            treatment in the core for these MPLS encapsulated ATM packets. In
            addition to basic L2VPN service configuration, these traffic are
            routed via MPLS TE tunnels with dedicated path and bandwidth
            defined to avoid bandwidth related congestion.</t>

            <t>EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER does not provide options to configure
            VCCV control-channel and its sub options for LDP based L2Circuits.
            How can we achieve end-to-end management and fault detection of PW
            without VCCV in such cases?</t>

            <t>I'm very interested in this work as we continue to experience
            interop challenges particularly with newer vendors to the space
            who are only implementing VCCV via control word. Vendors who have
            tailed their MPLS OAM set specifically to the cell backhaul space
            and mandatory CW have been known to fall into this space. That's
            all I've got.</t>

        <t>We are using L2PVPN AToM like-to-like models - ATMoMPLS - EoMPLS
        ATMoMPLS : This service offered for transporting ATM cells over
        IP/MPLS core with Edge ATM CE devices including BPX, Ericsson Media
        Gateway etc. This is purely a Port mode with cell-packing
        configuration on it to have best performance. QoS marking is done for
        getting LLQ treatment in the core for these MPLS encapsulated ATM
        packets. EoMPLS: This service offered for transporting 2G/3G traffic
        from network such as Node-B to RNC's over IP/MPLS backbone core
        network. QoS marking is done for getting guaranteed bandwidth
        treatment in the core for these MPLS encapsulated ATM packets. In
        addition to basic L2VPN service configuration, these traffic are
        routed via MPLS TE tunnels with dedicated path and bandwidth defined
        to avoid bandwidth related congestion.</t>

        <t>PW VCCV is very useful tool for finding faults in each PW channel.
        Without this we can not find fault on a PW channel. PW VCCV using BFD

        <t>COMPANY has deployed several MPLS network elements, from multiple
        vendors. COMPANY is seeking a uniform implementation of VCCV Control
        Channel (CC) capabilities across its various vendor platforms. This
        will provide COMPANY with significant advantages in reduced
        operational overheads when handling cross-domain faults. Having a
        uniform VCCV feature implementation in COMPANY multi-vendor network
        leads to: &bull; Reduced operational cost and complexity &bull;
        Reduced OSS development to coordinate incompatible VCCV
        implementations. &bull; Increased end-end service availability when
        handing faults. In addition, currently some of COMPANY deployed VCCV
        traffic flows (on some vendor platforms) are not guaranteed to follow
        those of the customer&rsquo;s application traffic (a key operational
        requirement). As a result, the response from the circuit ping cannot
        faithfully reflect the status of the circuit. This leads to ambiguity
        regarding the operational status of our networks. An in-band method is
        highly preferred, with COMPANY having a clear preference for VCCV
        Circuit Ping using PWE Control Word. This preference is being pursued
        with each of COMPANY vendors.</t>
