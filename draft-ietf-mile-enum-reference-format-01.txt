Abstract

   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format [IODEF] provides a
   Reference class used to reference external entities (such as
   enumeration identifiers).  However, the method of external entity
   identification has been left unstructured.  This document describes a
   method to provide structure for referencing external entities for the
   [IODEF] Reference class.

INTERNET DRAFT     IODEF Enumeration Reference Format      July 15, 2013


1  Introduction

   There is an identified need to specify a format to include relevant
   enumeration values in an IODEF document.  It is anticipated that this
   requirement will exist in other standardization efforts within
   several IETF Working Groups, but the scope of this document pertains
   solely to [IODEF].

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Referencing External Enumerations

   The need is to place enumeration identifiers and their references in
   [IODEF]'s Reference class.  There are several ways to accomplish this
   goal, but the most appropriate at this point is to require a specific
   format for the ReferenceName string of the [IODEF] Reference class,
   such that an IANA table can be used to catalog a variety of reference
   types.

      +------------------+
      | Reference        |
      +------------------+
      |                  |<>----------[ ReferenceName ]
      |                  |<>--{0..*}--[ URL           ]
      |                  |<>--{0..*}--[ Description   ]
      +------------------+

                   FIGURE 1: [IODEF] Reference Class 

   Per [IODEF] the ReferenceName is of type ML_STRING.  This becomes
   problematic when specific references, especially enumerations such as
   [CVE], [CCE], [CPE] and so on, are referenced - how is an implementer
   to know which type of reference this is, and thus how to parse it?
   One solution, presented here, is to require that ReferenceName follow
   a particular format. 

 2.1 Reference Name Format

   The Reference Name Format uses XML to provide the structure for
   enumeration identification, and requires that a specific Abbreviation
   and RegistryVersion be associated with the ID. An implementer can
   look up the ID type (as referenced by the logical tuple of
   Abbreviation and RegistryVersion) in the IANA table (see Section 4)

   to understand how the ID is structured.

      <Reference>
         <ReferenceName>
            <EnumRef>
               <Abbreviation>CXI</Abbreviation>
               <RegistryVersion>1</RegistryVersion>
               <ID>CXI-1234-XYZ</ID>
            </EnumRef>
         </ReferenceName>
         <URL>http://cxi.example.com</URL>
         <Description>Foo</Description>
      </Reference>

   Information in the IANA table (see Section 4) would include:

      Full Name: Concept X Identifier
      Abbreviation: CXI
      Registry Version: 1
      Enumeration Version: any
      Specification URI: http://cxi.example.com/spec_url

 2.3 Reference Method Applicability

      While the scope of this document pertains to [IODEF], it should be
      readily apparent that any standard needing to reference an
      enumeration identified by a specially formatted string can use
      this method of providing structure after the standard has been
      published.  In effect, this method provides a standardized
      interface for enumerations, thus allowing a loose coupling between
      a given standard and the enumeration identifiers it needs to
      reference now and in the future.

3  Security Considerations

      None.


4  IANA Considerations

      This document specifies an identifier format for the [IODEF]
      ReferenceName string of the Reference class.

      This memo creates the following registry for IANA to manage:

      Name of the Registry: "Enumeration Reference Type Identifiers"

      Note that certain name requests should not be permitted as either
      Full Name or Abbreviation entries for the requested IANA table. 

      Fields to record in the registry: 

         Full Name: The full name of the enumeration as a string from
         the ASCII character set.

         Abbreviation: The abbreviation of the enumeration as a string
         from the ASCII character set.  An abbreviation may be an
         initialism or acronym, is free-form, but is limited to between
         two and ten upper-case characters (used to avoid case-specific
         mismatch errors) meeting the regular expression (between the
         quotes; Perl Regular Expressions): ^[A-Z]{2,20}$ 

         Registry Version: The IANA-registry-specific version to which
         an enumeration identifier pertains as an integer greater than
         zero.  The Registry Version is intended to be incremented for
         each new entry, which permits any string representation for the
         Enumeration Version, but explicitly structures enumeration ID
         versions for the purpose of the registry.

         Enumeration Version: The version of the enumeration as a free-
         form string from the ASCII character set.  

         Specification URI: A list of one or more URIs [RFC3986] from
         which the registered specification can be obtained.  The
         registered specification MUST be readily and publicly available
         from that URI.

      Initial registry contents: None.

      Allocation Policy: Expert Review [RFC5226] and Specification
      Required [RFC5226]

   The Designated Expert is expected to consult with the MILE (Managed
   Incident Lightweight Exchange) working group or its successor if any
   such WG exists (e.g., via email to the working group's mailing list).
   The Designated Expert is expected to review the request and validate
   the appropriateness of the enumeration for the attribute.  If a
   specification is associated with the request, it MUST be reviewed by
   the Designated Expert.

   The Designated Expert will need to ensure the Full Name or
   Abbreviation entry under consideration is appropriate for the problem
   domain and that information at the Specification URI is sufficient
   for unambiguously parsing the identifier. The Designated Expert
   should also validate that the next appropriate Registry Version is
   being used for a new registration. Additionally, the Designated
   Expert should prefer short Abbreviations over long ones.
