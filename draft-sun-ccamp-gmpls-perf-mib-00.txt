     Label Switched Path (LSP) Provisioning Performance Management
    Information Base for Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) / MPLS-TE networks
                 draft-sun-ccamp-gmpls-perf-mib-00.txt

Abstract

   This memo defines Management Information Bases (MIBs) for
   performances of provisioning Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in
   Generalized MPLS or MPLS-TE networks.

   When Generalized MPLS/MPLS-TE is used to provision LSPs, it is useful
   to record the performance of the provisioning process, such as the
   delay in creating and deleting the LSPs.  The managed information may
   be retrieved by the Management System and visualized on the GUI, so
   that the performance of dynamic provisioning may be monitored in a
   timely manner.

   This work is a continuation of the work in [RFC5814] and
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-dpm], where the provisioning performance values are
   obtained through active measurements.

Internet-Draft             LSP Performance MIB                 July 2011


1.  Introduction

   When Label Switched Paths (LSPs) are provisioned dynamically within
   an operational network, it is helpful to monitor and record the
   related performance information, such as the experienced provisioning
   delay and error events.  Such information may help operators to
   ensure correct operation of dynamic LSP provisioning in their
   network, or possibly identify performance degradation in the control
   plane.

   This memo defines a set of objects that can reveal the performance of
   an operational network in terms of dynamic LSP provisioning.  It is
   intended to complement the performance objects, such as the number of
   packets received and sent, per LSP tunnel, in [RFC3812] and
   [RFC4802].

   Unlike the work in [RFC5814] and [I-D.ietf-ccamp-dpm], where the
   performance values are obtained through active measurements, this
   document focuses on the performance values in operational
   environments.  The actual value of the performance in this document
   is recorded only when an LSP is provisioned, and is thus collected
   passively.  Hence such information reflects only the performance at
   specific and discrete times.  However, when properly used, they can
   be helpful in identifying performance degradation, or even
   malfunctioning, in the network control plane.

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578[RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579[RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
   2580[RFC2580].

4.  Brief Description of LSP performance MIB Objects

4.1.  gmplsPerfMaxEntries

   Defines the maximum number of rows stored in the gmplsPerfTable.  An
   implementation MUST start assigning gmplsPerfEntryIndex values at 1
   and wrap after exceeding the maximum possible value, as defined by
   the limit of this object.

4.2.  gmplsPerfTunnelConfigured

   Defines the The total number of tunnels configured.

4.3.  gmplsPerfTable

   The performance of past LSP provisioning process is stored in this
   table.  To handle possible provisioning failures, start and complete
   timestamp of a provisioning operation is recorded.  For example, for
   LSP creation process, the timestamps of creation initiation and
   completion are recorded seperatly.  It is up to the users to
   determine the actual performance value, or identify a possible
   creation/deletion failure.  The maximum number of entries stored in
   this table is determined by the value of gmplsPerfMaxEntries.

            "Defines a table for storing the results of LSP
            provisioning operations. It allows the provisioning
            performance be retrieved later for monitoring or
            diagnostic purposes. The recorded performance information
            is intended to complement the existing performance
            statistics in the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB and GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB.

            Note that the creation and tear-down operation performances
            are stored in one table, ie., gmplsPerfTable. When an LSP
            tunnel creation operation is  initiated, an entry MUST be
            added in this table and Tunnel ID as well as the time of
            initiation MUST be recorded. Upon completion of the creation
            process, ie., a positive signaling feedback is received by
            the ingress LSR,  this complete time object in this entry
            MUST be updated.

            When an LSP tunnel deletion process is initiated, the
            corresponding entry with the same tunnel ID MUST be located
            and updated with time of the deletion initiation time. When
            the deletion operation is complete, the entry MUST again

            be updated with the completion time.

            Under circumstances that the creation or deletion operation
            may fail, an entry may be partially updated. Eg., when a
            creation operation timeouts without a positive signaling
            feedback, the creation completion time may never be updated.
            When a tear-down operation is caused by nodes other than the
            Ingress LSR, the tear-down start time may not be known to
            the ingress LSR. In such cases, the user of the MIB MUST be
            aware of such events and treat the performance information
            accordingly.

            The number of entries in this table is limited by the value
            of the corresponding gmplsPerfMaxEntries object. An
            implementation MUST start assigning gmplsPerfEntryIndex at
            1 and wrap after exceeding the maximum possible value, as
            defined by the limit of gmplsPerfMaxEntries. An
            implementation of this MIB will remove the oldest entry
            in the gmplsPerfTable to allow the addition of a new entry
