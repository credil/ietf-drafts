Abstract

   Identity Management System plays an important role in Cloud
   Computing. A good Identity Management System should meet the diverse
   security requirements from both service providers and users, improve
   usability for users and protect the resources from unauthorized
   access. The goal of the document is to document the improvement of
   Identity Management System to provide users a friendly experience
   through the use of technologies based on the ABFAB architecture and
   specifications.

1. Introduction

   Generally speaking, the higher the level of assurance for
   authentication is, the safer the communication between principals.
   However, it will compromise the usability and feasibility. Therefore
   to differentiate the assurance for authentication can obtain a
   balance between usability and strength of authentication. In
   addition, different identity providers may use different
   authentication protocols, so it can promote service providers to
   recognize identity providers to use different authentication
   protocols by classify the security strength of authentication
   protocols. In cloud computing, there are all kinds of services which
   need different authentication mechanisms. So identity management
   system with differentiated levels of assurance for authentication is
   extremely reasonable and strong needed in cloud environment.

Internet-Draft             ABFAB Use Cases              September 2013


   In federated identity management, identity attributes may be
   distributed in different attribute servers that trustworthiness of
   attributes is different and furthermore the service provider needs
   attributes to grant users. However the service provider's desired
   attributes vary based on business requirements. So classifying the
   level of assurance for attributes is beneficial to improve the
   security of service distribution.

   Furthermore the identity provider, attribute service provider and
   service provider are typically independent parties, it is necessary
   to standardize the levels of assurance for both authentication and
   attributes to achieve interoperation.

   This document enumerates some of these uses cases, describing how
   technologies based on the ABFAB architecture [I-D.ietf-abfab-arch]
   and specifications could be used.

2. Context of Use Cases

   The use cases described in this document are a result of work led by
   Jianyong Chen, the professor of Shenzhen University and research the
   security of network, responding to requirements from its community,
   and augmented by various inputs from the IETF community.

   The ABFAB architecture and specifications enables authentication and
   authorization to occur across organizational boundaries. For many
   applications, principals need not have pre-instantiated accounts
   that their federated identity maps to before their first visit to
   that application; the application can perform this process on the
   fly. In cases where such accounts are required for particular
   applications, the pre-provisioning process is out of scope of ABFAB
   technologies, which assumes any such requirements have already been
   fulfilled. Standards-based work of note that would assist with this
   pre-provisioning of accounts includes the standards and
   specifications produced by the IETF SCIM working group.

3. Use Cases

   This section describes some of the variety of potential use cases
   where technologies based on the ABFAB architecture and
   specifications could help improve the user experience; each includes
   a brief description of how current technologies attempt to solve the
   use cases and how this could be improved upon by ABFAB
   implementations.

Internet-Draft             ABFAB Use Cases              September 2013


3.1. Level of Assurance for Authentication

   Level of assurance for authentication describes the security
   strength of authentication. It represents the security strength of
   the way to authenticate, such as single-factor authentication or
   multi-factor authentication, in-person identity proofing or online
   identity proofing and so on.

   With differentiated level of assurance for authentication, services
   can provide users diverse authentication services without
   compromising the usability. For instance, when a user connects to a
   target service via public free Wi-Fi, in response to higher security
   threats, it needs to sacrifice the usability and use higher level
   assurance for authentication such as Two-factor authentication
   mechanism. However, if using the cellular network, it can use lower
   level of assurance for authentication such as password
   authentication mechanism so that can improve the user experience.

   At present, it already has some protocols to support multiple
   authentication mechanisms. For instance, in the Simple and Protected
   GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO) [RFC2478], the initiator
   propose one security mechanism or an ordered list of security
   mechanisms, the target then make a decision depend on the proposed
   security mechanism (list) by negotiating with the initiator. Though
   these mechanism protocols can satisfy the requirement, the
   scalability is not good.

   The use of ABFAB technologies in this case via the EAP framework
   would enable identity providers provide many flexible authentication
   mechanism including the simple and the complex, which would meet the
   service providers' diverse requirements and it also has a
   scalability to support more authentication mechanisms.

3.2. Level of Assurance for Attribute

   Attribute service is a fine-grained service in identity management.
   Identity attributes are used to assist service providers to make
   fine-grained authorization. But as in the real world, the identity
   attribute information may be not true and fabricated. When granting
   access protected resources, some services may do not make a
   mandatory requirement on the trustworthiness of information. For
   example, when an authenticated person want to buy a bottle of wine
   in online store, the store need to certify the attribute value of
   age exceed 18. But if he wants to play game online, he may not be
   required to be an adult. So a classified level of assurance for
   attributes can enable service providers to authorize appropriate
   protected resources to users. when the level of assurance for

   attributes could not match the required from the service providers,
   the service providers can give a Denial of Service to the users so
   that it can prevent unauthorized or illegal accesses to the
   protected important resources.

   At present, there are many application protocols support identity
   attributes exchange between SPs and attribute servers or IdPs. They
   provide SPs with all the required attribute information to make
   authorization decision such as SAML [OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os]
   which support arbitrary set of attributes transportation within SAML
   assertions.

   Federated identity management via ABFAB technologies would enhance
   the user experience of accessing different protected resources
   hosted in servers as well as protect resources from unauthorized
   access. The Authentication, Authorization and Accounting framework
   of ABFAB architecture provides transport for attributes. The AAA
   framework already has an extensible architecture allowing for new
   attributes to be defined and transported. With the AAA framework in
   this case context, we can define the levels of assurance for users'
   identity attributes, and transport them to the service provider then
   the SP can determine whether the users can get authorization of
   resources or not according to them.

   This document contains only use cases and defines no protocol
   operations for ABFAB. Security considerations for the ABFAB
   architecture are documented in the ABFAB architecture specification,
   and security considerations for ABFAB technologies and protocols
