               Update Notifications for Proxy Mobile IPv6
             draft-krishnan-netext-update-notifications-01

Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network based mobility management
   protocol that enables IP mobility for a host without requiring its
   participation in any mobility-related signaling.  This document
   proposes a mechanism for the Local Mobility Anchor to asynchronously
   notify the Mobile Access Gateway about changes related to the
   mobility session.

Internet-Draft         PMIPv6 Update Notifications          October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] describes the protocol operations to
   maintain reachability and session persistence for a Mobile Node (MN)
   without the explicit participation from the MN in signaling
   operations at the Internet Protocol (IP) layer.  In order to
   facilitate such network-based mobility, the PMIPv6 protocol defines a
   Mobile Access Gateway (MAG), which acts as a proxy for the Mobile
   IPv6 [RFC6275] signaling, and the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) which
   acts similar to a Home Agent.  The setup of the mobility session is
   initiated by the MAG by sending a PBU message and confirmed by the
   LMA in the PBA message.  Once the mobility session is set up for a
   given lifetime, the LMA has no mechanism to inform the MAG about
   changes to the mobility session or any parameters related to the
   mobility session.

   One such scenario where such a mechanism is needed is when the LMA
   wants to inform the MAG that it needs to reregister.  It is possible
   to achieve a similar effect by using a much shorter lifetime for the
   mobility sessions but in several networks this results in an
   unacceptable, and mostly unnecessary, increase in the signaling load
   and overhead.

   This document defines a new mobility header message for performing
   notifications and a corresponding mobility header message for the MAG
   to acknowledge the notification.  While it is possible to use an
   existing mobility header type for this purpose, for instance the
   PMIPv6 Heartbeat message [RFC5847], the existing messahes do not
   provide the required semantics. e.g.  The Heartbeat message does not
   provide a reason why it was sent.


2.  Example use case

   Consider an use case where an LMA (rfLMA) wants to move over one or
   more mobility sessions from a given MAG to a different LMA (r2LMA)
   using [RFC6463]. e.g.  In order to allow planned maintenance.  The
   LMA could send an update notification to the MAG to force a re-
   registration for one or more MNs.  The MAG tries to register and gets
   a redirect from the rfLMA towards the r2LMA.

3.  LMA Behavior

   The LMA sends the Update Notification message in response to a
   condition that is specified in the Notification Reason field.  If the
   LMA requires an acknowledgement from the MAG concerning the UPN
   message, it MUST set the A bit to 1.  If not it MUST set the A bit to
   0.  The LMA MAY retransmit the UPN messages if reliability is
   required for the specific Notification reason.  If the UPN message is
   retransmitted, the LMA MUST reuse the same sequence number as the
   original message.  If the LMA receives an UPA message with a failure
   Status (Status value >127) it SHOULD log an error.


4.  MAG Behavior

   If a received Update Notification message has the A bit set to 1, the
   MAG MUST create and transmit an Update Notification Acknowledgement
   message in response to the UPN message.  The sequence number of the
   UPA message MUST be copied from the UPN message that is being
   responded to.  Depending on whether the message was processed
   successfully or not, the MAG MUST set the Status value in the UPA
   message to an appropriate value.  The actual processing required on
   the MAG is out of the scope of this document and will be specified
   for each Notification reason.

5.  Message Formats

5.1.  Update Notification(UPN)

   The LMA sends an UPN message to a MAG to notify the MAG that some
   information regarding the mobility session or parameters related to
   the mobility session has changed.

      Sequence Number: A monotonically increasing integer.  Set by the
      LMA and retained for retransmissions.

      Acknowledgement Requested (A): If this bit is set, the MAG MUST
      send an UPA message in response to the received UPN message.

      Notification Reason: Contains the code corresponding to the reason
      that caused the LMA to send the Update Notification to the MAG.
      This field does not contain any structure and MUST be treated as
      an enumeration.

      Mobility Options: Contains a set of mobility options for the MAG
      to act upon. The set of mobility options that can be present in
      the message is related to the Notification Reason field in the
      message.


5.2.  Update Notification Acknowledgement(UPA)

   The MAG sends an UPA message to a LMA in order to acknowledge that it
   has received an UPN message with the A bit set.

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Sequence Number: Copied from the UPN message being acknowledged.

      Status: Specifies the result of the MAG's processing of the UPN
      message. The status codes between 0 and 127 signify successful
      processing of the UPN message and codes between 128 and 255
      signify that an error occurred during processing of the UPN
      message.

      Mobility Options: Contains a set of mobility options used to
      provide context to the LMA. The set of mobility options that can
      be present in the message is related to the Status field in the
      message.



6.  Security Considerations

   The protocol specified in this document uses the same security
   association as defined in [RFC5213] for use between the LMA and the
   MAG to protect the UPN messages.Support for integrity protection
   using IPsec is REQUIRED, but support for confidentiality is NOT
   REQUIRED .


7.  IANA Considerations

   The Update Notification message require a single Mobility Header Type
   (TBA1) from the Mobility Header Types registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobility-parameters

   The Update Notification Acknowledgement message require a single
   Mobility Header Type (TBA2) from the Mobility Header Types registry
   at http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobility-parameters
