1.  Introduction

   The Uniform Resource Name (URN) technology [RFC2141] provides a way
   to generate persistent, location-independent, resource identifiers.
   The primary "scope" of a URN is provided by its namespace identifier
   (NID).  As described in the specification for namespace definition
   mechanisms [RFC3406], there are three kinds of NIDs: formal,
   informal, and experimental.  Most of the NIDs registered to date are
   formal: as far as is known the few informal namespaces have not been
   widely used, and the experimental namespaces are by definition
   unregistered.

   In particular, the experimental namespaces take the form "X-NID"
   (where "NID" is the desired namespace identifier).  Since the "x-"
   convention has been deprecated in general [RFC6648], it seems
   sensible to define a dedicated namespace identifier for use in
   private testing, as examples in documentation, and the like (similar
   to "example.com" and other domain names [RFC2606]).  Therefore this
   document registers "example" as a formal namespace identifier.
   Although publication of this document might make it possible to
   deprecate the class of experimental namespace identifiers, that is
   not its primary intent.


2.  Specification Template

2.1.  Namespace ID

   The Namespace ID "example" is requested.

2.2.  Registration Information

   Version 1

   Date: 2012-07-11

2.3.  Declared Registrant of the Namespace

   Registering organization: IETF

   Designated contact: IESG, iesg@ietf.org

2.4.  Declaration of Syntactic Structure

   The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the
   "example" NID shall have the following structure:

   urn:example:{NSS}

Internet-Draft                Example URNs                     July 2012


   The NSS is a mandatory string of ASCII characters [RFC20] that
   conforms to the URN syntax requirements [RFC2141] and that provides a
   name that is useful within the relevant documentation example, test
   suite, or other application.

2.5.  Relevant Ancillary Documentation

   See [RFC6648] for information about deprecation of the "x-"
   convention in protocol parameters and identifiers.

2.6.  Identifier Uniqueness Considerations

   Those who mint example URNs ought to strive for uniqueness in the
   namespace specific string portion of the URN.

2.7.  Identifier Persistence Considerations

   Once minted, an example URN is immutable.  However, it is simply a
   string and there is no guarantee that the documentation, test suite,
   or other application using the URN is immutable.

2.8.  Process for Identifier Resolution

   Example URNs are not intended to be resolved, and the namespace is
   not and probably never will be registered with a Resolution Discovery
   System.

2.9.  Rules for Lexical Equivalence

   No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence
   specified in [RFC2141] apply.

2.10.  Conformance with URN Syntax

   No special considerations

2.11.  Validation Mechanism

   None

2.12.  Scope

   Global


3.  Namespace Considerations

   No existing formal namespace enables entities to generate URNs that

   are appropriate for use in private testing, as examples in
   documentation, and the like.  It could be argue that no such formal
   namespace is needed, given that experimental namespaces can be minted
   at will.  However, experimental namespaces run afoul of the trend
   away from using the "x-" convention in the names of protocol
   parameters and identifiers [RFC6648].  Additionally, in practice
   specification authors often mint examples using fake NIDs that go
   unregistered because they are never intended to be used; to minimize
   the possibility of confusion, it seems preferable to create a
   dedicated namespace that can be used to generate example URNs.


4.  Community Considerations

   The "example" NID is intended to provide a clean, easily-recognizable
   space for minting examples to be used in documentation, in private
   testing, and the like.  The Namespace Specific String (NSS) needs to
   be a unique string, generated by the person, organization, or other
   entity that creates the documentation, test suite, or other
   application.  There is no issuing authority for example URNs and they
   cannot be resolved in any way.

   Note well that the example NID does not obviate the need to
   coordinate with issuing authorities for existing namespaces (e.g.,
   minting "urn:example:xmpp:foo" instead of requesting issuance of
   "urn:xmpp:foo"), to register new namespace identifiers if existing
   namespaces do not match one's desired functionality (e.g., minting
   "urn:example:sha-1:29ead03e784b2f636a23ffff95ed12b56e2f2637" instead
   of registering the "urn:sha-1" namespace), or to respect to the basic
   spirit of URN NID assignment (e.g., setting up shadow NIDs such as
   "urn:example:MyCompany:*" instead of using HTTP URIs or other
   formats).


5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no additional security considerations beyond
   those associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a URN NID registration of "example", to be
   added to the formal namespace registration; the completed
   registration template can be found under Section 2.
