Abstract

   This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). MPLS-TP extends MPLS
   technologies and introduces new OAM capabilities, a transport-
   oriented path protection mechanism, and strong emphasis on static
   provisioning supported by network management systems. This document
   addresses the security aspects relevant in the context of MPLS-TP
   specifically. It describes potential security threats, security
   requirements for MPLS-TP, and mitigation procedures for MPLS-TP
   networks and MPLS-TP interconnection to other MPLS and GMPLS
   networks. This document is built on RFC5920 "MPLS and GMPLS security
   framework" by providing additional security considerations which are
   applicable to the MPLS-TP extensions. All the security considerations
   from RFC5920 are assumed to apply.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionality of a packet transport network.

INTERNET DRAFT         MPLS-TP Security Framework      February 25, 2013


1. Introduction

   This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).

   As defined in MPLS-TP Requirements [RFC5654] and MPLS-TP Framework
   [RFC5921], MPLS-TP uses a subset of MPLS features and introduces
   extensions to reflect the characteristics of the transport
   technology. The additional functionality include in-band OAM,
   transport-oriented path protection and recovery mechanisms, and new
   OAM capabilities developed for MPLS-TP but apply to general MPLS and
   GMPLS. There is strong emphasis in MPLS-TP on static provisioning
   support through network management systems (NMS) or Operation Support
   Systems (OSS). 

   This document is built on RFC 5920 by providing additional security
   considerations which are applicable to the MPLS-TP extensions. The
   security models, threats, requirements, and defense techniques
   previously defined in [RFC5920] are assumed to apply to general
   aspect of MPLS-TP. 

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionality of a packet transport network.

   Readers can refer to [RFC5654] and [RFC5921] for MPLS-TP
   terminologies, and [RFC5920] for security terminologies which are
   relevant to MPLS and GMPLS.

2. Security Reference Models

   This section defines reference models for security in MPLS-TP
   networks.

   The models are built on the architecture of MPLS-TP defined in
   [RFC5921]. The placement of Service Provider (SP) boundaries plays
   important role in determining the security models for any particular
   deployment.

   This document defines a trusted zone as being where a single SP has
   total operational control over that part of the network.  A primary
   concern is about security aspects that relate to breaches of security
   from the "outside" of a trusted zone to the "inside" of this zone.

2.1. Security Reference Model 1

   In reference model 1, a single SP has total control of the PE/T-PE to
   PE/T-PE part of the MPLS-TP network.

   Security reference model 1(a)

   An MPLS-TP network with Single Segment Pseudowire (SS-PW) from PE1 to
   PE2.  The trusted zone is PE1 to PE2 as illustrated in Figure 1.

2.2. Security Reference Model 2

   In reference model 2, a single SP does not have the end-to-end
   control of the segment from PE/T-PE to PE/T-PE. Some S-PE(s), T-PE(s)
   may be under the control of other SPs, or the SP's customers, or its
   partners. In this case, the MPLS-TP network is not contained within a
   single trusted zone.

   Security Reference Model 2(a)

   An MPLS-TP network with Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) from T-PE1
   to T-PE2. The trusted zone is T-PE1 to S-PE1, as illustrated in
   Figure 3.

   should be applied to given network topology.

3. Security Threats

   This section discusses various network security threats that are
   unique to MPLS-TP and may endanger MPLS-TP networks.  

   Attacks to GAL or G-ACh may include:

      - GAL or BFD label manipulation, which includes insertion of false
      labels and modification, deletion, or replay of messages.

      - DoS attack through in-band OAM by generating excessive G-ACh/GAL
      and BFD messages which consume significant bandwidth and
      potentially cause congestion.

   These attacks can cause unauthorized protection switchover, inability
   to restore, or loss of network connectivity.

   When a NMS is used for LSP setup, the attacks to NMS can cause the
   above effect as well. Although this is not unique to MPLS-TP, MPLS-TP
   network can be particularly vulnerable to NMS attack due to the fact
   that static provisioning through NMS is a commonly used model. In the
   static provisioning model, a compromised NMS can potentially be
   comparable to a comprised control plane plus a comprised management
   plane in the dynamic controlled network model.

   Attacks to NMS may come from external attackers, or insiders. Outside
   attacks are initiated outside of the trusted zone by unauthorized
   user of the MPLS-TP network management systems. Insider attack is
   initiated from inside of the trusted zone by an entity with
   authorized access to the management systems, but performs unapproved
   harmful functions to the MPLS-TP networks. These attacks may be
   directly targeted to the NMS, or via the compromised communication
   channels between the NMS and the network devices that are being
   provisioned, or through the access of the users to the provisioning
   tools. The security threat may include disclosure of information,
   generating false OAM messages, taking down MPLS-TP LSPs, connecting
   to the wrong MPLS-TP tunnel end points, and DoS attacks to the MPLS-
   TP networks.

   There are other more generic security threat, such as: Unauthorized
   observation of data traffic (including traffic pattern analysis),
   modification, or deletion of a provider's or user's data, as well as
   replay or insertion of inauthentic data into a provider's or user's
   data stream. These types of attacks apply to MPLS-TP traffic
   regardless of how the LSP or PW is set up in a similar way to how
   they apply to MPLS traffic regardless how the LSP is set up. More

INTERNET DRAFT         MPLS-TP Security Framework      February 25, 2013


   details on the above mentioned threat are documented in [RFC5920].

   The threats may be resulting from malicious behavior or accidental
   errors.

   Example 1: Attack from users: Users of the MPLS-TP network may attack
   the network infrastructure or attack other users.

   Example 2: Attack from insiders: Employees of the operators may
   attack the MPLS-TP network, especially through NMS.

   Example 3: Attack from inter-connecting SPs or other partners: Other
   SPs may attack the MPLS-TP network, particularly through the inter-
   provider connections.

   Example 4: Attack as the result of operation errors: Operation staff
   may fail to follow the operational procedures or make operational
   mistakes.

4. Defensive Techniques

   The defensive techniques presented in this document and in [RFC5920]
   are intended to describe methods by which some security threats can
   be addressed. They are not intended as requirements for all MPLS-TP
   deployments. The specific operational environment determines the
   security requirements for any instance of MPLS-TP. Therefore,
   protocol designers should provide a full set of security
   capabilities, which can be selected and used where appropriate.  The
   MPLS-TP provider should determine the applicability of these
   techniques to the provider's specific service offerings, and the end
   user may wish to assess the value of these techniques to the user's
   service requirements.  

   Authentication is the primary defense technique to mitigate the risk
   of the  MPLS-TP security threat "GAL or BFD label manipulation", and
   "DoS attack through in-band OAM" discussed in Section 3.
   Authentication refers to methods to ensure that message sources are
   properly identified by the MPLS-TP devices with which they
   communicate. Authentication includes entity authentication for
   identity verification, management system authentication, peer-to-peer
   authentication, message integrity and replay detection to ensure the
   validity of message streams, network-based access controls such as
   packet filtering and firewalls, host-based access controls,
   isolation, aggregation, protection against denial of service, and
   event logging. Where these techniques apply to MPLS and GMPLS in
   general, they are described in Section 5.2 of [RFC5920]. 

   In addition to authentication, the following defense should also be

INTERNET DRAFT         MPLS-TP Security Framework      February 25, 2013


   considered to protect MPLS-TP networks. 

   - Use of Isolated Infrastructure for MPLS-TP 

   One way to protect the MPLS-TP infrastructure network is to use
   dedicated network resources to provide MPLS-TP transport services.
   For example, in security model 2 (Section 2.2), the potential risk of
   attacks on the S-PE1 or T-PE1 in the trusted zone may be reduced by
   using non-IP-based communication paths, so that the paths in the
   trusted zone cannot be reached from the outside via IP.

   - Verification of Connectivity

   To protect against deliberate or accidental misconnection, mechanisms
   can be put in place to verify both end-to-end connectivity and
   segment-by-segment resources.  These mechanisms can trace the routes
   of LSPs in both the control plane and the data plane. Note that the
   connectivity verification tools are now developed for general MPLS
   networks as well.

   The defense techniques are apply generally to MPLS/GMPLS are not
   detailed here, for example: 

      1) Authentication: including Management System Authentication,
      Peer-to-Peer Authentication, Cryptographic Techniques for
      Authenticating Identity; 

      2) Access Control Techniques; 

      3) Use of Aggregated Infrastructure; 

      4) Mitigation of Denial of Service Attacks; 

      5) Monitoring, Detection, and Reporting of Security Attacks. 

   Readers can refer to [RFC5920] for details.

   It is important to point out the following security defense
   techniques which are particularly critical for NMS due to the strong
   emphasis on static provisioning supported by NMS in MPLS-TP
   deployment. These techniques include: Entity authentication for
   identity verification, encryption for confidentiality, message
   integrity and replay detection to ensure the validity of message
   streams, as well as users access control and events logging which
   must be applied for NMS and provisioning applications.

   Security considerations constitute the sole subject of this document
   and hence are discussed throughout.

   This document evaluates MPLS-TP specific security risks and
   mitigation mechanisms which may be used to counter the potential
   threats.  All of the techniques presented involve mature and widely
   implemented technologies that are practical to implement. It is meant
   to assist equipment vendors and service providers, who must
   ultimately decide what threats to protect against in any given
   configuration or service offering from a customer's perspective as
   well as from a service provider's perspective.

6. IANA Considerations

      This document contains no new IANA considerations.
