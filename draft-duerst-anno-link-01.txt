Internet-Draft        'annotation-server' rel Type        September 2011


1.  Overview

   Various mechanisms have been proposed for creating annotations to Web
   pages (hereafter called "Web annotations").  While some such
   mechanisms are tightly integrated with the Web page itself, others,
   such as Annnotea [Annotea], allow storing Web annonations on
   arbitrary third-party servers.  This creates a lot of independence
   and flexibility, but also risks that annotations for the same Web
   page are scattered among various servers which cannot easily be
   found.

   To make it easier to find and place annotations for a given Web page
   on annotation servers, this document defines the 'annotation-server'
   Link Relation Type [RFC5988].  The link target is a suggestion for
   which server to use to find existing annotations and to place new
   annotations for the link context.  This Link Relation Type does not
   constrain the protocol to be used to store and retreive annotations.
   A future version of this document might propose additional
   application data to specify protocol details.


2.  Security Considerations

   Please see the security considerations section of [RFC5988].


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following Link Relation Type in the
   Link Relation Type Registry [RFC5988].  The registration template is
   as follows:

   Relation Name:
      annotation-server

   Description:
      Designates an annotation server used to store annotations
      for the link's context.

   Reference:
      RFC YYYY [RFC Editor: Please replace with actual RFC number.]

   Notes:
      currently none

   Application Data:
      currently none
