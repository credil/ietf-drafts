INTERNET DRAFT     E-VPN Interoperability with IP-VPN   October 22, 2012


1  Introduction


   E-VPN can be an integral part of an Integrated Routing and Bridging
   (IRB) solution which is capable of performing optimum unicast and
   multicast forwarding not just for L2 traffic (intra-subnet
   forwarding), as described in the baseline draft [E-VPN], but also is
   capable of performing optimum unicast and multicast forwarding for L3
   traffic (inter-subnet forwarding) as described in [DC-MOBILITY].

   Such IRB capability is of high relevance in data center applications
   where performing either L2 or L3 forwarding alone may not be
   sufficient.

1.1 Shortcomings of L2-Only Solution

   Figure-1 depicts a Data Center Network (DCN) using IP overlay where
   the PE functionality (and IP tunnel encapsulation) are either
   residing on physical Top of Rack (ToR) switches or on virtual
   hypervisor-based switches. In this document, we refer to these PE
   devices (either physical or virtual) that provide IP overlay
   tunneling as Network Virtualized Endpoints (NVEs). The DCN is
   connected to the Internet and/or enterprise/SP MPLS/IP core network
   via gateway (GW) nodes.

   If Network Virtualization Endpoints (NVEs) were only to provide L2
   service (and forwarding), then for two VMs on two different subnets,
   which need to communicate with each other, their packets need to be
   forwarded to a router (either physical or virtual). In the above
   diagram, the packets from the VMs need to be forwarded all the way to
   one of the GW devices to perform L3 forwarding. This is generally
   sub-optimal because the two VMs may be connected to the same virtual
   switch or the same TOR where L3 switching could have been performed
   locally. Even if the two VMs are located in different PODs within the
   same DC, and the traffic between the two VMs requires transitioning a
   core switch, adding a GW for L3 switching adds additional hops to the
   data path. However, if an NVE has IRB capability, then it can perform
   optimum L2 forwarding for intra-subnet traffic and optimum L3
   forwarding for inter-subnet traffic, delivering optimum forwarding of
   unicast and multicast packets at all time.

1.2 Shortcomings of L3-Only Solution

   Consider the scenario where a server is multi-homed to several ToR
   devices using an Ethernet Link Aggregation Group with LACP [802.1AX]
 


Sajassi et al.           Expires April 22, 2013                 [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT     E-VPN Interoperability with IP-VPN   October 22, 2012


   and the VMs are connected to a virtual bridge on the server - i.e.,
   there is an Ethernet bridge on the data path between the VMs and the
   TORs. The ToRs are acting as NVEs. In this scenario, the LAG spans
   across multiple PE devices (NVEs) and IGMP joins for the same
   multicast group can arrives at both PEs. As such, DF election and
   split-horizon filtering functions are required on the ToRs belonging
   to the same LAG in order to avoid loops and packet duplication.
   However, the existing IP-VPN solution does not provide such
   capabilities that are available in the E-VPN solution. Therefore,
   these ToR devices cannot be simple L3VPN PEs. 

   Assuming that the above shortcoming is addressed by adding DF
   election and split-horizon filtering to IP-VPN, several other issues
   will continue to exist with L3-only solution, particularly when
   attempting to rely on L3 forwarding for intra-subnet traffic:

   1. With L3 forwarding, in the absence of a default route, unknown IP
   destination addresses are dropped. Furthermore, an IP default route
   directs a particular traffic flow to a single next-hop or outbound
   interface. This means that L3 forwarding cannot support the
   forwarding semantics of a subnet broadcast.

   2. With L3 forwarding, the MAC header is link-local and MAC addresses
   are swapped on a hop-by-hop basis. This means that if an NVE resorts
   to L3 forwarding of intra-subnet traffic, then all hosts within the
   same subnet will receive traffic with the source MAC addresses set to
   the NVE's address(es) instead of the originating hosts' MAC
   addresses. As a result, any higher layer application which relies on
   the source MAC address for identifying the communicating endpoint
   will break, as it will no longer be able to tell apart the hosts
   within the subnet based on their MAC addresses. This essentially
   creates an address aliasing problem. A related issue, that results
   from the MAC address being rewritten by the NVE, is that the hosts
   can no longer perform duplicate MAC address detection.

   3. With L3 forwarding, the IP TTL is decremented with every routed
   hop. Some applications rely on this fundamental behavior to confine
   traffic to the originating subnet, by setting the TTL to 1 on
   transmission. Such applications will no longer work when intra-subnet
   traffic is L3 forwarded. 

   4. IPv6 link-local addressing and duplicate address detection
   [RFC4862] assumes and relies upon L2 connectivity within the subnet.
   These mechanisms will break if the NVE performs L3 intra-subnet
   forwarding.

   5. Finally last but not least, there are non-IP applications that
   require L2 forwarding or there are applications that rely on end host

   MAC addresses.

1.3 Combined L2 & L3 Solution: IRB

   An IRB solution based on E-VPN can address the shortcomings of L2-
   only as well as L3-only solutions, and provide optimum forwarding for
   both inter and intra subnet switching, not only within a DCN but
   across different DCNs. This E-VPN based solution fits well for DCN
   overlay and DCI applications, but typical deployments will include
   IP-VPN PEs that E-VPN PEs need to inter-operate with, such as:

   1) IP-VPN client sites accessing cloud services
   2) Communication with IP-VPN ToRs/VSw 
   3) Communication with IP-VPN GWs    

   Therefore, interoperability with IP-VPN PEs is of paramount
   importance.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.1 Interoperability Use-Cases 

   There are three use-cases that require interoperability between E-VPN
   and IP-VPN. Those are discussed next.

                  Figure 2: Interoperability Use-Cases

2.1.1 IP-VPN Clients Access to Cloud Services

   An SP offering IP-VPN services to an enterprise may wish to expand
   its service offering to include Cloud services, while leveraging its
   existing MPLS/IP infrastructure. The SP may deploy E-VPN on the NVE
   in order to support L2 connectivity between VMs. If the number of
   VPNs and routes per VPN is not high, the SP may extend the L3 edge to
   the NVE and implement that function on the ToR switch. An alternative
   would be to have the NVE be on the hypervisor, in higher scale
   scenarios. Either way, distributing the L3 edge to the NVE renders it
   possible to avoid having an IP-VPN GW for the DCN. For this scenario,
   interoperability between the E-VPN NVE and IP-VPN PE is required in
   order to enable the new service offering.

   For e.g., consider Figure 1 where an IP-VPN service is being offered
   between Enterprise sites 1 and 2. PE1 and PE2 act as IP-VPN PEs.
   Furthermore, assume that DCN2 employ E-VPN (i.e. NVE2 and NVE3 are E-
   VPN PEs). For the SP to offer Cloud service, interoperability between
   the IP-VPN PEs and E-VPN NVEs is required.

2.1.2 Communication with IP-VPN NVEs

   In certain deployments, where only L3 connectivity is required by
 


Sajassi et al.           Expires April 22, 2013                 [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT     E-VPN Interoperability with IP-VPN   October 22, 2012


   certain hosts (e.g. VMs), the NVEs associated with those hosts may
   employ IP-VPN functionality only. An example of this would be running
   the IP-VPN PE functionality on the hypervisor using the mechanisms of
   [L3VPN-ENDSYSTEM]. Other VMs may require both L2 as well as L3
   connectivity. The NVEs associated with those latter VMs would employ
   E-VPN. In order to allow for inter subnet communication between both
   categories of VMs (i.e. those which require L3 connectivity only and
   those requiring both L2 as well as L3 connectivity), interoperability
   is required between the IP-VPN and the E-VPN NVEs.

   To illustrate this with an example, consider the network of Figure 1.
   VM5 requires L3 connectivity only, and subsequently NVE3 employs IP-
   VPN PE functionality solely. VM3 requires both L2 and L3
   connectivity, hence, NVE2 is employing E-VPN PE functionality. For
   VM3 to be able to optimally communicate with VM5, seamless
   interoperability between IP-VPN and E-VPN is required.

2.1.3 Communication with IP-VPN GWs

   The DCN may include an IP-VPN GW in order to confine the routing
   tables of the NVEs to L3 routes that are local to the DCN. The NVEs,
   in this case, would have default routes pointing to the GW. When the
   NVEs need to provide L2 as well as L3 connectivity to the associated
   VMs, they must run E-VPN PE functionality. In order for the IP-VPN GW
   to learn reachability to the VMs local to the DCN, interoperability
   is required between E-VPN NVEs and the IP-VPN GW.

   As an example, consider the network of Figure 1 where the GW of DCN1
   is an IP-VPN gateway. If NVE1 employs E-VPN PE functionality, then
   interoperability between E-VPN and IP-VPN is required for
   connectivity between NVE1 and the GW.

2.2 Characteristics of Seamless Interoperability

   Seamless interoperability between E-VPN and IP-VPN must meet the
   following characteristics:

   - Be completely transparent to the operation of the IP-VPN PE. In
   other words, the IP-VPN PE would not even be aware that it is
   communicating with an E-VPN endpoint. As such, no upgrade to the IP-
   VPN nodes is required, not even a software upgrade.

   - Be optimal from data-plane forwarding perspective. This means that
   a gateway function is not required in order to normalize the
   encapsulation to Ethernet in order to support the interoperability.
   To elaborate on this: it is always possible to have an E-VPN PE

   encapsulation be terminated on each PE, with the added overhead of
   unnecessarily performing MPLS imposition and disposition on both PEs.
   A side-effect of this gateway approach is that the host MAC addresses
   will be visible to the E-VPN, and this may create scalability
   bottlenecks, especially in virtualized data center environments
   because of sheer number of host MAC addresses.  

3  An IRB Solution Based on E-VPN

   An IRB solution based on E-VPN can meet data center network
   requirements in terms of:

   - Providing optimal forwarding for intra-subnet (L2) traffic.

   - Providing optimal forwarding for inter-subnet (L3) traffic, by
   avoiding the need for a centralized L3 GW. This is because the E-VPN
   MAC Advertisement route can carry an IP address in addition to the
   MAC address.

   - Support for light-weight multicast using ingress replication, in
   cases where multicast applications are not required or dominant.

   - Support for optimal multicast delivery through P2MP tunnels, when
   required, to optimize DCN resources.

   - Support for multi-homing with active/active redundancy and per-flow
   load-balancing using multi-chassis LAG.

   - Support for network-based as well as host-based overlay models. 

   - Support for consistent policy-based forwarding for both L2 and L3
   forwarded traffic. 

3.1  E-VPN PE Model for Seamless Interoperability

   This section describes the PE data-plane model required to achieve
   seamless interoperability. 

   The E-VPN PE establishes a many-to-one mapping between EVIs and a
   VRF. For a given EVI, it is possible to have multiple associated
   bridge-domains using the VLAN-aware bundling service interface, as
   defined in [EVPN-REQ]. Each bridge-domain maps to a unique IP subnet
   within a VRF context. The following figure depicts the model where
   there are N VRFs corresponding to N tenants, with each tenant having
   2 EVIs and up to M subnets (bridge domains) per EVI.

   Note that this PE model provides flexibility for a wide gamut of
   deployment options. For example, one end of the spectrum would be

   with a single EVI per tenant being mapped to a single VRF. Each EVI
   hosts multiple bridge-domains (one bridge-domain per subnet). This
   model allows for L2 traffic segregation between different subnets in
   addition to L3 connectivity among those subnets, as long as global
   Service VLANs are assigned per tenant (this uses VLAN-aware bundling
   service in E-VPN). The other end of the spectrum is with multiple
   EVIs per tenant all mapped to a single VRF. Each EVI hosts a single
   bridge-domain in this latter case. This model allows for L2 traffic
   segregation between subnets in addition to L3 connectivity among
   those subnets without the need for globally assigned Service VLANs
   (this uses VLAN-based service in E-VPN).

   Figure 3: E-VPN PE Model for Seamless Interoperability with IP-VPN

   One way to visualize this model is to consider a bridged virtual
   interface (BVI) to be associated with every bridge-domain in a given
   EVI. The BVI is an L3 routed interface (hence terminates L2). All the

INTERNET DRAFT     E-VPN Interoperability with IP-VPN   October 22, 2012


   BVIs associated with a given EVI are placed in the same VRF.

   The IP forwarding table in a given VRF is shared in between E-VPN and
   IP-VPN. When an E-VPN MAC advertisement route is received by the PE,
   the MAC address associated with the route is used to populate the
   bridge-domain MAC table, whereas the IP address associated with the
   route is used to populate the corresponding VRF. For intra-subnet
   forwarding, the PE consults the bridge-domain MAC table whereas for
   inter-subnet forwarding the PE performs the lookup in the associated
   VRF.

   When an E-VPN packet is received by a PE, it decapsulates the MPLS
   header and then performs a lookup on the destination MAC address. If
   the MAC address corresponds to one of its BVI interfaces, the PE
   deduces that the packet must be inter-subnet routed. Hence, the PE
   performs an IP lookup in the associated VRF table. However, if the
   destination MAC address does not correspond to a  BVI, then the PE
   concludes that this packet needs to be intra-subnet switched, and no
   further IP lookup is needed.  

3.2  IP-VPN BGP support on E-VPN PEs

   The E-VPN PE learns host (e.g. VM) MAC addresses via normal bridge
   learning, and host IP addresses either via snooping of control
   traffic (e.g. ARP, DHCP..) or gleaning of data traffic. Once the PE
   learns a new MAC/IP address tuple, it advertises two routes for that
   tuple:

   - An E-VPN MAC Advertisement route using the E-VPN AFI/SAFI and
   associated NLRI, which is used to advertise reachability to other
   remote E-VPN nodes. The MAC route advertises both the IP and MAC
   addresses of the host.

   - An IP-VPN route using IP-VPN AFI/SAFI and associated NLRIs, which
   is used to advertise reachability to remote IP-VPN speakers. The IP-
   VPN route advertises only the IP address of the end-station.

   Given that on the E-VPN PEs there is a one-to-one mapping between an
   E-VPN Instance (EVI) and a VRF, the same BGP RT and RD are used for
   both E-VPN and IP-VPN routes. Received E-VPN routes carry both IP and
   MAC addresses. The MAC addresses are injected into BD tables whereas
   the IP addresses are injected into VRFs. When an E-VPN speaker
   receives an IP-VPN route from a remote IP-VPN speaker, it installs
   the associated IP address in the appropriate VRF. It should be noted
   that when a MAC address is installed in the EVI, it is only installed
   in a single BD associated with the subnet corresponding to the
   Ethernet Tag encoded in the E-VPN MAC route.

INTERNET DRAFT     E-VPN Interoperability with IP-VPN   October 22, 2012


   If, for a given tenant, the IP-VPN PEs only need to share IP-VPN
   routes for a subset of the subnets with their E-VPN PEs counterparts,
   then one RT is used as a common RT between IP-VPN and E-VPN PEs for
   the common subnets and a different one or more RTs are used by the E-
   VPN PEs for the other tenant subnets that don't need to share routes
   with the IP-VPN PEs. If further topology constraint is needed among
   E-VPN and IP-VPN PEs, then instead of a common RT, one can use
   additional RTs to satisfy the topology constraint. 


3.3 Handling Multi-Destination Traffic:

   A key issue is how to handle multi-destination traffic, since E-VPN
   uses an MPLS label for split-horizon, and the equivalent does not
   exist in IP-VPN. This can be solved in two different ways, depending
   on whether the network uses LSM or Ingress Replication:

   For LSM, two different sets of P2MP multicast trees can be used by
   the E-VPN PEs. One tree set encompasses only the IP-VPN endpoints
   whereas the second set includes only the E-VPN speakers. When an E-
   VPN PE receives a multi-destination frame, it sends a copy on each of
   the two trees associated with a given EVI/VRF. When the PE sends
   traffic on the IP-VPN tree, it does not include the split-horizon
   label since the IP-VPN endpoints do not understand this label. Note
   that this does not create any adverse side-effects because an E-VPN
   PE and an IP-VPN will never be combined in the same Redundancy Group
   (i.e. will never be multi-homed to the same Ethernet Segment), and as
   such the split-horizon filtering is never required on the IP-VPN PEs.

   For ingress replication, the E-VPN PE sends the right label stack
   depending on the capability of the receiving (i.e. egress) PE. When
   replicating to IP-VPN endpoints, the ingress PE simply does not
   include any split-horizon labels. 


3.2.1 Further optimization on RR

   It is possible to optimize the number of routes that are advertised
   by a given E-VPN speaker for a specific host address, by leveraging
   extra intelligence on the BGP route reflector. A future version of
   this document will describe the detailed procedures to achieve this.
