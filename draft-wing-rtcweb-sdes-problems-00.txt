Internet-Draft       Security Descriptions in RTCWEB       December 2012


1.  Introduction

   Over the years, there have been almost 20 different mechanisms for
   establishing SRTP [RFC3711] keys.  Several years ago, two RTPSEC BoFs
   (IETF66, IETF68) concluded that DTLS-SRTP was the preferred keying
   mechanism [RFC5479].  The RTCWEB working group has concluded that
   DTLS-SRTP [RFC5763] will be used for browser-to-browser calls.

   However, the RTCWEB working group has also been considering
   supporting Security Descriptions [RFC4568] as another keying
   mechanism.  The primary reason for allowing Security Descriptions is
   to allow easy interworking with existing SRTP endpoints that support
   Security Descriptions, that is, for calls from a browser to a non-
   browser and vise versa.  Other reasons are summarized in
   [I-D.ohlsson-rtcweb-sdes-support].


2.  Problems with Security Descriptions in RTCWEB

   This section describes the problems that occur by supporting Security
   Descriptions in the RTCWEB architecture.

2.1.  Downgrade Attacks

   At IETF83, RTCWEB reached consensus that (unencrypted) RTP would not
   be supported by RTCWEB endpoints.

   While RTCWEB has agreed DTLS-SRTP will be used for keying "between
   web browsers", there exists no cryptographically strong mechanism to
   enforce this restriction.  That is, there is no way to determine the
   remote peer supports DTLS-SRTP, because the signaling (indicating
   support of DTLS-SRTP) may have been manipulated on the path; the
   signaling is not integrity protected end to end.  This means all
   RTCWEB hosts are vulnerable to a downgrade attack to Security
   Descriptions (by merely removing the associated SDP lines).

   One mitigation is for the RTCWEB endpoint to integrity protect its
   signaling message and for the remote endpoint to validate the
   integrity of the received signaling message.  However, there is no
   existing mechanism to protect the message integrity in that manner.
   The existing SIP Identity [RFC4474] provides integrity protection of
   the entire SDP, including the IP addresses in the SDP, which does not
   survive SDP changes SBCs or by NATs doing SIP ALG rewriting.  That
   is, ICE would work alright with SIP Identity, but Trickle ICE is not
   described for SIP Identity.

   Another mitigation is to create a cryptographically strong mechanism
   to determine the SRTP keying supported by a remote endpoint, such as

   publishing into a directory (e.g., DNS protected by DNSSEC similar to
   how email's DKIM or SPF).  This is considered as an Identity Provider
   in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch].  However, this can be problematic
   in practice, as a SIP user can have multiple endpoints with the same
   identity (e.g., dwing@example.com) with different SRTP keying
   capabilities, such as a WEBRTC endpoint and a non-WEBRTC voicemail
   system.

                     | Alice +-------|  Bob  +-------+ Carol |
                     +-------+ media +-------+ media +-------+

                        Figure 1: RTCWEB trapezoid

2.2.  Impossible to Provide Strong Identity

   Security Descriptions cannot provide proof of identity.  It is often
   useful to know you are speaking to a bank, a merchant, a travel
   agency, or a specific person.  With Security Descriptions, this can
   never be achieved.

   With DTLS-SRTP, a strong identity could be assured, because each
   endpoint possesses a private key, and the DTLS-SRTP handshake proves
   the endpoint possesses that private key.  Their public key can be
   signed by an Identity Provider [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch], and
   correlated with the encrypted media stream
   [I-D.wing-sip-identity-media].

   There is no way for Security Descriptions to provide this
   functionality.

2.3.  Mixing Weakens Security for Conference Calls

   If a call starts as a browser-to-browser call, it will be keyed using
   DTLS-SRTP.  If another party is added to the call (becoming a 3-way
   call), and that new party is on an IP PBX using Security
   Descriptions, the new party will be keyed using Security
   Descriptions.

   This is shown in the diagram below, where Alice and Bob are both
   using web browsers and key using DTLS-SRTP, and then Carol joins the
   call and is keyed using Security Descriptions:

                                    +-------+
                                    | Alice |
                                    +---|---+
                                        /\
                             DTLS-SRTP /  \ SDES
                                      /    \
                             +-------+      +-------+
                             |  Bob  |------| Carol |
                             +-------+ SDES +-------+

                    Figure 2: Mixed DTLS-SRTP and SDES

   When this occurs, the creation of the Security Descriptions leg
   exposes all parties (Alice, Bob, and Carol) to the weaknesses of
   Security Descriptions.  The alternative, which maintains security of
   Alice and Bob's communications on their networks, is to interwork
   with Carol using DTLS-SRTP.

2.4.  Vulnerable to Passive Attack

   The session key that encrypts the SRTP stream is sent within SIP
   signaling, and is seen by all SIP signaling entities along the
   signaling path (SIP proxies, B2BUAs, SBCs).  Any of those SIP
   signaling entities can use the session key to decyrpt the SRTP-
   encrypted media, passively, without modifying any aspect of the
   signaling.  As shown in the figure below, an RTCWEB call can be
   between web servers in different administrative domains, and can
   traverse SIP proxies.  With Security Descriptions, an attacker can
   record the encrypted SRTP media and obtain the Security Description
   keys any time later and decrypt the media.  The Security Description
   keys can be obtained by compromising any of the signaling elements on
   the path, obtaining log files from any of the signaling elements on
   the path (e.g., such as from backup tapes).  As this attack is
   passive, the victims have no way to determine such an attack
   occurred.

                     +------------+  +-------------+  +------------+
                     | web server +--+ SIP proxies +--+ web server +
                     +-----+------+  +-------------+  +------+-----+
                           |                                 |
                           |                                 |
                           |                                 |
                      +----+--+                          +---+---+
                      | Alice +--------------------------+ Carol |

                      +-------+       SRTP media         +-------+

   There is no defense from this attack.

2.5.  Forking

   With Security Descriptions, the sender's key is included in the
   INVITE.  When SIP forks an INVITE to multiple user agents (such as
   with multiple telephone extensions) all of those user agents receive
   the key and could decrypt one direction of the SRTP flow if the SRTP
   is captured.  It is possible to correct this problem by issuing a re-
   INVITE (with a new key) after every initial INVITE, but that prevents
   a re-INVITE from being sent for other reasons (because only one
   INVITE can be processed at a time), and increases the number of call
   signaling messages.  Other approaches have been discussed, such as
   splitting the Security Descriptions key in half, and more recently
   [I-D.zhou-mmusic-sdes-keymod].

   It is possible to extend Security Descriptions to defend against this
   attack.
