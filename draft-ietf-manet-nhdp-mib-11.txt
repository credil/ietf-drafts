1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring parameters of the
   Neighborhood Discovery Protocol [RFC6130] process on a router.  The
   MIB defined in this memo, denoted NHDP-MIB, also reports state,
   performance information and notifications.  This additional state and
   performance information is useful to troubleshoot problems and
   performance issues during neighbor discovery.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
   [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   [RFC6130] allows a router in a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) to
   discover and track topological information of routers up to two hops
   away by virtue of exchanging HELLO messages.  This information is
   useful for routers running various routing and multicast flooding
   protocols developed within the IETF MANET Working Group.

4.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Notification Objects - triggers and associated notification
      messages allowing for asynchronous tracking of pre-defined events
      on the managed router.

Internet-Draft                The NHDP-MIB                  January 2012


   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the NHDP protocol process in the
      router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      NHDP protocol process on the router and the overall discovery
      performance within the MANET.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the NHDP-MIB module.  The MIB
   is arranged into the following structure:

   o  nhdpNotifications - objects defining NHDP-MIB notifications.

   o  nhdpObjects - defining objects within this MIB.  The objects are
      arranged into the following groups:

      *  Configuration Group - defining objects related to the
         configuration of the NHDP instance on the router.

      *  State Group - defining objects which reflect the current state
         of the NHDP instance running on the router.

      *  Performance Group - defining objects which are useful to a
         management station when characterizing the performance of NHDP
         on the router and in the MANET.

   o  nhdpConformance - defining the minimal and maximal conformance
      requirements for implementations of this MIB.

5.1.  Notifications

   This section describes the use of notifications, and mechanisms to
   enhance the ability to manage NHDP networks.

5.1.1.  Introduction

   Notifications can be emitted by an NHDP router as a reaction to a
   specific event.  This allows a network manager to efficiently
   determine the source of problems or significant changes of
   configuration or topology, instead of polling a possibly large number
   of NHDP routers.

Internet-Draft                The NHDP-MIB                  January 2012


5.1.2.  Notification Generation

   When an exception event occurs, the application notifies the local
   agent, which sends a notification to the appropriate SNMP management
   stations.  The message includes the notification type and may include
   a list of notification-specific variables.  Section 7 contains the
   notification definitions, which includes the variable lists.  At
   least one IP address of the NHDP router that originates the
   notification is included in the variable list so that the network
   manager may determine the source of the notification.

5.1.3.  Limiting Frequency of Notifications

   To limit the frequency of notifications, the following additional
   mechanisms are suggested, similar to those in [RFC4750]:

5.1.3.1.  Ignoring Initial Activity

   The majority of critical events occur when NHDP is enabled on a
   router, at which time the symmetric neighbors and two-hop neighbors
   of the NHDP router are discovered.  During this initial period, a
   potential flood of notifications is unnecessary since the events are
   expected.  To avoid unnecessary notifications, a router should not
   originate expected notifications until a certain time interval has
   elapsed, which is to be predefined by the network manager.

5.1.3.2.  Throttling Traps

   The mechanism for throttling the notifications is the same as in
   [RFC4750] (i.e. the amount of transmitted notifications per time is
   bounded).

   Appropriate values for the window time and upper bound are to be
   selected by the network manager and depend on the deployment of the
   MANET.

5.1.3.3.  One Notification per Event

   Similar to the according mechanism in [RFC4750], only one
   notification is sent per event.

5.2.  The Configuration Group

   The NHDP router is configured with a set of controls.  The
   authoritative list of configuration controls within the NHDP-MIB are
   found within the MIB module itself.  Generally, an attempt was made
   in developing the NHDP-MIB module to support all configuration
   objects defined in [RFC6130].  For all of the configuration

   parameters, the same constraints and default values of these
   parameters as defined in [RFC6130] are followed.  Refer to [RFC5148]
   for guidance on setting jitter related parameters, e.g.,
   nhdpMaxJitter.

5.3.  The State Group

   The State Group reports current state information of a router running
   [RFC6130].  The NHDP-MIB State Group tables were designed to contain
   the complete set of state information defined within the information
   bases specified in Section 6, Section 7 and Section 8 of [RFC6130].

   Two constructs, i.e., TEXTUAL CONVENTIONs, are defined to support of
   the tables in the State Group.  The NHDP protocol stores and indexes
   information through sets of (dynamically defined) addresses, i.e.,
   address sets.  Within SMIv2 it is not possible to index tables with
   variably defined address sets.  Hence, these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS are
   defined to provide a local mapping between NHDP managed address sets
   and SMIv2 table indexing.  These constructs are the NeighborIfIndex
   and NeighborRouterIndex.  These are locally (to the NHDP router)
   defined, unique identifiers of virtual neighbors and neighbor
   interfaces.  Due to the nature of the NHDP protocol, the local router
   may have identified distinct address sets but is not able to
   associate these as a single interface.  Hence, two or more
   NeighborIfIndexes pointing to multiple distinct address sets may in
   fact be related to a common neighbor interface.  This ambiguity may
   also hold with respect to the assignment of the NeighborRouterIndex.
   The local MIB agent is responsible for managing, aggregating and
   retiring the defined indexes, and in updating MIB tables using these
   indexes as the local router learns more about its neighbors'
   topology.  These constructs are used to define indexes to the
   appropriate State Group tables and to correlate table entries to
   address sets, virtual neighbor interfaces and virtual neighbors
   within the MANET.

5.4.  The Performance Group

   The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.
   This section lists objects for NHDP performance monitoring, some of
   which are explicitly defined in the NHDP-MIB and others which can be
   estimated through a combination of base objects from this MIB.
   Throughout this section, those objects will be pointed out that are
   intended as base objects which are explicitly defined within this MIB
   and those objects which can be estimated.

   Unstable neighbors or 2-hop neighbors and frequent changes of sets
   can have a negative influence on the performance of NHDP.  The
   following objects allow management applications to acquire

   information related to the stability and performance of NHDP:

   The following objects return statistics related to HELLO messages:

   o  Total number of sent HELLO messages on an interface

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: nhdpIfHelloMessageXmits

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Total number of received HELLO messages on an interface

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: nhdpIfHelloMessageRecvd

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Total number of sent periodic HELLO messages on an interface

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: nhdpIfHelloMessagePeriodicXmits

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Total number of sent triggered HELLO messages on an interface

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: nhdpIfHelloMessageTriggeredXmits

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Acquire history of HELLO message scheduling instances for a given
      time duration on an interface

         It is desirable to develop the history of the exact timestamps
         of each HELLO message that has been sent as well as the type of
         the message (triggered or periodical).  The list of events
         starts at the given point of time t0 and ends at the given time
         t1.

Internet-Draft                The NHDP-MIB                  January 2012


         This is a Derived Object estimated from the NHDP-MIB.  It is
         derived from, e.g., the nhdpIfHelloMessagePeriodicXmits Base
         Object from the NHDP-MIB.

   o  Histogram of the intervals between HELLO messages on an interface

         It is desirable to track the values (in a 2-dimensional array)
         that represent a histogram of intervals between HELLO messages.
         The histogram would display the distribution of intervals
         between two consecutive HELLOs using a given bin size.  It
         includes all HELLOs that have been sent after the given time t0
         and before the given time t1.

         This is a Derived Object to be estimated from objects within
         the NHDP-MIB.  It can be estimated from, e.g., the
         nhdpIfHelloMessagePeriodicXmits Base Object from the NHDP-MIB.
         The network management application could convert this
         information into the desired histogram.

   o  Changes of the frequency of the message scheduling on an interface

         This object will divide the given time interval from t0 to t1
         into a given number of equal parts.  It then creates a
         histogram for each part and calculates the distances (e.g.
         using the Bhattacharyya distance) between each two adjacent
         histograms in time.  A higher value between two histograms
         means more difference between the histograms.  For instance,
         this is representative of an event that suddenly sends many
         triggered HELLO messages, whereas before there have been only
         very few such triggered messages.

         This is a Derived Object estimated from objects within the
         NHDP-MIB, as previously discussed, albeit this is a bit more
         complex with respect to the management application.

   o  Average number of sent HELLO messages per second between the given
      time t0 and t1 on an interface

         This is a Derived Object estimated from, e.g., the
         nhdpIfHelloMessageXmits Base Object.

   o  Average number of received HELLO messages per second on an
      interface between the given time t0 and t1

         This is a Derived Object estimated from the NHDP-MIB.  See the
         previous discussion.

         NHDP-MIB.

   o  Average size in octets of received HELLO messages between the
      given time t0 and t1 on an interface

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Success rate of received packets (number of received packets
      divided by number of expected packets based on the packet sequence
      number)

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from this NHDP-MIB.  It
         is derived from, e.g., the nhdpDiscIfRecvdPackets and the
         nhdpDiscIfExpectedPackets Base Objects defined in this MIB.
         This metric is then computed by the network management
         application.

   The following objects inspect the frequency of all Neighbor Set
   changes:

   o  Number of Neighbor Set changes

         This object counts each Neighbor Set change.  A change occurs
         whenever a new Neighbor Tuple has been added, a Neighbor Tuple
         has been removed or any entry of a Neighbor Tuple has been
         modified.

         This is a Base Object.

   o  Acquire history of Neighbor Set changes

         This object returns the history of the exact timestamps of each
         time the Neighbor Set has been changed.

         This is a Derived Object estimated from the NHDP-MIB.  It is

   o  Histogram of the intervals between Neighbor Set changes

         Returns the values (in a 2-dimensional array) that represent a
         histogram of intervals between Neighbor Set changes.

         This is a Derived Object estimated from the previously
         discussed Base Object.

   o  Changes of the frequency of the Neighbor Set changes

         This object will divide the given time interval from t0 to t1
         into a given number of equal parts.  It then creates a
         histogram for each part and calculates the distances (e.g.
         using the Bhattacharyya distance) between each two adjacent
         histograms in time.  A higher value between two histograms
         means more difference between the histograms.

         'nbrup' or 'nbrdown'.  A neighbor is said to become 'nbrup' if
         a new Neighbor Tuple is created that corresponds to the given
         neighbor.  It becomes 'nbrdown' if such a Neighbor Tuple has
         been deleted.  The existence of a Lost Neighbor Tuple for that
         previous neighbor does not mean that the neighbor is still
         'nbrup'.

         This is a Derived Object estimated from, e.g., the
         nhdpDiscNeighborNibNeighborSetChanges Base Object defined in
         this MIB.

   o  Histogram of the intervals between a change of the 'nbrup' status
      of a given neighbor

         Returns the values that represent a histogram of intervals
         between a change of the 'nbrup' status of a given neighbor.
         The histogram includes all changes that have been made after
         the given time t0 and before the given time t1.

         This is a Derived Object estimated from, e.g. the
         nhdpDiscNeighborNibNeighborSetChanges Base Object defined in
         this MIB.  This object sits in the nhdpDiscNeighborSetPerfTable
         which is indexed by the nhdpDiscRouterIndex.

   The following objects examine the stability of a neighbor.  A
   neighbor is said to be unstable if it 'flaps' frequently between
   several links.  It is said to be stable if the set of Link Tuples
   that correspond to the given neighbor is stationary.

   o  Count the changes of the interface(s) over which a given neighbor
      (as listed in the Neighbor Set) can be reached

         This object counts each time the neighbor changes the
         interface(s) over which it is reachable.  A change in the set
         of Link Tuples corresponding to the appropriate Neighbor Tuple
         is registered, i.e. a corresponding Link Tuple is added or
         removed from the set of all corresponding Link Tuples.

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: nhdpDiscNeighborNibNeighborSetReachableLinkChanges

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Acquire history of changes of the interface(s) over which a given
      neighbor can be reached

         This object returns the history of the exact timestamps of each
         time the neighbor changes the interface(s) over which it is
         reachable.  That means that there is a change in the set of
         corresponding Link Tuples of for that Neighbor Tuple, i.e. a
         corresponding Link Tuple is added or removed from the set of
         all corresponding Link Tuples.

         This is a Derived Object estimated from, e.g., the
         nhdpDiscNeighborNibNeighborSetReachableLinkChanges Base Object.

   o  Histogram of the intervals between a change of the interface(s)
      over which a given neighbor is reachable

         Returns the values that represent a histogram of intervals
         between a change of the interface over which a given neighbor
         is reachable after the given time t0 and before the given time
         t1.

         This is a Derived Object estimated from the previously
         discussed Base Object, nhdpDiscNeighborNibNeighborSetChanges

   The following objects inspect the stability of a given 2-hop
   neighbor:

   o  Count the changes of the union of all N2_neighbor_iface_addr_list
      of 2-hop Tuples with an N2_2hop_addr equal to one of the given
      2-hop neighbor's addresses

         This object returns the count of the times the 2-hop neighbor
         changes the neighbor(s) over which it is reachable.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This section specifies the relationship of the MIB modules contained
   in this document to other standards, particularly to standards
   containing other MIB modules.  Definitions imported from other MIB
   modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in
   conjunction with the MIB module contained within this document are
   identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The NHDP-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to Routing Protocol MIBs Relying on the NHDP-MIB

   [RFC6130] allows routing protocols to rely on the neighborhood
   information that is discovered by means of HELLO message exchange.
   In order to allow for troubleshooting, fault isolation, and
   management of such routing protocols through a routing protocol MIB,
   it may be desired to align the State Group tables of the NHDP-MIB and
   the routing protocol MIB.  This is accomplished through the
   definition of two TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS in the NHDP-MIB: the
   NeighborIfIndex and the NeighborRouterIndex.  These object types are
   used to develop indexes into common NHDP-MIB and routing protocol
   State Group tables.  These objects are locally significant but should
   be locally common to the NHDP-MIB and the routing protocol MIB
   implemented on a common networked router.  This will allow for

Internet-Draft                The NHDP-MIB                  January 2012


   improved cross referencing of information across the two MIBs.

6.3.  MIB Modules Required for IMPORTS

   The following NHDP-MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB
   [RFC2863], INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001], and FLOAT-TC-MIB [RFC6340].

    DESCRIPTION
        "An arbitrary, locally unique identifier associated with a
        virtual interface of a discovered NHDP neighbor.
        Due to the nature of the NHDP protocol, the local router
        may not know if two distinct addresses belong to the
        same interface of a neighbor or to two different
        interfaces.  As the local router gains more
        knowledge of its neighbors, its local view may change and
        this table will be updated to reflect the local router's current
        understanding associating address sets to neighbor interfaces.
        The local router identifies virtual neighbor interface through
        the receipt of address lists advertised through an
        NHDP HELLO message.

        All objects of type NeighborIfIndex are assigned by the agent
        out of a common number space.

        The value for each discovered virtual neighbor
        interface must remain constant at least from
        one re-initialization of the entity's network management
        agent to the next re-initialization, except that
        if an application is deleted and re-created.  If the
        local router gains information associating two virtual
        interfaces on a neighbor as a common interface,
        then the agent must aggregate the two address sets to
        a single index chosen from the set of aggregated indexes,
        it must update all tables in this
        MIB which are indexed by indexes
        of type NeighborIfIndex.  It can then reuse freed
        index values following the next agent restart.

        The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP
        entity."

        virtual discovered neighbor (one or two hop).  Due to the
        nature of the NHDP protocol, the local router may identify
        multiple virtual neighbors  which in fact are one and
        the same.  Two hop neighbors with more than one advertised
        address will exhibit this behavior.  As the
        local router's knowledge of its neighbors' topology
        increases, the local router will be able to associate
        multiple virtual neighbor indexes into a single virtual
        neighbor index chosen from the set of aggregated indexes,
        it must update all tables in this MIB indexed by these
        indexes, and it can reuse the freed indexes following the
        next agent re-initialization.

        All objects of type NeighborRouterIndex are assigned by
        the agent out of a common number space.

        The NeighborRouterIndex defines a discovered NHDP peer
        virtual neighbor of the local router.
        The value for each discovered virtual neighbor index must remain
        constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's
        network management agent to the next re-initialization, except
        that if an application is deleted and re-created.

        The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP
        entity. An NeighborRouterIndex value must not be re-used
        until the next agent restart."

   -- Two new constructs have been defined in this MIB for
   -- indexing into the following
   -- tables and indexing into other tables in other MIBs.
   -- This was necessary because the NHDP protocol manages and
   -- indexes based upon dynamic address tuples, i.e.,
   -- address sets, while SMI requires statically
   -- defined indexes for accessing its table rows.
   -- The NeighborIfIndex defines a unique (to the local router)
   -- index referencing a discovered virtual interface on another
   -- neighbor within the MANET. The NeighborRouterIndex defines a
   -- unique (to the local router) index referencing a discovered
   -- virtual neighbor within the MANET.
   --
   -- Due to the nature of the NHDP protocol,
   -- different indexes may be related to common neighbor
   -- interfaces or common neighbor routers, but the information
   -- obtained through NHDP has not allowed the local router
   -- to relate these virtual objects (i.e., interfaces or routers)
   -- at this point in time.  As more topology information
   -- is gathered by the local router, it may associate
   -- virtual interfaces or routers and collapse these
   -- indexes appropriately.

   -- Multiple addresses can be associated with a
   -- given NeighborIfIndex.  Each NeighborIfIndex is
   -- associated with a NeighborRouterIndex.  Throughout
   -- the nhdpStateObjGroup, the
   -- NeighborIfIndex and the NeighborRouterIndex are used
   -- to define the set of IpAddrs related to a virtual
   -- neighbor interface or virtual neighbor under discussion.

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB defines objects for the configuration, monitoring and
   notification of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol [RFC6130].  NHDP
   allows routers to acquire topological information up to two hops away
   by virtue of exchanging HELLO messages.  The information acquired by
   NHDP may be used by routing protocols.  The neighborhood information,
   exchanged between routers using NHDP, serves these routing protocols
   as a baseline for calculating paths to all destinations in the MANET,
   relay set selection for network-wide transmissions etc.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  nhdpIfStatus - this writable object turns on or off the NHDP
      process for the specified interface.  If disabled, higher level
      protocol functions, e.g., routing, would fail causing network-wide
      disruptions.

   o  nhdpHelloInterval, nhdpHelloMinInterval, and nhdpRefreshInterval -
      these writable objects control the rate at which HELLO messages
      are sent on a wireless interface.  If set at too high a rate, this
      could represent a form of DOS attack by overloading interface
      resources.

   o  nhdpHystAcceptQuality, nhdpHystRejectQuality, nhdpInitialQuality,
      nhdpInitialPending - these writable objects affect the perceived
      quality of the NHDP links and hence the overall stability of the
      network.  If improperly set, these settings could result in
      network-wide disruptions.

   o  nhdpInterfaceTable - this table contains writable objects that
      affect the overall performance and stability of the NHDP process.
      Failure of the NHDP process would result in network-wide failure.
      Particularly sensitive objects from this table are discussed in

      the previous list items.  This is the only table in the NHDP-MIB
      with writable objects.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  nhdpDiscIfSetTable - The contains information on discovered
      neighbors, specifically their IP address in the
      nhdpDiscIfSetIpAddr object.  This information provides an
      adversary broad information on the members of the MANET, located
      within this single table.  This information can be use to expedite
      attacks on the other members of the MANET without having to go
      through a laborious discovery process on their own.  This object
      is the index into the table, and has a MAX-ACCESS of 'not-
      accessible'.  However, this information can be exposed using SNMP
      operations.

   MANET technology is often deployed to support communications of
   emergency services or military tactical applications.  In these
   applications, it is imperative to maintain the proper operation of
   the communications network and to protect sensitive information
   related to its operation.  Therefore, when implementing these
   capabilities, the full use of SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms for
   authentication and privacy is RECOMMENDED.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.  Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a
   draft document MUST use placeholders (such as "XXXX" above) rather
   than actual numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how
   this is done in a draft MIB module.

10.  Contributors

   This MIB document uses the template authored by D. Harrington which
   is based on contributions from the MIB Doctors, especially Juergen
   Schoenwaelder, Dave Perkins, C.M.Heard and Randy Presuhn.
