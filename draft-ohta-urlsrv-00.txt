Abstract

   DNS SRV RRs of a domain implicitly specify servers and port numbers
   corresponding to the domain.

   By combining URLs and SRV RRs, no port numbers have to be specified
   explicitly in URLs, even if non-default port numbers are used, which
   makes URLs more concise for port based virtual and real hosting,
   where port based real hosting means that multiple servers sharing an
   IP address are distinguished by port numbers to give service for
   different URLs, which is the case for port forwarded servers behind

INTERNET DRAFT         Using DNS SRV RRs with URLs        September 2011


   NAT and servers with realm specific IP.

1. Introduction

   This memo specifies informative guidelines on how to use DNS SRV RRs
   [SRV] with URLs [URI].

   Without explicitly specifying port numbers in URLs, SRV RR is useful
   to map a <reg-name> to IP addresses and port numbers of one or more
   servers, which can make URLs more concise for port based virtual and
   real hosting, where port based real hosting means that multiple
   servers sharing an IP address are distinguished by port numbers to
   give service for different URLs, which is the case for port forwarded
   servers behind NAT [NAT] and servers with realm specific IP [RSIP].

   For SRV RRs usable for a URL, the URL must include <reg-name>, a
   domain name, that is, have the following syntax [URI]:

      <scheme>://[<userinfo>@]<reg-name>[:<port0>]<path>[?<query>]

   It is also required that <reg-name> corresponds to a DNS hostname:
   <hostname>.

   The URL means a client and a <server> communicate over a protocol
   named <proto> using a single port number. In this memo, it is assumed
   that the client can deduce one or more <proto> from <scheme>.

   <proto> and <scheme> may be defined globally in Assigned Numbers or
   locally at <hostname> [SRV].

2. SRV Look Up

   First, SRV RRs of a DNS node, _<scheme>._<proto>.<hostname>, is
   looked up.

   If the node does not have any SRV RR, DNS derived address(es) of
   <hostname> is the address(es) of the server and <port0> (or default
   port of <scheme>) is the port number to be used.

   Otherwise, if the node has at least one SRV RR [SRV]:

      _<scheme>._<proto>.<hostname> SRV <priority> <weight>
                                        <port1> <target>

   <target> is the server to be used by the client. If there are
   multiple SRV RRs of the node, multiple <target>s are contacted in the
   order described by [SRV].

INTERNET DRAFT         Using DNS SRV RRs with URLs        September 2011


   If there are multiple <proto> names corresponding to <scheme>, all
   the SRV RRs for all the <proto> names are looked up and they are
   mixed together and tried in the order described by [SRV] as if all
   the RRs are located in a single domain. Note that the ordering rule
   in [SRV] is preserved between SRV RRs with same <proto>, even after
   mixing.

   If <port0> exists, <port0>+<port1> (with 16bit arithmetic) is the
   port number to be used. The reason of addition is that, if <port0> is
   explicitly specified, there is no reason to ignore it, but SRV RRs
   assumes all the <target> may not use a same port number, which will
   be the case with port forwarding with NAT and realm specific IP. So,
   <port0> is interpreted as an offset and added to <port1>.

   If <port0> does not exist, <port1> is the port number to be used,
   unless <port1> is 0. If <port1> is 0, <scheme> default port number
   should be used.

   If a server requests the client tell the URL used, reply should be
   the original URL:

      <scheme>://[<userinfo>@]<reg-name>[:<port0>]<path>[?<query>]

   not:

      <scheme>://[<userinfo>@]<target>:<port1>[+<port0>]<path>[?<query>]

   which enables name based virtual hosting by <reg-name> and improves
   security (see "Security Considerations" section).

3. Caching

   As SRV RRs of  _<scheme>._<proto>.<hostname> are looked up before
   address(es) of <hostname>, if _<scheme>._<proto>.<hostname> does not
   exist, extra DNS query is repeated every time <reg-name> appears in a
   URL.

   Thus, DNS should support negative caching.

   In addition, clients should remember non existence of the node
   _<scheme>._<proto>.<hostname> for a few minutes.

   Managers of a <hostname>, which does not need SRV, may also set up an
   SRV RR as:

      _<scheme>._<proto>.<hostname> SRV 0 1 0 <hostname>

   in addition to address RRs for <hostname>, which act as a positive

   cache with no effect (including an effect on port number, following
   zero replacing rules in the previous section).

4. Security Considerations

   Be aware that DNS look up of SRV RR may not be very secure.

   For example, SSL key of https://<reg-name> should be derived from not
   <target> but <hostname>.

5. IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
