       When a frame is received by an ingress NVE from a Tenant System over 
       a local VAP, it needs to be parsed in order to identify which 
       virtual network instance it belongs to. The parsing function can 
       examine various fields in the data frame (e.g., VLANID) and/or 
       associated interface/port the frame came from.  

       Once a corresponding VNI is identified, a lookup is performed to 
       determine where the frame needs to be sent. This lookup can be based 
       on any combinations of various fields in the data frame (e.g., 
       destination MAC addresses and/or destination IP addresses). Note 
       that additional criteria such as 802.1p and/or DSCP markings might 
       be used to select an appropriate tunnel or local VAP destination. 

       Lookup tables can be populated using different techniques: data 
       plane learning, management plane configuration, or a distributed 
       control plane. Management and control planes are not in the scope of

       this document. The data plane based solution is described in this 
       document as it has implications on the data plane processing 
       function. 

       The result of this lookup yields the corresponding information 
       needed to build the overlay header, as described in section 3.3.  
       This information includes the destination L3 address of the egress 
       NVE. Note that this lookup might yield a list of tunnels such as 
       when ingress replication is used for BUM traffic. 

       The overlay header MUST include a context identifier which the 
       egress NVE will use to identify which VNI this frame belongs to.  

       The egress NVE checks the context identifier and removes the 
       encapsulation header and then forwards the original frame towards 
       the appropriate recipient, usually a local VAP. 

    3. Data Plane Requirements 

    3.1. Virtual Access Points (VAPs) 

       The NVE forwarding plane MUST support VAP identification through the 
       following mechanisms:  

       - Using the local interface on which the frames are received, where 
          the local interface may be an internal, virtual port in a VSwitch 
          or a physical port on the ToR 
       - Using the local interface and some fields in the frame header, 
          e.g. one or multiple VLANs or the source MAC 

    3.2. Virtual Network Instance (VNI) 

       VAPs are associated with a specific VNI at service instantiation 
       time.  

       A VNI identifies a per-tenant private context, i.e. per-tenant 
       policies and a FIB table to allow overlapping address space between 
       tenants.  

       There are different VNI types differentiated by the virtual network 
       service they provide to Tenant Systems. Network virtualization can 
       be provided by L2 and/or L3 VNIs.  

    3.2.1. L2 VNI  

       An L2 VNI MUST provide an emulated Ethernet multipoint service as if 
       Tenant Systems are interconnected by a bridge (but instead by using 
     
     
    Lasserre, et al.        Expires May 28, 2013                  [Page 5] 
        
















    Internet-Draft        NVO3 Data Plane Requirements        November 2012 
     

       a set of NVO3 tunnels). The emulated bridge MAY be 802.1Q enabled 
       (allowing use of VLAN tags as a VAP). An L2 VNI provides per tenant 
       virtual switching instance with MAC addressing isolation and L3 
       tunneling. Loop avoidance capability MUST be provided. 

       Forwarding table entries provide mapping information between MAC 
       addresses and L3 tunnel destination addresses. Such entries MAY be 
       populated by a control or management plane, or via data plane.  

       In the absence of a management or control plane, data plane learning 
       MUST be used to populate forwarding tables. As frames arrive from 
       VAPs or from overlay tunnels, standard MAC learning procedures are 
       used: The source MAC address is learned against the VAP or the NVO3 
       tunnel on which the frame arrived. This implies that unknown unicast 
       traffic be flooded i.e. broadcast. 

       When flooding is required, either to deliver unknown unicast, or 
       broadcast or multicast traffic, the NVE MUST either support ingress 
       replication or multicast. In this latter case, the NVE MUST be able 
       to build at least a default flooding tree per VNI. In such cases, 
       multiple VNIs MAY share the same default flooding tree.  The 
       flooding tree is equivalent with a multicast (*,G) construct where 
       all the NVEs for which the corresponding VNI is instantiated are 
       members. The multicast tree MAY be established automatically via 
       routing and signaling or pre-provisioned. 

       When tenant multicast is supported, it SHOULD also be possible to 
       select whether the NVE provides optimized multicast trees inside the 
       VNI for individual tenant multicast groups or whether the default 
       VNI flooding tree is used. If the former option is selected the VNI 
       SHOULD be able to snoop IGMP/MLD messages in order to efficiently 
       join/prune Tenant System from multicast trees. 

    3.2.2. L3 VNI 

       L3 VNIs MUST provide virtualized IP routing and forwarding. L3 VNIs 
       MUST support per-tenant forwarding instance with IP addressing 
       isolation and L3 tunneling for interconnecting instances of the same 
       VNI on NVEs.  

       In the case of L3 VNI, the inner TTL field MUST be decremented by 
       (at least) 1 as if the NVO3 egress NVE was one (or more) hop(s) 
       away. The TTL field in the outer IP header MUST be set to a value 
       appropriate for delivery of the encapsulated frame to the tunnel 
       exit point. Thus, the default behavior MUST be the TTL pipe model 
       where the overlay network looks like one hop to the sending NVE. 
       Configuration of a "uniform" TTL model where the outer tunnel TTL is

       set equal to the inner TTL on ingress NVE and the inner TTL is set 
       to the outer TTL value on egress MAY be supported. 

       L2 and L3 VNIs can be deployed in isolation or in combination to 
       optimize traffic flows per tenant across the overlay network. For 
       example, an L2 VNI may be configured across a number of NVEs to 
       offer L2 multi-point service connectivity while a L3 VNI can be co-
       located to offer local routing capabilities and gateway 
       functionality. In addition, integrated routing and bridging per 
       tenant MAY be supported on an NVE. An instantiation of such service 
       may be realized by interconnecting an L2 VNI as access to an L3 VNI 
       on the NVE. 

       The L3 VNI does not require support for Broadcast and Unknown 
       Unicast traffic. The L3 VNI MAY provide support for customer 
       multicast groups. When multicast is supported, it SHOULD be possible 
       to select whether the NVE provides optimized multicast trees inside 
       the VNI for individual tenant multicast groups or whether a default 
       VNI multicasting tree, where all the NVEs of the corresponding VNI 
       are members, is used. 

    3.3. Overlay Module 

       The overlay module performs a number of functions related to NVO3 
       header and tunnel processing.  

       The following figure shows a generic NVO3 encapsulated frame:

       header when forwarding tenant traffic. Note that this information 
       can be carried within existing protocol headers (when overloading of 
       specific fields is possible) or within a separate header. 

    3.3.1.1. Virtual Network Context Identification 

       The overlay encapsulation header MUST contain a field which allows 
       the encapsulated frame to be delivered to the appropriate virtual 
       network endpoint by the egress NVE. The egress NVE uses this field 
       to determine the appropriate virtual network context in which to 
       process the packet. This field MAY be an explicit, unique (to the 
       administrative domain) virtual network identifier (VNID) or MAY 
       express the necessary context information in other ways (e.g. a 
       locally significant identifier).  

       It SHOULD be aligned on a 32-bit boundary so as to make it 
       efficiently processable by the data path. It MUST be distributable 
       by a control-plane or configured via a management plane.  

       In the case of a global identifier, this field MUST be large enough 
       to scale to 100's of thousands of virtual networks. Note that there 
       is no such constraint when using a local identifier. 

    3.3.1.2. Service QoS identifier 

       Traffic flows originating from different applications could rely on 
       differentiated forwarding treatment to meet end-to-end availability 
       and performance objectives. Such applications may span across one or 
       more overlay networks. To enable such treatment, support for 
       multiple Classes of Service across or between overlay networks MAY 
       be required.

    Internet-Draft        NVO3 Data Plane Requirements        November 2012 
     

       To effectively enforce CoS across or between overlay networks, NVEs 
       MAY be able to map CoS markings between networking layers, e.g., 
       Tenant Systems, Overlays, and/or Underlay, enabling each networking 
       layer to independently enforce its own CoS policies. For example: 

       - TS (e.g. VM) CoS 

            o  Tenant CoS policies MAY be defined by Tenant administrators 

            o  QoS fields (e.g. IP DSCP and/or Ethernet 802.1p) in the 
               tenant frame are used to indicate application level CoS 
               requirements 

       - NVE CoS 

            o  NVE MAY classify packets based on Tenant CoS markings or 
               other mechanisms (eg. DPI) to identify the proper service CoS 
               to be applied across the overlay network 

            o  NVE service CoS levels are normalized to a common set (for 
               example 8 levels) across multiple tenants; NVE uses per 
               tenant policies to map Tenant CoS to the normalized service 
               CoS fields in the NVO3 header 

       - Underlay CoS 

            o  The underlay/core network MAY use a different CoS set (for 
               example 4 levels) than the NVE CoS as the core devices MAY 
               have different QoS capabilities compared with NVEs.  

            o  The Underlay CoS MAY also change as the NVO3 tunnels pass 
               between different domains.  

       Support for NVE Service CoS MAY be provided through a QoS field, 
       inside the NVO3 overlay header. Examples of service CoS provided 
       part of the service tag are 802.1p and DE bits in the VLAN and PBB 
       ISID tags and MPLS TC bits in the VPN labels. 

    3.3.2. Tunneling function 

       This section describes the underlay tunneling requirements. From an 
       encapsulation perspective, IPv4 or IPv6 MUST be supported, both IPv4 
       and IPv6 SHOULD be supported, MPLS tunneling MAY be supported.

    3.3.2.1. LAG and ECMP  

       For performance reasons, multipath over LAG and ECMP paths SHOULD be 
       supported. 

       LAG (Link Aggregation Group) [IEEE 802.1AX-2008] and ECMP (Equal 
       Cost Multi Path) are commonly used techniques to perform load-
       balancing of microflows over a set of a parallel links either at 
       Layer-2 (LAG) or Layer-3 (ECMP). Existing deployed hardware 
       implementations of LAG and ECMP uses a hash of various fields in the 
       encapsulation (outermost) header(s) (e.g. source and destination MAC 
       addresses for non-IP traffic, source and destination IP addresses, 
       L4 protocol, L4 source and destination port numbers, etc). 
       Furthermore, hardware deployed for the underlay network(s) will be 
       most often unaware of the carried, innermost L2 frames or L3 packets 
       transmitted by the TS. Thus, in order to perform fine-grained load-
       balancing over LAG and ECMP paths in the underlying network, the 
       encapsulation MUST result in sufficient entropy to exercise all 
       paths through several LAG/ECMP hops. The entropy information MAY be 
       inferred from the NVO3 overlay header or underlay header. 

       All packets that belong to a specific flow MUST follow the same path 
       in order to prevent packet re-ordering. This is typically achieved 
       by ensuring that the fields used for hashing are identical for a 
       given flow. 

       All paths available to the overlay network SHOULD be used 
       efficiently. Different flows SHOULD be distributed as evenly as 
       possible across multiple underlay network paths. For instance, this 
       can be achieved by ensuring that some fields used for hashing are 
       randomly generated. 

    3.3.2.2. DiffServ and ECN marking 

       When traffic is encapsulated in a tunnel header, there are numerous   
       options as to how the Diffserv Code-Point (DSCP) and Explicit 
       Congestion Notification (ECN) markings are set in the outer header 
       and propagated to the inner header on decapsulation. 

       [RFC2983] defines two modes for mapping the DSCP markings from inner   
       to outer headers and vice versa.  The Uniform model copies the inner   
       DSCP marking to the outer header on tunnel ingress, and copies that   
       outer header value back to the inner header at tunnel egress.  The   
       Pipe model sets the DSCP value to some value based on local policy 
       at ingress and does not modify the inner header on egress.  Both 
       models SHOULD be supported.

    Internet-Draft        NVO3 Data Plane Requirements        November 2012 
     

       ECN marking MUST be performed according to [RFC6040] which describes 
       the correct ECN behavior for IP tunnels. 

    3.3.2.3. Handling of BUM traffic 

       NVO3 data plane support for either ingress replication or point-to-
       multipoint tunnels is required to send traffic destined to multiple 
       locations on a per-VNI basis (e.g. L2/L3 multicast traffic, L2 
       broadcast and unknown unicast traffic). It is possible that both 
       methods be used simultaneously.  

       There is a bandwidth vs state trade-off between the two approaches. 
       User-definable knobs MUST be provided to select which method(s) gets 
       used based upon the amount of replication required (i.e. the number 
       of hosts per group), the amount of multicast state to maintain, the 
       duration of multicast flows and the scalability of multicast 
       protocols.  

       When ingress replication is used, NVEs MUST track for each VNI the 
       related tunnel endpoints to which it needs to replicate the frame.  

       For point-to-multipoint tunnels, the bandwidth efficiency is 
       increased at the cost of more state in the Core nodes. The ability 
       to auto-discover or pre-provision the mapping between VNI multicast 
       trees to related tunnel endpoints at the NVE and/or throughout the 
       core SHOULD be supported. 

    3.4. External NVO3 connectivity 

       NVO3 services MUST interoperate with current VPN and Internet 
       services. This may happen inside one DC during a migration phase or 
       as NVO3 services are delivered to the outside world via Internet or 
       VPN gateways.  

       Moreover the compute and storage services delivered by a NVO3 domain 
       may span multiple DCs requiring Inter-DC connectivity. From a DC 
       perspective a set of gateway devices are required in all of these 
       cases albeit with different functionalities influenced by the 
       overlay type across the WAN, the service type and the DC network 
       technologies used at each DC site. 

       A GW handling the connectivity between NVO3 and external domains 
       represents a single point of failure that may affect multiple tenant 
       services. Redundancy between NVO3 and external domains MUST be 
       supported.

    Internet-Draft        NVO3 Data Plane Requirements        November 2012 
     

    3.4.1. GW Types 

    3.4.1.1. VPN and Internet GWs  

       Tenant sites may be already interconnected using one of the existing 
       VPN services and technologies (VPLS or IP VPN). If a new NVO3 
       encapsulation is used, a VPN GW is required to forward traffic 
       between NVO3 and VPN domains. Translation of encapsulations MAY be 
       required. Internet connected Tenants require translation from NVO3 
       encapsulation to IP in the NVO3 gateway. The translation function 
       SHOULD NOT require provisioning touches and SHOULD NOT use 
       intermediate hand-offs, for example VLANs. 

    3.4.1.2. Inter-DC GW  

       Inter-DC connectivity MAY be required to provide support for 
       features like disaster prevention or compute load re-distribution. 
       This MAY be provided via a set of gateways interconnected through a 
       WAN. This type of connectivity MAY be provided either through 
       extension of the NVO3 tunneling domain or via VPN GWs.   

    3.4.1.3. Intra-DC gateways 

       Even within one DC there may be End Devices that do not support NVO3 
       encapsulation, for example bare metal servers, hardware appliances 
       and storage. A gateway device, e.g. a ToR, is required to translate 
       the NVO3 to Ethernet VLAN encapsulation. 

    3.4.2. Path optimality between NVEs and Gateways 

       Within the NVO3 overlay, a default assumption is that NVO3 traffic 
       will be equally load-balanced across the underlying network 
       consisting of LAG and/or ECMP paths. This assumption is valid only 
       as long as: a) all traffic is load-balanced equally among each of 
       the component-links and paths; and, b) each of the component-
       links/paths is of identical capacity. During the course of normal 
       operation of the underlying network, it is possible that one, or 
       more, of the component-links/paths of a LAG may be taken out-of-
       service in order to be repaired, e.g.: due to hardware failure of 
       cabling, optics, etc. In such cases, the administrator should 
       configure the underlying network such that an entire LAG bundle in 
       the underlying network will be reported as operationally down if 
       there is a failure of any single component-link member of the LAG 
       bundle, (e.g.: N = M configuration of the LAG bundle), and, thus, 
       they know that traffic will be carried sufficiently by alternate, 
       available (potentially ECMP) paths in the underlying network. This 
       is a likely an adequate assumption for Intra-DC traffic where 
     
     
    Lasserre, et al.        Expires May 28, 2013                 [Page 12] 
        
















    Internet-Draft        NVO3 Data Plane Requirements        November 2012 
     

       presumably the costs for additional, protection capacity along 
       alternate paths is not cost-prohibitive. Thus, there are likely no 
       additional requirements on NVO3 solutions to accommodate this type 
       of underlying network configuration and administration. 

       There is a similar case with ECMP, used Intra-DC, where failure of a 
       single component-path of an ECMP group would result in traffic 
       shifting onto the surviving members of the ECMP group. 
       Unfortunately, there are no automatic recovery methods in IP routing 
       protocols to detect a simultaneous failure of more than one 
       component-path in a ECMP group, operationally disable the entire 
       ECMP group and allow traffic to shift onto alternative paths. This 
       is problem is attributable to the underlying network and, thus, out-
       of-scope of any NVO3 solutions. 

       On the other hand, for Inter-DC and DC to External Network cases 
       that use a WAN, the costs of the underlying network and/or service 
       (e.g.: IPVPN service) are more expensive; therefore, there is a 
       requirement on administrators to both: a) ensure high availability 
       (active-backup failover or active-active load-balancing); and, b) 
       maintaining substantial utilization of the WAN transport capacity at 
       nearly all times, particularly in the case of active-active load-
       balancing. With respect to the dataplane requirements of NVO3 
       solutions, in the case of active-backup fail-over, all of the 
       ingress NVE's MUST dynamically adapt to the failure of an active NVE 
       GW when the backup NVE GW announces itself into the NVO3 overlay 
       immediately following a failure of the previously active NVE GW and 
       update their forwarding tables accordingly, (e.g.: perhaps through 
       dataplane learning and/or translation of a gratuitous ARP, IPv6 
       Router Advertisement, etc.) Note that active-backup fail-over could 
       be used to accomplish a crude form of load-balancing by, for 
       example, manually configuring each tenant to use a different NVE GW, 
       in a round-robin fashion. On the other hand, with respect to active-
       active load-balancing across physically separate NVE GW's (e.g.: 
       two, separate chassis) an NVO3 solution SHOULD support forwarding 
       tables that can simultaneously map a single egress NVE to more than 
       one NVO3 tunnels. The granularity of such mappings, in both active-
       backup and active-active, MUST be unique to each tenant. 

    3.4.2.1. Triangular Routing Issues,a.k.a.: Traffic Tromboning  

       L2/ELAN over NVO3 service may span multiple racks distributed across 
       different DC regions. Multiple ELANs belonging to one tenant may be 
       interconnected or connected to the outside world through multiple 
       Router/VRF gateways distributed throughout the DC regions. In this 
       scenario, without aid from an NVO3 or other type of solution, 
       traffic from an ingress NVE destined to External gateways will take

    Internet-Draft        NVO3 Data Plane Requirements        November 2012 
     

       a non-optimal path that will result in higher latency and costs, 
       (since it is using more expensive resources of a WAN). In the case 
       of traffic from an IP/MPLS network destined toward the entrance to 
       an NVO3 overlay, well-known IP routing techniques MAY be used to 
       optimize traffic into the NVO3 overlay, (at the expense of 
       additional routes in the IP/MPLS network). In summary, these issues 
       are well known as triangular routing.  

       Procedures for gateway selection to avoid triangular routing issues 
       SHOULD be provided. The details of such procedures are, most likely, 
       part of the NVO3 Management and/or Control Plane requirements and, 
       thus, out of scope of this document. However, a key requirement on 
       the dataplane of any NVO3 solution to avoid triangular routing is 
       stated above, in Section 3.4.2, with respect to active-active load-
       balancing. More specifically, an NVO3 solution SHOULD support 
       forwarding tables that can simultaneously map a single egress NVE to 
       more than one NVO3 tunnels. The expectation is that, through the 
       Control and/or Management Planes, this mapping information MAY be 
       dynamically manipulated to, for example, provide the closest 
       geographic and/or topological exit point (egress NVE) for each 
       ingress NVE.   

    3.5. Path MTU 

       The tunnel overlay header can cause the MTU of the path to the 
       egress tunnel endpoint to be exceeded.  

       IP fragmentation SHOULD be avoided for performance reasons. 

       The interface MTU as seen by a Tenant System SHOULD be adjusted such 
       that no fragmentation is needed. This can be achieved by 
       configuration or be discovered dynamically.  

       Either of the following options MUST be supported: 

          o Classical ICMP-based MTU Path Discovery [RFC1191] [RFC1981] or 
            Extended MTU Path Discovery techniques such as defined in 
            [RFC4821] 

          o Segmentation and reassembly support from the overlay layer 
            operations without relying on the Tenant Systems to know about 
            the end-to-end MTU 

          o The underlay network MAY be designed in such a way that the MTU 
            can accommodate the extra tunnel overhead.

    3.6. Hierarchical NVE 

       It might be desirable to support the concept of hierarchical NVEs, 
       such as spoke NVEs and hub NVEs, in order to address possible NVE 
       performance limitations and service connectivity optimizations. 

       For instance, spoke NVE functionality MAY be used when processing 
       capabilities are limited. A hub NVE would provide additional data 
       processing capabilities such as packet replication. 

       NVEs can be either connected in an any-to-any or hub and spoke 
       topology on a per VNI basis. 

    3.7. NVE Multi-Homing Requirements 

       Multi-homing techniques SHOULD be used to increase the reliability 
       of an nvo3 network. It is also important to ensure that physical 
       diversity in an nvo3 network is taken into account to avoid single 
       points of failure. 

       Multi-homing can be enabled in various nodes, from tenant systems 
       into TORs, TORs into core switches/routers, and core nodes into DC 
       GWs. 

       Tenant systems can either be L2 or L3 nodes. In the former case 
       (L2), techniques such as LAG or STP for instance MAY be used. In the 
       latter case (L3), it is possible that no dynamic routing protocol is 
       enabled. Tenant systems can be multi-homed into remote NVE using 
       several interfaces (physical NICS or vNICS) with an IP address per 
       interface either to the same nvo3 network or into different nvo3 
       networks. When one of the links fails, the corresponding IP is not 
       reachable but the other interfaces can still be used. When a tenant 
       system is co-located with an NVE, IP routing can be relied upon to 
       handle routing over diverse links to TORs. 

       External connectivity MAY be handled by two or more nvo3 gateways. 
       Each gateway is connected to a different domain (e.g. ISP) and runs 
       BGP multi-homing. They serve as an access point to external networks 
       such as VPNs or the Internet. When a connection to an upstream 
       router is lost, the alternative connection is used and the failed 
       route withdrawn.

    3.8. OAM  

       NVE MAY be able to originate/terminate OAM messages for connectivity 
       verification, performance monitoring, statistic gathering and fault 
       isolation. Depending on configuration, NVEs SHOULD be able to 
       process or transparently tunnel OAM messages, as well as supporting 
       alarm propagation capabilities. 

       Given the critical requirement to load-balance NVO3 encapsulated 
       packets over LAG and ECMP paths, it will be equally critical to 
       ensure existing and/or new OAM tools allow NVE administrators to 
       proactively and/or reactively monitor the health of various 
       component-links that comprise both LAG and ECMP paths carrying NVO3 
       encapsulated packets. For example, it will be important that such 
       OAM tools allow NVE administrators to reveal the set of underlying 
       network hops (topology) in order that the underlying network 
       administrators can use this information to quickly perform fault 
       isolation and restore the underlying network.    

       The NVE MUST provide the ability to reveal the set of ECMP and/or 
       LAG paths used by NVO3 encapsulated packets in the underlying 
       network from an ingress NVE to egress NVE. The NVE MUST provide the 
       ability to provide a "ping"-like functionality that can be used to 
       determine the health (liveness) of remote NVE's or their VNI's. The 
       NVE SHOULD provide a "ping"-like functionality to more expeditiously 
       aid in troubleshooting performance problems, i.e.: blackholing or 
       other types of congestion occurring in the underlying network, for 
       NVO3 encapsulated packets carried over LAG and/or ECMP paths. 

    3.9. Other considerations 

    3.9.1. Data Plane Optimizations 

       Data plane forwarding and encapsulation choices SHOULD consider the 
       limitation of possible NVE implementations, specifically in software 
       based implementations (e.g.  servers running VSwitches) 

       NVE SHOULD provide efficient processing of traffic. For instance, 
       packet alignment, the use of offsets to minimize header parsing, 
       padding techniques SHOULD be considered when designing NVO3 
       encapsulation types. 

       The NV03 encapsulation/decapsulation processing in software-based 
       NVEs SHOULD make use of hardware assist provided by NICs in order to 
       speed up packet processing.

    3.9.2. NVE location trade-offs 

       In the case of DC traffic, traffic originated from a VM is native 
       Ethernet traffic. This traffic can be switched by a local VM switch 
       or ToR switch and then by a DC gateway. The NVE function can be 
       embedded within any of these elements. 

       The NVE function can be supported in various DC network elements 
       such as a VM, VM switch, ToR switch or DC GW. 

       The following criteria SHOULD be considered when deciding where the 
       NVE processing boundary happens: 

          o Processing and memory requirements 

              o Datapath (e.g. lookups, filtering, 
                 encapsulation/decapsulation) 

              o Control plane processing (e.g. routing, signaling, OAM) 

          o FIB/RIB size 

          o Multicast support 

              o Routing protocols 

              o Packet replication capability 

          o Fragmentation support 

          o QoS transparency 

          o Resiliency 

    4. Security Considerations 

       This requirements document does not raise in itself any specific 
       security issues.  

    5. IANA Considerations 

       IANA does not need to take any action for this draft.
