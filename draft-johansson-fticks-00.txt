1.  Introduction and Motivation

   Identity federations are often built as loosly coupled systems of
   identity providers and relying parties.  In such a system it is often
   important to collect statistics and meetering in a consistent way.

Internet-Draft                   fticks                     October 2013


   This document describes a simple (yet extensible) tex logformat which
   can be to communicate the essential aspects of authentication events
   to log reception software (eg syslog [RFC5424]).

2.  F-ticks Semantics

   An F-ticks log stream consists of a series of F-ticks log messages,
   each one represents a single authentication event.  Each log message
   is generated at a federation entity (eg an identity provider or a
   relying party).

3.  F-ticks Format

   An F-ticks log message is a text string that fulfills the following
   ABNF [RFC5234]:

   fticks = "F-TICKS/" federation-identifier "/" version attribute-list
   label = ( ALPHA / DIGIT / '_' / '-' / ':' / '.' / ',' / ';')
   federation-identifier = label
   version = label
   attribute-list = 1*("#" attribute "=" value ) "#"
   value = label
   attribute = ( ALPHA / DIGIT )


   The federation-identifier and version can be used by federations and
   other communities to indicate the type of attributes used.  This
   document does not describe any mandatory attributes but instead
   provides a list of attributes in use in various communities today.

   Future versions of this document may want to define an IANA registry
   for f-tick attribute definitions.

   Because of size constraints common to several log systems it is
   expected that f-ticks attributes are kept short.

4.  Common F-ticks Attributes

   In general a log consumer should not assume that any one attribute is
   present.  Depending on the situation any one of these (or any other
   defined attributes) may be missing from an F-ticks message.

4.1.  REALM

   The REALM attribute is used to convey the AAA-realm (eg RADIUS) of
   the authentication event.  The presence of the REALM attribute
   implies that the message was generated by a AAA-based identity
   provider.

Internet-Draft                   fticks                     October 2013


4.2.  VISCOUNTRY

   The ISO country code of the entity that generated the log messages.

4.3.  VISINST

   TODO

4.4.  CSI

   The Calling Station ID of the subject associated with the
   authentication event.  The presence of this attribute implies that
   the message was generated by an AAA-based identity provider.

4.5.  RESULT

   The result of the authentication event - either 'OK' or 'FAIL'.

4.6.  RP

   Relying Party identifier.  A string uniquely identifying the relying
   party invoved in the authentication event.

4.7.  AP

   Asserting party identifier.  A string uniquely identifying the party
   making the claim towards the relying party.  For an authentication
   event this is the identity provider.  For an attribute authority
   lookup event this is the AA identifier.

4.8.  TS

   A timestamp (seconds since the epoch) associated with the
   authentication event.  If this attribute is absent the consumer MAY
   choose to use a timestamp provided by the log message system (eg
   syslog) instead.

4.9.  AM

   Authentication Method identifier.

4.10.  PN

   A unique identifier for the subject involved in the event.

5.  Examples

   TBD

6.  Acknowledgements

   The f-ticks log format has been in use in the eduroam community since
   TTT and was originally conceived as a usage-tracking mechanism by
   Stefan Winter.

7.  Security Considerations

   Improperly configured logging may leak sensitive user information.
   In particular the PN attribute value (subject identitier) should be
   masked with a cryptographically keyed hash function before
   transmission.
