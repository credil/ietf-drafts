   As described in 2.5.6.1. ring protection of MPLS-TP requirements
   [RFC5654], several service providers have expressed much interest in
   operating MPLS-TP in ring topologies and required a high-level
   survivability function in these topologies.  In operation network
   deployment, MPLS-TP networks are often constructed with ring
   topologies.  It calls for an efficient and optimized ring protection
   mechanism to achieve simplified operation and fast recovery
   performance.

   The requirements for MPLS-TP [RFC5654] state that recovery mechanisms
   which are optimized for ring topologies could be further developed if
   it can provide the following features:

   a. Minimize the number of OAM entities for protection

   b. Minimize the number of elements of recovery

   c. Minimize the required label number

   d. Minimize the amount of control and management-plane transactions

   e. Minimize the impact on information exchange if the control plane
   supports

   This document specifies MPLS-TP Shared-Ring Protection mechanisms
   which can meet all those requirements on ring protection listed in
   [RFC5654].

   This document focus on the solutions for point-to-point transport
   path.  The solution for point-to-multipoint transport is under study
   and will be presented in a separate document.  The basic concept
   stated in this document also apply to point-multipoint transport
   path.

1.1.  Requirements for MPLS-TP ring protection

   The requirements for MPLS-TP ring protection are specified in
   RFC5654.  This document elaborates the requirements in detail.

1.1.1.  Recovery for Multiple failures

   MPLS-TP is expected to be used in carrier grade metro networks and
   backbone networks to provide mobile backhaul, carry business
   customers' services and etc., in which the network survivability is
   very important.  According to R106 B in RFC5654, MPLS-TP recovery
   mechanisms in a ring SHOULD protect against multiple failures.  The
   following context provides some more detailed illustration about
   "multiple failures".  In metro and backbone networks, the single risk

   factor often affects multiple links or nodes.  Some examples of risk
   factors are given as follows:

   - multiple links using fibers in one cable or pipeline

   - Several nodes shared one power supply system

   - weather sensitive micro-wave system

   Once one of the above risk factors happens, multiple links or nodes
   failures may occur simultaneously and those failed links or nodes may
   locate on a single ring as well as on interconnected rings.  Ring
   protection against multiple failures should cover both multiple
   failures on a single ring and multiple failures on interconnected
   rings.

1.1.2.  Smooth Upgrade from linear protection to ring protection

   It is beneficial for service providers to upgrade protection scheme
   from linear protection to ring protection in their MPLS-TP network
   without service interruption.  In-service insertion and removal of a
   node on the ring should also be supported.  Therefore, the MPLS-TP
   ring protection mechanism is supposed be developed and optimized to
   comply with this smooth upgrading principle.

1.1.3.  Configuration complexity

   While deploying linear protection in MPLS-TP networks, the
   configuration effort of protection depends on the quantity of the
   services carried.  In some large metro networks with more than ten
   thousand services access, the LSP linear protection capabilities of
   the metro core nodes should be large enough to meet the network
   planning requirements, which also leads to the complexity of network
   protection configuration and operation.  While ring protection can
   reduce the dependency of configuration on the quantity of services,
   it will simplify the network protection configuration and operation
   effort.In the application scenarios of deploying linear protection in
   MPLS-TP network, the configuration of protection has close
   relationship with the services, LSP quantities.  Especially in some
   large metro networks with more than ten thousands of services access
   node, the LSP linear protection capabilities of the metro core nodes
   should be large enough to meet the network planning requirements,
   which also leads to the complexity of network protection
   configurations and operations.  While the ring protection is based on
   the mechanisms on section layer, it has loose relationship with the
   services quantities which could simplify the network protection
   configurations and operations effort.

1.2.  Terminology and Notation

   The following syntax will be used to describe the contents of the
   label stack:

   1.  The label stack will be enclosed in square brackets ("[]").

   2.  Each level in the stack will be separated by the '|' character.

   It should be noted that the label stack may contain additional
   layers.  However, we only present the layers that are related to the
   protection mechanism.

   3.  If the Label is assigned by Node x, the Node Name will enclosed
   in bracket(" ()")

2.  Shared-ring protection for P2P

2.1.  Basic concept

   This document introduces a novel logic layer of the ring for both
   working path and protection path for shared ring protection in MPLS-
   TP networks.  As shown in Figure 1, the new logic layer is a ring
   tunnel on top of the working path or the protection path, namely
   working ring tunnel and protection ring tunnel respectively.  Once a
   ring tunnel is established, the configuration, management and
   protection of the ring are all based on the ring tunnel.  One port
   can carry multiple ring tunnels, while one ring tunnel can carry
   multiple LSPs.

2.1.1.  The establishment of the Ring tunnels

   LSPs which have same exit node share the same ring tunnel.  The exit
   node is the node where the traffic leaves the ring.  In other words,
   all the LSPs that traverse the ring and exit from the same node share
   the same working ring tunnel and protection ring tunnel.  For each
   exit node, four ring tunnels are established:

   - one clockwise working ring tunnel, which is protected by the
   following protection tunnel,

   - one anticlockwise protection ring tunnel,

   - one anticlockwise working ring tunnel, which is protected by the
   following protection tunnel,

   - one clockwise protection ring tunnel.

   An example is shown in Figure 3 where Node D is the exit node.  LSP
   1, LSP 2 and LSP 3 enter the ring from Node E, Node A and Node B,
   respectively, and all leave the ring from Node D. To protect these
   LSPs that traverse the ring, a clockwise working ring tunnel (RcW_D)
   via E->F->A->B->C->D, and its protection ring tunnel in the reverse
   direction (RaP_D) via D->C->B->A->F->E->D are established,
   respectively; Also, an anti-clockwise working ring tunnel (RaW_D) via
   C->B->A->F->E->D, and its clockwise protection ring tunnel (RcP_D)
   via D->E->F->A->B->C->D are established, respectively.  Figure 3 only
   shows RcW_D and RaP_D. A similar provisioning should be applied for
   any other node on the ring.  For other nodes in Figure 3 when acting
   as an exit node, the ring tunnels are created as follows:

   To Node A: RcW_A, RaW_A, RcP_A, RaP_A;

   To Node B: RcW_B, RaW_B, RcP_B, RaP_B;

   To Node C: RcW_C, RaW_C, RcP_C, RaP_C;

   To Node E: RcW_E, RaW_E, RcP_E, RaP_E;

   To Node F: RcW_F, RaW_F, RcP_F, RaP_F;

   For exit Node D, two working ring tunnels, RcW_D and RaW_D, are
   terminated on Node D, and two protection ring tunnels, RcP_D and
   RaP_D, are started from Node D. That means through these working ring
   tunnels with protection ring tunnels, LSPs which enter the ring from
   Node D can reach any other nodes on the ring, while Node D can also
   receive the traffic from any other nodes.

2.1.2.  The distribution and management of ring labels

   Ring tunnel labels are distributed by means of downstream-assigned
   mechanism as defined in [RFC3031].  When a MPLS-TP transport path,
   such as LSP, enters the ring, the ingress node pushes the working
   ring tunnel label and sends the traffic to the next hop according to
   the ring ID and the exit node.  The transit nodes within the working
   ring tunnel swap ring tunnel labels and forward the packets to the
   next hop; When arriving at the egress node, the egress node removes

   the ring tunnel label and forwards the packets based on the inner LSP
   label and PW label.  Figure 4 shows the label operation in the MPLS-
   TP shared ring protection mechanism.  Assume that LSP 1 enters the
   ring at Node A and exits from Node D, and the following label
   operations are executed.

   1.  The traffic LSP1 arrives at Node A with a label stack [LSP1] and
   is supposed to be forwarded in the clockwise direction of the ring.
   The clockwise working ring tunnel label RcW_D will be pushed at Node
   A, the label stack for the forwarded packet at Node A is changed to
   [RcW_D(B)|LSP1]

   2.  Transit nodes, in this case, Node B and Node C forward the
   packets by swapping the working ring tunnel labels.  For example, the
   label [RcW_D(B)|LSP1] is swapped to [RcW_D(C)|LSP1] at Node B.

   3.  When the packet arrives at Node D (i.e. egress node) with label
   stack [RcW_D(D)|LSP1], Node D removes RcW_D(D), and subsequently
   deals with the inner labels of LSP1.

   4.  All the LSPs which exit from the same node share the same set of
   ring tunnel labels.

   defined in [RFC6371].  Protection switching is triggered by the
   failure detection in a link in the ring monitored by OAM functions.

   Two end ports of a link form an MEG, and an MEG end point (MEP)
   function is installed in each ring port.  CC-V OAM packets are
   periodically exchanged between each pair of MEPs to monitor the link
   health.  Consecutive losses of CC-V packets (3 packets) will be
   interpreted as a link failure.

   A node failure is regarded as the failure of two links attached to
   the node.  The two nodes adjacent to the failed node detect the
   failure in the links that are connected to the failed node.

2.2.  P2P wrapping

   Normal state is shown in Figure 4.  The clockwise LSP1 towards node D
   enters the ring at Node A. In normal state, LSP 1 follows the path
   A->B->C-D, label operation is [LSP1](original data traffic carried by
   LSP 1)->[RCW_D(B)|LSP1](NodeA)->[RCW_D(C)|LSP1](NodeB)->[RCW_D(D)|
   LSP1](NodeC)->[LSP1]( data traffic carried by LSP 1).  Then traffic
   packet will be forwarded based on LSP1 at nodeD.

2.2.1.  Wrapping for Link Failure

   When a link failure between Node B and Node C occurs, both Node B and
   Node C detect the failure by OAM mechanism.  Node B switches the
   clockwise working ring tunnel (RcW_D) to the anticlockwise protection
   ring tunnel (RaP_D) and Node C switches anticlockwise protection ring
   tunnel(RaP_D) to the clockwisework ring tunnel(RcW_D).  The data
   traffic which enters the ring at Node A and exits at Node D follows
   the path A->B->A->F->E->D->C->D. The label operation is
   [LSP1](Original data traffic)-> [RcW_D(B)|LSP1](Node A)->
   [RaP_D(A)|LSP1](Node B)->[RaP_D(F)|LSP1](Node A)->[RaP_D(E)|LSP1]
   (Node F)->[RaP_D(D)|LSP1] (Node E)-> [RaP_D(C)|LSP1] (Node D)->
   [RcW_D(D)|LSP1](Node C)->[LSP1](Data traffic exits the ring).

2.2.2.  Wrapping for node Failure

   When Node B fails, Node A detects the failure between A and B and
   switches the clockwise work ring tunnel(RcW_D) to the anticlockwise
   protection ring tunnel(RaP_D), Node C detects the failure between C
   and B and switches the anticlockwise protection ring tunnel(RaP_D) to
   the clockwise working ring tunnel(RcW_D).  The data traffic which
   enters the ring at Node A and exits at Node D follows the path

   For traditional wrapping protection scheme, Protection switching
   execute at both nodes neighbored failure respectively , so the
   traffic will be wrapped twice.  This mechanism will cause more
   latency and bandwidth consume when traffic switched to protection
   path.

   For Short wrapping protection, switching only execute at up-stream
   node neighbored failure node, and exited ring in protection ring
   tunnel.  This scheme can optimized latency and bandwidth consume when
   traffic switched to protection path.

   In traditional wrapping solution, protection ring tunnel is a closed
   path in normal state, while in short wrapping solution, protection
   ring tunnel will remove at exit node.  Short wrapping is easy to
   implement in shared ring protection because the working and
   protection ring tunnel is established base on exit nodes.

   As show in figure 7, the data traffic which enters the ring at Node A
   and exits at Node D follows the path A->B->C->D in normal state.
   When a link failure between Node B and Node C occurs, NodeB switched
   work ring tunnel RcW_D to opposite protection ring tunnel RaP_D same
   as traditionally wrapping.  The different occurs in protection ring
   tunnel at exit node.  In short wrapping protection, Rap_D will remove
   in Node D and deal with inner LSP label.  So LSP1 will follows the
   path A->B->A->F->E->D when link failure between Node B and Node C
   when using short wrapping.

2.4.  P2P steering

   Each working ring tunnel is associated with a protection ring tunnel
   in the opposite direction.  Every node needs to know the ring
   topology by configuration or topology discovery.  When the failure
   occurs in the ring, the nodes which detect the failure will spread
   the failure information in the opposite direction node by node in the
   ring respectively.  When the node receives the message that informs
   the failure, it will quickly figure out the location of the fault by
   the topology information that is maintained by itself, so that it
   will determine whether the LSPs enter the ring from itself needs
   switch-over.  If yes, it will switch the LSPs from the working ring
   tunnel to its protection ring tunnel.

   Steering Example is shown in Figure 8.  LSP1 enters the ring from
   Node A while LSP2 enters the ring from Node B, and both of them have
   the same destination node D. As Figure 8 shows, in the normal state,
   LSP1 follows the path A->B->C->D, the label operation is

   [LSP1](original data traffic carried by LSP 1
   )->[RcW_D(B)|LSP1](NodeA)->[RcW_D(C)|
   LSP1](NodeB)->[RcW_D(D)|LSP1](NodeC)->[LSP1] ( data traffic carried
   by LSP 1) .  LSP2 goes through the path B->C->D, the label operation
   is [LSP2]->[RcW_D(C)|LSP2](NodeB)->[RcW_D(D)|LSP2](NodeC)-> [LSP2] (
   data traffic carried by LSP 1) .

   If the link between C and D breaks down, as Figure 8 shows, according
   to the fault detection function of each link, Node D will find out
   that there is a failure in the link between C and D, and it will
   update the link state of its ring topology, changing the link state
   between C and D from normal to fault, as Figure 8 shows.  In the
   direction that goes away from the failure point, Node D will send the
   state report message to Node E, informing Node E of the fault between
   C and D, and E will update the link state of its ring topology,
   changing the link state between C and D from normal to fault.  In
   this manner, the state report message is sent node by node in the
   clockwise direction.  Similar to Node D, Node C will spread the
   failure information in the anti-clockwise direction.

   Until Node A updates the link state of its ring topology and be aware
   of there is a fault within its working path, it can reach the
   conclusion that the anticlockwise path from A to D is working all
   right, and thus Node A will switch the LSP1 operation to the
   anticlockwise ring tunnel.

   LSP1 will follow the path A->F->E->D, the label operation is
   [LSP1](original data traffic carried by LSP 1 )->[RaP_D(F)|
   LSP1](NodeA)->[RaP_D(E)|LSP1](NodeF)->[RaP_D(D)|LSP1](NodeE)->[LSP1]
   ( data traffic carried by LSP 1).

   The same also apply to the operation of LSP2.  When Node B updates
   the link state of its ring topology, and finds out the working path
   fault, it will stop sending the LSP2 operation in the clockwise
   direction and switch the LSP2 to the anticlockwise protection tunnel.
   LSP2 goes through the path B->A->F->E->D, and the label operation is
   [LSP2](original data traffic carried by LSP 2 )-> [RaP_D(A)|LSP2](Nod
   eB)->[RaP_D(F)|LSP2](NodeA)->[RaP_D(E)|LSP2](NodeF)->[RaP_D(D)|LSP2](
   NodeE)->[LSP2]( data traffic carried by LSP 2).

   Assume that the ring between A and B breaks down, as Figure 9 shows.
   Like above, Node B will find out that there is a fault in the link
   between A and B, and it will update the link state of its ring
   topology, changing the link state between A and B from normal to
   fault.  The state report message is sent node by node in the
   clockwise direction, informing every node that there is a fault
   between node A and B, so that every node updates the link state of
   its ring topology.  Node A will find out a fault in the working path

   of LSP1, and switch LSP1 to the protection Ring tunnel, while Node B
   will find out the LSP2 working path is all right and there is no need
   for switching.

   In single-node interconnected rings, the connection between two rings
   is through a single node.  As the interconnection node may cause a
   single point of failure, this topology should be avoided in real
   networks;

   In dual-node interconnected rings, the connection between two rings
   is through two nodes.  The two interconnection nodes belong to both

2.5.2.1.  Introduction

   - Interconnected rings can be regarded as two independent rings.
   Each ring runs protection switching independently.  Failure in one
   ring only triggers protection switching in itself and does not affect
   the other ring.  Protection switch in a single ring is same as which
   described in section 3 Shared ring protection for P2P.

   - The service LSPs that traverse the interconnected rings via the
   interconnection nodes must use different ring tunnels in different
   rings.  The ring tunnel used in the source ring will be removed, and
   the ring tunnel of destination ring will be added in interconnection
   nodes.

   - For protected interconnection node in dual-node interconnected
   ring, the service LSPs in the interconnection nodes should use the
   same MPLS label.  So any interconnection node can terminate source
   ring runnel and push destination ring tunnel according to service LSP
   label.

   - Two interconnection nodes can be managed as a virtual
   interconnection node group.  Each ring should assign ring tunnels to
   the virtual interconnection node group.  The interconnection nodes in
   the group should terminate the working ring tunnel in each ring.
   Protection ring tunnel is a open ring to switch with the working ring
   tunnel at the nodes which detect the fault and end at the egress
   node.

   - When the service traffic passes through the interconnection node,
   the direction of the working ring tunnels in each ring for this
   service traffic should be the same.  For example, if the working ring
   tunnel follows the clockwise direction in Ring1, the working ring
   tunnel for the same service traffic in Ring2 also follows the
   clockwise direction when the service leaves Ring1 and enters Ring2.

2.5.2.2.  Ring tunnels of interconnected rings

   The same ring tunnels as described in 2.1.1 are used in each ring of
   the interconnected rings.  Besides, ring tunnels to the virtual
   interconnection node group will be established by each ring of the
   interconnected rings, i.e.:

   - one clockwise working ring tunnel to the virtual interconnection
   node group;

   - one anticlockwise protection ring tunnel to the virtual
   interconnection node group,

   - one anticlockwise working ring tunnel to the virtual
   interconnection node group;

   - one clockwise protection ring tunnel to the virtual interconnection

            Figure 12 Ring tunnels for the interconnected rings

   As shown in Figure 12, for the service traffic LSP1 which enters
   Ring1 at Node D and leaves Ring1 at Node F and continues to enter
   Ring2 at Node F and leaves Ring2 at Node I, the protection scheme is
   described below.

   In normal state, LSP1 follows R1cW_F&A in Ring1 and R2CW_I in Ring2.
   The label used for the working ring tunnel R1cW_F&A in Ring1 is
   popped and the label used for the working ring tunnel R2cW_I will be
   pushed based the inner label lookup at the interconnection node F.
   The working path that the service traffic LSP1 follows is:
   LSP1->R1cW_F&A (D->E->F)->R2cW_I(F->G->H->I)->LSP1.

Internet-Draft                    MSRP                         July 2013


   In case of link failure, for example, when a failure occurs on the
   link between Node F and Node E, Node F and E will detect the failure
   and execute protection switching as described in 2.2.1.1.  The path
   that the service traffic LSP1 follows after switching change to
   LSP1->R1cW_F&A(D->E)->R1aP_F&A(E->D->C->B->A->F)->R1cW_F(F)
   ->R2cW_I(F->G->H->I)->LSP1.

   In case of non interconnection node failure, for example, when the
   failure occurs at Node E in Ring1, Node F and E will detect failure
   and execute protection switching as described in 2.2.1.2.  The path
   that the service traffic LSP1 follows after switching becomes:
   LSP1->R1cW_F&A(D)->R1aP_F&A(D->C->B->A->F)->
   R1cW_F(F)->R2cW_I(F->G->H->I).

   In case of interconnection node failure, for example, when failure
   occurs at the interconnection Node F. Node E and A in Ring1 will
   detect the failure, and execute protection switching as described in
   2.2.1.2.  Node G and A in Ring2 will also detects the failure, and
   execute protection switching.  The path that the service traffic LSP1
   follows after switching is:
   LSP1->R1cW_F&A(D->E)->R1aP_F&A(E->D->C->B->A)->R1cW_A(A)
   ->R2aP_I(A->J->I)->LSP1.

2.5.2.4.  Interconnected ring topology detection mechanism

   As show in Figure 13, the service traffic LSP1 traverses A->B-C in
   Ring1 and C->G->H->I in Ring2.  Node C and Node D is the
   interconnection node.  When both the link between Node C and Node G
   and the link between Node C and Node D fail, ring tunnel from Node C
   to Node I in Ring 2 becomes unreachable.  However, Node D is still
   available, by which LSP1 can still reach Node I.

   In order to do so, the interconnection nodes need to know the ring
   topology in each ring independently so that they can judge whether a
   node is reachable.  The judgment is based on the knowledge of ring
   topology and the fault location as described in section 3.4.  The
   ring topology can be obtained by NMS or topology discovery
   mechanisms.  The fault location can be obtained by spreading the
   fault information around the ring.  The nodes which detect the
   failure will spread the fault information in the opposite direction
   node by node in the ring respectively.  When the interconnection node
   receives the message that informs the failure, it will quickly figure
   out the location of the fault by the topology information that is
   maintained by itself and determine whether the LSPs enter the ring
   from itself can reach the destination.  If the destination node is
   reachable, the LSP will exit the source ring and enter the
   destination ring.  If the destination node is not reachable, the LSP
   will switch to the anticlockwise protection ring tunnel.

   In Figure 13 Node C judges the ring tunnel to Node I is unreachable,
   the service traffic LSP1 of which the destination node on the ring
   tunnel is Node I should switch to the protection LSP (R1aP_C&D) so
   that the service traffic LSP1 traverses the interconnected rings at
   Node D. Node D will remove the ring tunnel label of Ring1 and add
   ring tunnel label of Ring2.
