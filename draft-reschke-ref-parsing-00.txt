         Processing potentially invalid URI and IRI References
                      draft-reschke-ref-parsing-00

Abstract

   The parsing of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs, RFC 3986) and
   Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs, RFC 3987) is defined in
   terms of Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF).  The ABNF grammars are
   defined in terms of valid identifiers, and thus technically do not
   address how to handle invalid ones.

   The URI specification however includes a note how to use Regular
   Expressions for parsing, and this note applies to invalid identifiers
   as well.  This document introduces terminology referring to
   potentially invalid identifiers, and demonstrates how the rules in
   the URI specification can be applied to them.

Internet-Draft         Parsing URI/IRI references              July 2011


1.  Introduction

   The parsing of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs, [RFC3986]) and
   Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs, [RFC3987]) is defined
   in terms of Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF).  The ABNF grammars are
   defined in terms of valid identifiers, and thus technically do not
   address how to handle invalid ones.

   The URI specification however includes a note how to use Regular
   Expressions for parsing, and this note applies to invalid identifiers
   as well.  This document introduces terminology referring to
   potentially invalid identifiers, and demonstrates how the rules in
   the URI specification can be applied to them.

2.  Terminology

   In addition to the terms defined in the URI specification, namely the
   Syntax Components (see Section 3 of [RFC3986]), this document
   defines:

   Candidate URI Reference

      A string that may or may not be a valid URI-reference according to
      Section 4.1 of [RFC3986].

   Candidate Scheme Component

      A string that may or may not be a valid URI scheme component
      according to Section 3.1 of [RFC3986].

   Candidate Authority Component

      A string that may or may not be a valid URI authority component
      according to Section 3.2 of [RFC3986].

   Candidate Path Component

      A string that may or may not be a valid URI path component
      according to Section 3.3 of [RFC3986].

   Candidate Query Component

      A string that may or may not be a valid URI query component
      according to Section 3.4 of [RFC3986].

   Candidate Fragment Component

      A string that may or may not be a valid URI fragment component
      according to Section 3.5 of [RFC3986].

3.  Processing

3.1.  Parsing a Candidate URI Reference into Components

   The regular expression given in Appendix B of [RFC3986] will parse
   any input string into a Candidate Scheme Component, a Candidate
   Authority Component, a Candidate Path Component, a Candidate Query
   Component, and a Candidate Fragment Component.  Note that of these
   five components, all components except for the Path Component can be
   undefined.

   If each of the defined components is valid according to the related
   URI component definition, the input was a valid URI reference.

3.2.  Resolution of Candidate References

   Section 5 of [RFC3986] defines Reference Resolution based on the five
   components.  This algorithm works both for components obtained from
   valid and invalid references.  The result will be a valid URI
   Reference if and only if the components used by the algorithm were
   valid themselves.

4.  Security Considerations

   [[anchor3: TBD]]

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA Considerations related to this specification.
