Internet-Draft        RSVP-TE Extensions for LI&LB         December 2012


1.  Introduction

   The requirements for Lock Instruct (LI) and Loopback (LB) in MPLS-TP
   are specified in [RFC5860], and the framework of LI and LB is
   specified in [RFC6371].

   In general the LI and LB are useful OAM functions for technologies
   which use GMPLS as control plane, e.g. time-division multiplexing,
   wavelength-division multiplexing, and packet switching.  It is
   natural to use and extend the GMPLS control plane protocol to provide
   a unified approach for LI and LB provisioning in all these
   technologies.

   This document specifies extensions to RSVP-TE to support lock
   instruct and loopback mechanism for LSPs.  The mechanisms are
   applicable to technologies which use GMPLS as control plane.  For
   MPLS-TP network, the mechanisms defined in this document are
   complementary to [RFC6435].


2.  Extensions to RSVP-TE

   The A (Administratively down) bit in ADMIN_STATUS object [RFC3471]
   [RFC3473] is used to indicate the lock/unlock of the LSP.  Format of
   ADMIN_STATUS Object is as below:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |            Length             | Class-Num(196)|   C-Type (1)  |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |R|                        Reserved               |H|L|I|C|T|A|D|
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Reflect (R): 1 bit - see [RFC3471]
   Handover (H): 1 bit - see [RFC5852]
   Lockout (L): 1 bit - see [RFC4872]
   Inhibit Alarm Indication (I): 1 bit - see [RFC4783]
   Call Control (C): 1 bit - see [RFC4974]
   Testing (T): 1 bit - see [RFC3471]
   Administratively down (A): 1 bit - see [RFC3471], reused for Lock
   Deletion in progress (D): 1 bit - see [RFC3471]

   A new bit is defined in Attribute Flags TLV [RFC5420] to indicate the
   loopback mode.  The bit number is TBA.

Bit Number   Name and Usage
TBA          Loopback mode desired.
             This flag indicates a particular node on the LSP is required
             to enter loopback mode.
             This MAY also be used for specifying the loopback state
             of the node.


3.  Operations

3.1.  Lock Instruct

   When an ingress LSR wants to put an LSP into lock mode, it MUST send
   a Path message with the Administratively down (A) bit and the Reflect
   (R) bit in ADMIN_STATUS Object set.  The intermediate nodes SHOULD
   forward the message with the A bit unchanged to the downstream .

   On receipt of this Path message, the egress LSR SHOULD try to take
   the LSP out of service.  If the egress LSR locks the LSP
   successfully, it SHOULD send a Resv message with the A bit in
   ADMIN_STATUS object set.  Otherwise, it SHOULD send a PathErr message
   with the Error Code "OAM Problem" and the new Error Value "Lock
   Failure", and the following Resv messages SHOULD be sent with the A
   bit cleared.  With this procedure, the intermediate nodes would also
   be aware of whether the LSP is in Lock mode or not.

   When an LSP is put in lock mode, the subsequent Path and Resv
   messages SHOULD keep the A bit in ADMIN_STATUS Object set.

   When the ingress LSR wants to take the LSP out of the lock mode, it
   MUST send a Path message with the A bit in ADMIN_STATUS Object
   cleared.  The intermediate nodes SHOULD forward this message with the
   A bit unchanged to the downstream.

   On receipt of this Path message, the egress LSR SHOULD try to bring
   the LSP back to service.  If the egress LSR unlocks the LSP
   successfully, it SHOULD send a Resv message with the A bit in
   ADMIN_STATUS Object cleared.  Otherwise, it SHOULD send a PathErr
   message with the Error Code "OAM Problem" and the new Error Value
   "Unlock Failure", and the following Resv messages SHOULD be sent with
   the A bit set.

   When an LSP is taken out of lock mode, the subsequent Path and Resv
   messages SHOULD keep the A bit in ADMIN_STATUS Object cleared.

3.2.  Loopback

   The loopback request can be sent either to the egress LSR or to a
   particular intermediate node.  The mechanism defined in
   [I-D.margaria-ccamp-lsp-attribute-ero] is used for addressing the
   loopback request to a particular node on the LSP.  The loopback
   request is acceptable only when the LSP is in lock mode.

   When a ingress LSR wants to put a particular LSR on the LSP into
   loopback mode, it MUST send a Path message with the Loopback bit in
   the Attribute Flags TLV set.  The mechanism defined in
   [I-D.margaria-ccamp-lsp-attribute-ero] is used to address the
   loopback request to the particular LSR.  The Administratively down
   (A) bit in ADMIN_STATUS object SHOULD be set to keep the LSP in lock
   mode.

   On receipt of this Path message, the target LSR of the loopback
   request SHOULD try to put the LSP into loopback mode.  If the node
   puts the LSP into loopback mode successfully, it SHOULD set the
   Loopback (B) bit in the RRO Attribute subobject [RFC5420] and push
   this subobject onto the RRO object in the corresponding Resv message.
   The Administratively down (A) bit in ADMIN_STATUS object SHOULD also
   be set in the Resv message.  If the node cannot put the LSP into
   loopback mode, it SHOULD send a PathErr message with the Error Code
   "OAM Problem" and the new Error Value "Loopback Failure".

   When the ingress LSR wants to take the LSP out of loopback mode, it
   MUST send a Path message with the Loopback (B) bit in the Attribute
   Flags TLV cleared.  The mechanism defined in
   [I-D.margaria-ccamp-lsp-attribute-ero] is used to indicate that the
   particular LSR SHOULD exit loopback mode for this LSP.  The
   Administratively down (A) bit in ADMIN_STATUS object SHOULD be set.

   On receipt of this Path message, the target LSR SHOULD try to take
   the LSP out of loopback mode.  If the node takes the LSP out of
   loopback mode successfully, it SHOULD clear the Loopback (B) Bit in
   the RRO Attribute subobject and push this subobject onto the RRO
   object in the corresponding Resv message.  The Administratively down
   (A) Bit in ADMIN_STATUS Object SHOULD be set.  Otherwise, the node
   SHOULD send a PathErr message with the Error Code "OAM Problem" and
   the new Error Value "Exit Loopback Failure".


4.  IANA Considerations

   One bit number Loopback needs to be assigned in the Attribute Flags
   registry.

   Four new Error Values need to be allocated for Error Code "OAM
   Problem": "Lock Failure", "Unlock Failure", "Loopback Failure", "Exit
   Loopback Failure".


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security issues above those
   identified in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].
