Internet-Draft           IPv6 for Cellular Hosts          September 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3316] lists a set of features to be supported by cellular hosts
   to connect to 3GPP cellular networks.  Since the publication of that
   document, new functions have been specified within 3GPP and IETF
   while others have been updated.

   Moreover, in light of recent IPv6 production deployments, additional
   features to ease IPv6-only deployments while continuing accessing to
   IPv4-only service are to be considered.

   This document updates [RFC3316] with new functionalities to be
   supported by cellular hosts.  Note [RFC3316] considered only GPRS and
   UMTS networks; this document also considers EPS (Evolved Packet
   System).

   A detailed overview of IPv6 support in 3GPP architectures is provided
   in [RFC6459].

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC6459].

   PREFIX64 denotes an IPv6 prefix used to build IPv4-converted IPv6
   addresses [RFC6052].

1.1.  Scope

   Various types of nodes are likely to be connected to 3GPP networks
   and will require specific functions.  Indeed, a 3GPP network can be
   used to connect a phone, a CPE, machine-to-machine (M2M) device, etc.
   Because of the diversity of terminals which may connect to 3GPP
   networks, this document provides first some generic IPv6
   functionalities which are valid for any node to be directly connected
   to 3GPP networks, whatever its function or whatever the services
   (e.g., DNS, SIP) it supports.  Then, dedicated sections are included
   to cover specific functionalities to be supported by some type of
   devices (e.g., smartphones, devices providing some LAN functions
   (mobile CPE or broadband dongles), M2M devices).

   M2M devices specifications are not considered in the first version of
   this document.

   The requirements listed below are valid for both 3GPP GPRS and 3GPP
   EPS access.  For EPS, "PDN type" terminology is used instead of "PDP
   context ".

Internet-Draft           IPv6 for Cellular Hosts          September 2012


2.  Connectivity Requirements

   REQ#1:  The cellular host MUST support IPv6 addressing architecture
      ([RFC4291]).  For address representation, [RFC5952] MUST be
      supported.

   REQ#2:  The cellular host MUST support both IPv6 PDP and IPv4v6 PDP
      contexts

         This allows each operator to select its own strategy regarding
         IPv6 introduction.  Both IPv6 and IPv4v6 PDP contexts MUST be
         supported in addition to IPv4 PDP context.  IPv4, IPv6 or
         IPv4v6 PDP-Context request accept depends on the mobile network
         support and configuration.

   REQ#3:  The cellular host MUST comply with the behavior defined in
      [TS.23060] and [TS.24008] in terms of requested PDP context type.
      In particular the cellular host MUST request an IPv6 PDP context
      if the cellular host is IPv6-only and requesting an IPv4v6 PDP
      context if the cellular host is dual stack or when the cellular
      host is not aware of connectivity types requested by devices
      connected to it (e.g., cellular host with LAN capabilities):

      *  If the requested PDP context IPv4v6 is not supported but IPv4
         and IPv6 PDP types are allowed, the cellular host is configured
         with an IPv4 address or an IPv6 prefix.  It MAY initiate
         another PDP request than the one already activated for a given
         APN.

      *  If the requested PDP type and subscription data allows only one
         IP address family (IPv4 or IPv6), the cellular host MUST NOT
         request a second PDP context to the same APN for the other IP
         address family.

   REQ#4:  The cellular host MUST support the PCO (Protocol
      Configuration Options) [TS.24008] to retrieve the IPv6 address(es)
      of the Recursive DNS server(s).

         In band signaling is a convenient method to inform the cellular
         host about various services, including DNS server information.
         It does not require any specific protocol to be supported and
         it is already deployed in IPv4 cellular networks to convey such
         DNS information.

Internet-Draft           IPv6 for Cellular Hosts          September 2012


   REQ#5:  The cellular host MUST support IPv6 aware Traffic Flow
      Templates (TFT) [TS.24008].

   REQ#6:  The cellular host SHOULD support Router Advertisement Options
      [RFC6106] for DNS configuration.

         The support of this function allows for consistent method to
         inform cellular host about DNS recursive server across various
         access network types.  The cellular host SHOULD support RA-
         based DNS information discovery.

   REQ#7:  The cellular host SHOULD embed a DHCPv6 client [RFC3736]

         In order to get some consistent way to inform cellular host
         about DNS recursive server across various access networks and
         in case [RFC6106] is not supported, the cellular host SHOULD
         retrieving DNS information using stateless DHCPv6 [RFC3736].

   REQ#8:  The cellular host SHOULD support a method to locally
      construct IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses [RFC6052].

         This allows to solve issues related to application which uses
         referral with IPv4 literals.

   REQ#9:  Particularly, the cellular host SHOULD support Customer Side
      Translator function (CLAT, [I-D.ietf-v6ops-464xlat]) function
      which is compliant with [RFC6052][RFC6145][RFC6146].

         CLAT function in the cellular host allows for IPv4-only
         application and IPv4-referals to work on an IPv6-only PDP CLAT
         function requires a NAT64 capability [RFC6146] in the core
         network.

   REQ#10:  The cellular device MAY embed a BIH function [RFC6535]
      facilitating the communication between IPv4 application and IPv6
      server.

   REQ#11:  The cellular device SHOULD embed a DNS64 function [RFC6147].

         This allows to be compatible with DNSSEC.  A means to configure
         PREFIX64 is required to be supported.

   REQ#12:  The cellular host SHOULD support PCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].

         The support of PCP is seen as a driver to save battery
         consumption exacerbated b keepalive messages and also to allow
         for successful incoming connections.  Indeed, because several
         stateful devices may be enabled in mobile networks (e.g., NAT,

Internet-Draft           IPv6 for Cellular Hosts          September 2012


         Firewalls), PCP can be used by the cellular host to control and
         to retrieve lifetime of NAT bindings, to ease NAT and Firewall
         traversal for applications embedding IP address, to reduce
         keep-alive messages and inherently save battery consumption.

   REQ#13:  A method to learn PREFIX64 SHOULD be supported by cellular
      hosts.

         The cellular host SHOULD implement the method specified in
         [I-D.ietf-behave-nat64-discovery-heuristic] to retrieve the
         PREFIX64.

   REQ#14:  The cellular host SHOULD support means to prefer native IPv6
      connection instead of crossing IPv4/IPv6 interworking devices or
      NAT44 when the cellular host gets dual stack connectivity.

         Cellular hosts SHOULD follow the procedure specified in
         [RFC6724] for address source selection.

         Some potential issues are discussed in
         [I-D.ietf-mif-happy-eyeballs-extension] for MIFed devices.

   REQ#15:  The cellular host SHOULD support the procedure defined in
      [RFC6555].

   REQ#16:  The cellular host MUST support ICMPv6 ([RFC4443])

         The base protocol MUST be fully implemented by every IPv6 node
         as indicated in Section 2 of [RFC4443].

   REQ#17:  The device MUST support the Neighbor Discovery Protocol
      ([RFC4861] and [RFC5942]).

   REQ#18:  The cellular host MUST support Stateless Address Auto
      Configuration ([RFC4862]) apart from the exceptions noted in
      [TS.23060] (3G) and [TS.23401] (LTE):

         Stateless mode is the only way to configure a cellular host.
         The GGSN must allocate a prefix that is unique within its scope
         to each primary PDP context.

         The cellular host MUST use the interface identifier sent in PDP
         Context Accept message to configure its link local address.
         The cellular host may use a different Interface Identifiers to
         configure its global addresses.

Internet-Draft           IPv6 for Cellular Hosts          September 2012


   REQ#19:  The cellular host SHOULD NOT perform Duplicate Address
      Detection (DAD) for these Global IPv6 addresses (as the GGSN or
      PDN-GW must not configure any IPv6 addresses using the prefix
      allocated to the cellular host).

2.1.  WiFi Connectivity

   It is more and more common that cellular hosts have some Wi-Fi
   interfaces in addition to cellular interface.  These hosts are likely
   to be connected to private or public hotspots.  Below are listed some
   generic requirements:

   REQ#20:  IPv6 MUST be supported on the Wi-Fi interface.

   REQ#21:  DHCPv6 client SHOULD be supported on Wi-Fi interface
      ([RFC3736])

   REQ#22:  Wi-Fi interface SHOULD support Router Advertisement Options
      for DNS configuration ([RFC6106])


3.  Advanced Requirements

   REQ#23:  The cellular host SHOULD support the Privacy Extensions for
      Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6 ([RFC4941])

         The activation of privacy extension makes it hard to track a
         host compared to using the same interface identifier over the
         time.  [RFC4941] does not require any DAD mechanism to be
         activated as the GGSN (or PDN-GW) MUST NOT configure any global
         address based on the prefix allocated to the cellular host.

   REQ#24:  The cellular host SHOULD support ROHC for IPv6 ([RFC5795])

         Bandwidth in mobile environments must be optimized as much as
         possible.  ROHC provides a solution to reduce bandwidth
         consumption and to reduce the impact of having bigger header in
         IPv6 compared to IPv4.

   REQ#25:  The cellular host SHOULD support IPv6 Router Advertisement
      Flags Options ([RFC5175]).

         Some flags are used by GGSN (or PDN-GW) to inform cellular
         hosts about autoconfiguration process.

Internet-Draft           IPv6 for Cellular Hosts          September 2012


   REQ#26:  The cellular host SHOULD support Path MTU discovery
      ([RFC1981]).  If MTU used by cellular hosts is larger than 1280
      bytes, they can rely on Path MTU discovery function to discover
      real path MTU.

   REQ#27:  The cellular host SHOULD support IPsec version 2 tunnel mode
      (IKE2, [RFC5996]).

   REQ#28:  The cellular host SHOULD support Router Advertisement
      extension for communicating default router preferences and more-
      specific routes [RFC4191].

   REQ#29:  The cellular host MAY support [RFC5555].


4.  Cellular Devices with LAN Capabilities

   Cellular devices may provide some IP service access to other devices
   connected to them.  In such case, all connected devices are sharing
   the same GPRS, UMTS or EPS connection.  These cellular devices can be
   a CPE or specific cellular hosts commercialized to set up rapidly
   LANs in various environment, or it can also be a smartphone or a
   dongles with tethering features.  In addition to the generic
   requirements listed in Section 2, these hosts will have to embed
   specific functions in order to allow other IP-enabled devices to get
   IP connectivity services through these cellular devices.

   Prefix delegation which allows to allocate a shorter prefix to a
   cellular host is only available since 3GPP Release 10.  For
   deployments requiring to share the same /64 prefix, the cellular
   device MUST support a mechanism (e.g., ND Proxy function [RFC4389])
   to enable sharing a /64 prefix between the 3GPP interface towards the
   GGSN (WAN interface) and the LAN interfaces.  Note, ND Proxy
   [RFC4389] has some limitations regarding Duplicate Address Detection
   and multilink subnet requirements but it provides IPv6 connectivity
   in some basic scenarios.

   REQ#30:  The cellular device MUST support Prefix Delegation
      capabilities [RFC3633] and MUST support Prefix Exclude Option for
      DHCPv6-based Prefix Delegation as defined in [RFC6603].
      Particularly, it MUST behave as a Requesting Router.

         Cellular networks are more and more perceived as an alternative
         to fixed networks for home services delivery; especially with
         the advent of smartphones and dongles.  There is a need for an
         efficient mechanism to assign shorter prefix than /64 to
         cellular hosts so that each LAN segment can get its own /64
         prefix and multilink subnet issues to be avoided.

Internet-Draft           IPv6 for Cellular Hosts          September 2012


         In case a prefix is delegated to a cellular host using DHCPv6,
         the cellular device will be configured with two prefixes: (1)
         one for 3GPP link allocated using SLAAC mechanism and (2)
         another one delegated for LANs acquired during Prefix
         Delegation operation.  Note that the 3GPP network architecture
         requires both the WAN and the Delegated Prefix to be
         aggregatable, so the subscriber can be identified using a
         single prefix.

         Without Prefix Exclude Option, the delegating router (GGSN/
         PDN-GW) will have to assure [RFC3633] compliancy (e.g., halving
         the Delegated prefix and assigning the WAN prefix out of the
         1st half and the prefix to be delegated to the terminal from
         the 2nd half).

   REQ#31:  The cellular device SHOULD support Customer Side Translator
      (CLAT) [I-D.ietf-v6ops-464xlat].

         Various IP devices are likely to be connected to cellular
         device, acting as a CPE.  Some of these devices can be dual
         stack, others are IPv6-only or IPv4-only.  IPv6-only
         connectivity for cellular device does not allow IPv4-only
         sessions to be established for hosts connected on LAN segment
         of cellular devices.

         In order to allow IPv4 sessions establishment initiated from
         devices located on LAN segment side and target IPv4 nodes, a
         solution consists in integrating the CLAT function in the
         cellular device.  As elaborated in Section 2, the CLAT function
         allows also IPv4 applications to continue running over an IPv6-
         only host.

   REQ#32:  The cellular device MUST be compliant with CPE requirements
      specified in [RFC6204].

         [DISCUSSION NOTE: Check whether a reference to
         [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router-bis] is to be added too.]


5.  APIs & Applications

   REQ#33:  Name resolution libraries MUST support both IPv4 and IPv6.

   REQ#34:  Applications MUST be independent of the underlying IP
      address family.

   REQ#35:  Applications using URIs MUST follow [RFC3986].  For example,
      SIP applications MUST follow the correction defined in [RFC5954].


6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations identified in [RFC3316] are to be taken into
   account.

   REQ#36:  If the cellular device provides LAN features, it SHOULD be
      compliant with security requirements specified in [RFC6092].


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.
