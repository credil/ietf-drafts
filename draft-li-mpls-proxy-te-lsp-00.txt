        Proxy MPLS Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path(LSP)
                     draft-li-mpls-proxy-te-lsp-00

Abstract

   This document describes a method to setup MPLS TE proxy egress LSP
   which helps setup end-to-end LSP through stitching MPLS TE proxy
   egress LSP with BGP LSP in the Seamless MPLS network.  The method is
   achieved by new Proxy Destination Object carried in RSVP-TE messages.

1.  Introduction

   Seamless MPLS[I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls] provides an end to end
   service independent transport architecture.  It removes the need for
   service specific configurations in network transport nodes.  Seamless
   MPLS uses existing protocols like LDP, IS-IS to build intra-area
   segments and uses MP-BGP as the inter-area routing and label
   distribution protocol.

   One common procedure of setting up the end-to-end transport LSP is as
   follows:

   1.  Setup the access segment LSP from Access Node (AN) to Aggregation
   Node (AGN) using LDP with longest-match as defined in [RFC5283].  It
   requires only static routes and it is not necessary to know the
   actual destination (FEC of the LDP LSP);

   2.  The Aggregation Node (AGN) stitches the egress LDP LSP with the
   BGP ingress LSP according to the key of FEC;

   3.  The remote Aggregation Node (AGN) stitches the egress BGP LSP
   with an ingress LSP according to the key of FEC.

   LSPs set up with MPLS TE (RSVP-TE) provide a higher reliability and
   better QoS as compared to LSPs set up with LDP.  So MPLS TE is always
   adopted to deploy in the mobile backhaul network.  But when the
   mobile backhaul network integrates with the core/aggregation network
   based on Seamless MPLS, it is difficult to setup end-to-end MPLS TE

Internet-Draft                Proxy TE LSP                     July 2013


   LSP spanning multiple domains.  The possible way to setup the end-to-
   end LSP is that the proxy egress RSVP-TE LSP should be able to setup
   in the mobile backhaul network to stitch with BGP LSP at the
   Aggregation Node.

   This document extends RSVP-TE extension and introduces a new Proxy
   Destination Object.  Through the RSVP-TE extension the proxy egress
   LSP can setup for RSVP-TE.  It makes possible to setup the end-to-end
   LSP when deploy MPLS TE in the Seamless MPLS scenario to integrate
   the mobile backhaul network with the core/aggregation network.

2.  Terminology

   Proxy Egress LSP: It is defined in Sec. 4.1.4 of [RFC3031].  It is
   the LSP which is setup by the proxy egress LSR instead of the actual
   destination LSR.

3.  Solutions

   When setup a proxy egress RSVP-TE LSP in the Seamless MPLS scenario
   as shown in the Figure 1, there are two destination addresses to be
   carried by the RSVP-TE message: the actual destination address is the
   destination address of the end-to-end LSP by stitching the proxy
   egress LSP and the BGP LSP, the proxy destination address is the
   address of Aggregation Node which stitches the proxy egress RSVP-TE
   LSP and BGP LSP.  When setting up the proxy egress RSVP-TE LSP on the
   Access Node, it is necessary to specify the actual destination
   address and the proxy destination address.  The access node needs to
   calculate the path based on the proxy destination address for the
   proxy egress RSVP-TE LSP.  The Path message will be sent from the
   ingress node to the proxy destination node which is identified by the
   proxy destination address in the message.  Then the proxy destination
   node sends back the Resv message to allocate label and reserve
   resource.  The actual destination address is used to stitch with BGP
   LSP which has the same address as the actual destination address of
   the proxy egress RSVP-TE LSP.

           Figure 4 Seamless MPLS Scenario with MPLS TE


   In order to support setup of the proxy egress RSVP-TE LSP, the new
   Proxy Destination Object is introduced to carry the proxy destination
   address besides that the actual destination address is carried in the
   Session Object.  Both the Session Object and the Proxy Destination
   Object are carried in the RSVP-TE Path message and Resv message to
   set up the proxy egress LSP.

4.  Proxy Destination Object

4.1.  Format

   The Proxy Destination Object is an optional object which may be
   carried in Path or Resv Messages.  The Proxy Destination Class-Number
   is TBD (of form 0bbbbbbb).  RSVP-TE routers that do not support the
   object SHOULD reject the entire message and return an "Unknown Object
   Class" error.

   The format of the Proxy Destination Object is as follows:

   1.  IPv4 Proxy Destination Object

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |             Length            | Class-Num (1) |   C-Type (1)  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                IPv4 Proxy Destination Address                 |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   IPv4 Proxy Destination Address: 32 bits.  IPv4 address of the proxy
   destination address of the proxy egress RSVP-TE LSP.

   2.  IPv6 Proxy Destination Object

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   IPv6 Proxy Destination Address: 16 bytes.  IPv6 address of the proxy
   destination address of the proxy egress RSVP-TE LSP.

   If a message contains multiple Proxy Destination Objects, only the
   first object is meaningful.  Subsequent Proxy Destination Objects
   SHOULD be ignored and SHOULD NOT be propagated.

4.2.  Procedures

   When the ingress node sets up the proxy egress LSP, the Proxy
   Destination Object MUST be inserted in the Path message to indicate
   the address of the proxy destination node that would stitch the proxy
   egress LSP with other LSPs.  When receive the RESV messages, the
   ingress node SHOULD check if the Proxy Destination is included.  If
   the Path message include the Proxy Destination object and the
   corresponding RESV message does not include this object, the ingress
   node MUST treat the Resv message as wrong messages and MUST NOT set
   up LSP.

   On the transit node, when receiving the messages with Proxy
   Destination object, it MUST include the Proxy Destination object in
   the outgoing Path or Resv message without change of the object.  When
   it is necessary for the transit node to calculate the path, the proxy
   destination address identified by the Object MUST be used instead of
   the actual destination address identified by the Session Object.  If
   the transit node receives the Path message including the Proxy
   Destination object but receives the corresponding Resv message which
   does not include this object, it MUST treat the Resv message as wrong
   message can MUST NOT set up LSP.

   On the egress node, when receiving Path messages with Proxy
   Destination object, it MUST include this object in the corresponding
   Resv message.

   TBD.
