Internet-Draft            BGP FSM Error Subcode            February 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines several subcodes for BGP [RFC4271] Finite State
   Machine Error that could provide more information to help network
   operators in diagnosing BGP FSM issues and correlating network
   events.  This information is also helpful to developers in lab
   situations.  This document updates [RFC4271] by requiring BGP
   implementations to insert appropriate FSM Error subcodes in
   NOTIFICATION messages for BGP FSM errors.


2.  Definition of Finite State Machine Error Subcodes

   This document defines following subcodes for BGP Finite State Machine
   Error:

   0 - Unspecific Error

   1 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenSent State

   2 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenConfirm State

   3 - Receive Unexpected Message in Established State


3.  Usage of FSM Error Subcodes

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message (e.g.  KEEPALIVE/
   UPDATE/ROUTE-REFRESH message) on a session in OpenSent state, it MUST
   send to the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code
   Finite State Machine Error and the Error Subcode "Receive Unexpected
   Message in OpenSent State".  The Data field is a 1-octet unsigned
   integer which indicates type of the unexpected message.

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message (e.g.  OPEN/UPDATE/
   ROUTE-REFRESH message) on a session in OpenConfirm state, it MUST
   send to the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code
   Finite State Machine Error and the Error Subcode "Receive Unexpected
   Message in OpenConfirm State".  The Data field is a 1-octet unsigned
   integer which indicates type of the unexpected message.

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message (e.g.  OPEN message)
   on a session in Established state, it MUST send to the neighbor a
   NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Finite State Machine Error
   and the Error Subcode "Receive Unexpected Message in Established
   State".  The Data field is a 1-octet unsigned integer which indicates
   type of the unexpected message.

4.  Security Considerations

   Specification, implementation, and deployment of the proposed BGP FSM
   Error subcodes could make BGP implementation fingerprinting easier
   and probably more accurate.  Operators using BGP need to consider
   this as an operational security consideration of their BGP deployment
   decisions.

   [BFMR2010]discusses a number of BGP security issues and potential
   solutions that might be relevant both to BGP implementers and BGP
   operators.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create the registry "BGP Finite State Machine
   Error Subcodes", within the "BGP Error Subcodes" registry, with a
   Registration Procedure of "Standards Action" as defined in [RFC5226].
   (early allocation of such subcodes is allowed, in accordance with
   [RFC4020])

   The registry should be populated with the following values:

   Value      Name
     0        Unspecified Error
     1        Receive Unexpected Message in OpenSent State
     2        Receive Unexpected Message in OpenConfirm State
     3        Receive Unexpected Message in Established State
