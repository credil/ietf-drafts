Abstract

   The ability of OSPF to transport non-routing information to be used
   by other applications was defined by the Opaque LSA Option.  In order
   to not impact the convergence of routing information, this document
   describes a simple process to incrementally synchronize the routing
   and non-routing information residing in an OSPF link-state database.

Internet-Draft         OSPF Incremental LSDB Sync              July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Opaque LSAs [RFC5250] provide the ability for OSPFv2 [RFC2328] to
   transport non-routing information to be used by other applications.
   A similar capability exists in OSPFv3 [RFC5340] through the use of
   the U-bit and an appropriate LSA Function Code.  Throughout this
   document Opaque LSAs and ones with unrecognized link-state types will
   be referred to simply as "opaque".

   The presence of opaque information in the OSPF Link-State Database
   (LSDB) may result in longer database exchange times, especially in
   cases where the amount of data is significantly larger than the
   routing-specific information.  In order to not impact the convergence
   of routing information, this document describes a simple process to
   incrementally synchronize the information residing in an OSPF LSDB.
   The process uses existing mechanisms.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Incremental LSDB Synchronization Process

   The Incremental LSBD Synchronization (ILS) process consists of the
   following steps:

   LSA Prioritization
           The contents of the local LSDB are classified to determine
           which LSAs require prioritized synchronization.

           In general, LSAs containing routing-specific information MUST
           be classified as requiring prioritized synchronization, while
           other LSAs MAY be classified as not requiring it.

           All routers in the OSPF routing domain should use the same
           criteria for LSA prioritization.  While this is not required
           for correct OSPF operation, it is required for deterministic
           operation of the applications using the opaque LSAs.

   Prioritized LSDB Synchronization
           This step corresponds to the adjacency establishment process
           as described in [RFC2328].

           LSAs classified as not requiring prioritized synchronization
           MUST NOT be included in Database Description (DBD) Packets
           during the Database Exchange Process.  The OSPF routing table
           structure SHOULD be calculated before moving on to the next
           step.

   Final LSDB Synchronization
           In this step, any remaining LSAs in the LSDB SHOULD be
           synchronized.  The routers MUST use the Out-of-Band LSDB
           Resynchronization [RFC4811] (OOB Resync) mechanism, which
           provides a way to resynchronize the LSDB without affecting
           the advertised neighbor state.

   The process is described in terms of LSAs containing (or not)
   routing-specific information, but it may be generalized to include
   any other criteria considered significant in the local network and
   protocol instance.

   The last step in the process MAY be used recursively to achieve an
   incremental LSDB synchronization through different types of data,
   making it also applicable to environments where only non-routing
   information exists.

3.1.  Graceful Restart

   The restart of the OSPF software in a router also presents an
   opportunity for LSDB synchronization.  Because the restarting router
   is still in the forwarding path, it is important for the routing
   information in the LSDB to be synchronized as fast as possible.  ILS
   can be used, with minor modifications, to reduce the synchronization
   time and the probability of network topology changes.

   Graceful OSPF Restart
           Graceful OSPF Restart for OSPFv2 [RFC3623] and OSPFv3
           [RFC5187] don't specify any changes to the adjacency
           establishment process.

           ILS can be used by the Helper Neighbor during the Grace
           Period; if so, then the Helper Node MUST include any Grace-
           LSAs in the DBD Packets during the Prioritized LSDB
           Synchronization step.

   OSPF Restart Signaling
           OSPF Restart Signaling [RFC4812] defines a mechanism to
           inform neighbors about a local restart, in which the LSDB
           synchronization is achieved using OOB Resync.  In other
           words, the Prioritized LSDB Synchronization step would use
           OOB Resync if the non-restarting router uses ILS.  No other

           changes to the process are needed.

3.2.  Flooding and Database Synchronization

   In order to maintain OSPF reliable flooding, separate neighbor
   flooding state must be maintained for the lower priority LSAs and
   used when determining whether a lower priority LSA has been flooded
   or put on a neighbor's retransmission list.

   The rules for flooding lower-priority LSAs and deleting lower
   priority MaxAge LSAs are modified for ILS synchronization.  Neighbor
   state MUST be maintained as to whether low-priority LSAs have been
   synchronized with a given neighbor.  In this document, this lower
   priority state will be referred to as ILS-state.  This ILS-state will
   not advance until a neighbor reaches Full state and will return to
   Down ILS-state should the neighbor fall from Full state.

   If a given neighbor's ILS-state is Exchange or higher, then lower
   priority LSAs should be flooded to that neighbor.  This similar to
   the general LSA flooding rules in Section 13.1 of [RFC2328].

   Consistent with Section 14.1 in [RFC2328], a lower priority MaxAge
   LSA cannot be removed the Link State Database if any the router is in
   Exchange or Loading ILS-state.

   If multiple ILS synchronizations are used for synchronization
   different priorities of LSAs, separate ILS-state MUST be maintained
   for each priority and the previously described rules MUST be applied
   at each priority.


4.  Backward Compatibility

   The operation of ILS depends on the support of OOB Resync during
   synchronization; no backwards compatibility issues exist there
   [RFC4811].  If OOB Resync is not supported by one of the routers,
   then the LSDB synchronization would fall back to the adjacency
   establishment process as described in [RFC2328].

   If OOB Resync is supported, but ILS has not been implemented by all
   the routers involved, the operation is still backwards compatible.
   Note that the process (Section 3) depends on the database description
   by the local router.  In other words, a router may decide to not
   fully describe the contents of its LSDB to its neighbor during the
   adjacency establishment process, and later use OOB Resync to
   incrementally describe the difference; the receiver doesn't need to
   be aware of ILS.  The benefits of ILS may only be partially realized
   if not supported by all the routers involved in synchronization.
