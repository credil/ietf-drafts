Abstract

   In an access LAN of a TRILL campus, the DRB can choose to load share
   the AF responsibility among other RBridges in the LAN. This document
   throws light on one such approach where the AF appointment is fair
   share scheduled among the RBridges.

INTERNET DRAFT          Fair Share AF Load Share         August 29, 2012


1  Introduction

   In a shared access LAN, the appointed forwarder for a VLAN is
   responsible for encapsulating and decapsulating native traffic on
   that VLAN. Other non-AF RBridges in the LAN discard the native
   traffic for that VLAN.

   The DRB can choose to be the AF for all VLANs or load share the AF
   responsibility among other RBRidges in the LAN. This ensures better
   utilization of resources like hardware tables and buffers. The VLAN
   partitioning scheme suggested in [RFC6439] section 2.2.1 is static
   and requires careful configuration. Another simple protocol would be
   to allocate VLANs in a round-robin fashion among all RBridges in the
   LAN. However this doesn't leave scope for schemes like retaining 50%
   of VLANs with the DRB and distribute only the rest among others.

   Fair share scheduling of AF allows for the flexibility of assigning
   certain RBridges (say with higher switching capability) AF for higher
   proportion of VLANs than others.


1.1  Terminology

   This document uses the acronyms defined in [RFC6439].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2  Shares

   Each RBridge is configured with certain quantity of shares. A share
   is the proportion of VLANs which would be allocated to the RBridge in
   comparison with other RBridges. The face value of the shares is a
   relative quantity and makes sense only when taken in conjunction with
   total shares allocated in the LAN.

   These shares are advertised by each RBridge in its hello. The DRB
   load shares the AF among RBridges based on the relative value of
   shares.

   For instance, let A, B and C be three RBridges with S(A) = 2, S(B) =
   1 and S(C) = 1. Then A is assigned the AF for 1/2 of the VLANs while
   B and C the AF for 1/4th of the VLANs each.

   Even when the number of VLANs for which the RBridge is to be AF
   calculates to a non integer value, it should be made sure that there

INTERNET DRAFT          Fair Share AF Load Share         August 29, 2012


   is only one AF for a VLAN in a multi-access LAN.


3  AF Affinity VLAN Set

   Fair share scheduling distributes VLANs among RBridges according to
   proportion of shares allocated. This allows allocation of higher
   proportion of VLANs to certain RBridges (with higher switching
   capability). However, this does not guarantee that these RBridges
   would handle larger share of the native traffic.

   Following the previous example, even though A is appointed AF for 50%
   of the VLANs while B only 25% of the VLANs, the traffic load of VLANs
   for which B is AF could be considerably higher that those in A.

   In order to overcome this conundrum, each RBriged in access LAN is
   configured with an AF Affinity VLAN Set apart form the share
   proportion. This RBridge has AF affinity to the set of configured
   VLANs. Thus when the DRB appoints an RBridge AF for a set of VLANs,
   the members of the set are chosen from the AF Affinity VLAN Set
   advertised.

   Expanding on the previous example, if X denotes an RBridge, let S(X)
   be the shares assigned to X, V(X) be the AF Affinity VLAN Set and
   AF(X) denote the set of VLANs for which X is assigned AF. Let the
   access LAN encompass ten shared VLANs [11, 20]. In this case the AF
   assignment with just the shares configured could be as in Table 1. If
   RBridge A has higher switching capability and VLANs [16, 20] are
   heavily loaded, this AF appointment defeats the purpose.

      +----------------------------------------------------+
      |Table 1: AF appointment using fair share scheduling |
      +--------+-------------+-----------------------------+
      |   X    |     S(X)    |            AF(X)            |
      +--------+-------------+-----------------------------+
      |   A    |     2       |     {11, 12, 13, 14, 15}    |
      +--------+-------------+-----------------------------+
      |   B    |     1       |         {16, 17, 18}        |
      +--------+-------------+-----------------------------+
      |   C    |     1       |          {19, 20}           |
      +--------+-------------+-----------------------------+


   By configuring AF Affinity VLAN set in each RBridge, this difficulty
   can be overcome. Such a configuration is shown in Table 2. How the AF
   Affinity VLAN set is arrived at is beyond the scope of this document.
   Long term traffic planning tools could be helpful in extrapolating a
   decent configuration.

4  AF and VLAN Mapping

   If the DRB detects VLAN mapping, it appoints one RBridge (possibly
   itself) as the AF for all VLANs as suggested in [RFC6439] section 2.4
   to prevent loops.

5  AF and Multiple ports on a link

   The shares configured represents the whole RBridge's proportion of AF
   sought. Further load sharing of AF among multiple ports on same link
   in an RBridge is a local decision.

6  Multi-Topology-Aware Port Capability Sub-TLVs

   Two new Multi-Topology-Aware Port Capability Sub-TLVs are required
   for the purpose of fair share AF appointment - Fair Share Sub-TLV and
   AF Affinity VLAN Set Sub-TLV.

6.1  Fair Share Sub-TLV

   Fair Share Sub-TLV is used to advertise the number of shares
   configured in the RBridge. Number of shares is a two octet value.
   When an RBridge advertises zero shares, it is not assigned any AF.

6.2  AF Affinity VLAN Set Sub-TLV

   AF Affinity VLAN Set Sub-TLV is used to advertise the AF Affinity
   VLAN set configured in an RBridge. It is a facsimile of the Enabled-
   VLANs sub-TLV.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Type      |                  (1 byte)

   | RESV  |  Start VLAN ID        |  (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | VLAN bit-map....
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


6.3  Partial VLANs Appointing Sub-TLV

   As discussed in [RFC6439] section 2.2.3, the size of hello imposes a
   limit on the distribution of AF info in AF Sub-TLV by the DRB. The
   nature of the algorithm means that the AF appointment information
   could be disjoint. If the number of VLANs on a shared link is too
   high, all AF appointments cannot be accommodated in a single hello
   using the start end mechanism of AF Sub-TLV. In such case, the DRB
   should appoint one RBridge (possibly itself) as AF for all VLANs. 

   Alternatively, the AF information can be sent in a bitmap rather than
   start-end mechanism as suggested in AF Sub-TLV. For this purpose the
   Partial VLANs Appointing Sub-TLV suggested in Adaptive VLAN
   Assignment draft [VlanAsn] can be used.

7  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues for IS-IS.


8  IANA Considerations

   This document suggests two additional Sub-TLV to Multi-Topology-Aware
   Port Capability TLV apart from the reuse of Partial VLANs Appointing
   Sub-TLV from Adaptive VLAN Assignment draft.

   o  AF Affinity VLAN Set Sub-TLV
