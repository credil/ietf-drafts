                     The References Header for SIP
                       draft-worley-references-08

Abstract

   This document defines a SIP extension header, References, to be used
   within SIP messages to signify that the message (and the dialog
   containing it) is related to one or more other dialogs.  It is
   expected to be used largely for diagnostic purposes.

1.  Purpose of the References Header

   In many situations, the processing of a SIP "telephone call" involves
   a number of different SIP dialogs.  Of course, the existing SIP
   headers provide adequate information for the SIP elements to carry
   out the needed operations.  But in many cases, it is difficult for an
   observer to identify from a network trace the particular SIP dialogs
   that are involved in one operation.

   For example, if a user agent receives a REFER message within one
   dialog, it sends an INVITE to establish a new dialog which replaces
   the previous one within the user interface of the user agent.  But
   since the connection between the new dialog and the old dialog is
   only realized within the user agent, there is no algorithmic way to
   associate the two dialogs based on the SIP messages alone -- the best
   available technique is to extract all the messages to/from the
   particular user agent, and then observe the INVITE that is sent
   immediately after receipt of the REFER.

Internet-Draft           SIP References header                April 2012


   The purpose of the References header is to allow a SIP message to
   specify that the message carrying it (and by extension, the dialog
   that contains the message) is related to one or more other dialogs,
   specified by their Call-Id values.  Ideally, when given a Call-Id, an
   automated process can use the connections between dialogs specified
   in References headers to determine the entire set of dialogs that are
   needed to understand a complete "telephone call" or other SIP
   interaction.

2.  Syntax and Semantics

   The syntax of the References header is as follows.  (All rules not
   defined here are taken from section 25.1 of RFC 3261[sip].)

   message-header  =/ References
   References      =  "References" HCOLON reference *(COMMA reference)
   reference       =  callid *( SEMI reference-param )
   reference-param =  rel-param / generic-param
   rel-param       =  "rel" EQUAL rel-value
   rel-value       =  "chain" / "inquiry" / "mixed" / "record"
                   /  "refer" / "service" / "sequel" /  "xfer"
                   /  "-chain" / "-inquiry" / "-mixed" / "record"
                   /  "-refer" / "-service" / "-sequel" /  "-xfer"
                   /  gen-value

   Multiple References headers may appear in a SIP message, and their
   values may be combined or separated as allowed by section 7.3 of RFC
   3261[sip].  The ordering of References values is not significant.

   The call-id values of the Replaces and Join headers are considered
   implicit References values and so SHOULD NOT be specified in
   References headers.

   Similarly to the grammar for the Call-ID header, no escaping is
   defined for the call-id value in the References header.

   The presence of a References header in a SIP message means that the
   message (and by implication, the dialog containing it) is related to
   the dialog(s) bearing the specified Call-Id(s).  Note that since
   there is no way to specify the to-tag and from-tag of the referenced
   dialog, the References header does not distinguish different dialogs
   that have the same Call-Id, and all dialogs sharing a Call-Id are
   considered to be related a priori.  The processor of References
   headers should consider the "related" relationship of dialogs to
   include the symmetric-transitive closure of the References
   relationship; that is, if a message in dialog A references dialog B,
   and a message in dialog B references dialog C, then all three dialogs
   should be considered related to each other.

Internet-Draft           SIP References header                April 2012


   The nature of the relationship between the message's dialog and the
   referenced dialog(s) is indicated by the "rel" parameter (if it is
   present).  That is, the dialog containing the message containing the
   References header is related to the dialog with the specified Call-Id
   in the manner specified by the "rel" parameter value, as described
   below.

   Since the message containing the References header is likely to be
   constrained to be generated after the creation of the dialog
   mentioned by the header, and the UA may not have control over this
   time-ordering, each relationship nature defined below implicitly
   defines a reverse relationship, whose "rel" parameter value is
   prefixed with "-", in which the roles of the dialog containing the
   message containing the References header and the dialog specified by
   the callid value in the References header are reversed.  E.g., a
   request with Call-Id A that performs an inquiry to assist in routing
   dialog B may contain

      References: B;rel=inquiry

   but the same meaning can be indicated by a message in dialog B
   containing

      References: A;rel=-inquiry

   The currently defined values of the "rel" parameter are:

      "chain" meaning that this request is the logical continuation of
      the dialog with the specified Call-Id through a B2BUA or the like,
      in that it will carry media that have the same meaning to the user
      ("continuation of the dialog across space")

      "inquiry" meaning that this request was generated to obtain
      information needed to properly process a request with the
      specified Call-Id.  (For example, in section 2.16, "Call Pickup"
      of [service-examples], a SUBSCRIBE is generated to discover the UA
      which sent an INVITE to a designated AOR.)

      "mixed" - indicates that this dialog and the dialog with the
      specified Call-Id are legs of a conference, videoconference, or
      the like, where the media outgoing on each dialog is expected to
      partially duplicate the media incoming on the other dialog, along
      with media incoming on other dialogs

      "join" - this value is permanently reserved so that it may be used
      as a value of cognate data items when describing dialogs related
      by a "Join" header

      "record" - indicates that this dialog carries a copy of the media
      of the dialog with the specified Call-Id

      "refer" - this request was generated due to a REFER with the
      specified Call-Id

Internet-Draft           SIP References header                April 2012


      "replaces" - this value is permanently reserved so that it may be
      used as a value of cognate data items when describing dialogs
      related by a "Replaces" header

      "service" means that this dialog is to obtain "service media" for
      use by the dialog with the specified Call-Id.  "Service media"
      includes music-on-hold, alert tones, and the like.

      "sequel" means that this dialog is the continuation of the
      conversation carried by the dialog with the specified Call-Id
      ("continuation of the dialog across time")

      "xfer" meaning that the dialog of this message and the dialog with
      the specified Call-Id are the two legs of a consultative (or
      attended) transfer.  One endpoint of each dialog will become an
      endpoint of the final dialog (which does not yet exist).

   These values are case-sensitive (although the parameter name, "rel",
   is not).

   The processor of the References header MUST remove any quoting from
   the "rel" parameter value before processing it.  As shown in the
   ABNF, the quoting which may be applied to rel-value is the same as
   what may be applied to a gen-value, specifically, if it is surrounded
   by double-quotes, then any character may be quoted with a backslash.
   Thus the following are all equivalent:

      References: 12345600@atlanta.example.com;rel=xfer

      References: 12345600@atlanta.example.com;rel="xfer"

      References: 12345600@atlanta.example.com;rel="\x\f\e\r"

   It is expected that the References header will usually appear in the
   dialog-forming request of a dialog, but it may appear in any request
   or response.  Since 1xx responses are not delivered reliably, a
   References header value that is present only in a 1xx response may
   not be seen by an element that ought in principle to see the
   response, and such a value SHOULD be present in another message of
   the dialog going to that element.

   The semantics of some "rel" values (e.g., "chain" and "xfer") are
   inherently symmetric; in these cases the "reverse" value, prefixed
   with "-" is still valid, and the processor of the References header
   SHOULD treat the base relationship and the reverse relationship
   identically.

   All parameters and parameter values that are not understood by the
   processor of the References header MUST be ignored.

   Note that while the SIP References header is similar in function to

3.2.  REFER

3.3.  Attended Transfer

   An attended transfer normally involves three different dialogs.  If
   the transfer completes, and the REFER that completes the transfer has
   a References header, the References header in the REFER and the
   Replaces header in the resulting INVITE will suffice to connect the
   three dialogs.  However, to provide complete information if the
   transfer does not complete, the INVITE that establishes the "second
   leg" of the transfer scenario should have a References header naming
   the "first leg".  This example is taken from section 2.5, "Transfer -
   Attended" of [service-examples].

   Note that the executing INVITE F7 does not mention the Call-Id of the
   original INVITE F1 because it is mentioned in the Replaces header.

   If the call pickup operation is done by an agent on behalf of Bill's
   UA (as in the sipXecs open-source PBX), the executing INVITE is
   likely to exist before the SUBSCRIBE is generated.  In that case, the
   SUBSCRIBE will have a References header giving the Call-Id of the
   INVITE:

4.  Practical Experience

   The current version of the sipXecs open-source PBX adds a References
   header to the SUBSCRIBE of a call pickup as described in section
   2.16, "Call Pickup" of [service-examples].  It has caused no observed
   interoperability problem.

5.  Related Work

   This section discusses other Internet-drafts and their relationship
   to this work.

5.1.  draft-loreto-sipping-dialog-correlation

      The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Dialog Correlation[loreto-
      correlation]

   This document defines a new header field for use with SIP.  The Same-
   Session header field is used to logically correlate an existing SIP
   dialog with a new SIP dialog when the media sessions established by
   both dialogs can be considered a single logical session.  This
   mechanism can be used to share the user interface and other resources
   between all the media streams from both sessions.

   The "Same-Session" header prescribes that the media sessions of two
   INVITE dialog usages are to be considered part of the same session
   from the users' points of view.  Because of this semantic, it cannot
   be used in place of the References header, as References can be used
   to express the relationship between two dialogs that are not
   connected in any particular way in regard to user interface.

   However, it would be possible to define a "parallel" value of the
   "rel" parameter to have the semantics of "Same-Session".  This usage
   would require that the References header appears in the INVITE
   establishing the second dialog (and that the two INVITEs are properly
   time-sequenced, or that both INVITEs have a References header).  But
   this still might be considered a conflation of mechanism that have
   different semantics.

5.2.  draft-kaplan-sip-session-id

      A Session Identifier for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP
      )[kaplan-session]

   There are several reasons for having a globally unique session
   identifier for the same SIP session, which can be maintained across
   B2BUA's and other SIP middle-boxes.  This draft proposes a new SIP
   header to carry such a value: Session-ID.

   The semantics of "Session-ID" are close to those of References, and
   it would be reasonable to define a "rel" value that meant that the
   referenced Call-Id was "the other side" of a B2BUA connection.  (This
   would require placing a References header in the INVITE request sent
   from the recipient side of the B2BUA and one in the response to the
   INVITE send from the originator side.) But since References contains
   the real Call-Id of a dialog, this use would not have the security
   properties described in section 5.1 of [kaplan-session].

   A possible solution to this problem is for the B2BUA to create a
   "phantom" Call-Id that is suitably random, and use it in References
   headers sent in both the initial request and response.  By the
   transitivity propertySection 2, the dialogs on both sides of the
   B2BUA are declared to be related, even if the referenced dialog
   contains no messages.

   For two chained B2BUAs with no forking, this would give a message
   flow like this:

   Note that B2BUA 2 does not create a new "References chain" value, but
   rather reuses the value it received in the initial INVITE.  (In
   principle, B2BUA 2 does not need to add References to the response it
   sends, as References is present in the request.)

6.  Security Considerations

   The specification of the relationship between two dialogs could in
   principle be a privacy issue.  But these relationships can usually be
   discerned by heuristic processing of the stream of SIP messages, and
   (with one exception) the author knows of no instance where the
   security or privacy properties of SIP have been based on the
   inability of an eavesdropper to determine that two SIP dialogs or
   messages are related.

Internet-Draft           SIP References header                April 2012


   The one known privacy problem is the the "service provider privacy"
   problem discussed in [kaplan-session].  This situation is different
   from conventional "user security" situations because the eavesdropper
   is assumed to be unable to tap multiple points of the network, and
   the goal is to prevent the eavesdropper from obtaining information
   about parts of the network that the eavesdropper cannot directly
   access.  This sort of privacy can be provided by constructing
   artificial Call-Ids to use in References headers, if References is
   inserted in both requests and responses.
