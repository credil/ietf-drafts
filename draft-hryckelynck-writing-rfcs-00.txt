Abstract

   Mail Accepted by Previous Sending defines a mechanism by which
   incoming unsollicited mails MAY be rejected or penalized by a MTA if
   their sender address domains has never been a destination for the
   outgoing mails treated by this MTA.

1.  Introduction

   Mails with, for example, a pornographic contains are easy to identify
   as mail we MUST intercept.

   But for many other type of mail as, for example, marketing mail, it
   is very difficult to make the difference between a mail user wants to
   receive and a mail he does not want to receive.

   In fact, in a lot of cases, the only difference between sollicited
   and unsollicited mail is the recipient advice.

   With this in mind, it MAY be useful to find a mechanism for users to
   choose themselves who will be able to send them some mails.

   This mechanism SHOULD of course be implemented in a way the users do
   not feel too constrained.

   The mechanism describe below is an attempt to give an answer to this
   problematic.

   Mail Accepted by Previous Sending defines a mechanism by which
   incoming unsollicited mails MAY be rejected or penalized by a MTA if
   their sender address domains has never been a destination for the
   outgoing mails treated by this MTA.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Domain

   The term "domain" use in this document as to be understand as the
   domain part of a SMTP address (user@domain) and MUST be a FQDN as
   describe in the section 2.3.5 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321].

3.  SMTP Philosophy

3.1.  Original SMTP Philosophy

   In the SMTP RFC [RFC5321], you will find a responsability notion.

3.1.1.  responsibility of the client

   As Describe in the section 2.1 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321] :

   "The responsability of an SMTP client is to transfer mail messages to
   one or more SMTP servers, or report its failure to do so".

3.1.2.  responsibility of the server

   As Describe in the section 2.1 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321] :

   "The protocol requires that a server MUST accept responsability for
   either delivering the message or properly reporting the failure to do
   so"

   As Describe in the section 6.1 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321] :

   When the receiver-SMTP accepts a piece of mail (by sending a "250 OK"
   message in response to DATA), it is accepting responsibility for
   delivering or relaying the message.  It must take this responsibility
   seriously.

3.2.  gap is growing with the original Plilosophy

3.2.1.  silent dropping

   Because of the huge quantity of unsollicited mail and to avoid giving
   more information to those whore are sending them, section 6.2 of RFC
   5321 [RFC5321] permit in practice silent dropping and more and more
   MTA are configured to drop silently those mails.

3.3.  How to get back to the original philosophy

3.3.1.  Does the return-path exists ?

   Those past years, efforts has been made to find some ways to check
   the return path as to stay close from the original philosophy
   (deliver or notify).  You of course need a return path in case of
   notify.

   But at this time the RFC 5321 [RFC5321]in section 3.6.2 doesn't
   RECOMMENDED any method.

   A return-path is made of two independant element, the user and the
   domain.  What can be done if we want to check those two elements.

3.3.1.1.  verification of the user part

   User part makes sense only for the MTA which finally deliver the
   mail.

   In the SMTP RFC [RFC5321] the VRFY command permits to ask a MTA about
   the user part.  But to avoid giving more information to those who are
   sending unsolicited mail, the VRFY command has been disabled on most
   MTAs.  The user part of the sender address is therefore uncheckable.

3.3.1.2.  verification of the domain part

   There are four verification levels when checking domain :

   1.  Does the domain exist : First level is to verify if the domain is
       declared in the Internet DNS.  This can be done by a DNS SOA
       Request

   2.  Does the domain has an MX record : Second level is to verify if
       the domain has declared that it can handle mail receiving.  This
       can be done by a DNS MX request.

   3.  Does the domain has a declared MTA : Third level is to verify if
       the answer of the MX request, formerly the name of the server
       which will handle the mails, is properly declared on the Internet
       DNS.  This can be done by a DNS A request.

   4.  Does the MTA is answering : Fourth level is to verify if the
       answer of the A request, formerly the IP address of the MTA, is
       accepting an SMTP connection.  This can be done by a connection
       on the TCP port 25.

   Doing all of these verifications :

   o  Will consume a lot of ressources.  In fact as much work as to send
      a notification (except of the data).

   o  will only prove that all of your correspondant have a fully
      compliant configuration.

   o  Will not be disuasive for people who wants to send you some
      unsollicited mails as the cost to rent an MTA on Internet and to
      get a fully compliant Internet DNS configuration is very cheap and
      can be change regularly.

   Still the only thing that can definitively makes the difference
   between a sollicited and an unsollicited mails is the recipient
   advice.

3.3.2.  Does the return-path has been sollicited ?

3.3.2.1.  situation resume

   Briefly :

   o  We MUST not drop messages without sending notifications.

   o  So there SHOULD be a return path for notifications.

   o  And it MAY be rational to verify this return path validity.

   o  But today we can only check the domain part of the sender address.

   o  And it is a very heavy process.

3.3.2.2.  Mail accepted by previous sending

   To verify the domain and in the same time to be sure the user wants
   to comunicate with this domain we could apply the following
   mechanism.

   When mails are going out :

   o  Take the domain part of the recipient address.

   o  Store it, if not already store, in a base as accepted domains.

   Then when a mail is coming in :

   o  Take the domain part of the sender address.

   o  Check in the base if we have already send some mail to this domain

      *  If the answer is yes, it means some of our users wants to
         communicate with this domain and we accept the mail.

      *  If the answer is no, none of our users has explicitly, by
         sending some mail to it, declared that he wants to communicate
         with this domain and then we MAY reject the mail and send a
         notification.

   This mechanism is fully compliant with the SMTP Philosophy (deliver
   or report).

   As Describe in the section 2.1 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321] : "The protocol
   requires that a server MUST accept responsability for either
   delivering the message or properly reporting the failure to do so"

   And in section 7.9 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321] : "It is a well-established
   principle that an SMTP server may refuse to accept mail for any
   operational or technical reason that makes sense to the site
   providing the server."

   And it has the advantage to give the user the possibility to
   explicitly declare what is for him a sollicited mail.

4.  Identify Previously accepted domain

   As we say previously, acceptation of domain by a user SHOULD :

   o  Be possible in a autonomous way.

   o  Not be time consuming.

   The easiest way is to send an outgoing mail to the domain the user
   wants to accept.

4.1.  Automatically

   When a company wants to implement this mechanism.  It SHOULD be
   possible at the beginning to activate it in a transparent way.

   During a period of time, the "accepted domain" base will be
   automatically filled.

   At the beginning the size of the base will grow up very fast.

   After a while, when the growing of the base will slow down, the MTA
   administrator COULD then :

   o  Communicate to the users the way to accept domain.

   o  Start to reject non previoulsy accepted domain.

4.2.  On demand

   After the mechanism is in service, when user wants to communicate
   with a new domain, they simply send an ougoing mail to this domain.

   As disussed later in section "security considerations" this
   acceptation mail could have specific subject or other specifif header
   value.

   Remark : As users in a same company will share the "accepted domain"
   base, the number of domain to be declared by user would be in most
   cases very small.

4.3.  Directly in the base

   The MTA administrator will of course have the possibility to add a
   domain directly in the base.

5.  Store information about previously accepted domain

   First, it is important to take in consideration that whatever the way
   to store the Information about the "accepted domain" :

   o  This information SOULD be sharable by all MTA in a same company.

   o  The size and format of the fields that will contain "accepted
      domain" MUST be compatible to the size and format as described in
      the section 3.1 of RFC 1035 [RFC1035].

   o  The MTA administrator MUST have the possibility to set directly a
      domain in the base.

5.1.  Use of a dictionnary

   For small companies a Dictionnary MAY be suficient to store the list
   of accepted domains.

5.2.  use of an XML tree

   For an average company, the use of an xml tree to store the list of
   accepted domain SHOULD be more efficient.

   The xml tree SHOULD then be compatible with the structure of the
   Internet domain as described in the RFC 1034 [RFC1034].

   You will find below an example of how the tree may look.

      <root>
         <com>
            <companyname>
               <office>
                  <department>
                  </department>
                  ...
               </office>
               ...
            </companyname>
            ...
         </com>
         <edu>
            <schoolname>
            </schoolname>
            ...
         </edu>
         ...
      </root>

   To limit the size of the tree, administrator SHOULD have the
   possibility to limit the number of subdomain level the system SHOULD
   take in consideration in the tree.

   In the example below the maximum number of level is 2

      <root>
         <com>
            <companyname>
            </companyname>
            ...
         </com>
         <edu>
            <schoolname>
            </schoolname>
            ...
         </edu>
         ...
      </root>

   Fonctionality to configure a wildcard for an entire branch in the
   tree COULD be useful for the MTA administrator.

   The example below show a wildcard for the entire "edu" branch.

      <root>
         <com>
            <companyname>
            </companyname>
            ...
         </com>
         <edu>
            <*>
            </*>
         </edu>
         ...
      </root>

5.3.  Use a Dedicated DNS

   For bigger company, it COULD be interesting to store the information
   about accepted domain in a dedicated DNS.

   The use of a dedicated DNS could offer some interesting possibilities
   to the MTAs administratror like the use of Wildcard to delibaratly

6.  Apply policy to previously or non previously accepted mail

   Of course, "Mail accepted by previous sending" is not the definitive
   solution to get rid of unsollicited mail.  It has to be seen as a
   mechanism that can give useful information.  This information can
   then be used in policy to filter the mails.

6.1.  Offensive policy

6.1.1.  Return a 5.5.0 code

   If the domain has not been previously accepted, and you make the
   choice, based on this information, to reject the mail, you MUST
   return a 5.5.0 code as Describe in the section 3.6.2 of RFC 5321
   [RFC5321].

   Text to be send with the 5.5.0 COULD be for example :

             "550 Your Domain has not been previously accepted"

   Whith this method, it is important to keep a trace in the log of who
   was the recipient of the mail before to reject a mail which comes
   from a non previously accepted domain.  So you SHOULD return a 2.5.0
   code to the "MAIL FROM:" command and then while you have the
   recipient return a 5.5.0 code to the "RCPT TO" command.  As Describe
   in the section 3.3 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321].

   Example :

         S: 220 example-server.com Simple Mail Transfer Service Ready
         C: EHLO example-client.com
         S: 250 example-server.com greets test.com
         C: MAIL FROM:<sender@example-client.com>
         S: 250 OK
         C: RCPT TO:<recipient@example-server.com>
         S: 550 Your Domain has not been previously accepted
         C: QUIT
         S: 221 example-server.com Service closing transmission channel

6.1.2.  Return a 4.5.0 code

   A 4.5.0 code MAY also be used, if you want to keep the message in the
   sender departure queue to let some time to the recipient to accept
   the domain.

6.2.  Defensive policy

   "Defensive Policy" here means, mail that match the policy will not be
   directly rejected.

6.2.1.  Add a header

   A policy can be implemented as follow :

   o  The MTA accept the mail.

   o  And add a "non previously authorized" header in the mail.

   o  Then a rule in the users mail box match the header and put it in
      the junk mail directory.

   Then if the user declare that this mail is not a spam, the domain can
   then be added in the "previously accepted domain" base.

6.2.2.  Promote known Domain

   On MTA which use IP reputation filter, It COULD be interesting to
   implement a fonctionnality that give the possibility to the MTA
   administrator to promote a mail that comes from a domain that has
   been previously accepted.

   For example, if the MTA receive a mail that SHOULD be dropped because
   it comes from an IP which has a bad reputation.  The administrator
   could decide to accept mail with a lower reputation if this mail has
   a sender address with a domain which has been previously accepted.

7.  Which Strategy for which user

   In this part we will talk about what measures SHOULD be taken by, or
   what problems could meet those who wants to implement the "accepted
   by previous sending" mechanism.

7.1.  Private company

7.1.1.  As a sender

7.1.1.1.  to another private company

   If the sender receive a "550 Your Domain has not been previously
   accepted" code, he will clearly know his mail has been rejected and
   he has to contact the recipient to ask him to authorized his domain.

7.1.1.2.  to a commercial site

   As user has to subscribe to receive mail from a commercial site, The
   commercial site will have no difficulty to authorized their
   subscriber domain.  And so the subscriber will be automatically
   authorized to send mail to the commercial site.

7.1.2.  As a receiver

7.1.2.1.  from another private company

   When a user wants to be reached by a new company, he will only have
   to declare the domain.

7.1.2.2.  from a commercial site

   When a user wants to be reached by a commercial site, he will only
   have to declare the domain.  This will force commercial site to
   specify clearly which domain they use for their sending.  This will
   promote commercial site that have a fair marketing policy and will
   penalize other marketing sender which change regularly their sender
   address domain to cross the anti-spam.

7.2.  Public Messagery

7.2.1.  As a sender

7.2.1.1.  to a private company

   As, the domain will be accepted from the moment only one user has
   sent a mail to this domain, big public messagery will be quickly and
   automatically integrated in the company "previously accepted" base.

Internet-Draft      Mail Accepted by Previous Sending         April 2012


7.2.1.2.  to a commercial site

   As user has to subscribe to receive mail from a commercial site, The
   commercial site will have no difficulty to authorized their
   subscriber domain.  And so the subscriber will be automatically
   authorized to send mail to the commercial site.

7.2.2.  As a receiver

7.2.2.1.  from a private company or from a commercial site.

   In this case, the problem is that every user of a public messagery is
   an independant entity and has no relation with other users.

   This means for public messagery that they will have to store separate
   information about accepted domain for each user.  If not, anybody
   could create a mail box and then autorize his domain for all public
   messagery users

   Also, It is very important for public messagery that the user doesn't
   feel constrained in anyway when using one of their mail box.  And
   they cannot impose rules to their users as a private company could
   do.

   Public messagery, if they finally decide to implement such mechanism,
   WOULD probably choose a defensive strategy like :

   o  put the "non accepted" mail in the junk mail directory

   o  accept the domain for the user if he declare a mail from this
      domain is not an unsollicited mail.

7.3.  Commercial site

7.3.1.  As a sender

7.3.1.1.  to a private company

   Today marketing sender who has a fair policy :

   o  Only send mail to users who subscribe.

   o  Send a mail to confirm subsription.

   o  Activate the user account when he click on a web link

   This method COULD not be apply anymore with the "previously accepted
   mail" mechanism.

   Marketing sender will have to ask user to send them a mail to
   activate their account.

   Advantages of such a way to deal with subcription would be :

   o  To have an explicit subsribtion trace of the user.

   o  To autorize only the site on which the user has subscribe and not
      all the other senders to whom the site MAY give your address.

   o  To invite marketing sender to not change anytime their sender
      email address and so to apply the appropriate policy to keep a
      good reputation on their domain.

7.3.1.2.  to another commercial site

   N.A

7.3.2.  As a receiver

7.3.2.1.  from a private company

   As user has to subscribe to receive mail from a commercial site, The
   commercial site will have no difficulty to authorized their
   subscriber domain.  And so the subscriber will be automatically
   authorized to send mail to the commercial site.

7.3.2.2.  from another commercial site

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  IP reputation

   Ip reputation mechanism will still protect you against massive
   sending.  Without these mechanism the domain verification process
   could be a target for Deny of service attack.

8.2.  SPF and DKIM

   It is not garantied, when a mail which has a sender address from a
   domain you previously accepted, that this mail really come from this
   domain.  For this purpose you will need other mechanism that could be
   viewed as complementary like SPF or DKIM

8.3.  Mail analysis

   Mail analysis is still needed, as an identified and authorized domain
   MAY have been temporarly corrupted and MAY send you temporarly
   unsollicited mail.

8.4.  Authentification LDAP

   The possibility you give to user to authorized a domain just by
   sending a mail SHOULD be limited to authentified user.  This
   authentification COULD be for example realized by a request to your
   LDAP server.

8.5.  Add a specific object or header

   The possibility you give to user to authorized a domain just by
   sending a mail COULD be limited to the use of a specific subject or a
   specific header in the mail.

   In this case, an automated fonctionnality SHOULD be implemented in
   the user mail client :

   o  So the authorization of a domain remains easy for the user.

   o  To guarantee the format of the requested subject or header.

8.6.  Blacklist a known domain

   In the case a domain previously accepted by a user is declared as an
   unsollicited mail sender by some other users.  The MTA administrator
   SHOULD have the preemptive possibility to blacklist this domain.
