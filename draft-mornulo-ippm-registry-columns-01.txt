               A(nother) Registry for Performance Metrics
                 draft-mornulo-ippm-registry-columns-01

Abstract

   This memo investigates a scheme to organize registry entries,
   especially those defined in RFCs prepared in the IP Performance
   Metrics (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF, and applicable to all IETF
   metrics.  Three aspects make IPPM metric registration difficult: (1)
   Use of the Type-P notion to allow users to specify their own packet
   types. (2) Use of flexible input variables, called Parameters in IPPM
   definitions, some which determine the quantity measured and others
   which should not be specified until execution of the measurement. (3)
   Allowing flexibility in choice of statistics to summarize the results
   on a stream of measurement packets.  Specifically, this memo proposes
   a way to organize registry entries into columns that are well-
   defined, permiting consistent development of entries over time.
   Also, this fosters development of registry entries based on existing
   reference RFCs for performance metrics, and requires expert review
   for every entry before IANA action.

   This version contains an example registry entry for a passive
   endpoint metric based on RFC7003, an example active metric entry
   based on RFC3393 and RFC5481, and an example pure passive metric
   based on RFC5472.  Also, this version *continues* to allow blank
   entries in columns which have no applicability to a specific metric,
   or class of metrics.  This is preferred to more general registry
   organization because each column serves as a check-list item and
   helps to avoid omissions during registration and expert review.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft          Registry for Perf Metrics           October 2013


1.  Introduction

   This memo investigates a scheme to organize registry entries,
   especially those defined in RFCs prepared in the IP Performance
   Metrics (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF, according to their
   framework [RFC2330].  Three aspects make IPPM metric registration
   difficult: (1) Use of the Type-P notion to allow users to specify
   their own packet types. (2) Use of Flexible input variables, called
   Parameters in IPPM definitions, some which determine the quantity
   measured and others which should not be specified until execution of
   the measurement. (3) Allowing flexibility in choice of statistics to
   summarize the results on a stream of measurement packets.  This memo
   uses terms and definitions from the IPPM literature, primarily
   [RFC2330], and the reader is assumed familiar with them or may refer
   questions there as necessary.

   Although there are several standard templates for organizing
   specifications of performance metrics (see [RFC2679] for an example
   of the traditional IPPM template, based to large extent on the
   Benchmarking Methodology Working Group's traditional template in
   [RFC1242], and see [RFC6390] for a similar template), none of these
   templates was intended to become the basis for the columns of an
   IETF-wide registry of metrics.  As we examine the aspects of metric
   specifications which need to be registered, we will see that none of
   the existing metric templates fully satisfies the needs of a
   registry.

   The authors of [draft-bagnulo-ippm-new-registry] and
   [draft-bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent] made important
   contributions to this memo in the registry column structure, and the
   problem of registry development in general.  We also acknowledge
   input from the authors of [draft-claise-ippm-perf-metric-registry],
   especially the value of an Element ID and the need for naming
   conventions.

1.1.  Background and Motivation

   The motivation for having such registry is to allow a controller to
   request a measurement agent to execute a measurement using a specific
   metric.  Such request can be performed using any control protocol
   that refers to the value assigned to the specific metric in the
   registry.  Similarly, the measurement agent can report the results of
   the measurement and by referring to the metric value it can
   unequivocally identify the metric that the results correspond to.

   There was a previous attempt to define a metric registry RFC 4148
   [RFC4148].  However, it was obsoleted by RFC 6248 [RFC6248] because
   it was "found to be insufficiently detailed to uniquely identify IPPM



Bagnulo, et al.          Expires April 24, 2014                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          Registry for Perf Metrics           October 2013


   metrics... [there was too much] variability possible when
   characterizing a metric exactly" which led to the RFC4148 registry
   having "very few users, if any".

   Our approach learns from this, by tightly defining each entry in the
   registry with only a few parameters open for each.  The idea is that
   the entries in the registry represent different measurement tests,
   whilst the run-time parameters set things like source and destination
   addresses that don't change the fundamental nature of the test.  The
   downside of this approach is that it could result in an explosion in
   the number of entries in the registry.  We believe that less is more
   in this context - it is better to have a reduced set of useful
   metrics rather than a large set of metrics with questionable
   usefulness.  Therefore this document defines that the registry only
   includes commonly used metrics that are well defined; hence we
   require both reference specification required AND expert review
   policies for the assignment of values in the registry.

   There are several side benefits of having such a registry.  First the
   registry could serve as an inventory of useful and used metrics, that
   are normally supported by different implementations of measurement
   agents.  Second, the results of the metrics would be comparable even
   if they are performed by different implementations and in different
   networks, as the metric is properly defined.

   The registry forms part of a Characterization Plan.  It describes
   various factors that need to be set by the party controlling the
   measurements, for example: specific values for the parameters
   associated with the selected registry entry (for instance, source and
   destination addresses); and how often the measurement is made.  The
   Characterization Plan determines the individual Measurement
   Instructions that will be communicated to measurement agents, whose
   task is then to execute the Instruction autonomously.

   Measurement Instructions might look something like: "Dear measurement
   agent: Please start test DNS(example.com) and RTT(server.com,150)
   every day at 2000 GMT.  Run the DNS test 5 times and the RTT test 50
   times.  Do that when the network is idle.  Generate both raw results
   and 99th percentile mean.  Send measurement results to collector.com
   in IPFIX format".  The Characterization Plan depends on the
   requirements of the controlling party.  For instance the broadband
   consumer might want a one-off measurement made immediately to one
   specific server; a regulator might want the same measurement made
   once a day until further notice to the 'top 10' servers; whilst an
   operator might want a varying series of tests (some of which will be
   beyond those defined in the registry) as determined from time to time
   by their operational support system.  While the registries defined in
   this document help to define the Characterization Plan, its full

   specification falls outside the scope of this document, and other
   IETF work as currently chartered.


2.  Scope

   Specifically, this memo proposes a way to organize registry entries
   into columns that are well-defined, permiting consistent development
   of entries over time.  Also, this fosters development of registry
   entries based on existing reference RFCs for performance metrics, and
   requires expert review for every entry before IANA action.

   In this memo, we attempt a combinatoric registry, where all factors
   that can be reasonably specified ARE specified, and changing even one
   factor would require a new registry entry (row).  It is believed that
   this exercise can also be instructive for a registry based on
   independent factors, [draft-bagnulo-ippm-new-registry-independent]
   but that topic is beyond the scope of this effort.

   Entries in the registry must reference an existing RFC or other
   recognized standard, and are subject to expert review.  The expert
   review must make sure that the proposed metric is operationally
   useful.  This means that the metric has proven to be useful in
   operational/real scenarios.


3.  Registry Categories and Columns

   This section briefly describes the categories and columns proposed
   for the registry, as this is likely to be a topic for discussion and
   revision.  Below, categories are described at the 3.x heading level,
   and columns are at the 3.x.y heading level.  The Figure below
   illustrates this organization.

   Taken as a whole, the entries in the columns give a registered
   instance of a metric with sufficient specificity to promote
   comparable results across independent implementations.  In other
   words, a *complete description* of a Metric Instance.  Some instances
   may not require entries in all columns, but this is preferred to more
   general organization because each column serves as a check-list item
   and helps to avoid omissions during registration and expert review.

3.1.  Registry Indexes

   This category includes multiple indexes to the registry entries, the
   element ID and metric name.

3.1.1.  Element ID

   An integer having enough digits to uniquely identify each entry in
   the Registry.

3.1.2.  Metric Name

   A metric naming convention is TBD.

   The current guidance from Section 13 of [RFC2330], where Type-P is a
   feature of all IPPM metric names, is:

   "... we introduce the generic notion of a "packet of type P", where
   in some contexts P will be explicitly defined (i.e., exactly what
   type of packet we mean), partially defined (e.g., "with a payload of
   B octets"), or left generic.  Thus we may talk about generic IP-type-
   P-connectivity or more specific IP-port-HTTP-connectivity.  Some
   metrics and methodologies may be fruitfully defined using generic
   type P definitions which are then made specific when performing

   actual measurements.  Whenever a metric's value depends on the type
   of the packets involved in the metric, the metric's name will include
   either a specific type or a phrase such as "type-P". ..."

   Registry entries are a context where Type-P must be defined.

   IPPM Metric names have also included the typically included the
   stream type, to distinguish between singleton and sample metrics (see
   [RFC2330] for the definition of these terms).

3.2.  Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary
   detalis related to the metric definition, including the RFC reference
   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.

3.2.1.  Reference Definition

   This entry provides references to relevant sections of the RFC(s)
   defining the metric, as well as any supplemental information needed
   to ensure an unambiguous definition for implementations.

3.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   Fixed Parameters are input factors that must be determined and
   embedded in the measurement system for use when needed.  The values
   of these parameters is specified in the Registry.

   Where referenced metrics supply a list of Parameters as part of their
   descriptive template, a sub-set of the Parameters will be designated
   as Fixed Parameters.  For example, Fixed Parameters determine most or
   all of the IPPM Framework convention "packets of Type-P" as described
   in [RFC2330], such as transport protocol, payload length, TTL, etc.

   A Parameter which is Fixed for one Registry entry may be designated
   as a Run-time Parameter for another Registry entry.

3.2.3.  Metric Units

   The measured results of a metric must be expressed using some
   standard dimension or units of measure.  This column provides the
   units (and if possible, the data format, whose specification will
   simplify both measurement implementation and collection/storage
   tasks, see the Output Type column below).

   When a sample of singletons (see [RFC2330] for definitions of these
   terms) is collected, this entry will specify the units for each
   measured value.

Internet-Draft          Registry for Perf Metrics           October 2013


3.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

3.3.1.  Reference Method

   This entry provides references to relevant sections of the RFC(s)
   describing the method of measurement, as well as any supplemental
   information needed to ensure unambiguous interpretation for
   implementations referring to the RFC text.

3.3.2.  Stream Type and Stream Parameters

   Principally, two different streams are used in IPPM metrics, Poisson
   distributed as described in [RFC2330] and Periodic as described in
   [RFC3432].  Both Poisson and Periodic have their own unique
   parameters, and the relevant set of values is specified in this
   column.

   Some metrics, such as those intended for passive monitoring or RTCP
   and RTCP-XR metrics, will not specifiy an entry for this column.

   Each entry for this column contains the following information:

   o  Value: The name of the packet stream scheduling disipline

   o  Stream Parameters: The values and formats of input factors for
      each type of stream.  For example, the average packet rate and
      distribution truncation value for streams with Poisson-distributed
      inter-packet sending times.

   o  Reference: the specification where the stream is defined

   The simplest example of stream specification is Singleton scheduling,
   where a single atomic measurement is conducted.  Each atomic
   measurement could consist of sending a single packet (such as a DNS
   request) or sending several packets (for example, to request a a
   webpage).  Other streams support a series of atomic measurements in a
   "sample", with a schedule defining the timing between each transmited
   packet and subsequent measurement.

3.3.3.  Output Type and Data Format

   For entries which involve a stream and many singleton measurements, a

   a single value.  If the complete set of measured singletons is

   output, this will be specified here.

   Some metrics embed one specific statistic in the reference metric
   definition, while others allow several output types or statistics.

   Each entry in the output type column contains the following
   information:

   o  Value: The name of the output type

   o  Data Format: provided to simplify the communication with
      collection systems and implementation of measurement devices.

   o  Reference: the specification where the output type is defined

   The output type defines the type of result that the metric produces.
   It can be the raw results or it can be some form of statistic.  The
   specification of the output type must define the format of the
   output.  Note that if two different statistics are required from a
   single measurement (for example, both "Xth percentile mean" and
   "Raw"), then a new output type must be defined ("Xth percentile mean
   AND Raw").

3.3.4.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-Time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.  However, the values of these
   parameters is not specified in the Registry, rather these parameters
   are listed as an aid to the measurement system implementor or user
   (they must be left as variables, and supplied on execution).

   Where metrics supply a list of Parameters as part of their
   descriptive template, a sub-set of the Parameters will be designated
   as Run-Time Parameters.

   The Data Format of each Run-time Parameter SHALL be specified in this
   column, to simplify the control and implementation of measurement
   devices.

   Examples of Run-time Parameters include IP addresses, measurement
   point designations, start times and end times for measurement, and
   other measurement-specific information.

3.4.  Comments and Remarks

   Besides providing additional details which do not appear in other
   categories, this open Category (single column) allows for unforeseen

   issues to be addressed by simply updating this Informational entry.


4.  Example RTCP-XR Registry Entry

   This section gives an example registry entry for the passive (end-
   point) metric described in RFC 7003 [RFC7003], for RTCP-XR Burst/Gap
   Discard Metric reporting.

4.1.  Registry Indexes

   This category includes multiple indexes to the registry entries, the
   element ID and metric name.

4.1.1.  Element ID

   An integer having enough digits to uniquely identify each entry in
   the Registry.

4.1.2.  Metric Name

   A metric naming convention is TBD.

4.2.  Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary
   detalis related to the metric definition, including the RFC reference
   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.  Section 3.2 of
   [RFC7003] provides the reference information for this category.

4.2.1.  Reference Definition

   Packets Discarded in Bursts:

   The total number of packets discarded during discard bursts.  The
   measured value is unsigned value.  If the measured value exceeds
   0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an over-
   range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the value
   0xFFFFFF MUST be reported.

4.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   Fixed Parameters are input factors that must be determined and
   embedded in the measurement system for use when needed.  The values
   of these parameters is specified in the Registry.

   Threshold: 8 bits, set to value = 3 packets.




Bagnulo, et al.          Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          Registry for Perf Metrics           October 2013


   The Threshold is equivalent to Gmin in [RFC3611], i.e., the number of
   successive packets that must not be discarded prior to and following
   a discard packet in order for this discarded packet to be regarded as
   part of a gap.  Note that the Threshold is set in accordance with the
   Gmin calculation defined in Section 4.7.2 of [RFC3611].

   Interval Metric flag: 2 bits, set to value 11=Cumulative Duration

   This field is used to indicate whether the burst/gap discard metrics
   are Sampled, Interval, or Cumulative metrics [RFC6792]:

   I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the most
   recent measurement interval duration between successive metrics
   reports.

   I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
   accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

   Senders MUST NOT use the values I=00 or I=01.

4.2.3.  Metric Units

   The measured results are apparently expressed in packets, although
   there is no section of [RFC7003] titled "Metric Units".

4.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.  For the Burst/Gap Discard
   Metric, it appears that the only guidance on methods of measurement
   is in Section 3.0 of [RFC7003] and its supporting references.
   Relevant information is repeated below, although there appears to be
   no section titled "Method of Measurement" in [RFC7003].

4.3.1.  Reference Method

   Metrics in this block report on burst/gap discard in the stream
   arriving at the RTP system.  Measurements of these metrics are made
   at the receiving end of the RTP stream.  Instances of this metrics
   block use the synchronization source (SSRC) to refer to the separate
   auxiliary Measurement Information Block [RFC6776], which describes
   measurement periods in use (see [RFC6776], Section 4.2).

   This metrics block relies on the measurement period in the
   Measurement Information Block indicating the span of the report.
   Senders MUST send this block in the same compound RTCP packet as the
   Measurement Information Block.  Receivers MUST verify that the

Internet-Draft          Registry for Perf Metrics           October 2013


   measurement period is received in the same compound RTCP packet as
   this metrics block.  If not, this metrics block MUST be discarded.

4.3.2.  Stream Type and Stream Parameters

   Since RTCP-XR Measurements are conducted on live RTP traffic, the
   complete description of the stream is contained in SDP messages that
   proceed the establishment of a compatible stream between two or more
   communicating hosts.  See Run-time Parameters, below.

4.3.3.  Output Type and Data Format

   The output type defines the type of result that the metric produces.

   o  Value: Packets Discarded in Bursts

   o  Data Format: 24 bits

   o  Reference: Section 3.2 of [RFC7003]

4.3.4.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-Time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.  However, the values of these
   parameters is not specified in the Registry, rather these parameters
   are listed as an aid to the measurement system implementor or user
   (they must be left as variables, and supplied on execution).

   The Data Format of each Run-time Parameter SHALL be specified in this
   column, to simplify the control and implementation of measurement
   devices.

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].

   SDP Parameters: As defined in [RFC4566]

4.4.  Comments and Remarks

   Besides providing additional details which do not appear in other
   categories, this open Category (single column) allows for unforeseen
   issues to be addressed by simply updating this Informational entry.


5.  Example IPPM Active Registry Entry

   This section gives an example registry entry for the active metric
   described in [RFC3393], on Packet Delay Variation.

5.1.  Registry Indexes

   This category includes multiple indexes to the registry entries, the
   element ID and metric name.

5.1.1.  Element ID

   An integer having enough digits to uniquely identify each entry in
   the Registry.

5.1.2.  Metric Name

   A metric naming convention is TBD.

   One possibility based on IPPM's framework is:

   IP-UDP-One-way-pdv-95th-percentile-Poisson

5.2.  Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary
   detalis related to the metric definition, including the RFC reference
   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.

5.2.1.  Reference Definition

   See sections 2.4 and 3.4 of [RFC3393].  Singleton delay differences
   measured are referred to by the variable name "ddT".

Internet-Draft          Registry for Perf Metrics           October 2013


5.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   Where metrics supply a list of Parameters as part of their
   descriptive template, a sub-set of the Parameters will be designated
   as Fixed Parameters.

   o  F, a selection function defining unambiguously the packets from
      the stream selected for the metric.  See section 4.2 of [RFC5481]
      for the PDV form.

   o  L, a packet length in bits.  L = 200 bits.

   o  Tmax, a maximum waiting time for packets to arrive at Dst, set
      sufficiently long to disambiguate packets with long delays from
      packets that are discarded (lost).  Tmax = 3 seconds.

   o  Type-P, as defined in [RFC2330], which includes any field that may
      affect a packet's treatment as it traverses the network.  The
      packets are IP/UDP, with DSCP = 0 (BE).

5.2.3.  Metric Units

   See section 3.3 of [RFC3393] for singleton elements.

   [RFC2330] recommends that when a time is given, it will be expressed
   in UTC.

   The timestamp format (for T, Tf, etc.) is the same as in [RFC5905]
   (64 bits) and is as follows: the first 32 bits represent the unsigned
   integer number of seconds elapsed since 0h on 1 January 1900; the
   next 32 bits represent the fractional part of a second that has
   elapsed since then.

5.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

5.3.1.  Reference Method

   See section 2.6 and 3.6 of [RFC3393] for singleton elements.

5.3.2.  Stream Type and Stream Parameters

   Poisson distributed as described in [RFC2330], with the following
   Parameters.




Bagnulo, et al.          Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft          Registry for Perf Metrics           October 2013


   o  lambda, a rate in reciprocal seconds (for Poisson Streams). lambda
      = 1 packet per second

   o  Upper limit on Poisson distribution (values above this limit will
      be clipped and set to the limit value).  Upper limit = 30 seconds.

5.3.3.  Output Type and Data Format

   See section 4.3 of [RFC3393] for details on the percentile statistic.

   The percentile = 95.

   Data format is a 32-bit unsigned floating point value.

   Individual results (singletons) should be represented by the
   following triple

   o  T1 and T2, times as described below in the Run-time parameters
      section.

   o  ddT as defined in section 2.4 of [RFC3393]

   if needed.  The result format for ddT is *similar to* the short
   format in [RFC5905] (32 bits) and is as follows: the first 16 bits
   represent the *signed* integer number of seconds; the next 16 bits
   represent the fractional part of a second.

5.3.4.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Where metrics supply a list of Parameters as part of their
   descriptive template, a sub-set of the Parameters will be designated
   as Run-Time Parameters.  In related registry entries, some of the
   parameters below may be designated as Fixed Parameters instead.

   o  Src, the IP address of a host (32-bit value for IPv4, 128-bit
      value for IPv6)

   o  Dst, the IP address of a host (32-bit value for IPv4, 128-bit
      value for IPv6)

   o  T, a time (start of test interval, 128-bit NTP Date Format, see
      section 6 of [RFC5905])

   o  Tf, a time (end of test interval, 128-bit NTP Date Format, see
      section 6 of [RFC5905])

   o  T1, the wire time of the first packet in a pair, measured at
      MP(Src) as it leaves for Dst (64-bit NTP Timestamp Format, see



Bagnulo, et al.          Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft          Registry for Perf Metrics           October 2013


      section 6 of [RFC5905]).

   o  T2, the wire time of the second packet in a pair, measured at
      MP(Src) as it leaves for Dst (64-bit NTP Timestamp Format, see
      section 6 of [RFC5905]).

   o  I(i),I(i+1), i >=0, pairs of times which mark the beginning and
      ending of the intervals in which the packet stream from which the
      measurement is taken occurs.  Here, I(0) = T0 and assuming that n
      is the largest index, I(n) = Tf (pairs of 64-bit NTP Timestamp
      Format, see section 6 of [RFC5905]).

5.4.  Comments and Remarks

   Lost packets represent a challenge for delay variation metrics.  See
   section 4.1 of [RFC3393] and the delay variation applicability
   statement[RFC5481] for extensive analysis and comparison of PDV and
   IPDV.


6.  Example IPFIX RTT Pair Matching Registry Entry

   This section gives an example registry entry for the passive metric
   described in section 2.5.2.1 of [RFC5472], for Round-Trip Time (RTT)
   Measurements with Packet Pair Matching (Single-Point).

6.1.  Registry Indexes

   This category includes multiple indexes to the registry entries, the
   element ID and metric name.

6.1.1.  Element ID

   An integer having enough digits to uniquely identify each entry in
   the Registry.

6.1.2.  Metric Name

   A metric naming convention is TBD.

6.2.  Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary
   details related to the metric definition, including the RFC reference
   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.  Section
   2.5.2.1 of [RFC5472] provides the reference information for this
   category.

Internet-Draft          Registry for Perf Metrics           October 2013


6.2.1.  Reference Definition

   Observations of both directions are required to correlate request/
   response packet pairs.

   Pair matching techniques are described in [Brow00].

6.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   Fixed Parameters are input factors that must be determined and
   embedded in the measurement system for use when needed.  The values
   of these parameters is specified in the Registry.

   Protocol (Pair Type): TCP (SYN/SYN_ACK)

   Note: other possibilities are DNS, ICMP, SNMP or TCP (DATA/ACK),
   discussed in [Brow00].

6.2.3.  Metric Units

   The measured results are expressed in microseconds, which follows the
   format of Information Elements per observed packet, see section 8.4.3
   of[RFC5477] titled "observationTimeMicroseconds".

6.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

6.3.1.  Reference Method

   For the TCP(SYN/SYN_ACK) RTT metric, the guidance on methods of
   measurement is in slides 12 and 15 of [Brow00].

   Recognition of request response pairs is a REQUIRED function, as is
   the correlation of data from both directions of transmission, see
   section 2.5.2.1 of [RFC5472].

   The method requires the collection of the following Information
   Elements per packet:

   o  Packet arrival time: observationTimeMicroseconds, see section
      8.4.3 of[RFC5477]

   o  TCP header: ipPayloadPacketSection, see section 8.5.2 of[RFC5477]

Internet-Draft          Registry for Perf Metrics           October 2013


6.3.2.  Stream Type and Stream Parameters

   Since IPFIX passive Measurements are conducted on live/production
   network traffic, the measurement methods rely on user-generated
   packet flows.  Such flows are not described in this column.

6.3.3.  Output Type and Data Format

   The output type defines the type of result that the metric produces.

   o  Value: RTT in microseconds

   o  Data Format: (There may be some precedent to follow here, but
      otherwise use 64-bit NTP Timestamp Format, see section 6 of
      [RFC5905]).

   o  Reference: Section 2.5.2.1 of [RFC5472]

6.3.4.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.  However, the list of Run-time
   parameters is not specified for purely passive metrics, as there are
   infinite possibilities.

   A likely Run-time parameter is the Destination host, which may be
   given as a Fully-Qualified Domain Name as done in [Brow00], or an IP
   address of the host (32-bit value for IPv4, 128-bit value for IPv6).

6.4.  Comments and Remarks

   Additional (Informational) details for this entry, from [Brow00]:

   Can't get RTT for every packet, only those which are ACKed.

   Overlapping packets (resent) are counted as lost, but not queued.
   This means the first copy of resent packets are used for RTTs, giving
   a high RTT estimate.


7.  Security Considerations

   This registry has no known implications on Internet Security.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Metrics previously defined in IETF were registered in the IANA IPPM
   METRICS REGISTRY, however this process was discontinued when the
   registry structure was found to be inadequate, and the registry was
   declared Obsolete [RFC6248].

   The form of metric registration will finalized in the future, and no
   IANA Action is requested at this time.


9.  Acknowledgements

   The author thanks Brian Trammell for suggesting the term "Run-time
   Parameters", which led to the distinction between run-time and fixed
   parameters implemented in this memo.
