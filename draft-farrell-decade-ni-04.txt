Abstract

   This document defines a set of ways to identify a thing using the
   output from a hash function, specifying URI, URL, binary and human
   "speakable" formats for these names.  The various formats are
   designed to support, but not require, a strong link to the referenced
   object such that the referenced object may be authenticated to the
   same degree as the reference to it.

Internet-Draft          Naming Things with Hashes             April 2012


1.  Introduction

   Names or identifiers are used in various protocols for identifying
   resources.  In many scenarios those names or identifiers contain
   values that are hash function outputs.  However, different
   deployments have chosen various different ways to include hash
   function outputs in such names or identifiers.  This document
   specifies standard ways to do that to aid interoperability.

   Hash function outputs can be used to ensure uniqueness in terms of
   mapping URIs [RFC3986] to a specific resource, or to make URIs hard
   to guess for security reasons.  Since, there is no standard way to
   interpret those strings, today in general only the creator of the URI
   knows how to use the hash function output.  Other protocols, such as
   application layer protocols for accessing "smart objects" in
   constrained environments also require more compact (e.g., binary)
   forms of such identifiers, while in other situations people may have
   to input such values or talk about them, e.g., in a voice call.

   As another example, protocols for accessing in-network storage
   servers need a way to identify stored resources uniquely and in a
   location-independent way so that replicas on different servers can be
   accessed by the same name.  Also, such applications may require
   verifying that a resource representation that has been obtained
   actually corresponds to the name that was used to request the
   resource, i.e., verifying the integrity of the name-data binding.

   Similarly, in the context of information-centric networking
   [ref.netinf-design] [ref.ccn] and elsewhere there is value in being
   able to compare a presented resource against the URI that was
   dereferenced in order to access that resource.  If a
   cryptographically-strong comparison function can be used then this
   allows for many forms of in-network storage, without requiring as
   much trust in the infrastructure used to present the resource.  The
   outputs of hash functions can be used in this manner, if presented in
   a standard way.

   Additional applications might include creating references from web
   pages delivered over HTTP/TLS; DNS resource records signed using
   DNSSEC or data values embedded in certificates, Certificate
   Revocation Lists (CRLs), or other signed data objects.

   The new URI scheme defined here allows for the use of a query-string,
   similar to how query-strings are used in HTTP URLs.  A companion
   specification [niexts] describes specific values that can be used in
   such query strings for various purposes and other extensions to this
   basic format specification.

Internet-Draft          Naming Things with Hashes             April 2012


   The "ni" URI scheme defined here is very similar to the "magnet link"
   informally defined in various other protocols. [magnet]

   In addition to the URI form we also define a ".well-known" URL
   equivalent, and a way to include a hash as a segment of an HTTP URL,
   as well as a binary format for use in protocols that require more
   compact names and a human-speakable text form that could be used,
   e.g. for reading out (parts of) the name over a voice connection.

   Not all uses of these names require use of the full hash output -
   truncated hashes can be safely used in some environments.  For this
   reason, we define a new IANA registry for hash functions to be used
   with this specification so as not to mix strong and weak (truncated)
   hash algorithms in other protocol registries.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Syntax definitions in this memo are specified according to ABNF
   [RFC5234].


2.  Basics

   This section contains basic considerations common to all formats.

   When verifying whether two names refer to same object, an
   implementation MUST only consider the digest algorithm identifier and
   the digest value, i.e., it MUST NOT consider the authority field from
   a URI or any parameters and MUST consider two hashes identical
   regardless of encoding, if they encode the same binary value, and are
   the same length.

   The sha-256 algorithm as specified in [RFC4055] is mandatory to
   implement, that is, implementations MUST be able to generate/send and
   to accept/process names based on a sha-256 hash.  However
   implementations MAY support additional hash algorithms and MAY use
   those for specific names, for example in a constrained environment
   where sha-256 is non-optimal or where truncated names are needed to
   fit into corresponding protocols (when a higher collision probability
   can be tolerated).

   Truncated hashes MAY be supported if needed.  When a hash value is
   truncated the name MUST indicate this.  Therefore we use different
   hash algorithm strings for these, such as sha-256-32 for a 32-bit
   truncation of a sha-256 output.  (Note that a 32-bit truncated hash
   is essentially useless for security but might be useful for naming.)

Internet-Draft          Naming Things with Hashes             April 2012


   When a hash value is truncated to N bits the left-most or most
   significant in network byte order N bits from the binary
   representation of the hash value MUST be used as the truncated value.
   An example of a 128-bit hash output truncated to 32 bits is shown in
   Figure 1.


              128-bit hash: 0x265357902fe1b7e2a04b897c6025d7a2
     32-bit truncated hash: 0x26535790

                    Figure 1: Example of Truncated Hash

   When the input to the hash algorithm is a public key value, as may be
   used by various security protocols, the hash SHOULD be calculated
   over the public key in an X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure
   (Section 4.1 of [RFC5280]).  This input has been chosen primarily for
   compatibility with DANE [I-D.ietf-dane-protocol], but also includes
   any relevant public key parameters in the hash input, which is
   sometimes necessary for security reasons.  Note also that this does
   not force use of X.509 or full compliance with [RFC5280] since
   formatting any public key as a SubjectPublicKeyInfo is relatively
   straightforward and well supported by libraries.

   Any of the formats defined below can be used to represent the
   resulting name for a public key.

   Other than in the above special case where public keys are used, we
   do not specify the hash function input here.  Other specifications
   are expected to define this.


3.  Named Information (ni) URI Format

   A Named Information (ni) URI consists of the following components:

   Scheme Name [Required]  The scheme name is 'ni'.

   Colon and Slashes [Required]  The literal "://"

   Authority [Optional]  The optional authority component may assist
      applications in accessing the object named by an ni URI.  Note
      that while the ni names with and without an authority differ
      syntactically, both names refer to the same object if the digest
      algorithm and value are the same.

Internet-Draft          Naming Things with Hashes             April 2012


   One slash [Required]  The literal "/"

   Digest Algorithm [Required]  The name of the digest algorithm, as
      specified in the IANA registry defined in Section 9.4 below.

   Separator [Required]  The literal ";"

   Digest Value [Required]  The digest value encoded in the specified
      encoding.

   Query Parameter separator [Optional] '?'  The query parameter
      separator acts a separator between the digest value and the query
      parameters (if specified).

   Query Parameters [Optional]  A tag=value list of optional query
      parameters as are used with HTTP URLs.

   It is OPTIONAL for implementations to check the integrity of the URI/
   resource mapping when sending, receiving or processing "ni" URIs.

   The digest value MUST be encoded using base64url [RFC4648] encoding.

   The query segment of a URI is NOT hierarchical.  Thus escape encoding
   of slash '/' characters is NOT required.  Since application code
   often attempts to enforce such encoding, decoders MUST recognize the
   use of URI escape encoding (e.g., '%2f' or '%2F' for the slash
   character).  Section 3.4 of [RFC3986] states that "The characters
   slash ("/") and question mark ("?") may represent data within the
   query component."

   Consequently no special escaping mechanism is required for the query
   parameter portion of ni URIs.  URI escaping is however frequently
   imposed automatically by scripting environments.  Thus to ensure
   interoperability, implementations SHOULD NOT generate URIs that
   employ URI character escaping, and implementations MUST NOT reject
   any URIs that employ URI character escaping.

   The Named Information URI has the following syntax:

         niname ="ni://" [ authority ] "/" algval [ "?" query ]
         algval = alg ";" val
         alg = 1*unreserved
         val = 1*unreserved
         unreserved  = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"

                         Figure 2: ni Name syntax

   Note that "unreserved" is defined in the URI specification [RFC3986]

Internet-Draft          Naming Things with Hashes             April 2012


   Section 2.3, in the way shown above.  The "authority" and "query"
   types are also from the URI specification.  [RFC3986]

   The "val" field MUST contain the output of applying the hash function
   ("alg") to its defined input, which defaults to the object bytes that
   are expected to be returned when the URI is dereferenced.


4.  .well-known URL Format

   We define a mapping between URIs following the ni URI scheme and HTTP
   or HTTPS URLs that makes use of the .well-known URI [RFC5785] by
   defining an "ni" suffix (see Section 9).

   The HTTP(S) mapping MAY be used in any context where clients without
   support for ni URIs are needed without loss of interoperability or
   functionality.

   For an ni name of the form "ni://n-authority/alg;val?query-string"
   the corresponding HTTP(S) URL produced by this mapping is
   "http://h-authority/.well-known/ni/alg/val?query-string", where
   "h-authority" is derived as follows: If the ni name has a specified
   authority (i.e., the n-authority is non-empty) then the h-authority
   MUST have the same value.  If the ni name has no authority specified
   (i.e. the n-authority string is empty), a h-authority value MAY be
   derived from the application context.  For example, if the mapping is
   being done in the context of a web page then the origin [RFC6454] for
   that web site can be used.  Of course, there are in general no
   guarantees that the object named by the ni URI will be available at
   the corresponding HTTP(S) URL.  But in the case that any data is
   returned, the retriever can determine whether or not it is content
   that matches the ni URI.

   If an application is presented with a HTTP(S) URL with "/.well-
   known/ni/" as the start of its pathname component, then the reverse
   mapping to an ni URI either including or excluding the authority
   might produce an ni URI that is meaningful, but there is no guarantee
   that this will be the case.

   When mapping from a ni URI to a .well-known URL, an implementation
   will have to decide between choosing an "http" or "https" URL.  If
   the object referenced does in fact match the hash in the URL, then
   there is arguably no need for additional data integrity, if the ni
   URI or .well-known URL was received "securely."  However TLS also
   provides confidentiality, so there may still be reasons to use the
   "https" URL scheme even in this case.  In general however, whether to
   use "http" or "https" is something that needs to be decided by the
   application.

5.  URL Segment Format

   Some applications may benefit from using hashes in existing HTTP URLs
   or other URLs.  To do this one simply uses the "algval" production
   from the ni name scheme ABNF which may be included in the pathname
   component of HTTP URLs.  In such cases there is nothing present in
   the URL that ensures that a client can depend on compliance with this
   specification, so clients MUST NOT assume that any URL with a
   pathname component that matches the "algval" production was in fact
   produced as a result of this specification.  That URL might or might
   not be related to this specification, only the context will tell.


6.  Binary Format

   When a more space-efficient version of the name is needed, we can use
   a binary format.  The binary format name consists of two fields: a
   header and the hash value.  The header field defines how the
   identifier has been created and the hash value contains a (possibly
   truncated) result of a one-way hash over whatever is being identified
   by the hash value.  The format of the binary representation of a name
   is shown in Figure 3.


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |Res| Suite ID  |              Hash Value                       /
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       /                             ...                               /
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       /      ...      |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                       Figure 3: Binary Name Format

   The Res field is a reserved 2-bit field for future use and MUST be
   set to zero for this specification.

   The hash algorithm and truncation length are specified by the Suite
   ID.  For maintaining efficient encoding for the binary presentation,
   only a few hash algorithms and truncation lengths are supported.  See
   Section 9.4 for details.

   Note that a hash value that is truncated to 120 bits will result in
   the overall name being a 128-bit value which may be useful with
   certain use-cases.

7.  Human-readable Format

   Sometimes the name may need to be used in a format that is easy for
   humans to read and possibly communicate, for example, over the phone.
   For this purpose, the following more verbose but less ambiguous (when
   spoken) URI format is defined with scheme name "nih", standing for
   "Named Information for Humans."  (Or possibly "Not Invented Here,"
   which is clearly false, and therefore worth including :-)

   As with the ni URI format, nih URI fields are separated by a semi-
   colon (;) character.  The first field is a hash algorithm string, as
   in the ni URI format.  Then the hash value is encoded using ASCII hex
   characters and lower-case alphabet.

   The hash value is OPTIONALLY followed by a checksum.  The checksum
   MUST be calculated as a crc16 over the following parts (encoded as
   UTF-8 [RFC3629]): the URI scheme and separator ("nih:"), the
   algorithm string, the first delimiter, (";") the hash value, and the
   second delimiter (also ";").  The 16-bit result of the crc16 is
   encoded using network byte order and, like the hash value, with
   lower-case ASCII hex characters.

   The crc16 MUST use the CRC-CCITT polynomial: x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1.

         humanname = "nih:" algval [ ";" checksum ]
         algval = alg ";" val
         alg = 1*unreserved
         val = 1*unreserved
         checksum = 1*unreserved

                      Figure 4: Human-readable syntax

   For algorithms that have a Suite ID reserved (see Figure 7), the alg
   field MAY contain the ID value as a UTF-8 encoded decimal number
   instead of the hash name string (for example, "3" instead of "sha-
   256-120").  Implementations MUST be able to match the decimal ID
   values for the algorithms and hash lengths that they support even if
   they do not support the binary presentation.  Note that using the
   decimal presentation instead of the hash name string results in a
   different checksum for the same name.


8.  Examples

   The following ni URI references the text "Hello World!" (without the
   quotes, being 12 characters), using the sha-256 algorithm and no
   authority field:

   ni:///sha-256;A7ogTlDRJuRnTABeBNguhMITZngK8fQ71Uo3gWtqs0A

   And the same example shown with an authority would be:

   ni://example.com/sha-256;A7ogTlDRJuRnTABeBNguhMITZngK8fQ71Uo3gWtqs0A

   The following HTTP URL represents a mapping from the previous ni name
   based on the algorithm outlined above.

   http://example.com/.well-known/ni/sha-256/
   A7ogTlDRJuRnTABeBNguhMITZngK8fQ71Uo3gWtqs0A

   Given the SubjectPublicKeyInfo in Figure 5 we derive the names shown
   in Figure 6 for this value.

9.4.  Hash Name Algorithm Registry

   IANA is requested to create a new registry for hash algorithms as
   used in the name formats specified here.  This registry has four
   fields, the binary suite ID, the hash algorithm name string, the
   truncation length and the underlying algorithm reference.  Future
   assignments are to be made through expert review [RFC5226].  Initial
   values are specified below.

   Since there are only 63 possible binary suite ID field values allowed
   by the binary format specified here, the suite ID field value is
   OPTIONAL.  Where the binary format is not expected to be used for a
   given hash algorithm, this field SHOULD be omitted.



            ID  Hash name string     Value length     Reference
            0   Reserved
            1   sha-256              256 bits         [RFC4055]
            2   sha-256-128          128 bits         [RFC4055]
            3   sha-256-120          120 bits         [RFC4055]
            4   sha-256-96           96 bits          [RFC4055]
            5   sha-256-64           64 bits          [RFC4055]
            6   sha-256-32           32 bits          [RFC4055]
            32  Reserved

                        Figure 7: Suite Identifiers

   The Suite ID value 32 is reserved for compatibility with ORCHIDs
   [RFC4843].  The referenced hash algorithm matching to the Suite ID,
   truncated to the length indicated, according to the description given
   in Section 2, MUST be used for generating the hash.


10.  Security Considerations

   No secret information is required to generate or verify a name of the
   form described here.  Therefore a name like this can only provide
   evidence for the integrity for the referenced object and the proof of
   integrity provided is only as good as the proof of integrity for the
   name from which we started.  In other words, the hash value can
   provide a name-data integrity binding between the name and the bytes

   returned when the name is de-referenced using some protocol.

   Disclosure of a name value does not necessarily entail disclosure of
   the referenced object but may enable an attacker to determine the
   contents of the referenced object by reference to a search engine or
   other data repository or, for a highly formatted object with little
   variation, by simply guessing the value and checking if the digest
   value matches.  So the fact that these names contain hashes does not
   protect the confidentiality of the object that was input to the hash.

   The integrity of the referenced content would be compromised if a
   weak hash function were used.  So don't use those.  SHA-256 is
   currently our preferred hash algorithm which is why we've only added
   SHA-256 based suites to the initial IANA registry.

   If a truncated hash value is used, certain security properties will
   be affected.  In general a hash algorithm is designed to produce
   sufficient bits to prevent a 'birthday attack' collision occurring.
   To ensure that the difficulty of discovering two pieces of content
   that result in the same digest with a work factor O(2^x) by brute
   force requires a digest length of 2x.  Many security applications
   only require protection against a 2nd pre-image attack which only
   requires a digest length of x to achieve the same work factor.
   Basically, the shorter the hash value used, the less security benefit
   you can possibly get.
