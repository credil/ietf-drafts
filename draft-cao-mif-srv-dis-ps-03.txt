Abstract

   This document analyzes the problems of service discovery in a
   multiple connection environment.  A multiple connection environment
   consists of multiple-interfaced nodes connecting to multiple networks
   or multiple provisioning domains.  Given a type of service a
   multiple-interfaced client is looking for, the discovery progress
   ought to return a correct pointer to the service instance that the
   client is able to access without trying every available channel.

1.  Introduction

   A multihomed host has multiple provisioning domains via physical and/
   or virtual interfaces.  A multihomed host receives node configuration
   information from each of its access networks, through various
   mechanisms such as DHCP, PPP and IPv6 Router Advertisements.  When
   the received node-scoped configuration objects have different values
   from each administration domains, such as different DNS servers IP
   addresses, different default gateways or different address selection
   policies, the node has to decide which it will use or how it will
   merge them.

   Issues regarding how the multi-homed host uses the configuration
   objects have been addresses in [RFC6418].  Current practices of how
   the various implementations handle these problems are introduced in
   [RFC6419].  [RFC6731] extends DHCPv6 to inform the host which DNS
   server it ought to select to send the query request, and DNS based
   Service Discovery (DNS-SD) has been specified in [RFC6763].

   This document analyzes the problem of service discovery in a multiple
   connection environment.  A multiple connection environment consists
   of multiple-interfaces nodes connecting to multiple networks or
   multiple provisioning domains.  Given a type of service a multiple-
   interfaced client is looking for, the discovery progress ought to
   return a correct pointer to the service instance that the a client is
   able to access.

2.  Requirements and Terminology

2.1.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   Service Domain

      A set of services that can be accessed by users.  Besides
      providing services, a service domain is responsible for delivering
      configuration and pointers that ensure a guaranteed service
      access.

   Service Discovery

      Procedure to acquire information that is necessary to access
      service.

   Multiple Connection Environment

      Consists of multiple-interfaced nodes that connect to multiple
      networks or multiple provisioning domains.

3.  Scenarios

   We describe two scenarios in this section, one related to Multiple
   Interfaces, and the other one related to Home Networks (homenet).

3.1.  Mif Scenario

   The service discovery process can be summarized as the following five
   steps.

   1.  Service Discovery Preparation: the host determines which
       interface it should send a query request based on the
       configuration information.

   2.  Service Query Request: the host sends a query request to find a
       service.  The query should include a description of the service,
       for example, a full-qualified domain name, a URI, or an
       application-specific naming of the service.

   3.  Service Request Handling: any entity that receives the query
       request should handle the request.  The entity should understand

Internet-Draft              MIF SRV Discovery                August 2013


       the meaning of the request, and check the semantics of the
       request language before giving an answer back.

   4.  Service Query Response: the entity that receives the query
       request should reply with an answer to the query.  The answer
       should include a pointer to the service.

   5.  Service Access: the host accesses the service via the pointer
       provided in the query response.  The host is supposed to be able
       to get the service instance via the pointer under a successful
       and efficient service discovery mechanism, unless the servers in
       such service domain encounter problems e.g. a web server is down.

   Figure 1 shows a typical scenario for service discovery in a multiple
   connection environment.  It is common in today's mobile Internet that
   a host is equipped with multiple network interfaces.  On the service
   domain, different services are deployed and some services may not be
   accessible to a certain interface on the host due to security concern
   or access policy.  The connectivity each interface provides may not
   be restricted to Internet access.  For instance, WLAN and bluetooth
   can offer direct access to potential services e.g. printers via local
   ad-hoc connectivity.  In such multiple connection environment, the
   service discovery process should return a correct point to the host
   and ensure that the host can access the service via this pointer.
   This situation makes the multiple interface service discovery
   different from the typical one-interface Internet access scenario.
   Furthermore, the growing usage of IPv6 in the homenet environment has
   made service discovery more challenging that requires thorough
   investigation.

    Figure 1: Multiple Interface Host with Multiple Available Services

3.2.  Homenet Scenario

   We also describe the issues related to the homenet architecture
   [I-D.ietf-homenet-arch], as depicted in Figure 2.

   Suppose one MIF host is connected to three domains: homenet domain,
   3gpp domain and a WiFi or enterprise domain.  There is one service
   that is named with the private domain name, say 'temperature.ietf',
   which is only resolvable via the domain name service residing inside
   the homenet and is supported by the multicast dns service [RFC6762].

   There are several problems in this scenario.  First of all, since the
   host has two unicast dns domains configured over the 3GPP and WiFi,
   and as well as a multicast service discovery domain within the
   homenet, the host does not know which domain it should send a dns
   resolution request.  Secondly, even if coupled with the split dns
   solution [RFC6731], the configuration information obtained from DHCP
   supports only those two unicast dns domains, but not the homenet
   domain which is normally considered as 'zero-configuration'.  Third,
   the service discovery problem will become more complicated if the
   host is connecting to more than one home networks, i.e., multiple
   multicast dns domains.

4.  Problem Analysis

   The problems that a multiple-interfaced host may meet during the
   service discovery include:

   1.  How the query requests are sent?  Because there are multiple
       interfaces available and multiple service rendezvous existing,



Cao & Ding              Expires February 28, 2014               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              MIF SRV Discovery                August 2013


       the host should decide which destination it ought to send the
       query to.  And if there is a round-robin mechanism, the host
       should determine the order of the query request.

   2.  How to handle the query and reply?  Some pointers to the service
       are restricted to a local scope or a certain interface, e.g., an
       office printer may not be accessible to the 3G-interface.  The
       service discovery process is supposed to return a pointer that is
       accessible to the host.

   3.  How to access the service?  Given the pointer to the service, the
       host should be able to determine from which interface it can
       access the service.

   The existing work of [RFC6418] and [RFC6419] have covered the general
   problems encountered by hosts accessing multiple provisioning
   domains, but the focus is on connectivity and configuration.
   Proposal of Happy Eyeball in [I-D.ietf-mif-happy-eyeballs-extension]
   allows a host with multiple interfaces to pick a suitable one for
   access and enables automatic fallback.  In a DNS based service
   discovery [RFC6763], the problem of domain split is analyzed in the
   [RFC6731].  The document defines an extension to the DHCPv4 and
   DHCPv6 to inform the MIF host which domain scope the Recursive DNS
   Server(RDNSS) is serving for, so that the "service query request" can
   be sent to the correct RDNSS to get an answer.

   The existing proposals resolve the partial problem in the service
   discovery process mentioned above.  To highlight the missing blocks,
   Figure 3 provides a 'gap' analysis.  In the figure, we compare three
   existing solutions on service discovery, DNS-SD[RFC6763], DNS-Server-
   Selection [RFC6731], and MIF Happy Eyeball
   [I-D.ietf-mif-happy-eyeballs-extension], from three aspects as
   mentioned above.  The DNS-Srv-Sel solution uses the defined DHCP
   option for the MIF host to select the corresponding DNS Server, and
   MIF-HE inherits this method in its most updated version.  The MIF-HE
   can help host failover to the workable interface during service
   access while DNS-Srv-Sel does not handle this particular issue.  The
   DNS-SD is not designed for a multiple interfaces environment and DNS
   server selection and request handling are based on standard DNS
   behaviors.

       Figure 3: Gap Analysis of Existing Service Discovery Methods

   In a complicated network as shown in Figure 4 , the host connects to
   the enterprise network via the wired interface, a WLAN network with
   the 802.11 interface, and an operator's network via the cellular
   interface.  The three intranets have their own Firewall policies to
   the global Internet.  On the enterprise network, many outgoing ports
   are restricted, and on the WLAN and operator's public network, there
   is more freedom.  If the MIF host makes a DNS-SRV query to a service
   in a global domain, all the RDNS servers have the corresponding
   records.  But say the service port number has been blocked by the
   enterprise network administrator, the DNS has no such information.
   Even if the DNS returns a pointer to the MIF host, the MIF host
   cannot access this service via the wired interface.

   CoAP [I-D.ietf-core-coap] is an IETF designed RESTful protocol for
   constrianed environment.  CoAP defines a link-format for service
   discovery of the particular CoAP server, i.e., "/.well-known/core".
   If the CoAP client has multiple access networks as shown in Figure 5,
   the situation turns to be more complex.  For instance, if the MIF
   client wants to find a humidity sensing resource, but does not know
   which domain contains the information, it basically needs to send
   multiple CoAP GET requests with the well-known URL.  Once it gets a
   response for the required resource, it can send the corresponding
   request to get the information.  However this way is sub-optimal
   especially for constrained devices.  MIF service discovery SHOULD
   consider the efficiency of the service discovery process.

   As a summary of the above analysis, the general problems and
   requirements of service discovery in a MIF environment can be
   summarized as follows:

   Service Directory Service Configuration:   Service directory is the
      entity that stores or can get the stored relationship between
      service names and service pointers.  Different interfaces or
      provisioning domains have their different service directories.
      How to configure them on the MIF host and how the MIF host
      utilizes the configured information are important for the service
      discovery process to behave correctly.

   Service Directory Selection:   After the service directory
      information is configured on the host, the host is able to select
      the correct directory to send the query.  The host can utilize
      auxiliary information available or send the query to all the
      directories that have been configured.  The behavior of MIF host
      to select a correct directory is also important for a stable
      system.

   Service Pointer/Address Resolution:  The same service may have
      different available addresses and pointers, and some service has
      limited connectivity.  So the resolution process should be able to
      return to the MIF host a record that is accessible from at least
      one of the interfaces.  Efficiency SHOULD be taken into
      consideration in this phase.

   Service Route Selection:  With the pointers returned, the host should
      route the service level data to the service instance identified by
      the returned pointers.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA requests.

6.  Security Considerations

   The query response exchanges should be protected by security
   mechanisms.  If the response contains invalid information, e.g. a
   pointer to a worm website, it harms.  As a consequence, the service
   discovery should protect bogus information injected by attackers or
   intruders.  The security consideration ought to be made by the
   underlining protocols, and it is out the scope of this problem
   statement document.
