<abstract>

<t>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based,
language-independent data interchange format.  It was derived from
the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard.  JSON defines a small
set of formatting rules for the portable representation of structured
data.</t>

</abstract>

<section title="Introduction">

<t>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a text format for the
serialization of structured data.  It is derived from the object
literals of JavaScript, as defined in the ECMAScript Programming
Language Standard, Third Edition <xref target="ECMA-262"/>.</t>

<t>JSON can represent four primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans,
and null) and two structured types (objects and arrays).</t>

<t>A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters <xref target="UNICODE"/>.</t>

<t>An object is an unordered collection of zero or more name/value
pairs, where a name is a string and a value is a string, number,
boolean, null, object, or array.</t>

<t>An array is an ordered sequence of zero or more values.</t>

<t>The terms "object" and "array" come from the conventions of
JavaScript.</t>

<t>JSON's design goals were for it to be minimal, portable, textual, and
a subset of JavaScript.</t>

<section title="Conventions Used in This Document">

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>

<t>The grammatical rules in this document are to be interpreted as
described in <xref target="RFC4234" />.</t>

</section>

<section title="Specifications of JSON">
<t>A description of JSON in ECMAScript terms first appeared in version 5.1 of
the ECMAScript specification <xref target="ECMA-262" />, section 15.12.
It includes a description of the differences between JSON as described in
that specification and in RFC4627.
The most significant is that ECMAScript 5.1 does not require
a JSON Text to be an Array or an Object; thus, for example, "Hello world!",
"42", and "true" would all be valid JSON texts in the ECMAScript 5.1
context.</t> 
<t>JSON is also described in <xref target="ECMA-404" />.</t>
<t>None of the specifications of JSON syntax disagree on the syntax of
the language.</t>

</section>

<section title="Introduction to This Revision">
<t>In the years since the publication of RFC 4627, JSON has found very wide 
use. This experience has revealed certain patterns
which, while allowed by its specifications, have caused interoperability
problems.</t>
<t>Also, a small number of errata have been reported.</t>
<t>This revision does not change any of the rules of the specification; all 
texts which were legal JSON remain so, and none which were not JSON become
JSON.  The revision's goal is to fix the errata and highlight practices
which can lead to interoperability problems.</t>
</section>

<section title="Changes from RFC 4627">

<t>This section lists all changes between this document
and the text in RFC 4627.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">

<t>Made a real "Security Considerations" section, and lifted the
text out of the existing "IANA Considerations" section.</t>

<t>Applied erratum #3607 from RFC 4627 by removing the security consideration
that begins "A JSON text can be safely passed" and the JavaScript code that
went with that consideration.</t>

<t>Added a note to the "Security Considerations" section pointing out the
risks of using the "eval()" function in JavaScript or any other language in
which JSON texts conform to that language's syntax.</t>

<t>Moved the ECMAScript reference from Normative to Informative, updated
it to reference ECMAScript 5.1, and added reference to ECMA 404.</t>

</section>

<section title="JSON Grammar">

<t>A JSON text is a sequence of tokens.  The set of tokens includes six
structural characters, strings, numbers, and three literal names.</t>

<t>A JSON text is a serialized object or array.</t>

<figure><artwork>
   JSON-text = object / array
</artwork></figure>

<t>These are the six structural characters:</t>

<figure><artwork>
   begin-array     = ws %x5B ws  ; [ left square bracket

   begin-object    = ws %x7B ws  ; { left curly bracket

   end-array       = ws %x5D ws  ; ] right square bracket

   end-object      = ws %x7D ws  ; } right curly bracket

   name-separator  = ws %x3A ws  ; : colon

   value-separator = ws %x2C ws  ; , comma
</artwork></figure>

<t>Insignificant whitespace is allowed before or after any of the six
structural characters.</t>

<figure><artwork>
   ws = *(
           %x20 /              ; Space
           %x09 /              ; Horizontal tab
           %x0A /              ; Line feed or New line
           %x0D                ; Carriage return
       )
</artwork></figure>
</section>

<section title="Values">

<t>A JSON value MUST be an object, array, number, or string, or one of
the following three literal names:</t>

<figure><artwork>
   false null true
</artwork></figure>

<t>The literal names MUST be lowercase.  No other literal names are
allowed.</t>

<figure><artwork>
   value = false / null / true / object / array / number / string

   false = %x66.61.6c.73.65   ; false

   null  = %x6e.75.6c.6c      ; null

   true  = %x74.72.75.65      ; true
</artwork></figure>

</section>

<section title="Objects">

<t>An object structure is represented as a pair of curly brackets
surrounding zero or more name/value pairs (or members).  A name is a
string.  A single colon comes after each name, separating the name
from the value.  A single comma separates a value from a following
name.  The names within an object SHOULD be unique.</t>

<figure><artwork>
   object = begin-object [ member *( value-separator member ) ]
            end-object

   member = string name-separator value
</artwork></figure>

<t>An object whose names are all unique is interoperable in the
sense that all software implementations which receive
that object will agree on the name-value mappings. 
When the names within an object are not unique, the behavior of
software that receives such an object is unpredictable. Many implementations
report the last name/value pair only; other implementations report an error or
fail to parse the object; other implementations report all of the name/value
pairs, including duplicates.</t> 

</section>

<section title="Arrays">

<t>An array structure is represented as square brackets surrounding zero
or more values (or elements).  Elements are separated by commas.</t>

<figure><artwork>
array = begin-array [ value *( value-separator value ) ] end-array
</artwork></figure>

</section>

<section title="Numbers">

<t>The representation of numbers is similar to that used in most
programming languages.  A number contains an integer component that
may be prefixed with an optional minus sign, which may be followed by
a fraction part and/or an exponent part.</t>

<t>Octal and hex forms are not allowed.  Leading zeros are not allowed.</t>

<t>A fraction part is a decimal point followed by one or more digits.</t>

<t>An exponent part begins with the letter E in upper or lowercase,
which may be followed by a plus or minus sign.  The E and optional
sign are followed by one or more digits.</t>

<t>Numeric values that cannot be represented in the grammar below
(such as Infinity and NaN) are not permitted.</t>

<figure><artwork>
   number = [ minus ] int [ frac ] [ exp ]

   decimal-point = %x2E       ; .

   digit1-9 = %x31-39         ; 1-9

   e = %x65 / %x45            ; e E

   exp = e [ minus / plus ] 1*DIGIT

   frac = decimal-point 1*DIGIT

   int = zero / ( digit1-9 *DIGIT )

   minus = %x2D               ; -

   plus = %x2B                ; +

   zero = %x30                ; 0
</artwork></figure>

<t>This specification allows implementations to set
limits on the range and precision of numbers accepted. Since software which 
implements IEEE 754-2008 <xref target="IEEE754"/> is generally available and
widely used, good interoperability can be achieved by implementations which
expect no more precision or range than provided by an IEEE 754 binary64
(double precision) number, in the sense that implementations will approximate
JSON numbers within the expected precision.  A JSON number which is outside
those bounds, such as 1E400 or 3.141592653589793238462643383279, may indicate
potential interoperability problems since it suggests that the software
which created it it expected greater magnitude or precision than is widely
available.</t>

<t>Note that when such software 
is used, numbers which are integers and are in the range 
[-(2**53)+1, (2**53)-1]
are interoperable in the sense that implementations will agree exactly on
their numeric values.</t>
<!-- you never know, the WG might want it back
<t>Numbers which represent zero without a sign, for example as 0 or 0.0 
not -0 or -0.0, are interoperable in the sense that software implementations
will agree on the zero value.
Signed zeros are significant in some numerically-intensive applications, but
implementations which read JSON texts cannot be relied upon to preserve that
distinction.</t>
-->

</section>

<section title="Strings">

<t>The representation of strings is similar to conventions used in the C
family of programming languages.  A string begins and ends with
quotation marks.  All Unicode characters may be placed within the
quotation marks except for the characters that must be escaped:
quotation mark, reverse solidus, and the control characters (U+0000
through U+001F).</t>

<t>Any character may be escaped.  If the character is in the Basic
Multilingual Plane (U+0000 through U+FFFF), then it may be
represented as a six-character sequence: a reverse solidus, followed
by the lowercase letter u, followed by four hexadecimal digits that
encode the character's code point.  The hexadecimal letters A though
F can be upper or lowercase.  So, for example, a string containing
only a single reverse solidus character may be represented as
"\u005C".</t>

<t>Alternatively, there are two-character sequence escape
representations of some popular characters.  So, for example, a
string containing only a single reverse solidus character may be
represented more compactly as "\\".</t>

<t>To escape an extended character that is not in the Basic Multilingual
Plane, the character is represented as a twelve-character sequence,
encoding the UTF-16 surrogate pair.  So, for example, a string
containing only the G clef character (U+1D11E) may be represented as
"\uD834\uDD1E".</t>

<figure><artwork>
   string = quotation-mark *char quotation-mark

   char = unescaped /
       escape (
           %x22 /          ; "    quotation mark  U+0022
           %x5C /          ; \    reverse solidus U+005C
           %x2F /          ; /    solidus         U+002F
           %x62 /          ; b    backspace       U+0008
           %x66 /          ; f    form feed       U+000C
           %x6E /          ; n    line feed       U+000A
           %x72 /          ; r    carriage return U+000D
           %x74 /          ; t    tab             U+0009
           %x75 4HEXDIG )  ; uXXXX                U+XXXX

   escape = %x5C              ; \

   quotation-mark = %x22      ; "

   unescaped = %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-10FFFF
</artwork></figure>

</section>

<section title="String and Character Issues">

<section title="Encoding and Detection">
<t>JSON text SHALL be encoded in Unicode.  The default encoding is
UTF-8.</t>
<t>Since the first two characters of a JSON text will always be ASCII
characters [RFC0020], it is possible to determine whether an octet
stream is UTF-8, UTF-16 (BE or LE), or UTF-32 (BE or LE) by looking
at the pattern of nulls in the first four octets.</t>

<figure><artwork>
   00 00 00 xx  UTF-32BE
   00 xx 00 xx  UTF-16BE
   xx 00 00 00  UTF-32LE
   xx 00 xx 00  UTF-16LE
   xx xx xx xx  UTF-8
</artwork></figure>
</section>

<section anchor="unichars" title="Unicode Characters">

<t>When all the strings represented in a JSON text are composed
entirely of Unicode characters <xref target="UNICODE"/> (however escaped),
then that JSON text is interoperable in the sense that all
software implementations which parse it will agree on the contents
of names and of string values in objects and arrays.</t>
<t>However, the ABNF in this specification allows member names and
string values to contain bit sequences which cannot encode Unicode characters,
for example "\uDEAD" (a single unpaired UTF-16 surrogate).  Instances of this
have been observed, for example when a library truncates a UTF-16 string
without checking whether the truncation split a
surrogate pair.  The behavior of software which receives JSON texts containing
such values is unpredictable; for example, implementations might
return different values for the length of a string value, or even suffer 
fatal runtime exceptions.</t>
</section>

<section title="String Comparison">
<t>Software implementations are typically required to test names of object
members for equality.  Implementations which transform the textual
representation into sequences of Unicode code units, and then perform the
comparison numerically, code unit by code unit, are interoperable in the sense
that implementations will agree in all cases on equality or inequality of two
strings.  For example, implementations which compare strings with escaped 
characters unconverted may incorrectly find that "a\b" and "a\u005Cb" are not
equal.</t>
</section>

</section>

<section anchor="parsers" title="Parsers">

<t>A JSON parser transforms a JSON text into another representation.  A
JSON parser MUST accept all texts that conform to the JSON grammar.
A JSON parser MAY accept non-JSON forms or extensions.</t>

<t>An implementation may set limits on the size of texts that it
accepts.  An implementation may set limits on the maximum depth of
nesting.  An implementation may set limits on the range and precision of numbers.
An implementation may set limits on the length and character contents
of strings.</t>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>Generally there are security issues with scripting languages.  JSON
is a subset of JavaScript, but excludes
assignment and invocation.</t>

<t>Since JSON's syntax is borrowed from JavaScript, it is possible to use that
language's "eval()" function to parse JSON texts. This generally constitutes
an unacceptable security risk, since the text could contain executable code
along with data declarations.  The same consideration applies in any other
programming languages in which JSON texts conform to that language's
syntax.</t>

</section>

<section title="Examples">

<t>This is a JSON object:</t>
