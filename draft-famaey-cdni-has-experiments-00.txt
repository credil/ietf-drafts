1.  Introduction

   HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) refers to a set of novel streaming
   approaches, which deliver streaming media content over the HTTP
   protocol.  The content is split into chunks, offered in several
   quality layers.  This allows the client to dynamically adapt the
   requested quality, based on available network resources and device
   capabilities.  Delivering HAS content across multiple interconnected
   CDNs introduces some new opportunities and challenges.  Specifically,
   it becomes possible to distribute the chunks of a single HAS content
   stream across multiple CDNs, based on chunk popularity, Quality of
   Service requirements, resource availability, economic or other
   factors.

   Every HAS content stream is accompanied by a Manifest File, which
   lists the chunks of each quality layer and specifies their location
   in the form of a URL.  As stated in [I-D.brandenburg-cdni-has],
   several alternative methods exist for specifying chunk locations:

   o  Relative URLs: The URLs specified in the Manifest File are
      relative to the Manifest File's location and thus all located on
      the same surrogate.

   o  Absolute URLs with Redirection: The Manifest File specifies the
      fully qualified URL of each chunk.  These URLs, however, direct
      the client towards the CDN's request routing node, which in turn
      uses HTTP redirection to send the client to the surrogate hosting
      the actual chunk.

   o  Absolute URLs without Redirection: The URL points directly to the
      surrogate hosting the chunk, effectively allowing the client to
      circumvent the CDN request routing process.

   This document aims to evaluate and compare different request routing
   policies for HAS content, derived from these addressing mechanisms,
   that can be used in CDN-interconnection scenarios.


2.  Experimental Setup

   The scenario used as a basis for the experiments consists of two
   interconnected CDNs.  The downstream CDN is located close to the end-
   user (e.g., a telco CDN), while the upstream CDN is positioned
   further (e.g., in the core Internet).  The upstream CDN is assumed to
   be the main storage facility of the original content.  As such, it
   hosts the Manifest file but can offload content chunks to one or more
   downstream CDNs.  Figure 1 graphically depicts the scenario and lists
   the parameters that were varied in the course of the experiments.

   The upstream CDN request router, upstream CDN content server,
   downstream CDN request router and downstream CDN content server are
   depicted as uRR, uCS, dRR and dCS, respectively.  During the
   experiments, three parameters were varied: the one-way Internet delay
   D, the per-client bandwidth B and the HAS client buffer size P. The
   bandwidth on all other network links was set to 100 Mbps, while the
   one-way network delay was set to 5 ms.  The round trip time (RTT)
   between two nodes can be calculated as the sum of the one-way delays
   of the links on the path between them, multiplied by two.  In the
   performed experiments, the RTT between the client and the dRR/dCS is
   40 ms, as the path connecting them consists of 4 links.  The RTT
   between the client and the uRR/uCS equals (60+2D) ms, as the path
   between them contains 6 links and the Internet path.  Note that the
   figure presents a high level, simplified view of the network topology
   and does not show all individual network links and routers.  The
   processing delay on the CDN surrogates is not taken into account, as
   it is assumed to be negligible compared to the network delay.

               Figure 1: Evaluation scenario and parameters

   Three alternative request routing policies are evaluated and
   compared:

   o  UpstreamRR: The Manifest File points to the uRR for every chunk.
      If the chunk is located within the upstream CDN's network, the uRR
      sends the client a HTTP redirect request to point it to the
      correct uCS.  Otherwise, the uRR redirects the client to dRR,
      which in turn redirects it to the correct dCS.

   o  DirectRR: The Manifest File immediately points to the correct
      request router, which redirects the client to the correct content
      server.  This policy thus allows the client to circumvent going
      via the upstream CDN's network if the chunk is located downstream.

   o  DirectCS: The Manifest File immediately points to the correct
      content server, which allows the client to download segments
      without being redirected.  Compared to the DirectRR policy, the

Internet-Draft         Experiments on HAS and CDNI        September 2012


      indirection of contacting the dRR is avoided.

   The UpstreamRR policy can be seen as the traditional CDN-I approach,
   where clients always contact the original CDN and HTTP redirection is
   used to point them to interconnected CDNs when necessary.  It does
   not require any Manifest File rewriting.  Additionally, the upstream
   CDN does not need any detailed information about chunk locations, as
   it only needs to redirect clients to the downstream request router.
   The DirectRR and DirectCS policies are more complex, as they require
   the upstream CDN to rewrite the original Manifest File.
   Additionally, when using the DirectCS policy, the downstream CDN
   either needs to share detailed chunk location information with the
   upstream CDN or the interconnected CDNs need to collaborate in
   creating the Manifest File.

   The presented policies differ mostly in addressing chunks located in
   the downstream CDN.  As such, the experiments evaluate a scenario
   where a single client downloads 100 HAS video chunks (of 2 seconds
   each) from a content server located within the downstream CDN.  The
   constant bitrate video is available in 3 qualities, with bitrates 500
   kbps, 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps.

   As the end-user Quality of Experience (QoE) depends on several
   factors, multiple evaluation metrics are used in the comparison:

   o  Average played quality: The played quality layer, averaged over
      all chunks and specified in terms of bitrate.  This is expressed
      in megabits per second (Mbps), representing the bandwidth required
      for downloading the played quality layers.

   o  Total buffer starvation time: The accumulated time during which
      the client needs to rebuffer the chunks (excluding the original
      start-up).  A rebuffering occurs when a chunk is not available at
      the client, while it is already required for decoding.  This leads
      to frame freezes, as the client needs to wait for the next chunk
      to arrive, which significantly reduces QoE.

   o  Start-up delay: The time between the initial HTTP request for the
      first chunk, performed by the client, and the time when the chunk
      actually starts playing.

   All reported results were obtained using the NS-3 simulation
   environment [ns3] in combination with the Network Simulation Cradle
   (NSC) [nsc].  NS-3 is a discrete-event network simulator for Internet
   systems.  NSC allows NS-3 to interface directly with the kernel's TCP
   implementation, generating more accurate and realistic results.  The
   used HAS client rate adaptation algorithm is based on the first
   version of the client algorithm incorporated in Microsoft's

3.  Results

   This section lists and discusses experimental results on the average
   played video quality and the start-up delay.  Results on buffer
   starvation are omitted, as they did not occur in the depicted
   scenarios.

   Figure 2 depicts the average played quality (in Mbps) as a function
   of the client bandwidth B, client buffer size P and one-way Internet
   delay D. The depicted results show that, as expected, the delivered
   quality for the DirectRR and DirectCS policies is independent of the
   network delay D between the Interconnected CDNs.  On the other hand,
   when using the standard UpstreamRR policy, quality of the delivered
   HAS content degenerates significantly as the delay increases.  The
   exact breakpoint at which quality starts degrading does depend on
   other factors, of which the available bandwidth is the most
   important.  Specifically, at a bandwidth of 5 Mbps, significant
   quality reductions are visible for upstream CDN network delays of
   more than 100 ms, while this breakpoint increases to over 200 ms for
   a bandwidth of 100 Mbps.

                            = 5Mbps and P = 6s

   In line with the played quality, start-up delay is not negatively
   influenced by an increasing network delay between the interconnected
   CDNs when using the DirectRR and DirectCS policies.  However, when
   using the UpstreamRR policy, the start-up delay increases linearly
   with the network delay D. Note that this start-up delay occurs
   whenever a new stream is requested.  This occurs, for example, when
   switching channels in Internet TV scenarios as well as when users
   skips parts of a movie in a Video on Demand scenario.


4.  Conclusion

   In this document, we proposed, evaluated and compared several
   policies for routing requests and retrieving HAS content chunks
   distributed across multiple interconnected CDNs.  Concretely, the
   traditional policy, herein called UpstreamRR, in which the original
   CDN's request router dynamically redirects the end-users towards the
   CDN currently hosting the requested content, is compared to two novel
   policies, called DirectRR and DirectCS.  These novel policies employ
   HAS Manifest File rewriting to directly point end-users to the
   correct CDN (DirectRR) or even the correct content server (DirectCS).

   A thorough evaluation, based on NS-3 simulation results, was
   conducted.  It shows that the end-user QoE suffers greatly as a
   consequence of the HTTP redirects that occur when employing the
   standard UpstreamRR policy.  Depending on the available bandwidth,
   QoE degradation can start occurring when the one-way network delay
   towards the upstream CDN is greater than 100 milliseconds.  In
   contrast, the reported results also show that the novel DirectRR and
   DirectCS policies perform well under increasing network delays.

   In summary, these results prove the need for advanced request routing
   mechanisms, as well as extensive cooperation between interconnected
   CDNs, to be able to satisfy end-user quality requirements of state-
   of-the-art HAS-based services.
