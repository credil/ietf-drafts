Abstract

   With the development of network technologies, more and more
   applications need to have a central control point for the network
   elements in one administrative domain, such central control point is
   a central control network element (CCNE).  CCNE controls the network
   elements in its administrative domain, the type of CCNE can be RR
   Router, PCE Server, or a federation of RR Router and PCE Server, etc.
   CCNE is developed from the traditional network element, which plus
   some I2RS interfaces, can provide both traditional network services
   and I2RS services.

   This document describes requirement and use cases for which I2RS can
   be used for CCNE device.  The use cases described in this document
   encompass: Control IP Network by RR Router, Control MPLS TE Network
   by PCE Server.  The goal is to inform the community's understanding
   of where the I2RS CCNE extensions fit within the overall I2RS
   architecture.  It is intended to provide a basis for the solutions
   draft describing the set of interfaces for the CCNE device.

Internet-Draft           I2RS Use Cases for CCNE            October 2013


   The I2RS is not intended to replace any existing configuration
   mechanisms.  Instead, I2RS is intended to augment those existing
   mechanisms by defining a standardized set of programmatic interfaces
   to enable easier configuration, interrogation and analysis of the
   protocol.

   With the development of network technologies, more and more
   applications need to have a central control point for the network
   elements in one administrative domain, such central control point is
   a central control network element (CCNE).  CCNE controls the network
   elements in its administrative domain, the type of CCNE can be RR
   Router, PCE Server, or a federation of RR Router and PCE Server, etc.
   CCNE is developed from the traditional network element, which plus
   some I2RS interfaces, can provide both traditional network services
   and I2RS services.

   This document describes requirement and use cases for which I2RS can
   be used for CCNE device.  The use cases described in this document
   encompass: Control IP Network by RR Router, Control MPLS TE Network
   by PCE Server.  The goal is to inform the community's understanding

3.1.  I2RS Use Cases for Controlling Path by RR

   A route reflector (RR) is a network routing component.  It offers an
   alternative to the logical full-mesh requirement of internal border
   gateway protocol (IBGP).  A RR acts as a focal point for IBGP
   sessions.  The purpose of the RR is concentration.  Multiple BGP
   routers can peer with a central point, the RR - acting as a route
   reflector server - rather than peer with every other router in a full
   mesh.  All the other IBGP routers become route reflector clients.

Internet-Draft           I2RS Use Cases for CCNE            October 2013


   Traditional IP network provides only Best Effort (BE) data
   transmission capacity without assuring the reachability, and does not
   provide services with QOS assurance.  Traditional IP path is not
   explicit, and is difficult to monitor and tune.  At the moment IP
   Traffic Engineering usually is being implemented through complicated
   route policy, and does not efficiently use network bandwidth.

   With the IP network more and more widely used, users and applications
   are placing increased demands on Internet service providers (ISPs) to
   deliver explicit IP path configuration, flexible route control, IP
   Traffic Engineering, better QOS, efficiently monitoring and tuning
   method.  To assist network operators in addressing this challenge, we
   present some I2RS RR use case, introduce a set of I2RS programmatic
   APIs for RR that allows a network operator to flexibly control
   routing between the traffic ingresses and egresses within an ISP's
   network.

3.1.1.  RR Provides Whole Network Views

   For an IP network, if all routers run BGP and are connected by a
   centralized RR, and the RR has the topology, network capacity,
   network resource and customer policy etc information of the whole
   network.  Then APP or Controller can get the whole network views from
   RR.

   network topologies.

3.1.2.  Explicit IP Path Configuration on RR

   According to whole network views get from RR, applications can push
   an explicit IP path configuration on RR.  For example in Figure 2, a
   path from Source 1 (S1) to Destination 1 (D1): S1-A-B-C-D1.  The use
   of this path will be described in next Section.

3.1.3.  RR based Traffic Steering

   RR based Traffic Steering ([I-D.ietf-chen-idr-rr-based-traffic-
   steering-usecase]) introduces the requirements and use cases of RRTS.

   For a product network, an acceptable solution should be able to
   smoothly and incrementally upgrade the network and should not affect
   the on-going services.  Route Reflection is widely deployed in the
   field, a Route Reflector (RR) has the ability to "install"/distribute
   a route to its client with the nexthop that can be either the RR
   itself or any other different BGP speakers.  Given this, for an IP
   network, if all routers run BGP and are connected by a centralized
   RR, and the RR has the topology, network capacity, network resource
   and customer policy etc information of the whole network.  Then the
   RR can compute the routes for every router and install/distribute the
   routes to corresponding routers.

            Figure 3: An Architecture for RR


   Figure 3 shows an architecture for RR.  APP and RR gets topology
   information from Topology Manager via Topology API.  APP computes the
   IP Path and pushes the explicit IP Path Configuration to RR via BGP
   RR API.  RR transfers the IP Path into BGP routes and pushes them to
   its clients via BGP API.

   Figure 2 is a reference architecture of the Route Reflection based
   Traffic Steering (RRTS).  The RR and its route reflection clients
   form a RRTS domain.  The RR is a I2RS controller that is responsible
   for the BGP route decision of the whole domain.  All other routers in
   the domain are as route reflection clients of the RR, each router
   will establish an I-BGP session to the RR, and there is no direct BGP
   sessions among these routers.

   This looks no different from the current Route Reflector (RR) based
   architecture.  For each client, it will still run as current, when
   received BGP routes from outside, it will transparently distribute
   the routes to the RR.  For each route, the RR will make the decision
   for each relevant router and then install/distribute the route to
   each related router.

   For example, for a path from Source 1 (S1) to Destination 1 (D1), if
   the computed path is: S1-A-B-C-D1, then the RR will distribute a
   route (D1) to C with the nexthop set to D1; a route (D1) to B with
   the nexthop set to C, and a route (D1) to A with the nexthop set to
   B, and finally the route (D1) will be distributed to S1 by A.

   RRTS will not require the clients to make any changes.  All the
   changes are made on the RR, the RR can apply any route or traffic
   engineering algorithms.

Internet-Draft           I2RS Use Cases for CCNE            October 2013


3.1.4.  RR Events

3.1.4.1.  Notification of IP Path Events

   With I2RS, it is conceivable that applications could tell the status
   of an IP Path.

3.1.4.2.  Tracing IP Paths

   With I2RS, it would be possible for an I2RS controller to rapidly
   gather information from across a large set of BGP routers in the
   network via RR, then we can trace the state of IP path easily.

3.2.  I2RS Use Case for Controlling MPLS TE Network Path by PCE

   Path computation in large, multi-domain networks is complex and may
   require special computational components and cooperation between the
   elements in different domains.  PCE [RFC4655] is proposed to address
   this problem.

   With PCE, operator can make more services and traffic to be hold in
   the same MPLS TE network, and promote network resource utilization.

   The following describes set of use cases for which I2RS's
   programmatic interfaces can be used to control and analyze MPLS TE
   network.  PCE use cases described in this document cover the
   following aspects: TE Link attributes configuration, TE constraints
   configuration, global concurrent re-optimization, network topology or
   resource query and failure simulation.  The goal is to inform the
   community's understanding of where the I2RS PCE extensions fit within
   the overall I2RS architecture.  It is intended to provide a basis for
   the solutions draft describing the set of Interfaces to the PCE.

3.2.1.  PCE Server Provides Whole MPLS TE Network Views

   For MPLS TE network, if all routers, include PCE and PCC devices, run
   IGP and PCEP protocols, then PCE device has a view of the TE topology
   and network resources of the whole MPLS TE network.

   With I2RS, the centralized I2RS Controller may get the whole MPLS TE
   topology and network resources from the PCE devices.  It is not
   necessary for PCC devices to update to support I2RS.  Before upgrade
   a current network, network operator may need to check if it is
   needed.  PCE makes it easy for operator to check network resource by
   providing some user query interfaces.  With I2RS, the process may be
   put in I2RS controller, and connected with other applications like
   resource visualized tools, this will make it easy for operator do
   network management and maintenance.

3.2.2.  Global Concurrent Re-Optimization

   Stateful PCE [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of LSPs via PCEP.  With
   delegation of control over LSPs from PCC, an active stateful PCE can
   request a PCC to update one or more attributes of an LSP and to re-
   signal the LSP with updated attributes.  Global concurrent re-
   optimization is a concurrent path computation application where a set
   of TE paths are computed concurrently in order to efficiently utilize
   network resources.

3.2.2.1.  TE Link and TE LSP Constraint Configuration

   To adjust MPLS TE path more subtly, new link attributes such as
   latency may be proposed to gain the goal.  However, it is not a good
   way to upgrade devices or extends protocols.  It would be easy if PCE
   provide interfaces to set TE links' attributes and TE LSPs'
   constraints.

   With I2RS, The interfaces can be extended to conveniently adjust TE
   network logical topology.

Internet-Draft           I2RS Use Cases for CCNE            October 2013


3.2.2.2.  Calculated Path Approve and Disapprove

   With interfaces to set TE links' attributes and TE LSPs' constraints,
   network operator may trigger a global concurrent re-optimization
   after some modification.  He may want to check results before they
   take effect.  A confirmation mechanism is proposed for operator to
   confirm the calculated result, and paths would be sent to PCC if
   approved otherwise canceled.

   With I2RS, I2RS controller can easily promote the network resource
   utilization by triggering PCE to do global concurrent re-optimization
   if necessary and approve or disapprove with the calculated results.

3.2.3.  Failure Simulation

   When outages in a network are planned (e.g., for maintenance
   purposes), some graceful mechanisms can be used to gracefully shut
   down MPLS-TE / GMPLS-TE on a resource such as a TE link, a component
   link within a bundled TE link, a label resource, or an entire TE
   node, to avoid traffic disruption.  Typically IGP or RSVP-TE protocol
   is extended to notify ingress node to bypass the shut down point.

   With I2RS, I2RS controller can easily implement failure simulation by
   triggering a global concurrent re-optimization with some shutdown
   points.

3.3.  Requirements for I2RS

   From the above use cases, the requirements for I2RS are:

   1.  I2RS interface should support CCNE include both RR and PCE or
   other.  It should be able to read both RR and PCE topology
   information in a timely manner.

   2.  I2RS interface should be able to set resource's constraint value
   to CCNE.

   3.  I2RS interface should be able to set service goal value to CCNE.

   4.  I2RS interface should be able to re-optimization traffic model by
   CCNE.

   5.  I2RS interface should be able to send event or alarm notification
   form CCNE.

   6.  CCNE should support traditional protocol to communicate with
   general NE.

   7.  CCNE should support I2RS interface for network control.  CCNE is
   a NE with double role, controller and NE.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   Routing information is very critical and sensitive information for
   the operators.  I2RS should provide strong security mechanism to
   protect the routing information that it could not be accessed by the
   un-authorised users.  It should also protect the security and
   integrity protection of the routing data.
