                         PCP Address Expiration
                      draft-cheshire-pcp-expire-00

Abstract

   Port Control Protocol (PCP) Address Expiration allows an address
   allocation agent (e.g. a DHCP Server) to signal to a NAT or firewall
   that an address that was previously in use is no longer in use, and
   all state pertaining to it may be discarded.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   NATs and firewalls create implicit mapping state as a result of
   seeing outbound traffic from the host.  In addition, Port Control
   Protocol [PCP] allows a host to explicitly request mappings.  All
   NATs and firewalls have some finite limit on the amount of mapping
   state they can accomodate, so releasing mapping state when it is no
   longer required makes those resources available for other clients.
   When a host leaves the network and its DHCP address lease expires,
   any mapping state associated with that address is no longer required.
   In addition, allowing old mapping state to remain after the address
   is assigned to a new host could potentially expose that new host to
   unwanted traffic.  Therefore, when a DHCP address lease expires or is
   released, the DHCP server should signal to the NAT or firewall that
   all mapping state associated with that address should be released.

   In the case of a typical residential home gateway, the DHCP server is
   colocated with the NAT or firewall in the same hardware device, and
   the signal from the DHCP server software component to the NAT or
   firewall software component can be a simple internal software
   operation.

   In the case of an Internet Service Provider, the DHCP server and
   Large Scale NAT may often be implemented in different devices.  In
   this case it would be useful to have a network protocol to enable the
   DHCP server to signal Address Expiration to the Large Scale NAT.
   This could be done via some proprietary mechanism, or via some SNMP
   message, but the most natural way to implement this state management
   message would be via a PCP Opcode.

3.  PCP Address Expiration

   When a DHCP address lease expires or is released, and the DHCP server
   wishes to inform the NAT and/or firewall device(s) of this, it sends
   the PCP request [PCP] shown below:

       Figure 1: PCP Address Expiration Request and Response Format

   When the "Expired Internal IP Address" field is an IPv6 address, the
   IPv6 address is placed in the field as-is.

   When the "Expired Internal IP Address" field is an IPv4 address, an
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 address [RFC4291] is used (::ffff:0:0/96).  This has
   the first 80 bits set to zero and the next 16 set to one, while its
   last 32 bits are filled with the IPv4 address.  This is unambiguously
   distinguishable from a native IPv6 address, because an IPv4-mapped
   IPv6 address [RFC4291] would not be valid for a mapping.

   The PCP Address Expiration Request MUST be sent in such a way that
   its authenticity can be verified by the receiving NAT or firewall.
   For example, the request could be signed and timestamped to prove
   that it was generated by an entity authorized to do so (e.g. the DHCP
   server).  Alternatively, the request could be sent over a secure
   channel, such as TLS, or DTLS, where the identity of the sender is
   securely verified.  In some environments, if the PCP Address
   Expiration Request is sent over a private network within a service
   provider's data centre, with adequate ingress filtering, then merely
   checking the source IP address of the packet against a whitelist may
   be adequate.  If the request fails such authentication checks, a
   NOT_AUTHORIZED error MUST be returned.

   The NAT or firewall replies with a PCP Response containing the same
   Expired Internal IP Address, and an appropriate response code.  If
   the request was properly authenticated and all existing mapping state
   (if any) for the specified address was successfully deleted, then a
   SUCCESS response code (zero) is returned.  Otherwise an an
   appropriate non-zero response code is returned.

4.  Security Considerations

   NATs and firewalls MUST verify that PCP Address Expiration Requests
   are properly authorized.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to record that PCP Opcode 3 is allocated for "PCP
   Expire".
