Abstract

   This document moves RFC4743 (Using NETCONF over the Simple Object
   Access Protocol (SOAP)) and RFC4744 (Using the NETCONF Protocol over
   the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP)) to HISTORIC status to
   reflect the fact that those two documents have shown very little (if
   any) implementations and deployment.  Furthermore, no-one in the
   NETCONF WG is interested or volunteering to work on them anymore.

1.  Introduction

   This document moves RFC 4743 [RFC4743] and RFC 4744 [RFC4744] to
   HISTORIC status in accordance with RFC 2026 [RFC2026].  These two
   documents have seen very little (if any) implementations or
   deployment, and none of the initial proponents are active in the
   NETCONF space anymore.  No-one (else) in the WG is interested or
   willing to pick up responsibility for these documents.

   If these 2 documents were to be kept current, then changes might be
   needed for compatibility with the current version of NETCONF 1.1.

   In the WG nobody gave a positive response when asked who is using it
   or wants to keep it.


2.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to the original editors/authors of RFC4743 and RFC4744.  At
   the time that those RFCs were written, these NETCONF transports
   seemed to be attractive.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


4.  Security Considerations

   This draft introduces no new security considerations.
