Abstract

   There are circumstances in RPKI operations where a resource holder's
   parent may not be able to, or may not choose to, facilitate full and
   proper registration of the holder's data.  As in real life, the
   holder may form a relationship with their grandparent who is willing
   to aid the grandchild.  This document describes simple procedures for
   doing so.

1.  Introduction

   There are circumstances in RPKI operations where a resource holder's
   parent may not be able to, or may not choose to, facilitate full and
   proper registration of the holder's data.  As in real life, the
   holder may form a relationship with their grandparent who is willing
   to aid the grandchild.  This document describes simple procedures for
   doing so.

   An example might be when provider A allowed a child, C, to move to
   other provider(s) and keep their address space, either temporarily or
   permanently, and C's child, G, wished to stay with provider A.

   Or a child, C, in the process of going out of business might place
   their grandchildren in precarious circumstances until they can re-
   home.  The grandparent, without disturbing the child's data, could
   simply issue ROAs for the grandchildren, or issue certificates for
   those willing to manage their own rpki data.

   Certification Authorities with a large number of children, e.g.  very
   large ISPs or RIRs, might offer documented grandparenting processes
   and/or agreements.  This might reassure grandchildren with worries
   about irresponsible parents.

   Other examples occur in administrative hierarchies, such as large
   organizations or military and other government hierarchies, when A's
   child C wishes to manage their own data but does not wish the
   technical or administrative burden of managing their children's, Gs',
   data.

2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands the RPKI, see [RFC6480],
   ROAs, see [RFC6482], BGPSEC Router Certificates, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-
   bgpsec-pki-profiles], and the operational guidance for origin
   validation, [I-D.ietf-sidr-origin-ops].

3.  What to Do

   A hypothetical example might be that A has the rights to 10.0.0.0/8,
   has delegated 10.42.0.0/16 to their child C, who delegated 10.42.2.0/
   23 to their child G.  C has changed providers and kept, with A's
   consent, 10.42.0.0/16, but G wishes to stay with A and keep 10.42.2.0
   /23.

   Perhaps there are also AS resources involved, and G wishes to issue
   Router Certificates for their AS(s).

Internet-Draft   Responsible Grandparenting in the RPKI     October 2012


   Managing RPKI data in such relationships is simple, but should be
   done carefully.

   First, using whatever administrative and/or contractual procedures
   are appropriate in the local hierarchy, the grandparent, A, should
   ensure their relationship to the grandchild, G, and that G has the
   right to the resources which they wish to have registered.  These are
   local matters between A and G.

   Although A has the rights over their child's, C's, resources, it
   would be prudent and polite to ensure that C agrees to A forming a
   relationship to G.  Again, these are local matters between A, C, and
   G.  Often, no one outside of one of these bi-lateral relationships
   actually knows the agreement between the parties.

   Then, it is trivial within the RPKI for A to certify G's data, even
   though it is a subset of the resources A delegated to C.  A may
   certify G's resources, or issue one or more EE certificates and ROAs
   for G's resources.  Which is done is a local matter between A and G.

4.  Security Considerations

   This operational practice presents no technical security threats
   beyond those of the relevant RPKI specifications.

   There are threats of social engineering by G, lying to A about their
   relationship to and rights gained from C.

   There are also threats of social engineering by C, attempting to
   prevent A from giving rights to G which G legitimately deserves.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA Considerations.
