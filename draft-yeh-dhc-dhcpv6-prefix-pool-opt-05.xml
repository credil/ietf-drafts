<abstract>
<t>The DHCPv6 Prefix Pool option provides a mechanism for DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD), allowing the DHCPv6 server to notify a DHCPv6 relay agent implemented on a Provider Edge (PE) router about active prefix pools allocated by the DHCPv6 server to the PE router. The information of active prefix pools can be used to enforce IPv6 route aggregation on the PE router by adding or removing aggregated routes according to the status of the prefix pools. The advertising of the aggregated routes in the routing protocol enabled on the network-facing interface of PE routers will dramatically decreases the number of the routing table entries in the network.</t>

<section anchor="s1" title="Introduction">

<t>The DHCPv6 protocol <xref target="RFC3315"/> specifies a mechanism for the assignment of IPv6 address and configuration information to IPv6 nodes. The DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) <xref target="RFC3633"/> specifies a mechanism for the delegation of IPv6 prefixes from the Delegating Router (DR) acting as the DHCPv6 server to the Requesting Routers (RR) acting as the DHCPv6 Clients. DHCPv6 servers always maintain authoritative information related to their operations including, but not limited to, binding data of the delegated IPv6 prefixes, lease data of the delegated IPv6 prefixes, and binding data of their prefix pools. A prefix pool configured and maintained on the server can usually be a short prefix (e.g., a /40 prefix) out of which the longer prefixes (e.g., /56 prefixes) are delegated to customer networks.</t>

<t>In the scenario of a centralized DHCPv6 server, the Provider Edge (PE) routers act as DHCPv6 relay agents when the DHCPv6 server acting as DR and the DHCPv6 clients acting as RRs are not on the same link. For ensuring reachability, the PE routers always need to add or withdraw the route entries directing to each customer network in their routing table to reflect the status of IPv6 prefixes delegated by the DHCPv6 server to customer routers (a.k.a. Routed-RG or Routed-CPE), which acts as RRs (see Section 6.2, <xref target="BBF TR-177"/>).</t>

<t>When a routing protocol is enabled on the network-facing interface of the PE router, all the routes directing to the customer networks are advertised in the ISP network. This will make the number of route entries in the routing table on the ISP router unacceptable large. Hence, it is desirable to aggregate the routes directing to the customer networks on the PE router.</t>

<t>Because the prefixes of the customer networks can not be guaranteed to be valid and continuous, the routing protocol enabled on the PE router in general can not create one aggregated route automatically to cover all the prefixes delegated within the prefix pool. One way to make the aggregated routes is to configure them manually and permanently per the provision of the prefix pools, but the PE router generally does not know about the prefix pools when it acts as the relay agent.</t>

<t> This document proposes a new Prefix Pool option for the DHCPv6 relay agent implemented on PE routers, allowing the DHCPv6 server to notify the DHCPv6 relay agent about the prefix of pools. After the PE router received information about the prefix pools, the aggregated route entries (e.g., black-hole routes) pointing to each of the prefix pools can be added or withdrawn in the routing table of the PE router. The aggregated routes will be advertised into the ISP network through the routing protocol enabled on the PE's network-facing interface.</t>

<t>DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery <xref target="RFC5460"/> specifies a mechanism for bulk transfer of the binding data of each delegated prefix from the server to the requestor (i.e., a DHCPv6 relay agent), to support the replacement or reboot event of a relay agent. In this document, the capability of DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery will be extended to support the bulk transfer of the binding data of the prefix pools for route aggregation.</t>

<t>The status of 'Valid' in the Prefix Pool option can be used to add the prefix pool and the associated aggregated route on the relay agent; while the status of 'Released' in the Prefix Pool option can be used to withdraw the prefix pool and the associated aggregated route on the relay agent.</t>

<t>If the administrative policy on the DHCPv6 server permits and supports route aggregation on the relay agent, the status of prefix pool can be determined by the delegated prefixes within the associated prefix pool. If there is one delegated prefix within the pool that has a valid lease, the status of the prefix pool will be 'Valid'.  Otherwise, the status of the prefix pool is 'Released'. If the administrative policy on the server does not permit or support route aggregation on the DHCPv6 relay agent, the status of the prefix pool will always be 'Released'.</t>

</section>


<section anchor="s5" title="Relay Agent Behavior">

<t>The relay agent who needs the information of prefix pools, must include the Option Request option (OPTION_ORO, 6) to request the Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]) from the DHCPv6 server, who maintains the status of the prefix pools associated to the relay agent itself (Figure 1) or its particular customer-facing interface (Figure 2) when receiving the DHCPv6-PD message from clients. The DHCPv6 relay agent can include this Option Request option for the Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]) in the relay-forward (12) message of SOLICIT (1), REQUEST (3), RENEW(5), REBIND (6) and RELEASE (8). The relay agent may also include the Prefix Pool option with the field values of pfx-pool-len and IPv6-prefix to indicate its preference which prefix pool the relay agent would like the server to return.</t> 

<t>The relay agent should include the Interface ID option (OPTION_INTERFACE_ID, 18) so that the DHCPv6 server can identify the relay agent itself or its particular customer-facing interface to which the prefix pool is associated, if the server would not like to use the link-address field specified in the encapsulation of the DHCPv6 relay-forward message to identify the interface of the link on which the clients are located.</t>

<t>After receiving the Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]) for the relay agent itself or its particular customer-facing interface in the relay-reply message (13) of REPLY (7) from the DHCPv6 server, the relay agent shall add or withdraw the aggregated route entry per the status of the prefix pool. If the status of the prefix pool received from the server is 'Valid', the relay agent shall add an aggregated route entry in its routing table, if the same entry has not been added in. If the status of the prefix pool received from the server is 'Released', the relay agent shall withdraw the associated aggregated route entry in its routing table, if the same entry has not been withdrawn. If there is no route entry directing to the customer network within the associated aggregated route, the relay agent shall automatically withdraw the aggregated route.</t>

<t>The relay agent advertises its routing table including the entries of the aggregated routes based on the information of prefix pools when the routing protocol is enabled on its network-facing interface.</t>

<t>The Relay Agent (i.e., Requestor) can use the DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery <xref target="RFC5460"/> to query the binding data of prefix pools in the 'Valid' status from the server. After established a TCP connection with the DHCPv6 server, the relay agent must include Query option (OPTION_LQ_QUERY, 44) and set the proper query-type (QUERY_BY_RELAY_ID, QUERY_BY_LINK_ADDRESS, QUERY_BY_REMOTE_ID), link-address and query-options in the LEASEQUERY (14) message. The query options must include Option Request option (OPTION_ORO, 6) to request the Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]) from the server.</t>

</section>


<section anchor="s6" title="Server Behavior">

<t>Per DHCPv6-PD <xref target="RFC3633"/>, if the prefix of the customer network requested in relay-forward message of SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW, REBIND by the DHCPv6 client (i.e., the RR) has a valid lease, the DHCPv6 server (i.e., the DR) will delegate the prefix with the relevant parameters in the relay-reply message of REPLY. In order to give a meaningful reply, the server has to be able to maintain the binding data of the delegated IPv6 prefixes with the identification of the client. The Interface ID option (OPTION_INTERFACE_ID, 18) nested in the relay-forward message is usually used to identify the access line of the client.</t>

<t>After receiving the Option Request option (OPTION_ORO, 6) requesting the Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]) in the relay-forward messages of the PD, the server must include the Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]) with the status indicated for the associated relay agent itself (Figure 1) or its customer-facing interface (Figure 2) in the relay-reply messages if the relay-forward messages received are valid.</t>

<t>The server may use the link-address specified in relay-forward message to identify the relay agent itself or its particular customer-facing interface where the prefix pool is associated, but the server has to maintain the binding data of prefix pools in association with these link-addresses. To be more readable, the server can alternatively use the Interface ID option (OPTION_INTERFACE_ID, 18) included in the relay-forward message by the relay agent to identify the relay agent itself (Figure 1) or its particular customer-facing interface (Figure 2) where the prefix pool is associated. In order to give a meaningful reply, the server has to maintain the binding data of prefix pools in association with the information derived from the Interface ID option.</t>

<t>Per DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"/>, the server shall copy the same Interface ID option received via the relay-forward message into the relay-reply message.</t>

<t>If the server is configured to support route aggregation on the relay agent for the particular prefix pool, the status of this prefix pool can be determined by the delegated prefixes within the associated prefix pool. If at least one of delegated prefix in the associated prefix pool has a valid lease, the server shall set the status of the prefix pool to be 'Valid'. If the lease of each delegated prefix within the associated prefix pool has expired, or if the delegated prefix in the relay-forward message of RELEASE is the last prefix releasing in the associated prefix pool, the server shall set the status of the associated prefix pool to be 'Released'. If the server is configured to not support route aggregation on the relay agent for the particular prefix pool, the status of prefix pool will always be 'Released'.</t> 

<t>When the administrator of the server changes the setting to support route aggregation on the relay agent for the particular prefix pool, the server may send a relay-reply message of RECONFIGURE (10) including the Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]) to add or withdraw the prefix pool and the associated aggregated route on the relay agent if at least one delegated prefix within the prefix pool has the valid lease.</t>

<t>Multiple prefix pools may be associated with the same PE router implementing a DHCPv6 relay agent (Figure 1) or its customer-facing interface (Figure 2) in the binding table on the server. Note that the delegated prefix is only from one prefix pool.</t>

<t>After receiving the LEASEQUERY (14) message from the relay agent with the Query option (OPTION_LQ_QUERY, 44) including the Option Request option (OPTION_ORO, 6) to request the Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]), the server must include the Client Data options (OPTION_CLIENT_DATA, 45) in the LEASEQUERY-REPLY (15) and LEASEQUERY-DATA (16) message to convey the binding data of the associated prefix pools with the 'Valid' status through the established TCP connection per <xref target="RFC5460"/>. Each Client Data option (OPTION_CLIENT_DATA, 45) shall contain a Prefix Pool option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL, [TBD]), and may contain the Interface ID option (OPTION_INTERFACE_ID, 18). In order to be able to provide meaningful replies to different query types, the server has to be able to maintain the relevant association of prefix pools with the RELAY_ID, link addresses or Remote_ID of the relay agent in its binding database.</t>
