    <abstract>
      <t>This document identifies foundational use cases, derived functional capabilities and requirements, architectural components, and the supporting standards needed to define an interoperable, automation infrastructure required to support timely, accurate and actionable situational awareness over an organization's IT systems.  Automation tools implementing a continuous monitoring approach will utilize this infrastructure together with existing and emerging event, incident and network management standards to provide visibility into the state of assets, user activities and network behavior.  Stakeholders will be able to use these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant security and operational data to understand the organizations security posture, quantify business risk, and make informed decisions that support organizational objectives while protecting critical information.  Organizations will be able to use these tools to augment and automate information sharing activities to collaborate with partners to identify and mitigate threats. Other automation tools will be able to integrate with these capabilities to enforce policies based on human decisions to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the overall attack surface.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document addresses foundational use cases in security automation. Portions of these use cases may be considered when establishing a charter for the Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) working group within the IETF.  This working group will address a portion of the standards needed to define an interoperable, automation infrastructure required to support timely, accurate and actionable situational awareness over an organization's IT systems. This document enumerates use cases and break down related concepts that cross many IT security information domains.</t>
      <t>Sections [...] of this document focus on:
        <list>
          <t>Defining the key concepts and terminology used within the document providing a common frame of reference;</t>
          <t>Identifying foundational use cases that represent classes of stakeholders, goals, and usage scenarios;</t>
          <t>A set of derived functional capabilities and associated requirements that are needed to support the use cases;</t>
          <t>A break down of architectural components that address one or more functional capabilities that can be used in various combinations to support the use cases; and</t>
          <t>An inventory of existing, emerging, and needed data exchange models and communications protocols that are required to support interoperability between architectural components.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The standards identified in this document provide a foundation for creating interoperable automation tools and continuous monitoring solutions that provide visibility into the state of assets, user activities, and network behavior.  Stakeholders will be able to use these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant security and operational data to understand the organizations security posture, quantify business risk, and make informed decisions that support organizational objectives while protecting critical information.  Organizations will be able to use these tools to augment and automate information sharing activities to collaborate with partners to identify and mitigate threats. Other automation tools will be able to integrate with these capabilities to enforce policies based on human decisions to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the overall attack surface.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
