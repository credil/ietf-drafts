Internet-Draft     An IETF URN Sub-Namespace for OAuth         July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Various extensions and companion specifications to The OAuth 2.0
   Authorization Framework [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] utilize URIs to identify
   the extension in use or other relevant context.  This document
   creates and registers an IETF URN Sub-namespace, as documented in RFC
   3553 [RFC3553], for use with such specifications.  The new 'oauth'
   sub-namespace is urn:ietf:params:oauth and OAuth relevant parameters
   will be established underneath it.


2.  Registration Template

   If a registrant wishes to have a OAuth URI registered, then a URN of
   the form urn:ietf:params:oauth:<value> will be requested where
   <value> is a suitable representation of the functionality or concept
   being registered.

   The registration procedure for new entries requires a request in the
   form of the following template and is Specification Required per RFC
   5226 [RFC5226].

   URN:
      The URI that identifies the registered functionality.

   Common Name:
      The name by which the functionality being registered is generally
      known.

   Change Controller:  For standards-track RFCs, state "IETF".  For
      others, give the name of the responsible party.  Other details
      (e.g., postal address, e-mail address, home page URI) may also be
      included.

   Specification Document(s):  Reference to the document that specifies
      the URI, preferably including a URI that can be used to retrieve a
      copy of the document.  An indication of the relevant sections may
      also be included, but is not required.

   The registration request for the urn:ietf:params:oauth URN Sub-
   namespace is found in the IANA Considerations (Section 4) section of
   this document.

2.1.  Example Registration Request

   The following is an example registration request for a URI underneath
   the urn:ietf:params:oauth sub-namespece.  The requested URI
   represents a new OAuth 2.0 grant type.

Internet-Draft     An IETF URN Sub-Namespace for OAuth         July 2012


   This is a request to IANA to please register the value
   "grant-type:example" in the registry urn:ietf:params:oauth
   established in An IETF URN Sub-Namespace for OAuth.

   o  URN: urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:example

   o  Common Name: An Example Grant Type for OAuth 2.0

   o  Change controller: IETF

   o  Specification Document: [[the document URI]]


3.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations beyond those already
   inherent to using URNs.  Security considerations for URNs in general
   can be found in RFC 2141 [RFC2141].

   Any work that is related to OAuth would benefit from familiarity with
   the security considerations of The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2].


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes two requests of IANA:

   o  Registration of a new IANA URN sub-namespace,
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:, per RFC 3553 [RFC3553].  The registration
      request can be found in Section 4.1 below.

   o  Establishment of a new registry for URNs subordinate to
      urn:ietf:params:oauth.  Instructions for a registrant to request
      the registration of such a URN are in Section 2.

4.1.  IETF URN Sub-namespace Registration urn:ietf:params:oauth

   Per RFC 3553 [RFC3553], IANA is requested to please register a new
   URN sub-namespace, urn:ietf:params:oauth.

   o  Registry name: oauth

   o  Specification: [[this document]]

   o  Repository: [[The registry created in Section 3.]]

   o  Index value: values subordinate to urn:ietf:params:oauth are of
      the form urn:ietf:params:oauth:<value> with <value> as the index
      value.  It is suggested that <value> include both a "class" and an
      "identifier-within-class" component, with the two components being
      separated by a colon (":"); other compositions of the <value> may
      also be used.
