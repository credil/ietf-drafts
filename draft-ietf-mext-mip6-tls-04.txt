Transport Layer Security-based Mobile IPv6 Security Framework for Mobile
                    Node to Home Agent Communication
                    draft-ietf-mext-mip6-tls-04.txt

Abstract

   Mobile IPv6 signaling between a mobile node and its home agent is
   secured using IPsec.  The security association between a mobile node
   and the home agent is established using IKEv1 or IKEv2.  The security
   model specified for Mobile IPv6, which relies on IKE/IPsec, requires
   interaction between the Mobile IPv6 protocol component and the IKE/
   IPsec module of the IP stack.  This document proposes an alternate
   security framework for Mobile IPv6 and Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6, which
   relies on Transport Layer Security for establishing keying material
   and other bootstrapping parameters required to protect Mobile IPv6
   signaling and data traffic between the mobile node and home agent.

Internet-Draft     TLS-based MIPv6 Security Framework         March 2012


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275] signaling, and optionally user traffic, between
   a mobile node (MN) and home agent (HA) are secured by IPsec
   [RFC4301].  The current Mobile IPv6 security architecture is
   specified in [RFC3776] and [RFC4877].  This security model requires a
   tight coupling between the Mobile IPv6 protocol part and the IKE(v2)/
   IPsec part of the IP stack.  Client implementation experience has
   shown that the use of IKE(v2)/IPsec with Mobile IPv6 is fairly
   complex.

   This document proposes an alternate security framework for Mobile
   IPv6 and Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6.  The objective is to simplify
   implementations as well as make it easy to deploy the protocol
   without compromising on security.  Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [RFC5246] is widely implemented in almost all major operating systems
   and extensively used by various applications.  Instead of using IKEv2
   to establish security associations, the security framework proposed
   in this document is based on TLS protected messages to exchange keys
   and bootstrapping parameters between the Mobile Node and a new
   functional entity called as the Home Agent Controller (HAC).  The
   Mobile IPv6 signaling between the mobile node and home agent is
   subsequently secured using the resulting keys and negotiated cipher
   suite.  The HAC can be co-located with the HA, or can be an
   independent entity.  For the latter case, communication between HAC
   and HA is not defined by this document.  Such communication could be
   built on top of AAA protocols such as Diameter, for instance.

   The primary advantage of using TLS based establishment of Mobile IP6
   security associations compared to IKEv2 is the ease of implementation
   while providing an equivalent level of security.  For the protection
   of signaling messages and user plane traffic a solution is provided
   that decouples Mobile IPv6 security from IPsec, thereby reducing
   client implementation complexity.

   The security framework proposed in this document is not intended to
   replace the currently specified architecture which relies on IPsec
   and IKEv2.  It provides an alternative solution which is more optimal
   for certain deployment scenarios.  This and other alternative
   security models have been considered by the MEXT working group at the
   IETF, and it has been decided that the alternative solutions should
   be published as Experimental RFCs, so that more implementation and
   deployment experience with these models can be gathered.  The working
   group may reconsider the status of the different models in the
   future, if it becomes clear that one is superior to the others.

2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Home Agent Controller (HAC):

      The home agent controller is a node responsible for bootstrapping
      Mobile IPv6 security associations between a mobile node and one or
      more home agents.  The home agent controller also provides key
      distribution to both mobile nodes and home agents.  Mobile IPv6
      bootstrapping is also performed by the HA in addition to the
      security association bootstrapping between the mobile node and
      home agent controller.

   Binding Management Messages:

      Mobile IPv6 signaling messages between a mobile node and a home
      agent, correspondent node or mobility access point to manage the
      bindings are referred to as binding management messages.  Binding
      Updates and Binding Acknowledgement messages are examples of
      binding management messages.



3.  Background

   Mobile IPv6 design and specification was begun in the mid to late
   90s.  The security architecture of Mobile IPv6 was based on the
   understanding that IPsec is an inherent and integral part of the IPv6
   stack and any protocol that needs security should use IPsec unless
   there is a good reason not to.  As a result of this mindset the
   Mobile IP6 protocol relied on the use of IPsec for security between
   the MN and HA.  While reuse of security components that are part of
   the IP stack is a good objective, in the case of Mobile IPv6,
   implementation complexity increases.  It should be noted that Mobile
   IPv4 [RFC5944] for example does not use IPsec for security and
   instead has specified its own security solution.  Mobile IPv4 has
   been implemented and deployed on a reasonably large scale and the
   security model has proven itself to be sound.

   Mobile IPv6 standardization was completed in 2005 along with the
   security architecture using IKE/IPsec specified in RFC 3776
   [RFC3776].  With the evolution to IKEv2 [RFC5996], Mobile IP6
   security has also been updated to rely on the use of IKEv2 [RFC4877].
   Implementation exercises of Mobile IPv6 and Dual-stack Mobile IPv6
   [RFC5555] have identified the complexity of using IPsec and IKEv2 in

   conjunction with Mobile IPv6.  Implementing Mobile IPv6 with IPsec
   and IKEv2 requires modifications to both the IPsec and IKEv2
   components, due to the communication models that Mobile IPv6 uses and
   the changing IP addresses.  For further details, see Section 7.1 in
   [RFC3776].

   This document proposes a security framework based on TLS protected
   establishment of Mobile IPv6 security associations with reduced
   implementation complexity, while maintaining an equivalent (to IKEv2/
   IPsec) level of security.


4.  TLS-based Security Establishment

4.1.  Overview

   The security architecture proposed in this document relies on a
   secure TLS session established between the MN and the HAC for
   authentication and MN-HA security association bootstrapping.
   Authentication of the HAC is done via standard TLS operation wherein
   the HAC uses a TLS server certificate as its credentials.  MN
   authentication is done by the HAC via signaling messages that are
   secured by the TLS connection.  Any EAP method can be used for
   authenticating the MN to the HAC.  Upon successful completion of
   authentication, the HAC generates keys which are delivered to the MN
   through the secure TLS channel.  The same keys are also provided to
   the assigned HA.  The HAC also provides the MN with MIP6
   bootstrapping information such as the IPv6 and IPv4 address of the
   HA, the Home network prefix, the IPv6 and/or IPv4 HoA and, DNS server
   address.

   The MN and HA use security associations based on the keys and SPIs
   generated by the HAC and delivered to the MN and HA to secure
   signaling and optionally user plane traffic.  Figure 1 below is an
   illustration of the process.

   Signaling messages and user plane traffic between the MN and HA are
   always UDP encapsulated.  The packet formats for the signaling and
   user plane traffic is described in Sections 6.3 and 6.4.

4.2.  Architecture

   The TLS-based security architecture is shown in Figure 2.  The
   signaling message exchange between the MN and the HAC is protected by
   TLS.  It should be noted that a HAC, a AAA server and a HA are
   logically separate entities and can be collocated in all possible
   combinations.  There MUST be a strong trust relationship between the
   HA and the HAC, and the communication between them MUST be both
   integrity and confidentially protected.

4.3.  Security Association Management

   Once the MN has contacted the HAC and mutual authentication has taken
   place between the MN and the HAC, the HAC securely provisions the MN
   with all security related information inside the TLS protected
   tunnel.  This security related information constitutes a security
   association (SA) between the MN and the HA.  The created SA MUST NOT
   be tied to the Care-of Address (CoA) of the MN.

   The HAC may proactively distribute the SA information to HAs, or the
   HA may query the SA information from the HAC once the MN contacts the
   HA.  If the HA requests SA information from the HAC, then the HA MUST
   be able to query/index the SA information from the HAC based on the
   Security Parameter Index (SPI) identifying the correct security
   association between the MN and the HA.

   The HA may want the MN to re-establish the SA even if the existing SA
   is still valid.  The HA can indicate this to the MN using a dedicated
   Status Code in a BA (value set to REINIT_SA_WITH_HAC).  As a result,
   the MN SHOULD contact the HAC prior to the SA timing out, and the HAC
   would provision the MN and HAs with a new SA to be used subsequently.

   The SA established between MN and HAC SHALL contain at least the
   following information:

   Mobility SPI:

      This parameter is an SPI used by the MN and the HA to index the SA
      between the MN and the HA.  The HAC is responsible for assigning
      SPIs to MNs.  There is only one SPI for both binding management

      messaging and possible user data protection.  The same SPI is used
      for both directions between the MN and the HA.  The SPI values are
      assigned by the HAC.  The HAC MUST ensure uniqueness of the SPI
      values across all MNs controlled by the HAC.

   MN-HA keys for ciphering:

      A pair of symmetric keys (MN -> HA, HA -> MN) used for ciphering
      Mobile IPv6 traffic between the MN and the HA.  The HAC is
      responsible for generating these keys.  The key generation
      algorithm is specific to the HAC implementation.

   MN-HA shared key for integrity protection:

      A pair of symmetric keys (MN -> HA, HA -> MN) used for integrity
      protecting Mobile IPv6 traffic between the MN and the HA.  This
      includes both binding management messages and reverse tunneled
      user data traffic between the MN and the HA.  The HAC is
      responsible for generating these keys.  The key generation
      algorithm is specific to the HAC implementation.  In case of
      combined algorithms a separate integrity protection key is not
      needed and may be omitted, i.e., the encryption keys SHALL be
      used.

   Security association validity time:

      This parameter represents the validity time for the security
      association.  The HAC is responsible for defining the lifetime
      value based on its policies.  The lifetime may be in the order of
      hours or weeks.  The MN MUST re-contact the HAC before the SA
      validity time ends.

   Security Association Scope:

      This parameter defines whether the security association is applied
      to Mobile IPv6 signaling messages only, or to both Mobile IPv6
      signaling messages and data traffic.

   Selected ciphersuite:

      This parameter is the ciphersuite used to protect the traffic
      between the MN and the HA.  This includes both binding management
      messages and reverse tunneled user data traffic between the MN and
      the HA.  The selected algorithms SHOULD be one of the mutually
      supported ciphersuites of the negotiated TLS version between the
      MN and the HAC.  The HAC is responsible for choosing the mutually
      supported ciphersuite that complies with the policy of the HAC.
      Obviously, the HAs under HAC's management must have at least one

      ciphersuite with the HAC in common and need to be aware of the
      implemented ciphersuites.  The selected ciphersuite is the same
      for both directions (MN -> HA and HA -> MN).

   Sequence numbers:

      A monotonically increasing unsigned sequence number used in all
      protected packets exchanged between the MN and the HA in the same
      direction.  Sequence numbers are maintained per direction, so each
      SA includes two independent sequence numbers (MN -> HA, HA -> MN).
      The initial sequence number for each direction MUST always be set
      to 0 (zero).  Sequence numbers cycle to 0 (zero) when increasing
      beyond their maximum defined value.

4.4.  Bootstrapping of Additional Mobile IPv6 Parameters

   When the MN contacts the HAC to distribute the security related
   information, the HAC may also provision the MN with various Mobile
   IPv6 related bootstrapping information.  Bootstrapping of the
   following information SHOULD at least be possible:

   Home Agent IP Address:

      Concerns both IPv6 and IPv4 home agent addresses.

   Mobile IPv6 Service Port Number:

      The port number where the HA is listening to UDP [RFC0768]
      packets.

   Home Address:

      Concerns both IPv6 and IPv4 Home Addresses.

   Home Link Prefix:

      Concerns the IPv6 Home link prefix and the associated prefix
      length.
   DNS Server Address:

      The address of a DNS server that can be reached via the HA.  DNS
      queries in certain cases cannot be routed to the DNS servers
      assigned by the access network to which the MN is attached and
      hence an additional DNS server address which is reachable via the
      HA needs to be configured.

   The Mobile IPv6 related bootstrapping information is delivered from
   the HAC to the MN over the same TLS protected tunnel as the security

   related information.

4.5.  Protecting Traffic Between Mobile Node and Home Agent

   The same integrity and confidentiality algorithms MUST be used to
   protect both binding management messages and reverse tunneled user
   data traffic between the MN and the HA.  Generally, all binding
   management messages (BUs, BAs and so on) MUST be integrity protected
   and SHOULD be confidentially protected.  The reverse tunneled user
   data traffic SHOULD be equivalently protected.  Generally, the
   requirements stated in [RFC6275] concerning the protection of the
   traffic between the MN and the HA also apply to the mechanisms
   defined by this specification.


5.  Mobile Node to Home Agent Controller Communication

5.1.  Request-response Message Framing over TLS-tunnel

   The MN and the HAC communicate with each other using a simple lock-
   step request-response protocol that is run inside the protected TLS-
   tunnel.  A generic message container framing for the request messages
   and for the response messages is defined.  The message containers are
   only meant to be exchanged on top of connection oriented TLS-layer.
   Therefore, the end of message exchange is determined by the other end
   closing the transport connection (assuming the "application layer"
   has also indicated the completion of the message exchange).  The peer
   initiating the TLS-connection is always sending "Requests" and the
   peer accepting the TLS-connection is always sending "Responses".  The
   format of the message container is shown in Figure 3.

   All data inside the Content portion of the message container MUST be
   encoded using octets.  Fragmentation of message containers is not
   supported, which means one request or response at the "application
   layer" MUST NOT exceed the maximum size allowed by the message
   container format.

               Figure 3: Request-Response Message Container

   The three bit Ver field identifies the protocol version.  The current

   version is 0 i.e. all bits are set to value 0 (zero).

   The Rsrvd field MUST be set to value 0 (zero),

   The Identifier field is meant for matching requests and responses.
   The valid Identifier values are between 1-255.  The value 0 MUST NOT
   be used.  The first request for each communication session between
   the MN and the HAC MUST have the Identifier values set to 1.

   The Length field tells the length of the Content portion of the
   container (i.e.  Reserved octet, Identifier octet and Length field
   are excluded).  The Content portion length MUST always be at least
   one octet up to 65535 octets.  The value is in network order.

5.2.  Request-response Message Content Encoding

   The encoding of the message content is similar to HTTP header
   encoding, and complies to the augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF)
   defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC2616].  All presented hexadecimal
   numbers are in network byte order.  From now on, we use TypeValue
   header (TV-header) term to refer request-response message content
   HTTP-like headers.

5.3.  Request-Response Message Exchange

   The message exchange between the MN and the HAC is a simple lock-step
   request-response type as stated in Section 5.1.  A request message
   includes monotonically increasing Identifier value that is copied to
   the corresponding response message.  Each request MUST have a
   different Identifier value.  Hence, a reliable connection oriented
   transport below the message container framing is assumed.  The number
   of request-response message exchanges MUST NOT exceed 255.

   Each new communication session between the MN and the HAC MUST reset
   the Identifier value to 1.  The MN is also the peer that always sends
   only request messages and the HAC only sends response messages.  Once
   the request-response message exchange completes, the HAC and the MN
   MUST close the transport connection and the corresponding TLS-tunnel.

   In a case of a HAC side error, the HAC MUST send a response back to a
   MN with an appropriate status code and then close the transport
   connection.

   The first request message - MHAuth-Init - (i.e. the Identifier is 1)
   MUST always contain at least the following parameters:

      MN-Identity - See Section 5.5.1.
      Authentication Method - See Section 5.5.2.

   The first response message - MHAuth-Init - (i.e. the Identifier is 1)
   MUST contain at minimum the following parameters:

      Selected authentication Method - See Section 5.5.2.

   The last request message from the MN side - MHAuth-Done - MUST
   contain the following parameters:

      Security Association Scope - See Section 5.6.4.
      Proposed ciphersuites - See Section 5.6.5.
      Message Authenticator - See Section 5.5.5.

   The last response message - MHAuth-Done - that ends the request-
   response message exchange MUST contain the following parameters:

      Status Code - See Section 5.5.4.
      Message Authenticator - See Section 5.5.5.

   And in a case of successful authentication the following additional
   parameters:

      Selected ciphersuite - See Section 5.6.5.
      Security Association Scope - See Section 5.6.4.
      The rest of the security association data - See Section 5.6.

5.4.  Home Agent Controller Discovery

   All bootstrapping information, whether for setting up the SA or for
   bootstrapping Mobile IPv6 specific information, is exchanged between
   the MN and the HAC using the framing protocol defined in Section 5.1.
   The IP address of the HAC MAY be statically configured to the MN or
   may be dynamically discovered using DNS.  In a case of DNS-based HAC
   discovery, the MN either queries an A/AAAA or a SRV record for the
   HAC IP address.  The actual domain name used in queries is up to the
   deployment to decide and out of scope of this specification.

5.5.  Generic Request-Response Parameters

   The grammar used in the following sections is the augmented Backus-
   Naur Form (BNF) same to that used by HTTP [RFC2616].

5.5.1.  Mobile Node Identifier

   An identifier that identifies a MN.  The Mobile Node Identifier is in
   form of a Network Access Identifier (NAI) [RFC4282].

      mn-id = "mn-id" ":" RFC4282-NAI CRLF

5.5.2.  Authentication Method

   The HAC is the peer that mandates the authentication method.  The MN
   sends its authentication method proposal to the HAC.  The HAC, upon
   receipt of the MN proposal returns the selected authentication
   method.  The MN MUST propose at least one authentication method.  The
   HAC MUST select exactly one authentication method, or return an error
   and then close the connection.

      auth-method = "auth-method" ":" a-method *("," a-method) CRLF
      a-method =
           "psk" ; Pre-shared key based authentication
         | "eap" ; EAP-based authentication

5.5.3.  Extensible Authentication Protocol Payload

   Each Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748] message is an
   encoded string of hexadecimal numbers.  The "eap-payload" is
   completely transparent what EAP-method or EAP message is carried
   inside it.  The "eap-payload" can appear in both request and response
   messages:

      eap-payload = "eap-payload" ":" 1*(HEX HEX) CRLF

5.5.4.  Status Code

   The "status-code" MUST only be present in the response message that
   ends the request-response message exchange.  The "status-code"
   follows the principles of HTTP and the definitions found in Section
   10 of RFC 2616 also apply for these status codes listed below:

      status-code = "status-code" ":" status-value CRLF
      status-value =
           "100" ; Continue
         | "200" ; OK
         | "400" ; Bad Request
         | "401" ; Unauthorized
         | "500" ; Internal Server Error
         | "501" ; Not Implemented
         | "503" ; Service Unavailable
         | "504" ; Gateway Time-out

5.5.5.  Message Authenticator

   The "auth" header contains data used for authentication purposes.  It
   MUST be the last TV-header in the message and calculated over the

   whole message till the start of the "msg-header":

      msg-auth = "auth" ":" 1*(HEX HEX) CRLF

5.5.6.  Retry After

      retry-after = "retry-after" ":" rfc1123-date CRLF

5.5.7.  End of Message Content

      end-of-message = 2CRLF

5.5.8.  Random Values

   Random numbers generated by the MN and the HAC, respectively.  The
   length of the random number MUST be 32 octets (before TV-header
   encoding):

      mn-rand = "mn-rand" ":" 32(HEX HEX) CRLF
      hac-rand = "hac-rand" ":" 32(HEX HEX) CRLF

5.6.  Security Association Configuration Parameters

   During the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping, the MN and the HAC negotiate a
   single ciphersuite for protecting the traffic between the MN and the
   HA.  The allowed ciphersuites for this specification are a subset of
   those in TLS v1.2 (see Annex A.5 of [RFC5246]) as per Section 5.6.5.
   This might appear as a constraint as the HA and the HAC may have
   implemented different ciphersuites.  These two nodes are, however,
   assumed to belong to the same administrative domain.  In order to
   avoid exchanging supported MN-HA ciphersuites in the MN-HAC protocol
   and to reuse the TLS ciphersuite negotiation procedure we make this
   simplifying assumption.  The selected ciphersuite MUST provide
   integrity and confidentiality protection.

   Section 5.6.5 provides the mapping from the TLS ciphersuites to the
   integrity and encryption algorithms allowed for MN-HA protection.
   This mapping mainly ignores the authentication algorithm part that is
   not required within the context of this specification.  For example,
   [RFC5246] defines a number of AES based ciphersuites for TLS
   including 'TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA'.  For this specification the
   relevant part is 'AES_128_CBC_SHA'.

   All the parameters described in the following sections apply only to
   a request-response protocol response message to the MN.  The MN has
   no way affecting to the provisioning decision of the HAC.

5.6.1.  Security Parameter Index

   The 28-bit unsigned SPI number identifies the SA used between the MN
   and the HA.  The value 0 (zero) is reserved and MUST NOT be used.
   Therefore, values ranging from 1 to 268435455 are valid.

   The TV-header corresponding to the SPI number is:

      mip6-spi = "mip6-spi" ":" 1*DIGIT CRLF

5.6.2.  MN-HA Shared Keys

   The MN-HA shared integrity (ikey) and encryption (ekey) keys are used
   to protect the traffic between the MN and the HA.  The length of
   these keys depend on the selected ciphersuite.

   The TV-headers that carry these two parameters are:

      mip6-mn-to-ha-ikey = "mip6-mn-to-ha-ikey" ":" 1*(HEX HEX) CRLF
      mip6-ha-to-mn-ikey = "mip6-ha-to-mn-ikey" ":" 1*(HEX HEX) CRLF
      mip6-mn-to-ha-ekey = "mip6-mn-to-ha-ekey" ":" 1*(HEX HEX) CRLF
      mip6-ha-to-mn-ekey = "mip6-ha-to-mn-ekey" ":" 1*(HEX HEX) CRLF

5.6.3.  Security Association Validity Time

   The end of the SA validity time is encoded using the "rfc1123-date"
   format, as defined in Section 3.3.1 of [RFC2616].

   The TV-header corresponding to the SA validity time value is:

      mip6-sa-validity-end = "mip6-sa-validity-end" ":" rfc1123-date
      CRLF

5.6.4.  Security association scope (SAS)

   The SA is applied either to Mobile IPv6 signaling messages only, or
   to both Mobile IPv6 signaling messages and data traffic.  This policy
   MUST be agreed between the MN and HA prior to using the SA.
   Otherwise the receiving side would not be aware of whether the SA
   applies to data traffic and could not decide how to act when
   receiving unprotected packets of PType 1 (see Section 6.4).

      mip6-sas = "mip6-sas" ":" 1DIGIT CRLF

   where a value of "0" indicates that the SA does not protect data
   traffic and a value of "1" indicates that all data traffic MUST be
   protected by the SA.  If the mip6-sas value of an SA is set to 1, any
   packet received with a PType value that does not match the mip6-sas

   value of the SA MUST be silently discarded.

   The HAC is the peer that mandates the used security association
   scope.  The MN sends its proposal to the HAC but eventually the
   security association scope returned from the HAC defines the used
   scope.

5.6.5.  CipherSuites and Ciphersuite-to-Algorithm Mapping

   The ciphersuite negotiation between HAC and MN uses a subset of the
   TLS 1.2 ciphersuites and follows the TLS 1.2 numeric representation
   defined in Annex A.5 of [RFC5246].  The TV-headers corresponding to
   the selected ciphersuite and ciphersuite list are:

      mip6-ciphersuite = "mip6-ciphersuite" ":" csuite CRLF
      csuite = "{" suite "}"
      suite =
           "00" "," "02" ; CipherSuite NULL_SHA           = {0x00,0x02}
         | "00" "," "3B" ; CipherSuite NULL_SHA256        = {0x00,0x3B}
         | "00" "," "0A" ; CipherSuite 3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA   = {0x00,0x0A}
         | "00" "," "2F" ; CipherSuite AES_128_CBC_SHA    = {0x00,0x2F}
         | "00" "," "3C" ; CipherSuite AES_128_CBC_SHA256 = {0x00,0x3C}
      mip6-suitelist = "mip6-suitelist" ":" csuite *("," csuite) CRLF

   All other Ciphersuite values are reserved.

   The following integrity algorithms MUST be supported by all
   implementations:

      HMAC-SHA1-96                    [RFC2404]
      AES-XCBC-MAC-96                 [RFC3566]

   The binding management messages between the MN and HA MUST be
   integrity protected.  Implementations MUST NOT use a NULL integrity
   algorithm.

   The following encryption algorithms MUST be supported:

      NULL                            [RFC2410]
      TripleDES-CBC                   [RFC2451]
      AES-CBC with 128-bit keys       [RFC3602]

   Traffic between MN and HA MAY be encrypted.  Any integrity-only
   CipherSuite makes use of the NULL encryption algorithm.

   Note: In the present version, this document does not consider
   combined algorithms.  The following table provides the mapping of
   each ciphersuite to a combination of integrity and encryption

5.7.  Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping Parameters

   In parallel with the SA bootstrapping, the HAC SHOULD provision the
   MN with relevant Mobile IPv6 related bootstrapping information.

   The following generic BNFs are used to form IP addresses and
   prefixes.  They are used in subsequent sections.

      ip6-addr   = 7( word ":" ) word CRLF
      word       = 1*4HEX
      ip6-prefix = ip6-addr "/" 1*2DIGIT
      ip4-addr   = 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT
      ip4-subnet = ip4-addr "/" 1*2DIGIT

5.7.1.  Home Agent Address

   The HAC MAY provision the MN with an IPv4 or an IPv6 address of a HA,
   or both.

      mip6-haa-ip6 = "mip6-haa-ip6" ":" ip6-addr CRLF
      mip6-haa-ip4 = "mip6-haa-ip4" ":" ip4-addr CRLF

5.7.2.  Mobile IPv6 Service Port Number

   The HAC SHOULD provision the MN with an UDP port number, where the HA
   expects to receive UDP packets.  If this parameter is not present,
   then the IANA reserved port number (HALTSEC) MUST be used instead.

      mip6-port = "mip6-port" ":" 1*5DIGIT CRLF

5.7.3.  Home Addresses and Home Network Prefix

   The HAC MAY provision the MN with an IPv4 or an IPv6 home address, or
   both.  The HAC MAY also provision the MN with its home network

   prefix.

      mip6-ip6-hoa = "mip6-ip6-hoa" ":" ip6-addr CRLF
      mip6-ip4-hoa = "mip6-ip4-hoa" ":" ip4-addr CRLF
      mip6-ip6-hnp = "mip6-ip6-hnp" ":" ip6-prefix CRLF
      mip6-ip4-hnp = "mip6-ip4-hnp" ":" ip4-subnet CRLF

5.7.4.  DNS Server

   The HAC may also provide the MN with DNS server configuration
   options.  These DNS servers are reachable via the home agent.

      dns-ip6 = "dns-ip6" ":" ip6-addr CRLF
      dns-ip4 = "dns-ip4" ":" ip4-addr CRLF

5.8.  Authentication of the Mobile Node

   This section describes the basic operation required for the MN-HAC
   mutual authentication and the channel binding.  The authentication
   protocol described as part of this section is a simple exchange that
   follows the GPSK exchange used by EAP-GPSK [RFC5433].  It is secured
   by the TLS tunnel and is cryptographically bound to the TLS tunnel
   through channel binding based on [RFC5056] and on the channel binding
   type 'tls-server-endpoint' described in [RFC5929].  As a result of
   the channel binding type, this method can only be used with TLS
   ciphersuites that use server certificates and the Certificate
   handshake message.  For example, TLS ciphersuites based on PSK or
   anonymous authentication cannot be used.

   The authentication exchange MUST be performed through the encrypted
   TLS tunnel.  It performs mutual authentication between the MN and the
   HAC based on a pre-shared key (PSK) or based on an EAP-method (see
   Section 5.9).  The PSK protocol is described in this section.  It
   consists of the message exchanges (MHAuth-Init, MHAuth-Mid, MHAuth-
   Done) in which both sides exchange nonces and their identities, and
   compute and exchange a message authenticator 'auth' over the
   previously exchanged values, keyed with the pre-shared key.  The
   MHAuth-Done messages are used to deal with error situations.  Key
   binding with the TLS tunnel is ensured by channel binding of the type
   "tls-server-endpoint" as described by [RFC5929] where the hash of the
   TLS server certificate serves as input to the 'auth' calculation of
   the MHAuth messages.

   Note: The authentication exchange is based on the GPSK exchange used
   by EAP-GPSK.  In comparison to GPSK, it does not support exchanging
   an encrypted container (it always runs through an already protected
   TLS tunnel).  Furthermore, the initial request of the authentication

   endpoint" type) are the same as described in [RFC5929].

   The MN starts by selecting a random number 'mn-rand' and choosing a
   list of supported authentication methods coded in 'auth-method'.  The
   MN sends its identity 'mn-id', 'mn-rand' and 'auth-method' to the HAC
   in MHAuth-Init.  The decision of which authentication method to offer
   and which to pick is policy- and implementation-dependent and,
   therefore, outside the scope of this document.

   In MHAuth-Done, the HAC sends a random number 'hac-rand' and the
   selected ciphersuite.  The selection MUST be one of the MN-supported
   ciphersuites as received in 'ciphersuite-list'.  Furthermore, it
   repeats the received parameters of the MHAuth-Init message 'mn-rand'.
   It computes a message authenticator 'auth' over all the transmitted
   parameters except 'auth' itself.  The HAC calculates 'auth' over all
   parameters and appends it to the message.

   The MN verifies the received MAC and the consistency of the
   identities, nonces, and ciphersuite parameters transmitted in MHAuth-
   Auth.  In case of successful verification, the MN computes a MAC over
   the session parameter and returns it to the HAC in MHAuth-Done.  The
   HAC verifies the received MAC and the consistency of the identities,
   nonces, and ciphersuite parameters transmitted in MHAuth-Init.  If
   the verification is successful, MHAuth-Done is prepared and sent by
   the HAC to confirm successful completion of the exchange.

   'msg-octets' includes all payload parameters of the respective
   message to be signed except the 'auth' payload.  CB-octets is the

   (only required for the "TLS-server-endpoint" type) are the same as
   described in [RFC5929].


6.  Mobile Node to Home Agent communication

6.1.  General

   The following sections describe the packet formats used for the
   traffic between the MN and the HA.  This traffic includes binding
   management messages (for example, BU and BA messages), reverse
   tunneled and encrypted user data, and reverse tunneled plain text
   user data.  This specification defines a generic packet format, where
   everything is encapsulated inside UDP.  See Section 6.3 and
   Section 6.4 for detailed illustrations of the corresponding packet
   formats.

   The Mobile IPv6 service port number is where the HA expects to
   receive UDP packets.  The same port number is used for both binding
   management messages and user data packets.  The reason for
   multiplexing data and control messages over the same port number is
   due to the possibility of Network Address and Port Translators
   located along the path between the MN and the HA.  The Mobile IPv6
   service MAY use any ephemeral port number as the UDP source port, and
   MUST use the Mobile IPv6 service port number as the UDP destination
   port.  The Mobile IPv6 service port is either dynamically assigned to

Internet-Draft     TLS-based MIPv6 Security Framework         March 2012


   the MN during the bootstrapping phase (i.e. the mip6-port parameter)
   or in absence of the bootstrapping parameter the IANA reserved port
   (HALTSEC) MUST be used.

   The encapsulating UDP header is immediately followed by a 4-bit
   Packet Type (PType) field that defines whether the packet contains an
   encrypted mobility management message or a, an encrypted user data
   packet, or a plain text user data packet.

   The Packet Type field is followed by a 28-bit SPI value, which
   identifies the correct SA concerning the encrypted packet.  For any
   packet that is neither integrity protected nor encrypted (i.e. no SA
   is applied by the originator) the SPI MUST be set to 0 (zero).
   Mobility management messages MUST always be at least integrity
   protected.  Hence, mobility management messages MUST NOT be sent with
   a SPI value of 0 (zero).

   There is always only one SPI per MN-HA mobility session and the same
   SPI is used for all types of protected packets independent of the
   direction.

   The SPI value is followed by a 32-bit Sequence Number value that is
   used to identify retransmissions of protected messages (integrity
   protected or both integrity protected and encrypted, see Figures 7
   and 8) .  Each endpoint in the security association maintains two
   "current" Sequence Numbers: the next one to be used for a packet it
   initiates and the next one it expects to see in a packet from the
   other end.  If the MN and the HA ends initiate very different numbers
   of messages, the Sequence Numbers in the two directions can be very
   different.  In a case data protection is not used (see Figure 9), the
   Sequence Number MUST be set to 0 (zero).  Note that the HA SHOULD
   initiate a re-establishement of the SA before any of the Sequence
   Number cycle.

   Finally, the Sequence Number field is followed by the data portion,
   whose content is identified by the Packet Type.  The data portion may
   be protected.

6.2.  PType and Security Parameter Index

   The PType is a 4-bit field that indicates the Packet Type (PType) of
   the UDP encapsulated packet.  The PType is followed by a a 28-bit SPI
   value.  The PType and the SPI fields are treated as one 32-bit field
   during the integrity protection calculation.

            Figure 6: Security Parameter Index with Packet Type

   A SPI value of 0 (zero) indicates a plaintext packet.  If the packet
   is integrity protected or both integrity protected and encrypted, the
   SPI value MUST be different from 0.  When the SPI value is set to 0,
   then the PType MUST also be 0.

6.3.  Binding Management Message Formats

   The binding management messages that are only meant to be exchanged
   between the MN and the HA MUST be integrity protected and MAY be
   encrypted.  They MUST use the packet format shown in Figure 7.

   All packets that are specific to the Mobile IPv6 protocol, contain a
   Mobility Header (as defined in Section 6.1.1. of RFC 6275), and are
   used between the MN and the HA use the packet format shown in
   Figure 7.  (This means that some Mobile IPv6 mobility management
   messages, such as the HoTI message, are treated as data packets and
   using encapsulation described in Section 6.4 and shown in Figures 8
   and 9).

       Figure 7: UDP Encapsulated Binding Management Message Format

   The PType value 8 (eight) identifies that the UDP encapsulated packet
   contains a RFC 6275 defined Mobility Header and other relevant IPv6
   extension headers.  Note, there is no additional IP header inside the
   encapsulated part.  The Next Header field MUST be set to value of the
   first encapsulated header.  The encapsulated headers follow the
   natural IPv6 and Mobile IPv6 extension header alignment and
   formatting rules.

   The Padding, Pad Length, Next Header and ICV fields follow the rules
   of Section 2.4 to 2.8 of [RFC4303] unless otherwise stated in this
   document.  For a SPI value of 0 (zero) that indicates an unprotected
   packet, the Padding, Pad Length, Next Header and ICV fields MUST NOT
   be present.

   The source and destination IP addresses of the outer IP header (i.e.
   the src-addr and the dst-addr in Figure 7) use the current care-of
   address of the MN and the HA address.

6.4.  Reverse Tunneled User Data Packet Formats

   There are two types of reverse tunneled user data packets between the
   MN and the HA.  Those that are integrity protected and encrypted and
   those that are plaintext.  The MN or the HA decide whether to apply
   integrity protection and encryption to a packet or to send it in
   plaintext based on the mip6-sas value in the SA.  If the mip6-sas is
   set to 1 the originator MUST NOT send any plaintext packet, and the
   receiver MUST silently discard any packet with the PType set to 0
   (unprotected).  It is RECOMMENDED to apply confidentiality and
   integrity protection of user data traffic.  The reverse tunneled IPv4
   or IPv6 user data packets are encapsulated as-is inside the 'Payload
   Data' shown in Figures 8 and 9.

       Figure 8: UDP Encapsulated Protected User Data Packet Format

   The PType value 1 (one) identifies that the UDP encapsulated packet
   contains an encrypted tunneled IPv4/IPv6 user data packet.  The Next
   Header field header MUST be set to value corresponding the tunneled
   IP packet (e.g., 41 for IPv6).

   The Padding, Pad Length, Next Header and ICV fields follow the rules
   of Section 2.4 to 2.8 of [RFC4303] unless otherwise stated in this
   document.  For a SPI value of 0 (zero) that indicates an unprotected
   packet, the Padding, Pad Length, Next Header and ICV fields MUST NOT
   be present.

   The source and destination IP addresses of the outer IP header (i.e.,
   the src-addr and the dst-addr in Figure 8) use the current care-of
   address of the MN and the HA address.  The ESP protected inner IP
   header, which is not shown in Figure 8, uses the home address of the
   MN and the correspondent node (CN) address.

     Figure 9: UDP Encapsulated Non-Protected User Data Packet Format

   The PType value 0 (zero) identifies that the UDP encapsulated packet
   contains a plaintext tunneled IPv4/IPv6 user data packet.  Also the
   SPI and the Sequence Number fields MUST be set to 0 (zero).

   The source and destination IP addresses of the outer IP header (i.e.,
   the src-addr and the dst-addr in Figure 9) use the current care-of
   address of the MN and the HA address.  The plain text inner IP header
   uses the home address of the MN and the CN address.


7.  Route Optimization

   Mobile IPv6 route optimization as described in [RFC6275] is not

   affected by this specification.  Route optimization is possible only
   between an IPv6 MN and CN.  UDP encapsulation of signaling and data
   traffic is only between the MN and HA.  The return routability
   signaling messages such as HoTI/HoT and CoTI/CoT [RFC6275] are
   treated as data packets and encapsulation, when needed, is as per the
   description in Section 6.4 of this specification.  The data packets
   between an MN and CN which have successfully completed the return
   routability test and created the appropriate entries in their binding
   cache are not UDP encapsulated using the packet formats defined in
   this specification but follow the [RFC6275] specification.


8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  New Registry: Packet Type

   IANA is requested to create a new registry under the [RFC6275] Mobile
   IPv6 parameters registry for the Packet Type as described in
   Section 6.1.

   Packet Type                       | Value
   ----------------------------------+----------------------------------
   non-encrypted IP packet           | 0
   encrypted IP packet               | 1
   mobility header                   | 8

   Following the allocation policies from [RFC5226] new values for the
   Packet Type AVP MUST be assigned based on the "RFC Required" policy.

8.2.  Status Codes

   A new Status Code (to be used in BA messages) is reserved for the
   cases where the HA wants to indicate to the MN that it needs to re-
   establish the SA information with the HAC.  The Result Code is
   reserved from the 0-127 code space in [RFC6275] Status Codes
   registry:

       REINIT_SA_WITH_HAC       TBD1

8.3.  Port Numbers

   A new port number (HALTSEC) for UDP packets is reserved from the
   existing PORT NUMBERS registry.

       HALTSEC                  TBD2

9.  Security Considerations

   This document describes and uses a number of building blocks that
   introduce security mechanisms and need to inter-work in a secure
   manner.

   The following building blocks are considered from a security point of
   view:

   1.  Discovery of the HAC
   2.  Authentication and MN-HA SA establishment executed between the MN
       and the HAC (PSK or EAP-based) through a TLS tunnel
   3.  Protection of MN-HA communication
   4.  AAA Interworking

9.1.  Discovery of the HAC

   No dynamic procedure for discovering the HAC by the MN is described
   in this document.  As such, no specific security considerations apply
   to the scope of this document.

9.2.  Authentication and Key Exchange executed between the MN and the
      HAC

   This document describes a simple authentication and MN-HA SA
   negotiation exchange over TLS.  The TLS procedures remain unchanged;
   however, channel binding is provided.

   Authentication:  Server-side certificate based authentication MUST be
      performed using TLS 1.2 [RFC5246].  The MN MUST verify the HAC's
      TLS server certificate, using either subjectAltName extension
      [RFC5280] dNSName identities as described in [RFC6125] or
      subjectAltName iPAddress identities.  In case of iPAddress
      identities the MN MUST check the IP address of the TLS connection
      against these iPAddress identities and SHOULD reject the
      connection if none of the iPAddress identities match the
      connection.  In case of dNSName identities the rules and
      guidelines defined in [RFC6125] apply here, with the following
      considerations:

      *  Support for DNS-ID identifier type (the dNSName identity in the
         subjectAltName extension) is REQUIRED in the HAC and the MN TLS
         implementations.
      *  DNS names in the HAC server certificates MUST NOT contain the
         wildcard character "*".
      *  The CN-ID MUST NOT be used for authentication within the rules
         described in [RFC6125].




Korhonen, et al.       Expires September 13, 2012              [Page 30]

Internet-Draft     TLS-based MIPv6 Security Framework         March 2012


      *  The MN MUST set its "reference identifier" to the DNS name of
         the HAC.

      The client-side authentication may depend on the specific
      deployment and is therefore not mandated.  Note that TLS-PSK
      [RFC4279] cannot be used in conjunction with the methods described
      in section 5.8 and 5.9 of this document due to the limitations of
      the channel binding type used.

      Through the protected TLS tunnel, an additional authentication
      exchange is performed that provides client-side or mutual
      authentication and exchanges SA parameters and optional
      configuration data to be used in the subsequent protection of
      MN-HA communication.  The additional authentication exchange can
      either be PSK-based (section 5.8) or EAP-based (section 5.9).
      Both exchanges are always performed within the protected TLS
      tunnel and MUST NOT be used as standalone protocols.

      The simple PSK-based authentication exchange provides mutual
      authentication and follows the GPSK exchange used by EAP-GPSK
      [RFC5433] and has similar properties, although some features of
      GPSK like the exchange of a protected container are not supported.

      The EAP-based authentication exchange simply defines message
      containers to allow carrying the EAP packets between the MN and
      the HAC.  In principle, any EAP method can be used.  However, it
      is strongly recommended to use only EAP methods that provide
      mutual authentication and that derive keys including an MSK key in
      compliance with [RFC3748].

      Both exchanges use channel binding with the TLS tunnel.  The
      channel binding type 'TLS-server-endpoint' as per [RFC5929] MUST
      be used.

   Dictionary Attacks:  All messages of the authentication exchanges
      specified in this document are protected by TLS.  However, any
      implementation SHOULD assume that the properties of the
      authentication exchange are the same as for GPSK [RFC5433] in case
      the PSK-based method as per section 5.8. is used, and are the same
      as those of the underlying EAP method in case the EAP-based
      exchange as per section 5.9 is used.

   Replay Protection:  The underlying TLS protection provides protection
      against replays.

Internet-Draft     TLS-based MIPv6 Security Framework         March 2012


   Key Derivation and Key Strength:  For TLS, the TLS specific
      considerations apply unchanged.  For the authentication exchanges
      defined in this document, no key derivation step is performed as
      the MN-HA keys are generated by the HAC and are distributed to the
      MN through the secure TLS connection.

   Key Control:  No joint key control for MN-HA keys is provided by this
      version of the specification.

   Lifetime:  The TLS-protected authentication exchange between the MN
      and the HAC is only to bootstrap keys and other parameters for
      usage with MN-HA security.  The SAs that contain the keys have an
      associated lifetime.  The usage of Transport Layer Security (TLS)
      Session Resumption without Server-Side State, described in
      [RFC5077], provides the ability for the MN to minimize the latency
      of future exchanges towards the HA without having to keep state at
      the HA itself.

   Denial of Service Resistance:  The level of resistance against denial
      of service attacks SHOULD be considered the same as for common TLS
      operation, as TLS is used unchanged.  For the PSK-based
      authentication exchange, no additional factors are known.  For the
      EAP-based authentication exchange, any considerations regarding
      denial-of-service resistance specific to the chosen EAP method are
      expected to be applicable and need to be be taken into account.

   Session Independence:  Each individual TLS protocol run is
      independent from any previous exchange based on the security
      properties of the TLS handshake protocol.  However, several PSK or
      EAP-based authentication exchanges can be performed across the
      same TLS connection.

   Fragmentation:  TLS runs on top of TCP and no fragmentation specific
      considerations apply to the MN-HAC authentication exchanges.

   Channel Binding:  Both the PSK and the EAP-based exchanges use
      channel binding with the TLS tunnel.  The channel binding type
      'TLS-server-endpoint' as per [RFC5929] MUST be used.

   Fast Reconnect:  This protocol provides session resumption as part of
      TLS and optionally the support for [RFC5077].  No fast reconnect
      is supported for the PSK-based authentication exchange.  For the
      EAP-based authentication exchange, availability of fast reconnect
      depends on the EAP method used.

Internet-Draft     TLS-based MIPv6 Security Framework         March 2012


   Identity Protection:  Based on the security properties of the TLS
      tunnel, passive user identity protection is provided.  An attacker
      acting as man-in-the-middle in the TLS connection would be able to
      observe the MN identity value sent in MHAuth-Init messages.

   Protected Ciphersuite Negotiation:  This protocol provides
      ciphersuite negotiation based on TLS.

   Confidentiality:  Confidentiality protection of payloads exchanged
      between the MN and the HAC are protected with the TLS Record
      Layer.  TLS ciphersuites with confidentiality and integrity
      protection MUST be negotiated and used in order to exchange
      security sensitive material inside the TLS connection.

   Cryptographic Binding:  No cryptographic bindings are provided by
      this protocol specified in this document.

   Perfect Forward Secrecy:  Perfect forward secrecy is provided with
      appropriate TLS ciphersuites.

   Key confirmation:  Key confirmation of the keys established with TLS
      is provided by the TLS Record Layer when the keys are used to
      protect the subsequent TLS exchange.


9.3.  Protection of MN and HA Communication

   Authentication:  Data origin authentication is provided for the
      communication between the MN and the HA.  The chosen level of
      security of this authentication depends on the selected
      ciphersuite.  Entity authentication is offered by the MN to HAC
      protocol exchange.

   Dictionary Attacks:  The concept of dictionary attacks is not
      applicable to the MN-HA communication as the keying material used
      for this communication is randomly created by the HAC and its
      length depends on the chosen cryptographic algorithms.

   Replay Protection:  Replay protection for the communication between
      the MN and the HA is provided based on sequence numbers and
      follows the design of IPsec ESP.

   Key Derivation and Key Strength:  The strength of the keying material
      established for the communication between the MN and the HA is
      selected based on the negotiated ciphersuite (based on the MN-HAC
      exchange) and the key created by the HAC.  The randomness
      requirements for security described in RFC 4086 [RFC4086] are
      applicable to the key generation by the HAC.

Internet-Draft     TLS-based MIPv6 Security Framework         March 2012


   Key Control:  The keying material established during the MN-HAC
      protocol exchange for subsequent protection of the MN-HA
      communication is created by the HA and therefore no joint key
      control is provided for it.

   Key Naming:  For the MN-HA communication the security associations
      are indexed with the help of the SPI and additionally based on the
      direction (in-bound communication or out-bound communication).

   Lifetime:  The lifetime of the MN-HA security associations is based
      on the value in the mip6-sa-validity-end header field exchanged
      during the MN-HAC exchange.  The HAC controls the SA lifetime.

   Denial of Service Resistance:  For the communication between the MN
      and the HA there are no heavy cryptographic operations (such as
      public key computations).  As such, there are no DoS concerns.

   Session Independence:  Sessions are independent from each other when
      new keys are created by via the MN-HAC protocol.  A new MN-HAC
      protocol run produces fresh and unique keying material for
      protection of the MN-HA communication.

   Fragmentation:  There is no additional fragmentation support provided
      beyond what is offered by the network layer.

   Channel Binding:  Channel binding is not applicable to the MN-HA
      communication.

   Fast Reconnect:  The concept of fast reconnect is not applicable to
      the MN-HA communication.

   Identity Protection:  User identities SHOULD NOT be exchanged between
      the MN and the HA.  In a case binding management messages contain
      the user identity, the messages SHOULD be confidentiality
      protected.

   Protected Ciphersuite Negotiation:  The MN-HAC protocol provides
      protected ciphersuite negotiation through a secure TLS connection.

   Confidentiality:  Confidentiality protection of payloads exchanged
      between the MN and the HAC (for Mobile IPv6 signaling and
      optionally for the data traffic) is provided utilizing algorithms
      negotiated during the MN-HAC exchange.

   Cryptographic Binding:  No cryptographic bindings are provided by
      this protocol specified in this document.

   Perfect Forward Secrecy:  Perfect forward secrecy is provided when
      the MN bootstraps new keying material with the help of the MN-HAC
      protocol (assuming that a proper TLS ciphersuite is used).

   Key confirmation:  Key confirmation of the MN-HA keying material
      conveyed from the HAC to the MN is provided when the first packets
      are exchanged between the MN and the HA (in both directions as two
      different keys are used).

9.4.  AAA Interworking

   The AAA backend infrastructure interworking is not defined in this
   document and therefore out-of-scope.
