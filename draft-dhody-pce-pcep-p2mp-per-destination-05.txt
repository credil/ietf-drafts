   Supporting Explicit Inclusion or Exclusion of Abstract Nodes for a
 Subset of P2MP Destinations in Path Computation Element Communication
                            Protocol (PCEP).

Abstract

   The ability to determine paths of point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) is one the key
   requirements for Path Computation Element (PCE).  [RFC6006] and
   [PCE-P2MP-PROCEDURES] describes these mechanisms for intra and inter
   domain path computation via PCE(s).

   This document describes the motivation and PCEP extension for
   explicitly specifying abstract nodes for inclusion or exclusion for a
   subset of destinations during P2MP path computation via PCE(s).

1.  Introduction

   The PCE architecture is defined in [RFC4655].  [RFC5862] lay out the
   requirements for PCEP to support P2MP path computation.  [RFC6006]
   describe an extension to PCEP to compute optimal constrained intra-
   domain (G)MPLS P2MP TE LSPs.  [PCE-P2MP-PROCEDURES] describes the
   mechanism for inter-domain P2MP path computation.

   Further [RFC6006] describes mechanism to specify a list of nodes that
   can be used as branch nodes or a list of nodes that cannot be used as
   branch nodes via Branch Node Capability (BNC) object.  The BNC object

   is used to specify which nodes have the capability to act as a branch
   nodes or which nodes lack the capabilty.  It supports IPv4 and IPv6
   prefix sub-objects only.

   This document explains the need to add the capability to explicitly
   specify any abstract nodes (not just nodes with branch node
   capabiltiy) for inclusion or exclusion for a subset of destinations.

   [PCE-P2MP-PROCEDURES] describes the core-tree procedure to compute
   inter-domain P2MP tree.  It assumes that, due to deployment and
   commercial limitations, the sequence of domains for a path (the path
   domain tree) will be known in advance.  For a group of destination
   which belong to a particular destination domain, the domain-sequence
   needs to be encoded separately as described in [DOMAIN-SEQ].  The
   mechanism, as described in this document, of explicitly specifying
   abstract nodes for inclusion or exclusion for a subset of
   destinations can be used for this purpose, where abstract nodes are
   domains.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   XRO:  Exclude Route Object.

3.  Motivation

3.1.  Domain Sequence Tree in Inter Domain P2MP Path Computation

   [PCE-P2MP-PROCEDURES] describes the core-tree procedure for inter-
   domain path computation.  The procedure assumes that the sequence of
   domains for a path (the path domain tree) will be known in advance
   due to deployment and commercial limitations (e.g., inter-AS peering
   agreements).

   In the Figure 1 below, D1 is the root domain; D5 and D6 are the
   destination domains.  The ingress is A in domain D1; egresses are X,
   Y in Domain D6 and Z in Domain D5.

                        -----------                      ----------

                     Figure 1: Domain Topology Example

   In the Figure 2 below, the P2MP tree spans 5 domains.  Destination in
   D6 (X and Y) would use the domain-sequence: D1-D3-D4-D6; and
   destination in D5 (Z) would use the domain-sequence: D1-D3-D4-D5.

                      Figure 2: Domain Sequence Tree

   Since destinations in different destination domain will have
   different domain sequence within the domain tree, it requires
   following encoding-

   o  Destination X and Y: D1-D3-D4-D6

   o  Destination Z : D1-D3-D4-D5

   An extension in P2MP Path Computation request is needed to support
   this.  (Refer Section 4.2)

   The abstract nodes MAY include (but not limited to) domain subobjects
   AS number and IGP Area as described in [DOMAIN-SEQ].

   [PCE-P2MP-PROCEDURES] also mentions PCE-sequence (i.e. list of PCE
   for each domain in the path domain tree).  [RFC5886] specify PCE-ID
   object (used to specify a PCE's IP address) and <pce-list> (list of
   PCE or PCE-sequence).  Like domain-sequence as explained above, PCE-
   sequence will be different for different destinations and thus should
   be encoded per destination.

3.2.  Explicit inclusion or exclusion of abstract nodes

   [RFC6006] describes four possible types of leaves in a P2MP request
   encoded in P2MP END-POINTS object.

   o  New leaves to add

   o  Old leaves to remove

   o  Old leaves whose path can be modified/reoptimized

   o  Old leaves whose path must be left unchanged

   [RFC6006] only allows to encode a list of nodes that have (or have
   not) the branch node capability by using the Branch Node Capability
   (BNC) Object.  This object apply to all destinations (old and new) in
   the P2MP tree.

Internet-Draft       EXPLICIT-INC-EXC-ABSTRACT-NODES        October 2013


   For an existing P2MP tree with an overloaded branch node, when adding
   a set of new leaves, administrator may want to exclude that
   particular branch node to balance the final P2MP tree.  This cannot
   be achieved via the BNC object but by explicitly excluding a
   particular node or including a different node, for the P2MP END-
   POINTS object for new leaves only.

   Administrator at the Ingress can exert stronger control by providing
   explicit inclusion or exclusion of any abstract nodes (not limited to
   specifying nodes with branch node capability) for a group (subset) of
   destinations and not all destinations.

4.  Detailed Description

4.1.  Objective

   [RFC6006] defines Request Message Format and Objects, along with
   <end-point-rro-pair-list>.  This section introduce the use of <pce-
   list>, <IRO> and <XRO> which are added to the <end-point-rro-pair-
   list>.

   To allow abstract nodes to be explicitly included or excluded for a
   subset of destinations (encoded in one <END-POINTS> object), changes
   are made as shown below.

   The abstract node (encoded as subobject in <IRO> and <XRO>) MAY be an
   absolute hop, IP-Prefix, Autonomous system or IGP Area.  The
   subobjects are described in [RFC3209], [RFC3477], [RFC4874] and
   [DOMAIN-SEQ].

   Note that one P2MP Path request can have multiple <END-POINTS>
   objects and each P2MP <END-POINTS> object may have multiple
   destinations, the <pce-list>, <IRO> and <XRO> is applied for all
   destinations in one such P2MP <END-POINTS> object.

4.2.  Request Message Format

   The format of PCReq message is modified as follows:

           <PCReq Message>::= <Common Header>
                              <request>
           where:
           <request>::= <RP>
                        <end-point-pce-iro-xro-rro-pair-list>
                        [<OF>]
                        [<LSPA>]
                        [<BANDWIDTH>]
                        [<metric-list>]

Internet-Draft       EXPLICIT-INC-EXC-ABSTRACT-NODES        October 2013


                        [<IRO>]
                        [<LOAD-BALANCING>]

           where:
           <end-point-pce-iro-xro-rro-pair-list>::=
                        <END-POINTS>
                        [<pce-list>]
                        [<IRO>]
                        [<XRO>]
                        [<RRO-List>][<BANDWIDTH>]
                        [<end-point-pce-iro-xro-rro-pair-list>]

           <pce-list>::=<PCE-ID>[<pce-list>]

           <RRO-List>::=<RRO>[<BANDWIDTH>][<RRO-List>]

           <metric-list>::=<METRIC>[<metric-list>]


   From [RFC6006] usage of <end-point-rro-pair-list> is changed to <end-
   point-pce-iro-xro-rro-pair-list> in this document.

   [RFC6006] describes Branch Node Capability (BNC) Object which is
   different from the use of <IRO> and <XRO> to specify inclusion/
   exclusion of abstract nodes for a subset of destinations as described
   here.

   <pce-list> can be used to specify the Pce-sequence instead of domain-
   sequence.

4.3.  Backward Compatibility

   A legacy implementation that does not support explicit inclusion or
   exclusion of abstract nodes for a subset of P2MP destinations will
   act according to the procedures set out in [RFC5440], that is it will
   find the P2MP Path Request message out of order with respect to the
   format specified in [RFC6006].

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no new IANA allocation in this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   PCEP security mechanisms as described in [RFC5440], [RFC6006] and
   [PCE-P2MP-PROCEDURES] are applicable for this document.

Internet-Draft       EXPLICIT-INC-EXC-ABSTRACT-NODES        October 2013


   The new explicit inclusion or exclusion of abstract nodes for a
   subset of P2MP destination defined in this document allow finer and
   more specific control of the path computed by a PCE.  Such control
   increases the risk if a PCEP message is intercepted, modified, or
   spoofed because it allows the attacker to exert control over the path
   that the PCE will compute or to make the path computation impossible.
   Therefore, the security techniques described in [RFC5440], [RFC6006]
   and [PCE-P2MP-PROCEDURES] are considered more important.

   Note, however, that the route exclusion mechanisms also provide the
   operator with the ability to route around vulnerable parts of the
   network and may be used to increase overall network security.

7.  Manageability Considerations

7.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not add any new control
   function/policy requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC6006].

7.2.  Information and Data Models

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new MIB
   requirements.

7.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC6006].

7.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC6006].

7.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any requirements on
   other protocols in addition to those already listed in [RFC6006].
