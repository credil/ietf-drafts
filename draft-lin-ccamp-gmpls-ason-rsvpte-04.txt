The Generalized MultiProtocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite of
protocol specifications has been defined to provide support for
different technologies as well as different applications.  These
include support for requesting TDM connections based on Synchronous
Optical NETwork/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) as
well as Optical Transport Networks (OTNs).

This document concentrates on the signaling aspects of the GMPLS
suite of protocols, specifically GMPLS signaling using Resource
Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE).  It
proposes additional extensions to these signaling protocols to
support the capabilities of an ASON network.

This document proposes appropriate extensions towards the resolution
of additional requirements identified and communicated by the ITU-T
Study Group 15 in support of ITU's ASON standardization effort.
