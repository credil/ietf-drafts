          Obsoleting the IPv6 Endpoint Identifier (EID) Option
               draft-gont-intarea-obsolete-eid-option-02

Abstract

   This document formally deprecates the IPv6 Endpoint Identification
   (EID) option (hex value 0x8a), thus cleaning up the corresponding
   IANA registry.

Internet-Draft       Obsoleting the IPv6 EID Option        November 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Endpoint Identification option (hex value 0x8a)
   [draft-ietf-nimrod-eid] was meant to convey topologically-independent
   endpoint identification information between source and destination
   endpoints, and was used with the Nimrod routing architecture
   [NIMROD-DOC] to convey Nimrod EIDs.  This option has never seen
   widespread deployment, and therefore this document instructs IANA to
   change the "Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options" registry
   [IANA-IPV6-PARAMETERS] accordingly (marking option 0x8a as
   "Obsolete"), thus cleaning up the corresponding registry.

2.  Security Considerations

   This document does not modify the security properties of the IPv6
   option being deprecated.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The "Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options" registry
   [IANA-IPV6-PARAMETERS] contains the list of the currently assigned
   IPv6 option numbers.  This document formally deprecates the Endpoint
   Identification option, and requests IANA to mark it as such and
   provide a reference to this document in the corresponding registry
   [IANA-IPV6-PARAMETERS].
