Abstract

   This document describes the scenarios and requirements of separating
   CAPWAP Data and Control plane.  This specification provides a CAPWAP
   extension to allow two distinct AC component: AC-DP (AC-Data Plane)
   and AC-CP (AC-Control Plane).  AC-DP handles all user payload with
   the exception of layer 2 management frames between the AC and user
   such as IEEE 802.11 association, authentication, probe, Action Frame.
   AC-CP handles all control messages between the WTP and AC.  In
   addition, the AC-CP wil handle user payload related to layer-2
   management frames such as those mentioned above.

1.  Introduction

   Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) was
   designed as an interoperable protocol between the wireless access
   point and the access controller.  This architecture makes it possible
   for the access controller to manage a huge number of wireless access
   points.  With the goals and requirements established in[RFC4564] ,
   CAPWAP protocols were specified in [RFC5415] , [RFC5416]and
   [RFC5417].

   The specificaitons mentioned above mainly design the different
   control message types used by the AC to control multiple WTPs.
   CAPWAP specifies that all user payload is transported on the CAPWAP-
   DATA channel.  As an example, EAP messages, as key protocol exchange
   elements in the WLAN architecture also need to be encapsulated in the
   CAPWAP-DATA.  The CAPWAP protocol does not specify how to encapsulate
   EAP message in its control plane.  As a result, the protocol does not
   allow for splitting the CAPWAP control and data plane where control
   messages

   There are multiple ways of meeting the above requirements.  This
   document first analyzes the capability of current CAPWAP solutions

   and proposes ways to working around the problem without changing
   existing specifications.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

1.2.  Terminology

   Access Controller (AC): The network entity that provides WTP access
   to the network infrastructure in the data plane, control plane,
   management plane, or a combination therein.

   Access Point (AP): the same with Wireless Termination Point (WTP),
   The physical or network entity that contains an RF antenna and
   wireless Physical Layer (PHY) to transmit and receive station traffic
   for wireless access networks.

   CAPWAP Control Plane: A bi-directional flow over which CAPWAP Control
   packets are sent and received.

   CAPWAP Data Plane: A bi-directional flow over which CAPWAP Data
   packets are sent and received.

   EAP: Extensible Authentication Protocol, the EAP framework is
   specified in [RFC3748].

2.  Scenario and Analysis

   The following figure shows where and how the problem arises.  In many
   operators' network, the Access Controller is placed remotely at the
   central data center.  In order to avoid the traffic aggregation at
   the AC, the data traffic from the AP is directed to the Access Router
   (AR).  In this scenario, the CAPWAP-CTL plane and CAPWAP-DATA plane
   are separated from each other.

   Note: a powerful AC that aggregates the data flows is not a long-term
   solution to the problem.  Because operators always plan the network
   capacity at a certain level, but with the air interface bandwidth
   increasing (e.g., from 11g to 11n and 11ac), and the increasing
   number of access requests on each WTP, the AC may not scale to meet
   the requirements.

         Figure 1: Split between CAPWAP-CTL and CAPWAP-DATA Plane

   Because there are no explict message types to support the
   encapsulation of EAP packets (and more generally layer 2 management
   frames) in the CAPWAP-CTL plane, the EAP messages are tunneled via
   the CAPWAP-DATA plane to the AR.  AR would act as the authenticator
   in the EAP framework.  After authentication, the AR receives the EAP
   keying message for the session.  However, this mode of operation
   would undermine the main benefit of having the AC .as the centralized
   entity for authentication and policy.

   Another scenario is the third-party WLAN deployment scenario, in
   which the access network is a rental property from an broadband
   operator different from the one who provides authentication services.
   As shown in Figure 2, The AP is broadcasting a SSID of the Operator
   #1, say "Operator-1-WLAN", but broadband access network is provided
   by another Operator #2.  To authenticate the users of operator one,
   the users should be authenticated by the AC in operator one.  The
   data traffic can be routed locally with the access router of operator
   #2.  In this case, there is also a need of separation between CAPWAP-
   CTL and CAPWAP-DATA traffics.

3.  Analysis of Local Bridging Model

   In the Local-MAC model defined in [RFC5416] Section 2.2.2, it says
   that:

   "The WTP MAY locally bridge client data frames (and provide the
   necessary encryption and decryption services).  The WTP MAY also
   tunnel client data frames to the AC, using 802.3 frame tunnel mode or
   802.11 frame tunnel mode."

   Some have rightly suggested that the Local-MAC model provides a way
   to separate Data and Control Plane.  In this case where the WTP can
   locally bridge the user traffic (wihtout any CAPWAP encapsulation).
   EAP and other management traffic can still be carried over the
   CAPWAP-DATA tunnel between the WTP and AC.  The limitation of this
   behavior is two fold: This requries the Access Router (that will
   apply policy, etc) to be on the same Layer-2 network as the WTP.  In
   many deployments, the traffic would need to be tunneled between the
   WTP and the Access Router that applies the policy.  Second, without
   outer layer CAPWAP Data header, charging and controlling policies
   could not be applied to the data plane.

   The Figure 3 shows this case where WTP encapsulates EAP messages into
   CAPWAP-DATA plane but locally bridges data frames.

4.  Multiple CAPWAP Data Tunnels

   A proposed solution is to create multiple CAPWAP-DATA tunnels.  As
   shown in Figure 4, the WTP encapsulates all control messages between
   the WTP and AC in teh CAPWAP-Control tunnel.  In addition, all Layer
   2 management frames (EAP, etc) are also transported in the CAPWAP-
   DATA tunnel between WTP and AC-CP.  In addition, WTP encapsulates all
   non-management user payload into a secondary CAPWAP-DATA tunnel
   between WTP and AC-DP.

   This brings up issues related to setting up of the secondary data
   tunnel, such as how does the WTP discover the IP address of AC-DP,

   and what security creedentials are used to setup the tunnel.  We plan
   to address this in the next version of this draft.
