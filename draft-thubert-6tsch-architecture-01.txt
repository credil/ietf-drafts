Introduction   The emergence of radio technology enabled a large variety of new   types of devices to be interconnected, at a very low marginal cost   compared to wire, at any range from Near Field to interplanetary   distances, and in circumstances where wiring could be less than   practical, for instance rotating devices.Thubert, Assimiti & WattExpires October 19, 2013                [Page 2]Internet-Draft             6tsch-architecture                 April 2013   At the same time, a new breed of Time Sensitive Networks is being   developped to enable traffic that is highly sensitive to jitter and   quite sensitive to latency.  Such traffic is not limited to voice and   video, but also includes command and control operations such as found   in industrial automation or in-vehicule sensors and actuators.   At IEEE802.1, the "Audio/Video Task Group", was renamed TSN for Time   Sensitive Networking to address Deterministic Ethernet.  The   IEEE802.15.4 Medium Access Control MAC) has evolved with   IEEE802.15.4e that provides in particular  the Time Slotted Channel   Hopping (TSCH) mode for industrial-type applications.   Though at a different time scale, both standards provide   Deterministic capabilities to the point that a packet that pertains   to a certain flow will cross the network from node to node following   a very precise schedule, like a train leaves intermediate stations at   precise times along its path.  The time slotted aspect reduces   collisions, and saves energy, and enables to more closely engineer   the network for deterministic properties.  The channel hopping aspect   is a simple and efficient technique to get around statistical   interference by WIFI emitters.   This document presents an architecture for an IPv6 multilink subnet   that is composed of a high speed powered backbone and a number of   IEEE802.15.4e TSCH wireless networks attached and synchronized by   backbone routers.  Route Computation may be achieved in a centralized   fashion by a Path Computation Entity (PCE), in a distributed fashion   using the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), or   in a mixed mode.  The Backbone Routers perform proxy Ipv6 Neighbor   Discovery (ND) operations over the backbone on behalf of the wireless   device, so they can share a same IPv6 subnet and appear to be   connected to the same backbone as classical devices.2.  Terminology   The draft uses terminology defined in [I-D.palattella-6tsch-   terminology], [I-D.chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-efficient-nd], [RFC5191]   and [RFC4080].   It conforms to the terms and models described for IPv6 in [RFC5889]   and uses the vocabulary and the concepts defined in [RFC4291] for   IPv6.3.  Applications and GoalsThubert, Assimiti & WattExpires October 19, 2013                [Page 3]Internet-Draft             6tsch-architecture                 April 2013   The architecture derives from existing industrial standards for   Process Control by its focus on Deterministic Networking, in   particular with the use of the IEEE802.15.4e TSCH MAC and the   centralized path computation entity.  This approach leverages the   TSCH MAC benefits for high reliability against interferences, low-   power consumption on deterministic traffic, and its Traffic   Engineering capabilities.  Deterministic Networking applies in   particular to open and close control loops, as well as supervisory   control flows, and management.   Additional industrial use cases are addressed with the addition of a   more autonomic and distributed routing based on RPL. These use cases   include plant setup and decommissioning, as well as monitoring of   lots of lesser importance measurements such as corrosion and events.   RPL also enables mobile use cases such as mobile workers and cranes.   A Backbone Router is included in order to scale the factory plant   subnet to address large deployments, with proxy ND and time   synchronization over a high speed backbone.   The architecture also applies to building automation that leverage   RPL's storing mode to address multipath over a large number of hops,   in-vehicule command and control that can be as demanding as   industrial applications, commercial automation and asset tracking   with mobile scenarios, home automation and domotics which become more   reliable and thus provide a better user experience, and resource   management (energy, water, etc...).4.  Overview and Scope   The scope of the present work is a subnet that, in its basic   configuration, is made of a IEEE802.15.4e Time Slotted Channel   Hopping (TSCH) [I-D.watteyne-6tsch-tsch-lln-context] MAC Route-Over   Low Power Lossy Network (LLN).                  +-----+               |     | LLN Border               |     | router               +-----+             o    o   o      o     o   o     o         o   o LLN   o    o     o            o   o   o       o                    oThubert, Assimiti & WattExpires October 19, 2013                [Page 4]Internet-Draft             6tsch-architecture                 April 2013   The LLN devices communicate over IPv6 [RFC2460] using the 6LoWPAN   Header Compression (6LoWPAN HC) [RFC6282].  Neighbor Devices are   discovered with 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery (6LoWPAN ND) [RFC6775] and   the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)   [RFC6550] enables routing within the LLN. RPL forms Destination   Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs) within instances of the   protocol, each instance being associated with an Objective Function   (OF) to form a routing topology.  A particular LLN device, usually   powered, acts as RPL root, 6LoWPAN HC terminator, and LLN Border   Router (LBR) to the outside.   An extended configuration of the subnet comprises multiple LLNs.  The   LLNs are interconnected and synchronized over a backbone, that can be   wired or wireless.  The backbone can be a classical IPv6 network,   with Neighbor Discovery operating as defined in [RFC4861] and   [RFC4862].  The backbone can also support Efficiency aware IPv6   Neighbor Discovery Optimizations  [I-D.chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-   efficient-nd] in mixed mode as described in [I-D.thubert-6lowpan-   backbone-router].   Security is often handled at layer 2 and Layer 4. Authentication   during the join process is handled with the Protocol for Carrying   Authentication for Network Access (PANA) [RFC5191].   The LLN devices are time-synchronized at MAC level.  The MAC   coordinator that serves as time source through Enhanced Beacons (EB)   is loosely coupled with the RPL parent; this way, the time   synchronization starts at the RPL root and follows the RPL DODAGs   with no timing loop.   In the extended configuration, the functionality of the LBR is   enhanced to that of Backbone Router (BBR). A BBR is an LBR, but also   an Energy Aware Default Router (NEAR) as defined in [I-D.chakrabarti-   nordmark-6man-efficient-nd].  The BBR performs ND proxy operations   between the registered devices and the classical ND devices that are   located over the backbone.  6TSCH BBRs synchronize with one another   over the backbone, so as to ensure that the multiple LLNs that form   the IPv6 subnet stay tightly synchronized.  If the Backbone is   Deterministic (such as defined by the Time Sensitive Networking WG at   IEEE), then the Backbone Router ensures that the end-to-end   deterministic behavior is maintained between the LLN and the   backbone.Thubert, Assimiti & WattExpires October 19, 2013                [Page 5]Internet-Draft             6tsch-architecture                 April 2013               ---+------------------------                  |      External Network                  |               +-----+                  +-----+               |     | Router           |     | PCE               |     |                  |     |               +-----+                  +-----+                  |                        |                  |     Subnet Backbone    |            +--------------------+------------------+            |                    |                  |         +-----+             +-----+             +-----+         |     | Backbone    |     | Backbone    |     | Backbone    o    |     | router      |     | router      |     | router         +-----+             +-----+             +-----+    o                  o                   o                 o   o        o    o   o         o   o  o   o         o  o   o    o   o             o        o  LLN      o      o         o      o      o   o    o      o      o o     o  o   o    o    o     o   The main architectural blocks are arranged as follows:        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+-----+        |PCEP |   CoAP    |PANA |6LoWPAN| RPL |        | PCC |DTLS |     |     |   ND  |     |        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+-----+-----+        | TCP |       UDP       |    ICMP     |RSVP |        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+-----+-----+        |                 IPv6                      |        +-------------------------------------------+        |               6LoWPAN HC                  |        +-------------------------------------------+        |                   6TUS                    |        +-------------------------------------------+        |             802.15.4e   TSCH              |        +-------------------------------------------+   RPL is the routing protocol of choice for LLNs.

Centralized vs.  Distributed Routing6.  Functional Flows7.  Network Synchronization   The mechanism(s) used for time synchronization is something that we   might have to reconcile with RPL discovery and maintenance traffic.   Time synchronization in TSCH is based on three mechanisms:      Enhanced Beacons      Enhanced ACKs      Frame based synchronization   If a node communicates intermittently (sleepy, battery operated) it   can also proactively ping its time source and receive time stamps.   In order to maximize battery life and network throughput, it is   advisable that RPL ICMP discovery and maintenance traffic (governed   by the trickle timer) be somehow coordinated with the transmission of   time synch packets (especially with enhanced beacons). This could be   a function of the shim layer or it could be deferred to the device   management entity.  Any suggestions, ideas on this topic?8.  TSCH and 6TUS8.1.  6tus   6tus is an adaptation layer which is the next higher layer to TSCH   and which offers a set of commands defining a data and management   interface.  6tus is defined in [I-D.wang-6tsch-6tus]   The management interface of 6tus enables an upper layer to schedule   cells and slotframes in the TSCH schedule.   If the scheduling entity explicitly specifies the slotOffset/   channelOffset of the cells to be added/deleted, those cells are   marked as "hard".  6tus can not move hard cells in the TSCH schedule.   Hard cells are typically used by an central PCE.Thubert, Assimiti & WattExpires October 19, 2013                [Page 7]Internet-Draft             6tsch-architecture                 April 2013   6tus contains a monitoring process which monitors the performance of   cells, and can move a cell in the TSCH schedule when it performs bad.   This is only applicable to cells which are marked as "soft".  To   reserve a soft cell, the higher layer does not indicate the   slotOffset/channelOffset of the cell to add, but rather the resulting   bandwidth and QoS requirements.  When the monitoring process triggers   an cell reallocation, the two neighbor motes communication over this   cells negociate the new position in the TSCH schedule of this cell.8.2.  Slotframes and Priorities   6tus uses priority queues to manage concurrent data flows of   different prioroties.  When a packet is received from an higher layer   for transmission, the I-MUX module of 6tus inserts that packet in the   outgoing queue which matches the packet best (DSCP can therefore be   used). At each schedule transmit slot, the MUX module looks for the   frame in all the outgoing queues that best matches the cells.  If a   frame is found, it is given to TSCH for transmission.8.3.  Centralized Flow Reservation   In a centralized setting, a PCE computes the TSCH schedule, and   communicates with the different nodes in the network to configure   their TSCH schedule.  Since it has full knowledge of the network's   topology, the PCE can compute a collision-free schedule, which result   in a high degree of communication determinism.   The protocol for the PCE to communicate with the motes is not yet   defined.  This protocol typically reserves hard cells on the   transmitter side of a dedicated cell, and the negociation protocol of   6tus takes care of reserving the same cell on the receiver node.8.4.  Distributed Flow Reservation   In a distributed setting, no central PCE in present in the network.   Nodes use 6tus to reserve soft cells with their neighbors.  Since no   node has full knowledge of the network's topology and the traffic   requirements, scheduling collisions are possible, for example because   of a hidden terminal problem.   A schedule collision can be detected if two motes have multiple   dedicated cells schedule to one another.  The statistics process of   6tus can be configure to continuously compute the packet delivery   ratio of those cells, and the monitoring process of 6tus can declare   a soft cell to perform bad when that statistics for that cell is   significantly worse than for the other cell to the same neighbor.   When this happens, the monitoring process of 6tus moves the cell to   another location in the 6TSCH schedule, through a re-negociation   procedure with the neighbor.   The entity that builds and maintains the schedule in a distributed   fashion is not yet defined.Thubert, Assimiti & WattExpires October 19, 2013                [Page 8]Internet-Draft             6tsch-architecture                 April 20138.5.
