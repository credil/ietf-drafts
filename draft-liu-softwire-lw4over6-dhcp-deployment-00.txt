1.  Introduction

   Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is a mechanism which
   provides IPv4 access over IPv6 network for hub-and-spoke softwire
   architecture using IPv4-in-IPv6 tunneling mechanism.  In Lightweight
   4over6, Lightweight B4 (lwB4) is assigned a port-restricted IPv4
   address or a full IPv4 address by using dynamic IPv4 address
   provisioning protocol or static configuration.  Lightweight AFTR
   (lwAFTR) maintains per subscriber binding consisting of the lwB4's
   IPv6 address and its assigned IPv4 address and port set.  The binding
   table is synchronized with the IPv4 address provisioning process.

   DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] defines two new
   DHCPv6 messages for IPv4 configuration across IPv6 networks:
   BOOTREQUESTV6 and BOOTREPLYV6.  DHCPv4 messages are put into BOOTP
   Message Option using the two new DHCPv6 messages for transportation.

   This document discusses how to deploy Lightweight 4over6 using DHCPv4
   over DHCPv6 as the IPv4 address provisioning protocol.  It mainly
   focus on the deployment scenarios and binding table maintaining
   issues.

2.  Terminology

   Terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] and
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is used extensively in this document.

3.  Deployment Considerations

   When deploying Lightweight 4over6 with DHCPv4 over DHCPv6, DHCPv4
   over DHCPv6 client function is implemented on the lwB4. lwB4/DHCPv4
   -over-DHCPv6 client sends BOOTREQUESTV6 message to either the well-

   known multicast or directly to the 4o6 Server's IPv6 address in order
   to obtain IPv4 address.

   In this document, we assume lwAFTR maintains the binding table
   dynamically through DHCP process.  This means that lwAFTR is co-
   located with either a DHCP 4o6 Server, or a DHCPv6 relay agent which
   is on the link from the DHCP client to the 4o6 Server.

   When lwAFTR is the next-hop of lwB4, it's meaningless to set up IPv4
   -in-IPv6 tunnel between lwB4 and lwAFTR, so we ignore this case in
   this document.

3.1.  lwB4 Consideration

   When lwB4/DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 client uses multicast to send
   BOOTREQUESTV6 message, the service provider deploys a DHCPv6 relay
   agent which is an one-hop neighbour of lwB4 to relay DHCPv6 messages.
   If the DHCP 4o6 Server is not used as lwB4's DHCPv6 server, the relay
   agent should be updated to support the separation of 4o6 Server and
   DHCPv6 only server as described in section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6].

   When lwB4/DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 client sends BOOTREQUESTV6 message using
   unicast, it needs to obtain the IPv6 address of the DHCP 4o6 Server
   before the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 process.  This address is conveyed by
   OPTION_4O6_SERVERS defined in [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6].

   DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 does not prohibit a client without any global IPv6
   address to obtain IPv4 address by using multicast.  However, the
   binding table in AFTR can not be updated if the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6
   packet does not contain lwB4's global IPv6 address, so lwB4 must
   obtain global IPv6 address before it starts DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6
   process.  Section 5 of this document discusses how to carry lwB4's
   global IPv6 address in BOOTREQUESTV6 message.

3.2.  lwAFTR Consideration

   No matter whether the lwAFTR works as a DHCPv6 relay or a DHCP 4o6
   Server, it has to extract the DHCPv4 message from the BOOTP Message
   Option. lwAFTR uses the information and the global IPv6 address to
   update the binding table.  Section 5 of this document discusses how
   to get the global IPv6 address of lwB4.

4.  Deployment Models

   There are 3 possible models of the deployment of lwAFTR:

      Model 1: lwAFTR is co-located with DHCP 4o6 Server as well as the

      DHCPv4 server engine of the 4o6 Server

      Model 2: lwAFTR is co-located with DHCPv6 relay agent

      Model 3: lwAFTR is co-located with DHCP 4o6 Server's v6 part, and
      the DHCPv4 server engine is a separate device

   When a service provider deploys multiple lwAFTRs, he may have the
   requirement of sharing one DHCP 4o6 server among multiple lwAFTRs.
   Model 2 and Model 3 supports this usage.

4.1.  Model 1

   In Model 1, lwAFTR is co-located with a complete DHCP 4o6 Server.
   Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of this model.

   The lwB4, as a DHCP client, can send the BOOTREQUESTV6 message using
   multicast as is described in [RFC3315].  The packets may be relayed
   toward the lwAFTR/4o6 Server.

   When lwB4 uses unicast to send BOOTREQUESTV6 message, it employs the
   IPv6 address conveyed through the 4o6 Servers Address Option
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6].  The IPv6 address is that of the
   lwAFTR/4o6 Server.

                             Figure 1: Model 1

4.2.  Model 2

   In Model 2, lwAFTR is co-located with a DHCPv6 relay agent.  It is
   configured with the 4o6 Server's IPv6 address as the destination
   address.  Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of this model.

   When lwB4 uses multicast to send BOOTREQUESTV6 message, the one-hop
   neighbour relay agent is configured with the IPv6 address of the

   lwAFTR/relay agent and relays DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 packages to lwAFTR/
   relay agent.

   When lwB4 uses unicast to send BOOTREQUESTV6 message, the destination
   address it obtains is the lwAFTR's/relay agent's IPv6 address.

   //We are not sure whether a DHCPv6 client should send messages
   directly to a relay agent or not.

                             Figure 2: Model 2

4.3.  Model 3

   In Model 3, lwAFTR is co-located with a DHCP 4o6 Server, but the
   DHCPv4 server engine of the 4o6 Server is a separate device.  Figure
   3 illustrates the architecture of this model.  The behavior of lwB4
   and one-hop neighbour relay agent is the same as that in Model 1.

   Section 8 of [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] describes that the
   DHCPv4 server engine can be a separate DHCPv4 server instance, but
   does not provide how to implement that and how does a 4o6 Server
   communicate with the engine.  In this model we suggest the DHCPv4
   server engine to be a regular standalone DHCPv4 server.

                             Figure 3: Model 3

5.  Carrying lwB4's IPv6 address

   The lwB4 is expected to send the BOOTREQUESTV6 message using the
   lwB4's global IPv6 address, so that lwAFTR can update the binding
   table with this information.  When lwB4 sends BOOTREQUESTV6 message
   by unicast, the source address of the packet can be used as the
   client's global IPv6 address.  However, this can not be achieved when
   lwB4 sends BOOTREQUESTV6 message by multicast because Section 16 of
   [RFC3315] defines that the DHCP client must use a link-local address
   when using multicast.

   There are two possible solutions for this problem: (1) force lwB4/
   DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 client not to use multicast, or (2) Put a DHCPv6
   option which contains the global IPv6 address of lwB4 into the
   BOOTREQUESTV6 message.

   We recommend solution (2) as the address carrying method to fit more
   deployment scenarios.  The DHCPv6 option to be used may be an
   existing option or a new defined option.
