    Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds (6to4) as Last Resort
                  draft-troan-v6ops-6to4-update-00.txt

Abstract

   Experience with the mechanism described in "An Anycast Prefix for
   6to4 Relay Routers" [RFC3068] has shown that the mechanism is not a
   reliable means for communicating with resources in the public IPv6
   Internet.  This limits the applicability of the "6to4" mechanism
   described in [RFC3056].

1.  Introduction

   Experience with the mechanism described in [RFC3068] has shown that
   the mechanism is not a reliable means for permitting hosts using 6to4
   addresses (2002::/16) to communicate with resources in the public
   IPv6 Internet.

   The particular problems are described in section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-6to4-advisory].

   This limits the applicability of the "6to4" mechanism described in
   [RFC3056].  Without a reliable mechanism of communication between the
   6to4 realm and the native IPv6 realm, 6to4 should be considered
   primarily as a mechanism to communicate between hosts that are both
   using 6to4 addresses.  Use of 6to4 addresses in general and [RFC3068]
   in particular should be considered a "last resort" means of
   communicating with resources in the public IPv6 Internet.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  6to4 as a mechanism of last resort

   While usage of 6to4 will decrease as native IPv6 is deployed, this
   will take time.  In order to ensure that hosts supporting both 6to4
   and IPv4 prefer more reliable connectivity mechanisms where
   available, this document recommends making 6to4 a service of last
   resort.

   Implementations capable of acting as 6to4 routers MUST NOT enable
   6to4 without explicit user configuration.  In particular, enabling
   IPv6 forwarding on a device, MUST NOT automatically enable 6to4.

   When performing address selection, connections between an IPv4 source
   and destination address SHOULD be preferred to connections either
   between a 6to4 source address and a native v6 destination address, or
   between a native v6 source address and a 6to4 destination address.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no recommendation to IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   There are no new security considerations pertaining to this document.
   General security issues with tunnels are listed in
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-tunnel-security-concerns] and more specifically to
   6to4 in [RFC3964] and [I-D.ietf-v6ops-tunnel-loops].
