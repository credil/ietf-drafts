Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP), Compressed Bundle Header Encoding
              (CBHE), and Bundle Protocol IANA Registries

Abstract

   The DTNRG research group has defined the experimental Licklider
   Transmission Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326] and the Compressed Bundle
   Header Encoding (CBHE) [RFC6260] mechanism for the 'ipn' URI scheme.
   Finally, RFC5050 [RFC5050] defines values for the Bundle
   Administrative Record Type.  All of these describe fields that are
   subject to a registry.  For the purpose of its research work, the
   group has created ad-hoc registries.  As the specifications are
   stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group
   would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official custody.
   This document describes the actions needed to be executed by IANA.

Internet-Draft     LTP, CBHE, and BP  IANA Registries      February 2012


1.  Introduction

   The DTNRG research group has defined the Licklider Transmission
   Protocol (LTP)[RFC5326].  LTP contains certain fields that are
   subject to a registry.  For the purpose of its research work, the
   group has created ad-hoc registries.  As the specifications are
   stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group
   would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official custody.
   This document describes the actions needed to be executed by IANA
   [RFC5226].

   The Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) [RFC6260] specification
   defines the concepts of Node Number and Service Number in the 'ipn'
   URI scheme.  In this document we request formation of an IANA
   registry for the Node Number field in the 'ipn' scheme.  There is a
   separate Internet Draft that will (if approved) establish a registry
   for the service-nbr portion and relate entries there to a
   corresponding registry for the 'dtn' URI scheme.

   Because of its association with space communication and the
   Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems [CCSDS], a portion of
   the CBHE Node Number space and a portion of the LTP Engine ID space
   is delegated by this document to the CCSDS Space Assigned Numbers
   Authority [SANA].  SANA functions similarly to IANA in that it
   maintains registries of managed values, with a focus on values used
   by protocols used by CCSDS member agencies.


2.  Licklider Transmission Protocol

   The Licklider Transmission Protocol has fields requiring registries
   managed by IANA.  This document requests the creation of the three
   registries in this section and that they be associated with the other
   registries for the Licklider Transmission protocol.

2.1.  LTP Cancel Segment Reason Codes

   Section 3.2.4 of [RFC5326] defines the reason codes that may be
   present in Cancel Segments in the LTP protocol.

   The registration policy for this registry is:

   0x00--0x05  As defined by RFC5326 and shown in in Table 2-1 below.

   0x06 -- 0xFF  Allocatable by IANA; RFC Required

   The initial values for the LTP Cancel Segment Reason Codes registry
   shall be:

2.2.  LTP Engine ID

   The Licklider Transmission Protocol has an LTP Engine ID field
   (section 2 of [RFC5326]).  An IANA registry shall be set up as
   follows.

   The registration policy for this registry is:

   0  Reserved; no allocation by IANA

   1 -- (2**14)-1  Allocatable by IANA; expert review required.  The
      designated experts for the review are the chairs of the IRTF DTN
      Research Group (dtnrg) if the dtnrg is extant, or as determined by
      the IRSG.

   (2**14) -- (2**21)-1  Allocated to the Space Assigned Numbers
      Authority (SANA) for use by Consultative Committee for Space Data
      Systems (CCSDS) missions.

   (2**21) -- (2**27)-1  Private or experimental use.  No assignment by
      IANA.

   (2**27) -- (2**42)-1  Allocatable by IANA on a First-come, First-
      Served basis for requests for less than or equal to 2**14 values.
      Expert review for requests of more than 2**14 values.  The
      designated experts for the review are the chairs of the IRTF DTN
      Research Group (dtnrg) if the dtnrg is extant, or as determined by
      the IRSG.

   >= (2**42)  Reserved

   The LTP Engine ID is expressed as a Self-Delimiting Numeric Value
   (SDNV) in the LTP protocol and no maximum is specified in the
   protocol definition.  SDNVs were first described in relation to the

     +--------------------+----------------------------+---------------+

2.3.  LTP Client Service ID

   The Licklider Transmission Protocol has a client service ID number
   field (section 3.2.1 of [RFC5326]).  An IANA registry shall be set up
   as follows.

   The registration policy for this registry is:

   0 -- 3  Initial registry values as shown in table 2-3 below.

   4 -- (2**14)-1  Administered by CCSDS SANA

   2**14 -- 32,767  Private or experimental use; no assignment by IANA.

   >= 32,768  Allocatable by IANA.  Expert review required.  The
      designated experts for the review are the chairs of the IRTF DTN
      Research Group (dtnrg) if the dtnrg is extant, or as determined by
      the IRSG.

   The LTP Client Service ID is expressed as a Self-Delimiting Numeric
   Value (SDNV) in the LTP protocol and no maximum value is specified in

3.  Compressed Bundle Header Encoding

   The Compressed Bundle Header Encoding specification defines concepts
   of 'Node Number' and 'Service Number' that require registries managed
   by IANA.  This document addresses the 'Node Number' registry; a
   separate document addresses the formation and management of the
   'Service Number' registry.

3.1.  CBHE Node Numbers

   The Compressed Bundle Header Enoding specification defnes a Node
   Number (node-nbr) field (section 2.1 of [RFC6260]).  An IANA registry
   shall be set up as follows.

   The registration policy for this registry is:

   0  Reserved

   1 -- (2**14)-1  Expert review required.  The designated experts for
      the review are the chairs of the IRTF DTN Research Group (dtnrg)
      if the dtnrg is extant, or as determined by the IRSG.

   (2**14) -- (2**21)-1  Allocated to the Space Assigned Numbers
      Authority (SANA) for use by Consultative Committee for Space Data
      Systems (CCSDS) missions.

      Served basis for requests for less than or equal to 2**14 values.
      Expert review for requests of more than 2**14 values.  The
      designated experts for the review are the chairs of the IRTF DTN
      Research Group (dtnrg) if the dtnrg is extant, or as determined by

   The CBHE Node Number is expressed as a Self-Delimiting Numeric Value
   (SDNV) in the CBHE specification.  Allowable values for the Node
   Number range from 1 -- 2**64)-1.  The initial values for the CBHE
   Node Number registry shall be:

     +--------------------+----------------------------+---------------+

3.2.  CBHE Service Numbers

   The Compressed Bundle Header Enoding specification defnes a Service
   Number (service-nbr) field (section 2.1 of [RFC6260]).  An IANA
   registry shall be set up as follows.

   The registration policy for this registry is:

   0 -- 4  Initial values defined in table 3-1 below.

   5 -- 127  Administered by CCSDS SANA

   128 -- 2**16-1  Allocatable by IANA -- document required.

   >= 2**16  Private / Experimental Use

   The CBHE Service Number is expressed as a Self-Delimiting Numeric
   Value (SDNV) in the CBHE specification.  Allowable values for the
   Node Number range from 1 -- 2**64)-1.  The initial values for the
   CBHE Node Number registry shall be:

4.  Bundle Administrative Record Types

   Section 6.1 of the Bundle Protocol specification[RFC5050] specifies a
   4-bit Administrative Record type code.  An IANA registry shall be set
   up as follows to manage these record types.  This document requests
   the addition of an additional registry titled 'Bundle Administrative
   Record Type' be added to the list of registries associated with the
   Bundle Protcol.

   The registration policy for this registry is:

   0  Reserved

   1--2  Defined by RFC5050 as shown in table 4-1 below.

   3-15  RFC required

   The initial values for the Bundle Administrative Record Type registry
   shall be:
