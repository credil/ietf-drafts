                           ISATAP Tunnel MTU
                      draft-bar-v6ops-ismtu-00.txt

Abstract

   The ISATAP tunnel MTU is currently recommended to be set to 1480 or
   less.  This is to avoid IPv4 fragmentation within the tunnel, but
   requires the ISATAP tunnel ingress interface to drop any IPv6 packet
   larger than 1480 bytes and return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB)
   message.  Concerns for operational issues with both IPv4 and IPv6
   Path MTU Discovery point to the possibility of MTU-related black
   holes when a packet is dropped due to an MTU restriction, so dropping
   packets is considered highly undesirable.  Fortunately, the "Internet
   cell size" is 1500 bytes, i.e., the minimum MTU configured by the
   vast majority of links in the Internet.  This document therefore
   presents a method to boost the ISATAP MTU to 1500 bytes.

1.  Introduction

   The ISATAP tunnel MTU is currently recommended to be set to 1480
   [RFC5214].  This is to avoid IPv4 fragmentation within the tunnel
   [RFC0791], but requires the ISATAP tunnel ingress interface to drop
   any IPv6 packet larger than 1480 bytes and return an ICMPv6 Packet
   Too Big (PTB) message [RFC2460].  Concerns for operational issues
   with both IPv4 and IPv6 Path MTU Discovery [RFC1191][RFC1981] point
   to the possibility of MTU-related black holes when a packet is
   dropped due to an MTU restriction, so dropping packets is considered
   highly undesirable.  Fortunately, the "Internet cell size" is 1500
   bytes, i.e., the minimum MTU configured by the vast majority of links
   in the Internet, such that 1500 byte or smaller packets are likely to
   be delivered without loss to MTU limitations in the vast majority of
   cases.  This document therefore presents a method to boost the ISATAP
   tunnel MTU to 1500 bytes.

   Pushing the ISATAP tunnel MTU to 1500 bytes is met with the challenge
   that the addition of the IPv4 encapsulation header would cause a 1500
   byte IPv6 packet to appear as a 1520 byte IPv4 packet on the wire.
   This can result in the packet being either fragmented or dropped by
   an IPv4 router that configures a 1500 byte link, depending on the
   setting of the "Don't Fragment" (DF) bit in the IPv4 header.  Using
   the approach outlined in this document, the ISATAP tunnel avoids this
   issue by performing IPv6 fragmentation on the inner IPv6 packet
   before IPv4 encapsulation.  The approach is outlined in the following
   sections.


2.  Setting the ISATAP MTU to 1500 Bytes

   Setting the ISATAP MTU to 1500 bytes is accomplished via the
   following algorithm:

      1. set the ISATAP tunnel interface MTU to 1500
      2. for IPv6 packets to be admitted into the ISATAP tunnel,
         do the following:

         a) drop the packet and send an ICMPv6 PTB if it is
            1501 or more
         b) encapsulate the packet in an IPv4 header and send
            it to the tunnel far end if it is 1280 or less
         c) if the packet is between 1281 - 1500:
            - break it into 2 equal-sized pieces and insert a
              fragment header on both pieces
            - choose a random 32-bit value and write the value
              in the Identification field in both pieces
            - encapsulate both pieces in an IPv4 header and
              send them to the tunnel far end
     3. the IPv6 destination host gets to reassemble if
            necessary



3.  Discussion

   In the algorithm given in Section 2, the ISATAP tunnel interface MTU
   for ISATAP hosts and/or routers can be set to 1500 bytes
   independently of other ISATAP interfaces within the site, i.e., the
   approach is incrementally deployable.

   The algorithm in Section 2 further ignores the IPv6 requirement that
   routers in the network must not fragment IPv6 packets, i.e.
   fragmentation must be performed only by hosts.  However, we observe
   that the ISATAP host is allowed to perform IPv6 fragmentation.  We
   further observe that the ISATAP router is tied through stateless
   address mapping to a single ISATAP host such that the fragments would
   not be delivered to multiple hosts.

   The algorithm in Section 2 requires that ISATAP ingress tunnel
   endpoint perform IPv6 fragmentation (when necessary), but the ISATAP
   egress tunnel endpoint does not perform reassembly; hence, the ISATAP
   tunnel endpoints remain stateless.  Instead, the final destination
   IPv6 host may be obliged to reassemble IPv6 packets up to 1500 bytes
   in length, but hosts are required to reassemble at least that much by
   the IPv6 standard [RFC2460].

   Since the ISATAP tunnel endpoints set the Identification field in
   fragmented IPv6 packets to a random 32-but value, there is no
   possibility for "serialization" in which an IPv6 host might find the
   number of distinct outstanding Identification values reduced due to
   the ISATAP tunnel endpoint applying a single serial Identification

   value for all IPv6 hosts.  And, the use of a random 32-bit value
   would still allow for far more than enough outstanding IPv6 packet
   reassemblies without risk of colliding Identification values.


4.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations for this document.


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for ISATAP apply also to this document.
