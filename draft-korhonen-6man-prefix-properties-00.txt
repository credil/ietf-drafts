Internet-Draft           IPv6 Prefix Properties            February 2013


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines an extension to the IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery protocol and its Prefix Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861].
   The Prefix Information Option is extended with flag bits that
   describe, for example, the mobility management properties associated
   to the prefix, and a class value that conveys metadata associated to
   the prefix with local administrative domain wide importance.
   Furthermore, the specification discusses corresponding source address
   selection hint flags to the IPv6 Socket API for Source Address
   Selection [RFC5014].

   For example, the IPv6 Socket API for Source Address Selection [RFC5014]
   already covers Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275] and allows selecting between a
   home address (HoA) and a care-of address (CoA).  A mobile node (MN)
   with a client based mobility IP stack is supposed to know which
   prefixes are CoA(s) and/or HoA(s).  However, this is not the case with
   network based mobility management where the MN is expected to be
   agnostic of the mobility support. Outside the mobility protocols,
   there are other potential use cases where associating properties to
   the advertised prefixes could be useful as discussed in 
   [I-D.bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix].

   The extensions to [RFC4861] are minimal in a sense that they do not
   define new functionality to, for example, any existing mobility
   protocol but instead add an explicit indication of network based
   mobility knowledge into the IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration
   (SLAAC).

   This would allow for network based mobility solutions, such as Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] or GTP [TS.29274] to explicitly indicate that
   their prefixes have mobility, and therefore, the MN IP stack can make
   an educated selection between prefixes that have mobility and those
   that do not.  There is also a potential need to extend both [RFC3493]
   and [RFC5014] in order to provide required hooks into socket APIs.

   The underlying assumption is that a MN has multiple prefixes to
   choose from.  Typically this means either the MN has multiple
   interfaces or an interface has been configured with multiple
   prefixes.  This specification does not make a distinction between
   these alternatives and does not either make any assumptions how the
   possible transfer of a prefix is done between interfaces in the case
   a network based mobility solution is used.


2.  Background and Motivation

   This section discusses the motivations behind adding metadata and
   other address selection decision making affecting information into
   IPv6 prefixes.  The additional information is convey from the network
   to a end host during the IPv6 address configuration phase.  The

   motivation example taken from and discussed below is from the mobile
   networks.

   IP mobility and its centralized topological anchoring of IP addresses
   has known issues.  For instance, non-optimal routing is a classical
   example.  Another concerns include excessive tunneling, increased
   signaling due the maintenance of mobility related bindings,
   aggregation of traffic to centralized mobility anchor gateways and
   unnecessary IP mobility related state management for IP traffic that
   does not as such benefit from mobility.  In general, it is observed
   that most applications do not need IP level mobility, and work just
   fine with "temporary" IP addresses that come and go.  However, IP
   mobility still has its virtues making the applications unaware of
   mobility, and certain wireless mobile networking architecture make
   extensive use of network based IP mobility.

   In order to overcome some of the above issues, use of local resources
   and topologically local addressing could be enhanced.  In many cases
   this would lead to use of multiple addresses of which some provide
   mobility and some do not.  However, an end host has to have means to
   distinguish between addresses that provide mobility, and those that
   are short lived and usable only within a limited topological area.
   This specification provides extensions to IPv6 address management and
   source address selection so that end hosts (and their applications)
   can select a proper address for their needs.

   This specification also shares similar motivations for classifying
   the prefix properties outside mobility protocols as described in
   [I-D.bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix].  This specification
   complements [I-D.bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix] by providing the
   SLAAC version of the additional prefix related information delivery
   compared to the DHCPv6 stateful approach.


3.  Option Formats

   Neighbor Discovery messages include zero or more options, some of
   which may appear multiple times in the same message.  Options should
   be padded when necessary to ensure that they end on their natural 64-
   bit boundaries.  Figure 1 illustrates a Prefix Information Option
   [RFC4861] that is extended with the Class value and the Properties
   flag bits:

               Figure 1: Extended Prefix Information Option

   Properties  16 bits vector of flags for prefix properties.  The
       prefix property adds complementary information to e.g., mobility,
       Internet reachability and security properties.  The possible
       values are described in Section 6.1 of
       [I-D.bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix].  The value '0' is reserved
       and states nothing about the prefix.  Unknown Properties are
       treated as value '0'.

   Class  16 bits of metadata associated with the prefix.  The Class has
       only local relevance within an administrative domain.  There are
       no centralized registry available for the Class values.  The
       value '0' is reserved and states nothing about the prefix.
       Unknown Class is treated as value '0'.


4.  Host Considerations

4.1.  Internal Data Structures

   The host internal data structures need to be extended with the
   'prefix Property' and the 'prefix Class' information associated to
   the learned prefix and configured addresses.  How this is
   accomplished is host implementation specific.  It is also a host
   implementation issue how an application can learn or query both
   Properties or Class of an address or a prefix.  One possibility is to
   provide such information through the socket API extensions (see



Korhonen, et al.         Expires August 20, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Prefix Properties            February 2013


   discussion in [I-D.liu-dmm-mobility-api]).  Other possibilities
   include the use of e.g., ioctl() or NetLink [RFC3549] extensions.

4.2.  Default Address Selection

   The 'prefix Property' and the 'prefix Class' information is only used
   as a hint.  They do not affect the existing [RFC6724] automatically.
   A specific rule to host's policy table has to be inserted by an
   application or some daemon process.  Alternatively, an application
   can express its address mobility property preferences through the
   socket API extensions (see discussion in [I-D.liu-dmm-mobility-api]),
   which means the socket library or middleware has to modify [RFC6724]
   policy table or algorithm.

   The IP stack MAY use the 'prefix Properties' flags and 'prefix Class'
   information to supersede [RFC6724] Source Address Selection Rule 8
   when selecting a default source address among multiple choices and an
   application has not explicitly indicate what kind of source address
   it prefers.


5.  Security Considerations

   Existing Prefix Information Option related security considerations
   apply as described in [RFC4861] and [RFC4191].  A malicious node on
   the shared link could include such 'mobility property' flags in a
   Prefix Information Option causing the host to learn wrong information
   regarding the prefix and thus make misguided selection of prefixes on
   the link.  Similarly a malicious middleman on the link could modify
   'mobility property' flags in a Prefix Information Option causing
   misguided selection of prefixes.  In order to avoid on-link attacks,
   SeND [RFC3971] can be used to reject Router Advertisements from
   potentially malicious nodes and guarantee integrity protection of the
   Router Advertisements.


6.  IANA Considerations

   Section 3 defines two new fields into the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   protocol's Prefix Information Option [RFC4861].  The prefix Class
   field has only local administrative domain relevance and causes no
   IANA actions.  The prefix Properties bit vector flags field reuses
   the existing DHCPv6 OPTION_PREFIX_PROPERTY values registry
   established by [I-D.bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix].
