      <t>This memo defines a new DHCPv6 option for indicating to a dual-stack
        host or router that IPv4 is to be turned off.</t>
    </abstract>

  </front>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>When a dual-stack host makes a DHCPv4 request, it typically interprets
        the absence of a response as a failure condition. This makes it
        difficult to deploy such nodes in an IPv6-only network.</t>

      <t>Take for example a home router that is dual-stack capable but
        provisioned with an IPv6-only WAN connection. When the router boots, it
        typically assigns an IPv4 address to its LAN interface, starts services
        on that interface, and starts handing out IPv4 addresses to clients on
        the LAN by answering DHCPv4 requests. This is done unconditionally,
        without taking the status of the IPv4 connectivity on the WAN interface
        into account. Hosts on the LAN, in turn, install a default route
        pointing to the router and start behaving as if IPv4 connectivity was
        available.  IPv4 packets destined to the Internet get dropped at the
        router and timeouts happen. The end result is that IPv4 remains fully
        active on the LAN and on the router itself even when it is desired that
        it be turned off.</t>

      <t>A new mechanism is needed to indicate the absence of IPv4 connectivity.
        Given that the goal is turning off IPv4, this new signaling mechanism
        shall be transported over IPv6. Therefore, we introduce a new DHCPv6
        <xref target="RFC3315"/> option for the purpose of explicitly indicating
        to the DHCPv6 client that IPv4 connectivity is unavailable.</t>

    <section title="The No-IPv4 Option">

      <section title="Wire Format">

        <t>The No-IPv4 DHCPv6 option is used to signal the unavailability of
          IPv4 connectivity. The format of the No-IPv4 option is:</t>

        <figure>

  option-len      1.

  v4-level        Level of IPv4 functionality.
          </artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>The DHCPv6 client MUST place the OPTION_NO_IPV4 option code in the
          Option Request Option (<xref target="RFC3315"/> section 22.7). Servers
          MAY include the option in responses (if they have been so
          configured). Servers MAY also place the OPTION_NO_IPV4 option code in
          an Option Request Option contained in a Reconfigure message.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Semantics">

        <t>The option applies to the link on which it is received by the DHCPv6
          client. It is used to indicate to the client that it should disable
          some or all of its IPv4 functionality. What should be disabled depends
          on the value of v4-level.</t>

        <t>v4-level can take the following values:

          <list style="hanging">

            <t hangText="0 - IPv4 fully enabled:">This is equivalent to the
              absence of the No-IPv4 option. It is included here so that a
              DHCPv6 server can explicitly re-enable IPv4 access by including it
              in a Reply message following a Reconfigure.</t>

            <t hangText="1 - No IPv4 upstream, local IPv4 permitted:">Any kind
              of IPv4 connectivity is unavailable on the link on which the
              option is received. Therefore, any attempts to provision IPv4 by
              the host or to use IPv4 in any fashion, on that link, will be
              useless. IPv4 MAY be dropped, blocked, or otherwise ignored on
              that link.</t>

            <t>Upon reception of the No-IPv4 option with value 1, the following
              IPv4 functionality MUST be disabled on the Upstream Interface:
              <list style="letters">
                <t>IPv4 addresses MUST NOT be assigned.</t>
                <t>Currently-assigned IPv4 addresses MUST be unassigned.</t>
                <t>Dynamic configuration of link-local IPv4 addresses <xref
                    target="RFC3927"/> MUST be disabled.</t>
                <t>IPv4, ICMPv4, or ARP packets MUST NOT be sent.</t>
                <t>IPv4, ICMPv4, or ARP packets received MUST be ignored.</t>
                <t>DNS A queries MUST NOT be sent, even transported over
                  IPv6.</t>
                </list>
            </t>

            <t>If all DHCPv6-configured interfaces receive the No-IPv4 option
              with value 1 or 2, and no other interface provides IPv4
              connectivity to the Internet, IPv4 is partially shut down, leaving
              only local connectivity active. On the Upstream Interface, IPv4
              MUST be shut down as listed above. On other interfaces, IPv4
              addresses MUST NOT be assigned except for the following:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>Loopback (127.0.0.0/8)</t>
                <t>Link Local (169.254.0.0/16) <xref target="RFC3927"/></t>
                <t>Private-Use (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16)
                  <xref target="RFC1918"/></t>
              </list>
            </t>

            <t hangText="2 - No IPv4 at all:">This is intended to be a stricter
              version of the above.</t>

            <t>The host or router running the DHCPv6 client that receives this
              option MUST disable IPv4 functionality on the Upstream Interface
              in the same way as for value 1.</t>

            <t>If all DHCPv6-configured interfaces received the No-IPv4 option
              with exclusively value 2, and no other interface provides IPv4
              connectivity to the Internet, IPv4 is completely shut down. In
              particular:
              <list style="letters">
                <t>IPv4 address MUST NOT be assigned to any interface.</t>
                <t>Currently-assigned IPv4 addresses MUST be unassigned.</t>
                <t>Dynamic configuration of link-local IPv4 addresses <xref
                    target="RFC3927"/> MUST be disabled.</t>
                <t>IPv4, ICMPv4, or ARP packets MUST NOT be sent on any
                  interface.</t>
                <t>IPv4, ICMPv4, or ARP packets received on any interface MUST be
                  ignored.</t>
                <t>In the above, "any interface" includes loopback interfaces. In
                  particular, the 127.0.0.1 special address MUST be removed.</t>
                <t>Server programs listening on IPv4 addresses (e.g., a DHCPv4
                  server) MAY be shut down.</t>
                <t>DNS A queries MUST NOT be sent, even transported over
                  IPv6.</t>
                <t>If the host or router also runs a DHCPv6 server, it SHOULD
                  include the No-IPv4 option with value 2 in DHCPv6 responses it
                  sends to clients that request it, unless prohibited by local
                  policy. If it currently has active clients, it SHOULD send a
                  Reconfigure to each of them with the OPTION_NO_IPV4 included
                  in the Option Request Option.</t>
              </list>
            </t>

            <t>The intent is to remove all traces of IPv4 activity. Once the
              No-IPv4 option with value 2 is activated, the network stack should
              behave as if IPv4 functionality had never been present. For
              example, a modular kernel implementation could accomplish the
              above by unloading the IPv4 kernel module at run time.</t>

          </list>

        </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Example">

        <t>A dual-stack home gateway is set up with a single WAN uplink and
          is configured to use DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 to automatically obtain IPv4
          and IPv6 connectivity. On the LAN side, it has one link with multiple
          hosts.</t>

        <t>When it boots, the router assigns 192.168.1.1/24 to its LAN
          interfaces and starts a DHCPv4 server listening on it. It hands out
          addresses 191.168.1.100-199 to clients. It also starts an IPv6 Router
          Advertisement daemon as well as a stateless DHCPv6 server, also
          listening on the LAN interfaces.</t>

        <t>On the WAN side, it starts two provisioning procedures in parallel:
          one for IPv4 and one for IPv6.</t>

        <t>At this point, the ISP does not know if the router supports IPv6-only
          operation.  Therefore, by default, the ISP responds to DHCPv4 requests
          as usual.</t>
       
        <t>As part of the IPv6 provisioning procedure, the router sends a DHCPv6
          request containing OPTION_NO_IPV4 in an Option Request Option. The
          ISP's DHCPv6 server's reply includes the No-IPv4 option with value 2.
          When this procedure finishes, the ISP has determined that this
          customer will run in IPv6-only mode and starts dropping all IPv4
          packets at the first hop. If an IPv4 address was assigned, it is
          reclaimed, and possibly reassigned to another subscriber.</t>

        <t>The home router aborts the IPv4 provisioning procedure (if it is
          still running) and deactivates all IPv4 functionality. It shuts down
          its DHCPv4 server. It also configures its own stateless DHCPv6 server
          to send the No-IPv4 option to clients that request it.</t>

        <t>As an optimization, the router could delay setting up IPv4 by a few
          seconds (10 seconds seems reasonable). If the IPv6 procedure completes
          with the No-IPv4 option during that time, IPv4 will never have been
          set up and the router will operate in pure IPv6-only mode from the
          start.</t>

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>A legacy IPv4-only device connected to a network running in mode 2
            (no IPv4 at all) will presumably keep retrying forever, e.g. sending
            DHCPDISCOVER messages endlessly. Do we want a way to signal to that
            host that IPv4 will never be available? But since that device was
            not updated for IPv6, it is doubtful that it would be updated to
            understand this new signaling. Could we reuse/overload some existing
            signaling that would have the same effect?</t>

      <t>One security concern is that an attacker could use the No-IPv4 option
        to deny IPv4 access to a victim. However, unprotected vanilla DHCP can

              In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
              the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
              capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
              interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
              should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

              <list>
                <t>
                  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
                  NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
                  "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
                  RFC 2119.
            </t></list></t>
            <t>
              Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
              level of the document in which they are used.

          <abstract>
            <t>To participate in wide-area IP networking, a host needs to be configured with IP addresses for its interfaces, either manually by the user or automatically from a source on the network such as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Unfortunately, such address configuration information may not always be available. It is therefore beneficial for a host to be able to depend on a useful subset of IP networking functions even when no address configuration is available. This document describes how a host may automatically configure an interface with an IPv4 address within the 169.254/16 prefix that is valid for communication with other devices connected to the same physical (or logical) link.&lt;/t>&lt;t> IPv4 Link-Local addresses are not suitable for communication with devices not directly connected to the same physical (or logical) link, and are only used where stable, routable addresses are not available (such as on ad hoc or isolated networks). This document does not recommend that IPv4 Link-Local addresses and routable addresses be configured simultaneously on the same interface. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

              The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework
              for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCPIP network.
              DHCP is based on the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) , adding the
              capability of automatic allocation of reusable network addresses and
              additional configuration options .  DHCP captures the behavior of
              BOOTP relay agents [7, 21], and DHCP participants can interoperate
              with BOOTP participants .
