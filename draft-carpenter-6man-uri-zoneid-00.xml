<t>This document describes how the Zone Identifier of an IPv6 scoped address can be represented in a Uniform Resource Identifier 
that includes a literal IPv6 address. It updates RFC 3986 and RFC 4007.
</t>
    
</abstract>
</front>

<middle>
<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t><xref target="RFC3986"/> defined how a literal IPv6 address can be represented in the "host" 
part of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). Subsequently, <xref target="RFC4007"/> extended
the text representation of limited-scope IPv6 addresses such that a zone identifier may be concatenated
to an address, for purposes described in that RFC. Zone identifiers are especially
useful in contexts where literal addresses are typically used, for example during fault diagnosis,
when it may be essential to specify which interface is used for sending to a link local address. 
It should be noted that zone identifiers have purely local meaning within the host where
they are defined, and they are completely meaningless for any other host. </t>

<t>RFC 4007 does not specify how zone identifiers are to be represented
in URIs. Practical experience has shown that this feature is useful, in particular when using a
web browser for debugging with link local addresses, but as it is undefined,
it is not implemented consistently in URI parsers or in browsers. </t>

<t>This document updates <xref target="RFC3986"/> by adding syntax to allow a zone identifier
to be included in a literal IPv6 address. It also clarifies some statements in <xref target="RFC4007"/>. </t>



<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>


</section> <!-- intro -->

<section anchor="spec" title="Specification">
<t>According to RFC 4007, a zone identifier is attached to the textual representation of an IPv6
address by concatenating "%" followed by &lt;zone_id>, where &lt;zone_id> is a string identifying the zone of the address.
However, RFC 4007 gives no precise definition of the character set allowed in &lt;zone_id>.
There are no rules or de facto standards for this. For example, the first Ethernet interface in a host
might be called %0, %1, %en1, %eth0, or whatever the implementer happened to choose.</t>

<t>In a URI, a literal IPv6 address is always embedded between "[" and "]". 
This document specifies that &lt;zone_id> may contain any ASCII character classified in RFC 3986
as "unreserved", which conveniently excludes "]" in order to simplify parsing. </t>

<t>There is an additional complication in that "%" is always treated as an escape
character in a URI, and according to RFC 3986 it must therefore itself be escaped in a URI, in the
form "%25". Thus, the scoped address fe80::a%en1 would appear in a produced URI as http://[fe80::a%25en1].
</t>

<t>
In RFC 3986, the IPv6 literal format is formally defined in ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/> by the following rule:
<figure><artwork>
   IP-literal = "[" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture  ) "]"
</artwork></figure>
</t>

<t>To provide support for a zone identifier, firstly a new rule is added:

<figure><artwork>
    ZoneID = 1*15unreserved
</artwork></figure>

Then two options are possible (to be discussed).
</t>


<t>OPTION 1:</t>
<t>The existing syntax of IPv6address is extended by adding a specific option
for the case of link-local addresses. The following definition of IPv6address
replaces that given in RFC 3986:
<figure><artwork>
   IPv6address =  6( h16 ":" ) ls32
                / "::" 5( h16 ":" ) ls32
                / [               h16 ] "::" 4( h16 ":" ) ls32
                / [ *1( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 3( h16 ":" ) ls32
                / [ *2( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 2( h16 ":" ) ls32
                / [ *3( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"    h16 ":"   ls32
                / [ *4( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              ls32
                / [ *5( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              h16
                / [ *6( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"
                / "fe80::" [ *3( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "%" ZoneID
</artwork></figure>
</t>
<t>OPTION 2:</t>
<t>The existing syntax of IPv6address is retained, and a zone identifier may be
added optionally to any literal address. This allows flexibility for unknown future
uses. The rule quoted above from RFC 3986 is replaced by two rules:
<figure><artwork>
   IP-literal = "[" ( IPv6addrz / IPvFuture  ) "]"
   
   IPv6addrz = IPv6address [ "%" ZoneID ]
</artwork></figure></t>

<t>The rules in <xref target="RFC5952"/> SHOULD be applied in producing URIs, and
the user MUST replace "%" by "%25" when manually constructing such a URI. </t>


</section> <!-- spec  -->


<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>The security considerations of  <xref target="RFC3986"/> and <xref target="RFC4007"/> apply. 
In particular, this URI format creates a specific pathway by which a deceitful zone
index might be communicated, as mentioned in the final security consideration of RFC 4007.
It is emphasised that the format is intended only for debugging purposes, but of course
this intention does not prevent misuse. </t>

<t>IF OPTION 2 IS CHOSEN:</t>
<t>To limit this risk, implementations SHOULD NOT allow use 
of the format except for link local addresses under prefix fe80::/10. </t>
