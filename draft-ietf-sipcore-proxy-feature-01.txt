               Indication of features supported by proxy
                draft-ietf-sipcore-proxy-feature-01.txt

Abstract

   This specification creates a new IANA registry, "SIP Feature Cap
   Registry", which is used to register indicators, "SIP feature caps",
   used by SIP entities to indicate support of features and
   capabilities, in cases where the Contact header field contains a URI
   that does not represent the SIP entity that wants to indicate support
   of its features and capabilities.

   This specification also defines a new SIP header field, Feature-Caps,
   that can be used by SIP entities to convey information about
   supported features and capabilities, using SIP feature caps.

Internet-Draft                proxy feature                   April 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] "Caller Preferences"
   extension, defined in RFC 3840 [RFC3840], provides a mechanism that
   allows a SIP message to convey information relating to the
   originator's features and capabilities, using the Contact header
   field.

   This specification creates a new IANA registry, "SIP Feature Cap
   Registry", which is used to register indicators, "SIP feature caps",
   that can be used by SIP entities to indicate support of features and
   capabilities, in cases where the Contact header field contains a URI
   that does not represent the SIP entity that wants to indicate support
   of its features and capabilities, and media feature tags cannot be
   used to indicate the support.  Such cases are:

   o  - The SIP entity acts as a SIP proxy.
   o  - The SIP entity acts as a SIP registrar.
   o  - The SIP entity acts as a B2BUA, where the Contact header field
      URI represents another SIP entity.

   This specification also defines a new SIP header field, Feature-Caps,
   that can be used by SIP entities to convey information about
   supported features and capabilities, using SIP feature caps.

   Unlike media feature tags, SIP feature caps are intended to only be
   used with the SIP protocol.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions

   Downstream SIP entity: SIP entity in the direction towards which a
   SIP request is sent.

   Upstream SIP entity: SIP entity in the direction from which a SIP
   request is received.

4.  SIP Feature Caps

4.1.  Introduction

   A SIP feature cap can be used by SIP entities to indicate support of
   features and capabilities, in cases where media feature tags cannot
   be used, ie if the Contact header field contains a URI that does not
   represent the SIP entity that wants to indicate support of its
   features and capabilities.

   A value, or a list of values, can be associated with a SIP feature
   cap.

   [ref-to-section] defines how SIP feature caps are conveyed using the
   SIP Feature-Caps header field.

4.2.  Syntax

4.2.1.  General

   In a SIP feature cap name (ABNF: fcap-name), dots can be used to
   implement a SIP feature cap tree hierarchy (e.g.
   tree.feature.subfeature).  The description of usage of such tree
   hierarchy must be described when registered.

4.2.2.  ABNF

   The ABNF for the Feature-Caps header field is:



   feature-cap       =  ["+"] fcap-name [EQUAL LDQUOT (fcap-value-list
                        / string-value ) RDQUOT]
   fcap-name         =  ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "!" / "'"
                        / "." / "-" / "%" )
   fcap-value-list   =  fcap-value *("," fcap-value)
   fcap-value        =  ["!"] (token-nobang / boolean / numeric)
   token-nobang      =  1*(alphanum / "-" / "." / "%" / "*"
                        / "_" / "+" / "`" / "'" / "~" )
   boolean           =  "TRUE" / "FALSE"
   numeric           =  "#" numeric-relation number
   numeric-relation  =  ">=" / "<=" / "=" / (number ":")
   number            =  [ "+" / "-" ] 1*DIGIT ["." 0*DIGIT]
   string-value      =  "<" *(qdtext-no-abkt / quoted-pair ) ">"
   qdtext-no-abkt    =  LWS / %x21 / %x23-3B / %x3D
                        / %x3F-5B / %x5D-7E / UTF8-NONASCII
                        ;;gdtext as defined in RFC 3261

4.3.  Registration Trees

4.3.1.  General

   The following subsections define registration "trees", distinguished
   by the use of faceted names (e.g., names of the form "tree.feature-
   name").

   The tree definitions are based on the global tree and sip tree
   defined for media feature tags, in RFC 2506 [RFC2506] and RFC 3841
   [RFC3841].

   Additional feature caps trees can be created by IANA, following the
   same rules and procedures as defined for media feature tags in
   section 3.1.4 of RFC 2506 [RFC2506].

   The acceptance of the proposed designation is at the discretion of
   IANA.  If IANA believes that additional information, or
   clarification, is needed, it can request an updated proposal from the
   proposing organization.

   When a SIP feature cap is registered in any registration tree, no
   leading "+" is used in the registration.

4.3.2.  Global Tree

   The SIP feature cap global tree is based on the media feature tag
   global tree defined in RFC 2506 [RFC2506].

   A SIP feature cap for the global tree will be registered by the IANA
   after review by a designated expert.  That review will serve to
   ensure that the SIP feature cap meets the technical requirements of
   this specification.

   A SIP feature cap in the global tree will be distinguished by the
   leading facet "g.".  An organization can propose either a designation
   indicative of the feature, (e.g., "g.blinktags") or a faceted
   designation including the organization name (e.g.,
   "g.organization.blinktags").

   When a SIP feature cap is registered in the global tree, it needs to
   meet the "Expert Review" policies defined in RFC 5226 [RFC5226].  A
   designated area expert will review the proposed SIP feature cap, and
   consult with members of related mailing lists.

4.3.3.  SIP Feature Cap Registration Tree

   The SIP feature cap sip tree is based on the media feature tag sip
   tree defined in RFC 3840 [RFC3840].

   A SIP feature cap in the sip tree will be distinguished by the
   leading facet "sip.".

   When a SIP feature cap is registered in the sip tree, it needs to
   meet the "IETF Consensus" policies defined in RFC 5226 [RFC5226].  An
   RFC, which contains the registration of the SIP feature cap, must be
   published.

4.5.  SIP Feature Cap Specification Requirements

4.5.1.  General

   A SIP feature cap specification MUST address the issues defined in
   the following subsections, or document why an issue is not applicable
   for the specific SIP feature cap.  A reference to the specification
   MUST be provided when the SIP feature cap is registered with IANA
   (see [ref-to-temp]).

   It is bad practice for SIP feature cap specifications to repeat
   procedures defined in this specification, unless needed for
   clarification or emphasis purpose.

   A SIP feature cap specification MUST NOT weaken any behavior
   designated with "SHOULD" or "MUST" in this specification.  However, a
   specification MAY strengthen "SHOULD", "MAY", or "RECOMMENDED"
   requirements to "MUST" strength if features associated with the SIP
   feature cap require it.

4.5.2.  Overall Description

   The SIP feature cap specification MUST contain an overall description
   of the SIP feature cap: how it is used to indicate support of a
   feature, a description of the feature associated with the SIP feature
   cap, and a description of any additional information (conveyed using
   one or more SIP feature cap values) that can be conveyed together
   with the SIP feature cap.

4.5.3.  Feature Cap Values

   A SIP feature cap can have an associated value, or a list of values.
   A SIP feature cap value MUST conform to the ABNF defined in
   Section 4.2.2.

   The SIP feature cap specification MUST define the syntax and
   semantics of any value defined for the SIP feature cap, including
   possible restrictions related to the usage of a specific value.

   A SIP feature cap value can share the name with a value defined for



Holmberg, et al.        Expires October 19, 2012                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                proxy feature                   April 2012


   another SIP feature cap.  However, a value defined for a SIP feature
   cap is feature cap specific, and can only be used with a SIP feature
   cap for which the value has explicitly been defined.

   It is STRONLY RECOMMENDED to not re-use a value name that already has
   been defined for another SIP feature cap, unless the semantics of the
   values are the same.

4.5.4.  Usage Restrictions

   If there are restrictions on how SIP entities can insert a SIP
   feature cap, the SIP feature cap specification MUST document such
   restrictions.

   There might be restrictions related to whether entities are allowed
   to insert a SIP feature cap in registration related messages,
   standalone transaction messages, or dialog related messages, whether
   entities are allowed to insert a SIP feature cap in requests or
   responses, whether entities also need to support other features in
   order to insert a SIP feature cap, and whether entities are allowed
   to indicate support of a feature in conjunction with another feature.

4.5.5.  Implementation Details

   The SIP feature cap specification SHOULD define the procedure
   regarding how implementers shall implement and use the Feature Cap,
   or refer to other locations where implementers can find that
   information.

   NOTE: Sometimes a SIP feature cap designer might choose to not reveal
   the implementation details of a SIP feature cap.  However, in order
   to allow multiple implementations to support the SIP feature cap,
   designers are strongly encouraged to provide the implementation
   details.

4.5.6.  Examples

   It is RECOMMENDED that the SIP feature cap specification provide
   demonstrative message flow diagrams, paired with complete messages
   and message descriptions.

   Note that example flows are by definition informative, and do not
   replace normative text.

5.1.  Introduction

   The Feature-Caps header field is used by SIP entities to convey
   support of features and capabilities, using SIP feature caps.  SIP
   feature caps inserted in a Feature-Caps header field indicate that
   the SIP entity that inserted the header field supports the associated
   features.

   NOTE: It is not possible to convey the address of the SIP entity as a
   Feature-Caps header field parameter.  Each feature that requires
   address information to be conveyed need to define a way to convey
   that information as part of the associated SIP feature cap value.

   The SIP feature cap specification MUST specify for which SIP methods
   and message types, and the associated semantics, the SIP feature cap
   is applicable.  See section [ref-to-reg-temp} for more information.
   No semantics is defined for SIP feature caps present in SIP methods
   and message types not covered by the associated SIP feature cap
   specification.

   Within a given Feature-Caps header field, SIP feature caps are listed
   in a non-priority order, and for a given header field any order of
   listed SIP feature caps have the same meaning.  For example,
   "foo;bar" and "bar;foo" have the same meaning(i.e. that the SIP
   entity that inserted the feature caps supports the features
   associated with the "foo" and "bar" SIP feature caps.

5.2.  User Agent and Proxy Behavior

5.2.1.  General

   If the URI in a Contact header field of a request or response
   represents a UA, the UA MUST NOT indicate supported features and
   capabilities using a Feature-Caps header field within that request or
   response.

   When a UA receives a SIP request, or response, that contains one or
   more Feature-Caps header fields, the Feature Caps in the header field
   inform the UA is about the features supported by the entities that
   inserted the header fields.  Procedures how features are invoked are
   outside the scope of this specification, and MUST be described by
   individual Feature Cap specifications.

   When the UA receives the SIP request or the response, the SIP feature
   caps in the topmost Feature-Caps header field will represent the
   supported features "closest" to the UA.

5.2.2.  B2BUA Behavior

   The procedures in this section applies to UAs that are part of
   B2BUAs, but where the URI in the Contact header field does not
   represent the UA, because the B2BUA is also acting as a proxy and
   inserts its URI e.g. in a Record-Route header field.

   When a UA sends a SIP request, if the UA wants to indicate support of
   features towards its downstream SIP entities, it adds a Feature-Caps
   header field to the request, together with one or more Feature Caps
   associated with the supported features, before it forwards the
   request.

   If the SIP request is triggered by another SIP request that the B2BUA
   has received, the UA MAY forward those Feature-Caps header field by
   copying them to the outgoing SIP request, similar to a SIP proxy,
   before it adds its own Feature-Caps header field to the SIP request.

   When a UA receives a SIP response, if the UA wants to indicate
   support of features towards its upstream SIP entities, it adds a
   Feature-Caps header field to the response, together with one or more
   Feature Caps associated with the supported features, before it
   forwards the response.

   If the SIP response is triggered by another SIP response that the
   B2BUA has received, the UA MAY forward those Feature-Caps header
   field by copying them to the outgoing SIP response, similar to a SIP
   proxy, before it adds its own Feature-Caps header field to the SIP
   response.

5.2.3.  Registrar Behavior

   If a SIP registrar wants to indicate support of features towards its
   upstream SIP entities, it can insert a Feature-Caps header field,
   together with Feature Caps associated with the supported features, in
   a REGISTER response.

5.2.4.  Proxy behavior

   When a SIP proxy receives a SIP request, if the proxy wants to
   indicate support of features towards its downstream SIP entities, it
   adds a Feature-Caps header field to the request, together with one or
   more SIP feature caps associated with the supported features, before
   it forwards the request.

   When a proxy adds a Feature-Caps header field to a SIP message, it
   MUST place the header field before any existing Feature-Caps header
   fields in the request.

   When a proxy receives a SIP response, if the proxy wants to indicate
   support of features towards its upstream SIP entities, it adds a
   Feature-Caps header field to the response, together with one or more
   SIP feature caps associated with the supported features, before it
   forwards the response.

   When a proxy adds a Feature-Caps header field to a SIP response, it
   MUST place the header field before any existing Feature-Caps header
   field in the response.

5.3.  SIP Message Type and Response Code Semantics

5.3.1.  General

   This section describes the general usage and semantics of the
   Feature-Caps header field for different SIP message types and
   response codes.  The usage and semantics of a specific SIP feature
   cap MUST be described in the associated SIP feature cap
   specification.

   NOTE: Future specifications can define usage and semantics of the
   Feature-Caps header field for SIP methods, response codes and request
   types not specified in this specification.

5.3.2.  SIP Dialog

   The Feature-Caps header field can be used within an initial SIP
   request for a dialog, within a target refresh SIP request, and within
   any 18x or 2xx response associated with such requests.

   If a SIP feature cap is inserted in a Feature-Caps header field of an
   initial request for a dialog, or within a response of such request,
   it indicates to the receivers of the request (or response) that the
   feature associated with the SIP feature cap is supported for the
   duration of the dialog, until a target refresh request is sent for
   the dialog, or the dialog is terminated.

   Unless a SIP feature cap is inserted in a Feature-Caps header field
   or a target refresh request, or within a response of such request, it
   indicates to the receivers of the request (or response) that the
   feature is no long supported for the dialog.

   For a given dialog a SIP entity MUST insert the same SIP feature caps
   in all 18x and 2xx responses associated with a given transaction.

5.3.3.  SIP Registration (REGISTER)

   The Feature-Caps header field can be used within a SIP REGISTER
   request, and within the 200 (OK) response associated with such
   request.

   If a SIP feature cap is inserted in a Feature-Caps header field of a
   SIP REGISTER request, or within a response of such request, it
   indicates to the receivers of the request (or response) that the
   feature associated with the SIP feature cap is supported for the
   duration of the registration, and for all SIP transactions associated
   with the registration, until the registration is re-freshed or
   terminated.

   Unless a SIP feature cap is inserted in a Feature-Caps header field
   or a re-registration, or within a response of such request, it
   indicates to the receivers of the request (or response) that the
   feature is no long supported for the registration.

5.3.4.  SIP Stand-Alone Transactions

   The Feature-Caps header field can be used within a standalone SIP
   request, and within any 18x or 2xx response associated with such
   request.

   If a SIP feature cap is inserted in a Feature-Caps header field of a
   standalone request, or within a response of such request, it
   indicates to the receivers of the request (or response) that the
   feature associated with the SIP feature cap is supported for the
   duration of the standalone transaction.

5.4.  Syntax

5.4.1.  ABNF

   The ABNF for the Feature-Caps header fields is:


   Feature-Caps = ("Feature-Caps" / "fc") HCOLON fc-value
                   *(COMMA fc-value)
   fc-value     = "*" *(SEMI feature-cap)


                              Figure 3: ABNF

   NOTE: A "*" value means that no information regarding which SIP
   entity, or domain, that indicate support of features is provided.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Registration of the Feature-Caps header field

   This specification registers a new SIP header field, Feature-Caps,
   according to the process of RFC 3261 [RFC3261].

   The following is the registration for the Feature-Caps header field:

   RFC Number: RFC XXX

   Header Field Name: Feature-Caps Header Field Name: Feature-Caps

   Compact Form: fc


7.  Security Considerations

   SIP feature caps can provide sensitive information about a SIP
   entity.  RFC 3840 cautions against providing sensitive information to
   another party.  Once this information is given out, any use may be
   made of it.
