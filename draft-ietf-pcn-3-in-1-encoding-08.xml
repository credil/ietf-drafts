    <abstract>
      <t>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
      quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain.
      The overall rate of the PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the PCN
      domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain configured
      rates are exceeded. Egress nodes pass information about these PCN-marks
      to decision points which then decide whether to admit or block new flow
      requests or to terminate some already-admitted flows during serious
      pre-congestion.</t>

      <t>This document specifies how PCN-marks are to be encoded into the IP
      header by re-using the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) codepoints
      within a PCN-domain. This encoding provides for up to three different
      PCN marking states using a single DSCP: not-marked (NM),
      threshold-marked (ThM) and excess-traffic-marked (ETM). Hence, it is
      called the 3-in-1 PCN encoding. This document obsoletes RFC5696.</t>

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) <xref
      target="RFC5559"></xref> is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of
      inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain, in a simple, scalable, and
      robust fashion. Two mechanisms are used: admission control, to decide
      whether to admit or block a new flow request, and flow termination to
      terminate some existing flows during serious pre-congestion. To achieve
      this, the overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the
      domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain configured
      rates are exceeded. These configured rates are below the rate of the
      link thus providing notification to boundary nodes about overloads
      before any real congestion occurs (hence "pre-congestion
      notification").</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5670"></xref> provides for two metering and marking
      functions that are generally configured with different reference rates.
      Threshold-marking marks all PCN packets once their traffic rate on a
      link exceeds the configured reference rate (PCN-threshold-rate).
      Excess-traffic-marking marks only those PCN packets that exceed the
      configured reference rate (PCN-excess-rate). The PCN-excess-rate is
      typically larger than the PCN-threshold-rate <xref
      target="RFC5559"></xref>. Egress nodes monitor the PCN-marks of received
      PCN-packets and pass information about these PCN-marks to decision
      points which then decide whether to admit new flows or terminate
      existing flows <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour"></xref>,
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-sm-edge-behaviour"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The encoding defined in <xref target="RFC5696"></xref> described how
      two PCN marking states (Not-marked and PCN-Marked) could be encoded into
      the IP header using a single Diffserv codepoint. It defined 01 as an
      experimental codepoint (EXP), along with guidelines for its use. Two PCN
      marking states are sufficient for the Single Marking edge behaviour
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-sm-edge-behaviour"></xref>. However,
      PCN-domains utilising the controlled load edge behaviour <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour"></xref> require three PCN
      marking states. This document extends the RFC5696 encoding by redefining
      the experimental codepoint as a third PCN marking state in the IP
      header, still using a single Diffserv codepoint. This encoding scheme is
      therefore called the "3-in-1 PCN encoding". It obsoletes the <xref
      target="RFC5696"></xref> encoding, which provides only a sub-set of the
      same capabilities.</t>

      <t>The full version of this encoding requires any tunnel endpoint within
      the PCN-domain to support the normal tunnelling rules defined in <xref
      target="RFC6040"></xref>. There is one limited exception to this
      constraint where the PCN-domain only uses the excess-traffic-marking
      behaviour and where the threshold-marking behaviour is deactivated. This
      is discussed in <xref target="pcn3in1_interior_ETM_only"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document only concerns the PCN wire protocol encoding for IP
      headers, whether IPv4 or IPv6. It makes no changes or recommendations
      concerning algorithms for congestion marking or congestion response.
      Other documents will define the PCN wire protocol for other header
      types. <xref target="pcn3in1_app_map_IP_MPLS"></xref> discusses a
      possible mapping between IP and MPLS.</t>

      <t>A PCN-node (i.e. a node within a PCN-domain) will be configured to
      recognise certain DSCPs as PCN-compatible. <xref
      target="pcn3in1_app_DSCP_choice"></xref> discusses the choice of
      suitable DSCPs. In <xref target="pcn3in1_Fig_Encoding"></xref> 'DSCP n'
      indicates such a PCN-compatible DSCP. Within the PCN-domain, any packet
      carrying a PCN-compatible DSCP and with the ECN-field anything other
      than 00 (Not-PCN) is a PCN-packet as defined in <xref
      target="RFC5559"></xref>.</t>

      <t>PCN-nodes MUST interpret the ECN field of a PCN-packet using the
      3-in-1 PCN encoding, rather than <xref target="RFC3168"></xref>. This
      does not change the behaviour for any packet with a DSCP that is not
      PCN-compatible, or for any node outside a PCN-domain. In all such cases
      the 3-in-1 encoding is not applicable and so by default the node will
      interpret the ECN field using <xref target="RFC3168"></xref>.</t>

        <t>In accordance with the PCN architecture <xref
        target="RFC5559"></xref>, PCN-ingress-nodes control packets entering a
        PCN-domain. Packets belonging to PCN-controlled flows are subject to
        PCN-metering and -marking, and PCN-ingress-nodes mark them as
        Not-marked (PCN-colouring). Any node in the PCN-domain may perform
        PCN-metering and -marking and mark PCN-packets if needed. There are
        two different metering and marking behaviours: threshold-marking and
        excess-traffic-marking <xref target="RFC5670"></xref>. Some edge
        behaviors require only a single marking behaviour <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pcn-sm-edge-behaviour"></xref>, others require both
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour"></xref>. In the latter
        case, three PCN marking states are needed: not-marked (NM) to indicate
        not-marked packets, threshold-marked (ThM) to indicate packets marked
        by the threshold-marker, and excess-traffic-marked (ETM) to indicate
        packets marked by the excess-traffic-marker <xref
        target="RFC5670"></xref>. Threshold-marking and excess-traffic-marking
        are configured to start marking packets at different load conditions,
        so one marking behaviour indicates more severe pre-congestion than the
        other. Therefore, a fourth PCN marking state indicating that a packet
        is marked by both markers is not needed. However a fourth codepoint is
        required to indicate packets that use a PCN-compatible DSCP but do not
        use PCN-marking (the not-PCN codepoint).</t>

        <t>In all current PCN edge behaviors that use two marking behaviours
        <xref target="RFC5559"></xref>, <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour"></xref>,
        excess-traffic-marking is configured with a larger reference rate than
        threshold-marking. We take this as a rule and define
        excess-traffic-marked as a more severe PCN-mark than
        threshold-marked.</t>

      <section anchor="pcn3in1_Requirements_Tunnelling"
               title="Requirements Imposed by Tunnelling">
        <t><xref target="RFC6040"></xref> defines rules for the encapsulation
        and decapsulation of ECN markings within IP-in-IP tunnels. The
        publication of RFC6040 removed the tunnelling constraints that existed
        when the encoding of <xref target="RFC5696"></xref> was written (see
        section 3.3.2 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pcn-encoding-comparison"></xref>).</t>

        <t>Nonetheless, there is still a problem if there are any legacy
        (pre-RFC6040) decapsulating tunnel endpoints within a PCN domain. If a
        PCN node Threshold-marks the outer header of a tunnelled packet that
        has a Not-marked codepoint on the inner header, a legacy decapsulator
        will forward the packet as Not-marked, losing the threshold marking.
        The rules on applicability in <xref
        target="pcn3in1_Requirements_Applicability"></xref> below are designed
        to avoid this problem.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="pcn3in1_Requirements_Applicability"
               title="Applicability of 3-in-1 PCN Encoding">
        <t>The 3-in-1 encoding is applicable in situations where two marking
        behaviours are being used in the PCN-domain. The 3-in-1 encoding can
        also be used with only one marking behaviour, in which case one of the
        codepoints MUST NOT be used throughout the PCN-domain (see <xref
        target="pcn3in1_interior_one_mark_behaviour"></xref>).</t>

        <t>With one exception (see next paragraph), any tunnel endpoints
        (IP-in-IP and IPsec) within the PCN-domain MUST comply with the ECN
        encapsulation and decapsulation rules set out in <xref
        target="RFC6040"></xref> (see <xref
        target="pcn3in1_Requirements_Tunnelling"></xref>).</t>

        <t>It may not be possible to upgrade every pre-RFC6040 tunnel endpoint
        within a PCN-domain. In such circumstances a limited version of the
        3-in-1 encoding can still be used but only under the following
        stringent condition. If any pre-RFC6040 tunnel endpoint exists within
        a PCN-domain then every PCN-node in the PCN-domain MUST be configured
        so that it never sets the ThM codepoint. PCN-interior nodes in this
        case MUST solely use the Excess Traffic marking function, as defined
        in <xref target="pcn3in1_interior_ETM_only"></xref>. In all other
        situations where legacy tunnel endpoints might be present within the
        PCN domain, the 3-in-1 encoding is not applicable.</t>

        <t>PCN-traffic MUST be marked with a PCN-compatible Diffserv

        <t>If a packet arrives at the PCN-ingress-node that shares a

      <section title="Backward Compatibility with ECN">
        <t>BCP 124 <xref target="RFC4774"></xref> gives guidelines for
        specifying alternative semantics for the ECN field. It sets out a
        number of factors to be taken into consideration. It also suggests
        various techniques to allow the co-existence of default ECN and
        alternative ECN semantics. The encoding specified in this document
        uses one of those techniques; it defines PCN-compatible Diffserv
        codepoints as no longer supporting the default ECN semantics within a
        PCN domain. As such, this document is compatible with BCP 124.</t>

        <t>On its own, the 3-in-1 encoding cannot support both ECN marking
        end-to-end (e2e) and PCN-marking within a PCN-domain. <xref
        target="pcn3in1_app_ecn_coexist"></xref> discusses possible ways to do
        this, e.g. by carrying e2e ECN across a PCN-domain within the inner
        header of an IP-in-IP tunnel. Although <xref
        target="pcn3in1_app_ecn_coexist"></xref> recommends various approaches
        over others, it is merely informative and all such schemes are beyond
        the normative scope of this document.</t>

        <t>In any PCN deployment, traffic can only enter the PCN-domain
        through PCN-ingress-nodes and leave through PCN-egress-nodes.
        PCN-ingress-nodes ensure that any packets entering the PCN-domain have
        the ECN field in their outermost IP header set to the appropriate
        codepoint. PCN-egress-nodes then guarantee that the ECN field of any
        packet leaving the PCN-domain has appropriate ECN semantics. This
        prevents unintended leakage of ECN marks into or out of the
        PCN-domain, and thus reduces backward-compatibility issues.</t>

      <section title="Backward Compatibility with the RFC5696 Encoding">
        <t>A PCN node implemented to use the obsoleted RFC5696 encoding could
        conceivably have been configured so that the Threshold-meter function
        marked what is now defined as the ETM codepoint in the 3-in-1
        encoding. However, there is no known deployment of such an
        implementation and no reason to believe that such an implementation
        would ever have been built. Therefore, it seems safe to ignore this

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_Sec_Consider" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>PCN-marking only carries a meaning within the confines of a
      PCN-domain. This encoding document is intended to stand independently of
      the architecture used to determine how specific packets are authorised
      to be PCN-marked, which will be described in separate documents on
      PCN-boundary-node behaviour.</t>

      <t>This document assumes the PCN-domain to be entirely under the control
      of a single operator, or a set of operators who trust each other.
      However, future extensions to PCN might include inter-domain versions
      where trust cannot be assumed between domains. If such schemes are
      proposed, they must ensure that they can operate securely despite the
      lack of trust. However, such considerations are beyond the scope of this
      document.</t>

      <t>One potential security concern is the injection of spurious PCN-marks
      into the PCN-domain. However, these can only enter the domain if a
      PCN-ingress-node is misconfigured. The precise impact of any such
      misconfiguration will depend on which of the proposed PCN-boundary-node
      behaviours is used, but in general spurious marks will lead to admitting
      fewer flows into the domain or potentially terminating too many flows.
      In either case, good management should be able to quickly spot the
      problem since the overall utilisation of the domain will rapidly
      fall.</t>

      <t>The 3-in-1 PCN encoding uses a PCN-compatible DSCP and the ECN field

      three PCN marking states with different levels of severity. In general,

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_app_DSCP_choice" title="Choice of Suitable DSCPs">
      <t>This appendix is informative, not normative.</t>

      <t>A single DSCP has not been defined for use with PCN for several
      reasons. Firstly, the PCN mechanism is applicable to a variety of
      different traffic classes. Secondly, Standards Track DSCPs are in
      increasingly short supply. Thirdly, PCN is not a scheduling behaviour --
      rather, it should be seen as being a marking behaviour similar to ECN
      but intended for inelastic traffic. The choice of which DSCP is most
      suitable for a given PCN-domain is dependent on the nature of the
      traffic entering that domain and the link rates of all the links making
      up that domain. In PCN-domains with sufficient aggregation, the
      appropriate DSCPs would currently be those for the Real-Time Treatment
      Aggregate <xref target="RFC5127"></xref>. It is suggested that admission
      control could be used for the following service classes (defined in
      <xref target="RFC4594"></xref> unless otherwise stated): <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Telephony (EF)</t>

          <t>Real-time interactive (CS4)</t>

          <t>Broadcast Video (CS3)</t>

          <t>Multimedia Conferencing (AF4)</t>

          <t>the VOICE-ADMIT codepoint defined in <xref
          target="RFC5865"></xref>.</t>
        </list>CS5 is excluded from this list since PCN is not expected to be
      applied to signalling traffic.</t>

      <t>PCN-marking is intended to provide a scalable admission-control
      mechanism for traffic with a high degree of statistical multiplexing.
      PCN-marking would therefore be appropriate to apply to traffic in the
      above classes, but only within a PCN-domain containing sufficiently
      aggregated traffic. In such cases, the above service classes may well
      all be subject to a single forwarding treatment (treatment aggregate
      <xref target="RFC5127"></xref>). However, this does not imply all such
      IP traffic would necessarily be identified by one DSCP -- each service
      class might keep a distinct DSCP within the highly aggregated region
      <xref target="RFC5127"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Additional service classes may be defined for which admission control
      is appropriate, whether through some future standards action or through
      local use by certain operators, e.g., the Multimedia Streaming service
      class (AF3). This document does not preclude the use of PCN in more
      cases than those listed above.</t>

      <t>Note: The above discussion is informative not normative, as operators
      are ultimately free to decide whether to use admission control for
      certain service classes and whether to use PCN as their mechanism of
      choice.</t>

             title="Co-existence of ECN and PCN">
      <t>This appendix is informative, not normative.</t>

      <t>The PCN encoding described in this document re-uses the bits of the
      ECN field in the IP header. Consequently, this disables ECN within the
      PCN domain. Appendix B of <xref target="RFC5696"></xref> (obsoleted)
      included advice on handling ECN traffic within a PCN-domain. This
      appendix reiterates and clarifies that advice.</t>

      <t>For the purposes of this appendix we define two forms of traffic that
      might arrive at a PCN-ingress-node. These are admission-controlled
      traffic and non-admission-controlled traffic.</t>

      <t>Admission-controlled traffic will be re-marked to a PCN-compatible
      DSCP by the PCN-ingress-node. Two mechanisms can be used to identify
      such traffic: <list style="letters">
          <t>Flow signalling, which associates a filterspec with a need for
          admission control (e.g. through RSVP or some equivalent message,
          e.g. from a SIP server to the ingress); the PCN-ingress-node
          re-marks traffic matching that filterspec to a PCN-compatible
          DSCP.</t>

          <t>Traffic arrives with a DSCP that implies it requires admission
          control such as VOICE-ADMIT <xref target="RFC5865"></xref> or
          Real-Time Interactive, Broadcast Video when used for video on
          demand, and multimedia conferencing <xref
          target="RFC4594"></xref><xref target="RFC5865"></xref> (see <xref
          target="pcn3in1_app_DSCP_choice"></xref>).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>All other traffic can be thought of as non-admission-controlled (and
      therefore outside the scope of PCN). However such traffic may still need
      to share the same DSCP as the admission-controlled traffic. This may be
      due to policy (for instance if it is high priority voice traffic), or
      may be because there is a shortage of local DSCPs.</t>

      <t>ECN <xref target="RFC3168"></xref> is an end-to-end congestion
      notification mechanism. As such it is possible that some traffic
      entering the PCN-domain may also be ECN capable.</t>

      <t>Unless specified otherwise, for any of the cases in the list below,
      an IP-in-IP tunnel can be used to preserve ECN markings across the PCN
      domain. The tunnelling action should be applied wholly outside the
      PCN-domain as illustrated in the following figure:</t>

      <t>There are three cases for how e2e ECN traffic may wish to be treated
      while crossing a PCN domain: <list style="hanging">
          <t
          hangText="a) Traffic that does not require admission control:"><vspace
          blankLines="0" />For example, traffic that does not match flow
          signaling being used for admission control. In this case the e2e ECN
          traffic is not treated as PCN-traffic. There are two possible
          scenarios:<list style="symbols">
              <t>Arriving traffic does not carry a PCN-compatible DSCP: no
              action required.</t>

              <t>Arriving traffic carries a DSCP that clashes with a
              PCN-compatible DSCP. There are two options:<list style="numbers">
                  <t>The ingress maps the DSCP to a local DSCP with the same
                  scheduling PHB as the original DSCP, and the egress re-maps
                  it to the original PCN-compatible DSCP.</t>

                  <t>The ingress tunnels the traffic, setting not-PCN in the
                  outer header; note that this turns off ECN for this traffic
                  within the PCN domain.</t>
                </list>The first option is recommended unless the operator is
              short of local DSCPs.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t hangText="b) Traffic that requires admission-control:"><vspace
          blankLines="0" />In this case the e2e ECN traffic is treated as
          PCN-traffic across the PCN domain. There are two options.<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>The PCN-ingress-node places this traffic in a tunnel with a
              PCN-compatible DSCP in the outer header. The PCN-egress zeroes
              the ECN-field before decapsulation.</t>

              <t>The PCN-ingress-node drops CE-marked packets and otherwise
              sets the ECN-field to NM and sets the DCSP to a PCN-compatible
              DSCP. The PCN-egress zeroes the ECN field of all PCN packets;
              note that this turns off e2e ECN.</t>
            </list>The second option is emphatically not recommended, unless
          perhaps as a last resort if tunnelling is not possible for some
          insurmountable reason.</t>

          <t
          hangText="c) Traffic that requires admission control where the endpoints ask to see PCN marks:"><vspace
          blankLines="0" />Note that this scheme is currently only a tentative
          idea.<vspace blankLines="1" />For real-time data generated by an
          adaptive codec, schemes have been suggested where PCN marks may be
          leaked out of the PCN-domain so that end hosts can drop to a lower
          data rate, thus deferring the need for admission control. Currently
          such schemes require further study and the following is for guidance
          only.<vspace blankLines="1" />The PCN-ingress-node needs to tunnel
          the traffic as in <xref target="pcn3in1_Fig_Tunnel"></xref>, taking
          care to comply with <xref target="RFC6040"></xref>. In this case the
          PCN-egress does not zero the ECN field contrary to the
          recommendation in <xref target="pcn3in1_egress_behaviour"></xref>,
          so that the <xref target="RFC6040"></xref> tunnel egress will
          preserve any PCN-marking. Note that a PCN interior node may change
          the ECN-field from 10 to 01 (NM to ThM), which would be interpreted
          by the e2e ECN as a change from ECT(0) into ECT(1). This would not
          be compatible with the (currently experimental) ECN nonce <xref
          target="RFC3540"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_app_map_IP_MPLS"
             title="Example Mapping between Encoding of PCN-Marks in IP and in MPLS Shim Headers">
      <t>This appendix is informative not normative.</t>

      <t>The 6 bits of the DS field in the IP header provide for 64
      codepoints. When encapsulating IP traffic in MPLS, it is useful to make
      the DS field information accessible in the MPLS header. However, the
      MPLS shim header has only a 3-bit traffic class (TC) field <xref
      target="RFC5462"></xref> providing for 8 codepoints. The operator has
      the freedom to define a site-local mapping of the 64 codepoints of the
      DS field onto the 8 codepoints in the TC field.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5129"></xref> describes how ECN markings in the IP
      header can also be mapped to codepoints in the MPLS TC field. Appendix A
      of <xref target="RFC5129"></xref> gives an informative description of
      how to support PCN in MPLS by extending the way MPLS supports ECN. <xref
      target="RFC5129"></xref> was written while PCN specifications were in
      early draft stages. The following provides a clearer example of a
      mapping between PCN in IP and in MPLS using the PCN terminology and
      concepts that have since been specified.</t>

      <t>To support PCN in a MPLS domain, a PCN-compatible DSCP ('DSCP n')
      needs codepoints to be provided in the TC field for all the PCN-marks
      used. That means, when for instance only excess-traffic-marking is used
      for PCN purposes, the operator needs to define a site-local mapping to
      two codepoints in the MPLS TC field for IP headers with: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>DSCP n and NM</t>

          <t>DSCP n and ETM</t>
        </list> If both excess-traffic-marking and threshold-marking are used,
      the operator needs to define a site-local mapping to codepoints in the
      MPLS TC field for IP headers with all three of the 3-in-1 codepoints:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>DSCP n and NM</t>

          <t>DSCP n and ThM</t>

          <t>DSCP n and ETM</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In either case, if the operator wishes to support the same Diffserv
      PHB but without PCN marking, it will also be necessary to define a
      site-local mapping to an MPLS TC codepoint for IP headers marked with:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>DSCP n and Not-PCN</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The above sets of codepoints are required for every PCN-compatible
      DSCP. Clearly, given so few TC codepoints are available, it may be
      necessary to compromise by merging together some capabilities.</t>

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_app_rationale_diff_sm"
             title="Rationale for Difference Between the Schemes using One PCN-Marking">
      <t>Readers may notice a difference between the two behaviours in <xref
      target="pcn3in1_interior_ETM_only"></xref> and <xref
      target="pcn3in1_interior_ThM_only"></xref>. With only excess-traffic
      marking enabled, an unexpected ThM packet can be re-marked to ETM.
      However, with only Threshold-marking, an unexpected ETM packet cannot be
      re-marked to ThM.</t>

      <t>This apparent inconsistency is deliberate. The behaviour with only
      threshold marking keeps to the rule of <xref
      target="pcn3in1_common_interior_behaviour"></xref> that ETM is more
      severe and must never be changed to ThM even though ETM is not a valid
      marking in this case. Otherwise implementations would have to allow
      operators to configure an exception to this rule, which would not be
      safe practice and would require different code in the data plane
      compared to the common behaviour.</t>
