1. Introduction

   Site renumbering is difficult. Network managers frequently attempt to
   avoid renumbering by numbering their network resources from Provider
   Independent (PI) address space. However, widespread use of PI might
   create serious BGP4 scaling problems and according to Regional
   Internet Registry (RIR) policies, PI space is not always available
   for enterprises Therefore, it is desirable to develop mechanisms that
   simplify IPv6 renumbering.

   This document undertakes scenario descriptions, including
   documentation of current capabilities and existing BCPs, for
   enterprise networks. It takes [RFC5887] and other relevant documents
   as the primary input.

   Since the IPv4 and IPv6 are logically separated from the perspective
   of renumbering, regardless of overlapping of the IPv4/IPv6 networks
   or devices, this document focuses on IPv6 only, by leaving IPv4 out
   of scope. Dual-stack network or IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios are
   out of scope, too.

   This document focuses on enterprise network renumbering, however,
   most of the analysis is also applicable to ISP network renumbering.
   Renumbering in home networks is out of scope, but it can also benefit
   from the analysis in this document.

   The concept of enterprise network and a typical network illustration
   are introduced first. Then, best renumbering practices are introduced
   according to the following categories: those applicable during
   network design, those applicable during preparation for renumbering,
   and those applicable during the renumbering operation.

2. Enterprise Network Illustration for Renumbering

   An Enterprise Network as defined in [RFC4057] is: a network that has
   multiple internal links, one or more router connections to one or
   more Providers, and is actively managed by a network operations
   entity.

   Figure 1 provides a sample enterprise network architecture. Those
   entities relevant to renumbering are highlighted.

   Address reconfiguration is fulfilled either by Dynamic Host
   configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) or Neighbor Discovery for
   IPv6 (ND) protocols. During the renumbering event, the Domain Name
   Service (DNS) records need to be synchronized while routing tables,

   Access Control Lists (ACLs) and IP filtering tables in various
   devices also need to be updated, too.

   Static address issue is described in a dedicated draft
   [I-D.ietf-6renum-static-problem].

3. Enterprise Network Renumbering Scenario Categories

   In this section, we divide enterprise network renumbering scenarios
   into two categories defined by external and internal network factors,
   which require renumbering for different reasons.

3.1. Renumbering Caused by External Network Factors

   The following ISP uplink-related events can cause renumbering:


Jiang, et al.               May 27, 2013                      [Page 4]

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-6renum-enterprise-04.txt      November 2012


   o The enterprise network switches to a new ISP. When this occurs,
      the enterprise stop numbering its resources form the prefix
      allocated by the old ISP and renumbers its resources from the
      prefix allocated by the new ISP.

      When the enterprise switches ISPs, a "flag day" renumbering event
      [RFC4192] may be averted if, during a transitional period, the
      enterprise network may number its resources from either prefix.
      One way to facilitate such a transitional period is for the
      enterprise to contract for service from both ISPs during the
      transition.

   o The renumbering event can be initiated by receiving new prefixes
      from the same uplink. This might happen if the enterprise network
      is switched to a different location within the network topology of
      the same ISP due to various considerations, such as commercial,
      performance or services reasons, etc. Alternatively, the ISP
      itself might be renumbered due to topology changes or migration to
      a different or additional prefix. These ISP renumbering events
      would initiate enterprise network renumbering events, of course.

   o The enterprise network adds new uplink(s) for multihoming purposes.
      This might not be a typical renumbering case because the original
      addresses will not be changed. However, initial numbering may be
      considered as a special renumbering event. The enterprise network
      removes uplink(s) or old prefixes.

3.2. Renumbering caused by Internal Network Factors

   o As companies split, merge, grow, relocate or reorganize, the
      enterprise network architectures might need to be re-built. This
      will trigger the internal renumbering.

   o The enterprise network might proactively adopt a new address
      scheme, for example by switching to a new transition mechanism or
      stage of a transition plan.

   o The enterprise network might reorganize its topology or subnets.

4. Network Renumbering Considerations and Best Current Practices

   In order to carry out renumbering in an enterprise network,
   systematic planning and administrative preparation are needed.
   Carefully planning and preparation could make the renumbering process
   smoother.




Jiang, et al.               May 27, 2013                      [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-6renum-enterprise-04.txt      November 2012


   This section recommends some solutions or strategies for the
   enterprise renumbering, chosen among existing mechanisms. There are
   known gaps analyzed by [I-D.ietf-6renum-gap-analysis]. If these gaps
   are filled in the future, the enterprise renumbering can be processed
   more automatically, with fewer issues.

4.1. Considerations and Best Current Practices during Network Design

   This section describes the consideration or issues relevant to
   renumbering that a network architect should carefully plan when
   building or designing a new network.

      - Prefix Delegation

      In a large or a multi-site enterprise network, the prefix should
      be carefully managed, particularly during renumbering events.
      Prefix information needs to be delegated from router to router.
      The DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation options [RFC3633] and
      [RFC6603] provide a mechanism for automated delegation of IPv6
      prefixes. Normally, DHCPv6 PD options are used between the
      internal enterprise routers, for example, a router receives
      prefix (es) from its upstream router (might be a border gateway or
      edge router .etc) through DHCPv6 PD options and then advertise it
      (them) to the local hosts through RA messages.

      - Usage of FQDN

      In general, Fully-Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) are recommended
      to be used to configure network connectivity, such as tunnels,
      servers etc. The capability to use FQDNs as endpoint names has
      been standardized in several RFCs, such as [RFC5996], although
      many system/network administrators do not realize that it is there
      and works well as a way to avoid manual modification during
      renumbering.

      Note that, using FQDN would rely on DNS systems. For a link local
      network that does not have a DNS system, multicast DNS
      [I-D.cheshire-dnsext-multicastdns] could be utilized. For some
      specific circumstances, using FQDN might not be proper if adding
      DNS service in the node/network would cause un-desired complexity
      or issues.

      Service discovery protocols such as Service Location Protocol
      [RFC2608], multicast DNS with SRV records and DNS Service
      Discovery [I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd] can engage using FQDN and
      reduce the number of places that IP addresses need to be

      configured. But it should be noted that these protocols are
      normally used link-local only.

      - Usage of ULA

      Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) are defined in [RFC4193] as
      provider-independent prefixes. And since there is a 40 bits pseudo
      random field in the ULA prefix, there is no practical risk of
      collision (please refer to section 3.2.3 in [RFC4193] for more
      detail). For enterprise networks, using ULA along with PA can
      provide a logically local routing plane separated from the
      globally routing plane. The benefit is to ensure stable and
      specific local communication regardless of the ISP uplink failure.
      This benefit is especially meaningful for renumbering. It mainly
      includes three use cases as the following.

      During the transition period, it is desirable to isolate local
      communication changes in the global routing plane. If we use ULA
      for the local communication, this isolation is achieved.

      Enterprise administrators might want to avoid the need to renumber
      their internal-only, private nodes when they have to renumber the
      PA addresses of the whole network because of changing ISPs, ISPs
      restructuring their address allocation, or any other reasons. In
      these situations, ULA is an effective tool for the internal-only
      nodes.

      For multicast, ULA can be a way of avoiding renumbering from
      having an impact on multicast. In most deployments multicast is
      only used internally (intra-domain), and the addresses used for
      multicast sources and Rendezvous-Points need not be reachable nor
      routable externally. Hence one may at least internally make use of
      ULA for multicast specific infrastructure.

      - Address Types

      This document focuses on the dynamically-configured global unicast
      addresses in enterprise networks. They are the targets of
      renumbering events.

      Manual-configured addresses are not scalable in medium to large
      sites, hence are out of scope. Manually-configured addresses/hosts
      should be avoided as much as possible.

      - Address configuration models




Jiang, et al.               May 27, 2013                      [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-6renum-enterprise-04.txt      November 2012


      In IPv6 networks, there are two auto-configuration models for
      address assignment: Stateless Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC,
      [RFC4862]) by Neighbor Discovery (ND, [RFC4861]) and stateful
      address configuration by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for
      IPv6 (DHCPv6, [RFC3315]). In the latest work, DHCPv6 can also
      support host-generated address model by assigning a prefix through
      DHCPv6 messages [I-D.ietf-dhc-host-gen-id].

      ND is considered easier to renumber by broadcasting a Router
      Advertisement message with a new prefix. DHCPv6 can also trigger
      the renumbering process by sending unicast RECONFIGURE messages,
      though it might cause a large number of interactions between hosts
      and DHCPv6 server.

      This document has no preference between ND and DHCPv6 address
      configuration models. It is network architects' job to decide
      which configuration model is employed. But it should be noticed
      that using DHCPv6 and ND together within one network, especially
      in one subnet, might cause operational issues. For example, some
      hosts use DHCPv6 as the default configuration model while some use
      ND. Then the hosts' address configuration model depends on the
      policies of operating systems and cannot be controlled by the
      network. Section 5.1 of [I-D.ietf-6renum-gap-analysis] discusses
      more details on this topic. So, in general, this document
      recommends using DHCPv6/SLAAC independently in different subnets.

      However, since DHCPv6 is also used to configure many other network
      parameters, there are ND and DHCPv6 co-existence scenarios.
      Combinations of address configuration models might coexist within
      a single enterprise network. [I-D.ietf-savi-mix] provides
      recommendations to avoid collisions and to review collision
      handling in such scenarios.

      - DNS

      It is recommended that the site have an automatic and systematic
      procedure for updating/synchronizing its DNS records, including
      both forward and reverse mapping [RFC2874]. A manual on-demand
      updating model does not scale, and increases the chance of errors.

      Although the A6 DNS record model [RFC2874] was designed for easier
      renumbering, it left many unsolved technical issues [RFC3364].
      Therefore, it has been moved to historic status [RFC6563] and is
      not recommended.





Jiang, et al.               May 27, 2013                      [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-6renum-enterprise-04.txt      November 2012


      In order to simplify the operational procedure, the network
      architect should combine the forward and reverse DNS updates in a
      single procedure.

      Often, a small site depends on its ISP's DNS system rather than
      maintaining its own. When renumbering, this requires
      administrative coordination between the site and its ISP.

      The DNS synchronization can be completed through the Secure DNS
      Dynamic Update [RFC3007]. Dynamic DNS update can be provided by
      the DHCPv6 client or by the server on behalf of individual hosts.
      [RFC4704] defined a DHCPv6 option to be used by DHCPv6 clients and
      servers to exchange information about the client's FQDN and about
      who has the responsibility for updating the DNS with the
      associated AAAA and PTR (Pointer Record) RRs (Resource Records).
      For example, if a client wants the server to update the FQDN-
      address mapping in the DNS server, it can include the Client FQDN
      option with proper settings in the SOLICIT with Rapid Commit,
      REQUEST, RENEW, and REBIND message originated by the client. When
      DHCPv6 server gets this option, it can use the dynamic DNS update
      on behalf of the client. In this document, we promote to support
      this FQDN option. But since it's a DHCPv6 option, it implies that
      only the DHCP-managed networks are suitable for this operation. In
      SLAAC mode, sometimes hosts also need to register addresses on a
      registration server, which could in fact be a DHCPv6 server (as
      described in [I-D.ietf-dhc-addr-registration]); then the server
      would update corresponding DNS records.

      - Security

      Any automatic renumbering scheme has a potential exposure to
      hijacking. Malicious entity in the network can forge prefixes to
      renumber the hosts. So proper network security mechanisms are
      needed.

      For ND, Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND, [RFC3971]) is a possible
      solution, but it is complex and there's almost no real deployment
      so far. Comparing the non-trivial deployment of SEND, RA guard
      [RFC6105] is a light-weight alternative, which focuses on rogue
      router advertisements proof in a L2 network. However, it also
      hasn't been widely deployed since it hasn't been published for
      long.

      For DHCPv6, there are built-in secure mechanisms (like Secure
      DHCPv6 [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6]), and authentication of DHCPv6
      messages [RFC3315] could be utilized. But these security
      mechanisms also haven't been verified by wide real deployment.

      - Miscellaneous

      A site or network should also avoid embedding addresses from other
      sites or networks in its own configuration data. Instead, the
      Fully-Qualified Domain Names should be used. Thus, these
      connections can survive after renumbering events at other sites.
      This also applies to host-based connectivity.

4.2. Considerations and Best Current Practices for the Preparation of
   Renumbering

   In ND, it is not possible to reduce a prefix's lifetime to below two
   hours. So, renumbering should not be an unplanned sudden event. This
   issue could only be avoided by early planning and preparation.

   This section describes several recommendations for the preparation of
   enterprise renumbering event. By adopting these recommendations, a
   site could be renumbered more easily. However, these recommendations
   might increase the daily traffic, server load, or burden of network
   operation. Therefore, only those networks that are expected to be
   renumbered soon or very frequently should adopt these recommendations,
   with balanced consideration between daily cost and renumbering cost.

      - Reduce the address preferred time or valid time or both.

      Long-lifetime addresses might cause issues for renumbering events.
      Particularly, some offline hosts might reconnect using these
      addresses after renumbering events. Shorter preferred lifetimes
      with relatively long valid lifetimes may allow short transition
      periods for renumbering events and avoid frequent address renewals.

      - Reduce the DNS record TTL on the local DNS server.

      The DNS AAAA resource record TTL on the local DNS server should be
      manipulated to ensure that stale addresses are not cached.

      Recent research [BA2011] [JSBM2002] indicates that it is both
      practical and reasonable for A, AAAA, and PTR records that belong
      to leaf nodes of the DNS (i.e. not including the DNS root or DNS
      top-level domains) to be configured with very short DNS TTL values,
      not only during renumbering events, but also for longer-term
      operation.

      - Reduce the DNS configuration lifetime on the hosts.

      Since the DNS server could be renumbered as well, the DNS
      configuration lifetime on the hosts should also be reduced if

      renumbering events are expected. In ND, The DNS configuration can
      be done through reducing the lifetime value in RDNSS option
      [RFC6106]. In DHCPv6, the DNS configuration option specified in
      [RFC3646] doesn't provide lifetime attribute, but we can reduce
      the DHCPv6 client lease time to achieve similar effect.

      - Identify long-living sessions

      Any applications which maintain very long transport connections
      (hours or days) should be identified in advance, if possible. Such
      applications will need special handling during renumbering, so it
      is important to know that they exist.

4.3. Considerations and Best Current Practices during Renumbering
   Operation

   Renumbering events are not instantaneous events. Normally, there is a
   transition period, in which both the old prefix and the new prefix
   are used in the site. Better network design and management, better
   pre-preparation and longer transition period are helpful to reduce
   the issues during renumbering operation.

      - Within/without a flag day

      As is described in [RFC4192], "a 'flag day' is a procedure in
      which the network, or a part of it, is changed during a planned
      outage, or suddenly, causing an outage while the network
      recovers."

      If renumbering event is processed within a flag day, the network
      service/connectivity will be unavailable for a period until the
      renumbering event is completed. It is efficient and provides
      convenience for network operation and management. But network
      outage is usually unacceptable for end users and enterprises. A
      renumbering procedure without a flag day provides smooth address
      switching, but much more operational complexity and difficulty is
      introduced.

      - Transition period

      If renumbering transition period is longer than all address
      lifetimes, after which the address leases expire, each host will
      automatically pick up its new IP address. In this case, it would
      be the DHCPv6 server or Router Advertisement itself that
      automatically accomplishes client renumbering.

      Address deprecation should be associated with the deprecation of
      associated DNS records. The DNS records should be deprecated as
      early as possible, before the addresses themselves.

      - Network initiative enforced renumbering

      If the network has to enforce renumbering before address leases
      expire, the network should initiate DHCPv6 RECONFIGURE messages.
      For some operating systems such as Windows 7, if the hosts receive
      RA messages with ManagedFlag=0, they'll release the DHCPv6
      addresses and do SLAAC according to the prefix information in the
      RA messages, so this could be another enforcement method for some
      specific scenarios.

      - Impact to branch/main sites

      Renumbering in main/branch site might cause impact on branch/main
      site communication. The routes, ingress filtering of site's
      gateways, and DNS might need to be updated. This needs careful
      planning and organizing.

      - DNS record update and DNS configuration on hosts

      DNS records on the local DNS server should be updated if hosts are
      renumbered. If the site depends on ISP's DNS system, it should
      report the new host's DNS records to its ISP. During the
      transition period, both old and new DNS records are valid. If the
      TTLs of DNS records are shorter than the transition period, an
      administrative operation might not be necessary.

      DNS configuration on hosts should be updated if local recursive
      DNS servers are renumbered. During the transition period, both old
      and new DNS server addresses might co-exist on the hosts. If the
      lifetime of DNS configuration is shorter than the transition
      period, name resolving failure may be reduced to minimum.

      - Tunnel concentrator renumbering

      A tunnel concentrator itself might be renumbered. This change
      should be reconfigured in relevant hosts or routers, unless the
      configuration of tunnel concentrator was based on FQDN.

      For IPSec, [RFC2230] defines the KX (Key eXchange) record, which
      could be used to help locate the domain-name for an IPsec VPN
      concentrator associated with a site's domain name. For current
      practice, the community needs to change its bad habit of using

      IPsec in an address-oriented way, and renumbering is one of the
      main reasons for that.

      - Connectivity session survivability

      During the renumbering operations, connectivity sessions in IP
      layer would break if the old address is deprecated before the
      session ends. However, the upper layer sessions can survive by
      using session survivability technologies, such as SHIM6 [RFC5533].
      As mentioned above, some long-living applications may need to be
      handled specially.

5. Security Considerations

   As noted, a site that is listed by IP address in a black list can
   escape that list by renumbering itself.

   Any automatic renumbering scheme has a potential exposure to
   hijacking. Proper network security mechanisms are needed. Although
   there are some existing security mechanisms such as SEND, RA guard,
   secure DHCPv6 etc., they haven't been widely deployed and haven't
   been verified whether they are not bringing too much operational
   complexity and cost.

   Dynamic DNS update might bring risk of DoS attack to the DNS server.
   So along with the update authentication, session filtering/limitation
   might also be needed.

   The "make-before-break" approach of [RFC4192] requires the routers
   keep advertising the old prefixes for some time. But if the ISP
   changes the prefixes very frequently, the co-existence of old and new
   prefixes might cause potential risk to the enterprise routing
   system  since the old address relevant route path might already
   invalid and the routing system just doesn't know it. However,
   normally enterprise scenarios don't involve the extreme situation.

6. IANA Considerations

   This draft does not request any IANA action.
