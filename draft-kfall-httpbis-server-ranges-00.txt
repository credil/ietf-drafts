Abstract

This document clarifies the semantics associated with the Content-Range
HTTP header and associated Partial Content (206) response code.

It specifically allows a server to produce a Content-Range response
whose range is a subrange of the corresponding range requested using a
previous Range request. The HTTP protocol syntax is not modified.
Instead, this document clarifies that a server responding to a client
requesting a range (x-y) may respond with a range ((x+e)-(y-f)) for
nonzero integers e,f such that (x+e) < (y-f). In addition, it clarifies
the semantics of Request ranges which contain only a starting value.

1. Introduction

   The HTTP/1.1 specification [RFC2616] defines the concepts of range
   requests, partial GET requests, and partial range responses.  The
   definitions of these and other related concepts have been updated in
   [IDrange].

   As originally conceived, these concepts allow a client to selectively
   ask for, and receive, portions of an entity.  Quoting from [RFC2616],
   the intention is to "reduce unnecessary network usage by allowing
   partially-retrieved entities to be completed without transferring
   data already held by the client."

   We may consider this case to be "client-driven", in that the client
   is best positioned to know what it has received and what it still
   wishes to obtain.  Client-driven range requests become possible when

   a server indicates its support of range request processing using the
   Accept-Ranges header (Section 14.5 of [RFC2616]).  This header is
   used to indicate the type of unit the server is willing to process.
   Although various units could potentially be used, the only one
   defined for use with HTTP/1.1 and in common use is bytes.  Thus, we
   shall assume a range refers to a byte range, and the notation (a-b)
   indicates a range of bytes numbered a through b (inclusive).  The
   first byte of an entity is byte number zero.

   A client wishing to make a partial GET request (i.e., a range
   request) includes a Range header in its request (see Sections 9.3 and
   14.35 of [RFC2616]).

   This header may include one or more byte ranges.  Although a byte
   range may be expressed as (a-b), the value of b (called the last-
   byte-pos) may be omitted in a byte range when it is not known by the
   client.  In this case, or in a case where b is larger than or equal
   to the current length of the entity-body, the value of b is taken to
   be is equal to one less than the current length of the entity-body in
   bytes.

   A server which supports the Range header and receives an appropriate
   and satisfiable range request for an entity responds with status code
   of 206 (Partial Content) to indicate success (instead of status code
   206, which indicates OK).  In addition, the response must include
   either a Content-Range header or a multipart/byteranges Content-Type
   including Content-Range fields for each part included in the
   response.

   Multiple byte ranges will only be used if the corresponding request's
   Range header included multiple ranges.  The presence of multiple
   ranges in the request in effect indicates the client's ability to
   process the multipart/byteranges Content-Type.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

3. Server-Oriented Ranges

   When range requests and responses are used successfully, the server
   will typically respond to a byte range request with the contents of
   the entire byte range(s) included in the Range header.

   However, this behavior is not explicitly required by [RFC2616].
   Furthermore, there are interesting use cases where certain portions
   of an entity may not be available at a server at a particular point
   in time, but other portions of the same entity may be of immediate
   use to a requesting client.  Support for this case may be termed
   "server-driven," as the knowledge of which ranges are available at
   which times are determined more by the server than the client.

   Consider the simple network depicted in Figure 1.  The path between A
   and B is a conventional TCP/IP network and the path between B and C
   may be some other type of network (e.g., a lossy one directional link
   from C to B).

   Assume that a web proxy agent on B aggregates blocks of an entity
   together and provides the re-aggregated portions to A as soon as they
   become available.

   For concreteness, imagine the data being transferred are samples of
   continuous media such as streaming audio or video.  In this case it
   would be useful to allow A to obtain whatever continuous byte ranges
   are available on B in as timely a manner as possible.

   Using the existing framework for range requests, A can issue a
   partial GET request for the range (0-), indicating a desire to obtain
   whatever is available from B.

   B is able to respond with a byte range indicated using the Content-
   Range header in a Partial Content (status code 206) response.  It
   may, but is not require to, respond with a range of bytes starting
   with byte number zero.

   Continuing with the example, if A desires to obtain the missing parts
   of the entity it is interested in, it may issue multiple range
   requests of the form (a-b) and the server on B may respond with
   ranges corresponding ranges (x-y).  It is explicitly not required
   that a=x or b=y.  However, to be a legal byte range, a <= b and x &<=
   y are both required.

4. Summary

   This document specifies a normative behavior for range responses.
   When a partial GET request contains a range (x-y), a response
   utilizing the 206 response code MAY include a range other than (x-y).
   However, if the entire range is available it SHOULD respond with the
   requested range.

   In addition, when a range request is of the form (x-), the server MAY
   respond with a range response including an initial byte number y > x.
   Finally, a response including multiple ranges is permitted so long as
   the corresponding range request included multiple ranges.

   If the number of ranges available at the server are greater than or
   equal to the number of ranges present in the request, the server
   SHOULD respond with the number of ranges equal to the number of
   responses.

5. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security considerations beyond
   those present in [RFC2616].

6. IANA Considerations

   No IANA action is required by this document.

7. Conclusions

   The existing structure of HTTP range requests and partial responses
   can be used for delivering portions of a requested entity without
   syntactical modification to the HTTP protocol.
