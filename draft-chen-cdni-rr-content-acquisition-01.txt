Internet-Draft   Request Routing and Content Acquisition   December 2012


1.  Introduction

   The scope of CDNi work is described in [I-D.ietf-cdni-problem-
   statement]:

   - As illustrated in Figure 1, the acquisition of content between
   interconnected CDNs is out of scope of CDNi, which deserves some
   additional explanation.  The consequence of such a decision is that
   the CDNi problem space described in this document only focuses on
   defining the CDNi control plane; and the CDNi data plane (i.e., the
   acquisition and distribution of the actual content objects) is out of
   scope.

   It can be implied that the delivery process of the actual content
   objects requested by the end user from uCDN to dCDN is outside the
   scope of CDNi work.  However, in the cache miss case, i.e., the dCDN
   receives end user's request redirected by the uCDN and fails in
   locating the corresponding content in the cache, the dCDN needs to
   determine toward which uCDN it should initiate the content
   acquisition procedure.  And this should be included in scope of CDNi.

   This document illustrates the mechanism of request routing and
   content acquisition between uCDN and dCDN on the basis of Content
   Identification.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document reuses the terminology defined in:

   [I-D.draft-ietf-cdni-problem-statement-06],

   [I-D.draft-ietf-cdni-requirements-03],

   [I-D.draft-ietf-cdni-framework-00], and

   [I-D.draft-ietf-cdni-use-cases-08].


2.  Prerequisite

2.1.  CDN Interconnection Framework

   In the CDNi framework, the procedure of end user's content request to
   the uCDN and the content delivery from the dCDN involves two sub-

   procedures: Request Routing and Content Acquisition.  The method used
   in [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework] is that the CDN operators pre-agree for
   using 'distinguished' CDN-domains and embed them in URLs that end
   users request.  The example used is a CDN-domain peer-a.op-b.net that
   will be used as the target of redirections from uCDN to dCDN and a
   CDN-domain op-b-acq.op-a.net that will be used for inter-CDN
   acquisition of CSP's content from uCDN by dCDN.

   When the CDNi framework has even complex topology, i.e., in the case
   of cascaded CDNs, in order to record the redirection route of the
   request message, all the redirection routing information is required
   to be included in the URL, which would result in a very long URL.
   Limited by the length and format of URL, such approach would cause
   serious delay and waste of resources, and it would be difficult to
   implement this.  In addition, in the process of request message
   redirection, there is possibility that the URL is modified by a CDN
   which may lead to inaccuracy of the redirection and content
   acquisition information.

   This document introduces a content identification parameter called
   'UniContentID' to uniquely identify a content item, the details of
   which are illustrated in Section 2.2.  This document also makes use
   of a static configuration mechanism, i.e., every CDN provides a fixed
   URL or IP address for other CDNs to download content from.  This
   fixed URL or IP address is valid to all CDNs and all request messages
   sent to this address are considered as content downloading requests.
   By doing this, the change of request URL during multiple redirection
   processes can be avoided, and it would also accelerate the process of
   locating corresponding uCDN and the content item requested by the end
   user.  This method is easy to implement and can be used in cascaded
   CDNs scenario.

   Editor's Note: The mechanism for using dynamic mechanism to acquire
   the URL or IP address of uCDN for content downloading is FFS.

2.2.  UniContentID

   Given that the CDN needs to support the requirements for ingesting
   content to multi-screen for the same CMS (as described in ITU-T
   Y.1910 IPTV Functional Architecture), we need to define a two-tuple,
   i.e., the parameter of UniContentID to uniquely identify different
   CMSs.

   UniConentID is defined by a two-tuple as (ProviderID, ContentID),
   which uniquely identifies only one content item in the CDN.  Here the
   parameter ContentID denotes only one content item in a specific
   domain of a CMS.  The parameter ProviderID is defined as the provider
   for a specific domain and is only for a specific CMS in a specific
   domain.  We define the configuration table in the CDN which needs to
   be used in the request routing as follows:

   * CMSID: refers to the DNS name or IP address of the CMS.

   * Domain: refers to the different identifiers for IPTV service, PC
   service and mobile service etc.  For example, we define 0 for IPTV
   service, 1 for PC service, 2 for mobile service and 3 for other
   services reserved.

   * ProviderID: refers to the identifier of a content provider in a
   specific domain, which is unique in this configuration table.  For

Internet-Draft   Request Routing and Content Acquisition   December 2012


   the same parameter of CMSID, different parameter of Domain indicates
   different parameters of ProviderID.

   * ProviderType: refers to the provider type (B2B service or B2C
   service).  For example, we define 1 for B2B and 2 for B2C.

   * PlaybackURLprefix: refers to the prefix of the specific content
   service URL of the portal.  There is a one-to-one relationship
   between PlaybackURLpredix and ProviderID.  For example, if the URL is
   http://video.netitv.com/01234567890123456789012345678900?..., the
   PlaybackURLpredix is video.netitv.com.

   * ContentURLParseRule: refers to the resolution rules for the content
   item identified by the URL and ContentID in a regular way of
   expression.

     Figure 2 The Configuration Table

   Example 1: ProviderID matched by CMSID and Domain

   In the configuration table for IPTV service of a specific CMS, we set
   the ProviderID to iptv.netitv.com and CMSID to '10.17.45.233'.  Then
   one content is ingested to the CDN and the ContentID is
   '01234567890123456789012345678900'.  Domain is '0'.  The two tuple of
   UniContentID is
   ('iptv.netitv.com','01234567890123456789012345678900').

   In the website portal, the URL of the content serving is 'RTSP RR IP:
   PORT/ ContentID?CMSID=XXX &Domain=XXX...'.  When the streaming server
   receives the URL, it will analyse the ProviderID which is set to
   'iptv.netitv.com' by looking up the configuration table.  Then the
   two tuple UniContentID is('iptv.netitv.com',
   '01234567890123456789012345678900').  The content can be requested in
   the local cache if the cache hits or be relayed from the uCDN if the
   cache does not hit.

   Example 2: ProviderID matched for mobile service

   In the configuration table for mobile service of specific CMS, we set
   the ProviderID to mobile.netitv.com and the PlaybackURLPrefix to
   'mobile.netitv.com'.  Then one content is ingested to the CDN and the

   ContentID is '01234567890123456789012345678900'.  Domain is '2'.  The
   two tuple of UniContentID is ('mobile.netitv.com',
   '01234567890123456789012345678900').

   In the website portal, the URL of the content serving is 'RTSP://
   mobile.netitv.com/01234567890123456789012345678900?...'.  When the
   streaming server receives the URL, it will analyse the
   PlaybackURLprefix which is set to 'mobile.netitv.com' and find that
   the ProviderID is 'mobile.netitv.com' by looking up the configuration
   table.  Then the two tuple UniContentID is ('mobile.netitv.com', '
   01234567890123456789012345678900').  The content can be requested in
   the local cache if cache hits or be relayed from the uCDN if the
   cache does not hit.

   Example 3: ProviderID matched for PC service

   In the configuration table for mobile service of specific CMS, we set
   the ProviderID to pc.netitv.com and PlaybackURLPrefix
   to'video.netitv.com'.  Then one content is ingested to the CDN and
   the ContentID is '01234567890123456789012345678900'.  Domain is '1'.
   The two tuple of UniContentID is ('pc.netitv.com',
   '01234567890123456789012345678900').

   In the website portal, the URL of the content serving is 'http://
   video.netitv.com/01234567890123456789012345678900?...'.  When the
   streaming server receives the URL, it will analyses the
   PlaybackURLprefix which is set to 'video.netitv.com' and find that
   the ProviderID is 'pc.netitv.com' by looking up the configuration
   table.  Then the two tuple UniContentID is ('pc.netitv.com', '
   01234567890123456789012345678900').  The content can be requested in
   the local cache if cache hits or be relayed from the uCDN if the
   cache does not hit.

           Figure 3 Message Exchange for Request Routing

   1.  A Request Router of uCDN processes the RTSP or HTTP request and
   recognizes that the end-user is best served by another CDN.  It
   returns the IP address of dCDN.

   2. uCDN returns a 302 redirection message with a new URL including
   the IP address of dCDN.

   3.  The end-user then sends the request to the Request Router of dCDN
   (i.e. dCDN RR). dCDN RR returns the IP address of corresponding
   delivery node.

   4. dCDN RR returns a new URL including the IP address of dCDN DN.
   Note that, since the name of the delivery node was already obtained
   from dCDN (i.e. dCDN DN), there should not be any further redirection
   here.

   5.  The end-user requests the content from dCDN's delivery
   node,potentially resulting in a cache miss.  In the case of cache
   miss, the content needs to be acquired from uCDN (not the CSP), which
   is described in the following section.

         Figure 4 Message Exchange for Content Acquisition

   1.  The request router of dCDN processes the request from the end-
   user and forwards the request to the request router of mCDN.  Note
   that the dCDN needs to obtain the ProviderID information by looking
   up the configuration table.  The ProviderID and ContentID information
   can uniquely identify a content.

   2.  The request router of mCDN finds a cache miss case in the
   delivery nodes of mCDN.  It forwards the request to the request
   router of uCDN for the content.

   3.  The request router of uCDN finds that the content is cached in
   the delivery node of uCDN, then the delivery node of uCDN delivers
   the content to the delivery node of mCDN.

   4.  The delivery node of mCDN delivers the content to the delivery
   node of dCDN.

   5.  The delivery node of dCDN delivers the content to the end-user.

   Note: The content acquisition interface in step 3~5 needs to be
   standardized.
