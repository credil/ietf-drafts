Internet-Draft          Conex Destination Option              March 2012


1.  Introduction

   Conex [CAM] is a mechanism by which senders inform the network about
   the congestion encountered by packets earlier in the same flow.  This
   document specifies an IPv6 destination option [RFC2460] that can be
   used for performing conex markings in IPv6 datagrams.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Background

   The Conex working group came up with a list of requirements that had
   to be met by any marking mechanism.  It then considered several
   alternative mechanisms and evaluated their suitability for conex
   marking.  There were no mechanisms found that were completely
   suitable, but the only mechanism that came close to meeting the
   requirements was IPv6 destination options.  The analysis of the
   different alternatives can be found in [draft-krishnan-conex-ipv6].

4.  Requirements for marking IPv6 packets

   R-1: The marking mechanism needs to be visible to all conex-capable
   nodes on the path.

   R-2: The mechanism needs to be able to traverse nodes that do not
   understand the markings.  This is required to ensure that conex can
   be incrementally deployed over the Internet.

   R-3: The presence of the marking mechanism should not significantly
   alter the processing of the packet.  This is required to ensure that
   conex marked packets do not face any undue delays or drops due to a
   badly chosen mechanism.

   R-4: The markings should be immutable once set by the sender.  At the
   very least, any tampering should be detectable.

   Based on these requirements four solutions to implement the ConEx
   information in the IPv6 header have been investigated: Hop-by-Hop
   options, destination options, using header bits, and Option Headers.
   Only the use of Destination Option could fulfill the requirements.


5.  Conex Destination Option (CDO)

   The Conex Destination Option (CDO) is a destination option that can
   be included in IPv6 datagrams that are sent by conex-aware senders in
   order to inform conex-aware nodes on the path about the congestion
   encountered by packets earlier in the same flow.  The CDO has an
   alignment requirement of (none).

Internet-Draft          Conex Destination Option              March 2012


   Option Type

      8-bit identifier of the type of option. The option identifier
      for the conex destination option will be allocated by the IANA.

   Option Length

      8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option (excluding
      the Option Type and Option Length fields). This field MUST be
      set to the value 4.

   X Bit
      When this bit is set, the transport sender is using ConEx with
      this packet. If it is reset, the sender is not using ConEx with
      this packet.

   L Bit

      When this bit is set, the transport sender has experienced a loss.
      If it is reset, the sender has not experienced a loss.

   E Bit

      When this bit is set, the transport sender has experienced
      ECN-signaled congestion. If it is reset, the sender has not
      experienced ECN-signaled congestion.

   C Bit

      When this bit is set, the transport sender is building up
      congestion credit. Otherwise it is not.

   All packets of a ConEx-capable connection MUST carry the CDO.

   If the X bit is the zero all other three bits are undefined.  If the
   X bit is zero that means that the connection is ConEx-capable but
   this packet SHOULD NOT be accounted to determine ConEx information in
   an audit function.  This can be the case for e.g. pure control
   packets not carrying any user data.  As an example in TCP pure ACKs
   are usually not ECN-capable and TCP does not have an mechanism to
   announce the lost of a pure ACK to the sender.  Thus congestion
   information about the ACKs are not available at the sender.

   If the X bit is set, all three other bit (L, E, C) MAY be set.  When
   ever one of this bits is set, the number of bytes carried by this IP
   packet (incl.  IP header) SHOULD be accounted when determining
   congestion or credit information.  In IPv6 the length can easily be
   calculated by the value given in the Payload Length header field



Krishnan, et al.       Expires September 13, 2012               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          Conex Destination Option              March 2012


   (payload length + option space) plus a fixed value of 40 Bytes for
   the IP header itself.

   In principle all of these three bits (L, E, C) MAY be set in the same
   packet.  In this case the packet size MUST be accounted more than
   once for each respective ConEx information counter.  In many cases if
   congestion occurs the sender will not sent additional credit, but if
   e.g. a sender assumes losses because of an audit function or needs to
   maintain a certain sending rate to make an application layer service
   work, the occurrence of credit bits (c) in parallel to congestion
   exposure bit (L, E) is reasonable.

   If a network node extracts the ConEx information from a connection,
   this node is usually supposed to hold this information byte-wise,
   e.g. comparing the total number of bytes sent with the number of
   bytes sent with ConEx congestion mark (L, E) to determine the current
   whole path congestion level.  When equally sized packets can be
   assumed, the accounting of the number of packets (instead the number
   of bytes) should deliver the same result.  But a network node must be
   aware that this estimation can be quite wrong, if e.g. different
   sized packed are send, and thus is not reliable.


6.  Implementation in the fast path of ConEx-aware routers

   The conex information is being encoded into a destination option so
   that it does not impact forwarding performance in the non-conex-aware
   nodes on the path.  Since destination options are not usually
   processed by routers, the existence of the CDO does not affect the
   fast path processing of the datagram on non-conex-aware routers. i.e.
   They are not pushed into the slow path towards the control plane for
   exception processing.

   The conex-aware nodes still need to process the CDO without severely
   affecting forwarding.  For this to be possible, the conex-aware
   routers need to quickly ascertain the presence of the CDO and process
   the option if it is present.  To efficiently perform this, the CDO
   needs to be placed in a fairly deterministic location.  In order to
   facilitate forwarding on conex-aware routers, conex-aware senders who
   send IPv6 datagrams with the CDO MUST place the CDO as the first
   destination option in the destination options header.


7.  Compatiblility with use of IPsec

   In IPsec transport mode no action need to be taken as the CDO is
   visible to the network.  When accounting ConEx information the size
   of the Authentication Header (AH) SHOULD NOT be accounted as this

Internet-Draft          Conex Destination Option              March 2012


   information has been added later.  In the IPsec Tunnel model the CDO
   SHOULD be copied to the outer IP header as this information is end-
   to-end.  Only the payload of the outer IP header minus the AH SHOULD
   be accounted.


8.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Marcelo Bagnulo, Bob Briscoe, Ingemar
   Johansson, Joel Halpern, John Leslie and Wesley Eddy for the
   discussions that led to this document.


9.  Security Considerations

   This document does not bring up any new security issues.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new IPv6 destination option for carrying
   conex markings.  IANA is requested to assign a new destination option
   type in the Destination Options registry maintained at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-parameters <TBA1> Conex
   Destination Option [RFCXXXX] The act bits for this option need to be
   10 and the chg bit needs to be 0.
