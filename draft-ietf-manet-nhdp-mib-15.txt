                      draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-mib-15

Abstract

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it describes objects for configuring
   parameters of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) process on a
   router.  The MIB module defined in this document, denoted NHDP-MIB,
   also reports state, performance information and notifications about
   NHDP.  This additional state and performance information is useful to
   troubleshoot problems and performance issues during neighbor
   discovery.

Internet-Draft                The NHDP-MIB                     July 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it describes objects for configuring
   parameters of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) [RFC6130]
   process on a router.  The MIB module defined in this document,
   denoted NHDP-MIB, also reports state, performance information and
   notifications about NHDP.  This additional state and performance
   information is useful to troubleshoot problems and performance issues
   during neighbor discovery.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB module are defined using the mechanisms defined in
   the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This document
   specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is
   described in [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   [RFC6130] allows a router to discover and track topological
   information of routers up to two hops away by virtue of exchanging
   HELLO messages.  This information is useful for routers running
   various routing and multicast flooding protocols developed within the
   IETF MANET Working Group.

4.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Notification Objects - triggers and associated notification
      messages allowing for asynchronous tracking of pre-defined events
      on the managed router.



Herberg, et al.         Expires January 15, 2013                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                The NHDP-MIB                     July 2012


   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB module.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the NHDP instance in the router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      NHDP instance on the router and the overall discovery performance
      within the MANET.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the NHDP-MIB module.  The MIB
   module is arranged into the following structure:

   o  nhdpNotifications - objects defining NHDP-MIB notifications.

   o  nhdpObjects - defining objects within this MIB module.  The
      objects are arranged into the following groups:

      *  Configuration Group - defining objects related to the
         configuration of the NHDP instance on the router.

      *  State Group - defining objects which reflect the current state
         of the NHDP instance running on the router.

      *  Performance Group - defining objects which are useful to a
         management station when characterizing the performance of NHDP
         on the router and in the MANET.

   o  nhdpConformance - defining the minimal and maximal conformance
      requirements for implementations of this MIB module.

5.1.  Notifications

   This section describes the use of notifications, and mechanisms to
   enhance the ability to manage NHDP routing domains.

5.1.1.  Introduction

   Notifications can be emitted by a router running an instance of this
   specification as a reaction to a specific event.  This allows a
   network manager to efficiently determine the source of problems or
   significant changes of configuration or topology, instead of polling
   a possibly large number of routers.

Internet-Draft                The NHDP-MIB                     July 2012


5.1.2.  Notification Generation

   When an exception event occurs, the application notifies the local
   agent, which sends a notification to the appropriate SNMP management
   stations.  The message includes the notification type and may include
   a list of notification-specific variables.  Section 7 contains the
   notification definitions, which includes the variable lists.  At
   least one IP address of the router that originates the notification
   is included in the variable list so that the network manager may
   determine the source of the notification.

5.1.3.  Limiting Frequency of Notifications

   To limit the frequency of notifications, the following additional
   mechanisms are suggested, similar to those in [RFC4750]:

5.1.3.1.  Ignoring Initial Activity

   The majority of critical events occur when NHDP is first enabled on a
   router, at which time the symmetric neighbors and two-hop neighbors
   of the router are discovered.  During this initial period, a
   potential flood of notifications is unnecessary since the events are
   expected.  To avoid unnecessary notifications, a router SHOULD NOT
   originate expected notifications until a certain time interval has
   elapsed, which is to be predefined by the network manager.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that this time interval is at least 3 x
   'nhdpHelloInterval', so that symmetric neighbors are discovered.  The
   suppression window for notifications is started when the
   'nhdpIfStatus' transitions from its default value of 'false' to
   'true'

5.1.3.2.  Throttling Notifications

   The mechanism for throttling the notifications is the same as in
   [RFC4750] (i.e. the amount of transmitted notifications per time is
   bounded).

   Appropriate values for the window time and upper bound are to be
   selected by the network manager and depend on the deployment of the
   MANET.  If NHDP is deployed on a lossy, wireless medium, sending too
   many notifications in a short time interval may lead to collisions
   and dropped packets.  In particular, in dense deployments of routers
   running NHDP (i.e. where each router has many neighbors), a change of
   the local topology may trigger many notifications at the same time.
   [RFC4750] recommends "7 notifications with a window time of 10
   seconds" as the upper bound.  As NHDP is expected to be deployed in
   more lossy channels than OSPF, it is RECOMMENDED to choose a lower
   threshold for the number of notifications per time than that.



Herberg, et al.         Expires January 15, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                The NHDP-MIB                     July 2012


   Specifically it is RECOMMENDED to choose a threshold value for the
   objects reflecting the change be set to a value of '10' and have set
   the DEFAULT values for these objects within the Notifications Group
   to this value.  Further, a time window for the change objects is
   defined within this MIB module.  It is RECOMMENDED that if the number
   of occurrences exceeds the change threshold within the previous
   change window, then the notification is to be sent.  Furthermore, it
   is RECOMMENDED that the value for this window be set to at least 5
   times the 'nhdpHelloInterval'.

   The following objects are used to define the thresholds and time
   windows for specific Notifications defined in the NHDP-MIB module:
   'nhdpNbrStateChangeThreshold', 'nhdpNbrStateChangeWindow',
   'nhdp2HopNbrStateChangeThreshold', 'nhdp2HopNbrStateChangeWindow',
   'nhdpIfRxBadPacketThreshold', 'nhdpIfRxBadPacketWindow'.

5.1.3.3.  One Notification per Event

   Similar to the mechanism in [RFC4750], only one notification is sent
   per event.

5.2.  The Configuration Group

   The router running NHDP is configured with a set of controls.  The
   authoritative list of configuration controls within the NHDP-MIB
   module are found within the MIB module itself.  Generally, an attempt
   was made in developing the NHDP-MIB module to support all
   configuration objects defined in [RFC6130].  For all of the
   configuration parameters, the same constraints and default values of
   these parameters as defined in [RFC6130] are followed.  Refer to
   [RFC5148] for guidance on setting jitter related parameters, e.g.,
   nhdpMaxJitter.

5.3.  The State Group

   The State Group reports current state information of a router running
   NHDP.  The NHDP-MIB State Group tables were designed to contain the
   complete set of state information defined within the information
   bases specified in Section 6, Section 7 and Section 8 of [RFC6130].

   Two constructs, i.e., TEXTUAL CONVENTIONs, are defined to support of
   the tables in the State Group.  NHDP stores and indexes information
   through sets of (dynamically defined) addresses, i.e., address sets.
   Within SMIv2 it is not possible to index tables with variably defined
   address sets.  Hence, these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS are defined to
   provide a local mapping between NHDP managed address sets and SMIv2
   table indexing.  These constructs are the NeighborIfIndex and
   NeighborRouterIndex.  These are locally (to the router) defined,



Herberg, et al.         Expires January 15, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                The NHDP-MIB                     July 2012


   unique identifiers of virtual neighbors and neighbor interfaces.  Due
   to the nature of NHDP, the local router may have identified distinct
   address sets but is not able to associate these as a single
   interface.  Hence, two or more NeighborIfIndexes pointing to multiple
   distinct address sets may in fact be related to a common neighbor
   interface.  This ambiguity may also hold with respect to the
   assignment of the NeighborRouterIndex.  The local MIB agent is
   responsible for managing, aggregating and retiring the defined
   indexes, and in updating MIB tables using these indexes as the local
   router learns more about its neighbors' topology.  These constructs
   are used to define indexes to the appropriate State Group tables and
   to correlate table entries to address sets, virtual neighbor
   interfaces and virtual neighbors within the MANET.

5.4.  The Performance Group

   The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.
   Unstable neighbors or 2-hop neighbors and frequent changes of sets
   can have a negative influence on the performance of NHDP.  This MIB
   module defines several objects that can be polled in order to, e.g.,
   calculate histories or monitor frequencies of changes.  This may help
   the network administrator to determine unusual topology changes or
   other changes that affect stability and reliability of the MANET.
   One such framework is specified in [REPORT-MIB].

5.5.  Tables and Indexing

   The NHDP-MIB module contains a number of tables which record data
   related to:

   o  the local router,

   o  a local MANET interface on the router,

   o  other routers which are 1-hop removed from the local router,

   o  interfaces on other routers which are 1-hop removed from the local
      router, and

   o  other routers which are 2-hop removed from the local router.

   The NHDP-MIB module's tables are indexed via the following
   constructs:

   o  nhdpIfIndex - which is the IfIndex of the local router on which
      NHDP is enabled.





Herberg, et al.         Expires January 15, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                The NHDP-MIB                     July 2012


   o  nhdpDiscIfIndex - a locally managed index representing a known
      interface on a neighboring router.

   o  nhdpDiscRouterIndex - a locally managed index representing an ID
      of a known neighboring router.

   These tables and their indexing are:

   o  nhdpInterfaceTable - describes the configuration of the interfaces
      of this router.  This table has 'INDEX { nhdpIfIndex }'.

   o  nhdpLibLocalIfSetTable - records all network addresses which are
      defined as local interface network addresses on this router.  This
      table has 'INDEX { nhdpLibLocalIfSetIndex }'.

   o  nhdpLibRemovedIfAddrSetTable - records network addresses which
      were recently used as local interface network addresses on this
      router but have been removed.  This table has 'INDEX {
      nhdpLibRemovedIfAddrSetIndex }'.

   o  nhdpInterfaceStateTable - records state information related to
      specific interfaces of this router.  This table has 'INDEX {
      nhdpIfIndex }'.

   o  nhdpDiscIfSetTable - include the nhdpDiscRouterIndex of the
      discovered router, the nhdpDiscIfIndex of the discovered interface
      and the current set of addresses associated with this neighbor
      interface.  This table has 'INDEX { nhdpDiscIfSetIndex }'.

   o  nhdpIibLinkSetTable - foreach local interface, this table records
      all links belonging to other routers which are, or recently were,
      1-hop neighbors to this router.  This table has 'INDEX {
      nhdpIfIndex, nhdpDiscIfIndex }'.

   o  nhdpIib2HopSetTable - foreach local interface, this table records
      network addresses (one at a time) of symmetric 2-hop neighbors,
      and the symmetric links to symmetric 1-hop neighbors of this
      router through which these symmetric 2-hop neighbors can be
      reached.  This table has 'INDEX { nhdpIfIndex, nhdpDiscIfIndex,
      nhdpIib2HopSetIpAddressType, nhdpIib2HopSetIpAddress }'.

   o  nhdpNibNeighborSetTable - records all network addresses of each
      1-hop neighbor to this router.  This table has 'INDEX {
      nhdpDiscRouterIndex }'.

   o  nhdpNibLostNeighborSetTable - records network addresses of other
      routers which recently were symmetric 1-hop neighbors to this
      router, but which are now advertised as lost.  This table has

      'INDEX { nhdpDiscRouterIndex }'.

   o  nhdpInterfacePerfTable - records performance objects that are
      measured foreach local NHDP interface on this router.  This table
      has 'INDEX { nhdpIfIndex }'.

   o  nhdpDiscIfSetPerfTable - records performance objects that are
      measured foreach discovered interface of a neighbor of this
      router.  This table has 'INDEX { nhdpDiscIfIndex }'.

   o  nhdpDiscNeighborSetPerfTable - records performance objects that
      are measured for discovered neighbors of this router.  This table
      has 'INDEX { nhdpDiscRouterIndex }'.

   o  nhdpIib2HopSetPerfTable - records performance objects that are
      measured for discovered 2-hop neighbors of this router.  This
      table has 'INDEX { nhdpDiscRouterIndex }'.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This section specifies the relationship of the MIB module contained
   in this document to other standards, particularly to standards
   containing other MIB modules.  Definitions imported from other MIB
   modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in
   conjunction with the MIB module contained within this document are
   identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB module [RFC3418] is defined as
   being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity
   as a whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the
   management entity and certain other system-wide data.  The NHDP-MIB
   module does not duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to Routing Protocol MIB Modules Relying on the NHDP-
      MIB Module

   [RFC6130] allows routing protocols to rely on the neighborhood
   information that is discovered by means of HELLO message exchange.
   In order to allow for troubleshooting, fault isolation, and
   management of such routing protocols through a routing protocol MIB
   module, it may be desired to align the State Group tables of the
   NHDP-MIB module and the routing protocol MIB module.  This is
   accomplished through the definition of two TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS in the
   NHDP-MIB module: the NeighborIfIndex and the NeighborRouterIndex.
   These object types are used to develop indexes into common NHDP-MIB
   module and routing protocol State Group tables.  These objects are

   locally significant but should be locally common to the NHDP-MIB
   module and the routing protocol MIB module implemented on a common
   networked router.  This will allow for improved cross referencing of
   information across the two MIB modules.

6.3.  MIB Modules Required for IMPORTS

   The following NHDP-MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB
   [RFC2863], INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001], and FLOAT-TC-MIB [RFC6340].

-- Textual Conventions
--
   -- Two new Textual Conventions have been defined in
   -- this MIB module for indexing into the following
   -- tables and indexing into other tables in other MIB modules.
   -- This was necessary because NHDP manages and
   -- indexes based upon dynamic address tuples, i.e.,
   -- address sets, while SMI requires statically
   -- defined indexes for accessing its table rows.
   -- The NeighborIfIndex defines a unique (to the local router)
   -- index referencing a discovered virtual interface on another
   -- neighbor within the MANET. The NeighborRouterIndex defines a
   -- unique (to the local router) index referencing a discovered
   -- virtual neighbor within the MANET.
   --
   -- Due to the nature of NHDP,
   -- different indexes may be related to common neighbor
   -- interfaces or common neighbor routers, but the information
   -- obtained through NHDP has not allowed the local router
   -- to relate these virtual objects (i.e., interfaces or routers)
   -- at this point in time.  As more topology information
   -- is gathered by the local router, it may associate
   -- virtual interfaces or routers and collapse these
   -- indexes appropriately.

   -- Multiple addresses can be associated with a
   -- given NeighborIfIndex.  Each NeighborIfIndex is
   -- associated with a NeighborRouterIndex.  Throughout
   -- the nhdpStateObjGroup, the
   -- NeighborIfIndex and the NeighborRouterIndex are used
   -- to define the set of IpAddrs related to a virtual
   -- neighbor interface or virtual neighbor under discussion.

    DESCRIPTION
        "An arbitrary, locally unique identifier associated with a
        virtual interface of a discovered NHDP neighbor.
        Due to the nature of NHDP, the local router
        may not know if two distinct addresses belong to the
        same interface of a neighbor or to two different
        interfaces.  As the local router gains more
        knowledge of its neighbors, its local view may change and
        this table will be updated to reflect the local router's current
        understanding associating address sets to neighbor interfaces.
        The local router identifies a virtual neighbor interface through
        the receipt of address lists advertised through an
        NHDP HELLO message.

        All objects of type NeighborIfIndex are assigned by the agent
        out of a common number space.

        The value for each discovered virtual neighbor
        interface may not remain constant from
        one re-initialization of the entity's network management
        agent to the next re-initialization.  If the
        local router gains information associating two virtual
        interfaces on a neighbor as a common interface,
        then the agent MUST aggregate the two address sets to
        a single index chosen from the set of aggregated indexes,
        and it MUST update all tables in this
        MIB module which are indexed by indexes
        of type NeighborIfIndex.  It MAY then reuse freed
        index values following the next agent restart.

        The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP
        entity."

           1-hop symmetric link address set, designated
           through 'nhdpDiscIfIndex', and an expiration time.
           The 'nhdpIfIndex' in the INDEX is
           interface index of the local interface
           through which these 2-hop addresses are

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module defines objects for the configuration, monitoring and
   notification of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol [RFC6130].  NHDP
   allows routers to acquire topological information up to two hops away
   by virtue of exchanging HELLO messages.  The information acquired by
   NHDP may be used by routing protocols.  The neighborhood information,
   exchanged between routers using NHDP, serves these routing protocols
   as a baseline for calculating paths to all destinations in the MANET,
   relay set selection for network-wide transmissions etc.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  nhdpIfStatus - this writable object turns on or off the NHDP
      process for the specified interface.  If disabled, higher level
      protocol functions, e.g., routing, would fail causing network-wide
      disruptions.

   o  nhdpHelloInterval, nhdpHelloMinInterval, and nhdpRefreshInterval -
      these writable objects control the rate at which HELLO messages
      are sent on an interface.  If set at too high a rate, this could
      represent a form of DOS attack by overloading interface resources.

   o  nhdpHystAcceptQuality, nhdpHystRejectQuality, nhdpInitialQuality,
      nhdpInitialPending - these writable objects affect the perceived
      quality of the NHDP links and hence the overall stability of the
      network.  If improperly set, these settings could result in
      network-wide disruptions.

   o  nhdpInterfaceTable - this table contains writable objects that
      affect the overall performance and stability of the NHDP process.
      Failure of the NHDP process would result in network-wide failure.
      Particularly sensitive objects from this table are discussed in
      the previous list items.  This is the only table in the NHDP-MIB
      module with writable objects.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly

Internet-Draft                The NHDP-MIB                     July 2012


   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  nhdpDiscIfSetTable - The object contains information on discovered
      neighbors, specifically their IP address in the
      nhdpDiscIfSetIpAddr object.  This information provides an
      adversary broad information on the members of the MANET, located
      within this single table.  This information can be used to
      expedite attacks on the other members of the MANET without having
      to go through a laborious discovery process on their own.  This
      object is the index into the table, and has a MAX-ACCESS of 'not-
      accessible'.  However, this information can be exposed using SNMP
      operations.

   MANET technology is often deployed to support communications of
   emergency services or military tactical applications.  In these
   applications, it is imperative to maintain the proper operation of
   the communications network and to protect sensitive information
   related to its operation.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to provide
   support for the Transport Security Model (TSM) [RFC5591] in
   combination with TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410] ), including full support for
   authentication and confidentiality via the User-based Security Model
   (USM) [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
   Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security
   Model (TSM) [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as
   SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  Applicability Statement

   This document describes objects for configuring parameters of the
   Neighborhood Discovery Protocol [RFC6130] process on a router.  This
   MIB module, denoted NHDP-MIB, also reports state, performance
   information and notifications.  This sections provides some examples
   of how this MIB module can be used in MANET network deployments.  A
   complete discussion of MANET network management use cases and
   operational challenges is out of scope of this document, but will be
   integrated into a future document.

   NHDP is designed to allow routers to automatically discover and track
   routers one hop remote (denoted "neighbors"), and routers two hops
   remote (denoted "two-hop neighbors).  This information is used by
   other MANET protocols in operation on the router to perform routing,
   multicast forwarding and other functions with ad-hoc and mobile
   networks.  In the following, three scenarios are listed where this
   MIB module is useful:

   o  For a Parking Lot Initial Configuration Situation - it is common
      for the vehicles comprising the MANET being forward deployed at a
      remote location, e.g., the site of a natural disaster, to be off-
      loaded in a parking lot where an initial configuration of the
      networking devices is performed.  The configuration is loaded into
      the devices from a fixed location Network Operation Center (NOC)
      at the parking lot and the vehicles are stationary at the parking
      lot while the configuration changes are made.  Standards-based
      methods for configuration management from the co-located NOC are
      necessary for this deployment option.

   o  For Mobile vehicles with Low Bandwidth Satellite Link to a Fixed
      NOC - Here the vehicles carrying the MANET routers carry multiple
      wireless interfaces, one of which is a relatively low-bandwidth
      on-the-move satellite connection which interconnects a fix NOC to
      the nodes of the MANET.  Standards-based methods for monitoring
      and fault management from the fixed NOC are necessary for this
      deployment option.

   o  For Fixed NOC and Mobile Local Manager in Larger Vehicles - for
      larger vehicles, a hierarchical network management arrangement is
      useful.  Centralized network management is performed from a fixed
      NOC while local management is performed locally from within the
      vehicles.  Standards-based methods for configuration, monitoring
      and fault management are necessary for this deployment option.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a "manet" ifType from the IANA ifType-
   MIB.

   IANA is requested to assign a value for "xxxx" under the 'mib-2'
   subtree and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.
   When the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace
   "xxxx" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to
   remove this note.
