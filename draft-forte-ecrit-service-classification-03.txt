Abstract

   This document creates a registry for describing the types of services
   available at a specific location.  The registry is expected to be
   referenced by other protocols that need a common set of service terms

   as protocol constants.  In particular, we define location-based
   service as either a point at a specific geographic location (e.g.,
   bus stop) or a service covering a specific region (e.g., pizza
   delivery).

Internet-Draft           Service Classification             January 2009


1.  Introduction

   Many mobile devices are now equipped to determine the user's
   geographic location, either through GPS, cell-tower mapping or a
   network-based triangulation mechanism.  Once location information is
   available, it is natural to want to look up near-by places that
   provide a specific service, sometimes called points-of-interest
   (POI).  Examples of such services include restaurants, stores,
   hospitals, automatic teller machines and museums.

   To allow such systems to operate across large geographic areas and
   for multiple languages, it is useful to define a common set of terms,
   so that the same service is labeled with the same token regardless of
   who created a particular location service.  The number of different
   labels is clearly potentially very large, but only a relatively small
   subset of common services is of particular interest to mobile users,
   such as travelers and commuters.  This document focuses on labels
   commonly found on maps or in navigation devices.

   This document creates a registry of service labels and an initial set
   of values.  The registry is protocol-agnostic and should work for all
   protocols that can handle alphanumeric strings, including LoST
   [RFC5222].


2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Location-based services

   When not obvious, the definition of a particular service will be
   specified in the future.  In the following we enumerate a sub-set of
   the most common location-based services, some of which are also
   present in [RFC4589].

   The number of services that can be defined is very large.  New

Internet-Draft           Service Classification             January 2009


   services, however, SHOULD at least satisfy the following guidelines.

   - The service has to be of general interest;

   - It should not be specific to a particular country or region;

   - The language in which the new service is defined MUST be English
   (this is a protocol token, not meant to be shown to humans);

   - The newly defined services SHOULD correspond to a standard
   statistical classification of enterprises or services, such as the
   North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).


5.  IANA Considerations

   Registration template and URN scheme for emergency and non-emergency
   services have been defined in [RFC5031] in Sections 3 and 4,
   respectively.

5.1.  Registering new tokens

   This document creates new IANA registries for location-based services
   as listed in Section 3, starting with
   'urn:service:business.convention-center' and finishing with
   'urn:service:transportation.train-station'.

   Aside from the labels defined here, document
   [draft-ietf-ecrit-service-urn-policy] defines the registration policy
   for new service-identifying labels.

5.2.  Internationalization Considerations

   The service values listed in this document MUST NOT be presented to
   the user.  The values therefore have the characteristic of tokens or
   tags and no internationalization support is required.

5.3.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a registry for location-based services and as
   such does not raise security issues.  The same security
   considerations as in [RFC5031] apply.
