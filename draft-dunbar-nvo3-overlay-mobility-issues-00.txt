1. Introduction

   Overlay networks, such as VxLAN, NvGRE, etc, have been proposed to
   scale networks in Data Center with massive number of hosts as the
   result of server virtualization and business demand.
   Overlay network can hide the massive number of VMs' addresses from
   the switches/routers in the core (i.e. underlay network).
   One of the key requirements stated in [NVo3-problem] is the ability
   of moving VMs across wider range of locations, which could be

   multiple server racks, PODs, or locations, without changing VM's
   IP/MAC addresses. That means the association of VMs to their
   corresponding NVE is changing as VMs migrate. This dynamic nature of
   VM mobility in Data Center introduces new challenges and
   complications to overlay networks.
   This draft describes some of the issues introduced by VM migration in
   overlay environment. The purpose of the draft is to ensure those
   issues will be addressed by future solutions.

3. Issues associated with Multicast in Overlay Network

   Some data centers avoid the use of IP Multicast due, primarily, to
   the perceptions of configuration/protocol complexity and multicast
   scaling limits. There are also many data center operators for whom
   multicast is critical. Among the latter group, multicast is used for
   Internet Television (IPTV), market data, cluster load balancing,
   gaming, just to name a few.
   The use of multicast in overlay environment can impose some issues to
   network when VMs move, in particular:

Internet-Draft       Mobility Issues in Overlay            Nov 1, 2011


         The association between multicast members to NVE becomes
         dynamic as VMs move. At one moment, all members of a multicast
         group could be attached to one NVE. At another moment, some
         members of the multicast group could be attached to different
         NVEs.  Among VMs attached to one NVE, some can send, while
         others can only receive.
    In addition, Overlay, which hides the VM addresses, introduces the
    IGMP snooping issue in the core. With NVE adding outer header to
    data frames from VMs (i.e. applications), multicast addresses are
    hidden from the underlay networks, making switches in the underlay
    network not being able to snoop on the IGMP reports from multicast
    members.
    For unicast data frames, overlay network edge (e.g. TRILL edge) can
    learn the inner-outer address mapping by observing data frames
    passing by. Since multicast address is not placed in the inner-
    header's SA field of data frame, the learning approach for unicast
    won't work for multicast in overlay.
    TRILL solves the multicast inner-outer address learning issues by
    creating common multicast trees in the TRILL domain. If TRILL's
    multicast approach is used for DC with VM mobility, the multicast
    states maintained by switches/routers in the underlay network have
    to change as VMs move, which means switches in the underlay network
    have to be aware of VMs mobility and change multicast states
    accordingly.
    Overall, the VM mobility in overlay environment make multicast more
    complicated for switches/routers in the underlay network and for
    NVEs.


4. Issues associated with more than 4k Tenant Separation

   The [NVo3-framework] has a good figure showing the logical network
   seen by each tenant.  There are L2 domains being connected by L3
   infrastructure. Each tenant can have multiple virtual networks, which
   are identified IEEE802.1Q compliant 12 bits VLAN ID, under its
   logical routers (Rtr). Any VMs communicating with peers in different
   subnets, either within DC or outside DC, will have their L2 MAC
   address destined towards its local Router (Rtr in the figure below).

   For client traffic "VM-a" to "VM-b", the ingress NVE encapsulates the
   client payload with an outer header which includes at least egress
   NVE as DA, ingress NVE as SA, and a VNID. The VNID is a 24-bits
   identifier proposed by [NVo3-Problem] to separate tens of thousands
   of tenant virtual networks. When the egress NVE receives the data
   frame from its ports facing the underlay network, the egress NVE
   decapsulates the outer header and then forward the decapsulated data
   frame to the attached VMs.

   When "VM-b" is on the same subnet (or VLAN) as "VM-a" and located
   within the same data center, the corresponding egress NVE is usually
   on a virtual switch in a server, on a ToR switch, or on a blade
   switch.

   When "VM-b" is on a different subnet (or VLAN), the corresponding
   egress NVE should be next to (or located on) the logical Rtr (Figure
   1), which is most likely located on the data center gateway
   router(s).

4.1. Collision of local VLAN Identifiers when VMs Move

   Since the VMs attached to one NVE could belong to different virtual
   networks, the traffic under each NVE have to be identified by local
   network identifiers, which is usually VLAN if VMs are attached to NVE
   access ports via L2.

   To support tens of thousands of virtual networks, the local VID
   associated with client payload under each NVE has to be locally
   significant. If ingress NVE simply encapsulates an outer header to
   data frames received from VMs and forward the encapsulated data
   frames to egress NVE via underlay network, the egress NVE can't
   simply decapsulate the outer header and send the decapsulated data
   frames to attached VMs as done by TRILL. Egress NVE needs to convert
   the VID carried in the data frame to a local VID for the virtual
   network before forwarding the data frame to the VMs attached.

   In VPLS, operator has to configure the local VIDs under each PE to
   specific VPN instances. In VPLS, the local VID mapping to VPN
   instance ID doesn't change very much. In addition, most likely CE is
   not shared by multiple tenants, so the VIDs on one physical port of
   PE to CE are only for one tenant. For rare occasion of multiple
   tenants sharing one CE, the CE can convert the tuple [local customer
   VIDs & Tenant Access Port] to the VID designated by VPN operator for
   each VPN instance on the shared link between CE port and PE port. For
   example, in the figure below, the VIDs under CE#21 and the VIDs under
   CE#22 can be duplicated as long as the CEs can convert the local VIDs
   from their downstream links to the VIDs given by the VPN operators
   for the links between PE and CEs.

                          Figure 3: VPLS example


   When all VMs under one virtual network are moved away from a NVE, the
   local VID, which was designated for this virtual network, might need
   to be used for different virtual network whose VMs are moved in
   later.

   In the Figure below, the NVE#1 may have local VID #100~#200 assigned
   to some virtual networks attached. The NVE#2 may have local VID
   #100~#150 assigned to different virtual networks. With VNID encoded
   in the outer header of data frames, the traffic in the L3 Overlay
   Network is strictly separated.

   When some VMs associated with Virtual Network X using VID 120 under
   NVE1 are moved to NVE2, a new VID must be assigned for the Virtual
   Network X under NVE2.

   It gets complicated when the local VIDs are tagged by none-NVE
   devices, e.g. VMs themselves, blade server switches, or virtual
   switches within servers.

   The devices which add VID to untagged frames need to be informed of
   the local VID. If data frames from VMs already have VID encoded in
   data frames, then there has to be a mechanism to notify the first
   switch port facing the VMs to convert the VID encoded by the VMs to
   the local VID which is assigned for the virtual network under the new
   NVE. That means when a VM is moved to a new location, its immediate
   adjacent switch port has be informed of local VID to convert the VID
   encoded in the data frames from the VM.

   NVE will need the mapping between local VID and the VNID to be used
   to face L3 underlay network.

4.1.1. Local VIDs Managed by External Controller

   Most likely the VM assignment to a physical location is managed by a
   non-networking entity, e.g. VM Manager or a Server Manager.  NVEs may
   not be aware of VMs being added or deleted unless NVEs have a north
   bound interface to a controller which can communicate with VM/server
   Manager(s).

   When NVE can be informed of VMs being added/deleted and their
   associated tenant virtual networks via its controller, NVE should be
   able to get the specific VNID from its controller for untagged data
   frames arriving at its Virtual Access Points [VNo3-framework 3.1.1].

   Since local VIDs under each NVE are really locally significant, it
   might be less confusing to egress NVE if ingress NVE remove the local
   VID attached to the data frame. So that egress NVE always has to
   assign its own local VID to data frame before sending the
   decapsulated data frame to attached VMs.

   If, for whatever reason, it is necessary to have local VID in the
   data frames before encapsulating outer header of EgressNVE-DA/
   IngressNVE-SA /VNID, NVE should get the specific local VID from the
   external Controller for those untagged data frames coming to each
   Virtual Access Point.

   If the data frame is tagged before reaching the NVE's Virtual Access
   Point (e.g. tagged data frames from VMs) and NVE is more than one hop
   away from VMs, the first (virtual) port facing the VMs has be
   informed by the external controller of the new local VID to replace
   the VID encoded in the data frames. For reverse direction, i.e. data
   frames coming from core towards VMs, the first switching port facing
   VMs have to convert the VIDs encoded in the data frames to the VIDs
   used by VMs.

   The IEEE802.1Qbg's VDP protocol (Virtual Station Interface (VSI)
   discovery and configuration protocol) requires hypervisor to send VM
   profile upon a new VM is instantiated. However, not all hypervisors
   support this function.

4.1.2. Local VIDs Managed by NVE

   If NVEs don't have interface to any controllers which can be informed
   of VMs being added to or deleted from NVEs, then NVEs have to learn
   new VMs/VLANs being attached, figure out to which tenant virtual
   network those VMs/VLANs belong, and/or age out VMs/VLANs after a
   specified timer expires. Network management system has to assist NVEs
   in making the decision, even if the network management system doesn't
   have interface to VM/server managers.

   When NVE receives a data frame with a new VM address (e.g. MAC) in a
   tagged data frame from its Virtual Access Point, the new VM could be
   from an existing local virtual network, from a different virtual
   network (being brought in as the VM being added in), or from an
   illegal VM.

   Upon NVE learns a new VM being added, either by learning a new MAC
   address or a new VID, it needs its management system to confirm the
   validity of the new VID and/or new address. If the new address or VID
   is from invalid or illegal source, the data frame has to be dropped.



4.2. Tenant Virtual Network separation at the physical gateway routers

   When a VM communicates with peers in a different subnets, data frames
   will be sent to the tenant logical Router (Rtr1 or Rtr2 in the Figure
   1). Very often, the logical routers of all tenants in a data center
   are just logical entities (e.g. VRF) on the gateway router(s). That
   means that all the VLANs for all tenants will be terminated at the
   Data Center Gateway router(s), as shown in the figure below.

   Gateway routers can mitigate the overwhelming number of virtual
   network instances by integrating NVE function within the router(s).
   That requires routers to map VNID to VRF directly if routers'
   outbound to external network is VPN based. That requires routers to
   support tens of thousands of VRF instances, which can be challenging
   to routers.

   Data center can also use multiple gateway routers, with each handling
   a subset of tenants in data centers. That means that each tenant's
   VMs are only reachable by their designated routers or router ports.
   With the typical DC design shown in Figure 5, the number of server
   racks reachable by each gateway router is limited by the number of
   router ports enabled for the tenant virtual networks. That means the
   range of locations where each tenant's VMs can be moved across are
   limited.

   When VMs in data center communicates with external peers, data frames
   have to go through gateway. Even though majority of data centers have
   much more east west traffic volume than north south traffic volume,
   majority (as high as 90%) of applications (hosted on servers or VMs)
   in a data center still communicate with external peers. Just the
   volume of north south traffic is much less in many data centers.



5. Summary and Recommendations

   Overlay network can hide individual VMs addresses, making
   switches/routers in the core scalable. However overlay introduces
   other challenges, especially when VMs move across wide range of NVEs.
   This draft is to identify those issues introduced by mobility in
