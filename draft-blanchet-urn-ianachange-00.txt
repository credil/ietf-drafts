    Uniform Resource Names (URN) Formal Namespace IANA Registration
                  draft-blanchet-urn-ianachange-00.txt

Abstract

   Per RFC3406, Uniform Resource Names formal namespace identifier (NID)
   registration requires the publication of an RFC from the requestor.
   Experience shows that this requirement is too high.  This document
   updates the IANA registration policy for formal NID to Expert review.

1.  Introduction

   Per [RFC3406], Uniform Resource Names(URN) formal namespace
   identifier (NID) registration requires the publication of an RFC from
   the requestor.  Experience shows that this requirement is too high.
   This document updates the IANA registration policy for formal NID.

   This document only updates the registration policy of the formal
   namespace, as described in section 4.3 of [RFC3406].

2.  Formal Namespace Registration Policy

   This section replaces section 4.3 of [RFC3406].

   Formal NIDs are assigned by IANA through Expert Review, as defined in
   [RFC5226].

   The requested NID string must:

      not be an already-registered NID

      not start with "x-"

      not start with "urn-"

      not start with "XY-", where XY is any combination of 2 ASCII
      letters (see NOTE, below)

      be more than 2 letters long

   NOTE: ALL two-letter combinations, and two-letter combinations
   followed by "-" and any sequence of valid NID characters are reserved
   for potential use as countrycode-based NIDs for eventual national
   registrations of URN namespaces.  The definition and scoping of rules
   for allocation of responsibility for such namespaces is beyond the
   scope of this document.

3.  URN Namespace Definition Template

   To request a registration, the requestor fills out the template in
   Appendix A of [RFC3406] and send it to IANA.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the registration policy for URN formal
   namespaces.
