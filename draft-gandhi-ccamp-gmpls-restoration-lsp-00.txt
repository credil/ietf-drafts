         RSVP-TE Extensions For Signaling GMPLS Restoration LSP
              draft-gandhi-ccamp-gmpls-restoration-lsp-00


Abstract

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) RSVP-TE recovery
   signaling extensions are specified in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873]. In
   transport networks, there are requirements where GMPLS recovery
   scheme need to employ restoration LSP while keeping resources for the
   working and/ or protecting LSPs reserved in the network. Currently
   GMPLS recovery procedures do not address these requirements. This
   document proposes RSVP-TE extensions for GMPLS recovery with
   restoration LSP.

Internet-Draft   RSVP-TE Signaling for Restoration LSP  October 15, 2012


1.  Introduction

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extends MPLS to
   include support for different switching technologies [RFC3471]
   [RFC3473]. These switching technologies provide several protection
   schemes [RFC4426][RFC4427] (e.g. 1+1, 1:N and M:N). GMPLS RSVP-TE
   signaling has been extended to support various recovery schemes to
   establish Label Switched Paths (LSPs) [RFC4872][RFC4873], typically
   working LSP and protecting LSP. [RFC4427] Section 7 specifies various
   schemes for GMPLS restoration.

   In GMPLS recovery schemes currently considered, restoration LSP is
   signaled after the failure has been detected and notified on the
   working LSP. These schemes assume that working LSP is removed from
   the network before restoration LSP is signaled. In transport network,
   as working LSP are typically signaled over a nominal path, there are
   many scenarios where service providers would like to keep resources
   associated with the working LSP reserved. This is to make sure that
   the service (working LSP) can use the nominal path when the failure
   is repaired. Consequently, in transport networks one can employ a
   recovery scheme where a new restoration LSP is signaled while working
   LSP and/ or protecting LSP are not torn down in control plane due to
   a failure. Restoration LSP differs from a secondary LSP in the way
   that secondary LSP does not reserve resources in the data plane and
   is not able to carry any traffic until it is refreshed whereas
   restoration LSP does reserve resources and is able to carry traffic.

   One example of the recovery scheme considered in this draft is 1:R
   recovery. 1:R recovery is exemplified in Figure 1. In this example,
   working LSP on path A-B-C-Z is pre-established. Typically after a
   failure detection and notification on the working LSP, a second LSP
   on path A-H-I-J-Z is established as a restoration LSP. Unlike
   protection LSP, restoration LSP is signaled on as needed basis.


                        A --- B --- C --- Z
                         \               /
                           H --- I --- J


           Figure 1: An example of 1:R recovery scheme


   During failure, working LSP resources are not released and working
   and restoration LSPs coexist in the network. Nonetheless, working and
   restoration LSPs can share network resources. Typically when failure
   is recovered on the working LSP, restoration LSP is no longer
   required and torn down (e.g. revertive mode).

Internet-Draft   RSVP-TE Signaling for Restoration LSP  October 15, 2012


   Another example of the recovery scheme considered in this draft is
   1+1:R. In 1+1:R, a restoration LSP is signaled for the working LSP
   and/ or the protecting LSP after the failure has been detected and
   notified on the working LSP or the protecting LSP. The 1+1:R recovery
   is exemplified in Figure 2. In this example, working LSP on path A-B-
   C-Z and protecting LSP on path A-D-E-F-Z are pre-established. After a
   failure detection and notification on a working LSP or protecting
   LSP, a third LSP on path A-H-I-J-Z is established as a restoration
   LSP. The restoration LSP in this case provides protection against a
   second order failure. Restoration LSP is torn down when the failure
   on the working or protecting LSP is repaired.

                         \               /
                           H --- I --- J


           Figure 2: An example of 1+1:R recovery scheme


   [RFC4872] Section 14 defines PROTECTION object for GMPLS recovery
   signaling. The PROTECTION object is used to identify primary and
   secondary LSPs using S bit and protecting and working LSPs using P
   bit. However, the PROTECTION object does not have a way to identify
   restoration LSP or signal protection type for the type of recovery
   considered by this document. This document defines a new flag in the
   RSVP PROTECTION object [RFC4872] [RFC4873] to identify the GMPLS
   restoration LSP and new LSP flags to signal LSP protection types
   addressed by this draft.

3.  Signaling Extensions

3.1.  Signaling Procedure

   The PROTECTION object [RFC4873] [RFC4872] format has been defined as
   follows. A new bit named T bit is defined in this object to indicate
   GMPLS restoration LSP.


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |            Length             | Class-Num(37) |   C-Type(2)   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |S|P|N|O|T|Reserved | LSP Flags |     Reserved      | Link Flags|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |I|R|   Reserved    | Seg.Flags |           Reserved            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



   Restoration (T) : 1 bit

     When set to 1, this bit indicates that the request LSP is a
     restoration LSP. Working LSP is signaled with P bit set to 0 and T
     bit set to 0. Protecting LSP is signaled with P set to 1 and T bit
     set to 0.

     When a restore LSP is signaled due to a failed protecting LSP, P
     bit and T bit MUST be set to 1. When a restore LSP is signaled due
     to failed working LSP, P bit is set to 0 and T bit is set to 1.
     When T bit is set to 1 and S bit set 1 is permitted but usage is
     outside the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft   RSVP-TE Signaling for Restoration LSP  October 15, 2012


   LSP (Protection Type) Flags: 6 bits

     Indicates the desired end-to-end LSP protection type. Following new
     values are defined in this document in addition to the ones defined
     in [RFC4872].

       0x20 (TBD)   (Full) Rerouting with Restoration (1:R)
       0x21 (TBD)   1:N:R Protection with Extra-Traffic with Restoration
       0x22 (TBD)   1+1:R Unidirectional Protection with Restoration
       0x23 (TBD)   1+1:R Bidirectional Protection with Restoration


   The procedure for signaling all other fields in the PROTECTION object
   is specified in [RFC4872] and does not change other than specified in
   this section. As P bit and S bit are preserved when using restoration
   LSP, LSP protection types and LSP recovery procedures defined in
   [RFC4872] and [RFC4873] apply. Specifically, protection schemes
   defined in [RFC4872] namely 1+1 unidirectional protection, 1+1
   bidirectional protection, (full) LSP rerouting, 1:N protection with
   extra-traffic do not change with the introduction of the restoration
   LSP.

   A GMPLS recovery scheme "Rerouting without Extra-Traffic with
   Restoration LSP" is outside the scope of this document.

   When using a GMPLS recovery mode, where working or protecting LSP are
   destroyed, and restoration LSP assumes the role of a working LSP or a
   protecting LSP, restoration LSP RSVP Path message MUST be refreshed
   by clearing the T-bit in the PROTECTION object.


3.2.  Resource Sharing

   Resource sharing may be desired between working LSP and restoration
   LSP or protecting LSP and restoration LSP. Resource sharing is
   typically achieved using the make-before-break procedures defined in
   [RFC3209]. It may not be desired to share resources between a working
   LSP and a protecting LSP. ASSOCIATION object with association type
   "resource sharing" defined in [RFC4873] is used to identify LSPs that
   can share resources by matching ASSOCIATION objects in the LSPs. When
   ASSOCIATION object is signaled with association type "resource
   sharing", reservation style present in the LSP is ignored and for all
   matching LSPs with identical ASSOCIATION objects are requested to
   share resources. For LSPs with non matching ASSOCIATION object or
   absence of the ASSOCIATION object, reservation style [FF/SE] present
   in the LSP is used for resource sharing as per [RFC3209].

3.3.  Protection Switchover

   Specific use case of the restoration LSP with protection switchover
   is outside the scope of this document. Also, protecting switching co-
   ordination (PSC) [RFC6378] mechanism is outside the scope of this
   document.


3.4.  Compatibility

   The PROTECTION object has already been defined with class numbers in
   the form 11bbbbbb, which ensures compatibility with non-supporting
   nodes. Per [RFC2205], nodes not supporting this extension will ignore
   the object or the new T bit and LSP flag but forward it, unexamined
   and unmodified, in all messages resulting from this message.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to administer assignment of new values for
   namespace defined in this document and summarized in this section.

   Within the current document, one new flag is defined in the
   PROTECTION object.


     Value          Type
     -----          -----

     T bit (TBD)    Restoration LSP Type


   Within the current document, following new LSP flags are defined in
   the PROTECTION object.


     0x20 (TBD)     (Full) Rerouting with Restoration (1:R)
     0x21 (TBD)     1:N:R Protection with Extra-Traffic with Restoration
     0x22 (TBD)     1+1:R Unidirectional Protection with Restoration
     0x23 (TBD)     1+1:R Bidirectional Protection with Restoration

5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no additional security considerations. For a
   general discussion on MPLS and GMPLS related security issues, see the
   MPLS/GMPLS security framework [RFC5920]. In addition, the
   considerations specified in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873] will apply.
