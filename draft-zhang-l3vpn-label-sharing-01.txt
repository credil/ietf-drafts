                  Label Sharing for Fast PE Protection
                 draft-zhang-l3vpn-label-sharing-01.txt

Abstract

   This document describes a method to be used by Service Providers to
   provide fast protection of VPN connections for a CE. Egress PEs in a
   redundant group always assign the same label for VPN routes from a
   VRF. These egress PEs create a BGP virtual Next Hop (vNH) in the
   domain of the IP/MPLS backbone network as an agent of the CE router.
   Primary and backup tunnels terminated at the vNH are set up by the
   BGP/MPLS IP VPN based on IGP FRR. If the primary egress PE fails, the
   backup egress PEs can recognize the "shared" VPN route label, so that
   the failure affected traffic can be smoothly switched to the backup
   PE for delivery without changing its VPN route label.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Label Sharing for Fast PE Protection  October 21, 2013


1. Introduction

   For the sake of reliability, ISPs usually connect one CE to multiple
   PEs. When the primary egress PE fails, a backup egress PE continues
   to offer VPN connectivity to the CE. If local repair is performed by
   the upstream neighbor of the primary egress PE on the data path, it's
   possible to achieve a 50msec switchover.

   VPN routes learnt from CEs are distributed by egress PEs to ingress
   PEs that need to know these VPN routes. Egress PEs in a redundant
   group (RG) MUST allocate the same VPN route label for routes of the
   same VPN. When the primary egress PE fails, data packets are
   redirected to a backup egress PE by the PLR (Point of Local Repair)
   router, the backup PE can recognize the VPN route label in these data
   packets and deliver them correctly. The method developed in this
   document is so called "Label Sharing for Fast PE Protection".

   This document supposes BGP/MPLS IP VPN is deployed on the backbone
   and Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is used to distribute MPLS
   labels. Through generating virtual LSAs/LSPs in OSPF/ISIS, egress PEs
   in an RG create a virtual router (the vNH) in the domain of IP/MPLS
   backbone to represent the CE router. When the VPN route is
   distributed, those egress PEs use vNH as the "BGP next hop". The vNH
   will be treated as the egress point of the tunnel by other routers.
   Metrics for the virtual links attached to the vNH are set up in a way
   that the IGP FRR mechanism defined in [LFA] can be leveraged to
   achieve local protection when the PLR detects the primary egress PE
   fails.

   Figure 2.1: Egress PE routers share the same VPN route label 1100.

   A CE router is usually connected to multiple PE routers of the
   IP/MPLS backbone network for the sake of reliability. Figure 2.1
   shows such a scenario. In this document, PE1 and PE2 are defined as
   ingress routers and PE3 and PE4 are defined as egress routers.
   Suppose PE3 is the primary PE while PE4 is the backup egress PE.
   Those egress PE routers may discover each other as in the same RG
   from the CE routes learning process which can be a dynamic routing
   algorithm or a static routing configuration [RFC4364]. In this
   document, we suppose there are two PEs in one RG. It's possible to
   expand the method to support more than two PEs in one RG.

2.1. The Virtual Next Hop

   A vNH router is created in IGP to represent the set of CEs which are
   dual-homed to the same egress PEs in the Service Provider's backbone.
   A master PE is elected in the same way the DR is selected (see
   section 7.3 of [RFC2328]), or the DIS is selected [ISIS]. This master
   PE determines the loopback IP address for the vNH. This loopback IP
   address can be configured manually or assigned automatically. The
   SystemID of the vNH under ISIS is composed based on this loopback IP
   address. The master PE generates the router link state information
   (LSA/LSP) on behalf of the vNH. Links to each PE and each CE in the
   group are included in router link state information PDUs of the PE
   and CE.

   Multiple vNHs may be created for one CE. Then multiple tunnels can be
   set up from ingress PEs to the vNHs. Ingress PEs can choose from
   these tunnel routes to achieve load balance for the CE.

   The overload mode MUST be set so that the rest routers in the network
   will not route transit traffic through the vNH. In OSPF, the overload
   mode can be set up through setting the link weights from the vNH to

   egress PEs to the maximum link weight which is 0xFFFF. In ISIS, this
   overload mode is realized as setting the overload bit in the LSP of
   the vNH.

   See Appendix A and B for the detail setting up of LSAs/LSPs.

               Figure 2.2: The illustration of equations.

   LSP tunnels are set up based on IGP routes through LDP signaling. If
   the IGP costs for the links between egress PEs and the vNH can be set
   up in a way that one egress PE appears on the primary path while the
   other PE appears on the backup path, the PLR can make use of the
   multiple egress PEs to achieve fast failure protection. Link weights
   can be set up according to the following rule in order to leverage
   the well supported [LFA] as the IGP FRR mechanism. 

   1. This document supposes bidirectional link weights are being used.
   As illustrated in Figure 2.2, assume the weight for the link between
   PE3 and vNH is "M" and the weight for the link between PE4 and vNH is
   "S". The weight for the link between PE3 and PE4 is C34.

   2. Px is a neighbor of PE3. This Px will act as the PLR. Suppose Pxy
   is Px's neighbor with the shortest path to PE4, after PE3 is removed
   from the topology. The cost of this path is Sxy4.

   3. Add PE3 back to the topology. The cost of the path from Pxy to PE3
   is Sxy3.

   4. "M" and "S" can be set up as long as the following two equations
   hold.

                          eq1: Sxy4+S < Sxy3+M

                             eq2: C34+S > M

   The eq1 guarantees that Pxy is safe, i.e., no loop occurs, to be used
   as the next hop by the PLR for bypass. The eq2 is designed to insure
   that the primary path does not go through the primary egress PE and
   backup egress PE in series. 

   Although this document designs the method based on [LFA] which is
   widely deployed, other IGP FRR mechanisms can also be utilized to
   achieve the protection. For example, [MRT] is applicable regardless
   of how the link weights are set up.

2.3 Label Assignment and Processing

2.3.1. The VPN Route Label

   Egress PEs use BGP to distribute to ingress PEs the routes that they
   learn from CEs [RFC4364]. When egress PEs in an RG distribute the
   routes of the VPN that the CE is in, they MUST assign the same "VPN
   route label" for one VPN (per VRF label assignment). This label will
   become the first label of a data packet. The IP address of the vNH is
   used as the "BGP next hop". For example, in Figure 2.1, both PE3 and
   PE4 use 1100 as the VPN route label for the routes learnt from CE2. 

   The shared label may be manually configured or negotiated through
   signaling between egress PEs. [LS-ICCP] extends [ICCP] and defines
   application TLVs to achieve such kind of signaling. If global label
   is supported, egress PEs in the RG may use the global label as the
   shared label. For global label, see Section 3.2.2/[G-use] and [G-
   frame] for more information.

   Suppose PE3 fails and the packet with VPN route label 1100 is
   redirected to PE4. PE4 can recognize this shared label. It simply
   looks up the packet's destination address in the VRF identified by
   this label. As specified in Section 5 of [RFC4364], PE4 will be able
   to determine, the attachment circuit over which the packet should be
   transmitted (to the CE) as well as the data link layer header for
   that interface. In this way, the failed egress PE is smoothly
   protected.

   The handling of PE-CE link failure is out the scope of this document.
   When the PE-CE link on the primary path fails, the primary PE may
   resort to existing PE-CE protection mechanisms. It might require that
   the backup PE had advertised the route to CE using its own IP address
   as the BGP next hop. When this route is advertised, its preference
   should be turned down so that the route 'advertised' by the vNH
   always precedes.

2.3.2. The Tunnel Label

INTERNET-DRAFT    Label Sharing for Fast PE Protection  October 21, 2013


   In this document, all operations on the tunnel label are widely
   supported on existing PEs. Suppose Label Distribution Protocol is
   being used to distribute MPLS labels. The LSP tunnel follows an IGP
   route from ingress PEs to the vNH. The backup path to vNH can be
   calculated according to existing IGP FRR mechanism, such as [MRT] and
   [LFA].

   The ingress PE tunnels the data packet through the backbone network
   using the "tunnel label" as the second entry of the label stack. The
   "VPN route label" is not visible again until the MPLS packet reaches
   the egress PE. The egress PE pops the second label and deliver the
   packet according to the "VPN route label".

      It specifies the interface's MIB-II [RFC1213] ifIndex value. It
      ranges between 1 and the value of ifNumber. The ifNumber equals to
      the number of the PEs in the RG. The PE with the highest priority
      sorts the PEs according to their unsigned integer Router ID in the
      ascend order and assigns the ifIndex for each. 

   Type
      Value 1 is used, indicating the router link is a point-to-point
      connection to another router.

   In the Variable Length Field, each link outgoing from the vNH to an
   egress PE is depicted by a Type #22 Extended Intermediate System
   Neighbors TLV [RFC5305]. The egress PE is identified by the 6 octets
   SystemID plus one octet of all-zero pseudonode number. The 3 octets
   metric is set as that in Section 2.2. None sub-TLVs is used by this
   version, therefore the value of the one octet length of sub-TLVs is
   0. The Type #22 TLV requires 11 octets.

   The Type #22 TLV is also included in the LSP of each egress PE to
   depict the incoming link of the vNH. Only the 6 octets SystemID is
   replaced with the SystemID of the vNH.
