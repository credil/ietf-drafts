1. Introduction

   It is no longer uncommon for a data center to have thousands of
   server racks.  Those thousands of server racks could be connected by
   multiple groups of aggregation switches, with each group connecting
   hundreds of ToR switches. For servers supporting virtualization,
   there is typically a virtual switch embedded in each physical
   server.

   When TRILL is deployed in those data centers, there are issues no
   matter where the RBridge domain boundary starts. If RBridge domain
   boundary starts at aggregation switch level, the RBridge's IS-IS
   routing scales well, but there are problems with allowing only one
   (AF port) of multiple ports connected to a bridged LAN for
   forwarding traffic and requiring each RBridge edge to maintain a
   very large table of MAC&VLAN<-> RBridgeEdge mapping. If the RBridge
   domain boundary starts closer to hosts, e.g. at the virtual switches
   on servers, the number of MAC&VLAN<->Edge mapping is much smaller
   because each virtual switch only needs to maintain the mapping for
   remote hosts which actually communicate with the embedded VMs. But
   then, the number of nodes in RBridge IS-IS domain is very large,
   making it not scale well especially on aggregation switches which
   need to advertise link state over hundreds of ports.

   [RBridge-directory] introduces a method for RBridge edge to get
   MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping from a directory service in data
   center environment instead of flooding unknown DAs across TRILL
   domain. When directory is used, any node, even non-RBridge node, can
   perform the TRILL encapsulation. This draft is to demonstrate the
   benefits of non-RBridge nodes performing TRILL encapsulation.

3. Directory Assistance to Non-RBridge

   With directory assistance [RBridge-Directory], a non-RBridge can
   determine if a packet should be forwarded across the RBridge domain.
   Suppose the RBridge domain boundary starts at network switches (i.e.
   not virtual switches embedded on servers), a directory can assist
   Virtual Switches embedded on servers to encapsulate proper TRILL
   header by providing the information of the RBridge edge to which the
   target is attached.

   When a TRILL encapsulated data packet reaches an RBridge, the
   RBridge can simply forward the pre-encapsulated packet to the
   RBridge whose nickname is in the DA field of the TRILL header. By
   doing this, no ingress RBridge will receive a native frame with
   unknown DA, therefore, it won't need to flood received data packets
   to all other ports. That means there is no need to worry about AF
   ports and all RBridge edge ports connected to one bridged LAN can
   receive and forward pre-encapsulated traffic, which greatly improves
   the overall network utilization.

   ([RBridge] Section 4.6.2 Bullet 8 specifies that an RBridge port can
   be configured to accept TRILL encapsulated frames from a neighbor
   that is not an RBridge.)

   When data frames do not need to traverse RBridge domain, they are
   switched by all nodes/ports per IEEE802.1Q and RBridge edge will not
   encapsulate and forward native Ethernet frames across RBridge
   domain.

   When a pre-encapsulated TRILL frame arrives at an RBridge whose
   nickname matches with the destination nickname in the TRILL header,
   the processing is exactly same as normal, i.e. it decapsulates the
   native frame from the received TRILL frame and forwards the
   decapsulated Ethernet frame to the host attached to its edge ports.

   We call a node which only performs the TRILL encapsulation but
   doesn't participate in RBridge's IS-IS routing a ''TRILL
   Encapsulating node'' or ''Simplified RBridge''. The TRILL Encapsulating
   Node gets the MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping table pushed down or
   pulled from directory servers [RBridge-directory]. Upon receiving a
   native Ethernet frame, the TRILL Encapsulating Node checks the
   MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping table, and perform the corresponding
   TRILL encapsulation if the entry is found in the mapping table. If
   the destination address and VLAN of the received Ethernet frame
   doesn't exist in the mapping table, the Ethernet frame is forwarded
   per IEEE802.1Q.

4. Source Nickname in Frames Encapsulated by Non-RBridge Nodes

   The TRILL header includes a Source RBridge's Nickname (ingress) and
   Destination RBridge's Nickname (egress). When a TRILL header is
   added by a non-RBridge node, using the Ingress RBridge edge node's
   nickname in the source address field will make the ingress RBridge
   node receive TRILL frames with its own nickname in the frames'
   source address field, which can be confusing.

   To avoid confusion of edge RBridges receiving TRILL encapsulated
   frames with their own nickname in the frames' source address field
   from neighboring non-RBridge nodes, a new nickname can be given to
   an RBridge edge node, e.g. Phantom Nickname, to represent all the
   TRILL Encapsulating Nodes attached to the RBridge edge node.

   When the Phantom Nickname is used in the Source Address field of a
   TRILL frame, it is understood that the TRILL encapsulation is
   actually done by a non-RBridge node which is attached to an edge
   port of an RBridge Ingress node.

5. Conclusion and Recommendation

    As the number of hosts in data center gets large, the number of
    switches interconnecting them could increase to a point that TRILL
    no longer scales well. The situation will get worse as hypervisors
    on servers are equipped with virtual switches.  Therefore, we
    suggest TRILL consider directory assisted non-RBridge encapsulation
    approach. The non-RBridge encapsulation approach is especially
    useful when there are many servers in a data center equipped with
    hypervisor-based virtual switches because it is relatively easy for
    virtual switches, which are usually software based, to get directory
    assistance and perform network address encapsulation.
