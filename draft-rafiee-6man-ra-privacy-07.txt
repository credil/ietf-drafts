 Router Advertisement based privacy extension in IPv6 autoconfiguration
                  <draft-rafiee-6man-ra-privacy-07.txt>

Abstract

   The purpose of this document is to address the privacy issues that 
   exist within the Privacy Extension (RFC 44941) document so that the 
   Privacy Extension document can then be updated to correct these 
   shortcomings. These issues include the generation of public addresses 
   based on EUI-64, not choosing a good randomized function, not 
   changing the Interface ID (IID) when receiving a new router 
   advertisement, and some wording issues that might be ambiguous in 
   their interpretation.

INTERNET DRAFT         RA-base Privacy Extension       September 9, 2013



1.  Introduction 

   Today, privacy is an important concern to everyone in their everyday 
   life. Privacy is not bound to any particular layer in the Open 
   Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, but some layers do have a 
   greater impact on user privacy. This document tries to address the 
   deficiency that exists in the current privacy solution as it relates 
   to the network layer. In other words, how an IP address can affect 
   user privacy. The current solution for IPv6 autoconfiguration (RFC 
   4682) is the use of the Privacy Extension [RFC4941]. The Privacy 
   Extension document explains two different approaches that can be used 
   for IID generation. In the first approach, the use of stable storage 
   enables a node to find which IIDs are currently in use and which are 
   in reserve. In the second approach, where stable storage is not 
   available, it suggests the use of some randomizing approaches and 
   also comments about other available randomizing mechanisms such as 
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] or Dynamic Host 
   Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6). The Privacy Extension document also 
   refers to the use of a named approach as an approach to be used in a 
   mechanism for generating greater randomization. This document 
   addresses the following problems: 

   - RFC 4941 promotes the use of IIDs generated by a MAC address as a 
   public address for the node 

   - The node might not generate a new IID when it receives a new Router 
   Advertisement (RA) message if the option in the router advertisement 
   message tells the node to extend the lifetime of its address. If the 
   maximum lifetime of that address has not been reached, then the node 
   will keep its current IID without generating a new one. 

   - A node may determine a need for the use of a large, stable storage 
   area in which to store each newly generated IID. This needs to be 
   done to prevent the generation of another currently "in use" value. 
   When there is no stable storage available, the node may not be able 
   to make use of a greatly randomized IID because, according to section 
   3.2.2 of RFC 4941, there is nothing to force the use of RFC 4086. 

   

   The Updates pertain to the following sections and concepts in RFC 
   4941: 

   - Section 3.2.3: in order to explain the use of a new randomization 
   algorithm when stable storage is not available, and when implementers 
   are not willing to use RFC 4086. This algorithm can provide the same 
   randomization as does CGA. 

   - An additional update to this RFC will explain how to maintain the 
   lifetime of the IP address when the router prefix changes or the 
   lifetime of the IID, in general, changes. This is needed because, in 


Rafiee, et al.        Expires March 9, 2014                     [Page 3]

INTERNET DRAFT         RA-base Privacy Extension       September 9, 2013

   this RFC, the lifetime of the IID plays a key role. This means that 
   the node might not change its IID when it moves to another network 
   unless the node is rebooted. This can afford an attacker the ability 
   to track this node, and in doing so, to obtain enough confidential 
   information about this node to assist in further attacks. 

   - Step 4, Section 3.2.1: update to clarify which IIDs should be kept 
   in stable storage. 

   If there is no stable storage available, and if none of the methods 
   explained in RFC 4086 [RFC4086] for randomization are used, then it 
   is possible for the node to make a bad choice of what approach to use 
   for the randomization process, and, thus, may not be able to make use 
   of a good randomized IID. This is due to the fact that, in section 
   3.2.2 of RFC 4941, the word "might" is used in explaining the proper 
   randomization approach to be used. The approach should be specified. 



2.  Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation 
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be 
   interpreted as carrying RFC 2119 significance. 

   In this document the use of || indicates the concatenation of the 
   values on either side of the sign. 



3.  Algorithm Overview 

   This section explains how to make use of a new algorithm that will 
   provide for a higher randomization of the IID without the need for 
   stable storage. This section is to address the other randomization 
   approach by using DHCPv6 or CGA. Instead one can use this algorithm. 
   This approach is RECOMMENDED, and preferable over the first approach 
   where stable storage is needed, because this approach is easier to 
   use than the stable storage approach. In the case where the node 
   wants to use stable storage, this algorithm can be used for the first 
   time generation of the iIID which can then be used to populate the 
   history value. 

   1. Generate a 16 byte random number called modifier. To generate this 
   modifier, implementations SHOULD use a random seed to aid in the 
   randomization of this number. 

   2. Obtain the router prefix from the Router Advertisement message 



Rafiee, et al.        Expires March 9, 2014                     [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT         RA-base Privacy Extension       September 9, 2013

   3. Obtain the nodes' current time and convert it to a 100 nanoseconds 
   (10^-7 seconds) and call it timestamp. This field consists of a 
   64-bit, unsigned integer containing a the number of 100 nano seconds 
   since January 1, 1970, 00:00 UTC, by using a fixed point format. 

   4. Concatenate the modifier with the timestamp and the router prefix. 

   R1=(modifier(16 bytes)||timestamp(8 bytes)|| router prefix) 

   5. Execute SHA2 (256) against the result from step 4. 

   digest=SHA256(R1) 

   The use of SHA2 (256) is RECOMMENDED because the chances of finding a 
   collision are less than when using SHA1 and the generation time is 
   acceptable (in microseconds using a standard CPU). In the future, if 
   a faster and collision free algorithm becomes available, then it 
   SHOULD be used. It is RECOMMENDED that the implementation be able to 
   support any new algorithms. 

   6. Take the 64 leftmost bits from the resulting output of step 5 
   (SHA2 digest). Bits u and g do not have any special meaning as in 
   [ugbits]. 

   7. Concatenate the IID with the local subnet prefix in order to set 
   the local IP address. If the lifetime of the old local address has 
   not expired, then the node MIGHT skip this step. Otherwise it will 
   receive a new router prefix. 

   8. Concatenate the IID with the router subnet prefix (Global subnet 
   prefix), obtained from the RA message, and set it as a tentative 
   privacy IP address. This IP address will become permanent after 
   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) processing. This constitutes 
   another update to RFC 4941. The status of the IP addresses defined in 
   RFC 4941 are temporary, while they SHOULD be permanent with a 
   lifetime as explained in section 4. 



3.1.  Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) Process 

   After the DAD process has completed, if the node finds collisions in 
   the network, then the modifier will be incremented and the DAD 
   process will be repeated. If, after 3 tries, it receives the same 
   result, it will consider this an attack and will start using that IP 
   address. 



4.  Modification for the use of stable storage 

   The stable storage (section 3.2.1 RFC 4941) MUST only contain the 
   last value generated by the node. The node MUST not keep older, 


Rafiee, et al.        Expires March 9, 2014                     [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT         RA-base Privacy Extension       September 9, 2013

   already used, IIDs. This modification is made to eliminate the need 
   for large stable storage. For the randomization approach, if the node 
   cannot pick the best algorithm from among the ones already explained 
   in RFC 4086, then it MUST also include a timestamp (the same meaning 
   as used in this document) in order to preclude the generation of an 
   already used IID. 



5.  Interface ID (IID) generation based on the MAC address 

   Step 3 in Section 3.3 of RFC 4941 MUST be ignored. When a node uses 
   the mechanism explained in this document to generate an IID, it MUST 
   not use any other IID generation approaches that are based on MAC 
   addresses ( RFC 4862) for either temporary or non temporary IID 
   generation. It is RECOMMENDED that the node use the algorithm 
   explained in [StableAddresses] for the generation of a public address 
   that does not make use of EUI-64 or the MAC address for public 
   (global) addresses. 

   The choice of whether or not to list a node's address in the DNS, 
   undisguised, depends on many factors, including the set of 
   applications to be run on the host. Not listing a node's address in 
   the public DNS may afford the node greater privacy, but, at the same 
   time, it may also impair its ability to support certain applications. 
   



6.  Lifetime of Interface ID (IID) 

   The node MIGHT make use of the same algorithm and the same lifetime 
   as is explained in RFC 4941, or the node MIGHT choose a lifetime 
   based on some other algorithms or policies. If it uses the lifetime 
   explained in RFC 4941, then it SHOULD generate a new IID whenever it 
   receives a new router prefix, regardless of the option in the Router 
   Advertisement message to extend this lifetime. 



7.  Threat Analysis 

   By updating RFC 4941, a node will be able to prevent many attacks on 
   users' privacy. A list of these attacks are explained in 
   [privacyConsideration]. 

8.  Security Considerations

   As is explained in the Privacy Extension document. the same 
   approaches are used to maintain security, such as using Secure 
   Neighbor Discovery (SeND)(RFC 3971) or using a monitoring system 
   which would inform the administrator of the status of the network and 
   of any suspended activities in the network.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document is updating RFC 4941 in order to prevent nodes from 
   using addresses that were generated based on a MAC address and also 
   some of the other deficiencies that exist in RFC 4941 



10.  Conclusions

   Privacy has become a very important issue in recent years. There is 
   one solution to privacy issues, but the current solution is deficient 
   in some respects. The purpose of this current document is to address 
   and solve the problem which exists with the Privacy Extension 
   document [RFC4941].
