    <abstract>
      <t>Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring SMTP clients can be identified by an
        authenticated domain. Unfortunately many hope to use DKIM as an alternative, but it is
        independent of intended recipients and domains accountable for sending the message. This
        means DKIM is poorly suited for establishing abuse assessments for unsolicited messaging of
        commercial email otherwise known as SPAM, nor was this initially DKIM's intent. DKIM lacks
        message context essential to ensure fair assessment and to ensure this assessment is not
        poisoned (Who initiated the transaction and to whom).</t>
      <t>DKIM was instead intended to establish increased levels of trust based upon valid DKIM
        signatures controlling acceptance and what a user sees within the FROM header field. But
        DKIM failed to guard against pre-pended header fields where any acceptance based on valid
        DKIM signatures is sure to exclude header field spoofing, especially that of the FROM. This
        weakness allows malefactors to exploit DKIM signature acceptance established by high-volume
        DKIM domains to spoof ANY other domain, even when prohibited within the Signer's
        network.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Currently, IPv4 address reputation provides the primary basis for defending open SMTP
        services (acceptance without prior arrangement). Use of IP addresses in this role completely
        breaks down when dealing with IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"/> due to data requirements and an
        inability to defend detection of subscription violations. There are currently
        18,209,237,415,985,168 /64 equivalent IPv6 prefixes routed. <xref target="v6-BGP-Rpts"/>. In
        comparison, for IPv4 there are 2,614,654,096 IP addresses routed. While IPv4 is reaching its
        maximum, IPv6 has about 0.1% of the available /64 prefix routed and this continues to grow
        rapidly. Unlike IPv4, there is no practical means to scan reverse DNS namespace within IPv6
        since each /64 prefix may contain any number of PTR records ranging up to
        184,000,000,000,000,000,000.</t>
      <t>A technique commonly employed to automate IPv4 address categorization of suitable hosts is
        to check whether reverse PTR records appear to represent valid hostnames. Those that
        represent 4 decimal numbers are often considered unacceptable, for example. Our processing
        of reverse DNS namespace in cooperation with network providers now excludes about 38%, or
        about 1,000,000,000 IPv4 addresses. Comparing IPv6 /64 prefixes with the remainder of
        routable IPv4 addresses shows there are 11.3 million times more IPv6 /64 prefixes needing
        categorization. In addition, there is no practical means to facilitate this effort.</t>
      <t>IP address reputation requires logging associated connections to permit review. Whether
        describing reputations as only positive or only negative, errant exclusion or inclusion of
        either poses similar risk. Tracking currently routed IPv6 /64 prefixes using a single bit
        requires 6 million billion bytes or 5,650 Terra-bytes just to track simple use. Even
        feedback by IPv6 address prefix will expose mailboxes that detect subscription policy
        violations.</t>
      <t>Some also suggest there will not be a significant increase in the number of servers running
        over IPv6 and since their overall number should be comparable, email should still be dealing
        with a similar number of IP addresses. Unlike IPv4, IPv6 does not constrain the number of IP
        addresses assigned to a network interface. This feature allows each connection from a server
        to originate from a different IP address, perhaps one for each user. The potential increase
        allowed by IPv6 may prove explosive, even those only from good actors.</t>
      <t>Organizations such as M3AAWG hope to use DKIM as a required acceptance requirement to
        better ensure a domain identity offers a basis for acceptance to replace that of the IP
        address used by SMTP clients. Due to the understandable IPv6 reputation services' inability
        to scale, domain based alternatives are being sought. Some at least understand DKIM is
        unable to support negative reputation schemes. Reliance on a mechanism unable to sustain
        close scrutiny of negative assertions makes sustained differentiation of positive and
        negative views less tenable.</t>
      <t>At this April's Rocky Mountain IPv6 Task Force summit in Denver, the second day government
        track sessions raised concerns about there being no means available to defend SMTP over
        IPv6. There are proposals within the IETF aimed at establishing DKIM as a basis for
        reputation schemes in the Repute WG (i.e. section 3.2 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-repute-email-identifiers"/> which introduces DKIM domains being used
        along with SMTP client IP addresses and rfc5321.helo also identifying the SMTP client.
        Identifying the SMTP client encompasses both "Who Initiated" and "To Whom" message elements
        to support fair negative assertions. However, DKIM does not encompass this essential
        information. In addition, DKIM's inability to detect invalid prefixed header fields also
        means any positive DKIM reputation assertion can prove highly harmful by increasing trust in
        possible deceptions.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Maintaining Trust">
      <t>Not every subsystem or protocol layer should be expected to repeat previous security checks
        to establish proper layering, however critical checks important for enforcing new
        relationships within a message should not be assumed, especially those involving a trivial
        effort. With high levels of abuse resulting from email's open nature, delegating checks in a
        structured manner better conserves essential resources. However, email's highly distributed
        store and forward protocol could not function if rigid message structures were enforced by
        the transport. Such enforcement does not scale, and may impede necessary change. New
        authentication or presentation requirements may involve small structural adjustments. For
        example, internationalization introduced a format negotiation not assured to survive beyond
        the next hop.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Responding to Defects and Exploitation">
      <t>As with aviation, the success of email has risen to great heights. As within the world of
        aviation, faults threatening security, that when discovered, demand our attention and
        diligence to effect repair. Email has become an integral component in general commerce and
        the maintenance of security such as reporting system failures, break-in attempts, and
        facilitating account access recovery.</t>
      <t>Reporting or predicting failure should not be viewed as exhibiting a lack of respect for
        achieved accomplishments. Noting and repairing faults only signify the importance of email's
        prominent role. As with most security related protocols, responding to noted defects is
        fairly common. Not responding to discovered defects in a security related protocol would be
        shocking. Simply publishing this draft appears to have already increase the level of
        multiple FROM header field abuse seen where it is now at 21% of signed DKIM messages.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Conflating DKIM Fragments with Email Messages">
      <t>DKIM signs only fragments of an email message, so it is more proper to refer to "DKIM
        Signed Fragments", and not "DKIM Signed Messages". Normal DKIM signature validation offers a
        simple PASS/FAIL associating it with a specific domain. When a recipient receives a PASS
        status, only the last FROM header field message fragment is ensured to have been included in
        the DKIM signature process. Other message fragments, including the message body, are
        optional and may not have been included. The FROM header field is normally visible UNLESS
        there are multiple FROM header fields. In which case, the signed FROM header field fragment
        is likely invisible, as is the DKIM signature fragments that hide which other message
        fragments had been encompassed by the DKIM signature process.</t>
      <t>DKIM's trust related role is to better ensure message delivery to a user's in-box. Unless
        DKIM ensures this trust is not used to perpetrate deception, no positive assertions
        regarding a DKIM domain is safe. As a result, DKIM can not be used with either positive or
        negative reputation assertions in its current form.</t>
      <t>The FROM header field is the Author identifier in section 11.1 of <xref
          target="I-D.kucherawy-dmarc-base"/>. The DMARC specification offers normative language
        that a message SHOULD be rejected when multiple FROM header fields are detected. This
        requirement would not be necessary or impose protocol layer violations if DKIM did not offer
        valid signature results when repeated header fields violate <xref target="RFC5322"/>. <xref
          target="RFC5322"/> declaring a message structure invalid does not preclude the occurrence
        of invalid messages, and <xref target="RFC5321"/> clearly states it will not enforce <xref
          target="RFC5322"/> message structure due to practical constraints. Instead of relying on
        optional policies such as DMARC that make partial guesses that ignore DATE or SUBJECT
        spoofing for example, critical violations of the message structure that pertain to enhancing
        trust can be enforced by DKIM simply defining the associated signatures invalid. Unlike
        DMARC, proper signature definition does not cross protocol layers, especially since no other
        layer enforces <xref target="RFC5322"/>.</t>
      <t>Since multiple DKIM signatures can occur, simple annotation of which fragments and domains
        associate with a valid signature is precluded. The ONLY message fragment ensured by a DKIM
        signature is the FROM header field. Just as DMARC concluded only the FROM header field is
        closely observed by recipients, DKIM initially reached this conclusion as well. While no
        absolute assurance of header field validity is asserted, the domain together with it's
        reputation permits recipients to increase their trust in what is observed in the FROM header
        field. This trust further increases when the DKIM domain is authoritative for the FROM
        header field domain.</t>
      <t>When acceptance is predicated on the DKIM signature, as occurs with DMARC, preserving trust
        associated with the FROM header field in conjunction with the DKIM domain is destroyed
        whenever multiple FROM header fields are permitted by not invalidating these DKIM
        signatures. DMARC over reaches when rejecting email based upon message format as with <xref
          target="RFC6854"/> group syntax in the FROM header field. DMARC should not be required to
        second guess whether a DKIM signature is valid.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="SMTP Can't">
      <t>SMTP <xref target="RFC5321"/> recommends against rejecting messages based upon perceived
        defects in the message structure. This liberal acceptance permits evolutionary change in
        message specifications starting at <xref target="RFC0822"/> that was based on <xref
          target="RFC0733"/> replaced by <xref target="RFC2822"/> and again by <xref
          target="RFC5322"/>, <xref target="RFC6152"/>, <xref target="RFC6532"/>, and <xref
          target="RFC6854"/>; the second to last paragraph in section 3 of <xref target="RFC5321"/>
        provides a definitive statement messages should not be rejected due to perceived defects in
        the <xref target="RFC0822"/> message structure. The initial reference to <xref
          target="RFC0822"/> in this paragraph offers two foot notes with the second referencing the
        latest version of <xref target="RFC0822"/> which is <xref target="RFC5322"/> which itself
        has recently been updated. The impact of initially removing text specifically indicating
        which header fields are not to repeat is unknown. This information was implied within the
        then-new ABNF notation. Clarifying text for this requirement did not return until the <xref
          target="RFC0822"/> revision 19 years later which also indicates this specification's
        success at providing a foundation that allowed email to flourish.</t>
      <t>There are many SMTP servers that have been in operation for decades with years passing
        between security patches. Such an accomplishment is most remarkable considering the volume
        of traffic being handled, often from highly malicious sources. This amazing stability and
        scalability with high levels of security would not have been possible if SMTP had been
        expected to validate message formats.</t>
      <t>Expecting SMTP to validate message formats to protect against vulnerabilities pertaining to
        protocols such as DKIM does not scale. The general use of DKIM permits signature checks
        subsequent to acceptance where only the status of signatures determines internal placement.
        As such, it becomes critical to ensure a DKIM signature is never declared valid having
        malformed header field stacks. To accomplish this, the DKIM specification must change.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="DKIM Vulnerability">
      <t>DKIM permits a vulnerability by not checking the message header field stack for invalid
        repeats when signing or verifying a signature. The DKIM signature process must walk both
        down and then up the header field stack while selecting the header fields to be included in
        the hash process of the signature. The DKIM process will even ignore prefixed FROM header
        fields which is the only header field always included.</t>
      <t>The WG concluded that "listing non-existent header fields as signed" hack added in
        non-normative language together with opinions that checking for invalid repeated header
        fields is not to be considered DKIM's problem. See section 8.15 of <xref target="RFC6376"/>
        where this issue was expressed as not an attack against the trust DKIM intends to convey,
        and thus not a concern for DKIM. Nevertheless, improperly formed messages may display only
        the first of multiple header fields that, as a result of erroneous assumptions of there
        being no invalid repeated header fields, the prefixed header fields are likely to be
        displayed in lieu of those signed while not impacting DKIM's signature validity.</t>
      <t>DKIM incorrectly assumed the header field stack's starting condition, which DKIM itself is
        best able to determine, and is an option in the OpenDKIM implementation. This is likely to
        astonish most recipients that DKIM failed to make a robust effort to maintain the trust it
        is attempting to convey. Three members of the WG authored proposed changes aimed
        specifically at addressing this issue <xref target="DKIM-MH-Attack"/>. At the time, some
        expressed concerns about whether this might set back DKIM's standardization process. As
        such, DKIM Signers may sign malformed messages (e.g., violate <xref target="RFC5322"/>) and
        be in compliance with DKIM specifications. In addition, receivers may verify these messages
        as having valid signatures despite multiple instances of a header field only permitted to
        occur once and also be in compliance with DKIM specifications. See addendum for examples of
        the possible abuse permitted.</t>
      <t>Use of DKIM on such messages exposes a vulnerability in the evaluation process. Rather than
        ensuring essential checks are made prior to producing a result, a wasteful hack was later
        suggested where extra non-existent header fields could be included in the list of signed
        header fields. Any pre-pended header field added after signing would thereby change
        resulting hashes and invalidate the signature. Not all domains are attempting to achieve the
        same level of trust and may be more sensitive to incurring incremental storage requirements.
        Some domains may even inadvertently sign invalid repeated header fields because this check
        had not been required in the DKIM process. These same DKIM domains are also likely to
        establish themselves as being Too Big To Block. These TBTB domains can then be used to spoof
        other domains that may have otherwise established a high level of trust by implementing the
        hack where, due to this defect in DKIM, can still do nothing in their defense from the
        perspective of now deceived recipients.</t>
      <t>This vulnerability in DKIM represents an exploit allowing serious attacks caused by
        erroneous assumptions made in DKIM's signature process. There is also a header field, which
        because of its label, may potentially mislead recipients into believing it contains valid
        "Authentication-Results" <xref target="RFC5451"/>. Common phrases such as
        "Authentication-Results", "pass", and "fail", rather than use of result codes belies
        introductory claims this header is not intended for direct human consumption.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Barriers to an Authenticated Domain">
      <t>Some advocate use of DKIM as a means to obtain domain references based on the increased
        prevalence of this protocol. DKIM is independent of the domain actually sending the message
        and the recipient by design. Unfortunately, DKIM also does not attempt to protect against
        likely abuses that are also beyond the control of the signing domain in which DKIM signature
        validity conveys no assurance pre-fixed header fields have not changed what recipients see.
        As such, DKIM signing domains can not be held accountable for incidents of abuse appearing
        to violate subscription policies or that spoof other domains.</t>
      <t>Because of DKIM's vulnerability to header field spoofing, it would not be safe to express
        positive reputations either. Any such assurance could be exploited by malefactors to deceive
        those trusting DKIM results. In short, a DKIM signed domain as currently defined, can not be
        safely used in any context, other than the most rigid exclusion of any unsigned content
        which is well beyond any existing implementation. DKIM can not be safely used for email
        reputation as currently defined.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Domains as a Basis for Managing Traffic">
      <t>A manageable basis for assessments can leverage a smaller number of related domains,
        compared to IPv6 or even IPv4 addresses. Although technically the domain name space can be
        larger than the massively large IPv6 address space, in practice it is not. One hundred
        thousand domains control 90% of Internet traffic out of approximately 100 million domains
        active each month. The top 150 domains control 50% of the traffic, and the top 2,500 domains
        control 75%. This level of domain consolidation permits effective fast-path white-listing.
        Improvements achieved using domains to consolidate the threat landscape can easily justify
        added cryptographic authentication burdens. Even APL resource records <xref target="RFC3123"
        /> can authenticate EHLO using a single DNS transaction, but this would not allow IPv6 email
        to be more easily managed when facing extensive use of transitional technologies such as
        ISATAP, Teredo, 6to4, NAT64, and DNS64, which cryptographic technology can offer.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="XMPP Shows the Way Forward">
      <t>In addition to SMTP <xref target="RFC5321"/> using StartTLS <xref target="RFC3207"/> XMPP
          <xref target="RFC6122"/> uses StartTLS <xref target="RFC6120"/> over a different port with
        many of the features used by web servers such as <xref target="RFC2560"/> as one means to
        increase scalability. It seems plausible that by defining SMTP access over a different port
        is where a new authentication and international requirements can be resolved together. Of
        course, port 25 can be used where it might require StartTLS in the case of IPv6
        connections.</t>
      <t>Many administrators overlook a serious problem made much worse by chatty protocols that
        impose processing delays. Examining server logs will not reveal any problem either, because
        the limited resource being consumed is the number of outstanding connections TCP is able to
        support. Reaching this limit will prevent new connections from being instantiated but this
        is not logged as an event. Over time administrators may hear complaints email is not being
        delivered or just see an ever growing percentage of spam.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This draft intends to describe serious security concerns raised with use of DKIM that is
        exacerbated with IPv6 email. The contained recommendations are expected to reduce these
        security concerns. To better ensure security, the DKIM specification must change.</t>
      <t>Recommendations <xref target="DKIM-MH-Attack"/> rejected by the DKIM WG were aimed at
        repairing this defect by simply requiring the definition for a valid DKIM signature to
        ensure no invalid repeated header fields are present. It is also clear that the
        non-normative language describing the non-intuitive approach of listing non-existent header
        fields has not been widely embraced, especially by the domains sensitive to storage
        requirements. The overall storage requirement was one of weighing factors in selecting
        between IIM and DKIM. IIM's inclusion of the public key within the message was considered an
        unnecessary waste of storage. It seems many also consider the prophylactic listing of
        non-existent header fields an unnecessary waste as well. Based upon the current data, the
        present DKIM specification did not result in something that can retain trust, and that
        ultimately leads to even greater protocol layer violations.</t>

            <t>Through inadvertence or malice, a message may be received having multiple occurrences
              of single only header fields per [RFC5322]. To provide results upon which subsequent
              agents can rely, verifiers MUST detect an invalid number of single only header fields
              present within the Signature header field's "h=" list and return PERMFAIL (illegal
              multiple header fields).</t>
