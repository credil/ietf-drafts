1. Introduction

   The demand for P2MP traffic is expected to increase due to the
   increase in new services such as IP-TV and video distribution
   services. Moreover considering the global trend to improve energy
   efficiency, a P2MP transport function in MPLS-TP could be one of the
   solutions to achieve this goal from the perspective of efficient use
   of network resources.

   RFC5654[1] defines the following requirements which are specific to
   P2MP.

   - Traffic-engineered point-to-multipoint (P2MP) transport paths.(item
   6)
   - Unidirectional point-to-multipoint transport paths (item 8)
   - Being capable of using P2MP server (sub)layer capabilities when
   supporting P2MP MPLS-TP transport paths(item 40)
   - The MPLS-TP control plane MUST support establishing all the
   connectivity patterns defined for the MPLS-TP data plane (i.e.
   unidirectional P2MP) including configuration of protection functions
   and any associated maintenance functions.(item 50)
   Unidirectional 1+1 protection for P2MP connectivity (item 65 C)
   - Unidirectional 1:n protection for P2MP connectivity(item 67 B)
   - MPLS-TP recovery in a ring MUST protect unidirectional P2MP
   transport paths.(item 95)

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP p2mp OAM framework              July 2012


   RFC5860[2] defines MPLS-TP OAM requirements including those for
   unidirectional P2MP transport paths. In case of unidirectional P2MP
   transport path, two cased are assumed as per section 3.3 of
   RFC6371[3]. One is when an "out-of-band" return path exists and it is
   used and the other is when any return path does not exist or is not
   use. Missing OAM requirements which are necessary in P2MP transport
   networks are those in the latter case.

   In I-D[4], Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) is
   planned to be specified in clause 4. According to the editor's note,
   this section will contain a summary of point-to-multipoint OAM as
   described in RFC6371[3] that defines the overall OAM architecture for
   MPLS-TP.

   However, considering the missing OAM requirements in case that a
   return paths don't exist, the most appropriate place where they could
   be added is I-D[4]. Therefore, this draft intends to provide texts
   which should be included in OAM section and network management
   section of the I-D[4].

3. P2MP OAM

   Note: It is proposed that this section be incorporated in section 4
   of I-D[4].

   Unidirectional P2MP is supported in MPLS-TP. This means that "in-
   band" return path is out of scope. In this section, only two cases,

   with out-band return path and without return path, are considered and
   requirements should be independently specified, if necessary.

   P2MP considerations are described in section 3.7 of RFC6371. The RFC
   has already described some requirements with out-band return path(s).
   On the other hand, even if there is no return path, parts of OAM
   requirements in RFC5860 could be met by supporting management
   interface through which EMS/NMS can retrieve the received OAM packets.

   Note: In the following sections, basically additional requirements
   are described function-by-function, which haven't been covered or
   clarified in RFC5860[2] and RFC6371[3] have particularly focused on
   the case that return paths doen't exist.

  3.1. OAM functions for proactive monitoring

3.1.1. Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification

   Continuity Check function enable one or more leaf MEPs on
   unidirectional P2MP transport path to monitor the continuity of OAM
   packets from root MEP and detect one or more loss of continuity(LOC)
   defect between the root MEP and the leaf MEPs. Connectivity
   Verification function enables one or more leaf MEPs on P2MP transport
   path to monitor the connectivity of OAM packets from a specific root
   MEP and detect an unexpected connectivity defect between two MEGs(two
   P2MP transport paths)

   Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification MUST be supported in
   case that a return path in a unidirectional P2MP transport path
   doesn't exist. This requirement is already included in section 2.2.3
   of RFC5860[2].

   As described in RFC6371[3], CC-V OAM packets are used for P2MP
   transport path. Defect detection mechanisms in P2MP transport paths
   are the same as those of P2MP transport path specified in section 5.1
   of RFC6371. That is, loss of continuity defect, mis-connectivity
   defect, period mis-configuration defect and unexpected encapsulation
   defect. Entry criteria and exist criteria are also the same as those
   of P2MP transport path in RFC6371[3]. Moreover, consequent actions of
   unidirectional P2MP transport path are also covered in section 5.1.2
   of the RFC[3]

   Regarding configuration consideration, following additional
   requirements on unidirectional P2MP transport path in case that the
   return paths don't exist.

   1. EMS/NMS should provide a tool to manually configure consistent
      values on each piece of configuration information (MEG-ID, MEP-ID,
      list of the other MEPs in the MEG, PHB for E-LSPs, transmission
      rate) to a root-MEP and all the related leaf-MEPs in a MEG of a
      P2MP transport path.

   2. Mis-matches of configuration information (MEG-ID, MEP-ID, PHB for
      E-LSPs, transmission rate) between a root MEP and any leaf-MEP at
      which proactive monitoring is enabled, should be detected as a
      configuration mis-match alarm by parsing received CC-VOAM packets.

   3. Mis-matches of configuration information (MEG-ID, MEP-ID, list of
      the other MEPs in the MEG, PHB for E-LSPs, transmission rate)
      between a leaf MEP and any other leaf-MEP, at which proactive
      monitoring are enabled, may be detected through configuration
      management process of EMS/NMS as a configuration mis-match alarm
      without receiving OAM packets from a source MEP.

   4. Configuration information mis-match alarms described in 4 and 5
      may be supported in case that a proactive monitoring is not
      enabled in order to check those mis-matches before monitoring
      functions are enabled.

   5. Enabling or disabling configuration mis-matich alarms must be able
      to be configured at each leaf-MEP independently.

3.1.2. Remote Defect Indication

   This OAM function is not available on P2MP transport path in case
   that return paths don't exist, because this function is implemented
   only on the return path.

3.1.3. Alarm Reporting

   Alarm Reporting functions MUST be supported in case that a return
   path in a unidirectional P2MP transport paths don't exist. This is
   already included in section 2.2.8 of RFC5860[2].

   6. EMS/NMS should provide a tool to manually configure consistent
      values on "hold-off intervals prior to asserting an alarm to the
      management system" and AIS transmission period to all the leaf-
      MEPs in a MEG of a P2MP transport path.

   7. Mis-matches of configuration information (hold-off interval and
      AIS transmission period) between a root MEP and any leaf-MEP at
      which alarm reporting is enabled, should be detected as a
      configuration mis-match alarm by parsing received AIS OAM packets.

      AIS transmission period) between a leaf MEP and any other leaf-MEP,
      at which alarm reporting is enabled, may be detected through
      configuration management process of EMS/NMS as a configuration
      mis-match alarm without receiving OAM packets from a source MEP.

   9. Configuration information mis-match alarms described in 4 and 5
      may be supported in case that a alarm reporting is not enabled in
      order to check those mis-matches before monitoring functions are
      enabled.

   specific root MEP and detect an unexpected connectivity defect
   between two MEGs(two P2MP transport paths)
