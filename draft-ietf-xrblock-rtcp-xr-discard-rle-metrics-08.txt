RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) for Run Length Encoding
                       (RLE) of Discarded Packets
           draft-ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard-rle-metrics-08

Abstract

   The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with the Real-
   time Transport Protocol (RTP) in to provide a variety of short-term
   and long-term reception statistics.  The available reporting may
   include aggregate information across longer periods of time as well
   as individual packet reporting.  This document specifies a per-packet
   report metric capturing individual packets discarded from the de-
   jitter buffer after successful reception.

Internet-Draft            RTCP XR Discard RLE              November 2013


   RTP [RFC3550] provides a transport for real-time media flows such as
   audio and video together with the RTP control protocol (RTCP) which
   provides periodic feedback about the media streams received in a
   specific duration.  In addition, RTCP can be used for timely feedback
   about individual events to report (e.g., packet loss) [RFC4585].
   Both long-term and short-term feedback enable a media sender to adapt
   its media transmission and/or encoding dynamically to the observed
   path characteristics.

   RFC3611 [RFC3611] defines RTCP Extended Reports as a detailed
   reporting framework to provide more than just the coarse Receiver
   Report (RR) statistics.  The detailed reporting may enable a media
   sender to react more appropriately to the observed networking
   conditions as these can be characterized better, although at the
   expense of extra overhead.

   Among many other report blocks, RFC3611 specifies the Loss Run Length
   Encoding (RLE) block which reports runs of packets received and lost
   with the granularity of individual packets.  This can help both error
   recovery and path loss characterization.  In addition to lost
   packets, RFC3611 defines the notion of "discarded" packets: packets
   that were received but dropped from the de-jitter buffer because they
   were either too early (for buffering) or too late (for playout).  The
   "discard rate" metric is part of the VoIP metrics report block even
   though it is not just applicable to audio: it is specified as the
   fraction of discarded packets since the beginning of the session.
   See section 4.7.1 of RFC3611 [RFC3611].  The discard metric is
   believed to be applicable to a large class of RTP applications which
   use a de-jitter buffer RFC5481 [RFC5481].

   Recently proposed extensions to the Extended Reports (XR) reporting
   suggest enhancing this discard metric:

   o  Reporting the number of discarded packets in a measurement
      interval, i.e., during either the last reporting interval or since
      the beginning of the session, as indicated by a flag in the
      suggested XR report [RFC7002].  If an endpoint needs to report
      packet discard due to other reasons than early- and late-arrival
      (for example, discard due to duplication, redundancy, etc.)  then
      it should consider using the Discarded Packets Report Block
      [RFC7002].

   o  Reporting gaps and bursts of discarded packets during a
      measurement interval, i.e., the last reporting interval or the
      duration of the session [RFC7003].

Internet-Draft            RTCP XR Discard RLE              November 2013


   o  Reporting the sum of payload bytes discarded during a measurement
      interval, i.e., the last reporting interval or the duration of the
      session [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-bytes-discarded-metric].

   However, none of these metrics allow a receiver to report precisely
   which packets were discarded.  While this information could in theory
   be derived from high-frequency reporting on the number of discarded
   packets [RFC7002] or from the gap/burst report [RFC7003], these two
   mechanisms do not appear feasible: The former would require an unduly
   high amount of reporting which still might not be sufficient due to
   the non-deterministic scheduling of RTCP packets.  The latter incur
   significant complexity and reporting overhead and might still not
   deliver the desired accuracy.

   This document defines a discard report block following the idea of
   the run-length encoding applied for lost and received packets in
   [RFC3611].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   The terminology defined in RTP [RFC3550] and in the extensions for XR
   reporting [RFC3611] applies.

3.  XR Discard RLE Report Block

   The XR Discard RLE report block uses the same format as specified for
   the loss and duplicate report blocks in [RFC3611].  Figure 1
   describes the packet format.  The fields "BT", "T", "block length",
   "SSRC of source", "begin_seq", and "end_seq" have the same semantics
   and representation as defined in [RFC3611], with the addition of the
   "E" flag to indicate the reason for discard.  The "chunks" encoding
   the run length have the same representation as in RFC3611, but encode
   discarded packets.  A definition of a discarded packet is given in
   [RFC7002].

                   Figure 1: XR Discard RLE Report Block

   Block Type (BT, 8 bits): A Run-length encoded Discarded Packets
   Report Block is identified by the constant DRLE.

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace DRLE with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.  Please remove this note prior to
   publication as an RFC.]

   rsvd (3 bits): This field is reserved for future definition.  In the
   absence of such definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to
   zero and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   The 'E' bit is introduced to distinguish between packets discarded
   due to early arrival and those discarded due to late arrival.  The
   'E' bit is set to '1' if the chunks represent packets discarded due
   to too early arrival and is set to '0' otherwise.

   In case both early and late discarded packets shall be reported, two
   Discard RLE report blocks MUST be included; their sequence number
   range MAY overlap, but individual packets MUST only be reported as
   either early or late and not appear marked in both.  If packets
   appear in both report blocks, the conflicting packets are ignored.
   Packets reported in neither are considered to be properly received
   and not discarded.

   Discard RLE Report Blocks SHOULD be sent in conjunction with an RTCP
   RR as a compound RTCP packet.

4.  Protocol Operation

   This section describes the behavior of the reporting node (= media
   receiver) and the media sender.

4.1.  Reporting Node (Receiver)

   Transmission of RTCP XR Discard RLE Reports is up to the discretion
   of the media receiver, as is the reporting granularity.  However, it
   is RECOMMENDED that the media receiver signals all discarded packets
   using the method defined in this document.  If all packets over a
   reporting period were discarded, the media receiver MAY use the
   Discard Report Block [RFC7002] instead.  In case of limited available
   reporting bandwidth, it is up to the receiver whether or not to
   include RTCP XR Discard RLE reports.

   The media receiver MAY send the Discard RLE Reports as part of the
   regularly scheduled RTCP packets as per RFC3550.  It MAY also include
   Discard RLE Reports in immediate or early feedback packets as per
   RFC4585.

4.2.  Media Sender

   The media sender MUST be prepared to operate without receiving any
   Discard RLE reports.  If Discard RLE reports are generated by the
   media receiver, the media sender cannot rely on all these reports
   being received, nor can the media sender rely on a regular generation
   pattern from the media receiver.

   However, if the media sender receives any RTCP reports but no Discard
   RLE report blocks and is aware that the media receiver supports
   Discard RLE report blocks, it MAY assume that no packets were
   discarded at the media receiver.

5.  SDP signaling

   A participant of a media session MAY use SDP to signal its support
   for the report block specified in this document or use them without
   any prior signaling (see section 5 of [RFC3611]).

   For signaling in SDP, the RTCP XR attribute as defined in [RFC3611]
   MUST be used.  The SDP [RFC4566] attribute 'xr-format' defined in
   RFC3611 is augmented as described in the following to indicate the
   the discard RLE metric.

      rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)]
                       CRLF   ; defined in [RFC3611]

      xr-format       =/ xr-discard-rle

      xr-discard-rle   = "discard-rle"

Internet-Draft            RTCP XR Discard RLE              November 2013


   The parameter 'discard-rle' is used to indicate support for the
   Discard RLE Report Block defined in Section 3.

   When SDP is used in Offer/Answer context, the mechanism defined in
   [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters applies (see
   section 5.2 of [RFC3611]).

6.  Security Considerations

   The Discard RLE block provides per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   applies.  In some situations, returning very detailed error
   information (e.g., over-range measurement or measurement unavailable)
   using this report block can provide an attacker with insight into the
   security processing.  Implementers should consider the guidance in
   [I-D.ietf-avt-srtp-not-mandatory] for using appropriate security
   mechanisms, i.e., where security is a concern, the implementation
   should apply encryption and authentication to the report block.  For
   example this can be achieved by using the AVPF profile together with
   the Secure RTP profile as defined in [RFC3711]; an appropriate
   combination of the two profiles (an "SAVPF") is specified in
   [RFC5124].  However, other mechanisms also exist (documented in
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-security-options]) and might be more suitable.

   Additionally, The security considerations of [RFC3550], [RFC3611],
   and [RFC4585] apply.

7.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].
