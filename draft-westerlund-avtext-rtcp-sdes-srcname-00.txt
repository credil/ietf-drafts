           RTCP SDES Item SRCNAME to Label Individual Sources
              draft-westerlund-avtext-rtcp-sdes-srcname-00

Abstract

   This document defines a new SDES item called SRCNAME which uniquely
   identifies a single media source, like a camera or a microphone.
   That way anyone receiving the SDES information from a set of
   interlinked RTP sessions can determine which SSRCs are related to the
   same source.  It can equally be used to label SSRC multiplexed
   related streams, such as FEC or Retransmission streams related to the
   original source stream in the same session.  In addition the new SDES
   item is also defined for usage with the SDP source specific media
   attribute ("a=ssrc") enabling an end-point to declare and learn the
   source bindings ahead of receiving RTP/RTCP packets through
   signalling.

1.  Introduction

   RTP has always been a protocol that supports multiple participants
   each sending their own media streams in RTP sessions.  Previously
   many implementations have aimed only at point to point voice over IP
   with a single source in each end-point.  Even client implementations
   aimed at video conferences have often been built with the assumption
   around central mixers that only deliver a single media stream per
   media type.  However, more advanced client implementations may
   transmit multiple streams in the same RTP session and there may be
   tight relations between different streams and their SSRCs.  For
   example, a client with several cameras that uses simulcast to send
   streams with different encodings of the video from each camera have
   the need of conveying the relation of the streams to the receiver.  A
   similar example is a client with several cameras that uses SVC multi-
   session transmission [RFC6190] and also here the receiver needs to
   know which streams relate to which video source.  Other examples of
   tight relations are a retransmission stream and its original stream
   as well as the case of forward error correction (FEC) where a client
   can send source streams and associated repair streams.

   CNAME is not sufficient to express this relation although that is
   commonly inferred from end-points that have only one media stream per
   media type.  The primary use of CNAME in multi-source usages is
   instead to indicate which end-point and what synchronization context
   a particular media stream relates to and that usually means that all
   streams sent from a client have the same CNAME.  We are neither
   relying on using the same SSRC for all streams related to a
   particular media source as it is not robust against SSRC collision
   and forces potentially cascading SSRC changes between sessions.
   Also, using the same SSRC is not possible when SSRC-multiplexing is
   used.

   A common solution to convey the relation between streams is to use
   SDP attributes.  Session-multiplexed streams can be associated with
   an attribute that groups different RTP sessions and SSRC-multiplexed
   streams can be grouped at the media level for each RTP session.  For
   example, in Forward Error Correction Grouping Semantics in the
   Session Description Protocol [RFC5956] an SDP media level attribute
   called "ssrc-group:FEC-FR" is used for grouping FEC associations when
   the different streams from a source are SSRC-multiplexed in the same
   RTP session.  Using SDP attributes may work fine in the case when the
   receivers of the streams also get an SDP describing the bindings of
   all the streams, but that is not always the case.  One such example
   is a conference session where clients are communicating with each
   other via an RTP Translator.  The RTP Translator forwards all RTP and
   RTCP traffic from a client to all other clients and the clients can
   be prepared to receive any number of streams of certain specified

   media.  When a new client joins the session the other clients may not
   be notified with a SIP Update including a new SDP, instead the
   clients will detect the new client's streams via RTP and RTCP.  In
   this case there is no way for a client to identify if certain streams
   are related to each other since that information only was included in
   the SDP.

   RTP Retransmission Payload Format [RFC4588] describes a solution for
   finding the association between original streams and retransmission
   streams when SSRC-multiplexing is used.  The association can be
   resolved when the receiver receives a retransmission packet matching
   a retransmission request sent earlier.  However, the RFC continues
   with describing that this mechanism might fail if there are two
   outstanding requests for the same packet sequence number in two
   different original streams of a session.  Therefore, to avoid
   ambiguity in unicast a receiver MUST NOT have two outstanding
   requests for the same packet sequence number in two different
   original streams before the association is resolved.  For multicast,
   however, this ambiguity cannot be avoided and SSRC-multiplexing of
   original and retransmission streams is therefore prohibited in
   multicast.  By defining a solution for one to one mapping between an
   original stream and any supporting streams this issue can be avoided
   in the future.  Note: This document does not update RFC 4588 to use
   this solution, but it may be done in the future.

   To enable an RTP session participant to determine the close relation
   of different streams without the above mentioned problems, a new
   method for identifying such sources is needed.  RTP [RFC3550] defines
   the Source Description RTCP Packet (SDES), which contains one or more
   chunks, each of which is composed of SDES items describing the SSRC
   identified in that chunk.  None of the present SDES items is,
   however, suitable for uniquely identifying a media source.

   Therefore we propose that one defines a new SDES item called the
   SRCNAME which with a unique label identifies a single media source,
   like a camera or a microphone.  The source may also be a particular
   media mix or conceptual stream, such as the "most active speaker"
   output by a RTP mixer performing stream switching.  That way anyone
   receiving the SDES information from a set of interlinked RTP sessions
   or multiple SSRCs in the same session can determine which SSRCs are
   the same source.  Connecting streams with SRCNAME can be done
   irrespective of which multiplexing type is used and it solves the
   problems with the current solutions described above.

   It is, however, possible that a receiver will receive the RTP streams
   before receiving SDES packets with all SRCNAME items and that would
   mean that the receiver cannot make the connections between SSRCs and
   SRCNAMEs when starting to receive the media.  "Source-Specific Media

   Attributes in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)" [RFC5576]
   defines a way of declaring different attributes for SSRCs in each
   session in SDP and if a new source attribute is added to this
   framework it would be suitable for conveying the connections between
   SSRCs and SRCNAMEs before the media communication starts.  Thus, in
   addition to the new SDES item we also define a new SDP source-
   specific media attribute called srcname, which enables an end-point
   to declare and learn the source bindings ahead of receiving RTP/RTCP
   packets.  Of course, this new SDP source attribute will not be useful
   for the case described above when clients did not get updates with
   new client's stream bindings, but it will be useful in most other
   cases.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  SDES Item SRCNAME

   Source Descriptions are a method that should work with all RTP
   topologies (assuming that any intermediary node is supporting this
   item) and existing RTP extensions.  Thus we propose that one defines
   a new SDES item called the SRCNAME which with a unique identifier
   identifies a single media source, like a camera, a microphone, a
   particular media mix, or conceptual stream.  That way anyone
   receiving the SDES information from a set of interlinked RTP sessions
   or SSRCs in a single session can determine which SSRCs are related to
   the same source.

   The SRCNAME is RECOMMENDED to be per communication session unique
   random identifiers generated according to "Guidelines for Choosing
   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Names (CNAMEs)" [RFC6222] with
   the addition that a local counter enumerating the sources on the host
   also is concatenated to the key in step 4 prior to calculating the
   hash.  The SRCNAME included in an RTCP packet MUST fulfill the
   requirements Section 6.5 in RTP [RFC3550] puts on SDES item values in
   general.  These requirements is that it is a UTF-8 [RFC3629] string
   that have a maximum length of 255 bytes.

   This SRCNAME's relation to CNAME is the following.  CNAME represents
   an end-point and a synchronization context.  If the different sources
   identified by SRCNAMEs should be played out synchronized when
   receiving them in a multi-stream context, then the sources need to be
   in the same synchronization context.  Thus in all cases, all SSRCs



Westerlund, et al.       Expires April 26, 2012                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              RTCP SDES SRCNAME               October 2011


   with the same SRCNAME will have the same CNAME.  A given CNAME may
   contain multiple sets of sources using different SRCNAMEs.

   The SDES SRCNAME item follows the same format as the other SDES items
   defined in RTP [RFC3550]:
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | SRCNAME=TBA1  |     length    | source name                 ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   When using the SRCNAME SDES item it is equally important to CNAME,
   thus it is RECOMMENDED to be included in all full compound RTCP
   packets being sent.  It MAY also be included in non-compound packets
   in cases where the implementation believes that there might be new
   receivers needing the information.


4.  SRCNAME in SDP

   "Source-Specific Media Attributes in the Session Description Protocol
   (SDP)" [RFC5576] defines a way of declaring attributes for SSRC in
   each session in SDP.  With a new SDES item, one can use this
   framework to define how also the SRCNAME can be provided in the SDP
   for each SSRC in each RTP session, thus enabling an end-point to
   declare and learn the source bindings ahead of receiving RTP/RTCP
   packets.

   Hence, we propose a new SDP source attribute called srcname with the
   following structure:
   a=ssrc:<ssrc-id> srcname:<srcname>

   The srcname value MUST be identical to the SRCNAME value the media
   sender will send in the SDES SRCNAME item in the SDES RTCP packets.

   FormalABNF syntax [RFC5234] for the "srcname" attribute:
   srcname-attr = "srcname:" srcname

   ssrcname = byte-string
      ; The definition of "byte-string" is in RFC 4566.

   attribute =/ srcname-attr
      ; The definition of "attribute" is in RFC 4566.

5.  Examples

   This section shows SDP examples of declaring the SRCNAME in SDP.
   Only the relevant parts of the SDP are shown to improve readability.
   Please note that the below examples are all hypothetical as no
   decision has yet been to use the SRCNAME mechanism with the
   respective example.

5.1.  Simulcast

   In this use case the end-point is a client with a single audio source
   and two video sources and it uses simulcast for sending different
   encodings of the same video source.  This example is based on Using
   Simulcast in RTP sessions [I-D.westerlund-avtcore-rtp-simulcast].
   The following SDP describes this.
   s=Simulcast enabled client

   a=imageattr:96 send [x=320,y=180]
   a=ssrc:239245219 cname:alice@foo.example.com
   a=ssrc:239245219 srcname:a3:d3:4b:f1:22:12
   a=ssrc:734623563 cname:alice@foo.example.com
   a=ssrc:734623563 srcname:7a:39:a9:3e:28:f7
   a=mid:3
   a=sendonly

   The audio session is proposing to use one stereo stream of G.719 and
   the video sessions are proposing to send two different encodings of
   each video source, one with the resolution 640x360 and one with
   320x180.  The end-point also declares the SSRCs it intends to use
   with bindings to CNAME and SRCNAME, enabling the receiver of the SDP
   to bind together the video streams that originates from the same

   video camera.

   The use of the srcname attribute in the SDP is optional and the
   information can be retrieved from RTCP reporting, but it will then
   not be possible to correctly relate the video sources until the first
   RTCP report is received.

5.2.  SVC with multi-session transmission

   Here an example is shown of a client that uses SVC with multi-session
   transmission as described in RTP Payload Format for Scalable Video
   Coding [RFC6190].  RTP Payload Format for Scalable Video Coding
   [RFC6190] only describes examples for a client with one video source
   and the decoder dependencies of the different sessions are grouped
   using the Session grouping DDP attribute as defined in Signaling
   Media Decoding Dependency in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC5583] and implicitly CNAME.

   However, if a client has two video sources and wishes to use multi-
   session transmission and send streams from both sources in each
   session an additional grouping mechanism is needed to group the
   different streams in the different sessions.  SRCNAME is suitable for
   this and here we show an example where the DDP attribute groups the
   different sessions and the SRCNAME is used to relate the different
   SSRCs in each RTP session to one of the two video sources.

   Thus, the client declares that it will send two video streams in each
   RTP session and the receiver is then able to relate the streams in
   the different sessions by using the SRCNAME binding.  Without the
   SRCNAME binding it would not be possible for the receiver to know
   which streams belong to the same source.

5.3.  Retransmission

   This use case shows how SRCNAME can be used to connect retransmission
   streams to the original streams in the case of SSRC multiplexed RTP
   retransmission [RFC4588].  This is included to exemplify how RTP
   retransmission could be updated to provide explicit bindings between
   the source and the repair stream, but just an example and not a
   specification.

   The client proposes to send two original video streams in the video
   session and a retransmission stream for each one of them.  The
   retransmission streams are associated with the respective original
   stream by using the same SRCNAME and a receiver would then know which
   original stream a certain retransmission stream is associated with.
   This solves the ambiguity problem when SSRC-multiplexing is used for
   retransmission and it enables SSRC-multiplexing of original and
   retransmission streams to be used also in multicast sessions.

5.4.  Forward Error Correction

   Forward Error Correction Grouping Semantics in the Session
   Description Protocol [RFC5956] defines two SDP attributes for
   grouping the associated source and FEC-based repair streams.  One can
   be used for grouping different RTP sessions and the other can be used
   for grouping SSRCs in the same RTP session, i.e. when session-
   respective SSRC-multiplexing is used.  However, it may be
   advantageous to SSRC-multiplex the source streams in one RTP session
   and the repair streams in another since that gives a receiver the
   possibility to reject the repair session in case it does not support
   the proposed FEC.  In this case the above mentioned grouping
   attributes cannot be used to associate the repair streams with the
   respective source stream since grouping of SSRCs cannot be made
   across RTP sessions.  The following example shows how SRCNAME can be
   used for that.

   In this example the client proposes to send two video streams in one
   session and two repair streams in the other session.  The repair
   streams are associated with the respective video stream by using the
   same SRCNAME.  When receiving either this SDP or the SDES SRCNAME
   packets a receiver can make the connection between the source streams
   and the repair streams.  Even a client not receiving the SDP will be
   able to do the association if it has established one RTP session for
   receiving source streams and another for receiving repair streams.


6.  Usage with the Offer/Answer Model

   The SDP offer/answer procedures for the a=ssrc is specified in
   Source-Specific Media Attributes in the Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) [RFC5576].


7.  Backward Compatibility

   Clients not supporting SRCNAME will not have the possibility to bind
   different streams to a specific media source, since they will not
   understand the SRCNAME SDES item.  However, sending SRCNAME SDES
   items to a client not supporting it should not impose any problems
   since all clients should be prepared that new SDES items may be
   specified according to RTP [RFC3550].

   According to the definition of SDP attributes in SDP: Session
   Description Protocol [RFC4566], if an attribute is received that is
   not understood, it MUST be ignored by the receiver.  So a receiver

Internet-Draft              RTCP SDES SRCNAME               October 2011


   not supporting the ssrc attribute will simply ignore it.

   Source-Specific Media Attributes in the Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) [RFC5576] defines rules of how new source attributes should be
   registered, which means that a receiver supporting RFC5576 should be
   prepared that new source attributes may be defined.  This means that
   a user supporting some of the source attributes should not have any
   problems when the user receives an SDP with unknown source
   attributes.


8.  IANA Considerations

   Following the guidelines in SDP [RFC4566], in The Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework [RFC5888], and in RTP [RFC3550],
   the IANA is requested to register:

   1.  A new SDES item named SRCNAME, as defined in Section 3.  This
       item needs to be assigned an identifier TBA1.

   2.  A new SDP source attribute named srcname, as defined in
       Section 4.


9.  Security Considerations

   The SDES SRCNAMEs being opaque identifiers could potentially carry
   additional meanings or function as overt channel.  If the SRCNAME
   would be permanent between sessions, they have the potential for
   compromising the users' privacy as they can be tracked between
   sessions.  See Guidelines for Choosing RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
   Canonical Names (CNAMEs) [RFC6222] for more discussion.

   A third party modification of the srcname labels either in the RTCP
   SDES items or in the SDP a=ssrc attribute can cause service
   disruption.  By modifying labels the wrong streams could be
   associated, with potentially serious effects including media
   disruptions.  If streams that are to be associated aren't associated,
   then another type of failures occur.  To prevent modification,
   insertion or deletion of the srcname labels the carrying channel
   needs to be protected by integrity protection and source
   authentication.  For RTCP various solutions exist, such as SRTP
   [RFC3711], DTLS [RFC4347], IPsec [RFC4301].  For protecting the SDP
   the signalling channel needs to provide protection.  For SIP S/MIME
   [RFC3261] are the ideal, and hop by hopTLS [RFC5246] provides at
   least some protection, although not perfect.  For SDP's retrieved
   using RTSP DESCRIBE [RFC2326] TLS would be the RECOMMENDED solution.
