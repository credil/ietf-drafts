Internet-Draft             Bidi IRI Guidelines              October 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   Some UCS characters, such as those used in the Arabic and Hebrew
   scripts, have an inherent right-to-left (rtl) writing direction as
   opposed to characters, such as those in the Latin script, that have
   an inherent left-to-right (ltr) direction.  IRIs containing rtl
   characters (called bidirectional IRIs or Bidi IRIs) require
   additional attention because of the non-trivial relation between
   their logical and visual ordering.  The logical order represents the
   order in which characters are stored on computers and read by people.
   The visual order is the order in which the characters appear (or are
   expected to appear) on a computer display or printout.

   Generally, alphabetic characters in scripts like Arabic and Hebrew
   are drawn rtl while numbers are drawn ltr.  Symbols such as slash
   ('/') and period ('.') take their visual direction from the
   surrounding characters.  A list of all ASCII symbols with their
   bidirectional character type and their function in URIs and IRIs is
   given in Appendix A.

   Because of this complex interaction between the logical
   representation, the visual representation, and the syntax of a Bidi
   IRI, a balance is needed between various requirements.  The main
   requirements are:

   1. user-predictable conversion between visual and logical
      representation;

   2. the ability to include a wide range of characters in various parts
      of the IRI; and

   3. minor or no changes or restrictions for implementations.

1.2.  Availability

   This document is available in (line-printer ready) plaintext ASCII
   and in PDF.  It is also available in HTML from
   http://www.sw.it.aoyama.ac.jp/2012/pub/
   draft-ietf-iri-bidi-guidelines-03.html, and in UTF-8 plaintext from
   http://www.sw.it.aoyama.ac.jp/2012/pub/
   draft-ietf-iri-bidi-guidelines-03.utf8.txt.  While all these versions
   are identical in their technical content, the HTML, PDF, and UTF-8
   plaintext versions show non-Unicode characters directly.  This often
   makes it easier to understand examples, and readers are therefore
   strongly advised to consult one of these versions in preference to or
   as a supplement to the ASCII version.

Internet-Draft             Bidi IRI Guidelines              October 2012


1.3.  Notation

   In this document, "Bidi Notation", abbreviated "BN" is used for the
   given Bidi IRI examples as follows: Lower case letters a-z stand for
   characters that are written with a left to right ordering (such as
   Latin characters), whereas upper case letters A-Z represent
   characters that are written right to left (such as Arabic or Hebrew
   characters).  Numbers and symbols are the same.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Logical Storage and Visual Presentation

   When stored or transmitted in digital representation, Bidi IRIs MUST
   be in full logical order and MUST conform to the IRI syntax rules
   (which includes the rules relevant to their scheme).  This ensures
   that Bidi IRIs can be processed in the same way as other IRIs.

   Bidi IRIs MUST be visually ordered by the Unicode Bidirectional
   Algorithm [UNIV6], [UNI9].  Bidi IRIs MUST be rendered in the same
   way as they would be if they were in a left-to-right embedding.

   In conformance with the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm, embedding
   MAY be done in one of two ways:

   1. precede the IRI with U+202A, LEFT-TO-RIGHT EMBEDDING (LRE), and
      follow with U+202C, POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING (PDF); or

   2. use a higher-level protocol (e.g., the dir='ltr' attribute in
      HTML).

   Preceding and following the Bidi IRI with U+200E, LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK
   (LRM) is NOT RECOMMENDED as, there are cases where this may not be
   sufficient to match full left to right embedding.

   There is no requirement to use embedding if the display is still the
   same without the embedding.  For example, a Bidi IRI in a text with
   left-to-right base directionality (such as used for English or
   Cyrillic) that is preceded and followed by whitespace and strong
   left-to-right characters does not need an embedding.  Also, a
   bidirectional relative IRI reference that only contains strong right-
   to-left characters and weak characters (such as symbols) and that
   starts and ends with a strong right-to-left character and appears in
   a text with right-to-left base directionality (such as used for
   Arabic or Hebrew) and is preceded and followed by whitespace and

Internet-Draft             Bidi IRI Guidelines              October 2012


   strong characters does not need an embedding.

   However, implementers are RECOMMENDED to use embedding in all cases
   where they are not completely sure that the display behavior is
   unaffected without the embedding.

   The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm ([UNI9], section 4.3) permits
   higher-level protocols to influence bidirectional rendering.  Such
   changes by higher-level protocols MUST NOT be used if they change the
   rendering of IRIs.

   The bidirectional formatting characters that may be used before or
   after the IRI to ensure correct display are not themselves part of
   the IRI.  IRIs MUST NOT contain bidirectional formatting characters
   (LRM, RLM, LRE, RLE, LRO, RLO, and PDF).  They affect the visual
   rendering of the IRI but do not appear themselves.  It would
   therefore not be possible to input an IRI with such characters
   correctly.


3.  Bidi IRI Structure

   The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm is designed for general purpose
   text.  To make sure that it does not affect the rendering of Bidi
   IRIs outside of the requirements of this document, some restrictions
   on Bidi IRIs are necessary.  These restrictions are given in terms of
   delimiters (structural characters, mostly punctuation such as "@",
   ".", ":", and "/") and components (usually consisting mostly of
   letters and digits).

   The following syntax rules from the ABNF of [RFC3987bis] correspond
   to components for the purpose of Bidi behavior: iuserinfo, ireg-name,
   isegment, isegment-nz, isegment-nz-nc, ireg-name, iquery, and
   ifragment.

   Specifications that define the syntax of any of the above components
   MAY divide them further and define smaller parts to be components
   according to this document.  As an example, the restrictions of
   [RFC3490] on bidirectional domain names correspond to treating each
   label of a domain name as a component for schemes with ireg-name as a
   domain name.  Even where the components are not defined formally, it
   may be helpful to think about some syntax in terms of components and
   to apply the relevant restrictions.  For example, for the usual name/
   value syntax in query parts, it is convenient to treat each name and
   each value as a component.  As another example, the extensions in a
   resource name can be treated as separate components.

   For each component, the following restrictions apply:



Duerst, et al.           Expires April 24, 2013                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             Bidi IRI Guidelines              October 2012


   1. A component SHOULD NOT use both right-to-left and left-to-right
      characters.

   2. A component using right-to-left characters SHOULD start with a
      right-to-left character, and end with a right-to-left character
      potentially followed by one or more nonspacing mark (bidi class
      NSM).

   The above restrictions are given as "SHOULD"s, rather than as
   "MUST"s.  For IRIs that are never presented visually, they are not
   relevant.  However, for IRIs in general, they are very important to
   ensure consistent conversion between visual presentation and logical
   representation, in both directions.

   Note:  In some components, the above restrictions may actually be
      strictly enforced.  For example, [RFC3490] requires that these
      restrictions apply to the labels of a host name for those schemes
      where ireg-name is a host name.  In some other components (for
      example, path components) following these restrictions may not be
      too difficult.  For other components, such as parts of the query
      part, it may be very difficult to enforce the restrictions because
      the values of query parameters may be arbitrary character
      sequences.

   If the above restrictions cannot be satisfied otherwise, the affected
   component can always be mapped to URI notation using the general
   percent-encoding of IRI components, as described in [RFC3987bis].
   Please note that the whole component has to be mapped (see also
   Example 9 below).


4.  Input of Bidi IRIs

   Bidi input methods MUST generate Bidi IRIs in logical order while
   rendering them according to Section 2.  During input, rendering
   SHOULD be updated after every new character is input to avoid end-
   user confusion.


5.  Examples

   This section gives examples of Bidi IRIs in Bidi Notation.  It shows
   legal IRIs with the relationship between their logical and visual
   representation and explains how certain phenomena in this
   relationship may look strange to somebody not familiar with
   bidirectional behavior, but familiar to users of Arabic and Hebrew.
   It also shows what happens if the restrictions given in Section 3 are
   not followed.  Please see <Availability> for versions of the examples

   in Arabic and Hebrew script.

   To read the bidi text in the examples, read the visual representation
   from left to right until you encounter a block of rtl text.  Read the
   rtl block (including slashes and other special characters) from right
   to left, then continue at the next unread ltr character.

   Please note that "BN" stands for "Bidi Notation", see <Notation>.  AR
   stands for Arabic, HE for Hebrew.

   Example 1: A single component with rtl characters is inverted:
   Logical representation (BN): "http://ab.CDEFGH.ij/kl/mn/op.html"
   Visual representation (BN): "http://ab.HGFEDC.ij/kl/mn/op.html"
   Components can be read one by one, and each component can be read in
   its natural direction.

   Example 2: More than one consecutive component with rtl characters is
   inverted as a whole:
   Logical representation (BN): "http://ab.CDE.FGH/ij/kl/mn/op.html"
   Visual representation (BN): "http://ab.HGF.EDC/ij/kl/mn/op.html"
   A sequence of rtl components is read rtl, in the same way as a
   sequence of rtl words is read rtl in a bidi text.

   Example 3: All components of an IRI (except for the scheme) are rtl.
   All rtl components are inverted overall:
   Logical representation (BN):
   "http://AB.CD.EF/GH/IJ/KL?MN=OP;QR=ST#UV"
   Visual representation (BN): "http://VU#TS=RQ;PO=NM?LK/JI/HG/FE.DC.BA"
   The whole IRI (except the scheme) is read rtl.  Delimiters between
   rtl components stay between the respective components; delimiters
   between ltr and rtl components don't move.

   Example 4: Each of several sequences of rtl components is inverted on
   its own:
   Logical representation (BN): "http://AB.CD.ef/gh/IJ/KL.html"
   Visual representation (BN): "http://DC.BA.ef/gh/LK/JI.html"
   Each sequence of rtl components is read rtl, in the same way as each
   sequence of rtl words in an ltr text is read rtl.

   Example 5: Example 2, applied to components of different kinds:
   Logical representation (BN): "http://ab.cd.EF/GH/ij/kl.html"
   Visual representation (BN): "http://ab.cd.HG/FE/ij/kl.html"
   The inversion of the domain name label and the path component may be
   unexpected, but it is consistent with other bidi behavior.  For
   reassurance that the domain component really is "ab.cd.EF", it may be
   helpful to read aloud the visual representation following the Unicode
   Bidirectional Algorithm.  After "http://ab.cd." one reads the RTL
   block "E-F-slash-G-H", which corresponds to the logical

Internet-Draft             Bidi IRI Guidelines              October 2012


   representation.

   Example 6: Same as Example 5, with more rtl components:
   Logical representation (BN): "http://ab.CD.EF/GH/IJ/kl.html"
   Visual representation (BN): "http://ab.JI/HG/FE.DC/kl.html"
   The inversion of the domain name labels and the path components may
   be easier to identify because the delimiters also move.

   Example 7: A single rtl component includes digits:
   Logical representation (BN): "http://ab.CDE123FGH.ij/kl/mn/op.html"
   Visual representation (BN): "http://ab.HGF123EDC.ij/kl/mn/op.html"
   Numbers are written ltr in all cases but are treated as an additional
   embedding inside a run of rtl characters.  This is completely
   consistent with usual bidirectional text.

   Example 8 (not allowed): Numbers are at the start or end of an rtl
   component:
   Logical representation (BN): "http://ab.cd.ef/GH1/2IJ/KL.html"
   Visual representation (BN): "http://ab.cd.ef/LK/JI1/2HG.html"
   The sequence "1/2" is interpreted by the Bidirectional Algorithm as a
   fraction, fragmenting the components and leading to confusion.  There
   are other characters that are interpreted in a special way close to
   numbers; in particular, "+", "-", "#", "$", "%", ",", ".", and ":".

   Example 9 (not allowed): The numbers in the previous example are
   percent-encoded:
   Logical representation (BN): "http://ab.cd.ef/GH%31/%32IJ/KL.html"
   Visual representation (BN): "http://ab.cd.ef/LK/JI%32/%31HG.html"

   Example 10 (allowed but not recommended):
   Logical representation (BN): "http://ab.CDEFGH.123/kl/mn/op.html"
   Visual representation (BN): "http://ab.123.HGFEDC/kl/mn/op.html"
   Components consisting of only numbers are allowed (it would be rather
   difficult to prohibit them), but these may interact with adjacent RTL
   components in ways that are not easy to predict.

   Example 11 (allowed but not recommended):
   Logical representation (BN): "http://ab.CDEFGH.123ij/kl/mn/op.html"
   Visual representation (BN): "http://ab.123.HGFEDCij/kl/mn/op.html"
   Components consisting of numbers and left-to-right characters are
   allowed, but these may interact with adjacent RTL components in ways
   that are not easy to predict.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no changes to IANA registries.

7.  Security Considerations

   Confusion can occur with bidirectional IRIs, if the restrictions in
   Section 3 are not followed.  The same visual representation may be
   interpreted as different logical representations, and vice versa.  It
   is also very important that a correct Unicode bidirectional
   implementation be used.

Appendix A.  List of ASCII Symbols and their Bidirectional Character
             Types

   To help understand the influence of various symbols on IRI display,
   this appendix lists all of them, giving the character itself, the
   Unicode codepoint, the character name, the bidirectional character
   type (BCT) and the rule and relevance in the IRI syntax.

   The most important ones in practice are ":", delimining schem and
   port (CS, Common Number Separator), "/" to indicate generic
   (hierarchical) schemes and as a path separator (CS, Common Number
   Separator), "?" to introduce a query part (ON, Other Neutral), "#" to
   introduce a fragment identifier (ET, European Number Terminator), "."
   to separate labels in a domain name (CS, Common Number Separator),
   "&" to separate form parameters (ON, Other Neutral), and "@" to
   separate user information (ON, Other Neutral).
