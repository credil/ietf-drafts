     Abstract 

     SRLGs play a key role in routing resiliency and capacity planning of 
     multi-domain and multi-layer networks. Notion of SRLG are used to select a 
     backup path that is disjoint from the primary path, to ensure disjointness 
     of circuits and to avoid catastrophic partitioning outages.  

     In the current specifications, SRLG is identified as a 32 bit number that 
     is unique within an IGP domain [RFC4202]. There are many limitations to 
     this approach of encoding SRLGs, especially in a multi-layer network. This 
     draft outlines these limitations and suggests components of extended SRLG 
     encoding scheme to address them.

     1. Introduction 

        [RFC4202] defines notion of Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG). OSPF and IS-IS 
        extension for flooding SRLGs are defined in [RFC4203] and [RFC5307], 
        respectively. RSVP-TE signaling extensions for SRLG exclusion and recording 
        are defined in [RFC4874] and [DRAFT-SRLG-RECORDING], respectively.  

        In current specifications, SRLG is identified as a 32 bit number that is 
        unique within an IGP domain. There are many limitations to this approach for 
        encoding SRLGs, especially in multi-domain and multi-layer networks. Section2 
        outlines these restrictions and states the associated requirements. Section 3 
        outlines components of the extended SRLG encoding format to address these 
        requirements. The extended SRLG encoding format and the associated protocols 
        extension(s) are intentionally left for a future version/ companion 
        document(s). 

     2. Requirements  

        The section outlines the requirements for extending SRLG beyond an IGP domain 
        scoped 32 bit number. Some of these requirements are also noted in [DRAFT-
        SRLG-INFERENCE].  

     2.1. SRLG Scaling  

        A zealous operator could assign an SRLG for each risk, including (but not 
        limited to) a building, a floor of a building, a bridge, a side of a rail-
        track, a side of a highway, and an amplifier. This operator could easily have 
        hundreds of SRLGs for Label Switch Paths (LSPs) transiting domain it operates. 
        Similarly, there are technologies (e.g., DWDM) where it is possible to have 
        hundreds of SRLGs associated with LSPs using such underlying technology.  

        This presents a scaling issue with operations of the network, e.g., during 
        constrained-based path computation of intra-domain LSPs. This also presents a 
        scaling issue when such networks are used in multi-domain and multi-layer 
        environment, e.g., in IP over DWDM network, there may be hundreds of SRLGs 
        along a given IP/ MPLS link (inherited from underlying DWDM LSP). It may not 
        scale for the IP/ MPLS layer to learn hundreds of SRLGs per link and flood 
        them into its IGP database. This may impact flooding speed, topology database 
        size and especially constrained-based path computation complexity and 
        performance.  

        In the light of the above, finding mechanism(s) to scale SRLG is a requirement 
        for GMPLS networks, especially in inter-domain/ inter-layer environment.

     2.2. Global SRLG Identification  

        Currently SRLGs are defined and supported within domains. This limits the 
        usefulness of SRLGs in an inter-domain environment, as elaborated in the 
        following cases.  

        -  There are cases where two different Service Providers (SPs) may be sharing 
          the same fate (facility) for TE links within domains administrated by them. 
          For example, if a client Service Provider SP-C leases two LSPs LSP1 and 
          LSP2 respectively from two server SPs SP-S1 and SP-S2 who themselves lease 
          fibers from the same submarine duct, the SP-C would like to know when the 
          two LSPs LSP1 and LSP2 share the same submarine risk. With current 
          definition of SRLGs this is not possible. This is because SP-S1 uses an 
          SRLG numbering completely independent from SP-S2. For example, SP-S1 might 
          identify the submarine risk as SRLG23 while SP-S2 identifies it as SRLG47. 
          Even if client SP (SP-C) is able to discover SRLGs along LSP1 and LSP2 
          (e.g., using SRLG recording [DRAFT-SRLG-RECORDING] SP-C learns that the 
          LSP1 is exposed to SRLG23 and LSP2 exposed to SRLG47), the SP-C problem is 
          not resolved: it has no way to know that LSP1 and LSP2 are actually sharing 
          the same risk.  

        -  If SP-C in the above example would like to request LSP2 to be SRLG diverse 
          from LSP1 using SRLG recording [DRAFT-SRLG-RECORDING] and SRLG XRO/ EXRS 
          [RFC4874], there is no guarantee that LSP2 route is SRLG diverse. This is 
          because knowing that LSP1 is exposed to SRLG23, SP-C cannot realize a path 
          from SP-S2 which is disjoint from SRLG23 of SP-S1 (as SRLG23 means 
          something else for SP-S2). Similarly, SRLG inclusion also does not work 
          using the current SRLG encoding scheme.  

        -  At present, SRLG administration is completely up to the SPs. Therefore, 
          SRLG values in an inter-domain environment may collide. Considering the 
          above example, SP-S1 may have assigned SRLG12 to a resource used by LSP1, 
          whereas client SP-C may already be using SRLG12 to identify a different 
          resource in its network. Even though these two resources may not share any 
          risk, they are not SRLG diverse (assumed to share risk in GMPLS control 
          plane).  

        In the light of the above, finding mechanism(s) to maintain consistency of 
        SRLG in an inter-domain environment is a requirement.  

     2.3. Risk Management 

        Not all resources in a network have same level of availability. Some resources 
        are more prone to failures, e.g., a fiber trunk running close to utility wires 
        is more likely to suffer from accidental cuts than a fiber trunk running in 
        isolation. Metro links are more susceptible to cuts than rural links, and 
        aerial fiber is susceptible to storm induced outages.

        Consider the example where a client Service Provider (SP) SP-C leases LSP1 
        from server SP (SP-S1). Availability of LSP1 is typically part of service 
        level agreement (SLA) between SP-C and SP-S1, e.g., SP-C may request 99.999% 
        (five-nines) of availability. Given high availability requirement for LSP1, 
        SP-S1 needs to route LSP1 such that it uses resources with better than 99.999% 
        availability. Furthermore, given a set of underlying resources, SP1 should 
        also be able to estimate availability of LSP1 connection. How availability of 
        a connection given availability of its underlying resources is estimated is 
        beyond the scope of this document but, if availability is represented as a 
        number between 0 and 1, a multiply function can be used for this calculation.   

        In the light of the above, finding mechanism(s) to quantify risk associated 
        with a resource is a requirement.  

     3. Components of Extended SRLG 

        This section outline components that form basis for extended SRLG encoding 
        scheme.  
       
     3.1. SRLG Filtration  

        A way to address SRLG scaling requirement mentioned in Section 2 is to 
        associate a priority field to the SRLG and use it as a mechanism to observe 
        SRLG filtering. For example, in a multi-layer network, only higher priority 
        SRLGs may be requested or exposed to the client layer. Alternatively, the 
        client may request all the SRLG's from the server and store them locally in 
        its SRLG database but only flood in its client control-plane (ISIS, OSPF) the 
        more important (higher priority) SRLG's.  

        Examining a resource type associated with an SRLG may also be used to filter 
        SRLG information in multi-domain/ multi-layer networks. E.g., SP-S1 may not 
        export SRLGs of amplifiers used along path of LSP1 to the client SP (SP-C) 
        running IP services. This document suggests characterization of the following 
        resource types:  

        -  Optical section: A fiber that connects two optical NEs(e.g., amplifiers). 
          Also termed OTS in ITU parlance. 

        -  Optical line: A fiber that connects two optical switching elements (e.g., 
          ROADMs). Also termed OMS in ITU parlance. 

        -  Optical path: an optical connection that connects two client ports, e.g., a 
          port P1 on node N1 to a port P2 on node N2. Also termed Och Connection in 
          ITU parlance. 

        -  Fiber Duct: Conduit carrying fibers (which represent optical sections).

     ID            draft-ali-ccamp-extended-srlg-00.txt 
         

        -  Building: Building hosting multiple network elements, and represents a 
          common risk, e.g., during a terror attack. Such a building may host both 
          transport and client gear. 

        -  Optical NE: Amplifier, ROADM or other optical NE used along an optical TE 
          link.  

        -  Power feed: a common power source feeding multiple NEs 

        -  Geographic region: an area susceptible to a disaster such as earthquake or 
          flood. 

        -  More may be added in future revision(s).  

     3.2. Globally Unique SRLGs 

        A way to address global uniqueness of the SRLG is to associate Autonomous 
        System (AS) number of the AS that originated the SRLG value.  

     3.3. SRLG Risk Management 

        Risk management requirements are discussed in section 2. As SRLGs are used to 
        characterize resources, associating a resource availability field to the SRLG 
        can satisfy risk management requirements. Specifically, availability of a 
        resource as defined in the following can be used for this purpose. 

           Availability = MTBF/(MTBF+MTTR), where 

           MTBF is mean time between failures of the resource, 

           MTTR is mean time to repair a failure of the resource.   

     4. Extended SRLG Encoding  

        Motivation for this version is to discuss components of SRLG and hence the 
        extended SRLG encoding is intentionally left for a future revision. 
        Nonetheless the idea is to augment the currently defined 32-bit Shared Risk 
        Link Group Value with the following parameters:  

            o SRLG priority. 
            o Type of the SRLG resource. 
            o Availability of the SRLG SRLG resource. 
            o SRLG Originator's AS Number.

     5. Protocols extensions for extended SRLG Encoding 

        Extension(s) for protocols that use SRLG values for their operations (e.g., 
        OSPF, ISIS, RSVP-TE, PCE, etc.) are to be added in future version of this 
        document or companion document(s).  

     6. Security Considerations 

        Security considerations related to the extended-SRLG encoding are left 
        for future revision of the document.  

     7. IANA Considerations 

        This version of the document does not require any IANA considerations.  

     8. Acknowledgments 

        Authors would like to acknowledge valuable feedback from many service 
        providers. Individual acknowledgements will be added in future version
