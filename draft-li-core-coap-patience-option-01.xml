      <t>
      CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and
      networks. This specification provides a simple extension for 
      CoAP, the Patience Option. This Option informs a recipient of the preferred time frame for a 
      request or response depending on usage context. In a unicast request, it indicates the patience 
      a client has in waiting for a response. The CoAP server tries to return 
      the response within the specified time frame. In a multicast request, 
      it indicates the patience a server should have in sending its response. 
      The recipient would then try to randomly delay its response within the time frame
       that the requester indicated or computed by the recipient itself. 
	   In a CoAP observe notification, it indicates the patience an
       observer should have in both waiting for a subsequent notification and in 
       re-establishing an observation relation.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        This specification adds a new option Patience to CoAP <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap" />. 
        The main purpose is for the requester to inform the recipient of the preferred time frame for a
        response. In the unicast request case, it is used to indicate the patience it has in waiting for
        a response. It then indicates "a response is most 
        useful within the specified time frame". In the multicast request case, it 
        indicates the patience that a server should have in sending a response.
        In other words, it indicates "if possible please delay your response 
        by a randomly chosen time within the specified time frame".          
        A second purpose is for use by a server when sending CoAP observe <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-observe" />
        notifications, to indicate the maximum time an observer should wait (i.e. patience
        of the observer) before starting any observation relationship recovery.
      </t>
      
      <section anchor="just" title="Justification">
        <t>
          In the unicast case, it is useful for the requester (client) to indicate that 
          the response is required to be returned within a certain amount of time. 
          For example, the requester could require a response within 2 seconds, 
          otherwise the response is not of interest anymore.           
          With this indication of the patience for a response, 
          the requester knows how long it should wait for the response, and it 
          needs to keep the state of the request only for the indicated 
          time. After this period, the request will be given up. It can avoid that 
          the recipient wastes resources by sending a 
          response which already exceeds the set patience timeout of the requester.        
        </t>
        <t>
          In the multicast case, if a server does decide to respond to a multicast 
		  request, it should not respond immediately.  Instead, it should pick a 
		  duration for the period of time during which it intends to respond.  
		  For purposes of this exposition, we call the length of this period the 
		  Leisure. In <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-observe" />, how to compute the
		  a rough lower bound for Leisure is specified, and the DEFAULT_LEISURE is 
          also defined. A Patience option, if present, can be used
          as an upper bound for the Leisure.   		  
        </t>
        <t>
          TODO: If the indication of client patience, which is currently only 
          defined for
          unicast CoAP requests, would also be required for multicast CoAP requests,
          an alternative to the solution provided in this document is to define two 
          types of Patience Option to be able
          to express client patience and server patience separately.
        </t>
        <t>
         In an observe scenario, it is useful for a server to indicate to an observer that, 
         after the period of time in the Max-Age option has expired, a new notification will be sent
         within the time interval indicated by the Patience option. The server may use this to 
          send notifications with a dithered delay i.e. randomly chosen within the Patience-specified
           time interval, when there are many CoAP clients simultaneously observing a resource on the server,
           avoiding network congestion issues. Another use is for the server to delay sending a new
           notification because e.g. the resource has not changed. The observer in this case can
           assume that the server will do its best to deliver a notification at least before the Patience
           time interval runs out.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the Patience option is combined with Observe option in a request,
          currently it indicates the maximum time an observer is prepared to wait for an 
          initial notification.

        The minimum non-zero patience time is 8ms, when TX=0, T=1 and a milliseconds

      <section anchor="Usage" title="Using the Patience Option">
      		<t>
      		The semantics of the Patience Option depends on its usage context, 
      		as detailed in below sections.
      		</t>
         <section anchor="Unicast" title="Unicast usage">
            <t>
            In the unicast case, this option is used by a CoAP client to indicate 
            the maximum time a requester is prepared to wait for a response. 
            </t>   
 
            <t>
            The requester adds the Patience option to any request 
            for which it is prepared to wait for a response.  
            The requester sets the option to the maximum time that it is 
            prepared to wait.
            </t>
      
           <t>The Patience option applies to both piggy-backed response 
           and separate response. For a separate response, the patience 
           applies to the actual response after the ACK. ACK should 
           be sent immediately upon receipt of the CON message.
           </t>
           
           <t>
           TBD: In case a requester retransmits a request, the Patience Option value 
           MAY be decreased by an amount of time equivalent to the time since the 
           previous transmission attempt.  In case a requester did not receive
            an ACK to a confirmable request and a time interval of at least the 
            interval indicated in the Patience Option of the request has passed, 
            the requester SHOULD give up the request.
           </t>
           
            <t>
           The recipient interprets this option as the maximum time between receipt
           of the complete request and the time that it begins
           sending the response.  
           The requester will observe a longer time interval
           between request and response, as network transit and processing by
           proxies add delays.
           If timing is critical, 
           the requester SHOULD consider the possible delays and choose the value
            for the option accordingly.
           </t>

           <t>
           The recipient MAY apply a lower value to the patience timeout based on
           local policy.  A recipient MAY choose to take longer to produce
           a response, at the risk that the requester is no longer able to use the
           response.
           </t>
 
           <t>
           In case that the CoAP message is transmitted through a proxy, 
           the Proxy MAY reduce the value of a Patience option
           based on a local policy (e.g. to consider the maximum time that
            an idle connection is kept open by a local NAT or Firewall).  
           A Proxy MAY add a Patience
           option if none is present.  The value in the Patience option
           MUST NOT be increased or removed.
           </t>

            <t>
            If the requester does not receive a response 
            within the indicated response time, the requester SHOULD consider the 
            request as failed.   
            If the recipient can't provide a response within the required time, the
            recipient SHOULD discard the request.  
            </t>    
            
            <t>
            This option is "elective".  It MUST NOT occur more than once.

          <section anchor="Multicast" title="Multicast usage">
              <t>
              In the multicast case, Leisure is defined in

			  the period of time during which a server intends to respond to a

          <section anchor="Observer" title="Observe usage">
            <t>
            In a CoAP observe <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-observe" /> scenario, 
            the Patience Option MAY be used in a notification 
            to indicate the maximum time an observer should wait before starting any 
            observation relationship recovery.
            </t>
            <t>
            The Max-Age Option indicates the maximum time a response (notification) may be cached 
            before it MUST be considered stale. The Max-Age Option of a notification
             is usually set to a value that estimates when the server will send the 
             next notification. However, in the case the value has not changed, 
             the server can decide not to send a new notification, possibly confusing the 
             observer. It is quite difficult for an observer to 
             discriminate the situation that it has not received a new notification 
             because the value has not changed from situations where the server 
             has lost its state, or for some reason has given up on notification delivery.
            </t>
            <t>
            The Patience Option in a notification is used to indicate the maximum
             time a server will try to reach the client before giving up. This is
			 to save the client some effort in re-establishing observation
             relationships each time max-age is reached.  
             This option is also useful to give a server the time to send out
              the notifications, in case there are many CoAP clients observing 
              simultaneously a resource, while avoiding network congestion issues.
              </t>
             <t>
           The server adds the Patience option to any notification related to an 
           observation relationship from which it wants delay an observation refresh
            request made by the observer. The server sets the option to the maximum time that it is prepared
             to spend to reach the observer before giving up.
             </t>
             <t>
            The observer interprets this option as the minimum time between the expiration
             of a notification (as indicated by its Max-Age Option value) and the moment it 
             MAY start an observation relationship recovery action with the server.
            </t>
            <t>
            If the observer does not receive a response within the indicated time 
            interval, the observer SHOULD attempt to re-establish the observation relationship 
            with the server if it is still interested in observing the particular resource.
            </t> 
			<t>
              This option is "elective".  It MUST NOT occur more than once.

         <section anchor="Detection" title="Detection of IP unicast or multicast CoAP request">
           <t>
            A single Patience Option, used to indicate potentially either client 
            patience (in the IP unicast case) or server patience (in the IP multicast case), 
            requires that a CoAP server is able to distinguish between IP unicast 
            and multicast requests. If there exist commonly used IP stacks that 
            do not offer such functionality [to be checked], requiring servers to 
            be able to make the unicast/multicast distinction seems unwise and 
            limits the applicability of the Patience Option.
            </t>
            
            <t>
            Approaches for a CoAP server to detect unicast versus multicast
             requests may include: 
             </t>
             
             <t>
             1) CoAP server application opens a specific socket and sets IP 
             multicast reception using the POSIX setsockopt function [to be 
             verified if IP unicast traffic also is received in this case, 
             or not].
             </t>
             
             <t>
             2) CoAP server checks the IP destination address of incoming 
             packets. If this has the FF00::/8 IPv6 prefix, then it's treated
              as multicast otherwise unicast [to be verified if IP stack APIs
               allow to get IP destination].
             </t>
             
             <t>  
             3) Receiving CoAP multicast requests always occurs on a different 
             port than the standard CoAP port. For example, similar to 
             coaps:// that uses a different port than coap://, a scheme 
             coapm:// on a different port may be defined for multicast requests.

      <t>
        This section gives a short example with a message flow that 
        illustrates the use of the Patience option in an Observe 
        notification.

      <t>
         This example (<xref target="ObserveExample"/>) shows that the 
         server wants the observer to wait 819 seconds (T=25, TX=3) 
         before starting any observation relationship recovery, even though
         the Max-Age of the temperature value notification is only 120 seconds.
