        Definitions of Managed Objects for BGP Origin Validation
                draft-ymbk-bgp-origin-validation-mib-00

Abstract

   This document extends the current Management Information Base (MIB)
   defined for BGP in RFC 4273 to provide support for BGP Origin
   Validation.  In particular, it describes manage objects used for
   managing BGP Origin validation state within BGP protocol.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document will required an IANA assigned OBJECT
   IDENTIFIER within the SMI Numbers registry.  For example, replacing
   XXX below:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------
         bgpOrigVal            { mib-2 XXX }


7.  Security Considerations

   This extension to [RFC4273] does not change the underlying security
   issues inherent in the existing BGP and [RFC4273].
