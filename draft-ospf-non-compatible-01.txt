    Extensions to OSPF facilitating the deployment of non-backward-
                          compatible changes.
                      draft-ospf-non-compatible-01

Abstract

   This document specifies a generic mechanism that facilitates the
   deployment of non-backward-compatible changes in OSPF protocol.  This
   mechanism allows the OSPF routers to advertise the capability of non-
   backward-compatible functionality and to make the functionality
   operational only when supported by all participating routers.
   Depending on the functionality scope, capability advertisements must
   be propagated across a link, area or autonomous system (AS).  For
   link and area scope functionality, Router Information Link State
   Advertisement (LSA) is utilized to propagate the capability
   information.  For the cases when compatibility must be maintained
   across the whole OSPF autonomous system, new Area Information (AI)
   LSA is introduced.  The AI LSA is a TLV-based analog of Indication-
   LSA that is used for demand circuit functionality and described in
   RFC1793.

Internet-Draft        OSPF Non-Backward-Compatible         February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The evolution of OSPF protocol brought up changes that are not
   backward-compatible.  Some of those changes (for example
   RFC1583Compatibility flag) can cause a routing loop in mixed
   environments.  It therefore requires careful deployment planning,
   which is difficult to achieve in complex multivendor topologies.
   Most importantly, the lack of standard extendable mechanism that
   facilitates the deployment of non-backward-compatible changes
   obstructs the development of new protocol extensions.

   As a solution for the above described problems, this document
   proposes an extendable mechanism, which guarantees that the non-
   backward-compatible functionality is turned on only when supported by
   all participating routers.

   The proposed mechanism is not new; the existing demand circuit
   functionality [DEMAND] uses the same approach.  This document simply
   makes the solution generic.


2.  Method to deploy non-backward-compatible changes

   Each participating router advertises the capability of functionality
   that it supports in the Router Information LSA as described in RFC
   4970 [OSPF-CAP].  Routers only turn on a new functionality when it is
   supported by every router within the functionality scope.  The
   routers revert back to their original behavior as soon as one
   incompatible device is detected.

   The scope of functionality could be link, area or AS wide.  For link
   and area wide, the router accordingly originates a link or area scope
   RI LSA.  For AS functionality, an area scope RI LSA is used.  To
   propagate compatibility information across area borders, a new LSA
   type Area Information is introduced.


3.  Area Information LSA

   The Area Border Router inserts a particular capability TLV into an
   Area Information (AI) LSA to signal that at least one router in the
   attached areas does not support the functionality.  Therefore, the
   presence of a particular TLV in AI LSA signals the opposite case to
   the presence of the same TLV in RI LSA.  The AI LSA origination
   algorithm is very similar to the algorithm of Indication-LSA
   origination [DEMAND] and outlined below in Section 3.4.  The AI LSA
   format is very similar to RI LSA [OSPF-CAP].  In OSPFv2, the AI LSA
   will be implemented with a new opaque LSA type ID.  In OSPFv3, the AI

   LSA will be implemented with a new LSA type function code.  In both
   protocols, the AI LSA will have an area flooding scope.  The exact
   format of AI LSA is outlined in the sections 3.1 and 3.2.

3.1.  OSPFv2 Area Information (AI) Opaque LSA

   OSPFv2 routers will advertise an area-scoped Opaque-LSA [OPAQUE].
   The OSPFv2 Area Information LSA has a Link-State type of 10
   indicating that the flooding scope is area-local, an Opaque type of
   TBD and Opaque ID of 0.

                    OSPFv2 Area Information Opaque LSA


   The format of the TLVs within the body of an AI LSA is defined in
   Section 3.3.

3.2.  OSPFv3 Area Information (AI) LSA

   The OSPFv3 Area Information LSA has a function code of TBD while the
   S1/S2 bits are set to 1/0, indicating the area flooding scope for the
   LSA.

   The U bit is set indicating that the OSPFv3 AI LSA should be flooded
   even if it is not understood.  The Link State ID (LSID) value for
   this LSA is 0.  This is unambiguous since an OSPFv3 router will only
   advertise a single AI LSA per flooding scope.

                       OSPFv3 Area Information LSA


   The format of the TLVs within the body of an AI LSA is defined in
   Section 3.3.

3.3.  Area Information LSA TLV format

   The format of the TLVs within the body of an AI LSA is exactly the
   same as the corresponding RI LSA TLV format, which in turn is the
   same as the format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF
   [TE].  The LSA payload consists of one or more nested Type/Length/
   Value (TLV) triplets.  The format of each TLV is:


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |              Type             |             Length            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                            Value...                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                TLV Format


   The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets
   (thus a TLV with no value portion would have a length of 0).  The TLV
   is padded to a 4-octet alignment; padding is not included in the
   length field (so a 3-octet value would have a length of 3, but the
   total size of the TLV would be 8 octets).  Nested TLVs are also 32-



Dubrovsky, et al.        Expires August 19, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        OSPF Non-Backward-Compatible         February 2013


   bit aligned.  For example, a 1-byte value would have the length field
   set to 1, and 3 octets of padding would be added to the end of the
   value portion of the TLV.  Unrecognized types are ignored.

   When new Area Information LSA TLV is defined, the specification MUST
   explicitly state whether the TLV is applicable to OSPFv2 only, OSPFv3
   only, or both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

3.4.  Area Information LSA origination

   Through the origination of AI LSAs, information about the existence
   of incapable routers propagates from non-backbone areas, to the
   backbone area and from there to all other areas.  The following two
   cases summarize the requirements for an area border router to
   originate AI LSAs:

   1.  Suppose an area border router (Router X) is connected to a non-
   backbone OSPF area (Area A).  Furthermore, assume that Area A has an
   incapable router i.e. a router LSA without corresponding RI LSA TLV.
   Then Router X should originate the AI LSAs into all other directly
   connected areas, including the backbone area, in accordance with the
   guidelines of Section 3.4.1.

   2.  Suppose an area border router (Router X) is connected to the
   backbone OSPF area (Area 0.0.0.0).  Furthermore, assume that the
   backbone has an indication of an existing incapable device via either

   a) the existence of a router LSA without corresponding RI LSA TLV

   or

   b) AI LSAs that have been originated by routers other than Router X.
   Then Router X should originate AI LSAs into all other directly
   connected non-backbone areas, keeping the guidelines of Section 3.4.1
   in mind.

3.4.1.  Limiting Area Information LSA origination

   The following guidelines should be observed by an area border router
   (Router X) when originating AI LSAs in order to limit their number.
   First, AI LSAs with corresponding TLV are not originated into an Area
   A when A has incapable routers; i.e. router LSAs without
   corresponding RI LSA TLV.  Secondly, if another area border router
   has originated an AI LSA with corresponding TLV into Area A, and that
   area border router has a higher OSPF Router ID than Router X (same
   tie-breaker as for forwarding the address origination; see Section
   12.4.4.1 of [OSPF]), then Router X should not originate an AI LSA
   with corresponding TLV into Area A.

Internet-Draft        OSPF Non-Backward-Compatible         February 2013


4.  RI LSA coupling with Router-LSA

   RI LSA is essentially an extension to the router-lsa that overcomes
   it's extendability limitations.  In some scenarios there will be a
   requirement to ensure that the latest versions of both LSAs are
   received before further processing of the pair.  Therefore we need a
   mechanism to couple the two LSAs together.

   A new X-bit from the OSPF Options Field is introduced to signal to
   wait for the RI LSA arrival before processing the router-lsa.  When
   the X-bit is set in a router-lsa, the lsa won't be further processed
   until the corresponding RI LSA with the same LS sequence number
   becomes available.


5.  Capability negotiation before adjacency is fully formed

   For negotiating link scope capability before adjacency is fully
   formed, link local signaling [LLS] should be used instead of RI LSA.
   An example of such a functionality would be a modification to OSPF
   adjacency formation FSM.


6.  Backward Compatibility

   The mechanism is backward compatible with the existing OSPF
   specification.  Setting the U bit in OSPFv3 AI LSA allows LSA
   propagation even if some routers in the area can not decode the LSA
   content.  The Opaque LSA specification [OPAQUE] also guarantees the
   propagation of OSPFv2 AI LSA, even if the content is not understood
   by some of the transit routers.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The following IANA assignments are to be made from existing
   registries:

   The OSPFv2 opaque LSA option type TBD will need to be reserved for
   the OSPFv2 AI opaque LSA via IETF Consensus.

   OSPFv3 LSA Function Codes TBD will need to be reserved for the OSPFv3
   Area Information (AI) LSA via Standards Action.

   IANA allocated X-bit in the "OSPFv2 Options Registry" and "OSPFv3
   Options Registry" as per Section 4.

   Both Standards Action and IETF Consensus registration procedures are

   described in the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-
   rfc2434bis].


8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a generic mechanism for deployment of non-
   backward-compatible changes and it introduces Area-Information LSA
   for AS scope compatibility.  The security considerations for those
   entities are as critical as the topology information currently
   advertised by the base OSPF protocol.  Security considerations for
   the base OSPF protocol are covered in [OSPF] and [OSPFV3].
