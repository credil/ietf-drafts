1.  Introduction

   A debate on stateless solutions, for residual IPv4 service across
   IPv6-only networks, is in the agenda of the Softwire interim meeting
   on 2011/09/26-27.  This document proposes a tool to facilitate common
   understanding during these discussions.  It is intended to contribute
   to the decision-making process when time comes to decide what to
   standardize.

   It contains tables in which, for each of the major proposed
   solutions, the most significant differentiating functional features
   are listed.

   Separate tables are proposed for:

   o  features that depend on how port-sets of shared IPv4 addresses are
      specified;

   o  features that depend on how IPv6 destination addresses used to
      traverse IPv6 networks are constructed;

   o  features that depend on whether IPv4 packets are encapsulated or
      twice translated.

   For each table, discussion can be in two steps:

   1.  get common enough understanding of each functional feature;

   2.  Check that authors of each proposed solution agree on what
       applies to their solutions, with caveats if appropriate.

   After that, a discussion on which solution(s) the WG recommends to
   standardize should be more effective.

   There is no claim that the current state of these tables is
   exhaustive, or that it reflects an accurate understanding of all
   solutions.  It is proposed only as a temporary tool for the meeting.
   Clarification questions and proposed amendments are naturally
   welcome.

   Wojciech Dec et al.[1] and Mohamed Boucadair [2] have analyzed with
   more details several solutions covered above.  Their drafts have been
   quite helpful to prepare these tables.  Nejc Skoberne has shared on
   the WG list an early comparison table which usefully influenced this
   work [3].  Also, Alain Durand expressed interest to have this type of
   tools in I-D format.  Thanks to all of them.
