1.  Introduction

   The Zlib [RFC1950] and gzip [RFC1952] formats are widely used
   compression formats.  Zlib is a stream format, while gzip adds header
   and trailer fields more appropriate for a file format.  Both
   implement the DEFLATE compression scheme described in [RFC1951].

Internet-Draft         Media types zlib and gzip              April 2012


   They are used to compress a wide variety of material, from
   unstructured text to structured data to executable code.

   Some applications have informally used media types including
   application/gzip-compressed, application/gzipped, application/
   x-gunzip, application/x-gzip, application/x-gzip-compressed, and gzip
   /document to describe data compressed with gzip.  The media types
   defined in this document should replace those media types in future
   applications.

2.  The Application/Zlib Media Type

   The application/zlib media type describes a block of data that is
   compressed using Zlib [RFC1950] compression.  The data is a stream of
   bytes as described in RFC 1950.

2.1.  Registration Details

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: zlib

   Required parameters: N/A

   Optional parameters: N/A

   Encoding considerations: needs base64 or other encoding that allows
   arbitrary binary data

   Security considerations: See section [security] below

   Interoperability considerations: N/A

   Published specification: [RFC1950]

   Applications that use this media type: anywhere data size is an issue

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): first byte is usually 0x78 but can also be 0x08,
      0x18, 0x28, 0x38, 0x48, 0x58, or 0x68.
      File extension(s): N/A
      Macintosh file type code(s): N/A

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage: N/A

3.  The Application/Gzip Media Type

   The application/gzip media type describes a block of data that is
   compressed using gzip [RFC1952] compression.  The data is a stream of
   bytes as described in RFC 1952.

3.1.  Registration Details

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: gzip

   Required parameters: N/A

   Optional parameters: N/A

   Encoding considerations: needs base64 or other encoding that allows
   arbitrary binary data

   Security considerations: See section [security] below

   Interoperability considerations: N/A

   Published specification: [RFC1952]

   Applications that use this media type: anywhere data size is an issue

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): first two bytes are 0x1f, 0x8b.
      File extension(s): gz
      Macintosh file type code(s): N/A

   Person and email address to contact for further information: see
   http://www.gzip.org/

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage: N/A

4.  Security Considerations

   Zlib and gzip compression can be used to compress arbitrary binary
   data such as hostile executable code.  Also, data that purports to be
   in zlib or gzip format may not be, and fields that are supposed to be
   flags, lengths, or pointers, could contain anything.  Applications
   should treat any data with due skepticism.

   Also see the security considerations in the underlying format
   documents, Section 5 of [RFC1950], Section 6 of [RFC1951], and
   Section 4 of [RFC1952].
