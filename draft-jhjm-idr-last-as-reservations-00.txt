                Last Autonomous System (AS) Reservations
                 draft-jhjm-idr-last-as-reservations-00

Abstract

   This document reserves two Autonomous System numbers (ASNs) at the
   end of the 16 bit and 32 bit ranges, described in this document as
   "Last ASNs" and recommends they not be used by operators.

Internet-Draft            Last AS Reservations                  May 2013


1.  Introduction

   IANA has reserved the last Autonomous System Number (ASN), 65535, of
   the 16 bit autonomous system number range for over a decade with the
   intention that it not be used by BGP [RFC4271] network operators.
   Since the introduction of BGP Support for Four-Octet AS Number Space
   [RFC6793], IANA has also reserved the ASN of the 32 bit autonomous
   system number range, 4294967295.  These reservations have been
   documented in the IANA Autonomous System Numbers Registry [IANA.AS].
   Although these "Last ASNs" border on Private Use ASN ranges, they are
   not defined as Private Use ASNs by
   [I-D.ietf-idr-as-private-reservation].  This document describes the
   reasoning for these reservations and provides guidance both to
   operators and to authors of future protocol enhancements on their
   use.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Reasons for Last ASN Reservations

   The primary reason for reserving the Last ASNs of the 16 bit and 32
   bit ASN ranges is that these numbers are also at the end of typical
   computational data structures holding the underlying number.
   Programmatic errors are more common when handling of end of range
   values, and sometimes last values (binary all ones) have been used as
   "magic numbers", to represent a different number or behavior.

   Secondly, a subset of the standard BGP communities of the last ASN of
   the 16 bit range, 65535, are reserved for use by Well-known
   communities as described in RFC 1997 [RFC1997] and IANA [IANA.WK].
   Although this not currently true of ASN 4294967295, if there is a
   future need for a Special Use ASN that is not designed to be globally
   routable, or the associated BGP attributes (such as communities) of
   such an ASN, this may be a valid candidate for such purpose.  This
   document does not prescribe any such purpose to this ASN.

4.  Operational Considerations

   Operators MUST NOT use Last ASNs as if they are Private Use ASNs, or
   for any other purpose, since they are reserved and implementations
   may have errors in regards to handling these ASNs.  Implementations
   SHOULD NOT handle Last ASNs in the same fashion as Private Use ASNs.
   Operators are accustomed to being able to fully utilize the
   communities associated with the ASN's they have deployed utilizing

   the format described in RFC 1997 [RFC1997], even in the case of
   Private Use ASNs.  In the case of usage of ASN 65535 as if it was a
   Private Use ASN, operators might not recognize these communities are
   reserved as BGP Well-known community values [IANA.WK], causing
   undesirable routing behavior if prefixes are tagged with such
   communities within the network.

   Operators that choose to filter or provide tools that filter AS_PATH,
   MAY choose to filter Last ASNs in the same way as Private Use ASNs,
   to prevent the use of these reserved ASNs on their networks.

5.  Acknowledgements

   The author would like to thank Michelle Cotton and Elwyn Davis for
   encouraging the proper documentation of the reservation of these
   ASNs.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has reserved Autonomous System number 65535 from the "16-bit
   Autonomous System Numbers" registry for the reasons described in this
   document.

   IANA has also reserved Autonomous System number 4294967295 from the
   "32-bit Autonomous System Numbers" registry for the reasons described
   in this document.

   These reservations have been documented in the IANA Autonomous System
   Numbers Registry [IANA.AS].

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any additional security concerns in
   regards to the Last ASNs usage.  Although the BGP protocol is
   designed to allow usage of these Last ASNs, security issues related
   to BGP implementation errors may be triggered by Last ASN usage.
