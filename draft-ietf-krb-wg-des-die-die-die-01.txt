Abstract

   The Kerberos 5 network authentication protocol, originally specified
   in RFC1510, can use the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for
   encryption.  Almost 30 years after first publishing DES, the National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) finally withdrew the
   standard in 2005, reflecting a long-established consensus that DES is
   insufficiently secure.  By 2008, commercial hardware costing less
   than USD 15,000 could break DES keys in less than a day on average.
   DES is long past its sell-by date.  Accordingly, this document
   updates RFC1964, RFC4120, and RFC4121 to deprecate the use of DES in
   Kerberos.  Because RFC1510 (obsoleted by RFC4120) supports only DES,
   this document also reclassifies RFC1510 as Historic.

1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The original specification of the Kerberos 5 network authentication
   protocol [RFC1510] supports only the Data Encryption Standard (DES)
   for encryption.  For many years, the cryptographic community has
   regarded DES as providing inadequate security.  Accordingly, this
   document reclassifies [RFC1510] (obsoleted by [RFC4120]) as Historic,
   and updates current Kerberos-related specifications [RFC1964],
   [RFC4120], and [RFC4121] to deprecate the use of DES in Kerberos.


3.  Affected specifications

   The original IETF specification of Kerberos 5 [RFC1510] only supports
   DES for encryption.  [RFC4120] obsoletes [RFC1510] and updates the
   Kerberos specification to include additional cryptographic
   algorithms, but still permits the use of DES.

   The specification of the Kerberos Generic Security Services
   Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) mechanism [RFC1964] and
   its updated version [RFC4121] define checksum and encryption
   mechanisms based on DES.  With the existence of newer encryption
   types for Kerberos GSS-API defined in [RFC4121], Microsoft's ARCFOUR-
   HMAC based GSS-API mechanism, and MIT's DES3, there is no need to
   support the old DES based integrity (SGN) and confidentiality (SEAL)
   types.


4.  DES insecurity

   The insecurity of DES has been evident for many years.  The National

   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) officially withdrew DES
   in 2005 [DES-Withdrawal], and also announced a transition period that
   ended on May 19, 2007 [DES-Transition-Plan].  The IETF has also
   published its position in [RFC4772], in which the recommendation
   summary is very clear: "don't use DES".

   In 2006, researchers demonstrated the ability to brute force a DES
   key in an average of less than 9 days using less than EUR 10,000
   worth of hardware [Break-DES].  By 2008, a company was offering
   hardware capable of breaking a DES key in less than a day on average
   [DES-1day] that cost less than USD 15,000 [DES-crack].  Brute force
   key searches of DES will only get faster and cheaper.  (The
   aforementioned company markets its device for one-click recovery of
   lost DES keys.)  It is clear that it is well past time to retire the
   use of DES in Kerberos.


5.  Recommendations

   This document hereby removes the following RECOMMENDED types from
   [RFC4120]:
      Encryption: DES-CBC-MD5(3)
      Checksums: DES-MD5 (8, named RSA-MD5-DES in [RFC3961]).

   Kerberos implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT implement the
   single DES encryption types: DES-CBC-CRC(1), DES-CBC-MD4(2), DES-CBC-
   MD5(3).

   Kerberos implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT implement the
   checksum types: CRC32(1), RSA-MD4(2), RSA-MD4-DES(3), DES-MAC(4),
   DES-MAC-K(5), RSA-MD4-MAC-K(6), RSA-MD5-DES(8).

   It is possible to safely use the RSA-MD5(7) checksum type, but only
   with additional protection, such as the protection that an encrypted
   Authenticator provides.  Implementations MAY use RSA-MD5 inside an
   encrypted Authenticator for backward compatibility with systems that
   do not support newer checksum types.  One example is that some legacy
   systems only support ARCFOUR-HMAC-MD5 for encryption when DES is not
   available; these systems use RSA-MD5 checksums inside Authenticators
   encrypted with ARCFOUR-HMAC-MD5.

   Kerberos GSS mechanism implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT
   implement the SGN ALG: DES MAC MD5(0000), MD2.5(0100), DES MAC(0200)
   (updates [RFC1964]).

   Kerberos GSS mechanism implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT
   implement the SEAL ALG: DES(0000) (updates [RFC1964]).

   The effect of the two last sentences is that this document deprecates
   section 1.2 in [RFC1964].

   This document hereby reclassifies [RFC1510] as Historic.


6.  Acknowledgements

   Jeffrey Hutzelman, Simon Josefsson, Mattias Amnefelt, Leif Johansson,
   and Ran Atkinson have read the document and provided suggestions for
   improvements.  Sam Hartman proposed moving [RFC1510] to Historic.


7.  Security Considerations

   Removing support for single DES improves security, because DES is
   considered to be insecure.

   Kerberos defines some encryption types that are either underspecified
   or that only have number assignments but no specifications.
   Implementations should make sure that they only implement and enable
   secure encryption types.

   RC4, used in ARCFOUR-HMAC, is considered weak; however, the use in
   Kerberos is vetted and considered secure for now.  The main reason to
   not actively discourage the use of ARCFOUR-HMAC is that it is the
   only encryption type that interoperates with older versions of
   Microsoft Windows once DES is removed.


8.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA Considerations for this document.
