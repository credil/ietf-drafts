      This document defines extensions to RTSP 2.0 protocol, including 
      header "Substream", feature tag "Play.substream" , and related new status codes.
      These extensions enables the playback control of a media stream on substream basis.

      <t>
         Single Session Transmission (SST) is recommended for the SVC (
         Scalable Video Codec) video transport <xref target='RFC6190' /> 
         and MVC (Multiview Video Codec) video transport <xref target='I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-mvc'/>
. 
         In SST, a single RTP session conveys all the related media data, 
         namely all the bitstream components. A bitstream component here is part of a media stram 
         that has a common property which could be:
         <list style="symbols">
          <t>
          Layer: in SVC media stream; In this case, a bitstream component is media data
           of a specific layer.
          </t>
          <t>
          View: in MVC media stream; In this case, a bitstream component is media data 
          of a specific view.
          </t>
          </list>
       </t>
       <t>
       In such a SST session,one or several bitstream components together may be decodable by themselves
       and therefore make sense to the receiver. These bitstream component(s) combinations are here called Substream.
        </t>
       <t>    
       In SVC and MVC RTP sessions, such a Substream is identified by an Operation Point. 
       </t>
       <t>
		 There are cases that a client wants to retrieve a specific substream
		  in such a SST session.  However, in the current RTSP 2.0 protocol,
		   the control of the media is on media stream basis, e.g. as an RTP session
		   when RTP is used.  This prevents a client to
		   receive only certain substream(s) from the media.

       </t>
       <t>
       This memo extends the RTSP 2.0<xref target='I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis'/> 
       to establish a substream playback control framework, 
       which enables a client to play a part of a media stream. 
       </t>
       <t>
       This memo also defines the substream usage for SVC and MVC.

     <section title="Protocol Overview">
       <t>
       The whole framework includes substream annotation, capability negotiation 
       and substream playback control.
       This section provides an overview of substream control.
       </t>
       
      <section anchor="substream-annotation" title="Substream Annotation">
       <t>
       Substream annotation is used to announce  identifiers for all substreams available in a media stream.
       which can be retrieved selectively. It is done through a presentation description, typically using an SDP description. 
       Substream annotation based on SDP is described in this section. 
       Substream annotation based on other formats is out of scope of this document.
       </t><t>
       In SVC, a substream is described as an operation point,
        which consists of the bitstream components required to 
        be able to decode a particular dependency_id, quality_id, 
        and temporal_id combination. SVC operation points are 
        described through the sprop-operation-point-info attribute in SDP 
        as defined in <xref target='RFC6190'/>. 

      </t><t>
		According to <xref target='RFC6190'/>, the value of sprop-operation-point-info consists of a comma-separated list of operation-point-description vectors. Each operation-point-description vector represents a substream. Each operation-point-description vector has ten elements,where the first element layer-ID is the identifier of the operation point. This layer-ID can be taken as the identifier for the SVC substream. Since the layer-ID is optional, it may not be included. In this case, a [dependency-ID,
   temporal_ID, quality-ID] combination is taken as the identifier instead.
		</t>
       <t>
       Annocation of MVC substreams is specified in <xref target='I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-mvc'/>.
       </t>
       <t>
       editor notes: pending on the complement of <xref target='I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-mvc'/>.
       </t>
     </section>
         <section title="Capability Negotiation">
       <t>
       Capability negotiation can be used to negotiate  support of substream control between RTSP client and server.
       It makes use of the RTSP feature tag mechanism defined in RTSP 2.0<xref target='I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis'/>.
       A new feature tag (play.substream) is defined in <xref target='feature-tag'/>.
       </t>
       <t>
       Whenever it has received a media presentation with substream annotation, 
       a substream control capable RTSP client SHALL include play.substream 
       in the SUPPORTED header of the RTSP SETUP request.
		 This indicates that the client is able to control the playback of the media on substream basis.
       </t>
       <t>
       A 2xx response implies that the server is capable of substream control. 
       A server MAY refuse the request with a 551 "Option not supported" response, 
       with an UNSUPPORT header including play.substream.
      </t>
       <t>
        The receiving client may try to setup a session without this feature later. 
        This means that the client will not perform substream control and play the media as a whole. 
        In the SVC case, the client will play all the layers in the session, 
        whereas in the MVC case it will play all the views in the session.
     </t>       
     </section>
     <section title="Substream Playback Control">
       <t>
		In case the session is setup correctly, the client may control the play back on substream basis, including:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
          start to play a substream
          </t>

          <t>
          pause a substream. Note that this means it will pause the play back of the whole session.
          </t>
          </list>
       </t> 
       <section title="Play a Substream">
       <t>
       After successful set up of an RTSP session, the client may perform substream playback control.
       The playback of a substream is similar with the normal playback of a session, 
       except that the PLAY request shall contain a "SubstreamCtrl" header with substream type 
       and the substream id corresponding to the substream that the client intends to play. 
       Here the substream id idetifies a specific operation point. 
         The actual definition of the substream id is defined by each substream type.
  
       </t>
       <t>
       When more than one media stream are controlled, 
       the header shall further contain Request-URIs for each of the the substreams.
       </t>
       <t>
       Following is the specification of substream types for SVC and MVC media stream. 
	  Specification for other substream type is out of scope of current document 
      and should be registered in IANA, as described in  <xref target='Substream_Type_Registration'/>. 
        </t>
       <t>
       When the media stream is an SVC stream as defined in <xref target='RFC6190'/>, 
       the substream type shall be "SVC"; 
 
       The substream id could be either a layer-id
       or a [dependency-ID, temporal_ID, quality-ID] combination, 
       which comes from an operation-point-description vector.
       
       </t>
       <t>
       When the media stream is an MVC stream as defined in <xref target='I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-mvc'/>, 
       the substream type shall be "MVC". 
       </t><t>
       For MVC, substream id is...
       </t>
       <t>
        editor's note: substream id for MVC is pending on the complement of draft-ietf-payload-rtp-mvc-00.
      </t>
       <t>
        A client should not perform substream play if the server has not 
        indicated support of substream control in an ealier message exchange.
       </t>
       <t>
       Upon receiving a PLAY request with a "SubstreamCtrl" header, the server SHALL identify the substream(s) according to the id(s) and Request-URI(s) in the request, and then provides the indicated substream(s) after sending a 200 OK response.  
       </t>
       <t>
       If the server doesn't support substream control, it should respond a 551 "Option not supported" response as defined in RTSP 2.0<xref target='I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis'/>.
       </t>
       <t>
       If the server supports substream control but the substream type indicated in the "SubstreamCtrl" header is not recognized, it shall response wth a 552 "Substream Type Not Recognizable" response, see  <xref target='status-code-552'/>.
        </t>
       <t>      
       If the server supports substream control but the substream type indicated in the "SubstreamCtrl" header is not recognized, it shall response wth 552 "Substream Type Not Recognizable", see  <xref target='status-code-552'/>.
        </t>
       <t>    
       If a requested media is not allowed to be played on substream basis as requested, the server SHALL respond with a 553 "Substream Control Not Allowed" response, see  <xref target='status-code-553'/>.
       </t>
       <t>
       If the requested substream id is not valid, the server shall response with 554 "Substream id not valid", see <xref target='status-code-554'/>.
       </t>
       </section>

        <section title="Pause a Substream">
       <t>
   The pause operation of a substream is identical to the pause operation of
   a normal session.  It is not necessary for the client to include a
   "SubstreamCtrl" header in the pause request message.  However, if the
   request includes a "SubstreamCtrl" header, it shall list all the
   substreams are currently played.

	</t>
       <t>
        If aggregated control is used, it is not allowed to pause only a part of a session.
 It is also not allowed to pause only a specific substream from
   a media stream.

       </t>
       </section>
       </section>

    <section title="RTSP Extensions">
       <t>
       This section documentsthe extension to the RTSP 2.0 specification. Specifically  <xref target='substream-header'/> specifies the SubstreamCtrl header,  <xref target='feature-tag'/> specifies the substream control feature tag,  <xref target='status-code'/> specifies the status codes extentions for the substream control feature.
