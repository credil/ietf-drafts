1. Introduction 

  In the context of CDNI, the downstream CDN needs to advertise some 
  of its information to the upstream CDN to facilitate the upstream 
  CDN selecting an appropriate CDN as the target in request routing, 
  such as downstream CDN capabilities, resources and affinities (i.e.  
  Preferences or cost).   
    
  This document focuses on defining the information needed to be 
  exchanged in CDNI and the corresponding advertising protocol, which 
  is one of the main components of CDNI. 
      

1.1. Terminology 

  This document reuses the terminology defined in [I-D.draft-cdni-
  problem-statement].

  explicitly shown. Although that might be changed later upon the 
  working group's decision, but now it is thought that capability 
  advertisement is part of the function of the Request Routing 
  interface.

2. Conventions used in this document 

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. CDN selection criteria  

  An upstream CDN may perform downstream CDN selection according to 
  different kinds of filtering criteria deriving from CP's requirement 
  and/or its local policy. 

  One kind of criteria is derived from CP's requirement. Each CP is 
  most likely to expect to control the distribution and delivery of 
  its contents by its delegated CDN. To achieve that, CP reflects its 
  requirements via metadata pertaining to the content and transfer the 
  metadata to the CDN to enforce that. In the context of CDNI, this 
  metadata should also be further transferred to a downstream CDN for 
  the same purpose. Subsequently, while the upstream CDN receving a 
  content request and intends to select an appropriate downstream CDN 
  from multiple ones to redirect the request, it should filter the 
  downstream CDNs according the metadata, e.g. in the metadata, it is 
  required the content should be delivered via HTTP adaptive streaming 
  service, a downstream CDN without the capability should not be 
  selected. Therefore, the required capability contained in the 
  metadata as a source of filtering criteria is needed for CDN 
  selection and is to be advertised from a downstream CDN to an 
  upstream CDN. 

  Another kind of criteria is derived from upstream CDN's local policy. 
  There are various kind of local poicy deployed, e.g. minimal load 
  first, minimal expense first, optimal QoS preferred etc. To 
  implement these policies, relative capability/status information of 
  a downstream CDN should be advertised to its upstream CDN.  

  In addition, general information like service status, IP version of 
  downstream CDN should also be taken into account while making the 
  CDN selection.  

  Based on the above mentioned filtering criteria, we can list the

Internet-Draft          cap-info-advertising                March 2012 
   

  corresponding capability and status information needed as followings: 

    * General information like the service status, IP version of the 
    downstream CDN is needed. 

    * Footprint of the downstream CDN is needed if proximity is 
    preferred while making routing decision. 

    * Load status of resources is needed if minimal load is preferred 
    while making routing decision.    

    * Cost information of downstream CDN is needed if minimal cost is 
    preferred while making routing decision. 

    * Delivery capability information like delivery service type, user 
    authentication method of downstream CDN is needed if CP's 
    requirements contained in CDNI metadata is the main preference of 
    routing decision.  

    Note: The information needed to be advertised according to the CDNI 
    metadata should be adjusted once protocol on that interface is 
    finalized.  

4. Description of information 

  According to the CDN selection criteria listed in section 3, the 
  relative capability and status information advertised from a 
  dwonstream CDN to an interconnected upstream CDN is described in 
  detail in the following clause. The information is considered all as 
  mandatory unless otherwise state explicitly. 

4.1. General information 

4.1.1. Service status 

 Service status is used to indicate that the downstream CDN is in 
 service or out of service of CDNI. In service means that the 
 downstream CDN's status is normal and it is willing to take requests 
 from an upstream CDN. Out of service means that the downstream CDN can 
 not take any requests from an upstream CDN due to some abnormal cases, 

 e.g.:  

   O Some kind of resource on the downstream CDN is exhausted. 

   O Network link between the two connected CDNs is abnormal. 

 
 
He et all             Expires September 6, 2012               [Page 6] 
   
Internet-Draft          cap-info-advertising                March 2012 
   

   O Downstream CDN is down. 

4.1.2. IP version 

 IP address version of which a downstream CDN can serve for endpoints. 
 The value it takes could be "IPV4", "IPV6" and "IPV4&IPV6" the last 
 one means that the downstream CDN can serve for both the types of 
 endpoints. 

4.2. Footprint 

  Footprint indicates the geographic region for which a CDN can serve. 
  It is identified by a set of country, state and city code 
  combination as defined in ISO 3166-2 or a set of autonomous system 
  number or a set of IP subnet.  

  A downstream CDN may advertise its footprint in a macro level e.g. 
  the country names of the serving regions belong to, it may also 
  advertise its footprint in a granularity of subset of the macro 
  level, e.g. detail state or city name of the serving regions. In the 
  later case, if there are multiple regions belong to one country a 
  downstream CDN can serve, then there will be multiple state or city 
  footprint elements in one advertisement message. This finer 
  granularity allows an upstream CDN understand the downstream CDN 
  more precisely but puts more requirements on the downstream CDN. 
  Therefore, it is up to the downstream CDN to determine to which 
  granularity it should advertise to an upstream CDN. 

  Upon each footprint, the other information like load status of 
  resources, capability information described in the following part of 
  this section are encapsulated to express the current status and 
  capabilities associated to this specific region. 

4.3. Load status 

  Load status represents the status of resources assigned to an 
  upstream CDN by a downstream CDN and their current usage. This 
  information is important for the upstream CDN to implement the 
  minimal load first local policy. It contains a mandatory binary 
  serving indication to tell the upstream CDN whether the downstream 
  CDN can or cannot serve end users on behalf of the upstream CDN from 
  the perspective of resource load. It can optional contains the 
  detailed contracted and current used value of a specific resource in 
  case  that  the  downstream  CDN  is  willing  to  advertise  such 
  information to the upstream CDN. For example they belong to one 
  group and have a strong trust relationship between them.

Internet-Draft          cap-info-advertising                March 2012 
   

4.3.1. Basic serving indicator 

  Basic serving indicator is used to tell whether a downstream CDN has 
  the ability to accept more additional requests from the upstream CDN 
  or not from the perspective of its resource load status.  

4.3.2. Detailed resource status 

  Detailed resource status is used to advertise the maximum value of 
  capacity the downstream CDN committed to the upstream CDN and the 
  current assignments of it. This information can be leveraged by the 
  upstream CDN to implement a more accurate CDN selection if there 
  exists multiple candidate downstream CDNs through the previous basic 
  serving indication. It is reflected through the following three 
  category resource in detail:  

    * Connection Allowed, Connection Assigned 

    This information is used to indicate the maximum number of 
    simultaneous TCP connections for HTTP of the downstream CDN 
    committed to provide to the upstream CDN for content delivery and 
    the current used number respectively.  

    * Bandwidth Allowed, Bandwidth Consumed  

    This information is used to indicate the maximum value of bandwidth 
    for content delivery of the downstream CDN committed to provide to 
    the upstream CDN and current used value respectively.  

   Note: The value of "andwidth Allowed" and "Bandwidth Consumed" may 
  be an absolute value taking only the physical bandwidth of the CDN 
  into account or it may be a normalized value which may also consider 
  the disk I/O capacity and CPU usage as a whole. This depends on the 
  CDN specific implementation and is out of scope of CDNI. 
    
    * Cached Assets Allowed, Cached Assets 

    This information is used to indicate the maximum value of storage 
    capacity of cache of the downstream CDN committed to provide to the 
    upstream CDN and current used value respectively.  

4.4. Cost preferences 

  Cost preferences of the downstream CDN. Different downstream CDNs

Internet-Draft          cap-info-advertising                March 2012 
   

  may characterize cost via various metrics e.g. hop-count, air-miles, 
  or monetary cost. An upstream CDN can negotiate with a downstream 
  CDN on how to characterize cost of CDNI via the attributes "cost 
  type" and "cost mode". 

  Note: The detailed mechanism that the two interconnected CDNs 
  negotiating on the abstract cost assignment is out of scope of this 
  draft.  

   o  type: identifies what the costs represent, e.g. hop-count, 
   monetary cost etc; 

   o mode:  identifies  how  the  costs  should  be  interpreted. 
   Specifically, the mode attribute indicates whether returned costs 
   should be interpreted as numerical values or ordinal rankings. It is 
   important to communicate such information to the upstream CDN, as 
   certain operations may not be valid on certain costs returned by a 
   downstream CDN. 

    o  cost: value of the cost corresponding to the selected type and 
     mode. 

4.5. Authentication capability 

  Authentication capability describes the authentication type and 
  relative parameters a downstream CDN supports to the clients.  It 
  provides information for content delivery such that the user agent 
  can be authenticated as a client when requesting content from a 
  downstream CDN. The authentication capability contains the 
  following attributes: 
   
     O type - a string indicating the authorization type "url-signing" 
       or "url-token". The "url-signing" type refers to URL signing 
      authorization. The "url-token" type refers to token-based 
      authorization. 
   
     O algorithm- a string containing the signature algorithm (e.g. 
  "md5", "sha-1", etc.).

Internet-Draft          cap-info-advertising                March 2012 
   

   
     O key type - a boolean if true, URL signing uses symmetric keys, 
       otherwise asymmetric. 
 
4.6. Delivery service capability 

    Type of the delivery service a downstream CDN supports, e.g. 
    Microsoft Smooth Streaming, Apple HTTP Live Streaming.  It contains 
    the following attributes: 

    O service type- a string containing the type of the delivery 
    service e.g. "HLS"and "DASH".  

5. Overview of the capability advertising protocol 

5.1. Transport mechansim of the protocol 

  CDN capability is information coupling with a specified application 
  (CDNI), it should be conveyed via an application layer protocol 
  rather than any other underlying layer protocol e.g. IP layer 
  protocol which should de-coupling with any application. In this 
  document HTTP/1.1 protocol [RFC2616] is used as the transport 
  mechanism for capability information advertising as its a natural 
  choice for integration with existing applications and infrastructure.  
   
5.2. Operation mode of the protocol 

  The capability information advertising protocol takes two modes. One 
  is report mode, where the downstream CDN advertises its capability 
  information to the upstream CDN during at a periodic interval, e.g. 
  every 5 minutes. The other one is query mode, where the upstream CDN 
  acquires  the  capability  information  from  the  downstream  CDN 
  periodically, e.g. every 5 minutes. The upstream CDN utilizes the 
  capability information to makes its routing decision upon receiving 
  a content request from an end user.

Internet-Draft          cap-info-advertising                March 2012 
   

5.3. Discovery of the protocol contact point 

  To enable communication over the capability information advertising 
  protocol, the two interconnected CDNs need to know each other's 
  contact address. The contact address may be statically pre-
  configured, dynamically discovered via control interface, or other 
  means. However, they are not specified in this document, as this is 
  considered not in the scope of the CDNI capability information 
  advertising protocol.

    JSONString   [DeliveryType]<1..*>; 

  }FootPrint, 

6.1.5. Encoding of general information 

  { 

    JSONString   ServiceStatus; 

    JSONString   [IPVersion]<"IPV4","IPV6">; 

    FootPrint    [FootPrint]<0..*>; 

  } 

6.2. Message description 

  The HTTP/1.1 protocol is used for capability advertising. 
   
  The HTTP request is HTTP POST for Report mode and HTTP GET for Query 
  mode respectively. 
   
  The request URI in both modes conforms to [RFC3986]. The URI format 
  in this document is as follows: HTTP://<host>/<url-path>, where the 
  <host> specifies a destination, and the <url-path>  conveys the 
  message name. 
   
  The message body representation specified in this document takeing 
  JavaScript Object Notation(JSON) as example. However, other well-
  defined representations (e.g., XML) are also acceptable. 

6.2.1. Report mode 

  The Downstream CDN issues an HTTP POST message to the Upstream CDN 
  to report its capability information. 
   
  The message name in the request URI is "CdniCapReport".

Internet-Draft          cap-info-advertising                March 2012 
   

   
  The Content-Type header field is "application/json". 
   
  The message body includes capability information. 
   
  Upon successful receipt of the POST request, the Upstream CDN 
  responds with a 200 OK message. 
 
 
6.2.2. Query mode 

  The Upstream CDN issues a HTTP GET message to a Downstream CDN to 
  query its capability information. 
   
  The message name in the request URI is "CdniCapQuery". 
   
  Upon successful receipt of the GET request, the Downstream CDN 
  responds a 200 OK message with its capability information. 
   
  The Content-Type header field for the response is "application/json". 
   

6.3. Message examples 

  This section gives some message examples for capability information 
  advertising protocol. 

6.3.1. Report mode 

  The POST request and corresponding response are illustrated as below.

7. Security Considerations 

  Capability advertising is a main function which will affect the 
  final routing decision of an upstream CDN, security threats on it 
  include that any identity spoofing of the downstream CDN or changing 
  of the capability advertising message with malicious intent which 
  would cause the upstream CDN redirect an end user request to an 
  inappropriate downstream CDN which possible cannot provide service 
  to the end user.   
    
  It is mentioned in section 8 of the requirement draft [I-D.draft-
  cdni-requirements], all the CDNI interface shall support secure 
  operation over unsecured IP connectivity (e.g. The Internet).  This 
  includes authentication, confidentiality, integrity protection as 
  well as protection against spoofing and replay. As this security 
  requirement applies to all the CDNI interfaces and it is recommended 
  that the working group addresses this issue and considers a 
  consistent solution in another separate document later. 
 
8. IANA Considerations 

  If the approach described in this document is adopted, we would 
  request that IANA allocate the message name "CdniCapReport" and 
  CdniCapQuery" in the HTTP Parameters registry.
