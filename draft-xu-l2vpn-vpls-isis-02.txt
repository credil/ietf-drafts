Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS             October 2011 
 
    
1. Introduction 

   To support virtual machine (VM) mobility and cluster services at 
   scale in a cloud data center which accommodates multiple tenants 
   over a shared physical infrastructure, a scalable L2VPN solution is 
   essential for interconnecting those millions of servers/VMs while 
   isolating tens of thousands of tenants within that virtualized data 
   center environment. Such L2VPN solution SHOULD be able to support 
   the shortest path forwarding and the Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) 
   forwarding capabilities so as to maximize the bandwidth capacity 
   between servers. Besides, it SHOULD be able to provide enough VPN 
   instances in order to securely isolate a large number of tenants 
   from each other. VPLS seems as a good L2VPN solution for cloud data 
   centers since it can almost meet all of the above requirements. 
   However, the existing VPLS solutions including BGP VPLS [RFC4761] 
   and LDP VPLS [RFC4762] are a bit heavy-weight for cloud data center 
   operators due to the following reasons: first, the existing VPLS 
   solutions require one or more separate protocols dedicated for VPLS 
   auto-discovery and signaling to be deployed besides IGP which has 
   been already deployed in data centers; second, full-meshed pseudo-
   wires(PWs)associated with the existing VPLS solutions introduce much 
   burden and complexity for maintenance; third, head-end replication 
   for multicast and broadcast that is used by the existing VPLS 
   solutions is sub-optimal from the bandwidth utilization perspective. 

   Hence, this document describes a IS-IS [IS-IS][RFC1195] based light-
   weight VPLS solution which retains the scalability features while 
   overcoming the shortages of the existing VPLS solutions as mentioned 
   above. In IS-IS VPLS, the IS-IS routing protocol which has been 
   already deployed within the data center is extended to realize VPLS, 
   in addition, there is no full-meshed PWs anymore between PE routers. 
   To achieve better bandwidth utilization, PIM multicast trees could 
   be used for delivering multicast, broadcast, and even unknown 
   unicast traffic.  

   Note that, in IS-IS VPLS, the VPLS label contained in the L2VPN data 
   packets (e.g., MAC-in-MPLS-in-IP) is only used for identifying a 
   particular VPLS instance, rather than identifying both a particular 
   VPLS instance and a particular ingress PE router as the PW label 
   does. Therefore, IP-based tunnel is required to be used as the PE-
   to-PE tunnel technology in IS-IS VPLS so that the egress PE router 
   could determine the ingress PE routers of the received L2VPN data 
   packets from the source address of the tunnel header when performing 
   MAC address learning.

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4664], [VPLS-MCAST], 
   [RFC4761] and [RFC4762].  

3. Control Plane 

   There are two primary functions of the VPLS control plane: auto-
   discovery and signaling. In IS-IS VPLS, these two functions are 
   accomplished simultaneously by using a single IS-IS TLV 
   advertisement. One concern of using IS-IS to distribute the VPLS 
   membership information is that the VPLS membership information would 
   be exposed to P routers unnecessarily. However, in today's cloud 
   data center networks which are becoming more and more flat, the 
   number of P routers within a data center network would not be too 
   large, furthermore, the extended IS-IS TLV for VPLS is partially 
   transparent to P routers, that is to say, P routers don't need to 
   process the VPLS membership information contained in that IS-IS TLV, 
   but only need to synchronize the Link State PDUs (LSP) with their 
   adjacent IS-IS neighbors.

Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS             October 2011 
 
       Type   

           TLV Type code for VPLS: TBD. 

       Length  

           Total number of bytes contained in the value field. 

       PE's IPv4 or IPv6 Address  

           This 128-bit field is filled with one of the PE router's IP 
           addresses which are reachable across the backbone. The 
           address filled in this field SHOULD be used as tunnel 
           destination addresses by remote PE routers when sending a 
           customer packet to such PE router. If the IP address is IPv4, 
           the last four octets of this field are filled with the IPv4 
           address while the remaining part is set to zero. In other 
           words, it is filled with an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. 

       VPLS ID  

           This field is filled with a 20-bit globally unique VPLS ID 
           for a particular attached VPLS instance. In case that a 
           larger VPLS ID space is required, the leftmost 12-bit 
           reserved field could be used together with the VPLS ID field 
           as an extended VPLS ID filed. That is to say, the whole 32 
           bits are filled with a 32-bit long VPLS ID value. 

       VPLS Label 

           This field is filled with a 20-bit MPLS label corresponding 
           to the VPLS instance which is identified by the VPLS ID.  

   3.2. Auto-Discovery 

   In IS-IS VPLS, each PE router could automatically discover which 
   other PE routers are part of a given VPLS instance that is 
   identified by the globally unique VPLS ID. This allows each PE 
   router's configuration to consist only of the identity of the VPLS 
   instance established on this PE router, not the identity of every 
   other PE router in that VPLS instance. 

   3.3. Signaling 

   In IS-IS VPLS, it is REQUIRED that a PE router SHOULD assign the 
   same MPLS label for a given VPLS instance to any other PE router. In 
   other words, this VPLS label is used for identifying a particular

Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS             October 2011 
 
   VPLS instance, rather than identifying both a particular VPLS 
   instance and the corresponding ingress PE router as the PW label 
   does. 

   The VPLS label in IS-IS VPLS just needs to be locally unique, rather 
   than globally unique for most cases except the aggregate P-Multicast 
   tree based VPLS multicast case where a single P-Multicast tree is 
   shared by more than one VPLS instance and the ability to use 
   upstream-assigned labels [RFC5331] is not available. For example, in 
   unicast and ingress-replication multicast cases [VPLS-MCAST], it is 
   no necessary for the VPLS label to be globally unique. Besides, in 
   the non-aggregative P-Multicast tree [VPLS-MCAST] based VPLS 
   multicast case where a single P-Multicast tree is exclusively used 
   by no more than one VPLS instance, the MAC-in-IP encapsulation is 
   used since the multicast address itself in the IP based tunnel 
   header is enough for identifying a particular VPLS instance. 
   Therefore, it doesn't require the VPLS label to be globally unique 
   either. 

   In the aggregate P-Multicast tree [VPLS-MCAST] based VPLS multicast 
   mode, the globally unique labels could be used if the ability to use 
   upstream-assigned labels is not available. In this case, the VPLS 
   label for a given VPLS instance directly equals the VPLS ID of that 
   VPLS instance.  

4. Data Plane 

   4.1. Data Encapsulation and Forwarding 

    4.1.1. Unicast 

   MAC-in-MPLS-in-IP encapsulation [RFC4448][RFC4023] SHOULD be used 
   for unicast. The IP here means any of IP based encapsulations, such 
   as MPLS-in-IP and MPLS-in-GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation). There 
   is almost no difference from BGP VPLS and LDP VPLS from the aspect 
   of data forwarding.  

   For unknown unicast, the encapsulation and forwarding is the same as 
   that for multicast/broadcast described in the following section. 

    4.1.2. Multicast/Broadcast  

   There are two major multicast modes for IS-IS VPLS: ingress 
   replication mode and P-Multicast tree mode. 

   The encapsulation corresponding to each mode is described in the 
   following sub-sections.

Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS             October 2011 
 
    4.1.2.1. Ingress Replication Mode 

   In the ingress replication mode, an ingress PE router forward the CE 
   multicast/broadcast frames received via its attachment circuits 
   towards each remote PE router of the same VPLS instance in the 
   separate IP based tunnels destined for each remote PE router. Hence, 
   the encapsulation in this mode has no difference from that for 
   unicast. 

    4.1.2.2. Non-aggregative P-Multicast Tree Mode 

   In the non-aggregative P-Multicast tree mode where a single P-
   Multicast distribution tree in the backbone is exclusively used by 
   one VPLS instance, the MAC-in-IP encapsulation is used directly 
   since the destination IP address (i.e., multicast address) contained 
   in the IP-based tunnel header is enough for the egress PE routers to 
   determine which VPLS instance the encapsulated customer packets 
   received from a remote PE router belongs to. 

    4.1.2.3. Aggregative P-Multicast Tree Mode 

   For aggregative P-Multicast tree mode in which a single P-Multicast 
   tree is shared by more than one VPLS instance, MAC-in-MPLS-IP 
   encapsulation SHOULD be used. The upstream-assigned MPLS label 
   contained in the inner MPLS header would be used by the egress PE 
   routers to identify the particular VPLS instance that the received 
   customer packets belong to. The locally unique VPLS labels which are 
   advertised in the IS-IS TLVs for VPLS could actually be used as 
   upstream labels in this mode as well besides being used for known 
   unicast forwarding. For example, assume PE-1 advertises a locally 
   unique label L for VPLS instance X with that IS-IS TLV, PE-1 could 
   send a multicast packet for VPLS X containing label L as an 
   upstream-assigned label. The egress PE routers could distinguish 
   whether the MPLS label contained in the encapsulated VPLS packet is 
   an upstream-assigned label or a downstream-assigned label according 
   to the "MPLS label type" information contained in the encapsulated 
   VPLS packets, taken the MPLS-in-GRE encapsulation as an example, the 
   protocol type field in the GRE header would be set to 0x8847 for 
   MPLS unicast and 0x8848 for multicast. 

   Alternatively, to avoid using the complex upstream MPLS label 
   assignment mechanism [RFC5331], operators could also use the 
   globally unique VPLS labels provided this usage is doable in such 
   particular network environment (i.e., a relatively close data center 
   network environment). Thus, the VPN ID value for a given VPLS 
   instance would be equal to its corresponding VPLS Label value.

   More details about the aggregative P-Multicast tree mode are for 
   further study. 

   4.2. MAC Address Learning 

   MAC addresses of local CE hosts can be learnt by a PE router as a 
   normal bridge does. 

   As for learning MAC addresses of remote CE hosts, data-driven MAC 
   learning is still available in IS-IS VPLS. For example, upon 
   receiving an encapsulated customer packet from a remote PE router, 
   the MPLS label contained in the MPLS header of the data packet (or 
   the destination multicast IP address contained in the IP-based 
   tunnel header in the case of using non-aggregative P-Multicast trees 
   for delivering unknown unicast packets)is used to determine the 
   particular VPLS instance that the data packet belongs to, while the 
   source IP address contained in the IP-based tunnel header is used to 
   tell from which ingress PE router the data packet is sent.  

   Besides, MAC addresses of remote CE hosts can also be learnt on the 
   control plane by using IS-IS for MAC address reachability 
   announcement. The following sub-section describes the basic idea of 
   such alternative. 

    4.2.1. MAC Address Reachability Announcement 

   To alleviate the impact on the control plane of P routers, CE MAC 
   address reachability information SHOULD be fully transparent to P 
   routers as if the packets containing that information were 
   encapsulated customer packets. Furthermore, the CE MAC address 
   reachability information of a given VPLS instance SHOULD only be 
   distributed to those PE routers of that VPLS instance.  

   Upon learning the MAC addresses of their local CE hosts, PE routers 
   would immediately advertise these MAC addresses to other PE routers 
   of the same VPN instance by using the MAC-Reachability TLV defined 
   in [RFC6165]. One or more MAC-Reachability TLVs are carried in a LSP 
   which in turn is encapsulated with an Ethernet header. The source 
   MAC address is the originating PE router's MAC address whereas the 
   destination MAC address is a to-be-defined multicast MAC address 
   specifically identifying IS-IS VPLS PE routers. Such LSPs are 
   forwarded towards remote PE routers as customer packets by ingress 
   PE routers. Egress PE routers receiving the above packets SHOULD 
   intercept them and accordingly process them. It is obvious that 
   these ISPs are fully transparent to P routers because they are 
   forwarded by P routers as if they were encapsulated customer packets. 
   The next-hop information associated with these MAC routes could be

   derived from the "IP Interface Address" field contained in the 
   corresponding LSPs. 

   More details about how to learn remote CE MAC addresses on the 
   control plane are for further study. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This document doesn't introduce additional security risk to IS-IS 
   and VPLS, nor does it provide any additional security feature for 
   IS-IS and VPLS. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   The IS-IS TLV code for VPLS is required to be defined by IANA.
