    <abstract>
      <t>
      This document describes a mechanism for extending ICE candidates with an optional parameter which can be used to negotiate the usage of bundled media, which refers to the usage of a single 5-tuple for multiple RTP streams.  In a scenario where a party initiating the negotiation supports ICE <xref target="RFC5245"></xref> this mechanism provides the ability to provide an SDP offer which is both backwards compatible and able to fully specify the use of bundled media. Therefore, this mechanism allows bundled and non-bundled media to be negotiated in a single offer/answer exchange when both parties support ICE and this extension.

      The mechanism complements the procedures  described in <xref target="draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation"></xref>.

    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
      This document describes a mechanism for extending ICE candidates with an optional parameter which can be used to negotiate the usage of bundled media, which refers to the usage of a single 5-tuple for multiple RTP streams.  In a scenario where a party initiating the negotiation supports ICE <xref target="RFC5245"></xref> this mechanism provides the ability to provide an SDP offer which is both backwards compatible and able to fully specify the use of bundled media. Therefore, this mechanism allows bundled and non-bundled media to be negotiated in a single offer/answer exchange when both parties support ICE and this extension.
      </t><t>
      The mechanism complements the procedures within <xref target="draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation"></xref> with explicitly signalled ports (OPEN ISSUE: Possibly also IP Address for the bundle media in each candidate that may form part of a bundle). If the MMUSIC working group agrees this could be considered as an enhancement for incorporation in to <xref target="draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation"></xref>.
     </t><t>
        A problem with the existing bundling proposals is that it does not appear possible to create a single initial offer that will allow bundle to be negotiated but maintain interworking with bundle unaware implementations and therefore it is necessary to perform an initial offer/answer exchange which does not fully describe or at least only implicitly describes what the offerer really wants to offer.  The existing bundle proposals also don't take account of the fact that when both parties support ICE <xref target="RFC5245"></xref> the port in the m-line of the initial offer may not be used at all, for example due to a dual stack offer endpoint offering IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in parallel.
     </t><t>
     Also the existing bundle proposals have not considered some of the more complex ICE scenarios involving multiple candidates. For example when an SDP m-line contains multiple ICE host candidates during dual stack negotiation, the candidates cannot be considered equivalent with regard to bundling with candidates on in another m-line and therefore some way of indicating which candidates can be bundled seems to be desirable. This could be achieved by including the complete bundle transport address (IP and Port) in the candidate or by providing some kind of bundle linkage within the ICE candidate lines.
     </t><t>
          OPEN ISSUE: Some analysis is required to determine whether it is also necessary to specify the bundle IP Address in the ICE candidate in addition to the bundleport. Explicitly stating the complete transport address for the bundle seems advantageous.  This might also be necessary if for example different relay IP addresses are specified for audio and video in the non-bundled case but a single bundled IP address is required.

         <t>5-tuple: A collection of the following values: source address, source port, destination address, destination port and protocol.</t>
        <t>Bundled media: Two or more RTP streams using a single 5-tuple. The RTCP streams associated with the RTP streams also use a single 5-tuple, which might be the same, but can also be different, as the one used by the RTP streams.</t>
        </section>

    <section anchor="SDPOffer" title="SDP Offerer Procedures">
     <t>
        This document defines an ICE candidate extension to the ICE candidate with an attribute named "bundleport" which specifies the port to be used to bundle media.
        </t>
        <t>
        When generating an SDP offer which is to include a bundle group and also ICE candidates the offerer follows the procedures as specified in <xref target="draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation"></xref> and in addition also includes in each ICE candidate which relates to a bundle the new bundleport extension which specifies the port to be used for the multiplex.
        </t>
        <t>
        By following the additional procedures specified in this document the following advantages are realised:
        <list style="symbols">
        <t>In the case when the answerer supports ICE the initial offer can be both bundle and non-bundle compatible.</t>
        <t>Only one offer/answer cycle is needed to negotiate bundle or non-bundle cases.  A second offer/answer may be needed following the initial negotiation which is normal ICE procedures</t>
        <t>It works for the dual stack scenario in which the port eventually used may only initially be signalled in the candidate line..</t>
        </list>
        </t>
        <t>An example SDP Offer is shown below. Note that the a=candidate: attributes are split over two lines.</t>

    <section anchor="SDPAnswer" title="SDP Answerer Procedures">
     <t>
        When an SDP Answerer receives an SDP Offer which contains a "BUNDLE" group, and the SDP Answerer accepts the offered "BUNDLE" group, the SDP Answerer MUST generate an SDP Answer as specified in <xref target="draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation"></xref> with the exception that rather than using the port associated with the first "m=" line in the "BUNDLE" group it MUST use the bundleport from the selected ICE candidates relating to the bundle.
        </t>
         <t>Actually the requirement to use the port associated with the first "m=" line in the "BUNDLE" group whilst waiting for a second offer with identical ports in the m lines does not work in some ICE scenarios. For example when receiving an offer from a dual stack device the port on the "m=" line may refer to the transport for the wrong address family and may not even work if there is no connectivity</t>
