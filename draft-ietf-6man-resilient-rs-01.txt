            Packet loss resiliency for Router Solicitations
                    draft-ietf-6man-resilient-rs-01

Abstract

   When an interface on a host is initialized, the host transmits Router
   Solicitations in order to minimize the amount of time it needs to
   wait until the next unsolicited multicast Router Advertisement is
   received.  In certain scenarios, these router solicitations
   transmitted by the host might be lost.  This document specifies a
   mechanism for hosts to cope with the loss of the initial Router
   Solicitations.  Furthermore, on some links, unsolicited multicast
   Router Advertisements are never sent and the mechanism in this
   document is intended to work even in such scenarios.

1.  Introduction

   As specified in [RFC4861], when an interface on a host is
   initialized, in order to obtain Router Advertisements quickly, a host
   transmits up to MAX_RTR_SOLICITATIONS (3) Router Solicitation
   messages, each separated by at least RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL (4)
   seconds.  In certain scenarios, these router solicitations
   transmitted by the host might be lost.

   The generic scenario is that the interface on the host comes up
   before it gets access to a router.  Examples include:

   a.  The host is connected to a bridged residential gateway over
       Ethernet or WiFi.  LAN connectivity is achieved at interface
       initialization, but the upstream WAN connectivity is not active
       yet.  In this case, the host just gives up after the initial RS
       retransmits.
   b.  Access networks/links that turn off periodic RAs and only send
       RAs in response to RSs.  In this case, if the link between the AP
       and the host comes up before the link between the AP and the
       Controller/Router, the host will never be able to connect.
   c.  Links that are not multicast capable.  In this case, sending an
       RA can only be triggered by an RS (as is the case, for instance,
       on ISATAP [RFC5214] links).

   Once the initial RSs are lost, the host gives up and assumes that
   there are no routers on the link as specified in Section 6.3.7 of
   [RFC4861].  The host will not have any form of Internet connectivity
   until the next unsolicited multicast Router Advertisement is
   received.  These Router Advertisements are transmitted at most
   MaxRtrAdvInterval seconds apart (maximum value 1800 seconds).  Thus
   in the worst case scenario a host would be without any connectivity
   for 30 minutes.  In general, the delay may be unacceptable in some
   scenarios.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Proposed algorithm

   To achieve resiliency to packet loss, the host needs to continue
   retransmitting the Router Solicitations until it receives a Router
   Advertisement, or until it is willing to accept that no router
   exists.  If the host continues retransmitting the RSs at
   RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL second intervals, it may cause excessive
   network traffic if a large number of such hosts exists.  To achieve
   resiliency while keeping the aggregate network traffic low, the host
   can use some form of exponential backoff algorithm to retransmit the
   RSs.

   Hosts complying to this specification MUST use the exponential
   backoff algorithm for retransmits that is described in Section 14 of
   [RFC3315] in order to continuously retransmit the Router
   Solicitations until a Router Advertisement is received.  The hosts
   SHOULD use the following variables as input to the retransmission
   algorithm:

     IRT  4 seconds
     MRT  3600 seconds
     MRC  0
     MRD  0

   The initial value IRT was chosen to be in line with the current
   retransmission interval (RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL) that is specified
   by [RFC4861] and the maximum retransmission time MRT was chosen to be
   in line with the new value of SOL_MAX_RT as specified by [SOLMAXRT].
   This is to ensure that the short term behavior of the RSs is similar
   to what is experienced in current networks, and longer term
   persistent retransmission behavior trends towards being similar to
   that of DHCPv6 [RFC3315] [SOLMAXRT].

2.1.  Stopping the retransmissions

   On multicast-capable links, the hosts following this specification
   MUST stop retransmitting the RSs when an RA that results in a default
   route is received.  If an RA is recieved from a router and it does
   not result in a default route the host MUST continue retransmitting
   the RSs.

   On non-multicast links, the hosts following this specification MUST
   continue retransmitting the RSs even after an RA that results in a
   default route is received.  This is required because, in such links,
   sending an RA can only be triggered by an RS.

3.  Configuring the use of retransmissions

   Implementations of this specification MAY provide a configuration
   option to enable or disable the use of such potentially infinite
   retransmissions.  If the implementation provides such a configuration
   option, it MUST be able to enable/disable retransmissions on a per-
   interface basis.


4.  Known Limitations

   When an IPv6-capable host attaches to a network that does not have
   IPv6 enabled, it transmits 3 (MAX_RTR_SOLICITATIONS) Router
   Solicitations as specified in [RFC4861].  If it receives no Router
   Advertisements, it assumes that there are no routers present on the
   link and it ceases to send further RSs.  With the mechanism specified
   in this document, the host will continue to retransmit RSs
   indefinitely at the rate of approximately 1 RS per hour.  It is
   unclear how to differentiate between such a network with no IPv6
   routers and a link where an IPv6 router is temporarily unreachable
   but could become reachable in the future.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not present any additional security issues beyond
   those discussed in [RFC4861].
