1. Introduction

   The impact of congestion control on media streams is important in
   real-world deployments. Therefore, the purpose of this evaluation is
   to verify or inspect the video quality of RMCAT congestion control
   solutions under different test scenarios. RMCAT based rate
   adaptations should result in expected or desired video quality when
   implemented in a state-of-the-art video coding and communication
   framework. In other words, the purpose is to verify that there are no
   unexpected or undesired video quality problems caused by congestion

   control behaviors, while the main purpose is not to directly compare
   RMCAT solutions against each other. It is proposed to perform such
   video quality evaluation of candidate RMCAT solutions in addition to
   network traffic evaluations.

   An additional test scenario is proposed to evaluate the rate
   allocation behavior of RMCAT solutions when asymmetric flow
   conditions exist. In this test the video quality is not evaluated.

2. Video Quality Test Scenarios

   It is proposed to evaluate the visual quality of a subset of test
   scenarios described in [1]. The specifics are open for further
   discussion in the working group. Specific configuration parameters,
   such as bottleneck link rates, should be chosen so that video quality
   changes are visible.

   The video quality of the following congestion control behaviors is
   interesting to evaluate:

   o  Startup

   o  Varying bottleneck link bandwidth

   o  Staggered flow starts

   o  Background traffic (bursty)

   The following are video quality test scenarios based on [1].

2.1. Test Scenario A

   This scenario consists of a single bottleneck link and a single media
   flow. The purpose is to evaluate video quality under congestion
   control startup and varying bottleneck bandwidth behaviors.

2.1.1. Configuration

   Topology:

   o  Single bottleneck link

   o  Single RMCAT sender and receiver

   Bottleneck link rate varies between 1Mbps and 500kbps as follows:

   o  0-20s: 1Mbps

   o  20-80s: 500kbps

   o  80-100s: 1Mbps

   One-way propagation delay: 10ms

   Bottleneck queue type: drop-tail

   Bottleneck queue size: 32 packets

   Random loss rate over link: 0%

   Initial rate: 200kbps

2.1.2. Desired Video Quality Behavior

   Startup:

      Video quality improves and stabilizes within 4 seconds

   Bottleneck bandwidth drops from 1Mbps to 500kbps:

      Video quality decreases and stabilizes within 2 seconds

   Bottleneck bandwidth increases from 500kbps to 1Mbps:

      Video quality improves and stabilizes within 4 seconds

2.2. Test Scenario B

   Scenario B consists of a single bottleneck link and two media flows
   with different start times. The purpose is to evaluate video quality
   under the congestion control behavior when a second competing flow
   joins and leaves the bottleneck link.

2.2.1. Configuration

   Topology:

   o  Single bottleneck link

   o  Two RMCAT senders and receivers

   Second flow joins 20s after first flow and leaves after 40s.

   Bottleneck link rate is 1Mbps

   One-way propagation delay: 10ms

   Bottleneck queue type: drop-tail

   Bottleneck queue size: 32 packets

   Random loss rate over link: 0%

2.2.2. Desired Video Quality Behavior

   First media flow:

      After second flow joins, video quality of first flow decreases and
   stabilizes within 4 seconds. After second flow leaves, video quality
   increases and stabilizes within 4 seconds.

   Second media flow:

      At startup, the video quality improves and stabilizes within 4
   seconds.

   First and second flow:

      Video quality of both streams is similar.

2.3. Test Scenario C

   This scenario consists of a single bottleneck link with background
   traffic. The purpose is to evaluate video quality under congestion
   control behavior in the presence of bursty TCP flows.

2.3.1. Configuration

   Topology:

   o  Single bottleneck link

   o  Single RMCAT sender and receiver

   o  Single TCP sender to receiver

   Bursty TCP flow starts at 0s and stops at 60s.

   Media flow joins link after 20s.

   Bottleneck link speed is 1Mbps

Internet-Draft      RMCAT Video Quality Evaluation         October 2013


   One-way propagation delay: 10ms

   Bottleneck queue type: drop-tail

   Bottleneck queue size: 32 packets

   Random loss rate over link: 0%

   Bursty TCP flow parameters: to be defined

2.3.2. Desired Video Quality Behavior

   After media flow joins link (>20s):

      Video quality improves and stabilizes within 4 seconds.

   After TCP flow ends (>60s):

      Video quality improves and stabilizes within 4 seconds.

2.4. Video Coding and Communication Framework Discussion

   It is proposed that RMCAT solutions are implemented in a state-of-
   the-art video coding and communication framework to provide proof-of-
   concept evidence. The purpose is to demonstrate that implementations
   of the congestion control solutions are feasible and that the video
   quality behavior under the above test scenarios is as desired.

   The following provides some details about test sequences,
   configuration and quality assessment.

2.4.1. Test Sequences

   Content types: video telephony and conferencing

   Length: 100 seconds

   VGA resolution or higher

   Frame rate is 15fps or higher

   File based feed for repeatability

2.4.2. Configuration

   Video codec: up to proponent (AVC/H.264, VP8, HEVC/H.265, VP9, etc.)

   Error resiliency and concealment mechanisms: allowed

   Traffic shaping: allowed

   Proponents would be required to implement the congestion control
   method exactly as proposed and deliver the target bitrate directly to
   the video encoder's rate control without further processing. The
   reasoning is that if extra processing is required, then this should
   be part of the congestion control method under evaluation.

   The video encoder's rate control must achieve the target bit rate
   with reasonable accuracy and speed, which could be defined if
   necessary.

   The source code is to be provided for cross checking by non-
   proponents with the exception of proprietary modules that are not
   directly relevant for the evaluation.

2.5. Video Quality Assessment

   Since the purpose is to determine that the video quality behavior of
   the RMCAT solutions is as desired under the described test scenarios,
   it is proposed that the assessment is performed by a panel of experts
   that are non-proponents, for example, five experts. The experts
   report undesired video quality behaviors of the proposed RMCAT
   solutions. Alternatively, formal subjective quality testing (MOS) can
   be performed, if the MOS results are determined to be useful in the
   decision process.

3. Double Bottleneck Test Scenario

   This part of the document describes an additional test scenario for
   network traffic evaluation (not video quality).

   In this scenario, which is based on [2], one media flow encounters
   two bottleneck links that are each shared with a second but different
   flow. Figure 1 depicts the test setup. Each source Si sends a flow to
   its corresponding receiver Ri. The second bottleneck is more
   restricted than the first. The purpose is to evaluate the congestion
   control's rate distribution among the flows under these asymmetric
   conditions.

3.1. Configuration

   Topology:

   o  Two sequential bottleneck links (Figure 1)

   o  Three RMCAT senders and receivers

   First bottleneck link speed is 1.5Mbps

   Second bottleneck link speed is 1Mbps

   One-way propagation delay per link: 10ms

   Bottleneck queue type: drop-tail

   Bottleneck queue size: 32 packets

   Random loss rate over link: 0%
