Internet-Draft           application/stream+json            October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Activity Streams [asms] is a data format for "the serialization of a
   stream of social activities using the JSON format" [RFC4627].
   Version 1.0 of the specification was published in May of 2011 by the
   Activity Streams Working Group (<http://activitystrea.ms>) and has
   been implemented in a broad range of applications.

   This specification defines and registers the "application/
   stream+json" Content Type to represent JSON document resources that
   conform to the JSON Activity Streams version 1.0 Specification,
   Section 4.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers the application/stream+json MIME Media
   Type:

      Type name: application
      Subtype name: stream+json
      Required parameters: None
      Optional parameters: "charset" : Specifies the character set
      encoding.  If not specified, a default of "UTF-8" is assumed.
      Encoding considerations: Resources that use the "application/
      stream+json" media type are required to conform to the
      "application/json" Media Type and are therefore subject to the
      same encoding considerations specified in Section 6 [RFC4627].
      Security considerations: As defined in this specification
      Published specification: This specification.
      Applications that use this media type: JSON Activity Streams are
      implemented by a wide range of existing applications.
