            draft-wu-avtcore-multisrc-endpoint-adver-00.txt

Abstract

   When two endpoints with multiple media sources are in communication,
   each media source or each receiver within either endpoint may send or
   receive reception report independently.  This may incur a lot of
   duplicated reception report to and from the endpoint with multiple
   sources.  This document discusses how to tackle these problems and
   propose three phases for suppressing reception reports.

1.  Introduction

   For some applications that use unicast transport, e.g., in RTCWeb
   application, an endpoint with multiple media sources (i.e.,multiple-
   source hosts, e.g., a client with several cameras) may use a
   different SSRC for each medium but sending them in the same RTP
   session, which reduces communication failure due to NAT and firewall
   when using multiple RTP sessions or transport flows.

   However when two endpoints with multiple media sources are in
   communication, each media source within either endpoint may send
   reception report independently and the receiving endpoint may not
   know the reception reports received from different media source are
   from the same sending endpoint.  This creates the following three
   problems:

   o  An endpoint with multiple media sources involved in one RTP
      session may send the reception report with duplicated information
      about the same remote media source from each of local media
      sources.

   o  An endpoint with multiple media sources involved in one RTP
      session may receive the reception report with duplicated
      information about the same local media source from each of remote
      media sources.

   o  An endpoint with multiple media sources involved in one RTP
      session also may send reception reports about one of its own media
      sources from another of its own (This is also referred to as RTCP
      self-reporting).  Such reception reports cause additional traffic
      travelling over the link between sending endpoints and receiving
      endpoint, which may cause network congestion issue and affect the
      media qualities.

   This document discusses how to tackle these problems.  Three phases
   for suppressing reception reports are proposed.

   o  Grouping of media sources originate from a single endpoint and
      classifying these media sources into multiple groups.

   o  Electing one single SSRC for reception report sending and one
      single SSRC for reception report monitoring based on local policy.

   o  Advertising the SSRC that is used either for reception report
      sending or reception report monitoring.

3.  Protocol Overview

   In order to suppress unnecessary reception reports to and from multi-
   source endpoint, multi-source endpoint should group media sources
   originating from a single endpoint and elect one or a set of
   specified SSRCs for reception report processing (e.g., reception
   report sending, reception report receiving and reception report
   monitoring).

3.1.  Report Source Grouping

   When an endpoint with multiple sources multiplexes multiple media
   types in the same RTP session, the media source originating from the
   same endpoint should be grouped together.  Similarly the endpoint
   with multiple sources may have multiple one or more than one report
   source for monitoring.  These report sources for monitoring should
   also be grouped together.  Therefore an endpoint with multiple
   sources should at least split all its own media sources or receivers
   into two groups(i.e., split SSRCs into two groups): One is sending
   group, the other is monitoring group.  Each group may have one or
   several group members.  Each group member is identified by a
   different SSRC.

3.2.  Report Source Election

   When grouping for each endpoint with multiple sources is available,
   in order to prevent group members receiving duplicated data, one or
   more than one group member MUST be elected from sending group as
   report source for reception report sending.  When one report source
   leaves the session or is down, another candidate report source can
   replace instead.  If the monitoring is used, each endpoint with
   multiple sources MUST have at least one report source for monitoring
   purpose.  One or more than one reporting sources MUST be selected
   from monitoring group for monitoring use.

   Each endpoint with multiple sources at least has one SSRC for
   reception report sending.  If the monitoring is used, the endpoint
   with multiple sources should choose another SSRC from monitoring
   group as monitoring report source.

3.3.  Report Source Advertisement

   When report sources are elected for reception report sending, and
   monitoring purpose respectively, it is necessary to signal which
   report source is used for which purpose.

   One way is to define three new SDES items to advertise the reporting
   sources from endpoint with multiple sources that are used for

   reception report sending, receiving and monitoring respectively (See
   section 5.1 and section 5.2 for protocol format details).

4.  Consideration for Session member numbers updating

   As described in section 6.2.1 of RFC3550, Calculation of the RTCP
   packet interval mainly depends upon the number of members.  For an
   endpoint with multiple sources in communication with another endpoint
   with multiple sources, it is more desirable to set the number of
   sender for such endpoint as one and the number of receiver as one.
   However according to RFC3550, each source within such endpoint is
   considered valid until multiple packets carrying the new SSRC have
   been received, or until an SDES RTCP packet containing a CNAME for
   that SSRC has been received.  In order to invalid the source that are
   not elected as report source, it is necessary to define new SDES item
   to indicate other sources that are not chosen as report sources(See
   section 5.4 for more details).  Also we can define an RTP header
   extension [RFC5285] to indicate the other sources that are not chosen
   as report sources(See section 5.4 for more details).This extension
   can be sent by the endpoint with multiple sources either at the
   beginning of the RTP session or in the middle of the RTP session.
   Another way is to use RTCP NACK packet [RFC4585] to suppress the
   unnecessary reception report from an endpoint with multiple sources.
   The NACK can be sent by the endpoint with multiple source when the
   endpoint with multiple sources is aware of reception report
   duplication.

5.  Protocol formats

5.1.  SDES item for Reception Report Sending

   This sub-section defines the format of the Reception Report Sending
   SDES item.  The SDES item is carried in the RTCP SDES packet.  The
   packet format for the RTCP SDES is defined in Section 6.5 of
   [RFC3550].  Each SDES packet is composed of a header with fixed-
   length fields for version, source count, packet type (PT), and
   length, followed by zero or more chunks.  Each chunk consists of an
   SSRC/CSRC identifier followed by zero or more SDES items.  In the
   SDES packet, the PT field is set to SDES(202).

5.1.1.  RRS: Reception Report Sending SDES Item

        0                   1                   2                   3

       |   ....
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Reception Report Sending Item is not mandatory item and intended
   for indicating the elected report source for an endpoint with
   multiple sources, which is responsible for reception report sending.
   The SSRC/CSRC identifier included in the same chunk (at the beginning
   of this chunk) as the item is the SSRC of elected sending report
   source.  Additionally, this item may carry one or more than one
   Candidate Report Source SSRCs.  The candidate Report Source SSRC
   follows the same format as SSRC/CSRC identifier defined in RFC3550.
   Its length is described by the length field.  The value of the length
   field does not include the two octet SDES item header.  This item
   MUST be ignored by applications that are not configured to make use
   of it.

5.2.  SDES item for Reception Report Monitoring

   This sub-section defines the format of the Reception Report
   Monitoring SDES item.  The SDES item is carried in the RTCP SDES
   packet.  The packet format for the RTCP SDES is defined in Section
   6.5 of [RFC3550].Each SDES packet is composed of a header with fixed-
   length fields for version, source count, packet type (PT), and
   length, followed by zero or more chunks.  Each chunk consists of an
   SSRC/CSRC identifier followed by zero or more SDES items.  In the
   SDES packet, the PT field is set to SDES(202).

       |   ....
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Reception Report Sending Item is not mandatory item and intended
   for indicating the report source for an endpoint, which is
   responsible for reception report monitoring.  The SSRC/CSRC
   identifier included in the same chunk as the item (at the beginning
   of this chunk) is the SSRC of elected sending report source.
   Additionally, this item may carry one or more than one Candidate
   Report Source SSRCs.  The candidate Report Source SSRC follows the
   same format as SSRC/CSRC identifier defined in RFC3550.  Its length
   is described by the length field.  The value of the length field does
   not include the two octet SDES item header.  This item MUST be
   ignored by applications that are not configured to make use of it.

5.3.  SDES item for Invalid Report Source list

   This sub-section defines the format of the Invalid Report Source list
   SDES item.  The SDES item is carried in the RTCP SDES packet.  The
   packet format for the RTCP SDES is defined in Section 6.5 of
   [RFC3550].  Each SDES packet is composed of a header with fixed-
   length fields for version, source count, packet type (PT), and
   length, followed by zero or more chunks.  Each chunk consists of an
   SSRC/CSRC identifier followed by zero or more SDES items.  In the
   SDES packet, the PT field is set to SDES(202).

5.3.1.  IRSL: Invalid Report Source List SDES Item

        0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |   ....
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Invalid Report Source list Item is not mandatory item and
   intended for indicating the invalid report source(s) for an endpoint
   with multiple sources.  The invalid Report Source is one that is not
   elected as report source for an endpoint with multiple sources and
   SHOULD not be counted as session member or RTP packet sender if

   multiplexing multiple media type in the same RTP session is used.
   This item may carry one or more than one invalid Report Source SSRCs.
   The invalid Report Source SSRC follows the same format as SSRC/CSRC
   identifier defined in RFC3550.  Its length is described by the length
   field.  The value of the length field does not include the two octet
   SDES item header.  The SSRC/CSRC identifier field at the beginning of
   the chunk is the SSRC of one elected report source from multiple
   source for the same endpoint.  This item MUST be ignored by
   applications that are not configured to make use of it.

5.4.  RTP header extension for Invalid Report Source list

   This sub-section defines the format of RTP header extension
   [RFC5285]for carrying a list of Invalid Report Sources.  The RTP
   header extension is composed of a header with fixed-length fields for
   the fixed bit pattern "0x1000", and length, followed by zero or more
   extension elements.  Each extension element is followed by one two
   type header and one Invalid Report Source for an endpoint with
   multiple sources.  The invalid report source is carried in 32 bit
   field and identified using SSRC.

6.  Security Considerations

   RTCP reports or RTP header extension elements can contain sensitive
   information, including information about report source grouping for
   endpoint with multiple source and member of a session established
   between two or more endpoints.  Therefore, the use of security
   mechanisms with RTP, as documented in Section 9 of [RFC3550] applies.
   In addition, the RTP header extension elements can be protected using
   mechanisms defined in [I-D.ietf-avtcore-srtp-encrypted-header-ext].
