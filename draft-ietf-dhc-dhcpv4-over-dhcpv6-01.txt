1.  Introduction

   As the migration towards IPv6 continues, IPv6 only networks will
   become more prevalent.  However, IPv4 connectivity will continue to
   be provided as a service over these IPv6 only networks.  In addition
   to providing IPv4 addresses for clients of this service, other IPv4
   configuration parameters may also need to be provided, (e.g.
   addresses of IPv4-only services).

   By conveying DHCPv4 messages over DHCPv6 transport, this mechanism
   can achieve dynamic provisioning of IPv4 address and other
   configuration parameters.  In addition, it is able to leverage
   existing infrastructure for DHCPv4, e.g. failover, DNS updates,
   leasequery, etc.  This mechanism is suitable for stateful allocation
   and management of IPv4 addresses and configuration parameters across
   IPv6 networks.

   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   DHCP client:          The 'DHCP client' in this document consists of
                         both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 client engines.  The
                         client is able to request IPv6 information
                         through DHCPv6, as well as to request IPv4
                         information using DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 transport.

   4o6 Server:           A DHCP server capable of processing DHCPv4
                         packets wrapped in the BOOTP Message Option
                         (defined below).

   DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6:   A protocol described in this document, which is
                         used to carry DHCPv4 messages encapsulated in
                         DHCPv6 messages.

4.  New DHCPv6 Messages

   The following new DHCPv6 Client/Server messages are defined by this
   document.  These are formatted as specified in Section 6 of
   [RFC3315].

   BOOTREQUESTV6 (TBD):  A client sends a BOOTREQUESTV6 message to a
                         server, which contains a BOOTP Message Option.
                         The BOOTP Message Option contains a BOOTREQUEST
                         message that the client uses to request IPv4
                         configuration parameters from the server.

   BOOTREPLYV6 (TBD):    A server sends a BOOTREPLYV6 message containing
                         a BOOTP Message Option in response to a
                         client's BOOTREQUESTV6 message.  The BOOTP
                         Message Option contains a BOOTREPLY message in
                         response to a BOOTREQUEST received by the
                         server in the BOOTP Message Option of a
                         BOOTREQUESTV6 message.

5.  Architecture Overview

   The architecture described in this document addresses a typical use
   case, whereby a DHCP client's uplink supports IPv6 only and the
   Service Provider's network supports IPv6 and limited IPv4 services.
   In this scenario, the client can only use the IPv6 network to access
   IPv4 services and so it must configure IPv4 services using IPv6 as
   the underlying transport protocol.

Internet-Draft             DHCPv4 over DHCPv6                  July 2013


   Although the purpose of this document is to address the problem of
   communication between DHCPv4 client and DHCPv4 server, the mechanism
   it describes does not restrict the transported types of messages to
   DHCPv4.  BOOTP messages can be transported using the same mechanism.

   DHCP clients can be running on CPE devices, end hosts or any other
   device which supports the DHCP client function.  At the time of
   writing, DHCP clients on CPE devices are relatively easier to modify
   compared to those implemented on end hosts.  As a result, this
   document uses the CPE as an example for describing the mechanism.
   This doesn't preclude end hosts from implementing the mechanism in
   the future.

   This mechanism works by carrying encapsulated DHCPv4 messages over
   DHCPv6 messages.  Figure 1, below, illustrates one possible
   deployment architecture.

   The DHCP client implements a new DHCPv6 message called BOOTREQUESTV6,
   which contains a new option called BOOTP Message Option.  The format
   of the option is described in Section 6.1.

   The DHCPv6 packet can be transmitted either via Relay Agents or
   directly to the 4o6 Server.  The server replies with a relevant
   DHCPv6 packet carrying DHCPv4 response wrapped with the BOOTP Message
   Option.

   The DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 is by default disabled on the client.  Before
   client can use this protocol it MUST obtain configuration using
   DHCPv6 as described in [RFC3315].  During this configuration, server
   MAY include DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 Enable Option in its Reply message to
   indicate that client SHOULD use DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 protocol to obtain
   additional configuration.  The format of the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6
   Enable Option is described in Section 6.2

   Typically, client communicates with the 4o6 Servers using well known
   All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.  If DHCPv6
   server is configured to do so, it MAY send unicast addresses of the
   4o6 Servers to the client during client's configuration using DHCPv6.
   The unicast addresses are carried in the 4o6 Server Addresses Option
   encapsulated in the Reply message.  The 4o6 Server Addresses Option's
   format is defined in Section 6.3.

6.  DHCPv6 Options

6.1.  BOOTP Message Option Format

   The BOOTP Message option carries a BOOTP message that is sent by the
   client or the server.  Such BOOTP messages exclude any IP or UDP
   headers.

   The format of the BOOTP Message Option is:

     0                   1                   2                   3

                   contains a BOOTREPLY message sent by a server in
                   response to a client.

6.2.  DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 Enable Option Format

   The DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 Enable Option indicates that the client SHOULD
   enable the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 function.

   The format of the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 Enable Option is:

7.  Client Behavior

   The DHCP client SHOULD request the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 Enable Option
   and the 4o6 Server Addresses Option in the Option Request Option
   (ORO) to launch the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 function.

   Client MUST NOT initiate communication with 4o6 Servers before it

   obtains configuration using DHCPv6 as described in [RFC3315].  If
   client supports DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 function it SHOULD request the
   DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 Enable Option and 4o6 Server Addresses Option in
   the Option Request Option (ORO).  DHCPv6 server MAY include these
   options in Reply message sent to the client.  The client determines
   how to launch the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 function using the presence /
   absence of these two options:

   o  If the client doesn't receive the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 Enable
      Option, it SHOULD NOT enable the DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 function.

   o  If the client receives the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 Enable Option but no
      4o6 Servers Address Option, it SHOULD enable the DHCPv4-over-
      DHCPv6 function, but use IPv6 multicast to communicate with the
      servers or relays as described above.

   o  If the client receives both options, it SHOULD enable the DHCPv4
      -over-DHCPv6 function, and send requests to all unicast addresses
      conveyed by the 4o6 Server Addresses Option.

   If client is instructed by the DHCPv6 server to use DHCPv4-over-
   DHCPv6 function it MUST generate a DHCPv4 message to obtain
   configuration from the 4o6 Server.  This message is stored verbatim
   in the BOOTP Message Option carried by the BOOTREQUESTV6 message.
   Client MUST put exactly one BOOTP Message Option into a single
   BOOTREQUESTV6 message.

   If client did not receive a 4o6 Server Addresses Option from the
   DHCPv6 server, it transmits the BOOTREQUESTV6 message as specified in
   Section 13 of [RFC3315].  If client received this option it MUST send
   BOOTREQUESTV6 message to all unicast addresses listed in the received
   option.

   When a client receives a BOOTREPLYV6 message, it MUST look for the
   BOOTP Message Option within this message.  If this option is not
   found, the BOOTREPLYV6 message is discarded.  If the BOOTP Message
   Option is found, the client extracts the DHCPv4 message it contains
   and processes it as described in section 4.4 of [RFC2131].

   DHCP clients are responsible for the retransmission of messages.
   When requesting IPv4 information, the client SHOULD follow the normal
   DHCPv4 retransmission requirements and strategy as specified in
   section 4.1 of [RFC2131].  As a result there are no explicit
   transmission parameters associated with a BOOTPREQUESTV6 message.

   As the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 clients are running on the same host, the
   client MUST implement [RFC4361] to ensure that the device correctly
   identifies itself.

   The IPv4 address allocated from the server MAY be assigned to a
   different interface from the IPv6 interface requesting the
   information.  Future documents depending on this memo MUST specify
   which IPv6 interface is to be used by the client for that purpose.

8.  Relay Agent Behavior

   When a DHCPv6 relay agent receives a BOOTREQUESTV6 message, it MUST
   handle the message as described in section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-unknown-msg].

   A DHCPv6 relay agent MUST implement the Relay behaviour described in
   section 20.1.1 of [RFC3315].

   Additionally, the DHCPv6 relay agent MAY allow the configuration of
   dedicated DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 specific destination addresses,
   differing from the addresses of the DHCPv6 only server(s).  To
   implement this function, the relay checks the received DHCPv6 message
   type and forwards according to the following logic:

   1.  If the message type is BOOTREQUESTV6, then the DHCPv6 request is
       relayed to the configured DHCPv4 aware 4o6 Server's address(es).

   2.  For any other DHCPv6 message type, forward according to section
       20 of [RFC3315].

   The above logic only allows for separate relay destinations
   configured on the relay agent closest to the client (single relay
   hop).  Multiple relaying hops are not considered in the case of
   separate relay destinations.

9.  Server Behavior

   When server receives a BOOTREQUESTV6 message from a client, it
   searches for a BOOTP Message Option.  If this option is missing, the
   server discards the packet.  The server MAY notify an administrator
   about the receipt of a malformed packet.  The mechanism for this
   notification is out of scope for this document

   If the server finds a valid BOOTP Message Option, it extracts the
   original DHCPv4 message sent by the client.  This message is passed
   to the DHCPv4 server engine, which generates a response to the client
   as specified in [RFC2131].  This engine can be implemented as a
   built-in DHCPv4 server function of the 4o6 Server, or it can be a
   separate DHCPv4 server instance.  Discussion regarding communication
   between the 4o6 Server and a DHCPv4 server engine is out of scope for
   this document.

Internet-Draft             DHCPv4 over DHCPv6                  July 2013


   When appropriate DHCPv4 response is generated, 4o6 Server places it
   in the payload of a BOOTP Message Option, which it puts into the
   BOOTREPLYV6 message.

   If the BOOTREQUESTV6 message was received directly by the server, the
   BOOTREPLYV6 message MUST be unicast from the interface on which the
   original message was received.

   If the BOOTREQUESTV6 message was received in a Relay-forward message,
   the server creates a Relay-reply message with the BOOTREPLYV6 message
   in the payload of a Relay Message Option, and responds as described
   in section 20.3 of [RFC3315].

10.  Security Considerations

   In this specification, DHCPv4 messages are encapsulated in the newly
   defined option and messages.  This is similar to handling the current
   relay agent messages.  In order to bypass firewalls or network
   authentication gateways, a malicious attacker may leverage this
   feature to convey other messages using DHCPv6, i.e. use DHCPv6 as a
   form of encapsulation.  However, the potential risk from this is no
   greater than that with current DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 practice.

11.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is kindly requested to allocate three DHCPv6 option codes to the
   OPTION_BOOTP_MSG, OPTION_DHCP4_O_DHCP6_ENABLE and
   OPTION_DHCP4_O_DHCP6_SERVERS, and two DHCPv6 message type codes to
   the BOOTREQUESTV6 and BOOTREPLYV6.
