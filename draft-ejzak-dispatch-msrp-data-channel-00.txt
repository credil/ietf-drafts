                     MSRP over WebRTC data channels
               draft-ejzak-dispatch-msrp-data-channel-00

Abstract

   This document specifies how the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
   can be instantiated as a WebRTC data channel sub-protocol, using the
   the SDP offer/answer exchange-based external negotiation defined in
   [I-D.ejzak-dispatch-webrtc-data-channel-sdpneg].  Two network
   configurations are documented: a WebRTC end-to-end configuration
   (connecting two MSRP over data channel endpoints), and a gateway
   configuration (connecting an MSRP over data channel endpoint with an
   MSRP over TCP endpoint).

1.  Introduction

   The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) [RFC4975] is a protocol for
   transmitting a series of related instant messages in the context of a
   session.  In addition to instant messaging, MSRP can also be used for
   image sharing or file transfer.  MSRP is currently defined to work
   over TCP and TLS connections.

   This document defines the negotiation and transport of this MSRP
   protocol over WebRTC data channels, where a data channel is a bi-
   directional communication channel running on top of SCTP/DTLS (as per
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol]) and where MSRP is instantiated as a
   sub-protocol of this data channel.

Internet-Draft       MSRP over WebRTC data channels         October 2013


   Defining MSRP as a data channel sub-protocol has many benefits:

   o  provides to WebRTC applications a proven protocol enabling instant
      messaging, file transfer, image sharing

   o  integrates those features with other RTCWeb voice, video and data
      features

   o  leverages the SDP-based negotiation already defined for MSRP

   o  allows the interworking with MSRP endpoints running on a TCP or
      TLS connection

   Considering an MSRP endpoint being an MSRP WebRTC application, this
   document describes two configurations where the other endpoint is
   respectively either another MSRP over data channel endpoint (e.g., a
   WebRTC application) or an MSRP endpoint using either TCP or TLS
   transport.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

      Data channel: A bidirectional channel consisting of paired SCTP
      outbound and inbound streams.

      External negotiation: data channel negotiation based on out-of-
      band or in-band mechanisms other than the WebRTC data channel
      control protocol.

      In-band: transmission through the peer-to-peer SCTP association.

      Out-of-band: transmission through the WebRTC signaling path, e.g.,
      using JSEP [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-jsep] and the SDP Offer/Answer model
      [RFC3264].

      MSRP data channel: A data channel specifically used to transport
      the messages of one MSRP session.

      Peer: From the perspective of one of the agents in a session, its
      peer is the other agent.  Specifically, from the perspective of
      the SDP offerer, the peer is the SDP answerer.  From the
      perspective of the SDP answerer, the peer is the SDP offerer.

4.  Principles

4.1.  MSRP data channel

   In this document, an MSRP data channel is a WebRTC data channel for
   which the instantiated sub-protocol is MSRP, and where the MSRP-
   related negotiation is done as part of the SDP-based external
   negotiation method defined in
   [I-D.ejzak-dispatch-webrtc-data-channel-sdpneg].

4.2.  Session mapping

   In this design, the MSRP connection maps to the SCTP association and
   the port assigned to data channels, and each MSRP session maps to one
   data channel exactly.

4.3.  MSRP URI

   This document extends the MSRP URI syntax [RFC4975] by defining the
   new transport parameter value "dc":

   transport  =  "tcp" / "dc" / 1*ALPHANUM


4.4.  msrp-scheme

   The msrp-scheme portion of the MSRP-URI that represents an MSRP data
   channel endpoint (used in the SDP path attribute and in the MSRP
   message headers) is always "MSRPS", which indicates that the MSRP
   data channel is always secured using DTLS.

5.  End-to-end configuration

   This section describes the network configuration where each MSRP
   endpoint is running MSRP over an SCTP/DTLS (data channel) connection.

Internet-Draft       MSRP over WebRTC data channels         October 2013


5.1.1.  Session negotiation

5.1.1.1.  Use of webrtc-DataChannel attribute

   The SDP offer shall include a webrtc-DataChannel attribute line
   (defined in [I-D.ejzak-dispatch-webrtc-data-channel-sdpneg]), within
   the m line for the SCTP association for each MSRP data channel
   session to be negotiated.

   The attribute includes the following data channel parameters:

   o  "stream=" streamidentifier

   o  "label=" labelstring

   o  "subprotocol=" "MSRP"

   The streamidentifier and labelstring are set by the MSRP application
   according to [I-D.ejzak-dispatch-webrtc-data-channel-sdpneg].  The
   max_retr, max_time and unordered parameters shall not be used.

   The SDP answer shall include the exact same attribute line to
   indicate acceptance of the data channel instance.

   The following is an example of the webrtc-DataChannel attribute for
   an MSRP session to be negotiated on SCTP port 5000 with stream=2 and
   label="chat":

   a=webrtc-DataChannel:5000 stream=2;label="chat"; subprotocol="MSRP"


5.1.1.2.  Use of wdcsa attribute

   The SDP offer shall also include a wdcsa attribute line (defined in
   [I-D.ejzak-dispatch-webrtc-data-channel-sdpneg]) within the m line
   for the SCTP association for each MSRP-specific SDP attribute to be
   negotiated for each MSRP data channel being negotiated.  Note that
   the syntax allows for the attributes associated with multiple MSRP
   data channels (as well as attributes associated with other
   subprotocols) to be represented within a single m line.

   The MSRP-specific items that can be negotiated include at least all
   of the following well-known attributes:

   o  defined in [RFC4975]: "path", "accept-types", "accept-wrapped-
      types", "max-size"

Internet-Draft       MSRP over WebRTC data channels         October 2013


   o  defined in [RFC4566]: "sendonly", "recvonly", "inactive", and
      "sendrecv"

   o  defined in [RFC6135]: "setup"

   o  defined in [RFC6714]: "msrp-cema"

   o  defined in [RFC5547]: all the parameters related to MSRP file
      transfer.  See Section 5.2.

   The msrp-cema attribute shall be assumed to be present for every MSRP
   session using data channel transport, so the inclusion of the msrp-
   cema attribute is optional.  This ensures that the data channel
   transport for the MSRP session is established without using the path
   attribute.

   The SDP answer shall include zero or more corresponding wdcsa
   attribute lines for each negotiated MSRP session, according to the
   MSRP-specific attribute negotiation rules in the corresponding
   specifications.

5.1.1.3.  Example SDP negotiation

   The following is an example of an m line for DataChannels in an SDP
   offer that includes the attributes needed to establish two MSRP
   sessions: one for chat and one for file transfer.  The example is
   derived from a combination of examples in [RFC4975] and [RFC5547].

   a=wdcsa:5000:2 file-range:1-32349


5.1.2.  Session opening

   The active MSRP endpoint does not use the path attribute to open a
   transport connection to its peer.  Instead, it uses the data channel
   established for this MSRP session by the generic data channel opening
   procedure defined in [I-D.ejzak-dispatch-webrtc-data-channel-sdpneg].

   As soon as this data channel is opened, the MSRP session is actually
   opened by the active MSRP endpoint which sends an MSRP SEND message
   (empty or not) to the other MSRP endpoint.  The msrp-cema attribute
   is implicitly associated with every MSRP session using data channel
   transport.

5.1.3.  Data framing

   Each text-based MSRP message is sent on the corresponding SCTP stream
   using standard MSRP framing and chunking procedures, as defined in
   [RFC4975], with each MSRP chunk delivered in a single SCTP user
   message.

5.1.4.  Data sending and reporting

   Data sending and reporting procedures shall conform to RFC 4975.

5.1.5.  Session closing

Internet-Draft       MSRP over WebRTC data channels         October 2013


   Either endpoint can close the MSRP session by closing the underlying
   data channel, using the generic data channel closing procedure
   defined in [I-D.ejzak-dispatch-webrtc-data-channel-sdpneg].  Closing
   an MSRP session should trigger an SDP negotiation where the SDP
   attributes for each affected data channel are removed.

   The port value for the m line should not be changed (e.g., to zero)
   when closing an MSRP session (unless all data channels are being
   closed and the SCTP association is no longer needed), since this
   would close the SCTP association and impact all of the data channels.
   In all cases in [RFC4975] where the procedure calls for setting the
   port to zero for the MSRP m line in an SDP offer for TCP transport,
   the SDP offerer of an MSRP session with data channel transport shall
   remove the corresponding webRTC-DataChannel and wdcsa attributes.

   The SDP answerer must ensure that no webRTC-DataChannel or wdcsa
   attributes are present in the SDP answer if no corresponding
   attributes are present in the received SDP offer.

5.2.  Support for MSRP File Transfer function

   [RFC5547] defines an end-to-end file transfer method based on MSRP
   and the SDP offer/answer mechanism.  This file transfer method is
   also usable by MSRP WebRTC endpoints, with the following
   considerations:

   o  As an MSRP session maps to one data channel, a file transfer
      session maps also to one data channel.

   o  SDP attributes specified in [RFC5547] for a file transfer m-line
      are embedded as subprotocol-specific attributes using the syntax
      defined in [I-D.ejzak-dispatch-webrtc-data-channel-sdpneg].

   o  Once the file transfer is complete, the same data channel MAY be
      reused for another file transfer.

6.  Gateway configuration

   This section describes the network configuration where one endpoint
   runs MSRP over a WebRTC SCTP/DTLS connection, the other MSRP endpoint
   runs MSRP over one or more TLS/TCP connections, and the two endpoints
   interwork via an MSRP gateway.

Internet-Draft       MSRP over WebRTC data channels         October 2013


   Specifically, a gateway can be configured to interwork an MSRP
   session using a data channel with a peer that does not support data
   channel transport in one of two ways.  In one model, the gateway
   performs as a MSRP B2BUA to interwork all the procedures as necessary
   between the endpoints.  No further specification is needed for this
   model.

   Alternately, the gateway can use CEMA procedures to provide transport
   level interworking between MSRP endpoints using different transport
   protocols as follows.

   When the gateway performs transport level interworking between MSRP
   endpoints, all of the procedures in Section 5 apply to each peer,
   with the following additions:

   o  The endpoint establishing an MSRP session using data channel
      transport shall not request inclusion of any relays, although it
      may interoperate with a peer that signals the use of relays.

   o  The gateway receiving an SDP offer that includes a request to
      negotiate an MSRP session on a data channel can provide transport
      level interworking in the same manner as a CEMA SBC by forwarding
      TCP or TLS transport parameters in a new m line with the
      appropriate attributes within the forwarded SDP offer.

   o  Similarly, a gateway receiving an SDP offer to negotiate an MSRP
      session using TCP or TLS transport with an endpoint that only
      supports data channel transport for MSRP can provide transport
      level interworking in the same manner as a CEMA SBC by
      establishing a new data channel for the MSRP session with the
      target endpoint.
