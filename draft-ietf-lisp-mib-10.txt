1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   This draft describes the Management Information Base (MIB) module for
   use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   Specifically, the MIB for managing Locator/ID Separation Protocol
   (LISP) devices is described.

   LISP [RFC6830] specifies a network-based architecture and mechanisms
   that implement a new semantic for IP addressing using two separate
   name spaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), used within sites, and
   Routing Locators (RLOCs), used on the transit networks that make up
   the Internet infrastructure.  To achieve this separation, LISP
   defines protocol mechanisms for mapping from EIDs to RLOCs.

   From a data plane perspective, LISP traffic is handled exclusively at
   the network layer by devices performing Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR)
   and Egress Tunnel Router (ETR) LISP functions.  Data plane operations
   performed by these devices are described in [RFC6830].  Additionally,
   data plane interworking between legacy (Internet) and LISP sites is
   implemented by devices performing Proxy ITR (PITR) and Proxy ETR
   (PETR) functions.  The data plane operations of these devices is
   described in [RFC6832].

   From a control plane perspective, LISP employs mechanisms related to
   creating, maintaining, and resolving mappings from EIDs to RLOCs.
   LISP ITRs, ETRs, PITRs, and PETRs perform specific control plane
   functions, and these control plane operations are described in
   [RFC6830].  Additionally, LISP infrastructure devices supporting LISP
   control plane functionality include Map-Servers and Map-Resolvers,
   and the control plane operations of these devices are described in
   [RFC6833].

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

Internet-Draft                  LISP MIB                        May 2013


   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   o  Provide a means for obtaining an ON/OFF list of LISP features
      configured on a device, and the current status of configuration
      attributes related to those features.  As an example, LISP
      features that could be enabled might include ITR, ETR, PITR, PETR,
      MS or MR support for IPv4 or IPv6 address families.  Other
      examples could include indicating whether rloc-probing is enabled,
      or whether the use of a PETR is enabled.  Configuration attributes
      related to these features could include the setting of a
      configured map-cache limit value, or the setting of a mapping
      time-to-live value.

   o  Provide a means for obtaining the current attributes of various
      LISP tables, such as the EID-to-RLOC policy data contained in the
      Map-Cache, or the local EID-to-RLOC policy data contained in the
      Mapping-Database.

   o  Provide a means for obtaining the current operational statistics
      of various LISP functions, such as the number of packets
      encapsulated and decapsulated by the device.  Other counters of
      operational interest, depending on LISP function, include things
      like the current number of map-cache entries, and the total number
      and rate of map-requests received and sent by the device.

6.  Structure of LISP MIB Module

6.1.  Overview of Defined Notifications

   No LISP MIB notifications are defined.

6.2.  Overview of Defined Tables

   The LISP MIB module is composed of the following tables of objects:

   lispFeatures -  This table provides information representing the
      various lisp features that can be enabled on LISP devices.

   lispIidToVrf -  This table provides information representing the
      mapping of a LISP instance ID to a VRF (Virtual Routing/
      Forwarding).

   lispGlobalStats -  This table provides global statistics for a given
      Instance ID per address-family on a LISP device.

   lispMappingDatabase -  This table represents the EID-to-RLOC database
      that contains the EID-prefix to RLOC mappings configured on an
      ETR.  In general, this table would be representative of all such
      mappings for a given site that this device belongs to.

    DESCRIPTION
        "LISP architecture can be applied to a wide variety of
         address-families. This textual-convention is a
         generalization for representing addresses that belong to
         those address-families. For convenience, this document
         refers to any such address as a LISP address.
         LispAddressType textual-convention consists of the
         following four-tuple:
          1. IANA Address Family Number: A field of length 2-octets,
             whose value is of the form following the assigned
             AddressFamilyNumbers textual-convention described in
             [IANA]. The enumerations are listed in [IANA].  Note
             that this list of address family numbers is maintained
             by IANA.
          2. Length of LISP address: A field of length 1-octet, whose
             value indicates the octet-length of the next (third)

             field of this LispAddressType four-tuple.
          3. LISP address: A field of variable length as indicated in
             the previous (second) field, whose value is an address
             of the IANA Address Family indicated in the first field
             of this LispAddressType four-tuple.  Note that any of
             the IANA Address Families can be represented.
             Particularly when the address family is LISP Canonical
             Address Format (LCAF) [LCAF] with IANA assigned Address
             Family Number 16387, then the first octet of this field
             indicates the LCAF type, and the rest of this field is
             same as the encoding format of the LISP Canonical Address
             after the length field, as defined in [LCAF].
          4. Mask-length of address: A field of length 1-octet, whose
             value is the mask-length to be applied to the LISP
             address specified in the previous (third) field.

          To illustrate the use of this object, consider the LISP MIB
          Object below entitled lispMapCacheEntry. This object begins
          with the following entities:

          lispMapCacheEntry ::= SEQUENCE {
             lispMapCacheEidLength          INTEGER,
             lispMapCacheEid                LispAddressType,
              ... [skip] ...

          Example 1: Suppose that the IPv4 EID prefix stored is
          192.0.2.0/24. In this case, the values within
          lispMapCacheEntry would be:

             lispMapCacheEidLength  = 8
             lispMapCacheEid = 1, 4, 192.0.2.0, 24
             ... [skip] ...

          where 8 is the total length in octets of the next
          object (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType). Then,
          the value 1 indicates the IPv4 AF (per [IANA]), the
          value 4 indicates that the AF is 4-octets in length,
          192.0.2.0 is the IPv4 address, and the value 24 is the
          mask-length in bits. Note that the lispMapCacheEidLength
          value of 8 is used to compute the length of the fourth
          (last) field in lispMapCacheEid to be 1 octet - as
          computed by 8 - (2 + 1 + 4) = 1.

          Example 2: Suppose that the IPv6 EID prefix stored is
          2001:db8:a::/48. In this case, the values within
          lispMapCacheEntry would be:

             lispMapCacheEidLength  = 20

             lispMapCacheEid = 2, 16, 2001:db8:a::, 48
             ... [skip] ...

          where 20 is the total length in octets of the next
          object (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType). Then,
          the value 2 indicates the IPv4 AF (per [IANA]), the
          value 16 indicates that the AF is 16-octets in length,
          2001:db8:a:: is the IPv6 address, and the value 48 is the
          mask-length in bits. Note that the lispMapCacheEidLength
          value of 20 is used to compute the length of the fourth
          (last) field in lispMapCacheEid to be 1 octet - as
          computed by 20 - (2 + 1 + 16) = 1.

          Example 3: As an example where LCAF is used, suppose
          that the IPv4 EID prefix stored is 192.0.2.0/24 and it
          is part of LISP Instance ID 101. In this case, the values
          within lispMapCacheEntry would be:

             lispMapCacheEidLength  = 11
             lispMapCacheEid = 16387, 7, 2, 101, 1, 192.0.2.0, 24
             ... [skip] ...

          where 11 is the total length in octets of the next object
          (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType). Then, the value
          16387 indicates the LCAF AF (see [IANA]), the value 7
          indicates that the LCAF AF is 7-octets in length in this
          case, 2 indicates that LCAF Type 2 encoding is used (see
          [LCAF]), 101 gives the Instance ID, 1 gives the AFI (per
          [IANA]) for an IPv4 address, 192.0.2.0 is the IPv4 address,
          and 24 is the mask-length in bits. Note that the
          lispMapCacheEidLength value of 11 octets is used to compute
          the length of the last field in lispMapCacheEid to be 1 octet,
          as computed by 11 - (2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4) = 1."

8.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

8.1.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The LISP MIB imports the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION AddressFamilyNumbers from
   the IANA-ADDRESS-FAMILY-NUMBERS-MIB [IANA].

   The LISP MIB imports mib-2, Unsigned32, Counter64, Integer32, and
   TimeTicks from SNMPv2-SMI -- [RFC2578].

   The LISP MIB imports TruthValue, TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, TimeStamp, and
   TimeTicks from SNMPv2-TC -- [RFC2579].

   The LISP MIB imports MODULE-COMPLIANCE from SNMPv2-TC -- [RFC2580].

   The LISP MIB imports MplsL3VpnName from MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB --
   [RFC4382].

9.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  As long as
   these MIB modules are implemented correctly, there are no risks that
   any management objects of this MIB module can modify device settings
   via direct SNMP SET operations.



Schudel, et al.         Expires November 23, 2013              [Page 61]

Internet-Draft                  LISP MIB                        May 2013


   There are no readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with
   a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) that are considered
   sensitive.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:


              Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
              ----------        -----------------------

              lispMib            { mib-2 XXX }

   This document instructs IANA to allocate a new value in the "SMI
   Network Management MGMT Codes Internet-standard MIB" subregistry of
   the "Network Management Parameters" registry, according to the
   following registration data: Decimal: [TBD by IANA] Name: lispMIB
