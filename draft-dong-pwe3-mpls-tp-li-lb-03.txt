1.  Introduction

   The requirements for Lock Instruct (LI) and Loopback (LB) are
   specified in [RFC5860], and the framework of LI and LB is specified
   in [RFC6371].  [RFC6435] defines management plane based Lock Instruct
   (LI) and Loopback (LB) mechanisms, and an LI OAM message can be used
   for additional lock coordination between the MEPs.  Management plane
   based LI and LB is suitable for scenarios where dynamic control plane
   is not available.

   When a dynamic control plane is used for establishing MPLS-TP
   pseudowires (PWs), it's natural to use and extend the control plane
   protocol to provision LI and LB functions.  Unlike other OAM
   mechanisms, LI and LB would modify the forwarding plane of a PW, thus
   without the involvement of control plane this may result in
   inconsistency between control plane and data plane.  Besides, with
   control plane based mechanism, it does not need to rely on the TTL
   expiration to make the OAM requests reach particular MIP or MEP.

   There are some existing control plane based OAM provisioning
   mechanisms for MPLS-TP.  For example, [I-D.ietf-pwe3-oam-config]
   specifies the LDP extensions for the configuration of proactive OAM
   functions for MPLS-TP PWs when control plane is used.

Internet-Draft        LDP Extensions for PW LI&LB             April 2013


   This document defines mechanisms similar to
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-oam-config] to implement LI and LB functions for MPLS-
   TP PWs when MPLS-TP control plane is used.  The mechanisms defined in
   this document are complementary to [RFC6435].

2.  LDP Extensions

2.1.  Extensions to MPLS-TP PW OAM Administration TLV

   Two new flags (Lock bit and Loopback bit) are defined in MPLS-TP PW
   OAM Administration TLV [I-D.ietf-pwe3-oam-config].

   Format of extended MPLS-TP PW OAM Administration TLV is as below:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |0|0|          Type (TBD)     |            Length               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |I|A|K|B|                  Reserved                             |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Lock (K): When this bit is set, it indicates that the T-PE needs to
   enable "Lock" function for this PW.

   Loopback (B): When this bit is set, it indicates that the target node
   of this message SHOULD enable loopback function for this PW.

2.2.  Extensions to PW Status TLV

   Two new Status bits are defined in PW Status TLV:

   Bit Mask     Description
   ====================================================================
   TBD1         Pseudowire in Lock Mode                 [this document]
   TBD2         Pseudowire in Loopback Mode             [this document]


3.  Operations

   The control plane based Lock Instruct and Loopback functions are
   applicable to both Single-Segment Pseudowire (SS-PW) [RFC3985]
   [RFC4447] and Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) [RFC5659] [RFC6073].

3.1.  Lock Instruct





Dong, et al.            Expires October 20, 2013                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        LDP Extensions for PW LI&LB             April 2013


   When a PE/T-PE wants to put a PW into lock mode, it MUST send a
   Mapping message with the Lock (K) bit in the MPLS-TP PW OAM
   Administration TLV set.

   For SS-PW, when the Mapping message arrives at the remote PE, the
   receiving PE SHOULD try to take the PW out of service.  If the
   receiving PE locks the PW successfully, it SHOULD send a Notification
   message with PW status "Pseudowire in Lock Mode".  Otherwise, it
   SHOULD send a Notification message with the LDP Status code set to
   "PW Lock Failure".

   For MS-PW, when the Mapping message arrives at a downstream S-PE, the
   receiving S-PE SHOULD forward this Mapping message with the K bit
   unchanged towards the remote T-PE.  When the Mapping message arrives
   at the remote T-PE, it SHOULD try to take the PW out of service.  If
   the receiving T-PE locks the PW successfully, it SHOULD send a
   Notification message with PW status "Pseudowire in Lock Mode" to the
   upstream S-PE.  Otherwise, it SHOULD send a Notification message with
   the LDP Status code set to "PW Lock Failure".  On receipt of the
   Notification message, the S-PEs would know whether the MS-PW is in
   lock mode or not, and the S-PEs SHOULD forward the Notification
   message back to the Source T-PE.

   When the PE/T-PE wants to take the PW out of the lock mode, it MUST
   send a Mapping message with the Lock (K) bit in the MPLS-TP PW OAM
   Administration TLV cleared.  The receiving PE/T-PE SHOULD try to
   unlock the PW.  If the PW is unlocked successfully, the receiving PE/
   T-PE SHOULD send a Notification message with PW status bit
   "Pseudowire in Lock Mode" cleared.  Otherwise, it SHOULD send a
   Notification message with the LDP Status code set to "PW Unlock
   Failure".

3.2.  Loopback

   When a PE/T-PE wants to put the remote PE/T-PE of a PW into loopback
   mode, it MUST send a Mapping message with both the Lock (K) bit and
   Loopback (B) bit in the MPLS-TP PW OAM Administration TLV set.  When
   a T-PE wants to put a particular S-PE of the PW into loopback mode,
   it MUST send a Mapping message with both the Lock (K) bit and
   Loopback (B) bit set, and an Explicit Route Hop TLV(ER-Hop TLV)
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-mspw-er] identifying the Target S-PE node MUST be
   carried in the Mapping message.  The L flag in the ER-Hop TLV SHOULD
   be cleared.  To ensure that the ER-Hop TLV identifies a single node
   as the Target S-PE, The PreLen field in the IPv4 prefix ER-Hop TLV
   SHOULD be set to 32, the PreLen field in the IPv6 prefix ER-Hop TLV
   SHOULD be set to 128, and the PreLen field in the L2 PW Address ER-
   Hop TLV SHOULD be set to 96.  Information of the S-PE node can be
   collected using the SP-PE TLVs [RFC6073].

Internet-Draft        LDP Extensions for PW LI&LB             April 2013


   When the Mapping message arrives at the remote PE/T-PE, the receiving
   PE SHOULD try to put the PW in loopback mode.  If the receiver node
   puts the PW into loopback mode successfully, it SHOULD send a
   Notification message with PW status "Pseudowire in Loopback Mode".
   Otherwise, it SHOULD send a Notification message with the LDP Status
   code set to "PW Enter Loopback Failure".

   When a Mapping message with an ER-Hop TLV arrives an S-PE, the S-PE
   SHOULD check the ER-Hop TLV to see if it is the target S-PE of the
   message.  If not, the S-PE SHOULD forward the message with the K and
   B bit unchanged to the next hop S-PE.  When the Mapping message
   arrives at the target S-PE, the S-PE SHOULD parse the MPLS-TP PW OAM
   Administration TLV and try to put the PW into loopback mode.  If the
   S-PE puts the PW into loopback mode successfully, it SHOULD send a
   Notification message with PW status set to "Pseudowire in Loopback
   Mode".  An SP-PE TLV identifying the S-PE in loopback mode SHOULD
   also be carried in the Notification message.  If the S-PE fails to
   put the PW into loopback mode, it SHOULD send a Notification message
   with the LDP Status code set to "PW Enter Loopback Failure".  An SP-
   PE TLV identifying this S-PE SHOULD also be carried in the
   Notification message.

   When the PE/T-PE wants to take the remote PE/T-PE out of the loopback
   mode, it MUST send a Mapping message with the Lock (K) bit set and
   Loopback (B) bit cleared.  When the T-PE wants to take a particular
   S-PE out of loopback mode, the message MUST also carry an ER-Hop TLV
   to identify the target S-PE.  If the PW is taken out of loopback mode
   successfully, the receiving PE/T-PE/S-PE SHOULD send a Notification
   message with PW status bit "Pseudowire in Loopback Mode" cleared.
   Otherwise, it SHOULD send a Notification message with the LDP Status
   code set to "PW Exit Loopback Failure".  For the S-PE case, An SP-PE
   TLV identifying this S-PE node SHOULD also be carried in the
   Notification message.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Two bits ("Lock" (K) and "Loopback" (B)) as defined in section 2.1
   need to be allocated in the MPLS-TP PW OAM Administration TLV.

   Two new PW Status bits as defined in section 2.2 need to be allocated
   in the "Pseudowire Status Codes" Registry.

   Four new LDP status codes need to be assigned by the IANA in the LDP
   "STATUS CODE NAME SPACE":

   Range/Value   E    Description
   TBA           0    PW Lock Failure
   TBA           0    PW Unlock Failure
