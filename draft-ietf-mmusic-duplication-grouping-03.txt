   Duplication Grouping Semantics in the Session Description Protocol
               draft-ietf-mmusic-duplication-grouping-03

Abstract

   Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions, but can
   occur due to congestion, or other unplanned network outages.  This is
   especially true for IP multicast networks, where packet loss patterns
   can vary greatly between receivers.  One technique that can be used
   to recover from packet loss without incurring unbounded delay for all
   the receivers is to duplicate the packets and send them in separate
   redundant streams.  This document defines the semantics for grouping
   redundant streams in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  The
   semantics defined in this document are to be used with the SDP
   Grouping Framework.  SSRC-level (Synchronization Source) grouping
   semantics are also defined in this document for RTP streams using
   SSRC multiplexing.

1.  Introduction

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] is widely used today
   for delivering IPTV traffic, and other real-time multimedia sessions.
   Many of these applications support very large numbers of receivers,
   and rely on intra-domain UDP/IP multicast for efficient distribution
   of traffic within the network.

   While this combination has proved successful, there does exist a
   weakness.  As [RFC2354] noted, packet loss is not avoidable, even in
   a carefully managed network.  This loss might be due to congestion,
   it might also be a result of an unplanned outage caused by a flapping
   link, link or interface failure, a software bug, or a maintenance
   person accidentally cutting the wrong fiber.  Since UDP/IP flows do
   not provide any means for detecting loss and retransmitting packets,
   it leaves up to the RTP layer and the applications to detect, and
   recover from, packet loss.

Internet-Draft    Duplication Grouping Semantics in SDP        July 2013


   One technique to recover from packet loss without incurring unbounded
   delay for all the receivers is to duplicate the packets and send them
   in separate redundant streams.  Variations on this idea have been
   implemented and deployed today [IC2011].
   [I-D.ietf-avtext-rtp-duplication] explains how duplication can be
   achieved for RTP streams without breaking the RTP and RTP Control
   Protocol (RTCP) functionality.  In this document, we describe the
   semantics needed in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566]
   to support this technique.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  Duplication Grouping

3.1.  "DUP" Grouping Semantics

   Each "a=group" line is used to indicate an association relationship
   between the redundant streams.  The streams included in one "a=group"
   line are called a Duplication Group.

   Using the SDP Grouping Framework in [RFC5888], this document defines
   "DUP" as the grouping semantics for redundant streams.

   The "a=group:DUP" semantics MUST be used to group the redundant
   streams except when the streams are specified in the same media
   description, i.e., in the same "m" line (See Section 3.2).  In an
   "a=group:DUP" line, the order of the listed redundant streams does
   not strictly indicate the order of transmission, although it is
   RECOMMENDED that the stream listed first is sent first, with the
   other stream(s) being the (time-delayed) duplicate(s).

3.2.  Duplication Grouping for SSRC-Multiplexed RTP Streams

   [RFC5576] defines an SDP media-level attribute, called 'ssrc-group',
   for grouping the RTP streams that are SSRC multiplexed and carried in
   the same RTP session.  The grouping is based on the SSRC identifiers.
   Since SSRC-multiplexed RTP streams are defined in the same "m" line,
   the 'group' attribute cannot be used.

   This section explains how duplication is used with SSRC-multiplexed
   streams using the 'ssrc-group' attribute [RFC5576].

Internet-Draft    Duplication Grouping Semantics in SDP        July 2013


   The semantics of "DUP" for the 'ssrc-group' attribute are the same as
   the one defined for the 'group' attribute except that the SSRC
   identifiers are used to designate the duplication grouping
   associations: a=ssrc-group:DUP *(SP ssrc-id) [RFC5576].  As above,
   while in an "a=ssrc-group:DUP" line, the order of the listed
   redundant streams does not necessarily indicate the order of
   transmission, it is RECOMMENDED that the stream listed first is sent
   first, with the other stream(s) being the (time-delayed)
   duplicate(s).

3.3.  SDP Offer/Answer Model Considerations

   When offering duplication grouping using SDP in an Offer/Answer model
   [RFC3264], the following considerations apply.

   A node that is receiving an offer from a sender may or may not
   understand line grouping.  It is also possible that the node
   understands line grouping but it does not understand the "DUP"
   semantics.  From the viewpoint of the sender of the offer, these
   cases are indistinguishable.

   When a node is offered a session with the "DUP" grouping semantics
   but it does not support line grouping or the duplication grouping
   semantics, as per [RFC5888], the node responds to the offer either
   (1) with an answer that ignores the grouping attribute or (2) with a
   refusal to the request (e.g., 488 Not Acceptable Here or 606 Not
   Acceptable in SIP).

   In the first case, the original sender of the offer must send a new
   offer without any duplication grouping.  In the second case, if the
   sender of the offer still wishes to establish the session, it should
   retry the request with an offer without the duplication grouping.
   This behavior is specified in [RFC5888].

4.  SDP Examples

4.1.  Separate Source Addresses

   In this example, the redundant streams use the same IP destination
   address (232.252.0.1) but they are sourced from different addresses
   (198.51.100.1 and 198.51.100.2).  Thus, the receiving host needs to
   join both source-specific multicast (SSM) sessions separately.

     c=IN IP4 233.252.0.1/127
     a=source-filter:incl IN IP4 233.252.0.1 198.51.100.1 198.51.100.2

     a=ssrc:1000 cname:ch1@example.com
     a=ssrc:1010 cname:ch1@example.com
     a=ssrc-group:DUP 1000 1010
     a=mid:Ch1


   Note that in actual use, SSRC values, which are random 32-bit
   numbers, can be much larger than the ones shown in this example.
   Also note that this SDP description does not use the 'duplication-
   delay' attribute (defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-delayed-duplication])
   since the sender does not apply any delay between the redundant
   streams upon transmission.  Alternatively, one MAY explicitly insert
   an "a=duplication-delay:0" line before the "a=mid:Ch1" line for
   informational purposes.

4.2.  Separate Destination Addresses

   In this example, the redundant streams have different IP destination
   addresses.  The example shows the same UDP port number and IP source
   address for each stream, but either or both could have been different
   for the two streams.

     v=0
     o=ali 1122334455 1122334466 IN IP4 dup.example.com
     s=DUP Grouping Semantics
     t=0 0
     a=group:DUP S1a S1b
     m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 100
     c=IN IP4 233.252.0.1/127
     a=source-filter:incl IN IP4 233.252.0.1 198.51.100.1
     a=rtpmap:100 MP2T/90000
     a=mid:S1a
     m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 101
     c=IN IP4 233.252.0.2/127
     a=source-filter:incl IN IP4 233.252.0.2 198.51.100.1
     a=rtpmap:101 MP2T/90000
     a=mid:S1b


   Optionally, one could be more explicit and insert an "a=duplication-
   delay:0" line before the first "m" line.

4.3.  Temporal Redundancy

   In this example, the redundant streams have the same IP source and
   destination addresses (i.e., they are transmitted in the same SSM
   session).  Due to the same source and destination addresses, the
   packets in both streams will be routed over the same path.  To
   provide resiliency against packet loss, the duplicate of an original
   packet is transmitted 50 ms later as indicated by the 'duplication-
   delay' attribute (defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-delayed-duplication]).

     v=0
     o=ali 1122334455 1122334466 IN IP4 dup.example.com
     s=Delayed Duplication
     t=0 0
     m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 100
     c=IN IP4 233.252.0.1/127
     a=source-filter:incl IN IP4 233.252.0.1 198.51.100.1
     a=rtpmap:100 MP2T/90000
     a=ssrc:1000 cname:ch1a@example.com
     a=ssrc:1010 cname:ch1a@example.com
     a=ssrc-group:DUP 1000 1010
     a=duplication-delay:50
     a=mid:Ch1


5.  Security Considerations

   There is a weak threat for the receiver that the duplication grouping
   can be modified to indicate relationships that do not exist.  Such
   attacks might result in failure of the duplication mechanisms, and/or
   mishandling of the media streams by the receivers.

   In order to avoid attacks of this sort, the SDP description needs to
   be integrity protected and provided with source authentication.  This
   can, for example, be achieved on an end-to-end basis using S/MIME
   [RFC5652] [RFC5751] when the SDP is used in a signaling packet using
   MIME types (application/sdp).  Alternatively, HTTPS [RFC2818] or the
   authentication method in the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
   [RFC2974] could be used as well.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following semantics with IANA in
   Semantics for the 'group' SDP Attribute under SDP Parameters:

   replace "XXXX" with the number of this document prior to publication
