         Multiplexing Negotiation Using ICE Candidate Extension
             draft-hutton-mmusic-bundled-ice-candidates-00

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for extending ICE candidates with
   an optional parameter which can be used to negotiate the usage of
   bundled media, which refers to the usage of a single 5-tuple for
   multiple RTP streams.  In a scenario where a party initiating the
   negotiation supports ICE [RFC5245] this mechanism provides the
   ability to provide an SDP offer which is both backwards compatible
   and able to fully specify the use of bundled media.  Therefore, this
   mechanism allows bundled and non-bundled media to be negotiated in a
   single offer/answer exchange when both parties support ICE and this
   extension.  The mechanism complements the procedures described in
   [draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation].

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a mechanism for extending ICE candidates with
   an optional parameter which can be used to negotiate the usage of
   bundled media, which refers to the usage of a single 5-tuple for
   multiple RTP streams.  In a scenario where a party initiating the
   negotiation supports ICE [RFC5245] this mechanism provides the
   ability to provide an SDP offer which is both backwards compatible
   and able to fully specify the use of bundled media.  Therefore, this
   mechanism allows bundled and non-bundled media to be negotiated in a
   single offer/answer exchange when both parties support ICE and this
   extension.

   The mechanism complements the procedures within
   [draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] with explicitly signalled
   ports (OPEN ISSUE: Possibly also IP Address for the bundle media in
   each candidate that may form part of a bundle).  If the MMUSIC
   working group agrees this could be considered as an enhancement for
   incorporation in to [draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation].

   A problem with the existing bundling proposals is that it does not
   appear possible to create a single initial offer that will allow
   bundle to be negotiated but maintain interworking with bundle unaware
   implementations and therefore it is necessary to perform an initial
   offer/answer exchange which does not fully describe or at least only
   implicitly describes what the offerer really wants to offer.  The
   existing bundle proposals also don't take account of the fact that

Internet-Draft         BUNDLE WITH ICE CANDIDATES             March 2013


   when both parties support ICE [RFC5245] the port in the m-line of the
   initial offer may not be used at all, for example due to a dual stack
   offer endpoint offering IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in parallel.

   Also the existing bundle proposals have not considered some of the
   more complex ICE scenarios involving multiple candidates.  For
   example when an SDP m-line contains multiple ICE host candidates
   during dual stack negotiation, the candidates cannot be considered
   equivalent with regard to bundling with candidates on in another
   m-line and therefore some way of indicating which candidates can be
   bundled seems to be desirable.  This could be achieved by including
   the complete bundle transport address (IP and Port) in the candidate
   or by providing some kind of bundle linkage within the ICE candidate
   lines.

   OPEN ISSUE: Some analysis is required to determine whether it is also
   necessary to specify the bundle IP Address in the ICE candidate in
   addition to the bundleport.  Explicitly stating the complete
   transport address for the bundle seems advantageous.  This might also
   be necessary if for example different relay IP addresses are
   specified for audio and video in the non-bundled case but a single
   bundled IP address is required.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   5-tuple: A collection of the following values: source address, source
   port, destination address, destination port and protocol.

   Bundled media: Two or more RTP streams using a single 5-tuple.  The
   RTCP streams associated with the RTP streams also use a single
   5-tuple, which might be the same, but can also be different, as the
   one used by the RTP streams.

3.  SDP Offerer Procedures

   This document defines an ICE candidate extension to the ICE candidate
   with an attribute named "bundleport" which specifies the port to be
   used to bundle media.

   When generating an SDP offer which is to include a bundle group and
   also ICE candidates the offerer follows the procedures as specified
   in [draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] and in addition also

Internet-Draft         BUNDLE WITH ICE CANDIDATES             March 2013


   includes in each ICE candidate which relates to a bundle the new
   bundleport extension which specifies the port to be used for the
   multiplex.

   By following the additional procedures specified in this document the
   following advantages are realised:

   o  In the case when the answerer supports ICE the initial offer can
      be both bundle and non-bundle compatible.

   o  Only one offer/answer cycle is needed to negotiate bundle or non-
      bundle cases.  A second offer/answer may be needed following the
      initial negotiation which is normal ICE procedures

   o  It works for the dual stack scenario in which the port eventually
      used may only initially be signalled in the candidate line..

   An example SDP Offer is shown below.  Note that the a=candidate:
   attributes are split over two lines.

4.  SDP Answerer Procedures

   When an SDP Answerer receives an SDP Offer which contains a "BUNDLE"
   group, and the SDP Answerer accepts the offered "BUNDLE" group, the
   SDP Answerer MUST generate an SDP Answer as specified in
   [draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] with the exception that
   rather than using the port associated with the first "m=" line in the
   "BUNDLE" group it MUST use the bundleport from the selected ICE
   candidates relating to the bundle.

   Actually the requirement to use the port associated with the first
   "m=" line in the "BUNDLE" group whilst waiting for a second offer
   with identical ports in the m lines does not work in some ICE
   scenarios.  For example when receiving an offer from a dual stack
   device the port on the "m=" line may refer to the transport for the
   wrong address family and may not even work if there is no
   connectivity

5.  Extension to ICE candidate attribute

   The ICE [RFC5245] a=candidate attribute is extended as follows:


    candidate-attribute = "candidate" ":" foundation SP component-id SP
    transport SP
    priority SP
    connection-address SP     ;from RFC 4566
    port                      ;port from RFC 4566
    SP cand-type
    [SP rel-addr]

    [SP rel-port]
    [SP bundleport]
    *(SP extension-att-name SP
    extension-att-value)

    bundleport = "bundleport" SP port



   Alternatively if the IP address and port is fully specified in the
   a=candidate attribute would be extended as follows:


    candidate-attribute = "candidate" ":" foundation SP component-id SP
    transport SP
    priority SP
    connection-address SP     ;from RFC 4566
    port                      ;port from RFC 4566
    SP cand-type
    [SP rel-addr]
    [SP rel-port]
    [SP bundle]
    *(SP extension-att-name SP
    extension-att-value)

   bundle = "bundle" SP connection-address SP port

7.  IANA considerations

   If this document moves forward, it requests a new extension attribute
   "bundleport", to be defined for the ICE candidate-attribute to be
   reserved.

8.  Security Considerations

   TBD
