INTERNET DRAFT          New IP address structure       February 24, 2013


1. Introduction

   This scheme is on top of IPv4, to route packet between IPv4 domain.
   within IPv4 , the same existing IPv4 logic.

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Address Structure

   The address is divided into different levels. There are 32 bits in
   level 0, and it represents host address. Network addresses are
   represented by levels 1 - 3 , scalable up to 15 levels. There are 8
   bits each in network address level.

   Level and bit representation are shown in the following:

     15             3     2     1     0          <-- Level
   +-----+        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   | --- | -----  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   +-----+        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
      8               8    8    8     32     8
     Bits           Bits  Bits Bits  Bits   flag
                                            Bits

   The least significant byte is reserved in IP address to mark the
   level,multicast etc. 4 low order bits are used to mark the level and
   3 high order bits are used in multicast. All other combinations
   are unused.

   The purpose of  flag bits in the IP address is to make routing
   decisions.Identify the type ( unicast / multicast etc) and exact
   position of packet in the network then route accordingly.

3. Network structure

   The network has a tree-like structure. There are 255 interconnected
   networks in top level  (Note: in this document "network" means a 32
   bit address space). IP address demand determines the top level, could
   be 1,4,10, or 15. Each top level network has 255 child networks.
   These 255 children are interconnected, and they are hierarchically
   inferior. Each child network has 255 more and so on.

   In this logic IPv4 is treated as subnetted host address(level 0).
   In other words, the size of a single network is equal to the size
   of IPv4 address space, to subnet, follow the rules and logic of IPV4.
   Two different methods are used to route packets.First Hierarchical
   routing, to find the network. Then longest match routing with
   level 0 (IPv4 logic) to find the host.

4. IP address

   IP address is divided in to two parts
   Network address (Levels n - 1) and subnetted host address (level 0).

   It is not permitted to subnet the network address. To subnet level 0
   follow the rules and logic of IPV4

   Both network and host address are represented in dotted decimal
   format, use a colon to separate network and subnetted host address.


4.1. Network address

   Network address is in hierarchical order.

   Write down the tree , from the tree route to the desired network and
   fill out zeros in the child tree.

   Examples:
   25.0.0 // a Level 3 network address.
   25.2.0 // a Level 2 network address
   25.2.16 // a level 1 network address

   Left most block is the tree root , next block is the child and so on.

4.2. Host address

   Each network has fixed number of hosts (32 bits).

   Represent host address in IPv4 format. Combine network address and
   host address to get the global address. Separate the network with
   a colon. Subnet mask is applicable only to the host address(Level 0).

   25.0.0:117.213.56.250/xx
   25.2.0:117.213.56.250/xx
   25.2.16:117.213.56.250/xx

5. IP address configuration

5.1. On Router

   Configure the level and network address on every router.
   Level and network address defines the position of router in the tree.

   Example 1

   L3 // Level
   25.0.0 // Network address

   Example 2

   L2
   25.2.0

   Example 3

   L1
   25.2.16

   On interfaces configure level 0 address (Same as IPV4).

   Example:
   117.213.56.250/xx

   To get the global address, prepend network address to the host
   address(network address+host address)

   25.0.0:117.213.56.250
   25.4.0:117.213.56.250
   25.4.16:117.213.56.250

5.2. On Host

   Need to configure only the level 0 address in ipv4 format.

   Example:
   117.213.56.250/xx

   Then request the network address from the router. Combine those
   together for global address.

6. Routing

   Advertise required information in BGP to route packet to other
   networks.The address of edge interfaces and the details of neighbor
   network connected to that interface.


   Edge interfaces defines the boundary of a network, therefore 32 bits
   mask is preferred on those interfaces.

   BGP Routes are classified in to 4

   1.Upstream routes  // information to route packet to parent network.
   2.Subnetted Host routes // same as IPV4
   3.Downstream routes //information to route packet to
   255 child network.
   4.Same-level routes // information to route packet to same-level
    (brother/sister) network.

   Recursively final routing is based on IPv4.

   Exchange same-level (brother/sister) routes between same-level
   (brother/sister) networks using BGP.Only same-level routes. 

   Between interconnected root network or between interconnected child
   network of the same parent, if they are not fully meshed. No need to
   exchange any other information between networks.

   Examples:
   New BGP Routing Entries of a Level 2 router.

   L3 via 117.213.56.250   //upstream network L3 (level 3) is reachable
                           via 94.66.82.11

   L1 46 via 117.213.56.250   //child network L1 46 is reachable
                              via 117.213.56.250

   L2 25 via 117.213.56.250   //Same-level Network L2 25 is reachable
                              via 117.213.56.250



   No change in IGP ( same as IPv4).

6.1. Functions of a Host

   1.Request Globally unique destination address from the DNS.
   2.Set the Level of Destination.

     compare source and destination network address
      |
      +- If they are same --> Set destination level to 0.
      |
      +- Else
          |
          +-Trim off/discard the unwanted top level network information,
            if any, and set the level of destination. The destination
            level should not be less than the level of the source
            network.

   Example:

   Source Address         25.3.0:117.213.56.250

   Destination address    25.2.0:117.213.56.250


   In this example, it is unnecessary to traverse level 3; therefore we
   can discard level 3 information.

   Set the level to 2 in the destination address and send it to
   the destination.

6.2. Unicast Routing Logic

   Hierarchically match level by level to find the network, then longest
   match using IPv4.


   Compare the destination IP address level with router level
     |
     +--If IP Level = 0 the Forward the packet to the longest matching
     |   host address ( level 0 address)
     |
     +--If Greater than router level
     |   |
     |   +-Search for the upstream route
     |      |
     |      +-If present, then forward packet towards exit
     |      +-Else, Default routing
     |
     |

     |
     |

          |

            |
            +-If different
            |  |
            |  +-Search for matching same-level route
            |    |
            |    +-If present , then forward packet towards exit.
            |    |
            |    +-Else, Default routing.
            |
            +-Else check child network**
              |
              |
              +-If present (>0)
              |  |
              |  +-Search for matching Downstream route
              |    |
              |    +-If present  , then forward packet towards exit.
              |    |  The boundary router must decrement the Level.
              |    |
              |    +-Else, Default routing
              |
              +-Else(=0), Set the destination level to 0 and Forward the
                packet to the longest matching host address
                ( level 0 address).


   Default routing is for IGP.IGP directs to BGP and BGP redirects to
   other network.

   *Compare only the matching level address. Not the complete address
   Example:
   Router level 2
   Routers network address 25.88.0
   Destination network address 25.66.0

   compare level 2 address. i.e. 88 and 66

   Different :-
   search for the same level network L2 66

   **Example: Router level - 2 ,therefore check level 1 address.

7.  Multicast

   Every unicast address is multicast enabled. To change a unicast
   address to a multicast address set flag bits to 11100000.

   Request multicast feed: Set the flag bits to 10100000 and send a
   multicast request towards the source. For the first request for that
   unique source, the router has to forward the request towards the
   source. For all subsequent requests, router has to maintain a request
   table. Repeat the process in each router along the path.

   Request table
   O----------------------+-----------------+------------------------O
   |** Multicast address  |# Requested      |* layer 2 source address|
   |                      |  interface      | of the request packet  |
   +----------------------+-----------------+------------------------+
   |25.0.0:117.213.56.250 | FastEthernet 0  |    xx-xx-xx-xx         |
   +----------------------+-----------------+------------------------+
   |                      |                 |                        |
   +----------------------+-----------------+------------------------+
   |                      |                 |                        |
   |                      |                 |                        |

   ** Multicast address: Globally unique multicast address .
   Example: 25.0.0:117.213.56.250

   #Requested interface: Request accepted interface.

   *For multipoint interface, to keep track of all individual request.

   Multicast feed: Set the flag bits to 11100000 (224) for multicast
   feed.Routers should replicate the feed to all requested interfaces.

   Cancel Multicast request: Set the flag bits to 11000000 and send a
   multicast cancellation request towards the source. For the last
   request for that unique source, the router has to forward the
   cancellation request towards the source. Repeat the process in each
   router along the path. For all other cancellation requests, remove
   the request from the request table.



   It is possible to multicast using IPv4 address .Set the flag bits
   to 0 for  level 0 multicast / broadcast, to read only level 0 address
   and to avoid a search in multicast table.

8. Network scaling

   To scale a network

   1. Build new root ( 255 interconnected network) - level n+1  .
   2. Remove all existing root level (top level).
      interconnections (level n).
   3. Connect level n networks under level n+1.

   Now, it is possible to add 254 new children under each new parent.
   Each new child has 255 more and so on.

   Example:
   Connect network 1.0.0 under level 4 network 1.
       New address 1.1.0.0

       it is possible to add 254 new networks under network 1.0.0.0
       1.2.0.0. to 1.255.0.0

   Connect network 2.0.0 under level 4 network 2.
       New address 2.2.0.0

       254 new networks under network 2.0.0.0
       2.1.0.0. , 2.3.0.0 to 2.255.0.0

   Connect network 3.0.0 under level 4 network 3.
       New address 3.3.0.0

       254 new networks 3.1.0.0,3.2.0.0, 3.4.0.0 - 3.255.0.0

   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
   Connect network 255.0.0 under level 4 network 255.
       New address 255.255.0.0
