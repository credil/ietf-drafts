      <t>Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
      the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
      accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects      
      in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of
      Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB module that is
      compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in 
      <xref target="RFC2578"/>,  
      <xref target="RFC2579"/> and  
      <xref target="RFC2580"/>.</t>

    <section title="Conventions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",          
         "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and OPTIONAL" 
         in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>


    <section title="Overview">
      <t><xref target="RFC6130"/> allows a router in a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) to discover and track topological information of routers up to two hops away by virtue of exchanging HELLO messages. This information is useful for routers running various routing and multicast flooding protocols developed within the IETF MANET Working Group.</t>


      <section title="Terms">
        <t>The following definitions apply throughout this document:</t>
        <t><list style='symbols'>
          <t>Notification Objects - triggers and associated notification             messages allowing for asynchronous tracking of pre-defined            events on the managed router.</t>
          <t>Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are initialized to default settings or set through the management interface defined by this MIB.</t>
          <t>State Objects - automatically generated values which            define the current operating state of the NHDP protocol process in the router.</t>
          <t>Performance Objects - automatically generated values             which help an administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the NHDP protocol process on the router and the overall discovery performance within the MANET.</t>
        </list></t>
      </section>    

    </section>



    <section title="Structure of the MIB Module">
      <t>This section presents the structure of the NHDP-MIB module. 
         The MIB is arranged into the following structure:</t>
      <t><list style='symbols'>
        <t>nhdpNotifications - objects defining NHDP-MIB notifications.</t>
        <t>nhdpObjects - defining objects within this MIB.
           The objects are arranged into the following groups:
           <list style='symbols'>
              <t>Configuration Group - defining objects related to 
                 the configuration of the NHDP instance on the router.</t>
              <t>State Group - defining objects which reflect the current
                 state of the NHDP instance running on the router.</t>
              <t>Performance Group - defining objects which are 
                 useful to a management station when characterizing the
                 performance of NHDP on the router and in the MANET.</t>
           </list></t>
        <t>nhdpConformance - defining the minimal and maximal conformance
           requirements for implementations of this MIB.</t>
      </list></t>


	   <section title="Notifications">
      	<t>This section describes the use of notifications, and mechanisms to enhance the ability to manage NHDP networks.</t>
      	
         <section title="Introduction">
         	<t>Notifications can be emitted by an NHDP router as a reaction to a specific event. This allows a network manager to efficiently determine the source of problems or significant changes of configuration or topology, instead of polling a possibly large number of NHDP routers.</t>
         </section>
         
         <section title="Notification Generation">
         	<t>When an exception event occurs, the application notifies the local agent, which sends a notification to the appropriate SNMP management stations.  The message includes the notification type and may include a list of notification-specific variables.  <xref target="MIB"/> contains the notification definitions, which includes the variable lists. At least one IP address of the NHDP router that originates the notification is included in the variable list so that the network manager may determine the source of the notification.</t>
         </section>
         
         <section title="Limiting Frequency of Notifications">
         	<t>To limit the frequency of notifications, the following additional   mechanisms are suggested, similar to those in <xref target="RFC4750"/>:</t>
             <section title="Ignoring Initial Activity">
             	<t>The majority of critical events occur when NHDP is enabled on a router, at which time the symmetric neighbors and two-hop neighbors of the NHDP router are discovered. During this initial period, a potential flood of notifications is unnecessary since the events are expected. To avoid unnecessary notifications, a router should not originate expected notifications until a certain time interval has elapsed, which is to be predefined by the network manager.</t>
             </section>
         
             <section title="Throttling Traps">
             	<t>The mechanism for throttling the notifications is the same as in <xref target="RFC4750"/> (i.e. the amount of transmitted notifications per time is bounded).</t>

  		<t>Appropriate values for the window time and upper bound are to be selected by the network manager and depend on the deployment of the MANET.</t>
             </section>
         
             <section title="One Notification per Event">
             	<t>Similar to the according mechanism in <xref target="RFC4750"/>, only one notification is sent per event.</t>
             </section>
         </section>
      </section>



      <section title="The Configuration Group">
        <t>The NHDP router is configured with a set of controls. The authoritative list of configuration controls within the NHDP-MIB are found within the MIB module itself. Generally, an attempt was made in developing the NHDP-MIB module to support all configuration objects defined in <xref target="RFC6130"/>. For all of the configuration parameters, the same constraints and default values of these parameters as defined in <xref target="RFC6130"/> are followed.  Refer to <xref target="RFC5148"/> for guidance on setting jitter related parameters, e.g., nhdpMaxJitter.</t>
      </section>



      <section title="The State Group">
        <t>The State Group reports current state information of a router running <xref target="RFC6130"/>. The NHDP-MIB State Group tables were designed to contain the complete set of state information defined within the information bases specified in Section 6, Section 7 and Section 8 of <xref target="RFC6130"/>.</t>

        <t>Two constructs, i.e., TEXTUAL CONVENTIONs, are defined to support 
           of the tables in the State Group. 
           The NHDP protocol stores and indexes information through sets
           of (dynamically defined) addresses, i.e., address sets.  
           Within SMIv2 it is not possible to
           index tables with variably defined address sets.  Hence, these TEXTUAL
           CONVENTIONS are defined to provide a local mapping between NHDP
           managed address sets and SMIv2 table indexing.
           These constructs are the NeighborIfIndex and NeighborRouterIndex.  
           These are locally (to the NHDP router) defined, unique identifiers
           of virtual neighbors and neighbor interfaces. 

           Due to the nature of the
           NHDP protocol, the local router may have identified distinct address
           sets but is not able to associate these as a single interface.  Hence,
           two or more NeighborIfIndexes pointing to multiple distinct address sets
           may in fact be related to a common neighbor interface.  This ambiguity
           may also hold with respect to the assignment of the NeighborRouterIndex.
           The local MIB agent is responsible for managing, aggregating and
           retiring the defined indexes, and in updating MIB tables using these
           indexes as the local router learns more about its neighbors'
           topology.
 
           These constructs are used to define indexes to the appropriate State Group tables and 
           to correlate table entries to address sets, virtual neighbor interfaces and 
           virtual neighbors
           within the MANET.</t>

      <section anchor="perf_group" title="The Performance Group">
        <t>The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.
           This section lists objects for NHDP performance monitoring,
           some of which are explicitly defined in the NHDP-MIB and others which
           can be estimated through a combination of base objects from this MIB.
           Throughout this section, those objects will be pointed out that are 
           intended as base objects which are explicitly defined within this MIB 
           and those objects which can be estimated.</t>
        
        <t>Unstable neighbors or 2-hop neighbors and frequent changes 
           of sets can have a negative influence on the performance of NHDP. 
           The following objects allow management applications to acquire 
           information related to the stability and performance of NHDP:</t>
        
        <t>The following objects return statistics related to HELLO messages:
                 <list style='symbols'>
                    <t>Total number of sent HELLO messages on an interface
                       <list style='hanging'>

                          <t>This is a Base Object.</t>
                          <t>Object name: nhdpIfHelloMessageRecvd</t>

                       <list style='hanging'>
                          <t>This is a Base Object.</t>
                          <t>Object name: nhdpIfHelloMessagePeriodicXmits</t>

                          <t>Object type: Counter32</t>
                       </list></t>

                    <t>Acquire history of HELLO message scheduling instances for a given time duration on an interface
                       <list style='hanging'>
                          <t>It is desirable to develop the history of the exact timestamps of each HELLO message that has been sent as well as the type of the message (triggered or periodical). The list of events starts at the given point of time t0 and ends at the given time t1.</t>
                          <t>This is a Derived Object estimated from the NHDP-MIB. 
                             It is derived from, e.g., the nhdpIfHelloMessagePeriodicXmits Base 
                             Object from the NHDP-MIB.</t>
                       </list></t>

                    <t>Histogram of the intervals between HELLO messages on an interface
                       <list style='hanging'>
                          <t>It is desirable to track the values (in a 2-dimensional array) that represent a histogram                              of intervals between HELLO messages. The histogram would display the distribution of intervals between two consecutive HELLOs using a given bin size. It includes all HELLOs that have been sent after the given time t0 and before the given time t1.</t>
                          <t>This is a Derived Object to be estimated from objects within the NHDP-MIB. 
                             It can be estimated from, e.g., the nhdpIfHelloMessagePeriodicXmits 
                             Base Object from the NHDP-MIB. The network management 
                             application could convert this information into the desired histogram.</t>
                       </list></t>

                    <t>Changes of the frequency of the message scheduling on an interface
                       <list style='hanging'>
                          <t>This object will divide the given time interval from t0 to t1 into a given number of equal parts. It then creates a  histogram for each part and calculates the distances (e.g. using the Bhattacharyya distance) between each two adjacent histograms in time. A higher value between two histograms means more difference between the histograms. For instance, this is representative of an event that suddenly sends many triggered HELLO messages, whereas before there have been only very few such triggered messages.</t>
                          <t>This is a Derived Object estimated from objects within the NHDP-MIB, 
                             as previously discussed, 
                             albeit this is a bit more complex with respect to the management application.</t>

         <t>This section specifies the
            relationship of the MIB modules contained in this document to
            other standards, particularly to standards containing other MIB
            modules.  Definitions imported from other MIB modules and other MIB
            modules that SHOULD be implemented in conjunction with the MIB
            module contained within this document are identified in this section.</t>


          <section title="Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB">
            <t>The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB <xref target="RFC3418"/> is defined as being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a whole. The 'system' group provides identification of the management entity and certain other system-wide data. The NHDP-MIB does not duplicate those objects.</t>
          </section>


          <section title="Relationship to Routing Protocol MIBs Relying on the NHDP-MIB">
            <t><xref target="RFC6130"/> allows routing protocols to rely on the neighborhood information that is discovered by means of HELLO message exchange. In order to allow for troubleshooting, fault isolation, and management of such routing protocols through a routing protocol MIB, it may be desired to align the State Group tables of the NHDP-MIB and the routing protocol MIB. This is accomplished through the definition of two TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS in the NHDP-MIB: the NeighborIfIndex and the NeighborRouterIndex.  These object types are used to develop indexes into common NHDP-MIB and routing protocol State Group tables. These objects are locally significant but should be locally common to the NHDP-MIB and the routing protocol MIB implemented on a common networked router. This will allow for improved cross referencing of information across the two MIBs.</t>

    DESCRIPTION
        "An arbitrary, locally unique identifier associated with a
        virtual interface of a discovered NHDP neighbor.
        Due to the nature of the NHDP protocol, the local router 
        may not know if two distinct addresses belong to the 
        same interface of a neighbor or to two different 
        interfaces.  As the local router gains more
        knowledge of its neighbors, its local view may change and 
        this table will be updated to reflect the local router's current
        understanding associating address sets to neighbor interfaces.
        The local router identifies virtual neighbor interface through 
        the receipt of address lists advertised through an 
        NHDP HELLO message.  
        
        All objects of type NeighborIfIndex are assigned by the agent
        out of a common number space.

        The value for each discovered virtual neighbor 
        interface must remain constant at least from 
        one re-initialization of the entity's network management 
        agent to the next re-initialization, except that 
        if an application is deleted and re-created.  If the
        local router gains information associating two virtual
        interfaces on a neighbor as a common interface, 
        then the agent must aggregate the two address sets to 
        a single index chosen from the set of aggregated indexes, 
        it must update all tables in this 
        MIB which are indexed by indexes
        of type NeighborIfIndex.  It can then reuse freed 
        index values following the next agent restart.

        The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP
        entity."

NeighborRouterIndex ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d"
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "An arbitrary, locally unique identifier associated with a
        virtual discovered neighbor (one or two hop).  Due to the 
        nature of the NHDP protocol, the local router may identify 
        multiple virtual neighbors  which in fact are one and 
        the same.  Two hop neighbors with more than one advertised 
        address will exhibit this behavior.  As the
        local router's knowledge of its neighbors' topology
        increases, the local router will be able to associate
        multiple virtual neighbor indexes into a single virtual
        neighbor index chosen from the set of aggregated indexes,
        it must update all tables in this MIB indexed by these
        indexes, and it can reuse the freed indexes following the
        next agent re-initialization.

        All objects of type NeighborRouterIndex are assigned by
        the agent out of a common number space.

        The NeighborRouterIndex defines a discovered NHDP peer
        virtual neighbor of the local router.
        The value for each discovered virtual neighbor index must remain
        constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's
        network management agent to the next re-initialization, except
        that if an application is deleted and re-created.

        The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP
        entity. An NeighborRouterIndex value must not be re-used 
        until the next agent restart."

   -- This was necessary because the NHDP protocol manages and
   -- indexes based upon dynamic address tuples, i.e.,

   -- defined indexes for accessing its table rows.
   -- The NeighborIfIndex defines a unique (to the local router)

   -- unique (to the local router) index referencing a discovered
   -- virtual neighbor within the MANET.  
   --
   -- Due to the nature of the NHDP protocol,
   -- different indexes may be related to common neighbor

   -- obtained through NHDP has not allowed the local router
   -- to relate these virtual objects (i.e., interfaces or routers)
   -- at this point in time.  As more topology information
   -- is gathered by the local router, it may associate
   -- virtual interfaces or routers and collapse these

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This MIB defines objects for the configuration, monitoring and
         notification of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol <xref target="RFC6130"/>. 
         NHDP allows routers to acquire topological information up to two hops away 
         by virtue of exchanging HELLO messages. The information acquired by NHDP 
         may be used by routing protocols. The neighborhood information, exchanged 
         between routers using NHDP, serves these routing protocols as a baseline 
         for calculating paths to all destinations in the MANET, relay set selection 
         for network-wide transmissions etc.</t>

      <t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
         with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such objects
         may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
         The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
         proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
         These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>nhdpIfStatus - this writable object turns on or off the NHDP
             process for the specified interface.  If disabled, higher level
             protocol functions, e.g., routing, would fail causing
             network-wide disruptions.</t>

          <t>nhdpHelloInterval, nhdpHelloMinInterval, and nhdpRefreshInterval
             - these writable objects control the rate at which HELLO messages 
             are sent on a wireless interface.  If set at too high a rate, 
             this could represent a form of DOS attack by overloading interface 
             resources.</t>

          <t>nhdpHystAcceptQuality, nhdpHystRejectQuality, nhdpInitialQuality,
             nhdpInitialPending - these writable objects affect the perceived 
             quality of the NHDP links and hence the overall stability of the network.  
             If improperly set, these settings could result in network-wide disruptions.</t>

          <t>nhdpInterfaceTable - this table contains writable objects that affect 
             the overall performance and stability of the NHDP process.  
             Failure of the NHDP process would result in network-wide failure.  
             Particularly sensitive objects from this table are discussed 
             in the previous list items. This is the only table in the 
             NHDP-MIB with writable objects.</t>
        </list></t>


      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
         MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
         vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
         even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
         encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
         via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
         sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         <list style="symbols">
          <t>nhdpDiscIfSetTable - The contains information on discovered neighbors,
             specifically their IP address in the nhdpDiscIfSetIpAddr object. 
             This information provides an adversary broad information on the 
             members of the MANET, located within this single table.  
             This information can be use to expedite attacks on the other members 
             of the MANET without having to go through a laborious discovery 
             process on their own. This object is the index into the table, 
             and has a MAX-ACCESS of 'not-accessible'.  However, this information 
             can be exposed using SNMP operations.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>MANET technology is often deployed to support communications of 
         emergency services or military tactical applications.  In these 
         applications, it is imperative to maintain the proper operation of the
         communications network and to protect sensitive information related 
         to its operation.  Therefore, when implementing these capabilities, 
         the full use of SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms for authentication 
         and privacy is RECOMMENDED.</t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
         if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
         there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed 
         to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.</t>

      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
         provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>,
         section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
         mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
         RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
         cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to 
         ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
         module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
         those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
         SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>
