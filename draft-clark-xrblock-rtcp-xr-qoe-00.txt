RTCP XR QoE Metrics                                        November 2011


1. Introduction 

1.1. QoE Metrics Report Block

   This draft defines a new block types to augment those defined
   in RFC3611 for use in reporting QoE metrics.  QoE metrics consider
   the impact of a range of transmission and payload (content) 
   related impairments on the quality of a service from the user
   viewpoint.

1.2. RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in RFC3550 [2]. 
   RFC3611 [3] defined an extensible structure for reporting using
   an RTCP Extended Report (XR).  This draft defines
   a new Extended Report block that MUST be used as defined in
   RFC3550 and RFC3611.

1.3 Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [9] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  Metrics
   described in this draft either reference external definitions
   or define metrics generally in accordance with the guidelines
   in [9].

1.4 Applicability
 
   This memo applies to any application of RTP for which QoE
   measurement algorithms are defined.

2. Definitions

2.1 QoE Metrics

   A QoE ("Quality of Experience") metric is intended to provide a
   measure that is indicative of the user's view of a service. 
   This is commonly expressed as a MOS ("Mean Opinion Score") which
   usually (but not always) is a 1.0-5.0 numerical scale in which
   a 1.0 represents "Unacceptable" and 5.0 represents "Excellent".

   True MOS scores are obtained using subjective testing, and tend
   vary from test to test.  Subjective testing is also not
   suitable for measuring the quality of operational services and
   hence it is common practice to use objective algorithms to 
   estimate subjective quality.  During the development of such QoE
   algorithms, there is extensive comparison against both subjective
   test data and data from other "trusted" objective test tools.

RTCP XR QoE Metrics                                        November 2011

   ITU-T Recommendation P.564 defines a methodology for verifying
   the performance of QoE estimation algorithms for Voice over IP
   services.  There is standardization work underway related to


   QoE metrics for video and audio.  The continuous progression of
   work in this area means that new algorithms may be defined in
   the future, hence this memo does make provision for new
   algorithms.  Implementors are advised that IPR disclosures
   have been made in respect of most known QoE estimation algorithms
   and they should check the IPR disclosure databases and policies of
   the relevant standards organizations (for example ITU and ETSI).

   ITU-T Recommendation P.800.1 describes terminology that should be
   use for MOS scores used to describe Speech quality.  This uses the
   abbreviations LQ and CQ for Listening and Conversational Quality
   respectively, and extends these using O for Objective, E for
   Estimated and S for Subjective.  Hence an objectively measured
   listening quality MOS score would be denoted MOS-LQO.
   
   MOS scores typically use a common scale of 1 to 5 and are scaled
   for comparison with subjectively measured MOS.  MOS scores for
   narrowband speech and wideband speech, or for low resolution
   video and high resolution video are typically placed into the
   same range.  This occurs because a subjective test is usually
   a comparitive test amongst similar codecs or devices. Hence a
   high quality AMR-WB or G.722 wideband voice call may have a lower
   MOS score than a narrowband G.729 call, even though the quality is
   higher.  Similary, a video subjective test typically uses devices
   with similar resolution and hence a high definition system may 
   have the same MOS score as a standard definition system.
   
   ITU-T P.800.1 addressed this issue of MOS scaling through the use
   of an additional N or W qualifier to denote Narrowband or Wideband.
   So a MOS-LQON score is an objectively measured listening quality
   MOS for narrowband (8kHz sample rate) conditions.  Some codecs
   are able to switch dynamically between narrowband and wideband, 
   which is addressed by the the "M" or mixed qualifier.
   
   The issue for audio video MOS is very similar to that of speech.
   This is addressed by recent work in ITU-T [11] which introduced
   the idea of Absolute and Relative MOS.  Absolute MOS "does" 
   include the effects of image resolution whereas Relative MOS does
   "not".  This draft presumes that ITU-T will adopt similar 
   terminology to P.800.1 for video MOS. [Editors note, will need 
   updating as ITU update relevant standards]
   
   Two cases of MOS-CQ have been treated separately in this draft.
   The first of these is MOS-CQEN, which is an Estimated (not
   measured) MOS based on ITU-T G.107. The MOS value is calculated
   by first calculating an R (or RCQ) value and then converting 
   
Clark & Kastner                                                [Page  3]

RTCP XR QoE Metrics                                        November 2011

   this to a MOS.  This conversion leads to a MOS score that is
   typically higher than current subjective test data (4.45 vs
   4.2), which can lead to difficulty interpreting the values.
   The second case is MOS-CQEN-TTC which is related to a Japanese
   national standard - TTC JJ201.01.  JJ201.01 is based on G.107
   however Japanese MOS scores are typically much lower than those
   in other countries and a MOS score for G.711 would be 3.8 in
   Japan versus 4.2 for a typical subjective test and 4.45 for 
   G.107.  
   
   It is extremely important that the correct MOS is referenced.
   For example a MOS of 3.6 would represent a small degree of 
   degration (0.2) using the Japanese JJ201.01 scaling but a very
   large degradation ( 0.85) using G.107 scaling.

2.2 Channel

   Certain types of encoder (for example stereo audio codecs) 
   incorporate multiple audio or video channels into a single encoded
   stream which is then packetized and carried in RTP or MPEG
   Transport. Within the scope of this memo, the term "channel" 
   applies to this definition only - if multiple audio or video
   streams are carried either in separate RTP sessions (identified
   by an SSRC) or MPEG Transport program streams (identified by a
   PID) then the Measurement Identifier block MUST be used to 
   identify the stream to which metrics apply.

3.2 Definition of Fields in QoE Metric Report Block

   block type (BT): 8 bits

      A QoE Report Block is identified by the constant
      QOEX.
   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace QOEX with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

   Measurement Type Indication (I): 2 bits

      This field is used to indicate whether the QoE Metrics are
      Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics, that is, whether the
      reported values applies to the most recent measurement interval


      duration between successive metrics reports (I=10) (the Interval
      Duration), to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=11) (the Cumulative Duration) or is
      a sampled instantaneous value (I=01).
      
      Numerical values for interval or duration are provided in the
      Measurement Identifier block referenced by the tag field below.

   Measurement Identifier association (tag): 6 bits

      This field is used to identify the Measurement Identifier block
      which describes this measurement.  The relevant Measurement
      Identifier block has the same tag value as the QoE block
      Note that there may be more than one Measurement Identifier block
      per RTCP packet.

   Block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words minus one.

4. SDP Signaling

   RFC3611 [3] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol) 
   [4] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.
 
   This section augments the SDP [4] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined in 
   RFC3611[3] by providing a "xr-format" to signal the use of the report
   block defined in this document. 

     rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)]
           CRLF (defined in RFC3611)

     xr-format = xr-format / 
                qoe-metrics

     qoe-metrics   = "qoe-metrics" [EQUAL word]
     DIGIT          = %x30-39
     format-ext     = non-ws-string
     non-ws-string  = 1*(%x21-FF)
     CRLF           = %d13.10


5. IANA Considerations  

   This document creates a new block type within the IANA "RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry" called the QoE Metrics, and a new [new-xrblock] 
   parameter within the "RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry".

6. Security Considerations 

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide
   information about the nature and duration of a session established
   between two or more endpoints.
