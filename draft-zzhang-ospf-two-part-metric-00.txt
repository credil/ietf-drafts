                draft-zzhang-ospf-two-part-metric-00.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies an optional extension to the OSPF protocol,
   to represent the metric on a multi-access network as two parts: the
   metric from a router to the network, and the metric from the network
   to the router.  The router to router metric would be the sum of the
   two.

1.  Introduction

   For a broadcast network, a Network LSA is advertised to list all
   routers on the network, and each router on the network includes a
   link in its Router LSA to describe its connection to the network.
   The link in the Router LSA includes a metric but the listed routers
   in the Network LSA does not include a metric.  This is based on the
   assumption that from a particular router, all others on the same
   network can be reached with the same metric.

   With some broadcast networks, different routers can be reached with
   different metrics.  RFC 6845 extends the OSPF protocol with a hybrid
   interface type for that kind of broadcast networks, with which no
   Network LSA is used and routers simply includes p2p links to all
   routers on the same network with individual metrics.  Broadcast
   capability is still utilized to optimize database synchronization and
   adjacency maintenance.

   That works well for broadcast networks on which metric between
   different pair of routers are really independent.  For example, VPLS
   networks.

   With certain types of broadcast networks, further optimization can be
   made to reduce the size of the Router LSAs and number of updates.

   Consider a satellite radio network, with the satellite being the
   central controller and some ground terminals being mobile.  All
   communication go through the satellite.  When the mobile terminals
   move about, their communication capability may change.  When OSPF
   runs over the radio network (routers being or in tandem with the
   terminals), RFC 6845 hybrid interface can be used, but with the
   following drawbacks.

   Consider that one terminal/router moves into an area where
   communication capability degrades significantly.  Through the radio
   control protocol all others determine that the metric to this
   particular one changed and they all need to update their Router LSAs
   accordingly.  This router also determines that its metric to reach
   all others also changed and it also need to update its Router LSA.
   Consider that there could be many terminals and many of them can be
   moving fast and frequently, the number/frequency of updates of those
   large Router LSAs could become inhibiting.

2.  Proposed Enhancement

   Notice that in the above scenario, when one terminal's communication
   capability changes, its metric to all others and the metric from all
   others to it will all change in a similar fashion.  Given this, the

Internet-Draft            ospf-two-part-metric              October 2013


   above problem can be easily addressed by breaking the metric into two
   parts: the metric to the controller and the metric from the
   controller.  The metric from terminal R1 to R2 would be the sum of
   the metric from R1 to the controller and the metric from the
   controller to R2.

   Now instead of using the RFC6845 hybrid interface type, the network
   is just treated as a regular broadcast one.  A router on the network
   no longer needs to list individual metrics to each neighbors in its
   Router LSA.  The transit link's metric in the Router LSA either
   represents the router's symmetric metric to/from the network, or in
   case of asymetric metric, for OSPFv3 an additional TLV can be added
   to represent the metric from the network to the router, following
   draft-acee-ospfv3-lsa-extend (details TBD), and for OSPFv2, an MT
   metric field can be used.

   With this, the size of Router LSA will be significantly reduced.
   When a router's communication capability changes, only itself need to
   update its Router LSA and nobody else does.

   Note that while the example uses the satellite as the relay point at
   radio level (layer 2), at layer 3 the satellite does not play any
   role.  It does not need to be running layer 3 protocol at all.
   Rather, the metric is abstracted as to/from the "network".

3.  Speficications

   The following protocol specifications are added to or modified from
   the base OSPF protocol.  If an area contains one or more two-part
   metric networks, then all routers in the area must support the
   extensions specified here.  This document does not currently specify
   a way to detect a router's capability of supporting this, and relies
   on operator's due diligence in provisioning.  A protocol mechanism
   may be developer in the future.

   The "Router interface parameters" has the following additions:

   o  Two-part metric: TRUE if the interface connects to a multi-access
      network that uses two-part metric.

   o  Interface input cost: Link state metric from the network to this
      router.  Defaulted to "Interface output cost".  May be configured
      or dynamically adjusted to a value different from the "Interface
      output cost", and in which case, it MUST be advertised in addition
      to the link (output) cost for this interface in the router's
      Router LSA, (see details below).

   To signal that a network is using Two-part Metric, a new Link Type X

Internet-Draft            ospf-two-part-metric              October 2013


   (value TBD) is added.  It is similar to Type 2, except that the
   network uses Two-part Metric, and there may be an optional network-
   to-router metric (interface input cost).


   Link type   Description       Link ID
   --------------------------------------------
       X       Link to transit   Interface of
               network that uses the Designated
               Two-part Metric   Router

   For the network-to-router metric (interface input cost) that is
   different from the router-to-network metric (interface output cost),
   with OSPFv2 it is carried in an MT-ID field ([RFC4915]):


   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                          Link ID                              |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Link Data                             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Type      |     # MT-ID   |            metric             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     MT-ID     |             |1|          MT-ID  metric        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                              ...                              |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   As illustrated above, the lowest bit of the currently reserved field
   between MT-ID and MT-ID metric fields can be set to indicate that
   this is the network-to-router metric for the corresponding topology.
   It is clear that this scheme is compatible with multi-topology.

   For OSPFv3, a TLV can be added to represent the network-to-router
   metric, per draft-acee-ospfv3-lsa-extend (details TBD).

   During intra-area SPF calculation, when a vertex W corresponding to a
   Network LSA is added to the candidate list because of a Type X link
   in a Router LSA for vertex V (that was just added to the shortest-
   path tree), W is marked that it uses Two-part Metric.  Later, when a
   vertex V marked with Two-part Metric (which must correspond to a
   Network LSA) is added to the shortest-path tree, for the vertex W
   that is reached via a link in V's corresponding LSA, the exact
   reverse link (of Type X) from W to V is located from W's
   corresponding Router LSA.  If the reverse link does not exist, W is
   not considered and the next link in V is checked.  If the reverse
   link has a network-to-router metric, that metric is used as the link
   cost between V and W. Otherwise, that reverse link's (default) metric

   is used as the link cost beteen V and W.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA (unless the Link Type values
   in Router LSAs are assigned by IANA).

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security risks.
