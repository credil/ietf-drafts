This document defines a URI scheme, 'go:' to be used with the Common
Name Resolution Protocol.  Specifically it lays out the syntactic
components and how those components are used by URI Resolution to find
the available transports for a CNRP service.  Care should be taken
with several of the URI components because, while they may look like
components found in other URI schemes, they often do not act like
them.  The "go" scheme has more in common with the location
independent "news" scheme than any other URI scheme.

This document is a product of the Common Name Resolution Protocol
Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.
