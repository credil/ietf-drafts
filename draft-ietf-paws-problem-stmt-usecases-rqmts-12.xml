    <abstract>
      <t>Portions of the radio spectrum that are assigned to a particular use
      but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined
      as "white space." The concept of allowing additional transmissions
      (which may or may not be licensed) in white space is a technique to
      "unlock" existing spectrum for new use. An obvious requirement is that
      these additional transmissions do not interfere with the assigned use of
      the spectrum. One approach to using white space spectrum at a given time
      and location is to verify spectrum availability with a database that
      manages spectrum sharing and provides spectrum-availability information.
      The IETF has undertaken to develop a <eref
      target="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-paws-protocol/">Protocol
      to Access Spectrum Database</eref> for such a management database.</t>

      <t>This document describes a number of possible use cases of white space
      spectrum and technology as well as a set of requirements for the
      database query protocol. The concept of white spaces is described along
      with the problems that need to be addressed to enable white space
      spectrum for additional uses without causing interference to currently
      assigned use. Use of white space is enabled by querying a database that
      stores information about spectrum availability at any given location and
      time.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="Introduction to white space">
        <t>Wireless spectrum is a commodity that is regulated by governments.
        The spectrum is used for various purposes, which include, but are not
        limited to, entertainment (e.g., radio and television), communication
        (e.g., telephony and Internet access), military (e.g., radars etc.),
        and navigation (e.g., satellite communication, GPS). Portions of the
        radio spectrum that are assigned to a licensed (primary) user but are
        unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as
        "white space." The concept of allowing additional (secondary)
        transmissions (which may or may not be licensed) in white space is a
        technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new use. An obvious
        requirement is that these secondary transmissions do not interfere
        with the assigned use of the spectrum. One interesting observation is
        that often, in a given physical location, the primary user(s) may not
        be using the entire band assigned to them. The available spectrum for
        secondary transmissions would then depend on the location of the
        secondary user. The fundamental issue is how to determine, for a
        specific location and specific time, if any of the assigned spectrum
        is available for secondary use. Academia and Industry have studied
        multiple <eref
        target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_radio">cognitive
        radio</eref> mechanisms for use in such a scenario. One simple
        mechanism is to use a geospatial database that contains the spatial
        and temporal profile of all primary licensees' spectrum usage, and
        require secondary users to query the database for available spectrum
        that they can use at their location. Such databases can be accessible
        and queryable by secondary users on the Internet.</t>

        <t>Any entity that is assigned spectrum that is not densely used may
        be asked by a governmental regulatory agency to share it to allow for
        more intensive use of the spectrum. Providing a mechanism by which
        secondary users share the spectrum with the primary user is attractive
        in many bands in many countries.</t>

        <t>This document includes the problem statement followed by use cases
        and requirements associated with the use of white space spectrum by
        secondary users via a database query protocol. Note that the IETF has
        undertaken to develop a white space database query protocol (see <eref
        target="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-paws-protocol/">Protocol
        to Access Spectrum Database</eref>.</t>

      <section title="White space database discovery">
        <t>A white space radio network is created by a master device. Before

            database can be identified where the master device is able to
            receive service from the database. If so, it establishes contact

        <t>A simplified operational scenario showing registration consists of
        the following steps:<list style="numbers">
            <t>If required by the regulatory domain, the master device
            registers with its most current and up-to-date information. If
            subject to registration, typically the master device will register
            after power up, after changing location by a predetermined
            distance, and after prescribed time intervals.</t>

            <t>To register with the database, the master device sends
            registration information to the database. This information may
            include the Device ID, serial number assigned by the manufacturer,
            device location, device antenna height above ground, name of the
            individual or business that owns the device, and the name, street
            and email address, and telephone number of a contact person
            responsible for the device's operation.</t>

            <t>The database responds to the registration request with an
            acknowledgement to indicate the success of the registration
            request or with an error if the registration was unsuccessful.
            Additional information may be provided by the database in its
            response according to regulatory requirements.</t>

    <section anchor="" title="Use Cases">
      <t>There are many potential use cases for white space spectrum - for
      example, providing broadband Internet access in urban and
      densely-populated hotspots as well as rural and remote, underserved
      areas. Available white space spectrum may also be used to provide
      Internet 'backhaul' for traditional Wi-Fi hotspots or for use by towns
      and cities to monitor/control traffic lights, read utility meters, and
      the like. Still other use cases include the ability to offload data
      traffic from another Internet access network (e.g., 3G cellular network)
      or to deliver data, information, or a service to a user based on the
      user's location. Some of these use cases are described in the following
      sections.</t>

      <section anchor="SectMasterSlaveUse"
               title="Master-slave white space networks">
        <t>There are a number of common scenarios in which a master white
        space device will act as proxy or mediator for one or more slave
        devices using its connection to the Internet to query the database for
        available spectrum for itself and for one or more slave devices. These
        slave devices may be fixed or mobile, in close proximity with each
        other (indoor network or urban hotspot), or at a distance (rural or
        remote WAN). Once slave devices switch to white space spectrum for
        their communications, they may connect through the master to the
        Internet or use white space spectrum for intra-network communications
        only. The master device can continue to arbitrate and control white
        space communications by slave devices, and may notify them when they
        are required to change white space frequencies or cease white space
        communications.</t>

        <t><xref target="fig2">Figure 2</xref> depicts the general
        architecture such a simple master-slave network, in which the master
        device communicates on its own behalf and on behalf of slave devices

        <t>The protocol requirements for these master-slave device and other
        similar scenarios is essentially the same: the protocol must support
        the ability of a master device to make available-spectrum query
        requests on behalf of slave devices, passing device identification,
        geolocation, and other slave device parameters to the database as
        required to obtain a list of white space spectrum available for use by
        one or more slave devices. Of course, different use cases will use
        this spectrum information in different ways, and the details of
        master/slave communications may be different for different use
        cases.</t>

        <t>Common steps may occur in master-slave networks include the
        following:<list style="numbers">
            <t>The master device powers up.</t>

            <t>Slave devices power up and associate with the master device via
            Wi-Fi or some other over-the-air non-white space spectrum. Until
            the slave device is allocated white space spectrum, any
            master-slave or slave-slave communications occurs over such
            non-white space spectrum.</t>

            <t>The master has Internet connectivity, determines (or knows) its
            location, and establishes a connection to a trusted white space
            database (see Section 4.1.1).</t>

            <t>The master optionally registers with the trusted database (see
            Section 4.1.2).</t>

            <t>The master sends a query to the trusted database requesting a
            list of available white space spectrum based upon its geolocation.
            Query parameters may include the master's location, device
            identifier, and antenna height. Note that the master may relay
            available-spectrum requests to the database on behalf of slave
            devices, then transmit the obtained available-spectrum lists to
            the slaves (or the master may allocate spectrum to slaves from the
            obtained spectrum lists).</t>

            <t>The database responds to the master's query with a list of
            available white space spectrum, associated maximum power levels,
            and a durations of time for spectrum use. If the master made
            requests on behalf of slave devices, the master may transmit the
            obtained available-spectrum lists to the slaves (or the master may
            allocate spectrum to slaves from the obtained spectrum lists).</t>

            <t>The master may inform the database of the spectrum and power
            level it selects from the available spectrum list. If a slave
            device has been allocated available white space spectrum, the
            slave may inform the master of the spectrum and power level it has
            chosen, and the master may, in turn, relay such slave device usage
            to the database.</t>

            <t>Further communication among masters and slaves over the white
            space network may occur via the selected/allocated white space
            spectrum frequencies.</t>

      <section title="Offloading: moving traffic to a white space network">
        <t>This scenario is a variant of the master-slave network described in
        the previous use case. In this scenario, an Internet connectivity
        service is provided over white space as a supplemental or alternative
        datapath to a more costly Internet connection (metered wire service,
        metered wireless service, metered satellite service). In a typical
        deployment scenario, an end user has a primary Internet connection,
        but may prefer to use a connection to the Internet provided by a local
        white space master device that is connected to the Internet.</t>

      <section title="Rapid network deployment during emergency scenario">
        <t>Organizations involved in handling emergency operations maintain an
        infrastructure that relies on dedicated spectrum for their operations.
        However, such infrastructures are often affected by the disasters they
        handle. To set up a replacement network, spectrum needs to be quickly
        cleared and reallocated to the crisis response organization.
        Automation of the this allocation and assignment is often the best
        solution. A preferred option is to make use of a robust protocol that
        has been adopted and implemented by radio manufacturers. A typical
        network topology solution might include wireless access links to the
        public Internet or private network, wireless ad-hoc network radios
        working independent of a fixed infrastructure, and satellite links for
        backup where lack of coverage, overload, or outage of wireless access
        links can occur.</t>

        <t>In the ad-hoc network, all nodes are master nodes that allocate RF
        channels from the white space database (as described in <xref
        target="SectMasterSlaveUse"/>). However, the backhaul link may not be
        available to all nodes, such as depicted for the left node in the
        above figure. To handle RF channel allocation for such nodes, a master
        node with a backhaul link relays or proxies the database query for
        them. So master nodes without a backhaul link follow the procedure as
        defined for clients. The ad-hoc network radios utilize the provided RF
        channels. Details on forming and maintenance of the ad-hoc network,
        including repair of segmented networks caused by segments operating on
        different RF channels, is out of scope of spectrum allocation.</t>

    <section title="Problem Statement">
      <t>The use of white space spectrum is enabled via the capability of a
      device to query a database and obtain information about the availability
      of spectrum for use at a given location. The databases are reachable via
      the Internet and the devices querying these databases are expected to
      have some form of Internet connectivity, directly or indirectly. The
      databases may be regulatory specific since the available spectrum and
      regulations may vary, but the fundamental operation of the protocol
      should be regulatory independent.</t>

      <t/>

      <t>In Figure 11, note that there could be multiple databases serving
      white space devices. The databases are locale specific since the
      regulations and available spectrum may vary. In some countries, for
      example, the U.S., the regulator has determined that multiple databases
      may provide service to White Space Devices.</t>

      <t>A messaging interface between the white space devices and the
      database is required for operating a network using the white space
      spectrum. The following sections discuss various aspects of such an
      interface and the need for a standard.</t>

      <section title="Global applicability">
        <t>The use of white space spectrum is currently approved or being
        considered in multiple regulatory domains, whose rules may differ.
        However, the need for devices that intend to use the spectrum to
        communicate with a database remains a common feature. The database
        implements rules that protect all primary users, independent of the
        characteristics of the white space devices. It also provides a way to
        specify a schedule of use, since some primary users (for example,
        wireless microphones) only operate in limited time slots.</t>

        <t>Devices need to be able to query a database, directly or
        indirectly, over the public Internet and/or private IP networks prior
        to operating in available spectrum. Information about available
        spectrum, schedule, power, etc., are provided by the database as a
        response to the query from a device. The messaging interface needs to
        be:<list style="numbers">
            <t>Radio/air interface agnostic - Any radio/air interface
            technology used by a white space device can be IEEE 802.11af, IEEE
            802.15.4m, IEEE 802.16, IEEE 802.22, LTE etc. However, the
            messaging interface between a master white space device and the
            database should be agnostic to any air interface used for such
            messaging while being cognizant of the characteristics of various
            air-interface technologies and the need to include any relevant
            attributes in the query to the database.</t>

            <t>Spectrum agnostic - the spectrum used by primary and secondary
            users varies by country. Some spectrum has an explicit notion of a
            "channel": a defined swath of spectrum within a band that has some
            assigned identifier. Other spectrum bands may be subject to white
            space sharing, but only have actual frequency low/high parameters
            to define primary and secondary use. The protocol should be able
            to be used in any spectrum band where white space sharing is
            permitted.</t>

            <t>Globally applicable - A common messaging interface between
            white space devices and databases will enable the use of such
            spectrum for various purposes on a global basis. Devices can
            operate in any locale where such spectrum is available and a
            common interface ensures uniformity in implementations and
            deployment. Since the White Space Device must know its geospatial
            location to do a query, it is possible to determine which
            database, and which rules, are applicable, even though they are
            locale specific. Note that although a device may know its
            geolocation, it may not know the country or regulatory domain that
            it is in. Further, even if the device knows this information, it
            may not be sufficient for the device to know its expected
            behaviour in its domain of operation since one domain may adopt a
            rule set for white space device operation from another regulatory
            domain (Brazil may adopt the "FccWhitespace2010" US rule set). To
            allow the global use of white space devices in different countries
            (whatever the regulatory domain), the protocol should support the
            Database communicating applicable rule set information to the
            white space device.</t>

            <t>Flexible and extensible data structures - Different databases
            are likely to have different requirements for the kinds of data
            required for registration (different rule sets that apply to the
            registration of devices) and other messages sent by the device to
            the database. For instance, different regulators might require
            different device-characteristic information to be passed to the
            database.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Database discovery">
        <t>Another aspect of the problem space is the need to discover the
        database. A white space device needs to find the relevant database to
        query, based on its current location or for another location. Since
        the spectrum and databases are domain specific, the device will need
        to discover the relevant database. The device needs to determine the
        location of the specific database to which it can send queries in
        addition to registering itself for operation and using the available
        spectrum.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Protocol">
        <t>A protocol that enables a white space device to query a database to
        obtain information about available spectrum is needed. A device may be
        required to register with the database with some credentials prior to
        being allowed to query. The requirements for such a protocol are
        specified in this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Data model definition">
        <t>The contents of the queries and response need to be specified. A
        data model is required which enables the white space device to query
        the database while including all the relevant information such as
        geolocation, radio technology, power characteristics, etc., which may
        be country and spectrum and regulatory dependent. All databases are
        able to interpret the data model and respond to the queries using the
        same data model that is understood by all devices.</t>

    <section title="Summary and Conclusion">
      <t>Wireless spectrum is a scarce resource. As the demand for spectrum
      grows, there is a need to more efficiently utilize the available and
      allocated spectrum. Cognitive radio technologies enable the efficient
      usage of spectrum via means such as sensing or by querying a database to
      determine available spectrum at a given location for opportunistic use.
      "White space" is the general term used to refer to the bands within the
      spectrum which are available for secondary use at a given location. In
      order to use this spectrum, a device needs to query a database that
      maintains information about the available spectrum within a band. A
      protocol is necessary for communication between the devices and
      databases that is globally applicable.</t>

      <t>The document describes some examples of the role of the white space
      database in the operation of a radio network, and also provides examples
      of services provided to the user of a white space device. From these use
      cases, requirements are determined. These requirements are to be used as
      input for the development of a Protocol to Access White Space database
      (PAWS).</t>
