    <abstract>
		<t>This document provides extensions for the Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to support automatic collection of Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) Information for the TE link formed by a LSP.</t>		
	</abstract>
  </front>

<middle>
	<section title="Introduction">
		<t>It is important to understand which TE links in the network might be at risk from the same failures. In this sense, a set of links may constitute a 'shared risk link group' (SRLG) if they share a resource whose failure may affect all links in the set <xref target="RFC4202"></xref>.</t> 
		<t>On the other hand, as described in <xref target="RFC4206"></xref> and <xref target="RFC6107"></xref>, H-LSP (Hierarchical LSP) or S-LSP (stitched LSP) can be used for carrying one or more other LSPs. Both of the H-LSP and S-LSP can be formed as a TE link. In such cases, it is important to know the SRLG information of the LSPs that will be used to carry further LSPs.</t>
		<t>This document provides an automatic mechanism to collect the SRLG for the TE link formed by a LSP. Note that how to use the collected SRLG information is out of scope of this document</t>

    <section title="RSVP-TE Requirements">
		<section title="SRLG Collection Indication">
			<t>The head nodes of the LSP must be capable of indicating whether the SRLG information of the LSP should be collected during the signaling procedure of setting up an LSP.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="SRLG Collection">
			<t>The SRLG information can be collected during the setup of an LSP. Then the endpoints of the LSP can get the SRLG information and use it for routing, sharing and TE link configuration purposes.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="SRLG Update">
			<t>When the SRLG information changes, the endpoints of the LSP need to be capable of updating the SRLG information of the path. It means that the signaling should be capable of updating the newly SRLG information to the endpoints. </t>

			</list></t>
			<t>The SRLG Collection flag is meaningful on a Path message. If the SRLG Collection flag is set to 1, it means that the SRLG information should be reported to the head and tail node along the setup of the LSP.</t> 
			<t>The rules of the processing of the Attribute Flags TLV are not changed.</t>

	<section title="Signaling Procedures">
		<section title="SRLG Collection">
			<t>Typically, the head node gets the route information of an LSP by adding a RRO which contains the sender&rsquo;s IP addresses in the Path message. If a head node also desires SRLG recording, it sets the SRLG Collection Flag in the Attribute Flags TLV which can be carried in an LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object.</t> 
			<t>When a node receives a Path message which carries an LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object and the SRLG Collection Flag is set, if local policy determines that the SRLG information should not be provided to the endpoints, it must return a PathErr message to reject the Path message. Otherwise, it must add an SRLG sub-object to the RRO to carry the local SRLG information. Then it forwards the Path message to the next node in the downstream direction.</t>
			<t>Following the steps described above, the intermediate nodes of the LSP can collect the SRLG information in the RRO during the forwarding of the Path message hop by hop. When the Path message arrives at the tail node, the tail node can get the SRLG information from the RRO.</t> 
			<t>Before the Resv message is sent to the upstream node, the tail node adds an SRLG sub-object to the RRO. The collected SRLG information can be carried in the SRLG sub-object. Therefore, during the forwarding of the Resv message in the upstream direction, the SRLG information is not needed to be collected hop by hop.</t>
			<t>Based on the above procedure, the endpoints can get the SRLG information automatically. Then the endpoints can for instance advertise it as a TE link to the routing instance based on the procedure described in [RFC6107] and configure the SRLG information of the FA automatically.</t>
			<t>It is noted that a node (e.g. the edge node of a domain) may edit the RRO to remove the route information (e.g. node, interface identifier information) before forwarding it due to some reasons (e.g. confidentiality or reduce the size of RRO), but the SRLG information should be retained if it is desirable for the endpoints of the LSP.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="SRLG Update">
			<t>When the SRLG information of a link is changed, the LSPs using that link should be aware of the changes. The procedures defined in Section 4.4.3 of <xref target="RFC3209">RFC 3209</xref> MUST be used to refresh the SRLG information.</t>

<section title="Manageability Considerations">
	<section title="Policy Configuration ">
		<t>In a border node of inter-domain or inter-layer network, the following SRLG processing policy should be capable of being configured:<list style="symbols">
		<t>Whether the SRLG IDs of the domain or specific layer network can be exposed to the nodes outside the domain or layer network.</t>
		<t>If the SRLG IDs must not be exposed to the nodes outside of the domain or specific layer network by policy, the border node must reject the Path message desiring SRLG recording and send a PathErr message with the defined error code &rsquo;Policy Control Failure&rsquo;/&rsquo;Inter-domain policy failure&rsquo;. </t></list></t>
	</section>
	<section title="Coherent SRLG IDs">
		<t>In a multi-layer multi-domain scenario, SRLG ids may be configured by different management entities in each layer/domain. In such scenarios, maintaining a coherent set of SRLG IDs is a key requirement in order to be able to use the SRLG information properly. Thus, SRLG IDs must be unique. Note that current procedure is targeted towards a scenario where the different layers and domains belong to the same operator, or to several coordinated administrative groups.</t>
		<t>Further scenarios, where coherence in the SRLG IDs cannot be guaranteed are out of the scope of the present document and are left for further study.</t>
