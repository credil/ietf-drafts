     Internet-Draft   <draft-parello-eman-definitions>  Mar 2012 
      
      

         
     1. Introduction 

        Within Energy Management there are terms that may 
        seem obvious to a casual reader but in fact require a 
        rigorous and sourced definition.  To avoid any 
        confusion in terms among the working group drafts, 
        one glossary / lexicon of terms should exist that all 
        drafts can refer to. This will avoid a review of 
        terms multiplied across drafts.  
         
        This draft will contain a glossary of definitions of 
        terms that can be agreed upon by the working group 
        outside of the context of drafts and then included in 
        or sourced to this draft. 
         
        Each term will contain a definition(s), a normative 
        or informative reference, an optional example, an 
        optional comment(s) listed a note(s).  
         
        All terms should be rooted with a well-known 
        reference. If a definition is taken verbatim from a 
        reference then the source is listed in square 
        brackets. If a definition is derived from a well-
        known reference then the source is listed as "Adapted 
        from" with the reference listed in square brackets. 
        If a defined term is newly defined here the reference 
        will indicate as such by stating "herein" and if 
        applicable list any composing terms from this 
        document.  
      
        When applicable the [IEEE100] was used as the 
        preferred source. If a term was not available from 
        [IEEE100], then [IEC60050] was used.  When these were 
        multiple items from [IEEE100], [IEC60050] or 
        [ISO50001], there were all included.

     2. Terminology 

      

     Device 

        A piece of electrical or non-electrical equipment. 
         
       Reference: Adapted from [IEEE100] 
      
     Component 

        A part of an electrical or non-electrical equipment (Device).  
         
       Reference: Adapted from [ITU-T-M-3400] 
        
     Energy Management 

       Energy Management is a set of functions for measuring, 
       modeling, planning, and optimizing networks to ensure 
       that the network elements and attached devices use 
       energy efficiently and is appropriate for the nature 
       of the application and the cost constraints of the 
       organization.  
        
       Reference: Adapted from [ITU-T-M-3400] 
        
       Example: A set of computer systems that will poll 
       electrical meters and store the readings  
        
       NOTES:  
       1. Energy management refers to the activities, methods, 
          procedures and tools that pertain to measuring, 
          modeling, planning, controlling and optimizing the 
          use of energy in networked systems [NMF]. 
        
       2. Energy Management is a management domain which is 
          congruent to any of FCAPS areas of management in the 
          ISO/OSI Network Management Model [TMN]. Energy

          devices is a subset or part of an organization's 
          greater Energy Management Policies. 
        
     Energy Management System (EnMS) 

       An Energy Management System is a combination of 
       hardware and software used to administer a network 
       with the primary purpose being Energy Management. 
        
       Reference: Adapted from [1037C] 
        
       Example: A single computer system that polls data from 
       devices using SNMP 
        
       NOTES: 
       1. An Energy Management System according to [ISO50001] 
          (ISO-EnMS) is a set of systems or procedures upon 
          which organizations can develop and implement an 
          energy policy, set targets, action plans and take 
          into account legal requirements related to energy 
          use.  An EnMS allows organizations to improve energy 
          performance and demonstrate conformity to 
          requirements, standards, and/or legal requirements.   
        
       2. Example ISO-EnMS:  Company A defines a set of 
          policies and procedures indicating there should 
          exist multiple computerized systems that will poll 
          energy from their meters and pricing / source data 
          from their local utility. Company A specifies that 
          their CFO should collect information and summarize 
          it quarterly to be sent to an accounting firm to 
          produce carbon accounting reporting as required by 
          their local government.  
        
       3. For the purposes of EMAN, the definition from 
          [1037C] is the preferred meaning of an Energy 
          Management System (EnMS).  The definition from 
          [ISO50001] can be referred to as ISO Energy 
          Management System (ISO-EnMS).

     ISO Energy Management System 

       Energy Management System as defined by [ISO50001]  
        
       Reference: herein 
      
     Energy  

       That which does work or is capable of doing work. As 
       used by electric utilities, it is generally a 
       reference to electrical energy and is measured in 
       kilo-watt hours (kWh). 
        
       Reference: [IEEE100] 
        
       NOTES 
       1. Energy is the capacity of a system to produce 
          external activity or perform work [ISO50001] 
        
     Power 

       The time rate at which energy is emitted, transferred, 
       or received; usually expressed in watts (or in joules 
       per second). 
       Reference: [IEEE100] 
        
     Demand  

       The average value of power or a related quantity over 
       a specified interval of time. Note: Demand is 
       expressed in kilowatts, kilovolt-amperes, kilovars, or 
       other suitable units. 
        
       Reference: [IEEE100] 
        
       NOTES: 
       1. typically kilowatts

     Internet-Draft   <draft-parello-eman-definitions>  Mar 2012 
      
       2. Energy providers typically bill by Demand 
          measurements as well as for maximum Demand per 
          billing periods.  Power values may spike during 
          short-terms by devices, but Demand measurements 
          recognize that maximum Demand does not equal maximum 
          Power during an interval. 
        
     Power Characteristics 

        Measurements of the electrical current, voltage and frequencies 
        at a given point in an electrical power system. 

        Reference: Adapted from [IEC60050] 

        NOTES:  

        1. Power Characteristics is not intended to be judgmental with 
        respect to a reference or technical value and are independent of 
        any usage context. 

     Power Quality  

       Characteristics of the electric current, voltage and 
       frequencies at a given point in an electric power 
       system, evaluated against a set of reference technical 
       parameters. These parameters might, in some cases, 
       relate to the compatibility between electricity 
       supplied in an electric power system and the loads 
       connected to that electric power system. 
        
       Reference: [IEC60050] 
        
       NOTES:  
       1. Electrical characteristics representing power 
       quality information are typically required by customer 
       facility energy management systems. It is not intended 
       to satisfy the detailed requirements of power quality 
       monitoring. Standards typically also give ranges of 
       allowed values; the information attributes are the raw 
       measurements, not the "yes/no" determination by the 
       various standards.

       identified among all Energy Management Domains; linked 
       to other systems; classified as to type, model, and or 
       manufacturer. 
      
       Reference: herein 
        
     Energy Object Context 

       Energy Object Context is a set of attributes that 
       allow an Energy Management System to classify the use 
       of the Energy Object within an organization.   
        
       Reference: herein 
        
       NOTES:  
       1. The classification could contain the use and/or the 
          ranking of the Energy Object as compared to other 
          Energy Objects in the Energy Management Domain. 
        
         
     Energy Object Relationship 

        An Energy Object Relationship is a functional 
        association among Energy Objects 
         
        NOTES 
        1. Relationships can be named and could include 
          Aggregation, Metering, Power Source, and Proxy.  
           
        2. The Energy Object is the noun or entity in the 
          relationship with the relationship described as the 
          verb. 
           
        Example: If EO x is a piece of Electrical Equipment 
        and EO y is an electrical meter clamped onto x's 
        power cord, then x and y have a Metering 
        Relationship. It follows that y meters x and that x 
        is metered by y.

     Aggregation Relationship 

       An Aggregation Relationship is an Energy Object 
       Relationship where one Energy Object aggregates the 
       Energy Management information of one or more other 
       Energy Objects.  
       These Energy Objects are referred to as having an 
       Aggregation Relationship.   
        
       Reference: herein 
        
       NOTES:  
       1. Aggregate values may be obtained by reading values 
          from multiple Energy Objects and producing a single 
          value of more significant meaning such as average, 
          count, maximum, median, minimum, mode and most 
          commonly sum [SQL]. 
         
     Metering Relationship 

        A Metering Relationship is an Energy Object 
        Relationship where one Energy Object measures the 
        Power or Energy of one or more other Energy Objects.  
         
        These Energy Objects are referred to as having a 
        Metering Relationship. 
           
        Reference: herein 
         
        Example: a PoE port on a switch measures the Power it 
        provides to the connected Energy Object. 
         
         
     Power Source Relationship 

        A Power Source Relationship is an Energy Object 
        Relationship where one Energy Object is the source of 
        or distributor of Power to one or more other Energy 
        Objects.

        These Energy Objects are referred to as having a Power 
        Source Relationship.   
         
        Reference: herein 
         
        Example: a PDU provides power for a connected device. 
         
         
     Proxy Relationship 

        A Proxy Relationship is an Energy Object Relationship 
        where one Energy Object provides the Energy Management 
        capabilities on behalf of one or more other Energy 
        Objects.  
         
        These Energy Objects are referred to as having a Proxy 
        Relationship.  
          
        Reference: herein 
         
        Example: a protocol gateways device for Building 
        Management Systems (BMS) with subtended devices. 
      
         
     Energy Object Parent 

        An Energy Object Parent is an Energy Object that 
        participates in an Energy Object Relationship and is 
        considered as providing the capabilities in the 
        relationship. 
         
        Example: in a Metering Relationship, the Energy Object 
        that is metering is called the Energy Object Parent, 
        while the Energy Object that is metered is called the 
        Energy Object Child.  
         
        Reference: herein 
         
         
     Energy Object Child 

        An Energy Object Child is an Energy Object that 
        participates in an Energy Object Relationship and is 
        considered as receiving the capabilities in the 
        relationship.

     Power State 

        A Power State is a condition or mode of a device that 
        broadly characterizes its capabilities, power 
        consumption, and responsiveness to input. 
         
        Reference: Adapted from [IEEE1621]   
         
        NOTES:  
         
        1. A Power State can be seen as a power setting of an 
          Energy Object that influences the power 
          consumption, the available functionality, and the 
          responsiveness of the Energy Object.   
         
        2. A Power State can be viewed as one method for 
          Energy Control 
         
         
     Power State Set 

        A collection of Power States that comprise one named 
        or logical grouping of control is a Power State Set.   
         
        Reference: herein 
         
        Example: The states {on, off, and sleep} as defined in 
        [IEEE1621], or the 16 power states as defined by the 
        [DMTF] can be considered two different Power State 
        Sets. 
         
         
     Nameplate Power 

        The Nameplate Power is the nominal Power of a Device 
        as specified by the Device manufacturer.

        1. This is typically determined via load testing and 
          is specified by the manufacturer as the maximum 
          value required for operating the device.  This is 
          sometimes referred to as the worst-case Power.  The 
          actual or average Power may be lower.  The 
          Nameplate Power is typically used for provisioning 
          and capacity planning.
