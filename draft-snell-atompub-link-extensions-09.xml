<section title="Introduction"> 
 
<t>This specification adds additional attribute to the Atom Syndication Format
<xref target="RFC4287" /> link and content elements that may be used to express
additional metadata about linked resources most specifically for the purpose
of allowing a consuming application to detect whether a linked resource has 
potentially been modified since the link was established or whether the content
of the linked resource has been correctly fetched as a result of dereferencing
the link.</t>

<section title="Hash Attributes">

<t>Hash digest values are computed by the producers of Atom documents and are 
representative of the state of linked resources at a given point in time. The 
intent of providing hash values is to allow consumers of the Atom document to 
later determine if linked resource have been modified since the document was 
produced. There are, however, many factors that determine whether a consumer 
of a document will be capable of calculating a digest value identical to that 
specified in a hash attribute. Accordingly, hash attribute values MUST be 
considered to be strictly advisory. User agents SHOULD notify users when 
matching hash digest values cannot be computed but MUST NOT stop processing 
or signal an error.</t>

<section title="Computing Hash Digests">

<t>When the resource referenced by atom:link or atom:content elements is 
retrievable using HTTP, hash digest values are computed by first performing 
an HTTP GET request on the URL specified by the @href or @src attributes, 
extracting the returned entity-body, then following the steps specified in 
Section 14.15 of <xref target="RFC2616" />.</t>

</section>
 
<section title="The 'hash' attributes">

<t>The 'hash' Attribute specifies a whitespace-delimited list of hash digest values 
calculated over the resource identified by the atom:link/@href or 
atom:content/@src attributes. Each digest value is represented as a token identifying
the hash algorithm and the hex-encoded digest separated by an ASCII colon (":"). 
The 'hash' attribute MAY appear as a child of the atom:link and atom:content elements.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[ 
  hash = attribute hash { digest-list } 
  digest-list = digest-value *( LWSP digest-value )
  digest-value = token ":" 1*HEXDIG 
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>An example MD5 and SHA-256 digest of an enclosed MP3 file:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  <atom:link rel="enclosure"
    href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
    hash="md5:9e107d9d372bb6826bd81d3542a419d6
          sha-256:6bf05cbbde96d6...d5ffe91e29272d805c98b988dc" />
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>This specification defines the following hash algorithm tokens: "md2", 
"md5", "sha-1", "sha-224", "sha-256", "sha-384", and "sha-512". Additional 
hash algorithms MAY be used.</t>

</section>

</section>
 
<section title="The 'etag' attribute">

<t>The 'etag' Attribute specifies an Entity Tag <xref target="RFC2616"/> for the
resource identified by the atom:link or atom:content element as provided by the 
server hosting the resource. The 'etag' attribute MAY appear as a child of the 
atom:link and atom:content elements.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  etag = attribute etag { entity-tag }

  entity-tag = [ weak ] opaque-tag
  weak       = "W/"
  opaque-tag = quoted-string
  quoted-string  = ( <"> *(qdtext | quoted-pair ) <"> )
  qdtext         = <any TEXT except <">>
  quoted-pair    = "\" CHAR
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>An example weak entity tag for an enclosed MP3 file:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  <atom:link rel="enclosure"
     href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
     etag="W/&quot;xyzzy&quot;" />
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Note that HTTP defines the Entity Tag production such that quotes are 
significant. For example, the values "W/xyzzy" and W/"xyzzy" represent two
distinctly different Entity Tags, the former being considered a "strong" 
entity tag, the latter a "weak" entity tag. The etag attribute value MUST 
include the appropriate double quotation marks.</t> 

<t>The presence and placement of the quotes in the entity tag value can 
introduce some difficulty when inserting the value into the etag attribute.
Producers of Atom documents must either use single quotes when specifying
the value of the etag attribute, e.g. etag='W/"xyzzy"' or use the &amp;quot;
entity reference to escape the double quotes within the etag value, e.g. 
etag="W/&amp;quot;xyzzy&amp;quot;". A strong entity tag would be encoded as either 
etag='"xyzzy"' or etag="&amp;quot;xyzzy&amp;quot;".</t>

</section>

<section title="The 'modified' attribute">

<t>The 'modified' Attribute specifies the date and time when the
resource identified by the atom:link or atom:content element was last
modified. The value MUST conform to the "date-time" production defined by 
<xref target="RFC3339" />. An uppercase "T" character MUST be used to separate 
date and time, and an uppercase "Z" character MUST be present in the absence 
of a numeric time zone offset. The 'modified' attribute MAY appear 
as a child of the atom:link and atom:content elements.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  modified = attribute modified { xsd:dateTime }
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>An example last-modified attribute for an enclosed MP3 file:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  <atom:link rel="enclosure"
    href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
    modified="2010-12-12T12:12:12Z" />
]]></artwork></figure>

</section>
  
<section title="The 'accessed' attribute">

<t>The 'accessed' Attribute specifies the most recent date and time when the
resource identified by the atom:link or atom:content element was 
accessed by the producer of the Atom document. The value MUST conform to the 
"date-time" production defined by <xref target="RFC3339" />.  An uppercase "T" 
character MUST be used to separate date and time, and an uppercase "Z" character 
MUST be present in the absence of a numeric time zone offset. The 'accessed' 
attribute MAY appear as a child of the atom:link and atom:content elements.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  accessed = attribute accessed { xsd:dateTime }
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>An example accessed attribute for an enclosed MP3 file:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  <atom:link rel="enclosure"
    href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
    accessed="2010-12-12T12:12:12Z" />
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The intent of the 'accessed' attribute is to allow the Atom document 
producer to establish an explicit point-in-time at which additional metadata
about the linked resource was established. For instance, if the 'accessed'
attribute is used, a consuming user agent can assume that any hash attribute
values, entity tags and modified timestamps were valid at the date and time
specified by the 'accessed' attributes value. If the 'accessed' attribute is
not specified, consumers SHOULD use the value of the atom:updated element to
determine the point-in-time at which the link metadata was considered to be 
valid.</t>

</section>
  
<section title="Security Considerations"> 
  <t>The 'hash', 'etag' and 'modified' attributes are intended to 
  allow an Atom publisher the means of describing the state of a linked 
  resource at a point-in-time -- usually at the moment specified 
  by the 'accessed' attribute or at the moment specified by the atom:updated
  element. An Atom consumer that is aware of these attributes can use their 
  values as an integrity check to determine if the linked resource has been 
  modified since the attribute values were established by the publisher.</t>
  
  <t>The 'hash' attribute is intended for use when the publisher of an Atom 
  document requires the ability to link to a specific version of a resource
  that is expected to remain stable and unchanged for a useful period of time.
  If publishers fall into the habit of regularly including hash digests for 
  resources whose states change frequently, there is a danger that consumers 
  of feeds containing large numbers of invalid digests will simply begin to
  ignore them and completely undermine the utility of the attribute.</t>
