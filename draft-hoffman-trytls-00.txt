          Optimistic Encryption using TLS Signaling in the DNS
                        draft-hoffman-trytls-00

Abstract

   Many Internet servers offer content in two transports: unencryped,
   and encrypted with TLS.  A user who accesses some content with a URL
   that indicates unencrypted (such as "http:") might prefer to get the
   content encrypted but doesn't bother to change the URL to indicate
   this.  This proposal allows Internet clients, particularly web
   clients and mail user agents, to do a DNS lookup to see whether they
   might expect content for a particular host to also be available under
   TLS.  Using the DNS for this is much faster than attempting a TLS
   session that might time out or take many round trips in order to
   discover that the content is not available.

1.  Introduction

   Starting a TLS [RFC5246] session takes time and resources, so
   applications tend not to do it unless specifically asked, such as
   when a user enters a "https:" or "imaps:" URL.  The downside of this
   is that some Internet traffic that might be encrypted goes
   unencrypted even when a user might want encryption.

   A classic example of this problem is a web user who cares about
   encrypting as much content as possible and is willing to type URLs
   with "https:", but goes to a web page whose URLs are all "http".
   Some of those pages might be served under either "http:" or "https:",
   but you can't specify both in an HTML page.

   Although most people think of this as a problem for HTTP [RFC2817],
   it also affects mail user agents that use either POP [RFC1939] or
   IMAP [RFC3501].  Although it is uncommon to see "pop:" or "imap:"
   URLs, many applications use them internally.  Allowing servers that
   allow both the unencrypted and encrypted versions of these protocols
   would also go a long way towards encrypting more traffic on the
   Internet.

   A potential solution to this problem is to allow a site operator to
   tell applications that content that is available unencrypted is
   likely to also be available encrypted with TLS.  If the application
   can do a quick check for TLS availability, the application might be
   more willing to risk the setup time for TLS.  This document proposed
   to do that with a new DNS RRtype, TRYTLS, that is a non-binding
   indicator from the site owner that clients that can use TLS coming to
   this domain name are likely to find a TLS server for a particular
   protocol.

2.  The TRYTLS Resource Record

   The TRYTLS resource record type, whose value is TBD1, lists the port
   on which a particular TLS-based service might be found for a given
   application protocol.

   The presentation format is:

   _appname.hostname IN TRYTLS sec-port

   The application name ("_appname") being queried is taken from a new
   IANA registry.  The initial values for the names in the registry are
   "_http", "_pop", and "_imap".

   The secure port number (called "sec-port") is a two-octet positive
   integer.

3.  Semantics of the TRYTLS Record

   The lack of a TRYTLS record in a zone implies absolutely nothing.

   The presence of a TRYTLS record for a particular application type
   indicates that there is likely to be a server for that protocol,
   running under TLS, at the port number given.  There is absolutely no
   guarantee that such a server exists, or that the TLS server's
   certificate will be trusted by any particular client.  If the record
   exists, the port number in the response is the port number a client
   should use to access the server over TLS.

   The presence of a TRYTLS record for HTTP (such as
   "_http.www.example.com") indicates that some HTTP origins which have
   the given hostname will also be availble over TLS.  The presence of
   such a record does not indicate that all origins, or all specific
   URLs that include those origins, will be served under TLS.

   The existence or absence of a TRYTLS record does not have any effect
   on other ways of discovering whether there is a TLS service for a
   particular application.  For example, a recent Internet-Draft (draft-
   nottingham-http2-encryption) proposes a different method to make
   information similar to the TRYTLS record available, but instead uses
   a header in the HTTP response.

4.  IANA Considerations

   ** Insert DNS RRtype template here for TRYTLS that assigns TBD1.  **

   ** Create a new registry for _appname **

5.  Security Considerations

   There is a general positive security effect on the Internet when more
   traffic is encrypted.  There are probably some exceptions to this
   statement, and probably some people who would say that the effect is
   much more positive than "general".

   There is no reason to require TRYTLS to be protected by DNSSEC.  An
   attacker who adds a TRYTLS record when TLS is not available will
   cause a slight denial-of-service attack, but one that is not much
   worse than the case today where a client might try a TLS connection
   anyway.  ((( More thinking about this is needed.  )))
