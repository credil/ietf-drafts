                     VLAN Identifier option in DHCP
                  draft-zhu-dhc-vlan-id-option-01.txt

Abstract

   This document defines a new option for the Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol for IPv4 and IPv6.  This option can be used by the DHCP
   server to carry the VLAN identifier to the DHCP client to distinguish
   different connections in the access network.

Internet-Draft       VLAN Identifier option in DHCP           April 2013


1.  Introduction

   There are some use cases where the mobile node can access to one core
   network through another access network, such as using WLAN access to
   the 3GPP EPC network.  Currently the mobile node will always
   establish one connection using the WLAN network, but 3GPP EPC network
   can support multiple connections to be established for one mobile
   node.  As the WLAN is a kind of share link access network, to support
   multiple connections establishment, some kinds of identifiers can be
   used to distinguish the different connections associated with the
   mobile node, and the VLAN identifier is proposed to be used here.

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is built on a client-
   server model, where designated DHCP server allocate network addresses
   and deliver configuration parameters to dynamically configured hosts.
   The DHCP server is the right network entity to carry the VLAN
   identifier for each connection to the DHCP client which collocated
   with the mobile node.

   The changes to [RFC2131,RFC3315] defined in this document introduce a
   new DHCP option to carry the VLAN identifier by the DHCP server to
   the DHCP client.


2.  Conventions & Terminology

2.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the DHCP related terms used in this document to be interpreted as
   defined in the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol v4
   (DHCPv4)[RFC2131] and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol v6
   (DHCPv6)[RFC3315] specifications.  DHCP refers to both DHCPv4 and
   DHCPv6 messages and entities throughout this document.


3.  VLAN ID Option Format

   VLAN Identifier option carries information to identify the different
   connections associate with one mobile node.

   The format of the VLAN-Identifier option is shown below.

      802.11.


4.  DHCP Client Behavior

   The DHCP Client may ignore the VLAN identifier option in the payload
   of downstream DHCP messages from DHCP server if it is unable to
   understand.


5.  DHCP Server Behavior

   DHCP server may include the VLAN identifier option in the payload of
   DHCP messages sent to the DHCP client.  The VLAN identifier
   information in the DHCP server is generated by other network
   elements, such as WLAN Access Gateway, and how can these information
   to be carried to DHCP server is out of scope of this document.


6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD


7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not have security considerations.
