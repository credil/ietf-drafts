1. Introduction

   The Digital Television Group (DTG) is an industry organisation
   representing the digital television industry; it brings together
   broadcasters, service providers, manufacturers and other key
   stakeholders to define detailed broadcast and receiver specifications
   and provide regimes to measure conformance against brand
   requirements.  The Group publishes and maintains the technical
   specification for the UK's Freeview and Freeview HD platforms.  See
   <http://dtg.org.uk/dtg/objectives.html> for more information.

   This document defines a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for
   said DTG specifications.  URNs, defined in RFC 2141 [RFC2141],
   provide a way of assigning persistent identifiers to a variety of
   different resources.  As far as such type of identifiers is desired
   for DTG specifications, URNs are what the choice falls on.

   Please consult RFC 3406 [RFC3406] for procedure of registration of

   URN namespaces.  This document specifies a formal namespace (see RFC
   3406 for the distinction).

2. Registration Template for 'dtg' URN Namespace

   This section contains the registration template for 'dtg' URN
   namespace, as required by RFC 3406.

2.1. Namespace Identifier (NID)

   The name of the namespace is "dtg".

2.2. Registration Information

   Registration version number: 1

   Registration date: yyyy-mm-dd [RFC-Editor: Please replace with the
   date of publication of this document]

2.3. Declared Registrant of the Namespace

   Registering organization
   	Name: Digital Television Group (DTG)
   	Address: Level 5, 89 Albert Embankment, London, SW8 5NQ UK     
   Designated contact person:
   	Name: Ali Teffahi
   	Email: registration@dtg.org.uk

2.4. Declaration of Syntactic Structure

   The 'dtg' URN (a URN within 'dtg' namespace) takes the form expressed
   in <dtg-urn> production, defined using Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) [RFC5234]:

     dtg-urn    = "urn:dtg:" dtg-urn-id

   where <dtg-urn-id> is an identifier that is internally assigned by
   the DTG.  The <dtg-urn-id> production must conform to syntax defined
   for <NSS> in RFC 2141:

     dtg-urn-id = 1*<URN chars>

   Note: RFC 2141 did not use modern ABNF, and therefore <URN chars> is
   given as ABNF "prose value" above.

2.5. Relevant Ancillary Documentation

   The DTG maintains the list of currently assigned 'dtg' URNs ('dtg'

   URNs Register) at the "DTG URNs" tab of
   <http://www.dtg.org.uk/publications/books.html> page.  The procedures
   DTG follows when assigning new URNs in the 'dtg' namespace are also
   available there.

2.6. Identifier Uniqueness Considerations

   All URNs defined by DTG during the standardization work carried out
   within the organization shall be considered globally unique because
   of the combination of:

   (1) the 'dtg' NID uniquely registered to DTG by IANA, which is the
       subject of this document; and 

   (2) a <dtg-urn-id> registered within the organization's maintenance
       system, as specified in Section 2.5 above.

2.7. Identifier Persistence Considerations

   Assignment of 'dtg' URNs will only be available through the DTG via
   its private membership.

   DTG will act with best intention to ensure that referenced URNs
   remain accessible and persistent while relevant and after the
   "lifetime of the resource" to ensure that other parties attempting to
   access any DTG specification will still be able to do so.

   Where the specifications from where the URNs are referenced are
   updated, the URN for later versions of the documents carrying those
   URNs will also be updated by the versioning information within the
   URN, and each version of the document will have its own URN.

2.8. Process of Identifier Assignment

   The URNs in the 'dtg' namespace will be assigned by request of DTG
   working group, and the assignment will be approved by DTG Technical
   Council.  When the request is approved, DTG Technical Administrator
   will enter the assignment information in the 'dtg' URNs Register,
   mentioned in Section 2.5.  The details of this process are spelled
   out in the document that may be found at the location which is
   mentioned ibidem.

   DTG may also delegate a part of its namespace to a particular body;
   in this case further assignment within delegated parts will be a
   subject to such body's internal rules.

2.9. Process for Identifier Resolution

   Resolution of 'dtg' URNs is controlled by entities to which
   assignment has been delegated, or the DTG itself.  Further details
   are out of the scope of this document.

2.10. Rules for Lexical Equivalence

   The 'dtg' URNs are subject to rules of RFC 3986 [RFC3986] with
   respect to their lexical equivalence, taking into account that <dtg-
   urn-id> shall be considered to be case-insensitive.

2.11. Conformance with URN Syntax

   As <dtg-urn-id> conforms to syntax set forth in RFC 2141:

     dtg-urn-id = 1*<URN chars>

   and namespace identifier is in strict accordance with above-
   referenced URN specification, any 'dtg' URN is compatible with
   generic URN syntax.

2.12. Validation Mechanism

   The validation mechanism of the 'dtg' URNs is not currently defined.

2.13. Scope

   The scope is global: 'dtg' URNs are suitable for use with broad
   Internet community, even though they are primarily scoped for use
   within the DTG.

3. Examples

   The following are examples of 'dtg' URNs which are syntactically
   correct, but are provided for pedagogical reasons only.  They are not
   guaranteed to be assigned and resolvable.

   The examples of 'dtg' URNs include:

   urn:dtg:metadata:2011-9
   urn:dtg:metadata:2011-11
   urn:dtg:measurement:2011-12
   urn:dtg:security:2011-12

4. Security Considerations

   'dtg' URNs impose no additional security considerations other than

INTERNET DRAFT         URN Namespace for the DTG        October 24, 2011


   those normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in
   general.

5. Namespace Considerations

   The justification for defining a URN namespace for DTG documents is
   spelled out in Section 1.  Briefly, it is necessary to provide a
   means of assigning permanent reference points to DTG technical
   specifications.

6. Community Considerations

   As 'dtg' URNs are primarily scoped to use within DTG and the bodies
   which it is tightly related to, the assignment of UENs in this
   namespace will be available through private DTG membership only. 
   However, they still remain usable in the global Internet.

7. IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the 'dtg' URN namespace using the template
   found in Section 2 with reference to this document.
