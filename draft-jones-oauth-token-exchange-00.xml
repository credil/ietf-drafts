      <t>
	This specification defines how to request and obtain
	Security Tokens from OAuth Authorization Servers <xref target="RFC6749"/>,
	including enabling one party to act on behalf of another or
	enabling one party to delegate authority to another.
	This functionality is intentionally parallel to the
	functionality defined by <xref target="WS-Trust"/>,
	including On-Behalf-Of and Act-As.
      </t>
      <t>
	A Security Token is a set of information that facilitates
	the sharing of identity and security information across security domains.
	Examples of Security Tokens include
	JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) <xref target="JWT"/> and
	SAML Assertions <xref target="OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os"/>.
	Security Tokens are typically signed to achieve integrity
	and sometimes also encrypted to achieve confidentiality.
	Security Tokens are also described as Assertions in
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-assertions"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines a new Security Token Request
	Grant Type used at the Token Endpoint to convey the parameters for
	a Security Token request and Security Token response parameter
	used in responses to these requests.
	The Security Token Request is a
	<xref target="JWT">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref>
	that is signed by the requesting party
	that contains parameters of the request as Claims.
      </t>
      <t>
	The Security Tokens obtained could be used in a number of contexts,
	the specifics of which are beyond the scope of this specification.
	Examples include using them with the

      <section anchor="rnc" title="Requirements Notation and Conventions">
	<t>
	  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
	  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
	  document are to be interpreted as described in
	  <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>
	  This specification uses the terms "Authorization Server"
	  "Token Endpoint", "Token Request", and "Token Response"
	  defined by <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref>,
	  and the terms "Claim" and "JWT Claims Set" defined by
	  <xref target="JWT">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref>.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="On-Behalf-Of vs. Impersonation Semantics">
	<t>
	  When principal A acts on behalf of principal B, A is given all
	  the rights that B has within some defined rights context.
	  Whereas, with on-behalf-of semantics, principal A still has its own identity
	  separate from B and it is explicitly understood that while B
	  may have delegated its rights to A, any actions taken are
	  being taken by A and not B. In a sense, A is an agent for B.
	</t>
	<t>
	  On-behalf-of semantics are therefore different than
	  impersonation semantics, with which it is sometimes
	  confused. When principal A impersonates principal B, then in
	  so far as any entity receiving Claims is concerned, they are
	  actually dealing with B. It is true that some members of the
	  identity system might have awareness that impersonation is
	  going on but it is not a requirement. For all intents and
	  purposes, when A is acting for B, A is B.

    <section anchor="Actor" title="Conveying Eligibility to Act As Another Party">
      <t>
	It is useful to be able to make a statement that one party is authorized
	to act on behalf of another party.
	This can be done by having the party being acted for sign
	a Security Token containing a Claim identifying party that will
	act for it as an authorized actor.
	This statement can also optionally identify scopes in which
	the actor is eligible to act through another Claim.
	The following Claims are defined for use in JWTs for these purposes:

	<list style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="actor">
	    Security Token that identifies a party who is asserted as being eligible
	    to act for the party identified by the JWT containing this Claim.
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="scopes">
	    OPTIONAL.
	    An array of strings, each of which represents a service context
	    for which the actor is asserted as being eligible
	    to act for the party identified by the JWT containing this Claim.
	    The array MUST contain at least one scope value.
	    The definition of these contexts is outside the scope of this specification.

    </section>

    <section anchor="ImplementationConsiderations" title="Implementation Considerations">
      <t>
	Implementations of the specification MUST implement support for using JWTs

    <section anchor="OpenIssues" title="Open Issues">
      <t>
	The following decisions need to be made and updates this spec performed:
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>
	    Should we say anything about proof of possession of
	    the target party's key in the On-Behalf-Of case
	    beyond specifying the use of the <spanx style="verb">actor</spanx> Claim?
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Revise the text in the On-Behalf-Of vs. Impersonation Semantics section
	    to better align the terminology used with the semantics specified.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
        The <spanx style="verb">security_token_request</spanx>
	Grant Type is to be registered in the
	OAuth Parameters registry.
      </t>
      <t>
        The <spanx style="verb">scopes</spanx>,
	<spanx style="verb">act_as</spanx>, and
	<spanx style="verb">on_behalf_of</spanx>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        All of the normal security issues, especially in relationship
        to comparing URIs and dealing with unrecognized values, that
        are discussed in <xref target="JWT">JWT</xref> also apply
        here.
      </t>
      <t>
        In addition, on-behalf-of introduces its own unique security
        issues.  Any time one principal is delegated the rights of
        another principal, the potential for abuse is always a concern.
	That is why use of the <spanx style="verb">scopes</spanx>
	member is suggested.
	The scope values restrict the contexts in which
	the delegated rights can be exercised.
