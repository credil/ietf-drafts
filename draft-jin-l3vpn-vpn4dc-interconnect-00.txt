              L3VPN automatical interconnection for VPN4DC
               draft-jin-l3vpn-vpn4dc-interconnect-00.txt

Abstract

   VPN4DC provides VPN oriented datacenter service to customer through
   L3VPN which is consisted of (private) L3VPN in datacenter and network
   provider's L3VPN over wide geographical area.  If we considering the
   two L3VPN in two different AS, [RFC4364] providers three options to
   achieve L3VPN inter-AS connection.  Both option A and B could be used
   to connect L3VPN in VPN4DC.  This draft discusses a novel method for
   implementing option A, to automatically configure the VRF interface
   in order to interconnect the two segments of the end-to-end L3VPN.
   This L3VPN interconnection automation mechanism is expected to
   significantly reduce the VPN oriented inter-connection/service
   provisioning time.

1.  Introduction

   VPN4DC provides VPN oriented datacenter service to customer through
   L3VPN which is consisted of (private) L3VPN in datacenter and network
   provider's L3VPN over wide geographical area.  If we considering the
   two L3VPN in two different AS, [RFC4364] providers three options to
   achieve L3VPN inter-AS connection.  Both option A and B could be used
   to connect L3VPN in VPN4DC.  For option A, operator should configure
   the local VRF interface on both border PEs of two L3VPNs to construct
   a VRF-to-VRF interconnection network, while deploying option B, the
   border PE router in datacenter should support MPLS or other kinds of
   tunnel to connect peer border PE in L3VPN.

   VRF-to-VRF interconnection on two border PEs is achieved by the sub-
   interface, and each border PE will consider the other border PE in
   peer L3VPN as CE.  VRF-to-VRF interconnection could provide better
   connection access control for network provider when providing
   datacenter!_s L3VPN access.  The pain point for VRF-to-VRF
   interconnection is that operator has to manually configure the sub-
   interface on both border PEs of the two L3VPN, which greatly
   increases service provisioning time and wrong configuration
   probability.

   This draft discusses a novel method for implementing option A, to
   automatically configure the VRF interface in order to interconnect
   the two segments of the end-to-end L3VPN.  This L3VPN interconnection
   automation mechanism is expected to significantly reduce the VPN
   oriented inter-connection/service provisioning time.


2.  Interconnect VRF interface attribute encoding

   In order to automatically configure the VRF interface to achieve VRF-
   to-VRF interconnection, the VRF interface should be advertised by MP-
   BGP IPv4/v6 VPN-route.  This document defines a new BGP attribute,
   called interconnect VRF interface attribute.  This is an optional
   transitive BGP attribute.

   -  VLAN value could contain one or two VLAN tags, and each VLAN tag
      should contain 32bits as specified in [IEEE802.1Q].


3.  Link connection discovery

   Prior L3VPN auto-connection, the two border PEs in corresponding
   L3VPN MUST discover the physical link connection between them.  A
   physical link connection pair should be established after this
   discovery.  The physical link connection pair could be presented as
   (<Local System identifier, Local Port ID>, <Peer System identifier,
   Peer Port ID>).  There are various ways to achieve the link
   connection discovery, e.g, LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol)
   [IEEE802.1AB] or manual configuration, and out of the scope of this
   draft.

   VRF link connection pair presented as (<Local System identifier,
   Local Port ID, VLAN value>, <Peer System identifier, Peer Port ID,
   VLAN value>), which indicates the sub-link connecting two border PEs,
   see more detail in section 4.  The VLAN value in the above link
   connection pair should have same VLAN ID, and would refer to one or
   two VLAN tags.


4.  PE procedures

   The E-BGP session should be established between the two border PEs.
   The procedure of PE is the same as defined in [RFC4364] except the
   following.

   If the border PE already has VRF link connection pair for the
   corresponding VRF, interconnect VRF interface attribute is derived
   from <Local System identifier, Local Port ID, VLAN value>.  Then
   border PE advertises VPN-Route of the VRF with the interconnect VRF
   interface attribute.

   If the border PE does not have VRF link connection pair, and if
   border PE acts as active role, it should assign a VLAN number which
   has not been used yet, and then generate <Local System identifier,
   Local Port ID, VLAN value>, and then border PE advertises VPN-Route
   of the VRF with the interconnect VRF interface attribute.  If border
   PE is a passive role without VRF link connection pair, it should not
   advertise VPN-Route to peer border PE.

   When PE receiving VPN-route with interconnect VRF interface
   attribute, it should use this attribute to search the VRF link
   connection pairs to match <Peer System identifier, Peer Port ID, VLAN
   value>.  If found, then corresponding <Local System identifier, Local

   Port ID, VLAN value> should be the output interface of this VRF to
   peer border PE.  If does not find, it should search the physical link
   connection pair without VLAN number and find its corresponding <Local
   System identifier, Local Port ID>, and assigning the same VLAN number
   as carried in the attribute, then VRF link connection pair is
   generated.  Then new <Local System identifier, Local Port ID, VLAN
   value> should be the output interface of this VRF to peer border PE.

   If the PE could not assign the VLAN number as carried in the
   attribute, a BGP notification message should be generated to peer
   border PE with UPDATE Message Error sub-code named "invalid VRF
   interface attribute with VLAN number".  Border PE receiving such kind
   of error code in BGP notification message could assign another VLAN
   number locally, and send BGP UPDATE message again to peer border PE.


5.  Security considerations

   The VRF-Route with interconnect VRF interface attribute described in
   this draft would trigger the PE to configure VLAN number
   automatically, which possibly leads to potential threat by some
   unauthorized VRF-Route with this new attribute.  The physical link
   connection pair restricts the VLAN number assignment to only those
   interfaces with peer border PE.  BGP MD5 authentication should also
   be enabled to ensure security.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP optional transitive attribute, called
   interconnect VRF interface attribute.

   This document defines a new UPDATE Message Error sub-code, called
   "invalid VRF interface attribute with VLAN number".
