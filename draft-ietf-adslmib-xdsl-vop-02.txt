1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Overview

   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for
   use with network management protocols in the Internet community for
   the purpose of managing VDSL2, ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines.

   The MIB module described in RFC 2662 [RFC2662] describes objects used
   for managing Asymmetric Bit-Rate DSL (ADSL) interfaces per
   [T1E1.413], [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].  These object descriptions are
   based upon the specifications for the ADSL Embedded Operations
   Channel (EOC) as defined in American National Standards Institute
   (ANSI) T1E1.413/1995 [T1E1.413] and International Telecommunication
   Union (ITU-T) G.992.1 [G.992.1] and G.992.2 [G.992.2].

   The MIB module described in RFC 4706 [RFC4706] is a wider management
   model that includes, in addition to ADSL technology, the ADSL2 and
   ADSL2+ technologies per G.992.3, G.992.4, and G.992.5 ([G.992.3],
   [G.992.4], and [G.992.5], respectively).

   This document does not obsolete RFC 2662 [RFC2662] or RFC 4706
   [RFC4706], but rather provides a more comprehensive management model
   that addresses the VDSL2 technology per G.993.2 ([G.993.2]) as well
   as ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ technologies.

   This document does not obsolete RFC 2662 [RFC2662] or RFC 4706
   [RFC4706].  RFC 2662 is relevant only for managing modems that do not
   support any DSL technology other than ADSL (e.g., G.992.1 [G.992.1]
   and G.992.2 [G.992.2]) especially if the modems were produced prior
   to approval of ITU-T G.997.1 standard revision 3 [G.997.1].  RFC 4706
   is more appropriate for managing modems that support ADSL2 technology
   variants (with or without being able to support the legacy ADSL).
   This document supports all ADSL, ADSL2, and VDSL2 standards, but it
   assumes a more sophisticated management model, which older modems
   (even ADSL2 ones) may not be able to support.  The selection of the
   appropriate MIB module for any DSL modem is based on the ifType value
   it reports, as explained in the next section.

   The management framework for VDSL2 lines [TR-129] specified by the
   Digital Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF) has been taken into
   consideration.  That framework is based on the ITU-T G.997.1 standard
   [G.997.1] and its amendment 1 [G.997.1-Am1].

   Note that the management model, according to this document, does not
   allow managing VDSL technology per G.993.1 [G.993.1].  VDSL lines
   MUST be managed by RFC 3728 [RFC3728].

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                  August 2013


   The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission,
   as discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 2863 [RFC2863]) section of
   this document.

2.1.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   This section outlines the relationship of this MIB module with other
   MIB modules described in RFCs.  Specifically, IF-MIB as defined in
   RFC 2863 [RFC2863] and ENTITY-MIB as defined in RFC 4133 [RFC4133]
   are discussed.

2.1.1.  Relationship with previous VDSL2-LINE-MIB (RFC 5650)

   This section outlines the relationship of this MIB module with the
   previous VDSL2-LINE-MIB MIB module.

   The purpose of this MIB module is to extend the MIB module defined in
   RFC 5650.  This MIB module corrects errors that exist in RFC 5650 as
   well as adds new XDSL management objects.  This MIB module provides a
   new way to store and reference XDSL line configuration data.  This
   MIB module has been designed to be as compatible with RFC 5650 as
   possible but is not 100 percent backward compatible with RFC 5650.

   This MIB module provides a new way to store and reference XDSL line
   configuration data and this new mechanism is called a Vector of
   Profiles.  From this point forward, RFC 5650 will be referred to as
   the legacy management model and this document will be refered to as
   the new management model.  The new management model is also called
   the Vector of Profiles management model and the legacy management
   model is known as the Template management model.

   This MIB module contains all of the management objects defined in RFC
   5650 as well as some additional management objects that are required
   by the Vector of Profiles management model.  Some of the management
   objects defined in RFC 5650 have been changed to correct errors and
   some of the management objects defined in RFC 5650 have been extended
   to support new functionality defined in ITU-T G.997.1 since the
   publication of RFC 5650.

   Each XDSL line requires a large amount of configuration data to
   operate correctly.  In RFC 5650, the configuration data required by
   each line is stored in an object called a template.  In this MIB
   module, the configuration data required by each line is stored in an
   object called a Vector of Profiles ( or a vector for short ).  Hence
   one of the major differences between this MIB module and RFC 5650 is
   that configuration data is stored in a vector in this MIB module and
   configuration data is stored in a template in the RFC 5650 MIB
   module.  For the purpose of backward compatability, the template



Morgenstern, et al.     Expires February 02, 2014               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                  August 2013


   management objects remain defined in this MIB module but are
   described as belonging to the legacy management model.

   New implementations of the VDSL2-LINE-MIB, should use the Vector of
   Profiles management model instead of the template management model
   because it is a much more efficient way to store the configuration
   data.  In addition, new implementations should use the Vector of
   Profiles management model because new management objects defined in
   ITU-T G.997.1 have been added to the vector model and have not been
   added to the template model.

   In order for the SNMP manager (the management system) be able to
   determine whether a specific DSLAM supports the Vector of Profiles
   management model, or the template management model, it can GET the
   value of xdsl2ScalarVopAttachmentMethodCapabilties which also selects
   between two modes of the Vector of Profiles, as explained later on in
   this document.  If a DSLAM does not support the Vector of Profiles
   management mode then access to that managed object is supposed to
   fail with SNMP error-code='noSuchName'.

2.1.1.1.  New management objects defined in this MIB module

   This MIB module defines a number of additional management objects
   compared to RFC 5650.  The following management objects are required
   by the Vector of Profiles management model and are defined in this
   module.

   xdsl2ScalarVopAttachmentMethodCapabilties

   xdsl2ScalarVopAttachmentMethodConfigured

   xdsl2ScalarVopAttachmentMethodCurrent

   xdsl2VopVectorIndexNext

   xdsl2VopLineTable

2.1.1.2.  Legacy management objects defined in this MIB module

   This MIB module continues to define the management objects required
   by the legacy management model for the purpose of backward
   compatibility.  The legacy management objects are listed here :

   xdsl2LineConfTemplate

   xdsl2LineConfFallbackTemplate

   xdsl2LineStatusActTemplate

   xdsl2LineConfTemplateTable

   xdsl2LineConfProfTable

   xdsl2ChConfProfileTable

2.1.1.3.  Errors corrected and Changes made to objects from RFC 5650

   Some changes were made to objects defined in RFC 5650 in order to
   correct errors.  In addition, some changes were made in order to
   properly align the object definitions with ITU-T G.997.1.  The
   changes made are listed here :

   - Textual Convention Xdsl2TransmissionModeType was modified to
   include G.992.3 Annex C definitions and G.992.5 Annex C definitions.

   - Textual Convention Xdsl2OperationModes was modified to include
   G.992.3 Annex C definitions and G.992.5 Annex C definitions.

   - Textual Convention Xdsl2ScMaskDs was modified from SIZE(0..512) to
   SIZE(0..64).

   - Textual Convention Xdsl2ScMaskUs was modified from SIZE(0..512) to
   SIZE(0..8).

   - Textual Convention Xdsl2LineTxRefVnDs was changed such that the
   third octet has a different interpretation.

   - Textual Convention Xdsl2LineTxRefVnUs was changed such that the
   third octet has a different interpretation.

   - The object xdsl2LConfProfScMaskDs has a modified description.

   - The object xdsl2LConfProfScMaskUs has a modified description.

2.1.2.  Relationship with IF-MIB (RFC 2863)

2.1.2.1.  General IF-MIB Integration

   The VDSL2 Line MIB specifies the detailed objects of a data
   interface.  As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2863 [RFC2863].
   The IANA has assigned the following ifTypes, which may be applicable
   for VDSL2 lines as well as for ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines:

   IANAifType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       ...
   SYNTAX INTEGER {
       ...
       channel(70),     -- Channel
       adsl(94),        -- Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop
       ...
       interleave(124), -- Interleaved Channel
       fast(125),       -- Fast Channel
       ...
       adsl2plus(238),  -- Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop Version 2,
                           Version 2 Plus, and all variants
       vdsl2(251),      -- Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Loop 2
       ...
       }


   ADSL lines that are identified with ifType=adsl(94) MUST be managed
   with the MIB specified by RFC 2662.  ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines
   identified with ifType=adsl2plus(238) MUST be managed with the MIB
   specified by RFC 4706 [RFC4706].  VDSL2, ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+
   lines identified with ifType=vdsl2(251) MUST be managed with the MIB
   specified by this document.

   In any case, the SNMP agent may use either ifType=interleave(124) or
   fast(125) for each channel, e.g., depending on whether or not it is
   capable of using an interleaver on that channel.  It may use the
   ifType=channel (70) when all channels are capable of using an
   interleaver (e.g., for ADSL2 xTUs).

   Note that the ifFixedLengthGroup from RFC 2863 [RFC2863] MUST be
   supported and that the ifRcvAddressGroup does not apply to this MIB
   module.

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                  August 2013


2.1.2.2.  Usage of ifTable

   The MIB branch identified by ifType contains tables appropriate for
   the interface types described above.  Most such tables extend the
   ifEntry table, and are indexed by ifIndex.  For interfaces in systems
   implementing this MIB module, those table entries indexed by ifIndex
   MUST be persistent.

   The following objects are part of the mandatory
   ifGeneralInformationGroup in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863], and are
   not duplicated in the VDSL2 Line MIB.

      ifIndex                  Interface index.

      ifDescr                  See interfaces MIB.

      ifType                   vdsl2(251), channel(70),
                               interleave(124), or fast(125)

      ifSpeed                  Set as appropriate.

      ifPhysAddress            This object MUST have an octet
                               string with zero length.

      ifAdminStatus            See interfaces MIB.

      ifOperStatus             See interfaces MIB.

      ifLastChange             See interfaces MIB.

      ifName                   See interfaces MIB.

      ifAlias                  See interfaces MIB.

      ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable   Default to enabled(1).

      ifHighSpeed              Set as appropriate.

      ifConnectorPresent       Set as appropriate.

2.1.2.3.  Usage of ifStackTable

   Use of the ifStackTable to associate the entries for physical, fast,
   interleaved channels, and higher layers (e.g., ATM) is shown below.
   Use of the ifStackTable is necessary because configuration
   information is stored in profile tables associated with the physical-
   layer ifEntry only.  The channels' ifEntrys need the ifStackTable to
   find their associated physical-layer entry and thus their
   configuration parameters.  The following example shows the
   ifStackTable entries for an xDSL line with a single channel that uses
   an ATM data path.


                       HigherLayer      LowerLayer
                       -----------------------------
                            0               ATM
                           ATM           XdslChannel
                        XdslChannel      XdslPhysical
                        XdslPhysical         0

   Channel


2.1.3.  Relationship with the ENTITY-MIB (RFC 4133)

   Implementation of the Entity MIB [RFC4133] is optional.  It in no way
   alters the information required in the VDSL2 Line MIB, nor does it
   alter the relationship with IF-MIB.

   The Entity MIB introduces a standardized way of presenting the
   components of complex systems, such as a Digital Subscriber Line
   Access Multiplexer (DSLAM), that may contain multiple racks, shelves,
   line cards, and/or ports.  The Entity MIB's main goal is to present
   these system components, their containment relationship, and mapping
   information with other MIBs such as the Interface MIB and the VDSL2
   Line MIB.

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                  August 2013


   The Entity MIB is capable of supporting the local DSL termination
   unit.  Thus, assuming the SNMP agent is in the DSLAM, the Entity MIB
   should include entities for the xTU-C in the entPhysicalTable.  The
   MIB's entAliasMappingTable would contain mapping information
   identifying the 'ifIndex' object associated with each xTU-C.  In case
   the SNMP agent is actually in the Customer Premise Equipment (CPE),
   the Entity MIB should include entities for the xTU-R in the
   entPhysicalTable.  In this case, the MIB's entAliasMappingTable would
   contain mapping information identifying the 'ifIndex' object
   associated with each xTU-R.

   Also associating the relationship between the ifTable and Entity MIB,
   the entPhysicalTable contains an 'entPhysicalName' object, which
   approximates the semantics of the 'ifName' object from the Interface
   MIB.

2.2.  IANA Considerations

   A new ifType value (251) for Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Loop
   Version 2 has been allocated for the VDSL2-LINE-MIB module, to
   distinguish between ADSL lines that are managed with the RFC 2662
   management model, ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ lines that are managed with
   the RFC 4706 [RFC4706] management model, and VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 and
   ADSL2+ lines that are managed with the model defined in this
   document.

   Also, the VDSL2-LINE-MIB module has been assigned a single object
   identifier (251) for its MODULE-IDENTITY.  The IANA has allocated
   this object identifier in the transmission subtree.

   As performed in the past for the ADSL2-LINE-MIB module, the IANA has
   ensured that the allocated ifType value is the same as the allocated
   branch number in the transmission subtree.

2.4.  Structure

   The MIB module is structured into the following MIB groups:

   o  Line Configuration, Maintenance, and Status Group:

      This group supports MIB objects for configuring parameters for the
      VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+ line and retrieving line status
      information.  It also supports MIB objects for configuring a
      requested power state or initiating a Dual Ended Loop Test (DELT)
      process in the VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+ line.  It contains the
      following tables:

      - xdsl2LineTable
      - xdsl2LineSegmentTable
      - xdsl2LineBandTable


   o  Channel Status Group:

      This group supports MIB objects for retrieving channel layer
      status information.  It contains the following table:

      - xdsl2ChannelStatusTable


   o  Subcarrier Status Group:

      This group supports MIB objects for retrieving the subcarrier
      layer status information, mostly collected by a Dual Ended Loop
      Test (DELT) process.  It contains the following tables:

      - xdsl2SCStatusTable
      - xdsl2SCStatusBandTable
      - xdsl2SCStatusSegmentTable

2.6.  Line Topology

   A VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ line consists of two units: atuc or
   vtuc (a central office termination unit) and atur or vtur (a remote
   termination unit).  There are up to 4 channels (maximum number of
   channels depends on the specific DSL technology), each carrying an
   independent information flow, as shown in the figure below.

2.7.  Counters, Interval Buckets, and Thresholds

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                  August 2013


2.7.1.  Counters Managed

   There are various types of counters specified in this MIB.  Each
   counter refers either to the whole VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ line, to
   one of the xTU entities, or to one of the bearer channels.


   o  On the whole line level

      For full initializations, failed full initializations, short
      initializations, and for failed short initializations, there are
      event counters, current 15-minute and 0 to 96 15-minute history
      bucket(s) of "interval-counters", as well as current and 0 to 30
      previous 1-day interval-counter(s).  Each current 15-minute
      "failed" event bucket has an associated threshold notification.


   o  On the xTU level

      For the LOS seconds, ES, SES, FEC seconds, and UAS, there are
      event counters, current 15-minute and 0 to 96 15-minute history
      bucket(s) of "interval-counters", as well as current and 0 to 30
      previous 1-day interval-counter(s).  Each current 15-minute event
      bucket has an associated threshold notification.


   o  On the bearer channel level

      For the coding violations (CRC anomalies) and corrected blocks
      (i.e., FEC events), there are event counters, current 15-minute
      and 0 to 96 15-minute history bucket(s) of "interval-counters", as
      well as current and 0 to 30 previous 1-day interval-counter(s).
      Each current 15-minute event bucket has an associated threshold
      notification.

2.7.2.  Minimum Number of Buckets

   Although it is possible to support up to 96 15-minute history buckets
   of "interval-counters", systems implementing this MIB module SHOULD
   practically support at least 16 buckets, as specified in ITU-T
   G.997.1, paragraph #7.2.7.9.

   Similarly, it is possible to support up to 30 previous 1-day
   "interval-counters", but systems implementing this MIB module SHOULD
   support at least 1 previous day bucket.

2.7.3.  Interval Buckets Initialization




Morgenstern, et al.     Expires February 02, 2014              [Page 21]

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                  August 2013


   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship
   between the start of a 15-minute interval and any wall clock;
   however, some implementations may align the 15-minute intervals with
   quarter hours.  Likewise, an implementation may choose to align 1-day
   intervals with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when an xTU is reinitialized, only when the
   agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside
   the scope of this MIB module).

2.7.4.  Interval Buckets Validity

   As in RFC 3593 [RFC3593] and RFC 2662 [RFC2662], in case the data for
   an interval is suspect or known to be invalid, the agent MUST report
   the interval as invalid.  If the current 15-minute event bucket is
   determined to be invalid, the element management system SHOULD ignore
   its content and the agent MUST NOT generate notifications based upon
   the value of the event bucket.

   A valid 15-minute event bucket SHOULD usually count the events for
   exactly 15 minutes.  Similarly, a valid 1-day event bucket SHOULD
   usually count the events for exactly 24 hours.  However, the
   following scenarios are exceptional:

   1) For implementations that align the 15-minute intervals with
      quarter hours and the 1-day intervals with start of a day, the
      management system may still start the PM process not aligned with
      the wall clock.  Such a management system may wish to retrieve
      even partial information for the first event buckets, rather than
      declaring them all as invalid.

   2) For an event bucket that suffered relatively short outages, the
      management system may wish to retrieve the available PM outcomes,
      rather than declaring the whole event bucket as invalid.  This is
      more important for 1-day event buckets.

   3) An event bucket may be shorter or longer than the formal duration
      if a clock adjustment was performed during the interval.

   This MIB module allows supporting the exceptional scenarios described
   above by reporting the actual Monitoring Time of a monitoring
   interval.  This parameter is relevant only for Valid intervals, but
   is useful for these exceptional scenarios:

   a) The management system MAY still declare a partial PM interval as
      Valid and report the actual number of seconds the interval lasted.

   b) If the interval was shortened or extended due to clock
      corrections, the management system SHOULD report the actual number
      of seconds the interval lasted, in addition to reporting that the
      interval is Valid.

2.8.  Profiles

   As a managed node can handle a large number of xTUs, (e.g., hundreds
   or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on every
   xTU may become burdensome.  Moreover, most lines are provisioned
   identically with the same set of parameters.  To simplify the
   provisioning process, this MIB module makes use of profiles and
   templates.

   A configuration profile is a set of parameters that can be shared by
   multiple entities.  In one implementation mode of this MIB (legacy
   management model) there are two types of configuration profiles: a
   configuration profile that addresses line-level
   provisioningparameters and another profile that addresses channel-
   level parameters.  The Vector of Profiles (VoP) management model, for
   reasons described later on in this document, breaks the set of
   configuration parameters into many more profile types, where each
   profile type is more homogenous, i.e., it contains parameters that
   share a common function (e.g., all the parameters that are required
   for provisioning the upstream power backoff feature).

   A configuration template in the legacy management model is actually a
   profile-of-profiles.  It is comprised of a single line configuration
   profile and one or more channel configuration profiles.  The template
   provides the complete configuration of a line and the same
   configuration can be shared by multiple lines if the management
   system associates them with the same configuration template.

   Similarly, the configuration VoP provides a complete configuration
   for a line.  However, in the VoP case sharing the same configuration
   with multiple lines depends on the specific mode of VoP attachement
   method, which is explained in the "Overview of the Vector of Profiles
   Management Model" chapter.

   In a similar manner to the configuration profiles and templates, this
   MIB module makes use of templates and profiles for specifying the
   alarm thresholds associated with performance parameters.  This allows
   provisioning multiple lines with the same criteria for generating
   threshold crossing notifications.  Note that alarm profiles and
   templates are being used also by Network Elements that use the VoP
   for configuring the line.

   The following paragraphs describe templates and profiles used in this
   MIB module.

2.8.1.  Configuration Profiles and Templates ( Legacy Method )


   o  Line Configuration Profiles - Line configuration profiles contain
      line-level parameters for configuring VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+
      lines.  They are defined in the xdsl2LineConfProfTable.

      The line configuration includes settings such as the specific
      VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+ modes to enable on the respective line,
      power spectrum parameters, rate adaptation criteria, and SNR
      margin-related parameters.  A subset of the line configuration
      parameters depends upon the specific xDSL Mode allowed (i.e., does
      the profile allow VDSL2, ADSL, ADSL2 and/or ADSL2+?) as well as
      what annex/annexes of the standard are allowed.  This is the
      reason a line profile MUST include one or more mode-specific
      extensions.


   o  Channel Configuration Profiles - Channel configuration profiles
      contain parameters for configuring bearer channels over the VDSL2/
      ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ lines.  They are sometimes considered as the
      service layer configuration of the VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+
      lines.  They are defined in the xdsl2ChConfProfTable.

      The channel configuration includes issues such as the desired
      minimum and maximum rate on each traffic flow direction and
      impulse noise protection parameters.


   o  Line Configuration Templates - Line configuration templates allow
      combining line configuration profiles and channel configuration
      profiles into a comprehensive configuration of the VDSL2/ADSL/
      ADSL2 and ADSL2+ line.  They are defined in the
      xdsl2LineConfTemplateTable.

      The line configuration template includes one index of a line
      configuration profile and one to four indices of channel
      configuration profiles.  The template also addresses the issue of
      distributing the excess available data rate on each traffic flow
      direction (i.e., the data rate left after each channel is
      allocated a data rate to satisfy its minimum requested data rate)
      among the various channels.

2.8.2.  Alarm Configuration Profiles and Templates


   o  Line Alarm Configuration Profiles - Line-level Alarm configuration
      profiles contain the threshold values for Performance Monitoring
      (PM) parameters, counted either on the whole line level or on an
      xTU level.  Thresholds are required only for failures and
      anomalies.  For example, there are thresholds for failed
      initializations and LOS seconds, but not for the aggregate number
      of full initializations.  These profiles are defined in the
      xdsl2LineAlarmConfProfileTable.


   o  Channel Alarm Configuration Profiles - Channel-level Alarm
      configuration profiles contain the threshold values for PM
      parameters counted on a bearer channel level.  Thresholds are
      defined for two types of anomalies: corrected blocks and coding
      violations.  These profiles are defined in the
      xdsl2ChAlarmConfProfileTable.


   o  Line Alarm Configuration Templates - Line Alarm configuration
      templates allow combining line-level alarm configuration profiles
      and channel-level alarm configuration profiles into a
      comprehensive configuration of the PM thresholds for the VDSL2/
      ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ line.  They are defined in the
      xdsl2LineAlarmConfTemplateTable.

      The line alarm configuration template includes one index of a
      line-level alarm configuration profile and one to four indices of
      channel-level alarm configuration profiles.

2.8.3.  Managing Profiles and Templates

   The index value for each profile and template is a locally unique,
   administratively assigned name having the textual convention
   'SnmpAdminString' (RFC 3411 [RFC3411]).

   In the legacy management model one or more lines may be configured to
   share parameters of a single configuration template (e.g.,
   xdsl2LConfTempTemplateName = 'silver') by setting its
   xdsl2LineConfTemplate object to the value of this template.  Sharing
   the same configuration with multiple lines in the Vector of Profiles
   (VoP) model depends on the specific mode of VoP attachement method,
   which is explained in the "Overview of the Vector of Profiles
   Management Model" chapter.





Morgenstern, et al.     Expires February 02, 2014              [Page 25]

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                  August 2013


   In both legacy management model and VoP model one or more lines may
   be configured to share parameters of a single alarm configuration
   template (e.g., xdsl2LAlarmConfTempTemplateName = 'silver') by
   setting its xdsl2LineAlarmConfTemplate object to the value of this
   template.

   In any case, before a template can be deleted or taken out of
   service, it MUST be first unreferenced from all associated lines.
   Implementations MAY also reject template modification while it is
   associated with any line.

   Similarly, before a profile can be deleted or taken out of service,
   it MUST be first unreferenced from all associated templates.
   Implementations MAY also reject profile modification while it is
   referenced by any template.

   Implementations MUST provide a default profile whose name is 'DEFVAL'
   for each profile and template type.  The values of the associated
   parameters will be vendor-specific unless otherwise indicated in this
   document.  Before a line's templates have been set, these templates
   will be automatically used by setting xdsl2LineConfTemplate and
   xdsl2LineAlarmConfTemplate to 'DEFVAL' where appropriate.  This
   default profile name, 'DEFVAL', is considered reserved in the context
   of profiles and templates defined in this MIB module.

   Profiles and templates are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically
   using the profile name and profile row status in each of the profile
   tables.

   If the implementation allows modifying a profile or template while it
   is associated with a line, then such changes MUST take effect
   immediately.  These changes MAY result in a restart (hard reset or
   soft restart) of the units on the line.

   Network Elements MAY optionally implement a fallback line
   configuration template (see xdsl2LineConfFallbackTemplate) or a
   fallback line configuration Vector of Profiles (VoP), in certain
   conditions.  The fallback template/VoP will be tried if the xDSL2
   line fails to operate using the primary template/VoP.  If the xDSL2
   line fails to operate using the fallback template/VoP, then the
   primary template should be retried.  The xTU-C SHOULD continue to
   alternate between the primary and fallback templates/VoPs until one
   of them succeeds.

2.8.4.  Managing Multiple Bearer Channels ( Legacy Method [only??] )

   The number of bearer channels is configured by setting the template
   objects xdsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile,



Morgenstern, et al.     Expires February 02, 2014              [Page 26]

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                  August 2013


   xdsl2LConfTempChan2ConfProfile, xdsl2LConfTempChan3ConfProfile, and
   xdsl2LConfTempChan4ConfProfile and then assigning that template to a
   DSL line using the xdsl2LineConfTemplate object.  When the number of
   bearer channels for a DSL line changes, the SNMP agent will
   automatically create or destroy rows in channel-related tables
   associated with that line.  For example, when a DSL line is operating
   with one bearer channel, there will be zero rows in channel-related
   tables for channels two, three, and four.  The SNMP agent MUST create
   and destroy channel-related rows as follows:


   o  When the number of bearer channels for a DSL line changes to a
      higher number, the SNMP agent will automatically create rows in
      the xdsl2ChannelStatusTable and xdsl2PMChCurrTable tables for that
      line.

   o  When the number of bearer channels for a DSL line changes to a
      lower number, the SNMP agent will automatically destroy rows in
      the xdsl2ChannelStatusTable,
      xdsl2PMChCurrTable,xdsl2PMChHist15MinTable, and
      xdsl2PMChHist1DTable tables for that line.

2.9.  Overview of the Vector of Profiles Management Model

   The Vector of Profiles management model provides an alternative to
   the legacy template management model.  The vector of profile
   management model provides a more efficient way to store
   configuration.  The vector of profiles management model is also more
   up to date because it contains configuration data that was defined in
   the most recent versions of ITU-T G.997.1.

   The template management model is not efficient in the way
   configuration data is stored.  In the template model, line level
   configuration data is stored in a line profile and channel level
   configuration data is stored in a channel profile.  It is quite
   common for two XDSL lines to require almost identical configuration
   data but having a slightly different value for one or two parameters.
   The template model will require two profiles to satisfy the
   requirements of the two XDSL lines and hence a large amount of data
   is duplicated in the two profiles.  The Vector of Profiles management
   model attempts to solve this problem of duplicated data by splitting
   the large line profile and large channel profiles into many smaller
   profiles.

   The vector that is defined in the Vector of Profiles management model
   is a management object that contains only pointers.  The vector
   contains pointers to the smaller profile objects mentioned in the
   paragraph above.  There are two methods that can be used to associate

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                  August 2013


   a vector with a XDSL line, the methods are called direct attachment
   method and indirect attachment method.

2.9.1.  The Direct Attachment Method

   For the direct attachment method, one vector object is automatically
   created for each XDSL line.  The SNMP agent creates the vector
   objects and hence the SNMP manager is not permitted to write to the
   Row Status attribute of the vector object.

   Each XDSL line is associated with one vector object because the
   vector object will have the same index as the XDSL line.

2.9.2.  The Indirect Attachment Method

   For the indirect attachment method, the SNMP manager is responsible
   for creating and deleting the vector objects using the Row Status
   attribute.  The SNMP manager then uses the xdsl2VopLineVectorId
   attribute to associate a XDSL line with a vector object.

   Initially, the SNMP agent will create one single vector object (
   called the default vector and having an index of 1 ) and all XDSL
   lines will refer to this vector.  The default vector cannot be
   deleted.

2.10.  Notifications

   The ability to generate the SNMP notifications coldStart/WarmStart
   (per [RFC3418]), which are per agent (e.g., per Digital Subscriber
   Line Access Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a device), and linkUp/
   linkDown (per [RFC2863]), which are per interface (i.e., VDSL2/ADSL/
   ADSL2 or ADSL2+ line) is required.

   A linkDown notification MAY be generated whenever any of ES, SES, CRC
   anomaly, LOS, LOF, or UAS events occur.  The corresponding linkUp
   notification MAY be sent when all link failure conditions are
   cleared.

   The notifications defined in this MIB module are for status change
   (e.g., initialization failure) and for the threshold crossings
   associated with the following events: full initialization failures,
   short initialization failures, ES, SES, LOS seconds, UAS, FEC
   seconds, FEC events, and CRC anomalies.  Each threshold has its own
   enable/threshold value.  When that value is 0, the notification is
   disabled.

   The xdsl2LineStatusXtur and xdsl2LineStatusXtuc are bitmasks
   representing all outstanding error conditions associated with the



Morgenstern, et al.     Expires February 02, 2014              [Page 28]

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                  August 2013


   xTU-R and xTU-C (respectively).  Note that since the xTU-R status is
   obtained via the EOC, this information may be unavailable in case the
   xTU-R is unreachable via EOC during a line error condition.
   Therefore, not all conditions may always be included in its current
   status.  Notifications corresponding to the bit fields in those two
   status objects are defined.

   Note that there are other status parameters that refer to the xTU-R
   (e.g., downstream line attenuation).  Those parameters also depend on
   the availability of EOC between the central office xTU and the remote
   xTU.

   A threshold notification occurs whenever the corresponding current
   15-minute interval error counter becomes equal to, or exceeds the
   threshold value.  Only one notification SHOULD be sent per interval
   per interface.  Since the current 15-minute counter is reset to 0
   every 15 minutes, and if the condition persists, the notification may
   recur as often as every 15 minutes.  For example, to get a
   notification whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at most once
   every 15 minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1.  The agent
   will generate a notification when the event originally occurs.

   Note that the Network Management System, or NMS, may receive a
   linkDown notification, as well, if enabled (via
   ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable [RFC2863]).  At the beginning of the next
   15-minute interval, the counter is reset.  When the first second goes
   by and the event occurs, the current interval bucket will be 1, which
   equals the threshold, and the notification will be sent again.

      DESCRIPTION
         "A set of attachment methods for attaching a vector to

          A vector is a row in the xdsl2VopVectorTable table.
          A vector is also a short way of saying a Vector of Profiles.

          The attachment methods are :
              direct    - One vector is automatically created for each
                          XDSL line. The SNMP agent is responsible for

   Xdsl2Band ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION
         "Identifies a band in a VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ link.
          For a band in the upstream direction, transmission is from the
          remote end (xTU-R) towards the central office end (xTU-C).
          For a band in the downstream direction, transmission is from
          the xTU-C towards the xTU-R.
          For ADSL, ADSL2 and ADSL2+, which use a single band in the
          upstream direction and a single band
          in the downstream direction,
          the only relevant values are upstream(1) and downstream(2).
          For VDSL2, which uses multiple bands in each transmission
          direction, a band in the upstream direction is indicated by
          any of us0(3), us1(5), us2(7), us3(9), or us4(11), and a band
          in the downstream direction is indicated by any of ds1(4),
          ds2(6), ds3(8), or ds4(10).
          For VDSL2, the values upstream(1) and downstream(2) may be
          used when there is a need to refer to the whole upstream or
          downstream traffic (e.g., report the average signal-to-noise
          ratio on any transmission direction).
          Specified as an INTEGER, the values are defined as
          follows:"

      DESCRIPTION
           "
            This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB)
            module for use with network management protocols in the
            Internet community for the purpose of managing VDSL2, ADSL,
            ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines.

            The MIB module described in RFC 2662 [RFC2662] defines
            objects used for managing Asymmetric Bit-Rate DSL (ADSL)
            interfaces per [T1E1.413], [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].
            These object descriptions are based upon the specifications
            for the ADSL Embedded Operations Channel (EOC) as defined
            in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) T1E1.413
            [T1E1.413] and International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T)
            G.992.1 [G.992.1] and G.992.2 [G.992.2].

            The MIB module described in RFC 4706 [RFC4706] defines
            objects used for managing ADSL2 interfaces per [G.992.3]
            and [G.992.4], and ADSL2+ interfaces per [G.992.5].
            That MIB is also capable of managing ADSL interfaces per
            [T1E1.413], [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].

            This document does not obsolete RFC 2662 [RFC2662] or
            RFC 4706 [RFC4706], but rather provides a more comprehensive
            management model that manages VDSL2 interfaces per G.993.2
            [G.993.2] as well as ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ technologies
            per T1E1.413, G.992.1, G.992.2, G.992.3, G.992.4, and
            G.992.5
            ([T1E1.413], [G.992.1], [G.992.2], [G.992.3], [G.992.4], and
            [G.992.5], respectively).

            Additionally, the management framework for VDSL2 lines
            specified by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum
            (DSLF) has been taken into consideration [TR-129].  That
            framework is based on the ITU-T G.997.1 standard [G.997.1]
            and its amendment 1 [G.997.1-Am1].

            The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2
            transmission, as discussed in the MIB-2 Integration
            (RFC 2863 [RFC2863]) section of this document.

          A request for a bits-per-subcarrier measurement is made by
          setting this object to the value of 'measure'.  Upon
          completion of the measurement request, the Access Node shall
          set this object to 'idle'.

          The SNMP agent should allow initiating a bits-per-subcarrier
          measurement process only if there is no other bits-per-
          subcarrier measurement already running, and respond with an
          SNMP error (e.g., wrongValue) otherwise.

          Note that a bits-per-subcarrier measurement is also performed
          during a line diagnostic procedure.  This object provides an
          additional mechanism to fetch the bits-per-subcarrier data.
          This additional mechanism is provided so that bits-per-
          subcarrier data may be fetched without forcing the line into
          no power state.
          This is useful because the bits-per-subcarrier allocation
          may be adjusted at show time due to rate adaption and bit
          swapping.

          The implementation of this additional mechanism for measuring
          bits per subcarrier is not mandatory.

         "Measurement request counter.
          This counter is incremented by one every time a request for a
          bits-per-subcarrier measurement is made.  A measurement
          request is made by modifying the xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc object
          from idle(1) to the value measure(2).

          The measurement results may be very large and will not fit
          into a single PDU; hence, multiple SNMP GET requests may be
          required to fetch the measurement results.
          Because the measurement results cannot be fetched atomically,
          it is possible for a second manager to start a new measurement
          before a first manager has fetched all of its results.
          An SNMP manager can use this object to ensure that the
          measurement results retrieved using one or more GET requests
          all belong to the measurement initiated by that manager.

          The following steps are suggested in order for the SNMP
          manager to initiate the bits-per-subcarrier measurement:

          1. Wait for xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc value to be idle(1).
          2. Perform an SNMP GET for xdsl2LineCmndConfBpscRequests.
          3. Wait a short delay (4 -> 8 seconds).
          4. Perform an SNMP SET on xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc with
             the value measure(2).
          5. If step 4 returns an error, then go to step 1.
          6. Wait for xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc value to be idle(1).

             xdsl2LineCmndConfBpscRequests.  If the value is one,

         "The table xdsl2LineSegmentTable contains status parameters
          of VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ subcarriers.
          The parameters in this table are updated when a measurement
          request is made using the xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc object.

          Note that a bits-per-subcarrier measurement is also performed
          during a line diagnostic procedure.  This table provides an
          additional mechanism to fetch the bits-per-subcarrier data.
          This additional mechanism is provided so that bits-per-
          subcarrier data may be fetched without forcing the line into
          no power state.
          This is useful because the bits-per-subcarrier allocation may
          be adjusted at Showtime due to rate adaption and bit swapping.

          The implementation of this additional mechanism for measuring
          bits per subcarrier is not mandatory."

         The xdsl2VopLSpectrumProfilesTable includes configuration

         mode(s) enabled by the XTSE configuration parameter (i.e.,
         xdsl2VopLSpectrumProfXtuTransSysEna). However, there are
         configuration parameters where their setup depends on a
         transmission mode. Therefore, each Line Spectrum Profile is also
         associated with one or more Mode Specific PSD Profiles. When
         the vector of profiles refers to a Line Spectrum Profile it also

         "The xdsl2VopModeSpecProfilesTable extends the
         xdsl2VopLSpectrumProfilesTable by mode-specifc configuration
         parameters, i.e., parameters that their setup depends on the
         specific transmission-mode used by the DSL line. The
         relationship between the tables is explained in the
         following paragraphs.

         The xdsl2VopLSpectrumProfilesTable includes Line Spectrum
         configuration parameters that are independent of the
         specific transmission-mode(s) enabled by the XTSE configuration
         parameter (i.e., xdsl2VopLSpectrumProfXtuTransSysEna). However,
         there are configuration parameters where their setup depends on
         a transmission-mode. Therefore, each Line Spectrum Profile is
         also associated with one or more Mode Specific PSD Profiles
         from this table (xdsl2VopModeSpecProfilesTable). When the
         vector of profiles (VoP) refers to a Line Spectrum Profile it
         also implicitly refers to all rows in
         xdsl2VopModeSpecProfilesTable that are associated with that
         Line Spectrum Profile.

         The association between each row in the Line Spectrum Profiles
         table and one or more rows in this table, is performed by, a
         third table, xdsl2VopModeSpecMapTable.

         The xdsl2VopModeSpecProfilesTable is a stand-alone dynamic
         table and basically rows can always be added to it. Similarly,
         rows can be removed from the table by the SNMP manager, as
         long as they are not referenced by any row in the
         xdsl2VopModeSpecMapTable.

         In particular, this table should always include profile
         number 1 serving for the default setup of rows in
         xdsl2VopModeSpecMapTable.

         Entries in this table MUST be maintained in a persistent

          parameter defines
          the subset of downstream PSD mask breakpoints, as specified in
          xdsl2LConfProfPsdMaskDs (PSDMASKds), that shall be used to notch
          an RFI band.  This subset consists of pairs of consecutive

          corresponding to the low level of the notch.
          The specific interpolation around these points is defined in the
          relevant Recommendations (e.g., ITU-T Recommendation G.992.5).
          The CO-MIB shall define the RFI notches using breakpoints in
          xdsl2LConfProfPsdMaskDs (PSDMASKds) as specified in the relevant
          Recommendations (e.g., ITU-T Recommendation G.992.5).

          For ITU-T Recommendation G.993.2, this configuration parameter
          defines the bands where the PSD shall be reduced as

4.  Implementation Analysis

   A management application intended to manage ADSL links (e.g.,
   G.992.1) with this MIB module MUST be modified to adapt itself to
   certain differences between RFC 2662 [RFC2662] and this MIB module,
   including the following aspects:


   o  Though the configuration templates/profiles allow referring to 1-4
      bearer channels, ADSL links are limited to two channels at most.

   o  Though the channel configuration profile allows higher data rates,
      ADSL links are limited to downstream/upstream data rate as assumed
      in RFC 2662 [RFC2662].

   o  The Impulse Noise Protection (INP) configuration parameters are
      given by minimum protection and maximum delay parameters.

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                  August 2013


   o  The line configuration profile includes a sub-table that addresses
      mode-specific parameters.  For ADSL links, the management
      application SHOULD create a row in that table for the ADSL modes
      only.

   o  The line configuration profile includes parameters that are
      irrelevant for ADSL links.  Similarly, many status parameters in
      the MIB are irrelevant for certain ADSL modes.  Therefore, it is
      advised to consult with ITU G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] regarding
      the scope and relevance of each parameter in this MIB.


5.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:


   o  xdsl2LineTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:


      *  xdsl2LineConfTemplate

      *  xdsl2LineConfFallbackTemplate

      *  xdsl2LineAlarmConfTemplate

      *  xdsl2LineCmndConfPmsf

      *  xdsl2LineCmndConfLdsf

      *  xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc

      *  xdsl2LineCmndAutomodeColdStart

      *  xdsl2LineCmndConfReset

      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineConfTemplate could have a major
      adverse operational effect on many lines simultaneously.

Internet-Draft               VDSL2-LINE MIB                  August 2013


      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineConfFallbackTemplate could have a
      major adverse operational effect on many lines simultaneously.

      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineAlarmConfTemplate could have a
      contrary effect on notifications.

      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineCmndConfPmsf could have an
      adverse affect on the power consumption of a line and may disrupt
      an operational service.

      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineCmndConfLdsf could cause an
      unscheduled line test to be carried out on the line.

      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc could cause an
      unscheduled bits-per-subcarrier measurement to be carried out on
      the line.

      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineCmndAutomodeColdStart could cause
      an unscheduled cold reset to the line.

      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineCmndConfReset could cause a
      unscheduled retrain of a line.


   o  xdsl2LineSegmentTable

      This table contains one object, xdsl2LineSegmentRowStatus, that
      supports SET operations.  Unauthorized changes could result in
      measurement results being deleted prematurely.


   o  xdsl2SCStatusTable

      This table contains one object, xdsl2SCStatusRowStatus, that
      supports SET operations.  Unauthorized changes could result in
      line test results being deleted prematurely.


   o  xdsl2LineConfTemplateTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:


      *  xdsl2LConfTempLineProfile

      *  xdsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile

      xdsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile, xdsl2LConfTempChan2ConfProfile,
      xdsl2LConfTempChan3ConfProfile, or xdsl2LConfTempChan4ConfProfile
      could have an adverse operational effect on several lines; could
      change several lines over to running in unwanted levels of
      operation; or could result in several services undergoing changes
      in the number of channels that carry the service.

      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LConfTempChan1RaRatioDs,
      xdsl2LConfTempChan2RaRatioDs, xdsl2LConfTempChan3RaRatioDs, or
      xdsl2LConfTempChan4RaRatioDs would alter the relative rate
      allocations among all channels belonging to a line.  This could
      have an adverse operational effect on several lines.

      Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LConfTempRowStatus could result in
      templates being created or brought into service prematurely, or
      they could result in templates being inadvertently deleted or
      taken out of service.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:


   o  xdsl2LineInventoryTable

      Access to these objects would allow an intruder to obtain
      information about which vendor's equipment is in use on the
      network.  Further, such information is considered sensitive in
      many environments for competitive reasons.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using IPsec),

   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], Section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   It is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic
   security.  It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure
   that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module
   is properly configured to give access only to those objects whose
   principals (users) have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
