This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing Synchronous Optical
Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) interfaces.  This
document is a companion to the documents that define Managed Objects
for the DS1/E1/DS2/E2 and DS3/E3 Interface Types.

This memo replaces RFC 2558.  Changes relative to RFC 2558 are
summarized in the MIB module's REVISION clause.

This document is a product of the AToM MIB Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Draft Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
