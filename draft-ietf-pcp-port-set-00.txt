1.  Introduction

   This section describes a few (and non-exhaustive) envisioned use
   cases.  Note that the PCP extension defined in this document is
   generic and is expected to be applicable to other use cases.

1.1.  Lightweight 4over6

   In the Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite]
   architecture, shared global addresses can be allocated to customers.
   It allows moving the Network Address Translation (NAT) function,
   otherwise accomplished by a Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN)
   [I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements], to the Customer-Premises
   Equipment (CPE).  This provides more control over the NAT function to
   the user, and more scalability to the ISP.

   In the lw4o6 architecture, the PCP-controlled device corresponds to
   the lwAFTR, and the PCP client corresponds to the lwB4.  The client

Internet-Draft                PCP PORT_SET                    March 2013


   sends a PCP MAP request containing a PORT_SET option to trigger
   shared address allocation on the lwAFTR.  The PCP response contains
   the shared address information, including the port set allocated to
   the lwB4.

1.2.  Applications Using Port Sets

   Some applications require not just one port, but a port set.  One
   example is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent Server
   (UAS) [RFC3261] expecting to handle multiple concurrent calls,
   including media termination.  When it receives a call, it needs to
   signal media port numbers to its peer.  Generating individual PCP MAP
   requests for each of the media ports during call setup would
   introduce unwanted latency.  Instead, the server can pre-allocate a
   set of ports such that no PCP exchange is needed during call setup.

   Using PORT_SET, an application can manipulate port sets much more
   efficiently than with individual MAP requests.

1.3.  Firewall Control

   Port sets are often used in firewall rules.  For example, defining a
   range for RTP [RFC3550] traffic is common practice.  The MAP request
   can already be used for firewall control.  The PORT_SET option brings
   the additional ability to manipulate firewall rules operating on port
   sets instead of single ports.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  The need for PORT_SET

   Multiple MAP requests can be used to manipulate a set of ports,
   having roughly the same effect as a single use of a MAP request with
   a PORT_SET option.  However, use of the PORT_SET option is more
   efficient when considering the following aspects:

   Network Traffic:  A single request uses less network resources than
      multiple requests.

   Latency:  Even though MAP requests can be sent in parallel, we can
      expect the total processing time to be longer for multiple
      requests than a single one.

Internet-Draft                PCP PORT_SET                    March 2013


   Client-side simplicity:  The logic that is necessary for maintaining
      a set of ports using a single port set entity is much simpler than
      that required for maintaining individual ports, especially when
      considering failures, retransmissions, lifetime expiration, and
      re-allocations.

   Server-side efficiency:  Some PCP-controlled devices can allocate
      port sets in a manner such that data passing through the device is
      processed much more efficiently than the equivalent using
      individual port allocations.  For example, a CGN having a "bulk"
      port allocation scheme (see [I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements]
      section 5) often has this property.

   Server-side scalability:  The number of mapping entries in PCP-
      controlled devices is often a limiting factor.  Allocating port
      sets in a single request can result in a single mapping entry
      being used, therefore allowing greater scalability.

   Therefore, while it is functionally possible to obtain the same
   results using plain MAP, the extension proposed in this document
   allows greater efficiency, scalability, and simplicity, while
   lowering latency and necessary network traffic.  In a nutshell,
   PORT_SET is a necessary optimization.

   In addition, PORT_SET supports parity preservation.  Some protocols
   (e.g.  RTP [RFC3550]) assign meaning to a port number's parity.  When
   mapping sets of ports for the purpose of using such kind of protocol,
   preserving parity can be necessary.

4.  The PORT_SET Option

   Option Name:  PORT_SET

   Number:  TBD

   Purpose:  To map sets of ports.

   Valid for Opcodes:  MAP

   Length:  2 bytes

   May appear in:  Both requests and responses

   Maximum occurrences:  1

      NOTE TO IANA (to be removed prior to publication as an RFC): The
      number is to be assigned by IANA in the range 1-63 (i.e.,
      mandatory to process and created via Standards Action).

   The PORT_SET Option indicates that the client wishes to reserve a set
   of ports.  The requested number of ports in that set is indicated in
   the option.

   The PORT_SET Option is formatted as shown in Figure 1.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Option Code=? |  Reserved   |P|    Option Length=2            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |        Port Set Size          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                         Figure 1: PORT_SET Option

   The fields are as follows:

   P: 1 if parity preservation is requested, 0 otherwise.

   Port Set Size:  Number of ports requested.  MUST NOT be zero nor one.

      NOTE: In its current form, PORT_SET does not support allocating
      discontinuous port sets.  That feature could be added in the
      future depending on input from the working group.

   The Internal Port Set is defined as being the range of Port Set Size
   ports starting from the Internal Port.  The External Port Set is
   respectively defined as being the range of Port Set Size ports
   starting from the Assigned External Port.  The two ranges always have
   the same size (i.e., the Port Set Size returned by the server).

4.1.  Client Behavior

   To retrieve a set of ports, the PCP client adds a PORT_SET option to
   its PCP MAP request.  If port preservation is required, the PCP
   Client MUST set the parity bit (to 1) to ask the server to preserve
   the port parity (i.e., the Assigned External Port and Internal Port
   have the same parity).  The PCP client MUST indicate a suggested Port
   Set Size.  A non-null value MUST be used.

   The PCP Client MUST NOT include more than one PORT_SET option in a
   MAP request.  If several port sets are needed, the PCP client MUST
   issue as many MAP requests each of them include a PORT_SET option.
   These individual MAP request MUST include distinct Internal Port.

   If the PORT_SET option is not supported by the server, the PCP client
   will have to issue individual MAP requests with no PORT_SET option.

4.2.  Server Behavior

   In addition to regular MAP request processing, the following checks
   are made upon receipt of a PORT_SET option with non-zero Requested
   Lifetime:

   o  If multiple PORT_SET options are present in a single MAP request,
      a MALFORMED_OPTION error is returned.

   o  If the Port Set Size is zero or one, a MALFORMED_OPTION error is
      returned.

   If the PREFER_FAILURE option is present and the server is unable to
   map all ports in the requested External Port Set or is unable to
   preserve parity (P = 1), the CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL error is
   returned.

   If the PREFER_FAILURE option is absent, the server MAY map fewer
   ports than the value of Port Set Size from the request.  It MUST NOT
   map more ports than the client asked for.  In any case, the Internal
   Port Set MUST always begin from the Internal Port indicated by the
   client.  In particular, if the port mapping failed either because of
   the unavailability of ports, the PCP Server SHOULD reserve only one
   external port (i.e., the PCP server ignores the PORT_SET option).  If
   the server ends up mapping only a single port, for any reason, the
   PORT_SET option MUST NOT be present in the response.

   If the PREFER_FAILURE option is absent and port parity preservation
   is requested (P = 1), the server MAY preserve port parity.  In that
   case, the External Port is set to a value having the same parity as
   the Internal Port.

   If a mapping already exists and the PORT_SET option can be honored,
   the PCP server updates the mapping with port set information and
   sends back a positive answer to the requesting PCP client.

   If the mapping is successful, the MAP response's Assigned External
   Port is set to the first port in the External Port Set, and the
   PORT_SET option's Port Set Size is set to number of ports in the
   mapped port set.

4.3.  Port Set Renewal and Deletion

   Port set mappings are renewed and deleted as a single entity.  That
   is, the lifetime of all port mappings in the set is set to the
   Assigned Lifetime at once.

Internet-Draft                PCP PORT_SET                    March 2013


   The PORT_SET option MUST be present in a renewal or deletion request.
   If a server receives a MAP request without a PORT_SET option and
   whose Internal Port is inside a mapped Internal Port Set, it replies
   with a MALFORMED_REQUEST error.

5.  Operational Considerations

   It is totally up to the PCP server to determine the port-set quota
   for each PCP client.  In addition, when the PCP-controlled device
   supports multiple port-sets delegation for a given PCP client, the
   PCP client MAY re-initiate a PCP request to get another port set when
   it has exhausted all the ports within the port-set.

   If the PCP server is configured to allocate multiple port-set
   allocation for one subscriber, the same Assigned External IP Address
   SHOULD be assigned to one subscriber in multiple port-set requests.

   To optimize the number of mapping entries maintained by the PCP
   server, it is RECOMMENDED to configure the server to assign the
   maximum allowed port set in a single response.  This policy SHOULD be
   configurable.

   The failover mechanism in MAP [section 14 in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]] and
   [I-D.boucadair-pcp-failure] can also be applied to port sets.

6.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that no additional security considerations beyond
   those discussed in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] apply to this extension.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA shall allocate a code in the range 1-63 for the new PCP option
   defined in Section 4.
