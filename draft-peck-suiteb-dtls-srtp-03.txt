1. Introduction

   This document specifies the conventions for using NSA Suite B
   Cryptography [SuiteB] with the Datagram Transport Layer Security
   (DTLS) protocol, the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP), and
   the Secure Real-time Transport Control Protocol (SRTCP) to provide a
   robust architecture for securing real-time data.

   The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) provides
   confidentiality and message authentication to RTP traffic.  The
   Secure Real-time Transport Control Protocol (SRTCP) provides message
   authentication and optional confidentiality to the Real-time
   Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3711].  SRTP and SRTCP depend
   upon external key management to provide secret master keys from which
   to form encryption and authentication keys.  RTP and RTCP are usually
   run over the User Datagram Protocol, UDP.

   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), based upon the Transport
   Layer Security protocol (TLS), provides communication security for
   datagram protocols such as UDP [RFC6347].  DTLS-SRTP is an extension
   for DTLS that provides key management to SRTP and SRTCP as well as a
   choice of algorithms and parameters for the SRTP and SRTCP sessions
   [RFC5764].

   [RFC6460] describes a Suite B profile for TLS and DTLS.  This
   document builds upon RFC 6460, adding additional components to
   provide a Suite B profile for DTLS-SRTP.

1.1 Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Suite B Requirements

   Suite B requires that key establishment and signature algorithms be
   based upon Elliptic Curve Cryptography and that the encryption
   algorithm be AES [FIPS197].  Suite B algorithms are defined to
   support two minimum levels of security: 128 and 192 bits.  Suite B
   includes [SuiteB]:


   Encryption            Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) (key sizes
                         of 128 and 256 bits)

   Digital Signature     Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
                         (ECDSA) [FIPS186-3] (using the curves with 256-

                         and 384-bit prime moduli as specified in FIPS
                         PUB 186-3)

   Key Agreement         Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
                         [SP800-56A] (using the curves with 256- and
                         384-bit prime moduli as specified in FIPS PUB
                         186-3)

   Secure Hash           SHA-256 and SHA-384 [FIPS180-4]

   The curves with 256- and 384-bit prime moduli are described in NIST
   FIPS 186-3 [FIPS186-3].  They are referred to as P-256 and P-384,
   respectively.  These elliptic curves appear in the literature under
   two different names.  For sake of clarity, we list both names below:

       Curve       NIST name      SECG name
       ------------------------------------
       P-256       nistp256       secp256r1
       P-384       nistp384       secp384r1


3. Minimum Security Levels for Suite B Compliant Implementations

   Suite B provides for two levels of cryptographic security, namely a
   128-bit minimum level of security (minLOS_128) and a 192-bit minimum
   level of security (minLOS_192).  Each level defines a minimum
   strength that all cryptographic algorithms must provide.  We divide
   the Suite B non-signature primitives into two columns as shown in
   Table 1.

                              Column 1            Column 2
                         +-------------------+------------------+
      Encryption         |    AES-128        |    AES-256       |
                         +-------------------+------------------+
      Key Agreement      |    ECDH on P-256  |    ECDH on P-384 |
                         +-------------------+------------------+
      Hash for PRF/MAC   |    SHA-256        |    SHA-384       |
                         +-------------------+------------------+

                             Table 1: Suite B Cryptographic
                               Non-Signature Primitives



   At the 128-bit minimum level of security the non-signature primitives
   MUST either come exclusively from Column 1 or exclusively from Column
   2.

Internet Draft       draft-peck-suiteb-dtls-srtp-03        June 21, 2013


   At the 192-bit minimum level of security the non-signature primitives
   MUST come exclusively from Column 2.


3.1. DTLS Cryptographic Suites for minLOS_128 and minLOS_192

   Each system MUST specify a security level of a minimum of 128 bits or
   192 bits.  The security level determines which suites from the Suite
   B compliant profile of [RFC6460] are allowed.

   The two Suite B combinations, "SuiteB_Combination_1" or
   "SuiteB_Combination_2" from section 3.1 of [RFC6460], satisfy the
   requirements of section 3 of this document for the DTLS connection.

   For a system to implement the Suite B compliant DLTS-SRTP profile, it
   MUST follow the requirements of [RFC6460] for the DTLS connection.
   The cipher suite rules from section 4 of [RFC6460] are summarized
   here:

      o A Suite B compliant DTLS MUST use version 1.2 or higher.

      o A system configured at a minimum level of security of 128 bits
        MUST use either TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 or
        TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, with
        TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 being the preferred
        choice.

      o If configured at a minimum level of security of 192 bits, the
        system MUST use TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.

      o The choice of curve used in the ECDH key exchange MUST agree
        with the requirements listed in Table 1 of section 3.


3.2. Suite B DTLS Authentication

   Digital signatures using ECDSA MUST be used for authentication by
   Suite B compliant implementations.  Using the notation of [RFC6460],
   "ECDSA-256" represents an instantiation of the ECDSA algorithm using
   the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash function. "ECDSA-384" represents
   an instantiation of the ECDSA algorithm using the P-384 curve and the
   SHA-384 hash function.

   When running in Suite B compliant mode, a system configured at a
   minimum level of security of 128 bits MUST use either ECDSA-256 or
   ECDSA-384 for client and server authentication.  It is allowable for
   one party to authenticate with ECDSA-256 and the other party to
   authenticate with ECDSA-384.  This flexibility will allow
 


Peck and Igoe                Informational                      [Page 5]

Internet Draft       draft-peck-suiteb-dtls-srtp-03        June 21, 2013


   interoperability between a client and a server that have different
   sizes of ECDSA authentication keys.

   In Suite B compliant mode, clients and servers in a system configured
   at a minimum level of security of 128 bits MUST be able to verify
   ECDSA-256 signatures and SHOULD be able to verify ECDSA-384
   signatures unless it is absolutely certain that the implementation
   will never need to verify certificates from an authority which uses
   an ECDSA-384 signing key.

   A system compliant with the Suite B profile and configured at a
   minimum level of security of 192 bits MUST use ECDSA-384 for both
   client and server DTLS authentication.

   Clients and servers in a system configured at a minimum level of
   security of 192 bits MUST be able to verify ECDSA-384 signatures.

   When in Suite B compliant mode, authentication methods other than
   ECDSA-256 and ECDSA-384 MUST NOT be used for DTLS authentication.  If
   a relying party receives a message signed with any other
   authentication method, it MUST return a DTLS error and stop the DTLS
   handshake.

   Mutual authentication MUST be performed by client and server
   [RFC5764].


3.3. Digital Signatures and Certificates

   The initiator and responder, at both minimum levels of security, MUST
   each have an X.509 certificate that complies with the end entity
   signature certificate format defined in section 4.5.3 of "Suite B
   Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC5759].


4. Client and Server Handshake to Create DTLS Premaster Secret

   DTLS-SRTP is defined for point-to-point media sessions, in which
   there are exactly two participants [RFC5764].  Two DTLS peers MUST
   follow the guidelines in [RFC6460] in order to be Suite B compliant. 
   Two peers who wish to implement the Suite B DTLS-SRTP profile MUST
   implement DTLS 1.2 or later.

   The peers MUST each generate an ephemeral elliptic curve key pair for
   key agreement using either the P-256 or P-384 curve.  The curve
   chosen will depend upon the selected cipher suite, following the
   requirements of section 3.  The peers will then execute the elliptic
   curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement to obtain a DTLS premaster

Internet Draft       draft-peck-suiteb-dtls-srtp-03        June 21, 2013


   secret [SP800-56A, section 6.1.2.2]).

   The DTLS premaster secret will be 32 bytes in length when using the
   P-256 curve and 48 bytes in length when using the P-384 curve.

   Two Suite B DTLS-SRTP compliant peers MUST each have an X.509
   certificate that complies with the Suite B end entity digital
   signature certificate profile [RFC5759].  The peer acting as the DTLS
   server will use his key and the ECDSA algorithm to sign the DTLS
   server key exchange message.  For DTLS-SRTP implementations
   [RFC5764], the peer acting as server will send the CertificateRequest
   message.  The peer acting as the client MUST then use his key and the
   ECDSA algorithm to sign the CertificateVerify message.

   Peers compliant with Suite B for DTLS-SRTP MUST follow the
   certificate guidance in section 4.3 of [RFC6460].


5. DTLS Master Secret

   For Suite B applications using DTLS 1.2 or later versions, the PRF
   used to compute the DTLS master secret will be:

      When selecting the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 cipher
      suite, the TLS PRF with SHA-256 as the hash function MUST be used
      as in [RFC5246].

      When selecting the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 cipher
      suite, the TLS PRF with SHA-384 as the hash function MUST be used
      as in [RFC5246].

   The master secret will be 48 bytes in length for both PRFs.


6. SRTP Master Key and Master Salt

   The DTLS master key is used in DTLS-SRTP to create SRTP master key
   and salt pairs for the two peers acting as client and server via the
   TLS exporter [RFC5764].  In particular, the PRF used to compute each
   SRTP master key and salt is the following:

      o When the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 cipher suite is
        chosen, the TLS PRF with SHA-256 as the hash function MUST be
        used.  The SRTP master keys exported for the client and server
        MUST be 128 bits in size.  The SRTP master salt values for the
        client and server MUST be 112 bits.

      o When the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 cipher suite is

Internet Draft       draft-peck-suiteb-dtls-srtp-03        June 21, 2013


        chosen, the TLS PRF with SHA-384 as the hash function MUST be
        used.  The SRTP master keys exported for the client and server
        MUST be 256 bits in size.  The SRTP master salt values for the
        client and server MUST be 112 bits.


7. Suite B SRTP Protection Profiles

   For Suite B applications, AES in Galois Counter Mode, AES-GCM, MUST
   be used to protect SRTP and SRTCP packets.  Note that encryption is
   OPTIONAL but message authentication is MANDATORY for SRTCP packets
   [RFC3711].  Section 14.2 of [srtp-gcm] defines the DTLS-SRTP "SRTP
   Protection Profiles" used for Suite B.

   The following AES_128 based SRTP protection profiles are applicable
   when using the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 cipher suite
   for DTLS:

         AEAD_AES_128_GCM_8
         AEAD_AES_128_GCM_12

   The following AES_256 based SRTP protection profiles are applicable
   when using the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 cipher suite
   for DTLS:

         AEAD_AES_256_GCM_8
         AEAD_AES_256_GCM_12

   Any Suite B compliant DTLS-SRTP application MUST use one of the
   above, no other encryption or integrity algorithms are allowed.  In
   addition, the following constraints are imposed upon on any Suite B
   compliant DTLS-SRTP applications:

      o Any application running at the 192-bit minimum level of security
        MUST support AEAD_AES_256_GCM_8 and SHOULD support
        AEAD_AES_256_GCM_12.  The AES_128 based profiles MUST NOT be
        used.

      o For applications running at the 128-bit minimum level of
        security, there are three options:

         o Option 1 (AES_128 based): The application MUST support
           AEAD_AES_128_GCM_8 and and SHOULD support
           AEAD_AES_128_GCM_12.

         o Option 2 (AES_256 based): The application MUST support
           AEAD_AES_256_GCM_8 and and SHOULD support
           AEAD_AES_256_GCM_12.
 


Peck and Igoe                Informational                      [Page 8]

Internet Draft       draft-peck-suiteb-dtls-srtp-03        June 21, 2013


         o Option 3 (both AES_128 and AES_256): The application MUST
           support both AEAD_AES_128_GCM_8 and AEAD_AES_256_GCM_8 and
           SHOULD support AEAD_AES_128_GCM_12 and AEAD_AES_256_GCM_12.

         o Since the AES_128 based profiles are the preferred choice at
           the 128-bit minimum level of security, if Option 3 is used
           the AES_128 based profiles MUST be offered before the AES_256
           based profiles.


8. DTLS Cipher Suite and SRTP Protection Profile Negotiation

   As described in [RFC5764], the DTLS-SRTP peer acting as the client
   signals its acceptable SRTP protection profiles to the DTLS-SRTP peer
   acting as the server with the "use_srtp" DTLS extension.  For Suite
   B, the client determines its acceptable SRTP protection profiles
   based on its offered TLS cipher suites.

      o If the client offers TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
        then the client MUST offer AEAD_AES_128_GCM_8 and MAY offer
        AEAD_AES_128_GCM_12.

      o If the client offers TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
        then the client MUST offer AEAD_AES_256_GCM_8 and MAY offer
        AEAD_AES_256_GCM_12.

   The client MAY offer other cipher suites or protection profiles, but
   if used, the connection will not be Suite B compliant.

   For Suite B, the DTLS-SRTP peer acting as the server chooses the DTLS
   cipher suite from the client's offerings and also chooses the SRTP
   protection profile from the client's offerings.

      o If the server chooses TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
        then it MUST choose AEAD_AES_128_GCM_8 or AEAD_AES_128_GCM_12.

      o If the server chooses TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
        then it MUST choose AEAD_AES_256_GCM_8 or AEAD_AES_256_GCM_12.

   The server MAY choose other cipher suites or protection profiles, but
   if used, the connection will not be Suite B compliant.  The client
   and server each have the option to terminate the connection if the
   chosen cipher suite and protection profile are not acceptable.


9. SRTP/SRTCP Key Derivation

   The AES Counter Mode based key derivation function is used to derive
 


Peck and Igoe                Informational                      [Page 9]

Internet Draft       draft-peck-suiteb-dtls-srtp-03        June 21, 2013


   session keys and salts for SRTP/SRTCP [RFC3711].  The session keys
   and salts MUST have the following bit sizes:

      When using the AEAD_AES_128_GCM_8 or AEAD_AES_128_GCM_12
      protection profile:
