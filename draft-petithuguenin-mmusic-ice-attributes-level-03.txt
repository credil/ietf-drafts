Internet-Draft         Media level ICE attributes             March 2012


1.  Introduction

   ICE [RFC5245] defines the ice-options SDP attribute as session-level
   only attribute, but when ICE is used with disaggregated media (see
   section 3 of [I-D.loreto-splices-disaggregated-media]), there is a
   possibility that different media use different ICE implementations
   and/or different networks, and so these different media will require
   different values for this attribute.

   As an example, the ice-options attribute value "rtp+ecn" (defined in
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-ecn-for-rtp]) signals ECN capability.  Two
   aggregated media using two different RTP implementations may want to
   use different values for this attribute.

   Note that there is a similar problem for the ice-lite attribute but
   unfortunately it does not seem possible to design a way to use the
   ice-lite attribute at the media level that is compatible with legacy
   implementations that recognize only the session-level attribute.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  The ice-options Attribute

   The ice-options attribute is redefined by this document as a session-
   level and media-level attribute.

   All future new ICE options MUST also define how media-level ICE
   options using this new value are aggregated to eventually generate
   the value of the session-level ICE option, so legacy implementations
   that only recognize session-level ICE options can interoperate with
   implementations that recognize ICE options at both levels.

   Before applying this specific aggregation rule, the session-level
   ice-options attribute MUST be copied as media-level attribute in each
   media.


4.  The ice-lite Attribute

   The ice-lite attribute is not redefined by this specification.

5.  The ice-mismatch Attribute

   [RFC5245] section 15.3 defines this attribute as been media level,
   which seems correct.  But section 21.1.4 registered this attribute in
   IANA as session level.  Because it is more likely that the error in
   in the registration, this document considers the attribute to be
   defined at the media level.  An errata [1] has been filled to fix
   this error.


6.  Specific Aggregation Rule for the rtp+ecn ICE Option

   If all aggregated media using ICE contain a media-level "rtp+ecn" ICE
   option, as defined by [I-D.ietf-avtcore-ecn-for-rtp], then an "rtp+
   ecn" ICE option MUST be inserted at the session-level.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not add any security considerations beyond what is
   discussed in [RFC5245].


8.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA considerations.

Appendix A.  Examples

A.1.  Aggregating media all supporting ICE

   In this example, we have two SDP to aggregate.  The first SDP
   contains an ice-options attribute at the media level:

   media-level attribute.  The first SDP is modified like this:

   After aggregation, all the individual media keep their media-level
   ice-options attribute, and a session-level ice-options attribute is
   added as per the rule in Section 3:

A.2.  Aggregating media partially supporting ICE

   In this example, we have two SDP to aggregate, but the second one
   does not use ICE.  The first SDP contains an ice-options attribute at
   the media level:

   media-level attribute.  Only the first SDP is modified in this
   example:

Appendix B.  Analysis of similar issues in other attributes

   In the MMUSIC WG session in Quebec City, it was suggested that the
   problem was perhaps larger than just ICE attributes.  This section is
   the result of a systematic look at all the session level only SDP
   attributes registered by IANA at the date of this document.  The
   conclusion is that only the ICE attributes are of concern but that
   steps should be taken to ensure that these problems cannot happen for
   future new attributes.

B.1.  The type:broadcast Attribute

   The "type:broadcast" does not have any issue by itself, but it should
   be noted that it implies a default attribute of recvonly, so the
   disaggregation process must take this in account.

B.2.  The charset Attribute

   Because the main reason to use a different charset for a session
   description is to generate a more compact representation, it is
   probably OK that this attribute exists only at the session level.
   But the aggregation/disaggregation rules must explicitly convert the
   individual media descriptions to and from the common charset, ISO-
   10646.

B.3.  The tool Attribute

   The definition of this attribute make it clear that this attribute
   contains the name and version number of the tool that created the

   session description as a whole.  But it probably would be useful to
   define this attribute at the media level too, so we can know the
   tools used for create the individual media descriptions.

B.4.  The ipbcp, bcastversion, 3GPP-Integrity-Key, 3GPP-SDP-Auth, alt-
      group, PSCid, bc_service, bc_program and bc_service_package
      Attributes

   These attributes were not defined in IETF Standard Track documents,
   so the analysis is left to the SDOs that produced this
   specifications.


Appendix C.  Release notes

   This section must be removed before publication as an RFC.

C.1.  Modifications between -03 and -02

   o  Added reference to errata.

C.2.  Modifications between -02 and -01

   o  Added reference to RFC 5245 in the abstract (idnits).
   o  Changed author affiliation.
   o  Added analysis of all IANA registered session level only
      attributes.
   o  Added sections for ice-lite and ice-mismatch.

C.3.  Modifications between -01 and -00

   o  Changed the rtp+ecn aggregation rule so that non-ICE media are not
      used when aggregating.
   o  Filled Security and IANA sections.
   o  Added examples of aggregation.
   o  Added a design note about using different attribute name at media
      level.

C.4.  Design Notes

   o  It has been proposed multiple times to use a different attribute
      name for the ice-options attribute when used at the media-level.
      Using a different name does not solve the aggregation problem and,
      in the opinion of this author, could create confusion.
