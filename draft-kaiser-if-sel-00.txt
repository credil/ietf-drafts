    Interface Selection Mechanism for Multiple Interfaces IPv6 Hosts
                         draft-kaiser-if-sel-00

Abstract

   This document describes an interface selection mechanism that enables
   multiple interfaces (multihomed) IPv6 hosts to select their most
   appropriate egress interface to send data over the network.  The
   mechanism extends the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol [RFC4861] with
   two new Router Advertisement options.

1.  Introduction

   In the context of multihomed hosts, where hosts are connected to a
   network with more than only one interface, the selection of a right
   egress interface to send data is critical.  Indeed, selecting a wrong
   egress interface may lead to a non-optimal routing of data in the
   network or, in the worst case, the impossibility to reach the
   destination.  In order to cope with the aforementioned issue, this
   document describes an interface selection mechanism that enables
   hosts to select their most appropriate egress interface, leading to
   an optimized end-to-end routing of data.

   The proposed mechanism is based on the ND protocol.  More precisely,
   two new options are introduced in RS and RA messages: the Link Cost
   Option (LCO) and the Path Cost Option (PCO).

3.  Description of the mechanism

   The proposed mechanism is divided into two operations, each one
   relying on a new ND option:

   o  Gathering informations about links costs and selection of a
      default egress interface using the Link Cost Option

   o  Gathering informations about the cost of a path to a destination
      and selection of an egress interface for the specific destination
      using the Path Cost Option (PCO)

   The following subsections detail each operation as well as the
   corresponding option.

3.1.  Link Cost Option

   The LCO is used to advertise the cost of a link.  This option MUST be
   included in all RA messages that are generated by routers.
   Therefore, a host that connects to a link is informed about the cost
   of this specific link.  By extension, if a host is connected to
   multiple links in the network, it is informed about the cost of each
   of those links.  Using these informations, the host selects its
   default interface: the interface connected to the link that has the
   lowest cost is selected.  The host then adds in its routing table an
   entry that contains the default route as destination, the router that
   is on the corresponding link as next-hop, the selected interface as
   outgoing interface and the link cost as metric.  Upon reception of
   other RA messages, the host compares the link costs included in the
   RAs with the one in its routing table.  If the received link cost is
   better than the one of the default route in the routing table, the
   latter MUST be updated accordingly.

   The following figure shows the format of the link cost option.  This
   option is only valid in the RA messages and MUST NOT be included in
   the other ND messages.

   Type:           Identifier of the LCO (TBD by IANA).

   Length:         1.  Size of the option as defined in [RFC4861].

   Reserved:       Unused field.  MUST be set to zero by sender and
                   ignored by recipient.

   Link Cost:      Unsigned integer.  The cost of the link.

3.2.  Path Cost Option

   The PCO is used by hosts to ask routers about the total cost of a
   path to a destination.  The routers reply to the request also by
   using the PCO.  Thus, this option MAY be included in RS and RA
   messages.

   When a multiple interfaces host wants to send data to a destination
   node, it starts by checking in its routing table if a specific route
   to this destination exists.  If no route exists, the host sends a RS
   message with a PCO to the all-routers multicast address on each of
   its interfaces.  The PCO includes the IPv6 address of the destination
   to which the host wants to send data.  Upon reception of such RS
   message, a router checks in its routing table which route entry it
   would select to forward data to this specific destination.  The
   router then replies by sending a unicast RA message to the requesting
   host with a PCO that includes the total cost of the selected path
   from the router itself to the destination along with a lifetime that
   defines the validity of the route advertised.  Upon reception of
   these informations, the host computes the total cost of the path from
   itself to the destination by adding to the path cost advertised by
   the router the corresponding link cost (which is advertised with the
   LCO).  Once computed, the host selects as egress interface to the
   specific destination the interface connected to the path that has the
   lowest end-to-end cost.  The host then updates its routing table
   accordingly with the new computed information.

   The following figure shows the format of the path cost option.  This
   option is only valid in the RS or RA messages and MUST NOT be
   included in the other ND messages.

4.  Status Code

   A Status Code is included in the PCO option.  It provides additionnal
   informations to the host about the results of its request.  The
   following codes are considered:

   0    Success: a path to the destination is known by the router and
        the corresponding path cost is included in the PCO.

   1    No specific route to the destination is known by the router.
        However, the router has a default route that can be used to
        forward data to the destination, but with no warranty.  In this
        case, the corresponding path cost MUST be set to the maximum
        possible value (i.e. all-ones bits).

   2    Failure: the packets to this destination would probably be
        dropped by this router because no route to reach the destination
        is known or because of any other reason (firewall rules, policy-
        related rules, ...).  In this case, the path cost value is set
        to zero.

5.  Example use case

   Typical uses cases that can be considered are home networks,
   corporate network, ad-hoc networks, etc.  This section illustrates
   the mechanism through a simple network topology.

   The figure shows two routers (Router1, Router2) and two hosts (Host1,
   Host2).  Theses nodes are connected to each other through 4 links
   (Link1, Link2, Link3, Link4).  The values in brackets represent the
   corresponding link costs.  Also, Host1 is a multiple interfaces
   device: it is connected to Link3 via its network interface I1 and to
   link4 via its network interface I2.

   Let us consider Host1.  Its first operation consists of gathering
   links costs and select a default interface.  To this end, Router1 and
   Router2 send usual periodic RA messages.  These messages include a
   LCO that describes the cost of the link: Router1 advertises that the
   cost of Link3 is 5 and Router2 advertises that the cost of link4 is
   3.  As Link4 has a better cost that Link3, Host1 selects I2 as its
   default interface.  Host1 then updates its routing table accordingly,
   as show in the following figure:

   +---------------------+------------------+------------------+------+

   Let us now consider that Host1 wants to communicate with Host2.  In a
   classical scenario, Host1 would send data for Host2 through I2,
   according to its routing table.  Data would thus be forwarded by
   Router2 and Router1 through Link1 and Link2 respectively, leading to
   a total path cost of 9.  Sending data through I1 would have been a
   better choice.  Indeed, despite the fact that Link3 has a worse cost
   compared to Link4, the end-to-end path cost would be better (7).
   However, as Host1 is not a router, it does not have a sufficient
   vision of the network to make such decision.  To this end, before
   sending data to Host2, Host1 first send a RS message that includes a
   PCO on all its outgoing interfaces (I1 and I2).  The "Destination
   Address" field is filled with tha address of Host2.  Upon reception
   of such message, the routers reply to Host1 with a PCO included in RA
   message: Router1 replies that its better known path to reach Host2
   has a total cost of 2 (Link2) and Router2 replies that its better
   known path has a total cost of 6 (Link1 + Link2).  As Host1 already
   knows the costs of Link3 and Link4, it computes that sending data
   through I1 would have an end-to-end cost of 7 (Link3 + Link2) whereas
   using I2 would lead to an end-to-end cost of 9 (Link4 + Link1 +
   Link2).  Hence, Host1 selects I1 as its egress interface to reach
   Host2 and updates accordingly its routing table, as shown in the
   following figure:

5.2.  Messages exchange diagram

   The following diagram shows the messages exchanges corresponding to
   the example described above: the first two RA messages correspond to
   Host1 default interface selection, the following two RS/RA messages
   exchanges correspond to the selection of Host1 interface to reach
   Host2 and the lasts messages show the final path used by data to
   transit from Host1 to Host2 and vice-versa.
