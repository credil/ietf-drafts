RFC 2658 specifies the streaming format for 3GPP2 13K vocoder (High
Rate Speech Service Option 17 for Wideband Spread Spectrum
Communications Systems, also known as QCELP 13K vocoder) data, but
does not specify a storage format.  Many implementations have been
using the "QCP" file format (named for its file extension) for
exchanging QCELP 13K data as well as Enhanced Variable Rate Coder
(EVRC) and Selectable Mode Vocoders (SMV) data.  (For example,
Eudora(r), QuickTime(r), and cmda2000(r) handsets).

This document specifies the QCP file format and updates the
audio/qcelp media registration to specify this format for storage, and
registers the audio/evrc-qcp and audio/smv-qcp media types for EVRC
and SMV (respectively) data stored in this format.
