    <abstract>
      <t>NAT444 is an IPv4 extension technology being considered by Service
      Providers to continue offering IPv4 service to customers while
      transitioning to IPv6. This technology adds an extra Carrier-Grade NAT
      ("CGN") in the Service Provider network, often resulting in two NATs.
      CableLabs, Time Warner Cable, and Rogers Communications independently
      tested the impacts of NAT444 on many popular Internet services using a
      variety of test scenarios, network topologies, and vendor equipment.
      This document identifies areas where adding a second layer of NAT
      disrupts the communication channel for common Internet applications.
      This document was updated to also include Dual-Stack Lite impacts.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IANA and APNIC exhausted their IPv4 address space in 2011. Current
      projections suggest that RIPE and ARIN may exhaust their free pools of
      IPv4 addresses in 2012. IPv6 is the solution to the IPv4 depletion
      problem; however, the transition to IPv6 will not be completed prior to
      IPv4 exhaustion. NAT444 <xref target="I-D.shirasaki-nat444"></xref> and
      Dual-Stack Lite (<xref target="RFC6333"></xref>) are transition
      mechanisms that will allow Service Providers to multiplex customers
      behind a single IPv4 address, which will allow many legacy devices and
      applications some IPv4 connectivity. While both NAT444 and Dual-Stack
      Lite do provide basic IPv4 connectivity, they impact a number of
      advanced applications. This document describes suboptimal behaviors of
      NAT444 and DS-Lite in our test environments.</t>

      <t>In July-August 2010, CableLabs, Time Warner Cable, and Rogers
      Communications tested the impact of NAT444 on common applications using
      Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) devices. This testing was focused on a wide
      array of real time usage scenarios designed to evaluate the user
      experience over the public Internet using NAT444, in both single ISP and
      dual ISP environments. The purpose of this testing was to identify
      applications where the technology either breaks or significantly impacts
      the user experience. The outcome of the testing revealed that
      applications such as video streaming, video gaming and peer-to-peer file
      sharing are impacted by NAT444.</t>

      <t>From June &ndash; October 2011, CableLabs conducted additional
      testing of CGN technologies, including both NAT444 and Dual-Stack Lite.
      The testing focused on working with several vendors including A10,
      Alcatel-Lucent, and Juniper to optimize the performance of those
      applications that experienced negative impacts during earlier CGN
      testing and to expand the testing to DS-Lite.</t>

      <t>Applications that were tested included but were not necessarily
      limited to the following:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Video/Audio streaming, e.g. Silverlight-based applications,
          Netflix, YouTube, Pandora 2.</t>

          <t>Peer-to-peer applications, e.g. video gaming, uTorrent</t>

          <t>On line gaming, e.g. Xbox</t>

          <t>Large file transfers using File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</t>

          <t>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) calls via X-Lite, Skype</t>

          <t>Social Networking, e.g. Facebook, Webkinz</t>

          <t>Video chat, e.g. Skype</t>

          <t>Web conferencing</t>

          <t>This test case is similar to Case 1 but with the addition of
          another identical ISP. This topology allows us to test traffic
          between two residential customers connected across the Internet. We
          focused on client-to-client applications such as IM and
          peer-to-peer.</t>

      <section title="General Test Environment">
        <t>The lab environment was intended to emulate multiple service
        provider networks with a CGN deployed, and with connectivity to the
        public IPv4 or IPv6 internet (as dictated by the co-existence
        technology under test). This was accomplished by configuring a CGN
        behind multiple CMTSes and setting up multiple home networks for each
        ISP. Testing involved sending traffic to and from the public internet
        in both single and dual ISP environments, using both single and
        multiple home networks. The following equipment was used for
        testing:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>CGN</t>

            <t>CMTS</t>

            <t>IP sniffer</t>

            <t>RF sniffer</t>

            <t>Metrics tools (for network performance)</t>

            <t>CPE gateway devices</t>

            <t>Laptop or desktop computers (multiple OS used)</t>

            <t>Gaming consoles</t>

            <t>iPad or tablet devices</t>

            <t>other CE equipment, e.g. BluRay players supporting
            miscellaneous applications</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>One or more CPE gateway devices were configured in the home
        network. One or more host devices behind the gateways were also
        configured in order to test conditions such as multiple users on
        multiple home networks in the CGN architecture, both in single and
        dual ISP environments.</t>

        <t>The scope of testing was honed down to the specific types of
        applications and network conditions that demonstrated a high
        probability of diminishing user experience based on prior testing. The
        following use cases were tested:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Video streaming over Netflix</t>

            <t>Video streaming over YouTube</t>

            <t>On line gaming with Xbox (one user)</t>

            <t>Peer to Peer gaming with Xbox (two users)</t>

            <t>Bit Torrent/uTorrent file seeding/leeching</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Test Metrics">
        <t>Metrics data that were collected during the course of testing were
        related to throughput, latency, and jitter. These metrics were
        evaluated under three conditions:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Initial finding on the CGN configuration used for testing</t>

            <t>Retest of the same test scenario with the CGN removed from the
            network</t>

            <t>Retest with a new configuration (optimized) on the CGN (when
            possible)</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In our testing, we found no significant differences with respect to
        latency or jitter when the CGN was in the network versus when it was
        not present in the network. It should be noted that we did not conduct
        any performance testing and metrics gathered were limited to single
        session scenarios. Also, bandwidth was not restricted on the DOCSIS
        network. Simulated homes shared a single DOCSIS upstream and
        downstream channel.</t>

        <t>Note: Performance testing as defined by CableLabs includes load
        testing, induction of impairments on the network, etc. This type of
        testing was out of scope for CGN testing.</t>

      <section title="Test Scenarios Executed">
        <t>The following test scenarios were executed using the aforementioned

      <section title="General Test Methodologies">
        <t>The CGN was configured for optimal setting for the specific test
        being executed for NAT444 or DS-Lite. Individual vendors provided
        validation of the configuration used for the co-existence technology
        under test prior to the start of testing. Some NAT444 testing used
        private <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> IPv4 space between the CGN and
        CPE router; other tests used public (non-<xref
        target="RFC1918"></xref>) IPv4 space between the CGN and CPE router.
        With the exception of 6to4 (<xref target="RFC3056"></xref>) traffic,
        we observed no difference in test results whether private or public
        address space was used. 6to4 failed when public space was used between
        the CGN and CPE router was public, but CPE routers did not initiate
        6to4 when private space was used.</t>

        <t>CPE gateways and client devices were configured with IPv4 or IPv6
        addresses using DHCP or manual configuration as required by each of
        the devices used in the test.</t>

        <t>All devices were brought to operational state. Connectivity of CPE
        devices to provider network and public Internet were verified prior to
        start of each test.</t>

        <t>IP sniffers and metrics tools were configured as required before
        starting tests. IP capture and metrics data was collected for all
        failed test scenarios. Sniffing was configured behind the home
        routers, north and south of the CMTS, and north and south of the
        CGN.</t>

        <t>The test technician executed test scenarios listed above, for
        single and dual ISP environments, testing multiple users on multiple
        home networks, using the applications described above, where
        applicable to the each specific test scenario. Results checklists were
        compiled for all tests executed and for each combination of devices
        tested.</t>

    <section title="Observed CGN Impacts">
      <t>CGN testing revealed that basic services such as e-mail and web
      browsing worked normally and as expected. However, there were some
      service affecting issues noted for applications that fall into two
      categories; dropped service and degraded service. In addition, for some
      specific applications in which the performance was degraded, throughput,
      latency and jitter measurements were taken. We observed that performance
      often differs from vendor to vendor and from test environment to test
      environment, and the results are somewhat difficult to predict. So as to
      not become a comparison between different vendor implementations, these
      results are presented in summary form. When issues were identified, we
      worked with the vendors involved to confirm the specific issues and
      explore workarounds. Except where noted, impacts to NAT444 and DS-Lite
      were similar.</t>

      <t>In 2010 testing, we identified that IPv6 transition technologies such
      as 6to4 <xref target="RFC3056"></xref> and Teredo <xref
      target="RFC4380"></xref>) fail outright or are subject to severe service
      degradation. We did not repeat transition technology testing in
      2011.</t>

      <section title="Dropped Services">
        <t>Several peer-to-peer applications failed in both the NAT444 and
        Dual-Stack Lite environments. Specifically, peer-to-peer gaming using
        Xbox, and peer-to-peer SIP calls using the PJSIP client did not
        succeed. Many CGN devices use "full cone" NAT so that once the CGN
        maps a port for outbound services, it will accept incoming connections
        to that port. However, some applications did not first send outgoing
        traffic and hence did not open an incoming port through the CGN. Other
        applications try to open a particular fixed port through the CGN;
        while service will work for a single subscriber behind the CGN, it
        fails when multiple subscribers try to use that port.</t>

        <t>PJSIP and other SIP software worked when clients used a
        registration server to initiate calls, provided that the client inside
        the CGN initiated the traffic first and that only one SIP user was
        active behind a single IPv4 address at any given time. However, in our
        testing, we observed that when making a direct client-to-client SIP
        call across two home networks on a single ISP, or when calling from a
        single home network across dual ISPs, calls could neither be initiated
        nor received.</t>

        <t>In the case of peer-to-peer gaming between two Xbox 360 users in
        different home networks on the same ISP, the game could not be
        connected between the two users. Both users shared an outside IP
        address, and tried to connect to the same port, causing a connection
        failure. There are some interesting nuances to this problem. In the
        case where two users are in the same home network and the scenario is
        through a single ISP, when the Xbox tries to register with the Xbox
        server, the server sees that both Xboxes are coming through the same
        public IP address and directs the devices to connect using their
        internal IP addresses. So, the connection ultimately gets established
        directly between both Xboxes via the home gateway, rather than the
        Xbox server. In the case where there are two Xbox users on two
        different home networks using a single ISP, and the CGN is configured
        with only one public IPv4 address, this scenario will not work because
        the route between the two users cannot be determined. However, if the
        CGN is configured with two public NAT IP addresses this scenario will
        work because now there is a unique IP address to communicate with.
        This is not an ideal solution, however, because it means that there is
        a one-to-one relationship between IP addresses in the public NAT and
        the number of Xbox users on each network.</t>

        <t>Other peer-to-peer applications that were noted to fail were
        seeding sessions initiated on Bittorent and uTorrent. In our test,
        torrent seeding was initiated on a client inside the CGN. Leeching was
        initiated using a client on the public Internet. It was observed that
        direct peer-to-peer seeding did not work. However, the torrent session
        typically redirected the leeching client to a proxy server, in which
        case the torrent session was set up successfully. Additionally, with
        the proxy in the network, re-seeding via additional leech clients
        worked as would be expected for a typical torrent session. Finally,
        uTorrent tries to use STUN to identify its outside address. In working
        with vendors, we learned that increasing the STUN timeout to 4 minutes
        improved uTorrent seeding performance behind a CGN, resulting in the
        ability for the uTorrent client to open a port and successfully seed
        content.</t>

      <section title="Degraded Services">
        <t>There were several applications that diminished the user experience
        in our environment. We measured these variations in user experience
        against a baseline IPv4 environment where NAT is not deployed.
        Specifically, large size file transfers and multiple video streaming
        sessions initiated on a single client on the same home network proved
        to be problematic with some home routers behind the CGN.</t>

        <t>In our testing, we tried large file transfers from several FTP
        sites, as well as downloading sizable audio and video files (750MB
        &ndash; 1.4 GB) from the Internet Archive. We observed that when
        Dual-Stack Lite was implemented for some specific home router and
        client combinations, the transfer rate was markedly slower. For
        example, PC1 using one operating system behind the same home router as
        PC2 using a different operating system yielded a transfer rate of
        120Kbps for PC1, versus 250Kbps for PC2. Our conclusion is that
        varying combinations of home routers and CE client devices may result
        in a user experience that is less than what the user would expect for
        typical applications. It is also difficult to predict which
        combinations of CPE routers and CE devices will produce a reduced
        experience for the user. We did not analyze the root cause of the
        divergence in performance across CE devices, as this was beyond the
        scope of our testing. However, as this issue was specific to
        Dual-Stack Lite, we suspect that it is related to the MTU.</t>

        <t>While video streaming sessions for a single user generally
        performed well, testing revealed that video streaming sessions such as
        Microsoft Smooth Streaming technology (i.e. Silverlight) or Netflix
        might also exhibit some service impacting behavior. In particular,
        this was observed on one older, yet popular and well-known CPE router
        where the first session was severely degraded when a second session
        was initiated in the same home network. Traffic from the first session
        ceased for 8 s once the second session was initiated. While we are
        tempted to write this off as a problematic home router, its popularity
        suggests that home router interactions may cause issues in NAT444
        deployments (newer routers that support DS-Lite were not observed to
        experience this condition). Overall, longer buffering times for video
        sessions were noted for most client devices behind all types of home
        routers. However, once the initial buffering was complete, the video
        streams were consistently smooth. In addition, there were varying
        degrees as to how well multiple video sessions were displayed on
        various client devices across the CPE routers tested. Some video
        playback devices performed better than others.</t>

      <section title="Improvements since 2010">
        <t>Since CableLabs completed initial CGN testing in 2010, there have
        been quantifiable improvements in performance over CGN since that
        time. These improvements may be categorized as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Content provider updates</t>

            <t>Application updates</t>

            <t>Improvements on the CGNs themselves</t>
          </list>In terms of content provider updates, we have noted
        improvements in the overall performance of streaming applications in
        the CGN environment. Whereas applications such as streaming video were
        very problematic a year ago with regard to jitter and latency, our
        most recent testing revealed that there is less of an issue with these
        conditions, except in some cases when multiple video streaming
        sessions were initiated on the same client using specific types of
        home routers. Applications such as MS Smooth Streaming appear to have
        addressed these issues to some degree.</t>

        <t>As far as application updates, use of STUN and/or proxy servers to
        offset some of the limitations of NAT and tunneling in the network are
        more evident as workarounds to the peer-to-peer issues. Applications
        appear to have incorporated other mechanisms for delivering content
        faster, even if buffering times are somewhat slower and the content is
        not rendered as quickly.</t>

        <t>CGN vendors have also upgraded their devices to mitigate several
        known issues with specific applications. With regard to addressing
        peer-to-peer SIP call applications, port reservations appear to be a
        workaround to the problem. However, this approach has limitations
        because of there are limited numbers of users that can have port
        reservations at any given time. For example, one CGN implementation
        allowed a port reservation to be made on port 5060 (default SIP port)
        but this was the only port that could be configured for the SIP
        client. This means that only one user can be granted the port
        reservation.</t>

      <section title="Additional CGN Challenges">
        <t>There are other challenges that arise when using shared IPv4
        address space, as with NAT444. Some of these challenges include: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Loss of geolocation information - Often, translation zones will
            cross traditional geographic boundaries. Since the source
            addresses of packets traversing an LSN are set to the external
            address of the LSN, it is difficult for external entities to
            associate IP/Port information to specific locations/areas.</t>

            <t>Lawful Intercept/Abuse Response - Due to the nature of NAT444
            address sharing, it will be hard to determine the
            customer/endpoint responsible for initiating a specific IPv4 flow
            based on source IP address alone. Content providers, service
            providers, and law enforcement agencies will need to use new
            mechanisms (e.g., logging source port and timestamp in addition to
            source IP address) to potentially mitigate this new problem. This
            may impact the timely response to various identification requests.
            See <xref target="RFC6269"></xref></t>

            <t>Antispoofing - Multiplexing users behind a single IP address
            can lead to situations where traffic from that address triggers
            antispoofing/DDoS protection mechanisms, resulting in
            unintentional loss of connectivity for some users.</t>
