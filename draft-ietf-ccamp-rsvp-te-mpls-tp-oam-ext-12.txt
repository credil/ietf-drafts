1.  Introduction

   This document describes the configuration of pro-active MPLS-TP
   (MPLS-Transport Profile) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
   (OAM) Functions for a given LSP using TLVs using GMPLS RSVP-TE
   [RFC3473].  The use of GMPLS RSVP-TE for the configuration of OAM

   functions is defined in a technology agnostic way in [OAM-CONF-FWK].
   This document specifies the additional mechanisms necessary to
   establish MPLS-TP OAM entities at the maintenance points for
   monitoring and performing measurements on an LSP, as well as defining
   information elements and procedures to configure pro-active MPLS-TP
   OAM functions running between LERs.  Initialization and control of
   on-demand MPLS-TP OAM functions are expected to be carried out by
   directly accessing network nodes via a management interface; hence
   configuration and control of on-demand OAM functions are out-of-scope
   for this document.

   MPLS-TP, the Transport Profile of MPLS, must, by definition
   [RFC5654], be capable of operating without a control plane.
   Therefore, there are several options for configuring MPLS-TP OAM,
   without a control plane by either using an NMS or LSP Ping, or with a
   control plane using signaling protocols such as RSVP-TE.

   Pro-active MPLS-TP OAM is performed by four different protocols, Bi-
   directional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC6428] for Continuity Check
   /Connectivity Verification, the delay measurement protocol (DM)
   [RFC6374] for delay and delay variation (jitter) measurements, and
   the loss measurement protocol (LM) [RFC6374] for packet loss and
   throughput measurements.  Additionally there is a number of Fault
   Management Signals that can be configured.

   BFD is a protocol that provides low-overhead, fast detection of
   failures in the path between two forwarding engines, including the
   interfaces, data link(s), and to the extent possible the forwarding
   engines themselves.  BFD can be used to track the liveliness and
   detect data plane failures of MPLS-TP point-to-point and might also
   be extended to support point-to-multipoint connections.

   The delay and loss measurements protocols [RFC6374] use a simple
   query/response model for performing bidirectional measurements that
   allows the originating node to measure packet loss and delay in both
   directions.  By timestamping and/or writing current packet counters
   to the measurement packets at four times (Tx and Rx in both
   directions) current delays and packet losses can be calculated.  By
   performing successive delay measurements the delay variation (jitter)
   can be calculated.  Current throughput can be calculated from the
   packet loss measurements by dividing the number of packets sent/
   received with the time it took to perform the measurement, given by
   the timestamp in LM header.  Combined with a packet generator the
   throughput measurement can be used to measure the maximum capacity of
   a particular LSP.  It should be noted that here we are not
   configuring on-demand throughput estimates based on saturating the
   connection as defined in [RFC6371].  Rather, we only enable the
   estimation of the current throughput based on loss measurements.

   MPLS-TP describes a profile of MPLS that enables operational models
   typical in transport networks, while providing additional OAM,
   survivability and other maintenance functions not currently supported
   by MPLS.  [RFC5860] defines the requirements for the OAM
   functionality of MPLS-TP.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Overview of MPLS OAM for Transport Applications

   [RFC6371] describes how MPLS-TP OAM mechanisms are operated to meet
   transport requirements outlined in [RFC5860].

   [RFC6428] specifies two BFD operation modes: 1) "CC mode", which uses
   periodic BFD message exchanges with symmetric timer settings,
   supporting Continuity Check, 2) "CV/CC mode" which sends unique
   maintenance entity identifiers in the periodic BFD messages
   supporting Connectivity Verification as well as Continuity Check.

   [RFC6374] specifies mechanisms for performance monitoring of LSPs, in
   particular it specifies loss and delay measurement OAM functions.

   [RFC6427] specifies fault management signals with which a server LSP
   can notify client LSPs about various fault conditions to suppress
   alarms or to be used as triggers for actions in the client LSPs.  The
   following signals are defined: Alarm Indication Signal (AIS), Link
   Down Indication (LDI) and Lock Report (LKR).

   [RFC6371] describes the mapping of fault conditions to consequent
   actions.  Some of these mappings may be configured by the operator,
   depending on the application of the LSP.  The following defects are
   identified: Loss Of Continuity (LOC), Misconnectivity, MEP
   Misconfiguration and Period Misconfiguration.  Out of these defect
   conditions, the following consequent actions may be configurable: 1)
   whether or not the LOC defect should result in blocking the outgoing
   data traffic; 2) whether or not the "Period Misconfiguration defect"
   should result in a signal fail condition.

3.  Theory of Operations

3.1.  MPLS-TP OAM Configuration Operation Overview

   GMPLS RSVP-TE, or alternatively LSP Ping [LSP-PING-CONF], can be used
   to simply enable the different OAM functions, by setting the
   corresponding flags in the "OAM Function Flags sub-TLV" [OAM-CONF-
   FWK].  For a more detailed configuration one may include sub-TLVs for
   the different OAM functions in order to specify various parameters in
   detail.

   Typically intermediate nodes should not process or modify any of the
   OAM configuration TLVs but simply forward them to the end-node.
   There is one exception to this and that is if the "MPLS OAM FMS sub-
   TLV" is present.  This sub-TLV has to be examined even by
   intermediate nodes, but only acted upon by nodes capable of
   transmitting FMS signals into the LSP being established.  The sub-TLV
   MAY be present the FMS flag is set in the "OAM Function Flags sub-
   TLV".  If this sub-TLV is present the "OAM MIP entities desired" and
   "OAM MEP entities desired" flags (described in [OAM-CONF-FWK]) in the
   "LSP Attributes Flags TLV" MUST be set and the entire OAM
   Configuration TLV placed either in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object
   or in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object ensure that capable intermediate
   nodes process the configuration.  If placed in LSP_ATTRIBUTES nodes
   that are not able to process the OAM Configuration TLV will forward
   the message without generating an error, this is not the case if
   placed in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object.

   Finally, if the "MPLS OAM FMS sub-TLV" is not included only the "OAM
   MEP entities desired" flag is set and the OAM Configuration TLV may
   be placed in either LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES.

3.1.1.  Configuration of BFD sessions

   For this specification, BFD MUST be run in either one of the two
   modes:

      - Asynchronous mode, where both sides should be in active mode



Bellagamba, et al.      Expires December 22, 2013               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Extensions for MPLS-TP OAM Conf           June 2013


      - Unidirectional mode

   In the simplest scenario, RSVP-TE, or alternatively LSP Ping [LSP-
   PING-CONF], is used only to bootstrap a BFD session for an LSP,
   without any timer negotiation.

   Timer negotiation can be performed either in subsequent BFD control
   messages (in this case the operation is similar to LSP Ping based
   bootstrapping described in [RFC5884]) or directly in the RSVP-TE
   signaling messages.

   When BFD Control packets are transported in the G-ACh they are not
   protected by any end-to-end checksum, only lower-layers are providing
   error detection/correction.  A single bit error, e.g. a flipped bit
   in the BFD State field could cause the receiving end to wrongly
   conclude that the link is down and in turn trigger protection
   switching.  To prevent this from happening the "BFD Configuration
   sub-TLV" has an Integrity flag that when set enables BFD
   Authentication using Keyed SHA1 with an empty key (all 0s) [RFC5880].
   This would ensure that every BFD Control packet carries an SHA1 hash
   of itself that can be used to detect errors.

   If BFD Authentication using a pre-shared key / password is desired
   (i.e. authentication and not only error detection), the "BFD
   Authentication sub-TLV" MUST be included in the "BFD Configuration
   sub-TLV".  The "BFD Authentication sub-TLV" is used to specify which
   authentication method should be used and which pre-shared key /
   password should be used for this particular session.  How the key
   exchange is performed is out of scope of this document.

3.1.2.  Configuration of Performance Monitoring

   It is possible to configure Performance Monitoring functionalities
   such as Loss, Delay, Delay variation (jitter), and Throughput as
   described in [RFC6374].

   When configuring Performance monitoring functionalities it is
   possible to choose either the default configuration, by only setting
   the respective flags in the "OAM Function Flags sub-TLV", or a
   customized configuration.  To customize the configuration, one would
   set the respective flags and including the respective Loss and/or
   Delay sub-TLVs).

   By setting the PM/Loss flag in the "OAM Function Flags sub-TLV" and
   by including the "MPLS OAM PM Loss sub-TLV", one can configure the
   measurement interval and loss threshold values for triggering
   protection.

   Delay measurements are configured by setting PM/Delay flag in the
   "OAM Function Flags sub-TLV", and by including the "MPLS OAM PM Loss
   sub-TLV", one can configure the measurement interval and the delay
   threshold values for triggering protection.

3.1.3.  Configuration of Fault Management Signals

   To configure Fault Management Signals and their refresh time, the FMS
   flag in the "OAM Function Flags sub-TLV" MUST be set and the "MPLS
   OAM FMS sub-TLV" included.  When configuring Fault Management
   Signals, two options are possible, default configuration is enabled
   by setting the respective flags in the "OAM Function Flags sub-TLV",
   the default settings MAY be customized by including the "MPLS OAM FMS
   sub-TLV".

   If an intermediate point is intended to originate fault management
   signal messages, this means that such an intermediate point is
   associated to a server MEP through a co-located MPLS-TP client/server
   adaptation function.  Such a server MEP needs to be configured by its
   own RSVP-TE session (or, alternatively, via an NMS or LSP-ping).
   However, by setting the "Fault Management subscription" flag in the
   "MPLS OAM FMS sub-TLV", a client LSP can indicate that it would like
   an association to be created to the server MEP(s) on any intermediate
   nodes.

3.2.  MPLS OAM Configuration sub-TLV

   The "OAM Configuration TLV", defined in [OAM-CONF-FWK], specifies the
   OAM functions that are used for the LSP.  This document extends the
   "OAM Configuration TLV" by defining a new OAM Type: "MPLS OAM"
   (suggested value 2, IANA to assign) from the "RSVP-TE OAM
   Configuration Registry".  The "MPLS OAM" type is set to request the
   establishment of OAM functions for MPLS-TP LSPs.  The specific OAM
   functions are specified in the "OAM Function Flags sub-TLV" as
   depicted in [OAM-CONF-FWK].

   When an egress LSR receives an "OAM Configuration TLV" indicating the
   MPLS OAM type, it first will process any present "OAM Function Flags
   sub-TLV" and then MUST process technology specific configuration
   TLVs.  This document defines a new sub-TLV, the "MPLS OAM
   Configuration sub-TLV" that is carried in the "OAM Configuration
   TLV".  IANA is requeted to assign type 33 from the sub-TLV space
   maintained in the RSVP-TE OAM Configuration Registry.

   Type: 33, the "MPLS OAM Configuration sub-TLV".

   Length: indicates the total length including sub-TLVs.

   The following MPLS OAM specific sub-TLVs MAY be included in the the
   "MPLS OAM Configuration sub-TLV":

      - "BFD Configuration sub-TLV", which MUST be included if the CC
      and/or the CV OAM Function flag is set.  This sub-TLV carries
      additional sub-TLVs, failure to include the correct sub-TLVs MUST
      result in an error being generated: "OAM Problem/Configuration
      Error".  The sub-TLVs are:

         - "BFD Identifiers sub-TLV", MUST always be included.

         - "Timer Negotiation Parameters sub-TLV", MUST be included if
         the N flag is not set.

         - "BFD Authentication sub-TLV", MAY be included if the I flag
         is set.

      - "Performance Monitoring sub-TLV", which MUST be included if any
      of the PM/Delay, PM/Loss or PM/Throughput flags are set in the
      "OAM Function Flag sub-TLV".  This sub-TLV MAY carry additional
      sub-TLVs:

         - "MPLS OAM PM Loss sub-TLV" MAY be included if the PM/Loss OAM
         Function flag is set.  If the "MPLS OAM PM Loss sub-TLV" is not
         included, default configuration values are used.  The same sub-
         TLV MAY also be included in case the PM/Throughput OAM Function
         flag is set and there is the need to specify measurement
         interval different from the default ones.  Since throughput
         measurements use the same tool as loss measurements the same
         TLV is used.

         - "MPLS OAM PM Delay sub-TLV" MAY be included if the PM/Delay
         OAM Function flag is set.  If the "MPLS OAM PM Delay sub-TLV"
         is not included, default configuration values are used.

      - "MPLS OAM FMS sub-TLV" MAY be included if the FMS OAM Function
      flag is set.  If the "MPLS OAM FMS sub-TLV" is not included,
      default configuration values are used.

   Moreover, if the CV Flag is set, the CC flag SHOULD be set as well.
   The format of an MPLS-TP CV/CC message is shown in [RFC6428] and it
   requires, together with the BFD Control packet information, the "LSP
   MEP-ID".  The "LSP MEP-ID" contain four identifiers:

      - MPLS-TP Global_ID

      - MPLS-TP Node Identifier

      - Tunnel_Num

      - LSP_Num

   These values need to be correctly set by both ingress and egress when
   transmitting a CV packet and both ingress and egress needs to know
   what to expect when receving a CV packet.  Most of these values can
   be derived from the Path and Resv messages [RFC3473], which uses a
   5-tuple to uniquely identify an LSP within an operator's network.
   This tuple is composed of a Tunnel Sender Address, Tunnel Endpoint
   Address, Tunnel_ID, Extended Tunnel ID, and (GMPLS) LSP_ID.

   However, not all the values can be derived from the standard RSVP-TE
   objects, in particular the locally assigned Tunnel ID at the egress
   cannot be derived by the ingress node.  Therefore, the full LSP MEP-
   ID used by the ingress has to be carried in the "BFD Identifiers sub-
   TLV" in the Path message and the egress LSP MEP-ID in the same way in
   the Resv message.

3.3.  BFD Configuration sub-TLV

   The "BFD Configuration sub-TLV" (depicted below) is defined for BFD
   OAM specific configuration parameters.  The "BFD Configuration sub-
   TLV" is carried as a sub-TLV of the "MPLS OAM Configuration sub-TLV".

   This TLV accommodates generic BFD OAM information and carries sub-
   TLVs.

   Type: 1, the "BFD Configuration sub-TLV".

   Length: indicates the total length including sub-TLVs.

   Version: identifies the BFD protocol version.  If the egress LSR does
   not support the version an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/
   Unsupported BFD Version".

   PHB: Identifies the Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) to be used for periodic
   continuity monitoring messages.

   BFD Negotiation (N): If set timer negotiation/re-negotiation via BFD
   Control Messages is enabled, when cleared it is disabled.

   Symmetric session (S): If set the BFD session MUST use symmetric
   timing values.

   Integrity (I): If set BFD Authentication MUST be enabled.  If the
   "BFD Configuration sub-TLV" does not include a "BFD Authentication
   sub-TLV" the authentication MUST use Keyed SHA1 with an empty pre-
   shared key (all 0s).  If the egress LSR does not support BFD
   Authentication an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/BFD
   Authentication unsupported".

   Encapsulation Capability (G): if set, shows the capability of
   encapsulating BFD messages into The G-Ach channel.  If both the G bit
   and U bit are set, configuration gives precedence to the G bit.  If
   the egress LSR does not support any of the ingress LSR Encapsulation
   Capabilities an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported BFD
   Encapsulation format".

   Encapsulation Capability (U): if set, shows the capability of
   encapsulating BFD messages into UDP packets.  If both the G bit and U
   bit are set, configuration gives precedence to the G bit.  If the
   egress LSR does not support any of the ingress LSR Encapsulation
   Capabilities an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported BFD
   Encapsulation format".

   Bidirectional (B): if set, it configures BFD in the Bidirectional
   mode.  If it is not set it configures BFD in unidirectional mode.  In
   the second case, the source node does not expect any Discriminator
   values back from the destination node.

   Type: 2, "Negotiation Timer Parameters sub-TLV".

   Length: indicates the TLV total length in octets. (16)

   Acceptable Min. Asynchronous TX interval: If the S (symmetric) flag
   is set in the "BFD Configuration sub-TLV", it expresses the desired
   time interval (in microseconds) at which the ingress LER intends to
   both transmit and receive BFD periodic control packets.  If the
   egress LSR can not support the value, it SHOULD reply with a
   supported interval.

   If the S (symmetric) flag is cleared in the "BFD Configuration sub-
   TLV", this field expresses the desired time interval (in
   microseconds) at which the ingress LSR intends to transmit BFD
   periodic control packets.

   Acceptable Min. Asynchronous RX interval: If the S (symmetric) flag
   is set in the "BFD Configuration sub-TLV", this field MUST be equal
   to "Acceptable Min. Asynchronous TX interval" and has no additional
   meaning with respect to the one described for "Acceptable Min.
   Asynchronous TX interval".

   If the S (symmetric) flag is cleared in the "BFD Configuration sub-
   TLV", it expresses the minimum time interval (in microseconds) at
   which the ingress/egress LSRs can receive periodic BFD control
   packets.  If this value is greater than the "Acceptable Min.
   Asynchronous TX interval" received from the ingress/egress LSR, the
   receiving LSR MUST adopt the interval expressed in the "Acceptable
   Min. Asynchronous RX interval".

   Required Echo TX Interval: the minimum interval (in microseconds)
   between received BFD Echo packets that this system is capable of
   supporting, less any jitter applied by the sender as described in
   [RFC5880] sect. 6.8.9.  This value is also an indication for the
   receiving system of the minimum interval between transmitted BFD Echo
   packets.  If this value is zero, the transmitting system does not
   support the receipt of BFD Echo packets.  If the LSR node cannot
   support this value it SHOULD reply with a supported value (which may
   be zero if Echo is not supported).

3.3.3.  BFD Authentication sub-TLV

   The "BFD Authentication sub-TLV" is carried as a sub-TLV of the "BFD
   Configuration sub-TLV" and is depicted below.

   egress LSR does not support this type an "OAM Problem/Unsupported BFD
   Authentication Type" error MUST be generated.

   Auth Key ID: indicates which authentication key or password
   (depending on Auth Type) should be used.  How the key exchange is
   performed is out of scope of this document.If the egress LSR does not
   support this Auth Key ID an "OAM Problem/Mismatch of BFD

3.4.  Performance Monitoring sub-TLV

   If the "OAM Function Flags sub-TLV" has either the PM/Loss, PM/Delay
   or PM/Throughput flag set, the "Performance Monitoring sub-TLV" MUST
   be present in the "MPLS OAM Configuration sub-TLV".  Failure to
   include the correct sub-TLVs MUST result in an "OAM Problem/
   Configuration Error" error being generated.

   The "Performance Monitoring sub-TLV" provides the configuration
   information mentioned in Section 7 of [RFC6374].  It includes support
   for the configuration of quality thresholds and, as described in
   [RFC6374], "the crossing of which will trigger warnings or alarms,
   and result reporting and exception notification will be integrated
   into the system-wide network management and reporting framework."

   In case the values need to be different than the default ones the
   "Performance Monitoring sub-TLV" MAY include the following sub-TLVs:

      - "MPLS OAM PM Loss sub-TLV" if the PM/Loss and/or PM/Throughput
      flag is set in the "OAM Function Flags sub-TLV";

      - "MPLS OAM PM Delay sub-TLV" if the PM/Delay flag is set in the

   Configuration Flags, for the specific function description please
   refer to [RFC6374]:

      - D: Delay inferred/direct (0=INFERRED, 1=DIRECT).  If the egress
      LSR does not support specified mode an "OAM Problem/Unsupported
      Delay Mode" error MUST be generated.

      - L: Loss inferred/direct (0=INFERRED, 1=DIRECT).  If the egress
      LSR does not support specified mode an "OAM Problem/Unsupported
      Loss Mode" error MUST be generated.

      - J: Delay variation/jitter (1=ACTIVE, 0=NOT ACTIVE).  If the
      egress LSR does not support Delay variation measurements and the J
      flag is set, an "OAM Problem/Delay variation unsupported" error
      MUST be generated.

      - Y: Dyadic (1=ACTIVE, 0=NOT ACTIVE).  If the egress LSR does not
      support Dyadic mode and the Y flag is set, an "OAM Problem/Dyadic
      mode unsupported" error MUST be generated.

      - K: Loopback (1=ACTIVE, 0=NOT ACTIVE).  If the egress LSR does
      not support Loopback mode and the K flag is set, an "OAM Problem/
      Loopback mode unsupported" error MUST be generated.

      - C: Combined (1=ACTIVE, 0=NOT ACTIVE).  If the egress LSR does
      not support Combined mode and the C flag is set, an "OAM Problem/

   FMS Signal Flags are used to enable the FMS signals at end point MEPs
   and the Server MEPs of the links over which the LSP is forwarded.  In
   this document only the S flag pertains to Server MEPs.

   The following flags are defined:

      - E: Enable Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) and Lock Report (LKR)
      signalling as described in [RFC6427].  Default value is 1
      (enabled).  If the egress MEP does not support FMS signal
      generation an "OAM Problem/Fault management signaling unsupported"
      error MUST be generated.

      - S: Indicate to a Server MEP that its should transmit AIS and LKR
      signals on client LSPs.  Default value is 0 (disabled).  If a
      Server MEP which is capable of generating FMS messages is for some
      reason unable to do so for the LSP being signalled an "OAM Problem
      /Unable to create fault management association" error MUST be
      generated.

      - T: Set timer value, enabled the configuration of a specific
      timer value.  Default value is 0 (disabled).

      - Remaining bits: Reserved for future specification and set to 0.

   Refresh Timer: indicates the refresh timer of fault indication
   messages, in seconds.  The value MUST be between 1 to 20 seconds as
   specified for the Refresh Timer field in [RFC6427].  If the egress
   LSR cannot support the value it SHOULD reply with a supported timer
   value.

   PHB: identifies the per-hop behavior of packets with fault management
   information.

4.  Summary of MPLS OAM configuration errors

   In addition to error values specified in [OAM-CONF-FWK] this document
   defines the following values for the "OAM Problem" Error Code:

      - If an egress LSR does not support the specified BFD version, an
      error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported BFD Version".

      - If an egress LSR does not support the specified BFD
      Encapsulation format, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/
      Unsupported BFD Encapsulation format".

      - If an egress LSR does not support BFD Authentication, and it is
      requested, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/BFD
      Authentication unsupported".

      - If an egress LSR does not support the specified BFD
      Authentication Type, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/
      Unsupported BFD Authentication Type".

      - If an egress LSR is not able to use the specified Authentication
      Key ID, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/Mismatch of BFD
      Authentication Key ID".

      - If an egress LSR does not support the specified Timestamp
      Format, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported
      Timestamp Format".

      - If an egress LSR does not support specified Delay mode, an "OAM
      Problem/Unsupported Delay Mode" error MUST be generated.

      - If an egress LSR does not support specified Loss mode, an "OAM
      Problem/Unsupported Loss Mode" error MUST be generated.

      - If an egress LSR does not support Delay variation measurements,
      and it is requested, an "OAM Problem/Delay variation unsupported"
      error MUST be generated.

      - If an egress LSR does not support Dyadic mode, and it is
      requested, an "OAM Problem/Dyadic mode unsupported" error MUST be
      generated.

      - If an egress LSR does not support Loopback mode, and it is
      requested, an "OAM Problem/Loopback mode unsupported" error MUST
      be generated.

      - If an egress LSR does not support Combined mode, and it is
      requested, an "OAM Problem/Combined mode unsupported" error MUST
      be generated.

      - If an egress LSR does not support Fault Monitoring Signals, and
      it is requested, an "OAM Problem/Fault management signaling
      unsupported" error MUST be generated.

      - If an intermediate server MEP supports Fault Monitoring Signals
      but is unable to create an association, when requested to do so,
      an "OAM Problem/Unable to create fault management association"
      error MUST be generated.

5.  IANA Considerations

   requested to allocate a new type (33) from the sub-TLV space of the
   RSVP-TE OAM Configuration Registry.  IANA is also requested to assign
   type (2) for MPLS OAM from the OAM Type space of the same registry.

   for their useful comments.

7.  Security Considerations

   The signaling of OAM related parameters and the automatic
   establishment of OAM entities introduces additional security
   considerations to those discussed in [RFC3473].  In particular, a
   network element could be overloaded if an attacker were to request
   high frequency liveliness monitoring of a large number of LSPs,
   targeting a single network element as discussed in [OAM-CONF-FWK] and
   [RFC6060].
