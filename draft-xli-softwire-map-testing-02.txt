Abstract

   This document presents the testing results of a unified code
   accommodating encapsulation and translation modes of Mapping of
   Address and Port (MAP).  Experiments show that the unified MAP CE is
   not only supporting MAP-E and MAP-T modes, but also backward
   compatible with AFTR of dual-stack lite and stateless/stateful NAT64.

Internet-Draft    MAP Interoperability Testing Results         July 2013


1.  Introduction

   Generic mechanism for mapping between an IPv4 prefix, address or
   parts of thereof, and transport layer ports and an IPv6 prefix or
   address with translation mode and encapsulation mode are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-t] [I-D.ietf-softwire-map].  This document
   presents testing results of a unified code containing translation and
   encapsulation modes of Mapping of Address and Port (MAP).  The
   backward compatibility of MAP CE with AFTR of dual-stack lite and
   NAT64 of stateful translation are also presented.

1.1.  Testing Topology

   The testing topology is shown in the following figure.

                                                  -----     ------
                                               .-| CE.0|---|Host.0|
                                              /   -----     ------
           ------                  -----     |
         /  The   \    -----     /  An   \   |    -----     ------
        |   IPv4   |--| BR  |---|   IPv6  |------| CE.1|---|Host.1|
         \Internet/   |     | ^  \Network/   |    -----     ------
           ------      -----  |    -----     |
                              |               \   -----     ------
                           tcpdump              -| CE.K|---|Host.K|
                                                  -----     ------

                    Figure 1: Generic testing topology

   Where, BR is the MAP Border Relay, CE is the MAP Customer Edge.  Both
   BR and CE can be configured in translation mode (MAP-T) or
   encapsulation mode (MAP-E), independently.  A tcpdump process is
   running between BR and CE to get the packet header information.


2.  MAP specifications

   The code tested in this document follows the MAP specification
   defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-t] [I-D.ietf-softwire-map], which
   contain the Mapping Rules, the Port Mapping Algorithm and the
   Forwarding Mode.  The explicit address format and configuration
   parameters used for the code are presented in the following sections.

2.1.  Mapping Rules and the Address Formats

   The address format of Basic Mapping Rule (BMR) and Forwarding Mapping
   Rule (FMR) are defined in the following figure.  Also note that
   translation mode (MAP-T) and encapsulation mode (MAP-E) have the same

   address format of BMR/FMR.

         Figure 2: BMR/FMR in translation and encapsulation modes

   The address format of Default Mapping Rule is different for
   translation (MAP-T) and encapsulation (MAP-E), as shown in the
   following figures.

                    Figure 4: DMR in encapsulation mode

   The testing presented in this document is for the Hubs and Spokes
   scenario, and therefore, only BMR and DMR are required in each CE.

2.2.  Port Mapping Algorithm

   The port mapping algorithm is called Generalized Modulus Algorithm
   (GMA), which contains the sharing ratio (R=2^k), the maximum number
   of contiguous ports (M=2^m) and the Port-Set Identifiers (PSID).

2.3.  Forwarding Modes

   The MAP has two forwarding modes, the translation (MAP-T) and
   encapsulation (MAP-E).  The header processing algorithms of the

   translation and the encapsulation modes are defined in [RFC6145] and
   [RFC2473], respectively.

2.4.  Implementation

   The MAP specification is implemented in Linux environment under GPL
   [map-code].

   The CE related configuration parameters are:

   -i specify the name of the Ethernet device connected to IPv4 world

   -I specify the name of the Ethernet device connected to IPv6 world

   -H specify in CE mode

   -a specify the IPv4 address and mask of the host behind the CE

   -P specify the IPv6 rule prefix and prefix length of the host behind
      the CE

   -R specify the associated IPv4 address sharing ratio R of the host
      behind the CE

   -M specify the associated M parameter of the host behind the CE
      device

   -o specify the PSID of the host behind the CE

   -N specify in NAT44 mode.  The '-A' option is required.

   -A specify the public IPv4 address and mask which the host behind the
      CE device is mapped into.  In this case, the '-a' option will
      specify the private IPv4 network and prefix length

   -X specify the IPv6 prefix is not containing EA-bits


3.  MAP Testing

   The configuration examples and the testing results of the MAP's
   translation mode (MAP-T), the encapsulation mode (MAP-E), MAP-T/MAP-E
   1:1 modes and the mixed MAP-T/MAP-E modes are shown in this section.

   The basic testing method is from an IPv4 host connected to CE to ping
   an IPv4 server (202.112.35.254) connected to BR.  The tcpdump records
   the packet headers of the echo request and echo reply messages.

   The tcpdump data samples are:

      reply, id 4113, seq 7276, length 40

3.4.  Mixed MAP-T/MAP-E

   The CE and BR can be configured in different modes, for example CE
   can be configured in translation mode and BR can be configured in
   encapsulation mode.  The reason is that the forwarding mode is only
   required in the IPv4 to IPv6 direction, while it can be automatically
   identified by checking the value of the next header in the IPv6
   packets in the IPv6 to IPv4 direction.  This feature provides great
   flexibility to the users and operators to select desired forwarding
   mode without dropping a single packet in different forwarding mode.
   The following are two examples of BR and CE in different forwarding
   modes with the configurations shown in MAP-T and MAP-E sections.

   When BR is in T mode and CE is in E mode, the tcpdump data samples
   are:

      09:39:48.829067 IP6 2001:da8:b4b6:180:ca:2675:180:0 > 2001:da8:

      request, id 1040, seq 47104, length 40

   When BR is in E mode and CE is in T mode, the tcpdump data samples
   are:

      09:44:11.692130 IP6 2001:da8:b4b6:100:ca:2675:100:0 > 2001:da8:

4.  Backward Compatibility Testing

   The MAP CE is backward compatible to dual-stack lite in the E mode
   and to NAT64 in the T mode.

4.1.  AFTR of dual-stack lite

   Dual-stack lite is a stateful encapsulation technology defined in
   [RFC6333].  For the testing, the MAP BR is replaced by dual-stack
   lite AFTR [dual-stack-lite-code].

   The MAP CE is configured as:

      utils/ivictl -r -d -P 2001::1/128

      utils/ivictl -s -i eth1 -I eth0 -H -N -X -a 192.168.1.0/24 -A
      10.255.255.1/24 -P 2001:da8:b001:1009::/64 -R 16 -M 2 -o 0 -c 1400
      -E

   The tcpdump data samples are:

      22:48:42.536559 IP6 2001:da8:b001:1009:a:ffff:100:0 > 2001::1: IP

4.2.  NAT64 with double translation

   NAT64 is a stateful translation technology defined in [RFC6146] and
   [RFC6145].  For the testing, the MAP BR is replaced by NAT64
   [nat64-code].

   The MAP CE is configured as:

      utils/ivictl -r -d -P 2001:da8:b4b6:1000::/64 -T

      utils/ivictl -s -i eth1 -I eth0 -H -N -X -a 192.168.1.0/24 -A
      2.2.2.2/32 -P 2001:da8:b001:fff9::/64 -R 16 -M 2 -o 0 -c 1440 -T

   The tcpdump data samples are:

      09:24:16.478385 IP6 2001:da8:b001:fff9:2:202:200:0 > 2001:da8:
      b4b6:1000:ca:7023:fe00:0: ICMP6, echo request, seq 25600, length
      40

      09:24:16.479638 IP6 2001:da8:b4b6:1000:ca:7023:fe00:0 > 2001:da8:
      b001:fff9:2:202:200:0: ICMP6, echo reply, seq 25600, length 40

   Note that for this scenario, the CE defined in [RFC6877] can also
   achieve this goal.


5.  Conclusions

   Although only the echo request/echo reply testing results with the
   corresponding MAP CE configuration examples are presented in this
   document, the TCP/UDP applications are also tested in CERNET/CERNET2
   successfully.  The concluding remarks are:

   o  A unified MAP can support MAP-T, MAP-E, 1:1 mode MAP-T/MAP-E and
      even the mixed modes without introducing additional complexity.

   o  A unified MAP CE can be configured to support MAP-T, MAP-E, 1:1
      mode MAP-T/MAP-E, mixed MAP-T/MAP-E, and backward compatible with
      stateless NAT64, stateful NAT64 and dual-stack lite.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations.
