             Problem Statement for Fixed Mobile Convergence
                    draft-xue-intarea-fmc-ps-00.txt

Abstract

   The purpose of this document is to analyze the issues that have
   arisen so far and then to propose a set of requirements for the Fixed
   Mobile Convergence.  The term Fixed Mobile Convergence spans several
   scenarios from true integration of fixed and mobile terminals,
   services, and network infrastructure on both technical and management
   level down to pure interworking between fixed and mobile networks in
   serving access for multi-interface terminals like todays'
   smartphones.  In the interworking scenario, the mobile network passes
   on the mobile subscribers policies to the fixed broadband network in
   order to maintain the end-to-end service level agreement and to
   support remote terminal and access network management.  Explicitly,
   the fixed broadband network must have partnership with the mobile
   network in Fixed Mobile Convergence interworking scenario.  This
   document gives a brief overview of the assumed Fixed Mobile
   Convergence architecture and related works and then introduces
   several requirements based on the partnership in Fixed Mobile
   Convergence architecture, such as User Equipment identification and
   authentication, Femto Access Point management, device type
   identification and mobility considerations.

1.  Introduction

   Growing availability of intelligent mobile devices and mature
   networks of operators providing both reliable carrier grade
   connectivity and affordable high bandwidth access offer to the
   customer a nice climate of mobile broadband.  With widespread
   availability and easy usability of mobile broadband, mobile broadband
   applications become more ubiquitous.  Subscribers demand for various
   service applications, especially Internet applications, such as
   mobile Internet video, mobile Internet real-time communication, etc.

   The subscribers requirements lay the foundation of mobile broadband.
   On the other hand, simultaneously, the subscribers' services promote
   the evolution of mobile broadband, which will impact the network
   architecture.  The flourishing mobile applications demand more and
   more bandwidth offered by the operators.  Even with wireless networks
   becoming mature, such as 3G and LTE, the average bandwidth offered is
   not comparable to data rates offered by fixed networks.  With data
   services rapidly increasing, the traditional cellular network
   operating at a shared medium and thus being limited in transmission
   rate often becomes the bottle-neck of mobile broadband.  In addition
   radio network technology generally requires high capital investment
   and operational expenditures.  Cellular network operators are facing
   the challenge of increasing traffic demand at decreasing revenue and
   have to provide means of more cost efficient access technology in a
   highly competitive environment.  The trend of offloading the traffic
   to fixed broadband network is emerging.  Mobile industry has
   specified functionalities to offload the data traffic to the fixed
   broadband (FBB) network, via WLAN or a Home (e)NodeB (HNB or eNodeB,
   aka.  Femtocell) [TR23.829], which could alleviate traffic pressure
   on the mobile network.  That is to say, today, operators are able to
   employ mechanisms to manage the subscriber service over both the
   mobile and the fixed broadband network.  We can say, FMC is emerging
   on the basis of subscribers and operators requirements.

   Fixed Mobile Convergence is a technology trend which aims to provide
   the subscribers access to services regardless of the access network
   type they are connecting to and provide the operators with the
   flexibility to ensure transparency of services to the end user.  For
   a mobile subscriber to access services over both mobile and fixed
   broadband networks seamlessly, additionally, the subscriber's end-to-
   end service level agreement (SLA) must be maintained.  This is
   achieved by interworking the control planes of the fixed broadband
   network and the mobile network.

   In the FMC interworking scenario addressed here, the fixed broadband
   network must partner with the mobile network to perform
   authorisation, authentication, and accounting (AAA) and acquire the

   policies for the mobile subscriber.  Please note, a single converged
   control plane, used for both the fixed broadband and the mobile
   network, may be used in a truely converged, i.e. integrated
   convergence scenario.  This document only focuses on the interworking
   scenario in this version.  The convergence scenario is for further
   study.

   Figure 1 shows the assumed reference architecture of Fixed Mobile
   Convergence Interworking for a Mobile (3GPP) Network and a fixed non-
   3GPP access network as proposed by 3GPP and BroadBand Forum (BBF) as
   an example in document [WT203].

   The policy and charging control (PCC) system is an important element
   in FMC architecture.  PCC system of FMC consists of policy decision
   point (PCRF in the mobile network and BPCF in the fixed broadband
   network) and the policy enforcement point (PGW and BNG,
   respectively), shown in Figure 1.  PCC should support for controlling

   the QoS (e.g., QoS class and bit rates) authorized for service, and
   IP flow based charging.  In FMC interworking scenario, these services
   can be divided into four types.

   1.  Service via macrocell wireless network

   2.  Service via WiFi/Femtocell access routed back to 3GPP Evolved
       Packet Core (EPC), where the fixed broadband network is used as
       the access network,

       *  The service from a mobile UE is connected to WiFi or to
          Femtocell Access Point (FAP) at the residential gateway (RG),
          routed back to 3GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC).

   3.  Services via WiFi access only fixed broadband routed

       *  The service from a mobile UE is connected to WiFi without
          traversing the mobile network.

       *  In this scenario, the UE service may be guaranteed based on
          subscriber's policy from the mobile network.

   4.  LIPA/SIPTO traffic

       *  Support of Local IP access (LIPA) and of Selected IP traffic
          offload (SIPTO) for the Home (e)NodeB Subsystem and for the
          macro layer network include a more integrated FMC scenario and
          thus are for further study.

   As for the services stated above, only the second and the third type
   are related to FMC, where both the fixed broadband and the mobile
   network are involved.  The FMC architecture shall be capable to set
   operator policies to support simultaneous access to these service.

   In the network today, deploying FMC is a worthy way for operators to
   satisfy subscriber's requirement and ease pressure from bandwidth.
   In the following sections, we first describe the motivation and then
   discuss the key issues in FMC interworking scenario.

3.  Motivation

   The motivation is to highlight and discuss the issues when
   facilitating FMC.  We systematically analyze the issues that have
   been proposed so far and briefly assess the possible extensions which
   could solve the problems.  In the network architecture, we target and
   limit the scope to the interworking architecture for FMC.  The
   convergence architecture is out of scope.

   Regarding the traffic management and control requirements in FMC
   interworking scenario, there are five essential issues from an IETF
   Internet Area and fixed broadband network point of view, as follows.

   1.  UE identification in fixed broadband network

   2.  Femto Access Point management

   3.  Device type identification

   4.  UE Mobility in fixed broadband network

   5.  Flow Mobility

   In Section 4 below, we discuss the key issues and some problems based
   on the FMC architecture.  There are many standardization issues
   related to FMC and protocol extension work needed are stated in this
   document.

   If these issues are fixed, the advantages brought out will be:

   1.  Optimize traffic management (per-UE granularity in the fixed
       broadband network)

   2.  Enhance device management (via IP address synchronization between
       fixed broadband network and mobile network)

   3.  Reduce operators load on Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) (bypass the
       unnecessary traffic)

   4.  Quick Responsiveness based on UE status


4.  Key issues in Fixed Mobile Converged Interworking

   This section provides some key issues related to FMC when deployed.
   These issues, which motivate the FMC, must be resolved.  It is
   difficult to foresee the most suitable solutions to resolve these
   issues now, but in any event, some possibilities need to be analysed



Xue, et al.             Expires September 3, 2012               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                 PS for FMC                     March 2012


   based on the scenarios.  Mobile network solutions of these issues are
   out of scope.

4.1.  UE identification and AAA management in fixed broadband network

   A user accessing a network point of attachment has to be authorised
   and authenticated by the network as well as vice versa to assure
   reliability of service as well as proper exchange of accounting
   information.  That is the identity of the user and the AAA
   credentials have to be transferred and acknowledged.  In addition a
   unique identity has to be assigned to the customer and/or his
   terminal, i.e. to maintain a session, a routable IP address has to be
   provided.  Detailed consideration of AAA issues is out of sccope of
   this document.

   Nowadays, a subscriber is always provided with a single private IPv4
   address at their home or small business, which should reduce the
   pressure on the available public IPv4 addresses which are now
   exhausted.  For instance, in the fixed broadband network, each host
   within the local network will be assigned a private IPv4 address,
   then NA(P)T function is responsible for translating the private IPv4
   address to the public IPv4 address assigned to the CPE (Customer
   Premises Equipment) by operators, and vice versa.

   As a result of maintaining growth of IPv4 service, private addressing
   plan will require address sharing, which will cause issues for
   operators, such as traffic management, QoS enforcement, etc. in the
   FMC scenarios, where the policy control must be based on the
   fundamental concept of per-UE granularity.  Note that ultimately,
   deploying IPv6 is the only perennial way to ease pressure on the
   public IPv4 address without the need for address sharing mechanisms
   that give rise to the issues identified herein.  But in the interim,
   however, IPv4 services are also very important for end-users, and
   service providers, which can not be ignored.

   The FMC architecture shall be capable to set operator policies to
   support simultaneous access to mobile services and traffic offloading
   to the fixed broadband network.  Accordingly, regarding policy and
   QoS interworking between the fixed broadband and mobile
   architectures, we consider the following scenarios:

   1.  Mobile UE with mobile-routed traffic and no NAT in Residential
       Gateway (RG)

   2.  Mobile UE with mobile-routed traffic with NAT in RG

   3.  Mobile UE with offloaded traffic and no NAT in RG

   Currently PCC can support case 1 and 3, but issues will be introduced
   in cases 2 and 4 because of address sharing via NA(P)T. The important
   consideration is that today's PCC (including QoS control and IP flow
   based charging) must be based on the fundamental concept of IP
   Connectivity Access Network (IP-CAN) in per-UE granularity.  IP-CAN
   session [TS23.203] is the association between a UE and an IP network.
   So in FMC network, it is assumed that fixed broadband network could
   manage the traffic in per-UE granularity.

   Obviously, the fixed broadband network and mobile network must
   support inter-operator subscribers policy exchange, this introduces a
   major challenge on how to coordinate UE identification across the
   operators' domains so that the mobile network can inform the suitable
   policy to the serving fixed broadband access network that its mobile
   user equipment (UE) is attached to.  So that the fixed broadband

   network can provide the appropriate FMC interworking policy and
   bearer control on UE's traffic.

   There may be limitations with BNG implementations with respect to the
   level of granularity (per-UE) of the enforcement.  Take case 4 for an
   example, a key problem is to identify offloaded traffic from a
   special UE, i.e.  UE identification substantively, behind the NA(P)T
   embedded into RG, there is no longer a unique IP address per UE, in
   addition, the UDP port behind NA(P)T is not bound to the special UE.

   Another factor that contributes to UE identification is efficient
   packet inspection.  Operators expect the fixed broadband network
   could be configured in such a way that the traffic subject to packet
   inspection is routed via the Traffic Detection Function (TDF)
   [TS29.212], otherwise, the traffic that is not subject to packet
   inspection may bypass the TDF.  This assumption only holds if it is
   possible to identify individual UEs behind NA(P)T embedded into the
   RG in fixed broadband network, shown in Figure 2.  Issues may arise
   if there is a NA(P)T in or beyond the RG, even a NA(P)T in or beyond
   the BNG.  As a result, additional mechanisms are needed to enable
   this.

   As discussed before, there are many drivers for the UE identification
   in the broadband network.  They include efficient packet inspection,
   QoS enforcement, charging.  We can note that all these functions in
   FMC depend on being able to identify UEs behind the NA(P)T.

   There are several possibilities which provide solutions.  One
   recommendation from fixed broadband, defined in [WT146], is to bind
   the UDP port (after NA(P)T) to the special UE.  This solution has
   limitations because it may not be feasible due to static
   configuration in RG, to provide unique UDP port numbers to all the
   devices on user side.  This is the overload scenario for operators.

   Beside 3GPP-defined algorithms to derive unique identities for use
   within a fixed access network from 3GPP-specified SIM (Subscriber
   Identity Module) such as in [EAP-SIM, RFC 4186] or [EAP-AKA, RFC 4187
   or EAP-AKA', RFC 5448] there are several possible IP or TCP protocol
   extensions, discussed in [I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis].  In
   that draft, TCP host identifier option is also discussed.
   Additionally, there may be other possibilities, such as some other
   new identifier to be defined, etc.  It is difficult to foresee which
   is the suitable solution, more work needs to be done.

4.2.  Femto Access Point Management

   Femtocells (FAPs), whose architecture is specified in the mobile
   standards (e.g., 3GPP, Femto Forum, etc.), are an exemplary feature
   of an FMC network.  The access network to which Femtocells are
   attached is the fixed broadband network as depicted in Figure 3.  As
   mentioned before, in order to achieve PCC, there is a need for the
   fixed broadband network to have partnership with mobile network to
   maintain the service level agreement (SLA).  Here, the private IPv4
   addressing plan in fixed broadband network introduces the
   limitations, which was described in the draft
   [I-D.so-ipsecme-ikev2-cpext].  In today's generic FAP architecture,
   it is difficult to guarantee a unique mapping, shown as follows:

   1.  Determine the UE attached FAP's public IPv4 address together with
       the translated port number of the UDP header of the encapsulated
       IPsec tunnel between the FAP and the Security Gateway (SeGW)
       which are assigned by the fixed broadband network.  The FAP's
       public IPv4 address is:

       *  used for identifying the location of the FAP,

       *  used for identifying the UE's traffic at the fixed broadband
          network.

   2.  Determine the corresponding FAP's public IPv4 address's
       association with the UE's inner-IPv4 address which is assigned by
       the mobile network.  The association is:

       *  used for identifying the mobile UE that is attached to the FAP
          in order to allow the PCRF to retrieve the UE's policy to be
          passed onto the BPCF at the fixed broadband network.

   Due to the requirement for inter-operators subscribers policy
   exchange, the private and public addressing which rely on NA(P)T,
   must be coordinated cross the operators domains.  Additionally, FAP
   location must be identified for management.  These major factors

   drive the solutions in interworking architecture with Femtocell
   scenario such as extending IKEv2 [RFC5996], so that the overall
   service performance and the user experience could be enhanced.

4.3.  Device type identification

   As there are multiple types of user terminal devices, e.g.  PDA,
   mobile phone, personal computer, etc. with different characteristic
   capabilities (portability, screen size, audio output etc.) for some
   service applications and corresponding QoS and management
   requirements, it is important for operators to capture the service-
   specific terminal device type, especially in FMC interworking
   scenario.  In such cases, different rules for policy control and
   traffic routing are needed to be provided by the operators to ensure
   acceptable SLA to the device.

   When WiFi is deployed for traffic offload, the terminal devices, such
   as mobile phone and personal computer could be used for service.  In
   this case, only the traffic from the 3GPP service, such as mobile
   voice may need policy control and management.  The best effort
   traffic will not be routed via the mobile core (EPC) and thus has no
   impact to the FMC at all.  With this method, the traffic management
   optimization generally occurs based on selecting suitable types of
   device which need special policy control and management.

   In the current WiFi network, the device type information is
   transparent to the fixed broadband network, because only IP and port
   information is used for identification.  It is difficult for BNG to
   distinguish the traffic from UE device, and then route it specially.
   So a solution is needed to identify the device type, especially at
   the BNG.

4.4.  UE Mobility in Fixed Broadband Network

   The users are the mobile subscribers in FMC.  Note that all the
   services depend on the substantive character of subscriber's
   mobility.  It is important for operators to capture the user device
   when it is moving into or outside the network, even in WiFi access.
   Besides, the application and service from the subscriber must be
   guaranteed based on the policy of operators.

   In mobile network today, there are many mature solutions offered for
   user's mobility already.  Herein, only mobility in fixed access,
   i.e., WiFi access, will be considered.  For example, the user device
   is attached to the home LAN (e.g., WiFi ) network, and establishes a
   connection back to the subscriber's mobile service provider network
   via the fixed broadband network.  The mobile operator should
   cooperate with the broadband access operator to deliver proper policy

   for the service from UE.

   The mobility considered in the fixed access is a little different.
   In this section, we divide the mobility capability into two cases:

   1.  UE is moving into or outside the coverage area of WiFi AP

   2.  UE's WiFi access is dormant or not.

   The following figure shows an example of the scenario where mobile
   UEs are served in WiFi deployment over the fixed broadband network.
   RG embeds WiFi AP and NA(P)T function.  Each UE is provided with a
   single private IPv4 address assigned within the local network.
   NA(P)T in RG is responsible for translating the private IPv4 address
   to the public IPv4 address assigned by the fixed operator.

             Figure 4: Mobility in the Fixed Broadband Network

   As described previously, BPCF in fixed broadband network must have
   partnership with PCRF in mobile network in order to maintain the
   service level agreement (SLA).  In order to allow the PCRF to
   retrieve the UE's policy to be passed onto the BPCF in the fixed
   broadband network, it is mainly concerned about the traffic and UE
   identification binding used to achieve the actual traffic control.
   The BPCF/BNG will perform the policy control based on the binding.

   Based on the UE's mobility, issues will arise.  For example, the PCRF
   will retrieve the wrong policy to the BPCF, if the UE identification
   can not be updated in time.  For instance, there are two UEs, shown

   in Figure 4.  UE1 and UE2 are assigned different private IP addresses
   within the local network, IP1 and IP2 accordingly.  After NAPT, BPCF/
   BNG will be based on the public IPv4 address and the different UDP
   port numbers assigned by NAPT to perform the admission control and
   policy enforcement on the UE's traffic.

   Since plenty of UEs may move into the coverage of WiFi AP, it is
   possible that the same UDP port will be used for both UE1 and UE2 at
   the different time period.  For example, UE1 moved out of the WiFi
   coverage and later the UE2 moved in.  The same UDP port used by UE1
   before is assigned to UE2 again.  As mentioned, the identification
   must be consistent between fixed broadband network and the mobile
   network for policy exchange.  So the UDP port used as part of UE
   identification must be updated in time based on the status of UE,
   otherwise the PCRF will confused about which policy is used.

   Especially, there may be a requirement to binding the UDP port to a
   special UE described in Section 4.  The UDP ports must be cleared if
   the UEs corresponding to prior port binding are out of coverage of
   the WiFi AP.  That is to say the configuration must be updated
   regularly to satisfy that the WiFi AP can serve thousands of UEs.
   Other solutions to solve the issue in Section 4 may also fix this
   challenge introduced by the mobility of UE.

   Based on the discussion, for UE's mobility in WiFi network, we can
   recognize that the important requirement for the fixed broadband
   network is to update the UE identification based on UE mobility.  In
   this scenario, the fixed broadband network must be able to update the
   record for UE during the UE mobility.

4.5.  Flow Mobility between different interface

   Traffic offloading requires the ability to move the traffic flows
   from one interface to the other interface of the UE.  The type of
   flows to be moved depends on the policy and should be dictated by the
   mobile operator.

   Several IP flow mobility protocol approaches are under discussion
   some of which have been already adopted for use in mobile networks,
   e.g. by 3GPP, but currently no such flow mobility protocol has been
   applied for use in an fixed broadband network, e.g. by BBF.  Without
   an overarching commonly agreed on flow mobility protocol, offloading
   traffic from mobile network to fixed broadband network can simply not
   be achieved.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request to IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   Serious concern of mobile operators towards FMC approaches has been
   the customer access via networks not under control of the operator.
   Operators would like to keep their own high security measures to
   prevent various kinds of fraud or attack to the operators services
   and network entities.  Well known risks and vulnerabilities which are
   common to any NA(P)T application are documented in the NAT
   specification [RFC2663].  Any additional security considerations
   arising from FMC are TBD.
