Internet-Draft       NHDP and OLSRv2 Extension TLVs            July 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol, version 2 [OLSRv2] is a
   proactive link state routing protocol designed for use in mobile ad
   hoc networks (MANETs) [RFC2501].  This document updates that
   specification, and that of the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol
   (NHDP) [RFC6130], which is used by OLSRv2.  These updates to the TLV
   (Type-Length-Value) elements used in these specifications increase
   the extensibility of these protocols, and permit some improvements in
   their implementation.

   This specification reduces the latitude of implementations of
   [OLSRv2] and [RFC6130] to consider some messages, which will not be
   created by implementations simply following those specifications, as
   a reason to consider the message as badly formed, and thus as a
   reason to reject the message.  This gives greater latitude to the
   creation of extensions of these protocols, in particular extensions
   that will interoperate with unextended implementations of those
   protocols.  As part of that, it indicates how TLVs (Type-Length-Value
   elements) [RFC5444] with unexpected value fields should be handled,
   and adds some additional options to those TLVs.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses the terminology of [RFC5444],
   [RFC6130], and [OLSRv2].


3.  Applicability Statement

   This document updates the specification of the protocols [OLSRv2] and
   [RFC6130].  As such it is applicable to all implementations of these
   protocols.

   Both [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] define a number of TLVs that have only
   some TLV values used.  This extension removes the latitude of an
   implementation to consider the use of other TLV values as errors,
   thereby permitting their use in extensions.  For relevant TLVs, TLV
   values for "no information" are also defined, which can make the
   creation of multivalue TLVs more efficient.  Finally, the
   interpretation of two TLV values (MPR and NBR_ADDR_TYPE) is redefined
   as bit fields, which may have a minor impact on some implementations'

Internet-Draft       NHDP and OLSRv2 Extension TLVs            July 2013


   interpretation of such fields in received messages.

   Specifically, this specification updates [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] in
   the following way:

   o  Removes the latitude of rejecting a message with a TLV with a
      known type, but with an unknown value, for the TLV Types defined
      in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2].

   o  Sets up IANA registries for TLV Values for the Address Block TLVs:

      *  LOCAL_IF, defined in [RFC6130].

      *  LINK_STATUS, defined in [RFC6130].

      *  OTHER_NEIGHB, defined in [RFC6130].

      *  MPR, defined in [OLSRv2], now considered as a bit field.

      *  NBR_ADDR_TYPE, defined in [OLSRv2], now considered as a bit
         field.

   o  Defines a well-known TLV Value for "UNSPECIFIED" for the Address
      Block TLV Types LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS, and OTHER_NEIGHB, all
      defined in [RFC6130].


4.  Unknown TLV Values

   NHDP [RFC6130] and OLSRv2 [OLSRv2] define a number of TLVs within the
   framework of [RFC5444].  A number of these TLVs specify the meaning
   of only some possible values that may occur in the value field of a
   TLV.  For example the LINK_STATUS TLV defined in [RFC6130] has an
   8-bit value field, yet specifies a meaning only for the values 0
   (LOST), 1 (SYMMETRIC) AND 2 (HEARD).

   These protocols also specify that, in addition to well-defined
   reasons (in the respective protocol specifications), an
   implementation of these protocols MAY recognize a message as badly
   formed and therefore invalid for processing for other reasons
   (Section 12.1 of [RFC6130] and Section 16.3.1 of [OLSRv2]).  The
   primary reason for that is to enable the implementation of extensions
   such as [NHDP-OLSRv2-sec].  These sections could however be
   interpreted as allowing rejection of a message because a TLV value is
   unknown.  This specification removes that latitude:

   o  An implementation MUST NOT reject a message because it contains
      such a TLV.  Instead any unknown value MUST be treated, by an

Internet-Draft       NHDP and OLSRv2 Extension TLVs            July 2013


      unextended implementation of NHSP or OLSRv2, as if the TLV were
      not present.

   Such unknown TLV values may be defined in later specifications.
   Thus, where appropriate, the TLVs specified in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2]
   are re-defined with their value fields being extensible registries,
   and with initial registrations for values defined and used by
   [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] - see Section 5.

   An extra entry has been added to relevant registries, to represent a
   value that is to permanently indicate "no information".  The utility
   of this lies in considering multi-value TLVs, as defined in
   [RFC5444].

   [RFC5444] defines a multi-value TLV that may be used to assign
   information, such as link status, to more than one address in an
   Address Block.  Multi-value TLVs often represent an efficient (in
   terms of message size) way to convey the indicated information.
   However only consecutively recorded addresses may be covered by a
   multivalue TLV.  If conveying only one or two pieces of information,
   it is possible to order address so as to efficiently use multivalue
   TLVs, but if conveying more, then this is no longer possible.  In
   that case, more than one TLV may be needed for a single type of
   information.  With the definition of a TLV value to mean "no
   information", greater use of multivalue TLVs is possible, allowing
   both more efficient messages and simpler implementations.  (An
   implementation must still be able to recognize whatever pattern of
   TLVs the sender chooses to use.)

   It should be stressed that this is not a change to [RFC6130] or
   [OLSRv2], except with regard to not allowing this to be a reason for
   rejection of a message.  These protocols are specified in terms such
   as "if an address is associated with a value of LOST by a LINK_STATUS
   TLV".  Association with an unknown value (or a value newly defined to
   mean no link status information) has no effect on such a
   specification.

   Specific cases that are affected are described in Section 5.  In
   three cases (LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS, OTHER_NEIGHB) there is no impact
   on [RFC6130] or [OLSRv2].  In two cases (MPR and NBR_ADDR_TYPE, used
   only by [OLSRv2]) the value is now to be interpreted as a bit field.
   As the existing definitions of values 1, 2, and 3 behave in that
   manner, it is likely that this will involve no change to an
   implementation, but any test of (for example) Value = 1 or Value = 3
   MUST be converted to a test of (for example) Value bitand 1 = 1,
   where "bitand" denotes a bitwise and operation.

   Not reported, because unchanged, is the LINK_METRIC TLV.  However it

Internet-Draft       NHDP and OLSRv2 Extension TLVs            July 2013


   should be noted that any (two octet) value with all four most
   significant bits clear (0) is a case that conveys no information
   about the network address (and which will, at least as far as this
   TLV is concerned, be not used by OLSRv2).  It is RECOMMENDED that
   when using such a value deliberately that the remaining twelve bits
   be either all clear (0) or all set (1).  However any received pattern
   of bits MUST be so interpreted.


5.  IANA Considerations

   Note: Values defined as "Unallocated: Expert Review" mean that these
   values may be allocated according to the expert review guidelines
   specified in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2].  In two cases a constraint on
   future allocation is specified.

5.1.  Address Block TLVs

   IANA is requested to create a registry associated with the Address
   Block TLV with name LOCAL_IF (Type = 2, Type Extension = 0) defined
   in [RFC6130], specifying the meaning of its single values.  This
   replaces the Description column in Table 6 in [RFC6130] by a
   reference to this table.

   | 224-254 |             |              Experimental Use             |

   |         |             |                is provided                |
   +---------+-------------+-------------------------------------------+

                       Table 1: LOCAL_IF TLV Values

   IANA are requested to create a registry associated with the Address
   Block TLV with name LINK_STATUS (Type = 3, Type Extension = 0)
   defined in [RFC6130], specifying the meaning of its single values.
   This replaces the Description column in Table 7 in [RFC6130] by a
   reference to this table.

   combination of the bits FLOODING + ROUTING being set (1) (which gives
   a value of 3) is given the name FLOOD_ROUTE in [OLSRv2].  For all
   future allocations, the Expert Review MUST ensure that allocated bits
   MUST use the unset bit (0) to indicates no information, so that the
   case Value = 0 will always indicate that no information about this

6.  Security Considerations

   The presented updates to [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2]:

   o  Create IANA registries for retaining TLV values for TLVs, already
      defined in the already published specifications of the two
      protocols, and with initial registrations for the TLV values
      defined by these specifications.  This does not give rise to any
      additional security considerations.

   o  Enable protocol extensions to be able to register TLV values in
      the created IANA registries.  Such extensions MUST specify
      appropriate security considerations.

   o  Create, in some registries, a registration for "UNSPECIFIED"
      values, for more efficient use of multi-value Address Block TLVs.
      The interpretation of an address being associated with a TLV of a
      given type and with the value "UNSPECIFIED" is identical to that
      address not being associated with a TLV of that type.  Thus, this
      update does not give rise to any additional security
      considerations.

   o  Reduces the latitude of implementations of the two protocols to
      reject a message as badly formed, due to the value of a TLV being
      unknown.  These protocols are specified in terms such as "if an
      address is associated with a value of LOST by a LINK_STATUS TLV".
      Association with an unknown value (or a value newly defined to
      mean no link status information) has no effect on such a
      specification.  Thus, this update does not give rise to any
      additional security considerations.

   o  Do not introduce any new protocol signals, nor any additional or
      changed processing, compared to the already published
      specifications of the two protocols.
