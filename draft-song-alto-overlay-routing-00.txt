              ALTO Protocol Extension For Overlay Routing
                   draft-song-alto-overlay-routing-00

Abstract

   This document describes an ALTO protocol extension for overlay
   routing.  It considers three different methods to route traffic from
   a data source to a data receiver, which are direct Internet routing,
   VPN tunnel, and overlay routing via intermediate/relay node(s),
   analyze their use cases in real world and then proposes an extension
   to ALTO protocol so as to support a ALTO client to get cost value
   between hosts via these different routing methods.

1.  Introduction

   ALTO protocol [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol]provides an interface to
   applications with appropriate information to guide an optimal node
   selection based on the Internet service provider's policy when there
   are more than one application nodes providing the same service.  It
   usually aggregates network locations into PIDs, and assigns lower
   cost value for a PID pair that are topologically close.  So when
   application node follows the advice from ALTO server to choose one
   resource provider with a PID that has lower cost from its own PID,
   with higher probability the application node can keep the content
   request and response traffic flow intra domain, which can reduce the
   suffering increasing interdomain traffic for ISPs, and avoid the
   congestion in the backbone network.  More factors for node selection
   can be considered, such as pricing, congestion, and etc.

   The existing ALTO protocol has its limitations.  For example, in a
   cost map it only gives one cost value between source PID and
   destination PID, assuming there is only one path between them.  But
   it can be routed through different paths in overlay routing.  So we
   propose to add a "via" parameter as an extension to the cost map.  In
   this document, we give use cases first, and then the possible way to
   extend the ALTO protocol to achieve it.

   An overlay network is a computer network which is built on the top of
   another network.  Nodes in the overlay can be thought of as being

   connected by virtual or logical links, each of which corresponds to a
   path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying
   network[overlay_network].  One example of overlay netwok over IP
   network is CDN network.  A CDN network consists of many CDN nodes
   with different levels.  One edge CDN node often needs to pull content
   from another node that is in a higher distribution level position in
   the CDN topology.  There usually can be several paths to send the
   content from the source CDN node to the edge CDN node.  One way
   obviously is the direct IP routing.  And if the direct routing path
   is not good, then the source CDN node will select another CDN node as
   the intermediate node to transport the content to the that
   destination edge node, which will be more efficiency than the direct
   routing path.  Of course, there are usually more than one
   intermediate node available, and the source CDN node needs to select
   a "best" one.

   In some cases, there can also be a VPN tunnel between two CDN nodes,
   or between two different data center locations to transfer data.
   Note that in this document, the VPN refers to the VPN service
   provided by the Internet Service Provider, which is used to guarantee
   the quality of delivery service.  The service/content providers often
   classify the data into delay-sensitive and delay-insensitive, Because
   VPN tunnel is more expensive than the direct Internet routing method,
   and at the same time has higher QoS guarantee than the direct
   Internet routing method.  The delay-sensitive data is usually
   transported via the VPN tunnel and the delay-insensitive data can be
   transported over the VPN tunnel if there is available capability for
   it, but can also be transported over the direct Internet routing
   method in order to leave VPN capability for delay-sensitive data.
   The overlay routing method via intermediate nodes (can be an
   intermediate CDN server, a data center gateway and etc.) is an
   optimization to the direct Internet routing method, thus the QoS is a
   little higher than the direct Internet routing method, but it is not
   as good as a VPN tunnel.

   So the transport between two Internet hosts can be from:

      direct Internet routing

      one/more intermediate overlay nodes

      a VPN tunnel

   In this document, we propose a new overlay routing cost service for
   ALTO protocol, which can be used by the ALTO client to compare the
   routing cost through different paths between two Internet hosts.  As
   it is not usually to use two or more relay nodes, we do not consider
   that in this document.  Actually, if there are two or more relay
   nodes, it can be considered as multiple one relay node and use the
   service provided by this document multiple times to solve the issue.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  The
   concepts and data formats are consistent with ALTO protocol base
   document

   . [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol]

3.  Overlay Routing Cost Service Extension

   The reader is assumped to read ALTO protocol before this document,
   especially section 8 of ALTO protocol.

   The Overlay Routing Cost Service provides information about costs
   between individual endpoints through direct Internet routing, VPN or
   overlay routing.

3.1.  Overlay Routing Cost

   An Overlay Routing Cost resource provides information about costs
   between individual endpoints from different paths.

3.1.1.  Media Type

   The media type of Overlay Routing Cost is "application/alto-
   overlayroutingcost+json".

3.1.2.  HTTP Method

   The Overlay Routing Cost resource is requested using the HTTP POST
   method.

3.1.3.  Accept Input Parameters

   An ALTO Client supplies the overlay routing cost parameters through a
   media tyep "application/alto-overlayroutingcostparams+json", with an
   HTTP POST entity body of a JSON Object of type
   ReqOverlayRoutingCostMap:

   object {
     CostType          cost-type;
     [JSONString       constraints<0..*>;]
     EndpointFilter    endpoints;
   } ReqOverlayRoutingCostMap;

   object  {

Internet-Draft               Overlay Routing                October 2013


     TypedEndpointAddr  srcs<0..*>;
     TypedEndpointAddr  dstc<0..*>;
     JSONBool drr;
     JSONBool vpn;
     [TypedEndpointAddr relays<0..*>;]
   } EndpointFilter;


   with fields:

   cost-type The Cost Type (Section 10.7 of ALTO protocol ) to use for
   returned costs.  The cost-metric and cost-mode fields MUST match one
   of the supported Cost Types indicated in this resource's
   capabilities.  The ALTO Client SHOULD omit the description field, and
   if present, the ALTO Server MUST ignore the description field.

   constraints Defined equivalently to the "constraints" input parameter
   of a Filtered Cost Map (see Section 11.3.2 of ALTO protocol).

   endpoints A list of endpoints including source endpoints, relay
   endpoints and destination endpoints for which path costs are to be
   returned.  If "drr" is true, the ALTO server MUST provide the cost of
   direct Internet routing from the source endpoint to the destination
   endpoint.  If the value provided by a ALTO Client for "vpn" is true
   and a provider's VPN is existed between a source and destination
   endpoints pairs, the ALTO server MUST provide the cost of using the
   VPN tunnel.  If the value provided by a ALTO Client for "vpn" is
   true, but the ALTO server cannot find the VPN information between any
   source and destination endpoints, it MUST ignore it.  The ALTO server
   MUST provide the cost from source endpoints to destination endpoints
   through each relay node that is listed in the relay node array.  If
   the list of Source or Destination Endpoints is empty (or not
   included), the ALTO Server MUST interpret it as if it contained the
   Endpoint Address corresponding to the client IP address from the
   incoming connection (see Section 13.3 for discussion and
   considerations regarding this mode).  The Source and Destination
   Endpoint lists MUST NOT be both empty.  The relay node list can be
   empty.  Note that ALTO client SHOULD NOT set "drr" to true, "vpn" to
   false and the relay node list to empty in a single request, in that
   case, the ALTO client should use Endpoint Cost Service.

3.1.4.  Capabilities

   In this document, we define OverlayRoutingCostCapabilities the same
   as FilteredCostMapCapabilities.  See Section 11.3.2.4 of ALTO
   protocol.

3.1.5.  Uses

   None.

3.1.6.  Response

   The "meta" field of an Overlay Routing Cost response MUST include the
   "cost-type" key, to indicate the Cost Type used.

   The data component of an Overlay Routing Cost response is named
   "overlay-routing-cost-map", which is a JSON object of type
   OverlayRoutingCostMapData:

   object  {
     [OverlayRoutingCostMapData overlay-routing-cost-map;]
     [EndpointTwoLevelCosts vpncost;]
     [EndpointTwoLevelCosts drrcost;]
   }  InfoResourceOverlayRoutingCostMap : ResponseEntityBase;

   object-map  {
   TypedEndpointAddr -> EndpointTwoLevelCosts;
   } OverlayRoutingCostMapData;

   object-map {
     TypedEndpointAddr -> EndpointOneLevelCosts;
   } EndpointTwoLevelCosts;

   object-map {
     TypedEndpointAddr -> JSONValue;
   } EndpointOneLevelCosts;


   Specifically, an OverlayRoutingCostMapData object is a dictionary map
   with each key representing a TypedEndpointAddrr string identifying
   the Source Endpoint specified in the input parameters, and for each
   Source Endpoint, a EndpointTwoLevelCosts dictionary map object has
   each key respresenting a TypedEndpointAddr identifying the
   Destination Endpoint, and for each Destination Endpoint, a
   EndpointOneLevelCosts dictionary map object denotes the associated
   cost with each relay nodes specified in the input parameters.

   The key "vpncost" is a dictionary map with each key respresenting a
   TypedEndpointAddr string identifying the Source Endpoint specified in
   the input parameters, and for each Source Endpoint, a
   EndpointOneLeveCost dictionary map object denotes the associated VPN
   cost to each Destination Endpoint if existed.  So the vpncost may
   only contain a few values where there are VPN tunnels between source
   endpoints and destination endpoints.

   The key "drrcost" is a dictionary map with each key respresenting a
   TypedEndpointAddr string identifying the Source Endpoint specified in
   the input parameters, and for each Source Endpoint, a
   EndpointOneLeveCost dictionary map object denotes the associated cost
   to each Destination Endpoint.

   Note that ALTO server SHOULD NOT provide only a single direct routing
   cost map.
