1.  Introduction

   Growing availability of intelligent mobile devices and mature
   networks of operators providing both reliable carrier grade
   connectivity and affordable high bandwidth access offer to the
   customer a nice climate of mobile broadband.  With widespread
   availability and easy usability of mobile broadband, mobile broadband
   applications become more ubiquitous.  Subscribers demand for various
   service applications, especially Internet applications, such as
   mobile Internet video, mobile Internet real-time communication, etc.

   The subscribers requirements lay the foundation of mobile broadband.
   On the other hand, simultaneously, the subscribers' services promote
   the evolution of mobile broadband, which will impact the network
   architecture.  The flourishing mobile applications demand more and
   more bandwidth offered by the operators.  Even with wireless networks
   becoming mature, such as 3G and LTE, the average bandwidth offered is
   not comparable to data rates offered by fixed networks.  With data
   services rapidly increasing, the traditional cellular network
   operating at a shared medium and thus being limited in transmission
   rate often becomes the bottle-neck of mobile broadband.  In addition
   radio network technology generally requires high capital investment
   and operational expenditures.  Cellular network operators are facing
   the challenge of increasing traffic demand at decreasing revenue and
   have to provide means of more cost efficient access technology in a
   highly competitive environment.  The trend of offloading the traffic
   to fixed broadband network is emerging.  Mobile industry has
   specified functionalities to offload the data traffic to the fixed
   broadband (FBB) network, via WLAN or a Home (e)NodeB (HNB or eNodeB,
   aka.  Femtocell) [TR23.829], which could alleviate traffic pressure
   on the mobile network.  That is to say, today, operators are able to
   employ mechanisms to manage the subscriber service over both the
   mobile and the fixed broadband network.  We can say, FMC is emerging
   on the basis of subscribers and operators requirements.

   Fixed Mobile Convergence is a technology trend which aims to provide
   the subscribers access to services regardless of the access network
   type they are connecting to and provide the operators with the
   flexibility to ensure transparency of services to the end user.  For
   a mobile subscriber to access services over both mobile and fixed
   broadband networks seamlessly, additionally, the subscriber's end-to-
   end service level agreement (SLA) must be maintained.  This is
   achieved by interworking the control planes of the fixed broadband
   network and the mobile network.

   In the FMC interworking scenario addressed here, the fixed broadband
   network must partner with the mobile network to perform
   authorisation, authentication, and accounting (AAA) and acquire the

   policies for the mobile subscriber.  Please note, a single converged
   control plane, used for both the fixed broadband and the mobile
   network, may be used in a truely converged, i.e. integrated
   convergence scenario.  This document only focuses on the interworking
   scenario in this version.  The convergence scenario is for further
   study.

   Figure 1 shows the assumed reference architecture of Fixed Mobile
   Convergence Interworking for a Mobile (3GPP) Network and a fixed non-
   3GPP access network as proposed by 3GPP and BroadBand Forum (BBF) as
   an example in document [TR203].

   The policy and charging control (PCC) system is an important element
   in FMC architecture.  PCC system of FMC consists of policy decision
   point (PCRF in the mobile network and BPCF in the fixed broadband
   network) and the policy enforcement point (PGW and BNG,
   respectively), shown in Figure 1.  PCC should support for controlling

   the QoS (e.g., QoS class and bit rates) authorized for service, and
   IP flow based charging.  In FMC interworking scenario, these services
   can be divided into four types.

   1.  Service via macrocell wireless network

   2.  Service via WiFi/Femtocell access routed back to 3GPP Evolved
       Packet Core (EPC), where the fixed broadband network is used as
       the access network,

       *  The service from a mobile UE is connected to WiFi or to
          Femtocell Access Point (FAP) at the residential gateway (RG),
          routed back to 3GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC).

   3.  Services via WiFi access only fixed broadband routed

       *  The service from a mobile UE is connected to WiFi without
          traversing the mobile network.

       *  In this scenario, the UE service may be guaranteed based on
          subscriber's policy from the mobile network.

   4.  LIPA/SIPTO traffic

       *  Support of Local IP access (LIPA) and of Selected IP traffic
          offload (SIPTO) for the Home (e)NodeB Subsystem and for the
          macro layer network include a more integrated FMC scenario and
          thus are for further study.

   As for the services stated above, only the second and the third type
   are related to FMC, where both the fixed broadband and the mobile
   network are involved.  The FMC architecture shall be capable to set
   operator policies to support simultaneous access to these service.

   In the network today, deploying FMC is a worthy way for operators to
   satisfy subscriber's requirement and ease pressure from bandwidth.
   In the following sections, we first describe the motivation and then
   discuss the key issues that are at this time limited to the Intarea
   and to FMC interworking scenario.

3.  Key Issues in Fixed Mobile Converged Interworking

   There is a need to highlight and discuss the issues when facilitating
   FMC.  We systematically analyze the issues that have been proposed so
   far and briefly assess the possible protocol extensions which could
   solve the problems.  In the network architecture, we target and limit
   the scope to the interworking architecture for FMC.

   Regarding the traffic management and control requirements in FMC
   interworking scenario, these are the issues from an IETF Internet
   Area and fixed broadband network point of view.

   1.  UE identification in fixed broadband network

   2.  UE mobility status reporting in fixed broadband network

   3.  Transportation of UE link characteristics in fixed broadband
       network.

   There are many standardization issues related to FMC and protocol
   extension work needed are stated in this document.  If these issues
   are fixed, the advantages brought out will be:

   1.  Optimize traffic management (per-UE granularity in the fixed
       broadband network)

   2.  Enhance device management (via IP address synchronization between
       fixed broadband network and mobile network)

   3.  Quick Responsiveness based on UE status

   These issues are elaborated in the sections that follow.


4.  UE identification  in Fixed Broadband Network

   Nowadays, a subscriber is always provided with a single private IPv4
   address at their home or small business, which should reduce the
   pressure on the available public IPv4 addresses which are now
   exhausted.  For instance, in the fixed broadband network, each host
   within the local network will be assigned a private IPv4 address,
   then NA(P)T function is responsible for translating the private IPv4
   address to the public IPv4 address assigned to the CPE (Customer
   Premises Equipment) by operators, and vice versa.

   As a result of maintaining growth of IPv4 service, private addressing
   plan will require address sharing, which will cause issues for
   operators, such as traffic management, QoS enforcement, etc. in the



Xue, et al.              Expires April 18, 2013                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                 PS for FMC                   October 2012


   FMC scenarios, where the policy control must be based on the
   fundamental concept of per-UE granularity.  Note that ultimately,
   deploying IPv6 without NA(P)T function is the only perennial way to
   ease pressure on the public IPv4 address without the need for address
   sharing mechanisms that give rise to the issues identified herein.
   But in the interim, however, IPv4 services are also very important
   for end-users, and service providers, which can not be ignored.

   Consider Figure 2 where several UEs are connected to the same RG in a
   fixed broadband network in an address sharing scheme.  Each UE is
   assigned a private IPv4 address which are shared by RG private/public
   Wide Area Network (WAN) interface IPv4 address.  Problems are
   introduced because of address sharing via NA(P)T and UEs
   identification or Host Identifier (HOST_ID) needs to be communicated
   to fixed broadband network nodes such as the edge router (BNG) or
   Traffic Detection function (TDF) [RFC6269].

   In FMC network, it is assumed that fixed broadband network manages
   the traffic in per-UE granularity.  The important consideration is
   that today's PCC (including QoS control and IP flow based charging)
   must be based on the concept of IP Connectivity Access Network (IP-
   CAN) in per-UE granularity.  IP-CAN session [TS23.203] is the
   association between a UE and an IP network.

   Obviously, the fixed broadband network and mobile network must
   support inter-operator subscribers policy exchange, this introduces a
   major challenge on how to coordinate UE identification across the
   operators' domains so that the mobile network can inform the suitable
   policy to the serving fixed broadband access network that its mobile
   user equipment (UE) is attached to so that the fixed broadband
   network can provide the appropriate FMC interworking policy and
   bearer control on UE's traffic.

   There may be limitations with BNG implementations with respect to the
   level of granularity (per-UE) of the enforcement.  A key problem is
   to identify offloaded traffic from a UE behind the NA(P)T embedded
   into RG.  There is no longer a unique IP address per UE, in addition,
   the UDP port behind NA(P)T is not bound to the special UE.

   Another problem that arises is efficient packet inspection.
   Operators expect the fixed broadband network could be configured in
   such a way that the traffic subject to packet inspection is routed
   via the Traffic Detection Function (TDF) [TS29.212], otherwise, the
   traffic that is not subject to packet inspection may bypass the TDF.
   This assumption only holds if it is possible to identify individual
   UEs behind NA(P)T in fixed broadband network, shown in Figure 2.

          RG with

            Figure 2: UE's Identification in Broadband Network

   As discussed before, there are many drivers for the identification of
   the host or UE when an IP (v4 or v6) address is shared among several
   users in the broadband network.  They include efficient packet
   inspection, QoS enforcement, charging.  We can note that all these
   functions in FMC depend on being able to identify UEs behind the
   NA(P)T functionality.

   There are several possibilities which provide solutions.  There are
   several possible IP, ICMP (both v4 and v6) or TCP/UDP protocol
   extensions, discussed in [I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis].
   Additionally, there may be other possibilities, such as some other
   new identifier to be defined as the host identifier to be passed by
   the subscriber to a server such as BNG or TDF.  It is difficult to
   foresee which is the suitable solution, more work needs to be done.

   There are also several possibilities which provide link layer
   solutions.  Using VLANs or link layer address/ MAC address of the UE
   provide the necessary identification for the UE.  Link layer
   solutions to UE identification are left out of scope.


5.  UE Mobility in Fixed Broadband Network

   The users are the mobile subscribers in FMC.  Note that all the
   services depend on the substantive character of subscriber's
   mobility.  It is important for operators to capture the user device
   when it is moving into or outside the network, even in WiFi access.
   Besides, the application and service from the subscriber must be
   guaranteed based on the policy of operators.

Internet-Draft                 PS for FMC                   October 2012


   In mobile network today, there are many mature solutions offered for
   user's mobility already.  Herein, only mobility in fixed access,
   i.e., WiFi access, will be considered.  For example, the user device
   is attached to the home LAN (e.g., WiFi ) network, and establishes a
   connection back to the subscriber's mobile service provider network
   via the fixed broadband network.  The mobile operator should
   cooperate with the broadband access operator to deliver proper policy
   for the service from UE.

                Figure 3: UE Mobility in Broadband Network

   The mobility considered in the fixed access does not consider the use
   of a mobility protocol.  Consider Figure 3 where there are many
   mobile nodes, i.e.  UEs connected to the fixed braodband network.
   Status of these nodes at a given time needs to be communicated to the
   network by the access points.  In this section, we divide the
   mobility status reporting capability into two cases:

   1.  UE is moving into or outside the coverage area of WiFi AP

   2.  UE's WiFi access is dormant or not.

   Figure 3 shows an example of the scenario where mobile UEs are served
   in WiFi deployment over the fixed broadband network.  RG embeds WiFi
   AP and NA(P)T function.  Each UE is provided with a single private
   IPv4 address assigned within the local network.  NA(P)T in RG is
   responsible for translating the private IPv4 address to the public
   IPv4 address assigned by the fixed operator.

   BPCF in fixed broadband network must have partnership with PCRF in

   mobile network in order to maintain the service level agreement
   (SLA).  In order to allow the PCRF to retrieve the UE's policy to be
   passed onto the BPCF in the fixed broadband network, it is mainly
   concerned about the traffic and UE identification binding used to
   achieve the actual traffic control.  The BPCF/BNG will perform the
   policy control based on the binding.

   Based on the UE's mobility, problems will arise.  For example, the
   PCRF will download the policy to the BPCF when UE first attaches the
   AP after the UE is authenticated and an IP address/prefix is
   assigned.  Consider the two UEs, shown in Figure 3.  UE1 and UE2 are
   assigned different private/public IP addresses within the local
   network, IP1 and IP2 respectively.  BPCF/BNG will perform the
   admission control and policy enforcement on the UE1 and UE2 traffic.

   Since plenty of UEs may move into the coverage of WiFi AP, it is
   possible that large amount of resources will be needed at the BPCF/
   BNG. for optimum operation, the resources need to be released when
   the UE goes out of the coverage of WiFi AP.  So timely detection of
   UE detachments is crucial in fixed mobile convergence environments.
   That is to say the configuration must be updated regularly to satisfy
   that the WiFi AP can serve thousands of UEs and proper resource
   allocation at the BPCF/BNG.

   Possible solutions approaches include extending the Control And
   Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) architecture RFC 5415
   [RFC5415].  Access Controllers using an extended protocol can be
   charged to keep track of the mobility status of the UEs that are
   connected to the fixed broadband network using IEEE 802.11 links.
   However, in Fixed Mobile Convergence, this information is needed by
   entities not necessarily co-located with the Access Controller.

   In some cases, e.g. home networks, CAPWAP protocol is not commonly
   used.  In such cases, it becomes even more challenging to keep track
   of the UE mobility status.  Protocol solutions need to be developed
   to solve this problem.  During the solution process, CAPWAP protocol
   could be used as an example.


6.  IANA Considerations

7.  Security Considerations

   Serious concern of mobile operators towards FMC approaches has been
   the customer access via networks not under control of the operator.

   Operators would like to keep their own high security measures to
   prevent various kinds of fraud or attack to the operators services
   and network entities.  Well known risks and vulnerabilities which are
   common to any NA(P)T application are documented in the NAT
   specification [RFC2663].  Any additional security considerations
   arising from FMC are TBD.
