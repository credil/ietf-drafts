   1. Introduction 

      Path diversity is a well-known requirement from Service Providers. 
      Such diversity is required to ensure Label-Switched Path (LSPs) 
      may be established without sharing resources, thus greatly 
      reducing the probability of simultaneous connection failures.  

      When route computation for paths that need to be diverse is 
      performed at the LSP's source node, this requirement can be met by 
      a local decision at that node. However, there are scenarios when 
      route computations are performed by remote nodes, there is a need 
      for relevant diversity requirements to be communicated to those 
      nodes. These include (but are not limited to): 

      .  LSPs with loose hops in the Explicit Route Object (ERO), e.g. 
        inter-domain LSPs.   

      .  Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User-
        Network Interface (UNI) where route computation may be 
        performed by the (server layer) core node [RFC4208]; 

      [RFC4874] introduced a means of specifying nodes and resources to 
      be excluded from a route, using the eXclude Route Object (XRO) and 
      Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject (EXRS).  

      [RFC4874] facilitates the calculation of diverse routes for LSPs 
      based on known properties of those paths including addresses of 
      links and nodes traversed, and Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) of 
      traversed links. This requires that these properties of the 
      path(s) from which diversity is required be known to the source 
      node which initiates signaling. However, there are circumstances 
      under which this may not be possible or desirable, including (but 
      not limited to): 

      .  Exclusion of a path which does not originate, terminate or 
         traverse the source node signaling the diverse LSP, in which 
         case the addresses and SRLGs of the path from which diversity 
         is required are unknown to the source node.  

      .  Exclusion of a path which, while known at the source node of 
         the diverse LSP, has incomplete or unavailable route 
         information, e.g. due to confidentiality of the path

         attributes. In other words, the scenario in which the reference 
         path is hosted by the source / requesting node but the 
         properties required to construct an XRO object are not known to 
         source / requesting node. Inter-domain and GMPLS overlay 
         networks may present such restrictions.  

      .  If the source node knows the route of the reference path from 
         which diversity is required, it can use this information to 
         construct an XRO and send it in the path message during the 
         signaling of a diverse LSP. However, if the route of the 
         excluded path changes (e.g. due to re-optimization or failure 
         in the network), the source node would need to change the 
         diverse path to ensure that it remains diverse from the 
         excluded path. It is preferable to have this decision made by 
         the node that performed the path-calculation for the diverse 
         path. For example, in the case of GMPLS-UNI, it is better to 
         have such responsibility at the server layer as opposed to at 
         the client layer so that the diversity requirements are 
         transparent to the client layer. Furthermore, in all networking 
         scenarios, if the node performing the route computation/ 
         expansion is aware of the diversity requirements of the two 
         paths, it may consider joint re-optimization of the diverse 
         paths.  

      This document addresses such scenarios and defines procedures 
      that may be used to exclude the route taken by a particular LSP, 
      or the routes taken by all LSPs belonging to a single tunnel. 
      Note that this diversity requirement is different from the 
      diversity requirements of path protection where both the 
      reference and diverse LSPs belong to the same tunnel. The 
      diversity requirements considered in this document do not require 
      that the paths in question belonging to the same tunnel or share 
      the same source or destination node.  

      The means by which the node calculating or expanding the route of 
      the signaled LSP discovers the route of the path(s) from which 
      the signaled LSP requires diversity are beyond the scope of this 
      document.  

      This document addresses only the exclusion of point-to-point 
      paths; point-to-multipoint paths will be addressed in a future 
      version. 

      If mutually diverse routes are desired for two LSPs belonging to 
      different tunnels, it is recommended that they be signaled with 
      XRO LSP subobjects referencing each other. The processing rules 
      specified in this document cover this case.

   2. RSVP-TE signaling extensions 

      This section describes the signaling extensions required to 
      address the aforementioned requirements. Specifically, this 
      document defines a new LSP subobject to be signaled in the 
      EXCLUDE_ROUTE object (XRO) and/ or Explicit Exclusion Route 
      Subobject (EXRS) defined in [RFC4874]. Inclusion of the LSP 
      subobject in any other RSVP object is not defined.  

   2.1. Terminology 

      In this document, the following terminology is adopted: 

      Excluded path: the path from which diversity is required. 

      Diverse LSP: the LSP being signaled with XRO/ EXRS containing the 
      path subobject referencing the excluded path(s).  

      Processing node: the node performing a path-calculation involving 
      an exclusion specified in an XRO or EXRS. 

      Destination node: in the context of an XRO, this is the 
      destination of the LSP being signaled. In the context of an EXRS, 
      the destination node is the last explicit node to which the loose 
      hop is expanded. 

      Penultimate node: in the context of an XRO, this is the 
      penultimate hop of the LSP being signaled. In the context of an 
      EXRS, the penultimate node is the penultimate node of the loose 
      hop undergoing expansion. 

   2.2. Path XRO Subobjects 

      New IPv4 and IPv6 Point-to-Point (P2P) Path XRO subobjects are 
      defined by this document as follows. 

   2.2.1. IPv4 Point-to-Point Path subobject

        L 
             The L-flag is used as for the other XRO subobjects defined 
             in [RFC4874]. 
              
             0 indicates that the attribute specified MUST be excluded.  
              
             1 indicates that the attribute specified SHOULD be 
             avoided.

             IPv4 Point-to-Point Path subobject 
                       (to be assigned by IANA; suggested value: 36). 
         

        Length 

            The length contains the total length of the subobject in 
            bytes, including the type and length fields. The length is 
            always 24. 

        Attribute Flags 

            The Attribute Flags are used to communicate desirable 
            attributes of the LSP being signaled. The following flags 
            are defined. None, all or multiple attribute flags MAY be 
            set within the same subobject.  

            0x01 = LSP ID to be ignored 

               This flag is used to indicate tunnel level exclusion. 
               Specifically, this flag is used to indicate that the 
               lsp-id field of the subobject is to be ignored and the

               exclusion applies to any LSP matching the rest of the 
               supplied FEC.  

            0x02 = Destination node exception 

               This flag is used to indicate that the destination node 
               of the LSP being signaled MAY be shared with the 
               excluded path even when this violates the exclusion 
               flags.  

            0x04 = Processing node exception 

               This flag is used to indicate that the processing node 
               MAY be shared with the excluded path even when this 
               violates the exclusion flags.  

            0x08 = Penultimate node exception 

               This flag is used to indicate that the penultimate node 
               of the LSP being signaled MAY be shared with the 
               excluded path even when this violates the exclusion 
               flags.  

        Exclusion Flags  
         
             The Exclusion-Flags are used to communicate desirable 
             types of exclusion. The following flags are defined.   
    
             0x01 = SRLG exclusion 
               
                  This flag is used to indicate that the route of the 
                  LSP being signaled is requested to be SRLG diverse 
                  from the excluded path specified by the LSP 
                  subobject.  
                   
             0x02 = Node exclusion 
              
                  This flag is used to indicate that the route of the 
                  LSP being signaled is requested to be node diverse 
                  from the excluded path specified by the LSP 
                  subobject.  

                  (Note: the meaning of this flag may be modified by 
                  the value of the Attribute-flags.)

             avoided.  
    
        Type  
         
             IPv6 Point-to-Point Path subobject 
                       (to be assigned by IANA; suggested value: 37). 
         

        Length 

            The length contains the total length of the subobject in 
            bytes, including the type and length fields. The length is 
            always 48. 

      The Attribute Flags and Exclusion Flags are as defined for the 
      IPv4 Point-to-Point LSP XRO subobject. 

      The remaining fields are as defined in [RFC3209]. 
       
    
   2.3. Processing rules for the Path XRO subobjects 

      XRO processing as described in [RFC4874] is unchanged. 

      If the processing node is the destination for the LSP being 
      signaled, it SHOULD NOT process a Path XRO subobject. 

      If the L-flag is not set, the processing node follows the 
      following procedure:  

      -  The processing node MUST ensure that any route calculated for 
         the signaled LSP respects the requested exclusion flags with 
         respect to the excluded path referenced by the subobject, 
         including local resources.  

      -  If the processing node fails to find a route that meets the 
         requested constraint, the processing node MUST return a PathErr 
         with the error code "Routing Problem" (24) and error sub-code 
         "Route blocked by Exclude Route" (67). 

      -  If the excluded path referenced in the LSP subobject is 
         unknown to the processing node, the processing node SHOULD 
         ignore the LSP subobject in the XRO and SHOULD proceed with the 
    
    
   Ali, Swallow, Filsfils, et al   Expires July 2013          [Page 10] 
          Internet Draft      draft-ietf-ccamp-lsp-diversity-01.txt 


         signaling request. After sending the Resv for the signaled LSP, 
         the processing node SHOULD return a PathErr with the error code 
         "Notify Error" (25) and error sub-code "Route of XRO path 
         unknown" (value to be assigned by IANA, suggested value: 13) 
         for the signaled LSP.  

      If the L-flag is set, the processing node follows the following 
      procedure:  

      -  The processing node SHOULD respect the requested exclusion 
         flags with respect to the excluded path as far as possible.  

      -  If the processing node fails to find a route that meets the 
         requested constraint, it SHOULD proceed with signaling using a 
         suitable route that meets the constraint as far as possible. 
         After sending the Resv for the signaled LSP, it SHOULD return a 
         PathErr message with error code "Notify Error" (25) and error 
         sub-code "Failed to respect Exclude Route" (value: to be 
         assigned by IANA, suggest value: 14) to the source node.  

      -  If the excluded path referenced in the LSP subobject is 
         unknown to the processing node, the processing node SHOULD 
         ignore the LSP subobject in the XRO and SHOULD proceed with the 
         signaling request. After sending the Resv for signaled LSP, the 
         processing node SHOULD return a PathErr message with the error 
         code "Notify Error" (25) and error sub-code "Route of XRO path 
         unknown" for the signaled LSP.  

      If, subsequent to the initial signaling of a diverse LSP: 

      -   an excluded path referenced in the diverse LSP's XRO 
         subobject becomes known to the processing node (e.g. when the 
         excluded path is signaled), or  

      -   A change in the excluded path becomes known to the processing 
         node,  

      the processing node SHOULD re-evaluate the exclusion and 
      diversity constraints requested by the diverse LSP to determine 
      whether they are still satisfied. 

      -   If the requested exclusion constraints for the diverse LSP 
         are no longer satisfied and an alternative route for the 
         diverse LSP that can satisfy those constraints exists, the 
         processing node SHOULD send a PathErr message for the diverse 
         LSP with the error code "Notify Error" (25) and error sub-code 
         "Preferable path exists" (6). A source node receiving a PathErr

         message with this error code and sub-code combination MAY try 
         to reoptimize the diverse tunnel to the new compliant path. 

      -   If the requested exclusion constraints for the diverse LSP 
         are no longer satisfied and no alternative path for the diverse 
         LSP that can satisfy those constraints exists, then: 

           o If the L-flag was not set in the original exclusion, the 
              processing node MUST send a PathErr message for the 
              diverse LSP with the error code "Routing Problem" (24) and 
              error sub-code "Route blocked by Exclude Route" (67). The 
              PSR flag SHOULD NOT be set. 

           o If the L-flag was set in the original exclusion, the 
              processing node SHOULD send a PathErr message for the 
              diverse LSP with the error code error code "Notify Error" 
              (25) and error sub-code "Failed to respect Exclude Route" 
              (value: to be assigned by IANA, suggest value: 14). 

      The following rules apply whether or not the L-flag is set:  

      -  An XRO object MAY contain multiple path subobjects.  

      -  As specified in [RFC4874], a node receiving a Path message 
         carrying an XRO MAY reject the message if the XRO is too large 
         or complicated for the local implementation or the rules of 
         local policy. In this case, the node MUST send a PathErr 
         message with the error code "Routing Error" (24) and error sub-
         code "XRO Too Complex" (68).  A source node receiving this 
         error code/sub-code combination MAY reduce the complexity of 
         the XRO or route around the node that rejected the XRO. 

      -  A source node receiving a PathErr message with the error code 
         "Notify Error" (25) and error sub-codes "Route of XRO path 
         unknown" or "Failed to respect Exclude Route" MAY take no 
         action. 

      -  The attribute-flags affect the processing of the XRO subobject 
         as follows: 

           o  When the "LSP ID to be ignored" flag is set, the 
             processing node MUST calculate a route based on exclusions 
             from the routes of all known LSPs matching the tunnel-id, 
             source, destination and extended tunnel-id specified in 
             the subobject. When this flag is not set, the lsp-id is 
             not ignored and the exclusion applies only to the 
             specified LSP (i.e., LSP level exclusion).

          Internet Draft      draft-ietf-ccamp-lsp-diversity-01.txt 


           o  When the "destination node exception" flag is not set, the 
             exclusion flags SHOULD also be respected for the 
             destination node. 

           o  When the "processing node exception" flag is not set, the 
             exclusion flags SHOULD also be respected for the 
             processing node.  

           o  When the "penultimate node exception" flag is not set, the 
             exclusion flags SHOULD also be respected for the 
             penultimate node. 

   2.4. Path EXRS Subobject 

      [RFC4874] defines the EXRS ERO subobject. An EXRS is used to 
      identify abstract nodes or resources that must not or should not 
      be used on the path between two inclusive abstract nodes or 
      resources in the explicit route. An EXRS contains one or more 
      subobjects of its own, called EXRS subobjects [RFC4874]. 

      An EXRS MAY include an IPv4 Point-to-Point (P2P) Path subobject 
      as specified in section 2.2.1. In this case, the EXRS format 
      would be as follows: 

      0                   1                   2                   3

      The meaning of respective fields in EXRS header is as defined in 
      [RFC4874]. The meaning of respective fields in IPv4 P2P Path

      subobject is as defined earlier in this document. This is with 
      the exceptions that:  

      -  The processing node exception applies to the node processing 
         the ERO.  

      -  If the L bit in the ERO header is not set (ERO.L = 0), the 
         IPv4 P2P Path subobject is processed against the path(s) for 
         which the processing node is a source, destination or transit 
         node. 

      -  The penultimate node exception applies to the penultimate node 
         of the loose hop. This flag is only processed if the ERO.L bit 
         is set, i.e. in the loose ERO hop case.  

      -  The destination node exception applies to the last explicit 
         node to which the loose hop is expanded. This flag is only 
         processed if ERO.L bit is set, i.e., in the loose ERO hop case.  

   2.4.1. Processing Rules for the EXRS with Path subobject  

      The processing rules for the EXRS object are unchanged from 
      [RFC4874]. When the EXRS contains one or more Path subobject(s), 
      the processing rules specified in Section 2.3 apply to the node 
      processing the ERO with the EXRS subobject.  

      The EXRS scope is limited to the loose hop in which the EXRS 
      appears. If loose-hop expansion results in the creation of 
      another loose-hop in the outgoing ERO, the processing node MAY 
      include the EXRS in the newly-created loose hop for further 
      processing by downstream nodes. 

   3. Security Considerations 

      This document does not introduce any additional security issues 
      above those identified in [RFC5920], [RFC2205], [RFC3209], 
      [RFC3473] and [RFC4874].
