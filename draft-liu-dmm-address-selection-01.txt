                       Address Selection for DMM
                   draft-liu-dmm-address-selection-01

Abstract

   In DMM scenario, it is possible for the MN to have multiple mobility
   anchor points and corresponding prefixes.  In that case, MN needs to
   know the type of the addresses then it can select the right one for
   application to use.  This document describes a mechnism to extend RA
   message to carry a flag which can be used to identify the nature of
   the prefix.

1.  Problem of address selection for DMM

   As draft-liu-dmm-dynamic-anchor-discussion-00 introduced, there is a
   address selection problem for DMM dynamic anchor solution.  The
   difficulty of this problem is: the MN does not know the difference
   between the multiple prefixes.  There is no way for the network to
   tell the MN the nature of the different prefixes and there is no
   standard mechnism for the MN to select the right prefix.


2.  Extension to Router Advertisment

   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] extend IPv6 router advertisement message for
   movement detection and home agent information broadcasting.  This
   document proposes to further extend the IPv6 router advertisement
   message to carry a flag to identify the nature of the prefix that it
   is advertising.

Internet-Draft     draft-liu-dmm-address-selection-00         March 2012


   This document proposes to extend the prefix information option to add
   a 'T' flag, its definition is as follows:

   T (Type):

   Type flag.  This is a 2 bits flag indentifies the types of the
   advertising prefix.  The value of this flag could be:

   00: Local home network prefix.  It means that this prefix is
   allocated and advertised by current router which the MN attaches to.

   01 : Remote home network prefix.  It means that this prefix is
   allocated by another router instead of the router that the MN
   currently attaches to.

   10: Reserved.

   11: Reserved.

   The mechanism that used for the router to identify the types of the
   prefix is out the scope of this document.  As an example, the router
   can query the policy server to know which router allocates a
   particular prefix.


3.  Mobile Node Operation

   The mobile node knows the types of the prefixes from the T flag of
   the router advertisment message.  The applications on the mobile node
   can use this information to select the right IP address.  For
   example, for on-going session, application always choose to use the
   prefix that it used before it handovers to a new location.  For the
   newly initiate application, it will use the prefix that allocated by
   current router, e.g. local home network prefix.  The mobile node can
   use advanced socket API to select the proper prefix, for example,
   extension to RFC 5014.The detail mechanism is out the scope of this
   document.


4.  An Example of How This Draft Works

   This section describes how the T flag specified above solves the
   source address selection.  Two different use cases are presented
   below.

    Figure 1: Source address selection in DMM

   As shown in figure1, flow#1, flow#2 and flow#3 are initiated and
   anchored at MAR1, MAR2 and MAR3 respectively.

   When MN attaches to MAR1, MAR1 sends Router Advertisement
   messages(RA) containing MN's home network prefix(HNP1) in Prefix
   Information option with the Type flag (T) bit set to 00 as specified
   in section 2.  This indicates that HNP1 is local home network prefix
   which is allocated and advertised by current router(MAR1).  MN can
   initiate a session with CN1 (i.e. flow#1 in figure1) by using IPv6

   addresses derived from HNP1.  Common IPv6 routing mechanism will be
   applied for flow#1 as long as MN remains attached to MAR1.

   When MN handoffs to MAR2(flow#1 continues while MN handoffs), MAR2
   sends RA messages containing MN's new prefix(HNP2) in Prefix
   Information option with the Type flag (T) bit set to 00 together with
   old prefix (i.e.  HNP1) with the Type flag (T) bit set to 01.  MN
   will learn that HNP2 is local home network prefix and HNP1 is remote
   home network prefix.  At this moment, MN can initiate a new sessions
   with CN2 (i.e. flow#2 in the figure1) by using IPv6 addresses derived
   from HNP2 as its source address.  Because this IPv6 address is
   derived from a local home network prefix (i.e.  HNP2), common IPv6
   routing mechanism will be applied for flow#2.  For flow#1, MAR1 plays
   role of LMA and MAR2 plays role of MAG.

   When MN handoffs to MAR3(flow#1 and flow#2 continue while MN
   handoffs), MAR3 sends RA messages containing MN's new prefix(HNP3)
   and previous prefixes (HNP1 and HNP2) in Prefix Information option
   with the Type flag (T) bit set to 00 for HNP3 and 01 for HNP1 and
   HNP2.  This indicates HNP3 is local home network prefix, and HNP1 and
   HNP2 are remote home network prefixes.  At this moment, MN can
   initiates new sessions with CN3 (i.e. flow#3 in figure1) by using
   IPv6 addresses derived from HNP3 as its source address.  And Common
   IPv6 routing mechanism will be applied for flow#3.

4.2.  MN Handoffs From MAR Back to Its Previous MAR

   MN could also handoff back from MAR3 to MAR2 again (assuming flow#1,
   flow#2 and flow#3 continue while MN handoffs).

   In this case, as described above, MAR2 will send RA messages
   containing HNP1, HNP2 and HNP3 in Prefix Information option with the
   Type flag (T) bit set to 00 for HNP2 and 01 for HNP1 and HNP3.  This
   indicates HNP2 is local home network prefix, HNP1 and HNP3 are remote
   home network prefixes.

   Assuming that MN initiates a new sessions with a new communication
   node (e.g. with CN4 which is not shown in figure1) by using IPv6
   addresses derived from HNP2 as its source address.  Because this IPv6
   address is derived from a local home network prefix (i.e.  HNP2),
   common IPv6 routing mechanism will be applied for this session.
