    The Generalized Object Encoding (GOE) LDPC-Staircase FEC Scheme
                       draft-roca-rmt-goe-ldpc-00

Abstract

   This document describes a Generalized Object Encoding (GOE) FEC
   Scheme for the protection of one or multiple objects, in the context
   of a Content Delivery Protocol (CDP) like FLUTE/ALC, FCAST/ALC or
   FCAST/NORM.  Unlike [RFC5052], the GOE approach [GOE] decouples the
   definition of Generalized Objects over which FEC encoding takes place
   homogeneously, from the natural source object boundaries.  This
   separation enables either an Unequal Erasure Protection (UEP) of
   different portions of a given source object, or an efficient and
   global protection of a set of potentially small files, depending on
   the way the Generalized Objects are defined.

   The present document defines the GOE LDPC-Staircase FEC Scheme, i.e.,
   the GOE version of the FEC Encoding ID 3 (LDPC-Staircase) defined in
   [RFC5170] with the further restriction that the number of encoding
   symbols per group (i.e., the number of symbols sent in the same
   packet) MUST be equal to 1 (G=1).  This document does not change the
   LDPC-Staircase code definition, and therefore it inherits most of
   [RFC5170].  It only modifies the FEC Payload ID and FEC OTI, i.e., it
   addresses the problem of UEP and efficient file bundle protection by
   means of pure signaling approach.

Internet-Draft      The GOE LDPC-Staircase FEC Scheme       October 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Traditional FEC Schemes, as per [RFC5052]

   The use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes is a classic solution
   to improve the reliability of unicast, multicast and broadcast
   Content Delivery Protocols (CDP) and applications [RFC3453].  The
   [RFC5052] document describes a generic framework to use FEC schemes
   with objects (e.g., files) delivery applications based on the ALC
   [RFC5775] and NORM [RFC5740] reliable multicast transport protocols.

   More specifically, the [RFC5053] (Raptor) and [RFC5170] (LDPC-
   Staircase) FEC schemes introduce erasure codes based on sparse parity
   check matrices for object delivery protocols like ALC and NORM.
   Similarly, the [RFC5510] document introduces Reed-Solomon codes based
   on Vandermonde matrices for the same object delivery protocols.

   The way these FEC schemes is used leads to two limitations.  First of
   all, [RFC5052] defines an approach where the same FEC encoding is
   applied to all the blocks of a given object, i.e., the whole object
   is encoded using the same FEC scheme, with the same target code rate,
   resulting in an equivalent protection.  This approach may not suit
   situations where some subsets of an object deserve a higher erasure
   protection than the others.

   A second limitation is associated to the protection of a large set of
   small objects.  [RFC5052] defines an approach where each object is
   protected individually.  This feature limits the robustness of their
   delivery: since there is a small number of source and repair packets
   for a given small object, a significant number of these packets may
   be erased thereby preventing this object to be decoded at a receiver.
   For instance, if the source and repair packets of a given object are
   transmitted in sequence (which may not be the best strategy), a
   packet erasure burst will significantly impact transmission
   robustness.  Other transmission ordering strategies (e.g., with long
   packet interleavings or random ordering strategies) can reduce the
   impacts of packet erasure bursts, but they do not solve the
   fundamental problem of the protection of small objects.  On the
   opposite a global FEC protection of all the objects of this set,
   using a single FEC encoding (when possible), provides optimal
   transmission robustness, since all the objects can be decoded as long
   as the erasure rate remains lower than the protection brought by the
   FEC code rate.

1.2.  GOE FEC Scheme Principles

   In order to mitigate the limitations of the traditional FEC Schemes,
   a better approach consists in decoupling FEC protection from the

   natural object boundaries.  This is the goal of the Generalized
   Object Encoding (GOE) approach [GOE].  The set of source objects is
   first encoded using the No-Code FEC Scheme [RFC5445].  Each source
   symbol of each source object is therefore individually identified by
   its {TOI (i.e., ALC or NORM object identifier); SBN (source block
   identifier); ESI (symbol identifier)} tupple.  Each Generalized
   Object is then defined as a sequence of consecutive No-Code encoding
   symbols, that starts at a given symbol, identified by its {TOI, SBN,
   ESI} tuple, and that is composed of a given number of such symbols.
   Each Generalized Object is then FEC encoded using an appropriate FEC
   code, with an appropriate code rate.  Of course a Generalized Object
   may be a subset of a given source object or at the opposite may
   encompass several source objects.  The key point when defining
   Generalized Objects is that all the corresponding source symbols
   require an equal erasure protection.

   The GOE approach is independent of the nature of the FEC code, in the
   sense that the general mechanisms it defines is not restricted to a
   single type of FEC code.  On the opposite, the GOE approach can be
   associated to any of the existing FEC schemes, re-using their code
   definition.  However a new FEC Encoding ID value, a new FEC Object
   Transmission Information (FEC OTI) and a new FEC Payload ID (FPI)
   must be defined in order to accommodate the GOE specifics.  This
   means that a dedicated FEC Scheme must be defined.  For instance,
   [GOE] defines the GOE Reed-Solomon FEC Scheme for the particular case
   of Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8) and no encoding symbol group, the
   GOE equivalent to FEC Encoding ID 5 defined in [RFC5510].

   The present document defines the GOE LDPC-Staircase FEC Scheme, i.e.,
   the GOE version of the FEC Encoding ID 3 (LDPC-Staircase) defined in
   [RFC5170], with the further restriction that the number of encoding
   symbols per group (i.e., the number of symbols sent in the same
   packet) MUST be equal to 1 (G=1).

   Please refer to [GOE] for the details on the GOE procedures at a
   sender and at a receiver.  An evaluation of GOE can also be found in
   [GOE.RR7699].  Finally [GOEatIETF81] provides a high level overview
   of GOE.

2.1.  Definitions, Notations and Abbreviations

2.1.1.  Definitions

   This document uses the following terms and definitions.  Some of them
   are FEC scheme specific and are in line with [RFC5052]:
   Source Packet:  a data packet containing only source symbols, that is
      sent over the packet erasure channel.  Most of the time a source
      packet will contain a single source symbol.
   Repair Packet:  a data packet containing only repair symbols, that is
      sent over the packet erasure channel.  Most of the time a repair
      packet will contain a single repair symbol.
   Packet Erasure Channel:  a communication path where packets are
      either dropped (e.g., by a congested router, or because the number
      of transmission errors exceeds the correction capabilities of the
      physical layer codes) or received.  When a packet is received, it
      is assumed that this packet is not corrupted.
   Systematic code:  FEC code in which the source symbols are part of
      the encoding symbols.  The Reed-Solomon codes introduced in this
      document are systematic.
   Code rate:  the k/n ratio, i.e., the ratio between the number of
      source symbols and the number of encoding symbols.  By definition,
      the code rate is such that: 0 < code rate <= 1.  A code rate close
      to 1 indicates that a small number of repair symbols have been
      produced during the encoding process.
   Object:  the object (e.g., file) submitted to the CDP by the user.
   Generalized Object:  a group of consecutive source symbols, that
      belong to one or several objects (as defined above) and that are
      considered together for the purpose of a GOE scheme.  Generalized
      objects may be a subset of a given object or at the opposite
      encompass several objects.  The key point when defining
      generalized objects is that all the source symbols of a
      generalized object require an equal erasure protection.
   Source symbol:  unit of data used during the encoding process.  In
      this specification, there is always one source symbol per ADU.
   Encoding symbol:  unit of data generated by the encoding process.
      With systematic codes, source symbols are part of the encoding
      symbols.
   Repair symbol:  encoding symbol that is not a source symbol.
   Source block:  a block of k source symbols that are considered
      together for the encoding.

          block.
   E      denotes the encoding symbol length in bytes.
   NO     denotes the number of source objects to be considered.

   This document uses the following abbreviations:
   ADU    stands for Application Data Unit.
   TOI    stands for Transmission Object Identifier.
   SBN    stands for Source Block Number, i.e., a block identifier.
   ESI    stands for Encoding Symbol ID.

   FEC OTI  stands for FEC Object Transmission Information.


3.  Formats and Codes with FEC Encoding ID XXX for LDPC-Staircase Codes

   This section introduces the formats and codes associated with the
   Fully-Specified FEC Scheme with FEC Encoding ID XXX, which focuses on
   LDPC-Staircase Codes.  This GOE FEC Scheme is the GOE equivalent to
   FEC Encoding ID 3 defined in [RFC5170], with the further restriction
   that the number of encoding symbols per group (i.e., the number of
   symbols sent in the same packet) MUST be equal to 1 (G=1).

3.1.  FEC Payload ID (for Repair Packets Only)

   The FEC Payload ID, to be used only with repair packets, i.e.,
   packets containing a repair symbol each, is composed of the Source
   Block Number (SBN) and the Encoding Symbol ID (ESI).  There is no
   change in terms of format with respect to [RFC5170] but a restriction
   in terms of valid ESI as explained below:

   o  The Source Block Number (12-bit field) identifies from which
      source block of the object the encoding symbol in the payload is
      generated.  There is a maximum of 2^^12 blocks per object.
   o  The Encoding Symbol ID (20-bit field) identifies which specific
      encoding symbol generated from the source block is carried in the
      packet payload.  There is a maximum of 2^^20 encoding symbols per
      block.  The first k values (0 to k - 1) identify source symbols;
      the remaining n-k values (k to n-k-1) identify repair symbols.
      Since only repair symbols are considered by this GOE FEC scheme,
      only the k to n-k-1 values, inclusive, MUST be used.

   There MUST be exactly one FEC Payload ID per repair packet (since
   G=1).  This FEC Payload ID refers to the one and only symbol of the
   packet.

3.2.  FEC Object Transmission Information

3.2.1.  Mandatory Elements

   o  FEC Encoding ID: the Fully-Specified FEC Scheme described in this
      section uses FEC Encoding ID XXX.

3.2.2.  Common Elements

   The Common elements are the same as those specified in [RFC5170] for
   FEC Encoding ID 3, namely: the Transfer-Length (L), the Encoding-
   Symbol-Length (E), the Maximum-Source-Block-Length (B), and the Max-
   Number-of-Encoding-Symbols (max_n).  These common elements refer to
   the Generalized Object for which LDPC-Staircase encoding is needed.

3.2.3.  Scheme-Specific Elements

   The following element MUST be defined with the present FEC scheme.
   It defines the composition of a generalized object:

   o  N1m3: an integer between 0 (default) and 7, inclusive.  The target
      number of "1s" per column in the left side of the parity check
      matrix, N1, is then equal to N1m3 + 3.  See [RFC5170] for
      guidelines on how to set N1m3.
   o  G: in this specification, G MUST be equal to 1.
   o  the Initial Source Symbol TOI (ISS_TOI) identifies the TOI of the
      first source symbol of this generalized object.  The exact format
      of this field depends on the TOI format, which is CDP and use-case
      specific.  For instance the TOI field of an ALC session is stored
      in a field of length 32*O+16*H bits, where O and H are the TOI
      flag and Half-word flag defined in LCT's header;
   o  the ISS TOI size (ISS_O) two bit field determines the TOI size,
      which is equal to 32*ISS_O + 30 bits.  This flexibility is meant
      to be compatible with any NORM or ALC TOI format;

   o  the ISS Source Block Number (ISS_SBN) identifies the SBN of the
      first source symbol of this generalized object, within its
      original object.  This is a 16 bit field, since this value results
      from the No-Code FEC encoding of the original object;
   o  the ISS Encoding Symbol ID (ISS_ESI) identifies the ESI of the
      first source symbol of this generalized object, within its
      original block.  This is a 16 bit field, since this value results
      from the No-Code FEC encoding of the original object;
   o  the Generalized Object Size (GOS) identifies the size, in terms of
      number of source symbols that compose this generalized object;

3.2.4.  Encoding Format

   This section shows the two possible encoding formats of the above FEC
   OTI.  The present document does not specify when one encoding format
   or the other should be used.

3.2.4.1.  Using the General EXT_FTI Format

   The FEC OTI binary format is the following, when the EXT_FTI
   mechanism is used (e.g., within the ALC [RFC5775] or NORM [RFC5740]
   protocols).

3.2.4.2.  Using the FDT Instance (FLUTE specific)

   When it is desired that the FEC OTI be carried in the FDT Instance of
   a FLUTE session [FLUTE], the following XML attributes must be
   described for the associated object:
   o  FEC-OTI-FEC-Encoding-ID
   o  FEC-OTI-Transfer-Length (L)
   o  FEC-OTI-Encoding-Symbol-Length (E)
   o  FEC-OTI-Maximum-Source-Block-Length (B)
   o  FEC-OTI-Max-Number-of-Encoding-Symbols (max_n)
   o  FEC-OTI-Scheme-Specific-Info
   The FEC-OTI-Scheme-Specific-Info contains the string resulting from
   the Base64 encoding (in the XML Schema xs:base64Binary sense) of the

    Figure 3: FEC OTI Scheme Specific Information To Be Included in the
                               FDT Instance

   During Base64 encoding, the FEC OTI Scheme-Specific Information (of
   variable length) is transformed into a string of printable characters
   (in the 64-character alphabet) that is added to the FEC-OTI-Scheme-
   Specific-Info attribute.


4.  Procedures with FEC Encoding ID XXX for LDPC-Staircase Codes

   This section defines procedures that MUST be applied to FEC Encoding
   ID XXX.  The block partitioning algorithm that is defined in Section
   9.1 of [RFC5052] MUST be used.  The procedure called "Determining the
   Maximum Source Block Length (B)" in [RFC5170] MUST be used.  The
   procedure called "Determining the Maximum Number of Encoding Symbols
   Generated for Any Source Block (max_n)" in [RFC5170] MUST be used.

   The procedure called "Determining the Number of Encoding Symbols of a
   Block" in [RFC5170] MUST be used.  The procedure called "Identifying
   the G Symbols of an Encoding Symbol Group" in [RFC5170] MUST NOT be
   used, since this specification requires that the number of encoding
   symbols per group MUST be equal to 1 (G=1).  The procedure called
   "Pseudo-Random Number Generator" in [RFC5170] MUST be used.

4.1.  Determining the Encoding Symbol Length (E)

   The E parameter usually depends on the maximum transmission unit on
   the path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) from the source to each
   receiver.  This PMTU may be known, may be discovered, or may be
   estimated, depending on the target use case.  In order to minimize
   the protocol header overhead (e.g., the Layered Coding Transport
   (LCT), UDP, IPv4, or IPv6 headers in the case of ALC), E MAY be
   chosen to be as large as possible.  In that case, E is chosen so that
   the size of a packet composed of a single encoding symbol remains
   below but close to the PMTU (or by the minimum PMTU to each possible
   destinations in case of one-to-many sessions).  This value E is also
   the source symbol size (i.e., the source symbols, before FEC
   encoding, and the encoding symbols, after FEC encoding, are of equal
   size).

   This size MUST be used to segment all of the NO source objects
   considered by the GOE FEC schemes for this CDP into source symbols.
   By doing so, a Generalized Object that straddles several objects
   (among the NO possibles) benefits from the same source symbol size
   across source object boundaries.


5.  Security Considerations

   TBD


6.  Operational Considerations

   LDPC-Staircase codes have excellent erasure recovery capabilities
   with large source blocks, close to ideal MDS codes.  For instance,
   with a medium source block size k=1024, CR=2/3, N1=5, G=1, with a
   hybrid ITerative/Maximum Likelihood (IT/ML) decoding approach (see
   below) and when all symbols are sent in a random order (see below),
   the average overhead amounts to 0.64% (corresponding to 6.5 symbols
   in addition to k) and receiving 1043 symbols (corresponding to a 1.9%
   overhead) is sufficient to reduce the decoding failure probability to
   5.1*10^^-5.

   LDPC-Staircase codes are also a good solution whenever processing



Roca, et al.             Expires April 26, 2012                [Page 11]

   requirements at a software encoder or decoder must be kept to a
   minimum.  This is true when the decoder uses an IT decoding
   algorithm, or an ML algorithm (we use a Gaussian Elimination as the
   ML algorithm) when this latter is carefully implemented and the
   source block size kept reasonable, or a mixture of both techniques
   which is the recommended solution.  For instance an average decoding
   speed between 1.3 Gbps (corresponding to a very bad channel, close to
   the theoretical decoding limit and requiring an ML decoding) and 4.3
   Gbps (corresponding to a medium quality channel where IT decoding is
   sufficient) are easily achieved with a source block size composed of
   k=1024 source symbols, a code rate CR=2/3 (i.e., 512 repair symbols),
   1024 byte long symbols, G=1, and N1=5, on an Intel Xeon 5120/1.86GHz
   workstation running Linux/64 bits.  Additionally, with a hybrid IT/ML
   approach, a receiver can decide if and when ML decoding is used,
   depending on local criteria (e.g., battery or CPU capabilities),
   independently from other receivers.

   As the source block size decreases, the erasure recovery capabilities
   of LDPC codes in general also decrease.  In the case of LDPC-
   Staircase codes, in order to compensate this phenomenon, it is
   recommended to increase the N1 parameter and to use a hybrid IT/ML
   decoding approach.  For instance, with a small source block size
   k=256 symbols, CR=2/3, N1=7, and G=1, the average overhead amounts to
   0.67% (corresponding to 1.7 symbols in addition to k), and receiving
   267 symbols (corresponding to a 4.3% overhead) is sufficient to
   reduce the decoding failure probability to 1.4*10^^-5.  Using N1=9
   further improves these results if need be, which also enables to use
   LDPC-Staircase codes with k=100 symbols for instance.

   With very small source blocks (e.g., a few tens symbols), using for
   instance Reed-Solomon codes [RFC5510] or 2D parity check codes MAY be
   more appropriate.

   The way the FEC Repair Packets are transmitted is of high importance.
   A good strategy, that works well for any kind of channel loss model,
   consists in sending FEC Repair Packets in random order (rather than
   in sequence) while FEC Source Packets are sent first and in sequence.
   Sending all packets in a random order is another possibility, but it
   requires that all repair symbols for a source block be produced
   first, which adds some extra delay at a sender.

   For further information, the interested reader can refer for instance
   to [Cunche08][CunchePHD10].


7.  IANA Considerations

   Values of FEC Encoding IDs and FEC Instance IDs are subject to IANA

   registration.  For general guidelines on IANA considerations as they
   apply to this document, see [RFC5052].

   This document assigns the Fully-Specified FEC Encoding ID XXX under
   the "ietf:rmt:fec:encoding" name-space to "Generalized Object
   Encoding for LDPC-Staircase codes".
