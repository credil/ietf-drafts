Abstract

   This memo specifies 6rd's multicast component so that IPv6 hosts can
   receive multicast data from IPv6 servers.  In AMT based encapsulation
   solution, AMT Gateway at the 6rd Customer Edge router uses AMT
   protocol to establish a tunnel interface with AMT Relay at the 6rd
   Border Relay and this tunnel is used to exchange MLD messages to
   establish multicast state at AMT Relay so that AMT Relay can tunnel
   IPv6 multicast data to IPv6 hosts connected to AMT Gateway.  In 6rd
   Translation Multicast based solution, the protocol is based on
   proxying MLD at the 6rd Customer Edge router and then translating MLD
   messages to IGMP messages and sending them upstream to a network
   which supports IPv4 multicast. 6rd Border Relay is multicast router
   and IGMP-MLD translator.  It translates IGMP join back to MLD join
   message and sends it to multicast source.  IPv6 Multicast data
   received at 6rd Border Relay is translated into IPv4 multicast data
   and then sent to IPv4 multicast tree downstream to 6rd Customer Edge
   which translates back to IPv6 multicast data then delivers to the
   hosts.

Internet-Draft          Multicast Support for 6rd             March 2012


1.  Introduction

   With IPv4 address depletion on the horizon, many techniques are being
   standardized for IPv6 migration including 6rd [RFC5969]. 6rd enables
   IPv6 hosts to communicate with external hosts using IPv4 only legacy
   ISP network. 6rd Customer Edge (CE) device's LAN side is dual stack
   and WAN side is IPv4 only.  CE tunnels IPv6 packets received from the
   LAN side to 6rd Border Relays (BR) after encapsulating IPv6 packet in
   an IPv4 packet.  BRs have anycast IPv4 addresses and receive
   encapsulated packets from CEs over a virtual interface. 6rd operation
   is stateless.  Packets are received/ sent independent of each other
   and no state needs to be maintained.

   It should be noted that there is no depletion problem for IPv4
   address space allocated for any source multicast and source specific
   multicast [RFC3171].  This document is not motivated by the depletion
   of IPv4 multicast addresses.

   6rd as defined in [RFC5969] and [RFC5569] is unicast only.  It does
   not support multicast.  In this document we specify how multicast
   from home IPv6 users can be supported in 6rd.  This is what is meant
   by 6rd multicast protocol.

   Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT) enables the host(s) in an AMT
   site to connect to an AMT Relay which is a multicast router in the
   multicast infrastructure [I-D.ietf-mboned-auto-multicast].  The
   network between an AMT site and Relay is not multicast enabled and is
   seen as non-broadcast multi-access (NBMA) link layer [RFC2491].

   When an AMT gateway receives an MLD join message to an Any-Source
   Multicast (ASM) or Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) group, it first
   discovers an AMT Relay using Anycast Relay IP address.  Using a three
   way handshake, the gateway sends MLD membership report message in a
   UDP tunnel to the relay.  Relay joins the source in the multicast
   infrastructure and sends multicast data downstream to all member
   gateways in a UDP tunnel.  When a gateway has no membership state,
   i.e. after all member hosts leave the group(s), its state with the
   relay expires and the gateway can start relay discovery all over
   again.  Periodically the relay and gateway exchage AMT Query and AMT
   Membership Update messages.  All AMT control messages are secured
   using message authentication codes (MAC)
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-auto-multicast].

   AMT works for both IPv4 using IGMP and IPv6 using MLD.  IGMP messages
   are encapsulated in IPv4 using UDP encapsulation and MLD messages are
   encapsulated in IPv6 using UDP encapsulation.

   In this document we address 6rd multicast problem and propose two

   architectures: Automatic Multicast tunneling (AMT) and translation
   based solutions.  Layer 2 multicast support for the translatiom
   solution is also described.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC5969], [RFC5569],
   [RFC3810], [RFC3376] and [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast].


3.  Requirements

   This section states requirements on 6rd multicast support protocol.

   IPv6 hosts connected to 6rd CE router MUST be able to join multicast
   groups in IPv6 and receive multicast data.

   Both any source multicast (ASM) and source specific multicast (SSM)
   MUST be supported.

   6rd multicast MUST NOT introduce the need to use IPv4 addresses
   thereby contributing to the public IPv4 address depletion.

   6rd CE MAY support AMT gateway as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-auto-multicast].  Modifications to AMT protocol
   defined in this document applies.

   6rd BR MAY support AMT relay as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-auto-multicast].  Modifications to AMT protocol
   defined in this document applies.

   In case of translation solution, 6rd CE MUST support MLD Proxy as
   defined in [RFC4605]. 6rd CE MAY support IGMP Proxy.

   In case of proxy solution, 6rd BR MUST support MLD Querier. 6rd CE
   MAY support IGMP Querier.


4.  Architecture

   In 6rd, there are hosts (possibly IPv4/ IPv6 dual stack) served by
   6rd Customer Edge device.  CE is dual stack facing the hosts and IPv4
   only facing the network or WAN side.  At the boundary of the network
   there is 6rd Border Relay.  BR receives IPv6 packets tunneled in IPv4
   from CE and decapsulates them and sends them out to IPv6 network.

   Unicast 6rd is stateless.  Each IPv6 packet sent by CE treated

Internet-Draft          Multicast Support for 6rd             March 2012


   separately and different packets from the same CE may go to different
   BRs.  CE encapsulates IPv6 packet in IPv4 with destination address
   set to BR address (usually anycast IPv4 address).  BRs are placed
   where IPv6 native connectivity exists.  BR receives the encapsulated
   packet and decapsulates and send it to IPv6 network.  CEs are
   configured with 6rd Prefixes from ISPs prefix and with a number of BR
   IPv4 addresses.  Each host is given a prefix which contains 6rd
   Prefix and the host's IPv4 prefix.  BR receives IPv6 packets
   addressed to this ISP and from the destination address it extracts
   the destination host's IPv4 address and uses this address as
   destination address and encapsulates the IPv6 packet in IPv4 and
   sends it to IPv4-only network.

   6rd considers IPv4-only network as an NBMA link from IPv6 point of
   view and all 6rd CEs and BRs are defined as off-link neighbors from
   one other.

4.1.  AMT Architecture

   6rd network lends itself easily to the Automatic Multicast Tunneling
   (AMT) architecture.  Dual stack hosts connected to the Customer Edge
   router is an AMT site and it is multicast enabled.  IPv4 only network
   is the unicast only network.  At the boundary of the network 6rd
   Border Relay is connected to the native multicast backbone
   infrastructure.

   We place AMT Gateway at the CE router instead of at the hosts.  CE
   router serves all the connected hosts.  For multicast traffic, CE
   Router has an AMT pseudo-interface that serves as a default multicast
   route.  It is a tunneling interface.

   AMT Relay is placed at 6rd BR.  AMT Relay also has a pseudo-
   interface.  A given relay and all CEs (AMT Gateways) connected to it
   can be considered to be on a separate logical NBMA link.  On this
   link, gateways and relay communicate using AMT protocol to transmit
   and receive multicast control messages for membership management and
   multicast data from the relay to the gateways.

   All the elements of 6rd multicast support system with AMT are shown
   in Figure 1.

   AMT protocol is designed to provide IPv6 multicast to the hosts in
   AMT site using AMT messages in IPv6.  AMT protocol is designed to
   provide IPv4 multicast to the hosts in AMT site using AMT messages in
   IPv4.  However, in 6rd the network is IPv4 only.  We need to modify
   it to use IPv4 AMT protocol to transmit IPv6 multicast messages such
   as MLD messages and IPv6 multicast data.

4.2.  Translation Architecture

   In order to support multicast, CE implements MLD Proxy [RFC4605] and
   MLD to IGMP translation function.  IPv6 hosts send their join
   requests (MLD Membership Report messages) to CE.  CE as a proxy sends
   aggregated IGMP Report messages upstream towards BR.

   In order to support SSM, MLDv2 and IGMPv3 MUST be supported by the
   host, CE and BR.

   BR is the default multicast querier for CE.  BR implements IGMP to
   MLD translation function and multicast router function or it could be
   another MLD proxy.

   It is assumed that IPv4 only network to which CE and BR are connected
   supports native IPv4 multicast.

   All the elements of 6rd translation-based multicast support system
   are shown in Figure 2.

            Figure 2: Architecture of 6rd Translation Multicast


5.  6rd AMT Multicast Operation

   When a host (H1, H2 or H3 in Figure 1) wants to join an IPv6
   multicast group, it sends an MLD report (MLDv2 report for a source-
   specific group) to CE router.  CE router uses one of 6rdBRIPv4Address
   values (anycast address of BR) this CE router is configured with.

   CE sends AMT Relay Discovery IPv4 message which is a UDP message sent
   to a IANA reserved AMT port, e.g. 2268.  In the payload of this
   message CE MUST set the M bit to indicate that CE will encapsulate
   MLD messages in IPv4.  Note that all UMT messages are UDP messages.

   BR (topologically closest to this CE router) receives the message and
   replies with AMT Relay Advertisement UDP message in IPv4.  BR checks
   to see if it can provide IPv6 multicast service and if yes it replies
   with AMT Relay Advertisement message.  BR MUST set the M bit to
   indicate that it can provide IPv6 multicast service.

   CE receives AMT Relay Advertisement message.  CE now has BR's unicast
   address which it uses to send all multicast packets for this session.
   CE sends AMT Request message to BR's unicast address to begin the
   process of joining IPv6 multicast group.  CE initializes a timer used
   to send periodic requests.

   BR sends AMT Query message.  In this message an MLD Listener Query
   message is encapsulated [I-D.ietf-mboned-auto-multicast] with an IP
   header.

   CE receives AMT Query message and responds by sending AMT Membership
   Update message.  This message encapsulates MLD Membership Report
   message with an IP header to request BR to join IPv6 multicast group
   the host wants to join.

   BR receives AMT Membership Update message and it adds the tunnel to
   the CE in its outgoing interface list for the group that the host
   wants to join.  BR will send a join message towards the source of the
   multicast group to build a multicast tree in the native multicast
   infrastructure.

   After the initial three way handshake, periodically AMT Membership
   Query and AMT Membership Update messages are exchanged between BR and
   CE.  As for multicast data, the data packets from the source received
   at BR will be replicated to all interfaces in it's outgoing interface
   list as well as the tunnel outgoing interface for all member CEs.  BR
   sends multicast data in AMT Multicast Data messages to CE with the

Internet-Draft          Multicast Support for 6rd             March 2012


   data packet encapsulated in UDP packet with IP header.

   CE receives AMT Multicast Data message over the pseudo interface
   associated with the tunnel to BR.  CE forwards the packet to the
   outgoing interfaces joined by the hosts.

   Another host wants to join another IPv6 multicast group, three-way
   handshake involving AMT Request/ AMT Membership Query and AMT
   Membership Update is needed but AMT Relay Discovery/ AMT Relay
   Advertisement messages are not needed.

5.1.  Modifications to AMT Messages

   This specification uses AMT messages as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-auto-multicast] except the changes stated in this
   section.

   AMT Relay Discovery message changes include the addition of two
   flags, M and I flags.  AMT gateway uses these flags to negotiate MLD
   (IGMP) message transmission in IPv4 (IPv6).

   A summary of the AMT Relay Discovery message format is shown below.

   Relay Address

      The unicast IPv4 address of the AMT relay.

5.2.  Supporting IPv4 Multicast in 6rd AMT Multicast

   IPv4 multicast can be supported in a way similar to IPv6 using AMT
   architecture as described in Section 5. 6rd Customer Edge device has
   AMT Gateway function as described in [I-D.ietf-mboned-auto-multicast]
   with no extensions.  IPv4 hosts connected to AMT Gateway send and
   receive IGMP messages [RFC3376] to AMT Gateway which uses AMT
   protocol to subscribe the multicast groups with AMT Relay at 6rd
   Border Relay.  AMT Relay sends IPv4 multicast data in UDP
   encapsulated IPv4 messages to AMT Gateway.

5.3.  Avalanche Problem

   As in Section 5, multicast data is replicated to all interfaces, i.e.
   to all member CEs at the BR.  This replication (often called
   avalanche problem) can be very costly if there are very large number
   of downstream member CEs such as in IPTV application, see Appendix A
   in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast].

   In 6rd multicast, avalanche problem can be avoided by careful network
   partitioning.  More BRs can be deployed in areas where IPv6 users are
   increasing in numbers.  Deploying BRs colocating it at the access
   network gateway such as at the Border Network Gateway (BNG) is
   another possibility.


6.  6rd Translation Multicast Operation

   In this section we specify how the host can subscribe and receive
   IPv6 multicast data from IPv6 content providers based on the
   architecture defined in Figure 2.

   The hosts will send their subscription requests for IPv6 multicast
   groups upstream to the default router, i.e.  Costumer Edge device.
   After subscribing the group, the host can receive multicast data from
   the CE.  The host implements MLD protocol's host part.

   Customer Edge device is MLD Proxy.  After receiving the first MLD
   Report message requesting subscription to an IPv6 multicast group, CE
   translates MLD Membership Report message into IGMP Membership report
   message and sends it upstream only if joining a new group is needed.

   Address translation in generating IGMP Membership report message is
   done as follows: Destination address is copied from the last 32 bits

   of IPv6 multicast group address.  CE inserts IPv4 address of its WAN
   interface into the source address.  It is assumed that IPv6 multicast
   group address in MLD Report message conforms to the addressing scheme
   described in [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format], i.e. for
   any-source and source-specific multicast address format.

   Source addresses in MLDv2 payload are translated as follows:
   Multicast source addresses in MLD Membership Report message MUST use
   uPrefix64, i.e. 64:ff9b::/96 defined in [RFC6052]. uPrefix64
   facilitates translation into IPv4 source address to be used in IGMPv3
   Membership Report message for source-specific multicast, i.e. by
   extracting the last 32 bits of IPv6 source address.

   IGMP Report message is received by IGMP Querier/Proxy upstream on the
   link (normally this node is Broadband Network Gateway, BNG in
   broadband networks).  IGMP Querier/Proxy sends IGMPv3 Report message
   to the neighboring routers to join the group.  In networks where PIM
   is supported, IGMP Report message may be received by PIM Designated
   Router.  PIM router sends PIMv4 join message to join IPv4 group.

   The border router that receives the join message translates the
   message into MLD.  IPv6 Multicast group address is obtained from the
   destination address to join IPv6 group for any-source multicast.  For
   source-specific multicast, IPv6 source address is generated after
   obtaining IPv4 source address of Membership Report message's Group
   Record Source Address field.  BR sends PIMv6 join message upstream
   towards the source.

   BR MUST act as the designated router to which the source of the
   source-specific IGMP join message is connected.  BR MUST act as the
   rendez-vous point (RP) of the multicast group for the any-source
   multicast IGMP join message.  Normally there is one such BR in an
   operator's network.  An IPv4 multicast tree eventually forms in the
   network between CE and BR and IPv6 multicast tree upstream from BR
   for the same ASM or SSM group.

   IPv6 multicast data received from the source at the border router is
   translated into IPv4.  The last 32 bits of the source and destination
   address fields determine the source and destination addresses of IPv4
   multicast data packet.  This packet is sent downstream on the
   multicast tree already formed for this IPv4 multicast group.

   Multicast data packet address translation follows the rules in
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format] for the multicast group
   address and [RFC6052] for source-specific multicast source address,
   i.e. using uPrefix64.  For any-source multicast, Border Router
   inserts an IPv4 source address, different for each source.

   Packet header translation follows the rules in [RFC6145].
   Fragmentation and reassembly are handled as described in [RFC6145].
   After IPv4 multicast data packet is sent downstream from BR it may be
   fragmented by the routers.

   CE receives IPv4 multicast data packet, possibly in fragments and
   reassembles the fragments.  CE translates IPv4 multicast data packet
   back to IPv6 multicast data packet.  Address translation is done
   following [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format] for multicast
   group addresses and [RFC6052] for unicast SSM source addresses.
   Header translation is done as in [RFC6145].

   IPv6 multicast data is sent on the home link to the host(s).  IEEE
   802.3 or IEEE 802.11 multicast link support usually handles this
   delivery in Layer 2 without any packet duplication if there are more
   than one members to the any-source multicast group or SSM source and
   multicast group.

6.1.  Solution Based on Layer 2 Multicast Support

   In this section we assume that Layer 2 multicast is supported in the
   network.  Layer 2 multicast support is done in order to forward
   multicast data downstream to the ports of Layer 2 devices, i.e.
   switches that requested a multicast group instead of flooding the
   data to all the ports.

   In the switches called snooping switches, multicast MAC address based
   filters are setup which link Layer 2 multicast groups to the egress
   ports.  IGMP snooping switches are commonly used in operators
   networks, most commonly at the access nodes (AN)
   [I-D.ietf-6man-lineid].

   When an IGMP Report message is received, the bridge will setup a
   multicast filter entry that allows (in case of a join message) or
   prevents (in case of a leave message) packets to flow the port on
   which the IGMP Report message was received.  In terms of IPv4
   multicast addresses, the mapping is not unique as 32 IPv4 multicast
   addresses map to a single Ethernet multicast MAC address [RFC4541].

   The main functionality of a snooping switch is to forward multicast
   data packets based on the filters that are setup, i.e. to those
   egress ports with multicast groups downstream and also to the router
   ports.

   In a 6rd network the snooping switches MUST detect IGMP packets sent
   upstream by CE and set the filtering rules accordingly.  When IPv4
   data packets are received the IGMP snooping switches forward these
   packets towards all CEs that have members, effectively achieving

   packet duplication at the access node level.

6.2.  Analysis

   An analysis of the translation solution reveals the following:

   Translation solution imposes a requirement on the IPv6 source-
   specific multicast sources to use uPrefix64 compatible source
   addresses.  This requirement can not be satified with simple
   configuration of the CPE router and Border Router.

   In the case of any-source multicast, the border router must use a
   public IPv4 address distinctively to represent each IPv6 any-source
   multicast source.

   In deployments which use IGMP routers not PIM routers, source-
   specific multicast can be supported only if all routers have been
   upgraded to IGMPv3 and no IGMPv1 or IGMPv2 systems are present.
   Otherwise the operation reverts to the older version of IGMP to
   preserve compatibility and thus SSM can not be supported.  With the
   use of PIM routers, this is avoided.

   Border router must act as the designated router or the rendez-vous
   point for IPv4/IPv6 multicast group and this may lead to the use of a
   single border router in the network instead of load sharing with
   various border routers.


7.  Security Considerations

   All AMT control messages are secured using Message Authentication
   Code (MAC) that is a cryptographic hash of a private secret, the
   originators address, and the request nonce.  AMT data messages are
   not secured. 6rd Proxy Multicast control and data message security
   are as described in [RFC5969].  The threats and their mitigation
   described in [RFC5969] apply to multicast communication as well.


8.  IANA Considerations

   AMT Relay Discovery and AMT Relay Advertisement messages are modified
   as in Section 5.1.
