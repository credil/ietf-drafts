        <t>The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>
        provides guidance on the definition and specification of performance

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>Real-time applications employ a jitter buffer to absorb jitter
        introduced on the path from source to destination. These metrics are
        used to report how the jitter buffer at the receiving end of RTP
        stream behaves as a result of jitter in the network and are applicable
        to a range of RTP applications.</t>

        <t>These metrics reflect how terminal-related factors affect real-time
        application quality and are useful to provide better end-user quality
        of experience (QoE).</t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

    <section title="Jitter Buffer Operation">
      <t>A jitter buffer is required to absorb delay variation in network
      delivery of media packets. A jitter buffer works by holding media data
      for a period of time after it is received but before it s played out.
      Packets that arrive relatively early are held in the jitter buffer
      relatively longer. Playout can fail if packets arrive too early and find
      no available jitter buffer space to be held until time for playout.
      Playout can also fail if packets are delayed excessively by the network
      and arrive too late after they are scheduled to be played.</t>

      <t>The jitter buffer can be considered as a time window with one side
      (the early side) aligned with the delay corresponding to the early
      arriving packet and the other side (the late side) representing the
      maximum permissible delay before a late arriving packet would be
      discarded. The Jitter Buffer delay is referred to as the time spent in
      the jitter buffer. The Jitter Buffer Nominal delay is the delay that is
      applied to a packet that arrives at its expected time (i.e. 0 jitter) -
      and corresponds to the late window of the jitter buffer. The Jitter
      buffer maximum delay is the delay that is applied to an earliest
      arriving packet that is not discarded and corresponds to the early
      window of the jitter buffer. </t>

      <t>Note that when a packet arrives at its expected time (i.e. 0 jitter),
      this packet will fall between left window and right window and we also
      call this packet as the packet that arrives exactly on time. The jitter
      buffer nominal delay uses this packet as the reference packet. The
      reference point would typically be selected as the first packet. However
      the reference point could also be selected based on some other common
      criterions, e.g., a running average of the delay. </t>

      <section title="Fixed Jitter Buffer">
        <t>A receiver can use either a fixed or adaptive jitter buffer method.
        A fixed jitter buffer method is a simple implementation with the fixed
        jitter buffer size but may not do a good job of accommodating varying
        network performance. The fixed jitter buffer may also have extra
        buffer memory and therefore incur extra media latency compared to an
        adaptive implementation.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Adaptive Jitter Buffer">
        <t>An adaptive jitter buffer method has adaptive jitter buffer size
        and may adjust jitter buffer delay during playback in response to
        changing network performance. The jitter buffer delay is typically
        adjusted to minimize media latency while also minimizing of lost data
        due to packets arriving too early or too late. </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Jitter Buffer Metrics Block">
      <t>This block describes the configuration and operating parameters of
      the jitter buffer in the receiver of the RTP end system or RTP mixer
      which sends the report. Instances of this Metrics Block refer by SSRC to
      the separate auxiliary Measurement Information block <xref
      target="RFC6776"></xref> which describes the measurement interval in
      use. This Metrics Block relies on the measurement interval in the
      Measurement Information block indicating the span of the report and
      should be sent in the same compound RTCP packet as the measurement
      information block. If the measurement interval is not received in the
      same compound RTCP packet as this Metrics Block, this Metrics Block
      should be discarded.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for
            the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR
            packets can be signaled by an application if it employs the
            Session Description Protocol (SDP). XR packets are composed of
            report blocks, and seven block types are defined here. The purpose
            of the extended reporting format is to convey information that
            supplements the six statistics that are contained in the report
            blocks used by RTCP's Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR)
            packets. Some applications, such as multicast inference of network
            characteristics (MINC) or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring, require
            other and more detailed statistics. In addition to the block types
            defined here, additional block types may be defined in the future
            by adhering to the framework that this document provides.</t>
