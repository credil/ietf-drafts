    Protocol to Access White Space database: security considerations
                     draft-wu-paws-secutity-00.txt

Abstract

   PAWS is an access protocol between the Master device and the White
   Space(WS) Database.  Master Devices connect to the white space
   database directly using WS interface,but only authorized devices can
   get the service from database.If an attacker can have full access to
   the network medium between the master device and the database, the
   attacker may deploy varieties of attacks on the network if there is
   lack of security mechanism.

   The present document describes the security threats to the current
   framework of PAWS, and meanwhile proposes the corresponding
   countermeasures.

Internet-Draft        PAWS security considerations             July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Portions of the radio spectrums that are allocated to a licensed,
   primary user but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and
   times are defined as "white space".  The concept of allowing
   secondary transmissions (licensed or unlicensed) in white space is a
   technique to "unlock" existing spectrum.  Currently, the widely
   accepted scheme of utilizing white space is by querying the database
   and the related protocol "Protocol to Access White Space database
   (PAWS)" is proposed.

   Entities of master device and Database, the interface between the two
   entities would have been defined in PAWS.  There are much sensitive
   information, such as location and identity of master devices, which
   MAY be transmitted between the interface of the master device and the
   white space database when the PAWS is used.  Attackers are able to
   make various types of attack by using the sensitive information if
   there is lack of security mechanism.  Therefore, the messaging
   interface between the master device and the database needs to be
   secured.  Meanwhile, the two entities SHALL be mutually authenticated
   and they both MUST be authorized by authority of white space
   management institution.

   In this document, the security threats, the security features and the
   security mechanism(TLS) are discussed in details.

3.  Overview of Security threats and Requirements

3.1.  Fundamental system architecture of PAWS

   Figure 1 shows a common system model of PAWS, the master device is
   connected to internet by any means other than using the white space
   radio.  More details of PAWS are described using the following steps:

                     \|/                              ----------
                      |                     .---.     |Database|
                      |                    (     )    /---------
                    |-|---------|         /       \  /
                    |  Master   |        ( Internet )
                    |  device   |========( insecure )
                    |-----------|         \  link) /
                                           (      )
                                            (----)


                   Figure 1: system architecture of PAWS

   Description of system architecture:

   1) The master device needs to discover white space database in the
   relevant regulatory domain by connecting to the internet by any means
   other than using the white space radio.

   2) The master device will connect to the white space database, the
   link between master device and the white space database can be wired
   or wireless and provide IP connectivity, which may be insecure.

   3) The master device may register with the white space database
   before the white space database provides information on available
   white space radio channels according to regulatory domain
   requirements.  The information used in registration may include, but
   is not limited to, the device ID, the device's location, serial
   number assigned by the manufacturer and so on.

   4) The master device queries the white space database for available
   white space channel lists.

3.2.  Security threats

   If there is lack of security mechanism in above PAWS architecture,
   various threats detailed in "ietf-paws-problem-stmt-use-cases-rqmts"
   may exist, and the corresponding attacks can be deployed.  It can be
   summarized as follows from a security point of view:

Internet-Draft        PAWS security considerations             July 2012


3.2.1.  Impersonation of a master device

   If there is no authentication of the master device, the white space
   database cannot detect the rogue master device, and the available
   white space channel list will be passed to the Rogue master device.
   This enables a rogue master device to use the available channels.
   Besides, the rogue master device can connect to the white space
   database by using the registration exchanges, the DoS type attacks
   may be initiated.  This shows that it is essential to perform some
   type of authentication of master device.

3.2.2.  Impersonation of database

   If there is no authentication of the database, an attacker may
   attempt to spoof a white space database and provide responses to a
   master device which are malicious and result in the master device
   causing interference to the primary user of the spectrum.  At the
   same time, the attacker also can retrieve an available white space
   channel list from a legal database using the registration exchanges,
   which received from the master device.

3.2.3.  MitM on the interface between master device and database

   A man in the middle (MitM) node is inserted in between the master
   device and database, it can be considered to be a variant of the
   above attacks.  The real master device will connect to the MitM node
   and the MitM node can connect to the real database.  The MitM node
   can transparently transmit, receive, view, and modify the traffic
   between the real master device and the database without either of
   those nodes being aware of it.  The important security point
   illustrated by this attack is that not only is it essential to
   perform mutual authentication of the master device and the white
   space database, it is important to ensure that all security tunnels
   from the master device terminate in the trusted white space database
   instead of in a MitM node.

3.2.4.  Attacks on the link of interface between master device and
        database

   The link between the master device and the white space database can
   be wired or wireless.  An attacker may listen to the communication
   between a valid master device and database.  The threats of this are
   as follows:

   1) Steal the confidentiality of data transmitted in the packet
   payload, such as utilize the information about available channels by
   utilizing those channels.  The result of such an attack is
   unauthorized use of channels by an unauthorized device.

Internet-Draft        PAWS security considerations             July 2012


   2) The location/identity information can be gleaned by an
   eavesdropper and be used for tracking purposes.

   3) An attacker could modify the communication between the master
   device and the database.  The channel information and some other type
   parameters could be modified by an attacker which may result in
   interference to the primary user of that channel.  Alternatively the
   attacker may indicate no channel availability at a location resulting
   in a denial of service to the master device.

3.2.5.  Attacks on the master device itself

   The master device may be deployed in vulnerable locations, and the
   less trusted types of transmission links will be used to interconnect
   that equipment to the database.  Breaking the master device to get
   sensitive data is theoretically possible.  The attacker may dig out
   the master device-database shared secret or a long term certificate
   from the master device and tries to add another master device.

3.2.6.  Other potential attacks(To be added)

3.3.  Security countermeasures

   To mitigate the above threats, the security countermeasures below
   should be used.  Namely:

   1) The master device shall be authenticated by database based on a
   globally unique and permanent master device identity when it wants to
   establish connection with the database.

   2) The master device shall authenticate the identity of database.

   3) The master device and the white space database shall check that
   both of them are authorized by the regulator body of white space.

   4) Sensitive data including authentication credentials, user
   information, cryptographic keys shall not be transmitted between the
   master device and the white space database in plaintext in
   unauthorized access.  It means that the transport of data over the
   interface between the master device and the database shall be
   integrity, confidentially, and replay protected from unauthorized.

   5) The master device should have a secure module to store long term
   key or certificate.  The identity of master device could be stored in
   a trusted physical module and/or a possible non-removable smartcard.

4.  Security schemes

4.1.  Overview

   According to the previous analysis, the security mechanism shall be
   able to provide the following security features:

   1) Mutual authentication

   Mutual authentication between the master device and the database
   shall be performed using certificates or pre-shared keys and so on.
   Besides, the master device and the database shall further be
   authenticated by the authority of regulatory body of white space to
   ensure that they are both authorized by regulatory body of white
   space due to the fact that the database may not be deployed by
   regulatory body of white space.  The credentials and critical
   security functions for authentication shall be protected inside
   physically secure environment,such as Trusted Environment(TrE).

   2) The protection mechanisms of the data

   The data over the interface between the master device and the
   database shall be protected for integrity, confidentiality and anti-
   replay from unauthorized parties.

   3) Trusted environment

   The TrE shall be a logical entity which provides a trustworthy
   environment for the execution of sensitive functions and the storage
   of sensitive data.  All data produced through execution of functions
   within the TrE shall be unknowable to unauthorized external entities.

4.2.  Analysis of security schemes

   For business reasons or ease of management, databases may be deployed
   by different third-party that is authorized by regulatory body of
   white space.  It means that there are two possible deployment cases:
   one is that the databases deployed by the third-party which are
   authorized by regulatory body of white space; the other is that the
   databases are directly deployed by regulatory body of white space.

4.2.1.  Databases deployed by third-party

   In this scene, when the master device wants to query the database for
   an available white space list, it shall be able to connect to the
   database and also be authorized by regulatory body of white space to
   use white space.  It means that twice authentications shall be
   implemented, two suits of credentials are stored in master device and

   white space database which are provided by different trusted
   authorities.  There are two possible authentication models which are
   showed as follow:

   Model 1

         +-----------------------------------------------+
         | The credentials of master device and database |
         | which is used for the first authentication are|

               +--------+       /     +--------+            +------+

                                \                    /
                                 \                  /
                  +--------------------------------------------------+
                  | Through the secure channel,the authentication    |
                  | information will be provided to database and then|
                  | forward to RBWS for the second authentication    |
                  +--------------------------------------------------+



                     Figure 2: authentication model 1

   In this model, the credentials of the master device and the database
   for second authentication both shall be checked by authority of RBWS
   after the master device successfully access to the white space
   database whenever the master device query the database, but what the
   database needs to do is able to establish connection with authority
   of regulatory body of white space (RBWS).

   Under this circumstance, the whole querying procedure of white space
   channels can be showed as followed:

                 Figure 3: procedure of querying database

   Firstly, the mutual authentication between the master device and the
   database shall be supported based on the credentials which are
   provided by an authority trusted by the third-party, e.g. the
   authority of third-party or by another party trusted by the third-
   party.  Only the master device which has credentials with the third-
   party that deployed the database can connect to the database.  And
   the master device also shall evaluate the connected database if it is
   a trusted database where the master device is able to register and
   receive service from the database.  Namely the secure connectivity
   between the master device and the database shall be established first
   before the master device can query the available white space from the
   database.

   Secondly, following the above successful mutual authentication
   between the master device and the database, they both shall also be
   authenticated and authorized by regulatory body of white space.  The
   master device provides the information for authentication to database
   through the WS interface and then forward to regulatory body of white
   space by database.  The credentials used for secondary authentication
   shall be provided by authority trusted by regulatory body of white
   space, e.g. the authority of regulatory body of white space or by
   another party trusted by the regulatory body of white space.

   Finally, only when the twice mutual authentications are both passed,

Internet-Draft        PAWS security considerations             July 2012


   the master device can query the database for available white space
   channels.

   In addition, the information which is used for second authentication
   or for registration may be transmitted between master device and
   database after the first successful authentication, these information
   may contain sensitive data which shall not be known by others.  So
   the secure channel shall be established after the first

   In this model, the master device and database both can connect to
   regulatory body of white space.

   On this occasion, the credentials provided by trusted authority of
   third-party are used to mutual authentication between the master
   device and the database first.  The master device and the white space
   database must establish connection with RSWB respectively and
   authenticated by the authority of RBWS when the previous mutual

   authentication is successful.  Then the master device and database
   shall check whether the authorized information assigned by regulatory
   body of white space will be exchanged through the WS interface is
   legal.  Only the two authentication procedures are both successful,
   the master device is able to query the database for available white
   space channel.

4.2.2.  Databases deployed by regulatory body of white space

   In this scenario, the master device can directly query the connected
   database for available white space lists when it is able to connect
   to the trusted database due to the fact that the databases are
   deployed by regulatory body of white space and the management of
   white space is also by regulatory body of white space.  Only one
   credentials are needed, the credentials used to mutual authentication
   between master device and database can be assigned by trusted
   authority of regulatory body of white space, e.g. the authority of
   regulatory body of white space or by another party trusted by the
   regulatory body of white space.  The security model can be showed as
   followed:

   After the successful mutual authentication, the secure channel shall
   be established to protect the communication between the master device
   and the database.  The master device and the database shall not
   engage in any communication prior to the completion of the
   establishment of the secure channel other than messages for
   establishing the secure channel.

   The TLS protocol depicted in section 4.3 can be considered to
   establish the secure channel according to the above analysis.The
   alternative security scheme IPsec can also be used in PAWS.  But

   TLS is introduced in this document.

4.3.  TLS protocol

4.3.1.  Brief introduction of TLS protocol

   TLS protocol provides the communications privacy over the internet
   which is composed of two layers: the TLS Record Protocol and the TLS
   Handshake Protocol.

   1) The TLS Handshake Protocol is responsible for negotiating a
   session, which is used to allow peers to agree upon security
   parameters for the record layer, authenticate themselves, instantiate
   negotiated security parameters, and report error conditions to each
   other.

   a) The peer's identity can be authenticated using asymmetric, or
   public key, cryptography (e.g., RSA, DSA, etc).  X509 certificate is
   recommended.  When the certificate is used to authenticate the
   identity of the entity, each party shall verify the other's
   certificate whether it is valid and has not expired or revoked.

   b) According the [RFC5246], RSA or Diffie-Hellman can be used for
   authentication and key exchange.

   c) A pre_master_secret is created by key exchange process in TLS
   handshake protocol, which will be used to generate the master_secret.
   The master secret is required to generate the encryption keys and
   integrity keys.

   2) The TLS Record Protocol takes messages to be transmitted,
   fragments the data into manageable blocks, optionally compresses the
   data, applies a MAC, encrypts, and transmits the result.  Received
   data is decrypted, verified, decompressed, and reassembled, then
   delivered to higher level clients.  Two basic security properties are
   as follows:

   a) Confidentiality: symmetric cryptography is used for data
   encryption (e.g., AES, etc).  The derivation of encryption keys are
   based on a secret negotiated by the TLS handshake protocol.

   b) Integrity: A keyed MAC is used to message integrity check.  Secure
   hash functions (e.g., SHA-1, etc) are used for MAC generated.

4.3.2.  Security establishment procedure between master device and
        database

   In related reference of PAWS, TCP and HTTP are recommended to be used

   to load the messages in the interface between the master device and
   the database.

   When the TLS protocol is used, all HTTP data between master device
   and the white space database must be sent as TLS "application data".
   Normal HTTP behavior should be followed.  It means that security
   association shall be set up by using TLS protocol before
   establishment of the HTTP connection, and the mutual authentication
   shall be implemented in TLS protocol.

   The following procedures shall be implemented first before the master
   device contacts to the database using a well-defined access method
   when it has determined the relevant white space database.

   The master device acting as the HTTP client should also act as the
   TLS client.  It should initiate a connection to the white space
   database on the appropriate port and then sent the TLS ClientHello to
   begin the TLS handshake.

   1) The procedure of TLS handshake protocol can be described as
   follows which is based on the [RFC5246]GBP[not]it contains four
   stages:

   a) The first stage: security capabilities including protocol version,
   session ID, cipher suite, compression method, and initial random
   numbers are established

   b) The second stage: certificate of the database, key exchange, and
   request certificate shall be sent by database

   c) The third phase: master device sends certificate if requested.
   Key exchange and certificate verification may be sent by master
   device

   d) The last phase: change cipher suite and finish handshake protocol

   2) Authentication methods

   In above establishment procedure of TLS secure channel, Public key
   certificates or symmetric keys (namely pre-shared keys or PSKs) can
   be used for the mutual authentication between master device and
   database.  In the PSK case, the shared key needs to be pre-configured
   in the master device and in the database by manual operation; When
   the PSK authentication is selected, the certificate and Certificate
   Request payloads are omitted from the response.  The detailed
   procedure can reference the RFC4279.  In the certificate case, the
   master device and database can obtain an operator certificate through
   the enrolment procedure.

Internet-Draft        PAWS security considerations             July 2012


   The use of certificates has advantage that there is a standardized
   procedure for enrolling the private key corresponding to the
   certificate while the use of the PSK requires manual operation for
   establishing the PSK.  On the other hand, the use of PSK has
   advantage that no PKI is required and the procedure after pre-
   establishment of PSK is simple.  When using certificate for mutual
   authentication, a part of the usual certificate handling is replaced
   by subscription handling.

   3) Security protection

   For the completion of the TLS handshake protocol, the
   integrity![cents]confidentially and replay protected are all
   activated, all communications between the master device and the
   database shall be protected by the secure channel.  The further
   authentication of the master device and the white space database
   should be protected by the secure channel if it needed.

4.3.3.  Drawbacks of TLS protocol

   Because the TLS runs over TCP, it is susceptible to a number of
   denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  An attacker who initiates a large
   number of TCP connections can cause a server to consume large amounts
   of CPU for doing RSA decryption.  Besides, attackers can forge RSTs,
   thereby terminating connections, or forge partial TLS records,
   thereby causing the connection to stall.  In this situation,
   implementers or users who are concerned with this class of attack
   should use IPsec.
