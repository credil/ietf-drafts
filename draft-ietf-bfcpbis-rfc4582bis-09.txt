                The Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP)
                    draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis-09

Abstract

   Floor control is a means to manage joint or exclusive access to
   shared resources in a (multiparty) conferencing environment.
   Thereby, floor control complements other functions -- such as
   conference and media session setup, conference policy manipulation,
   and media control -- that are realized by other protocols.

   This document specifies the Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP).
   BFCP is used between floor participants and floor control servers,
   and between floor chairs (i.e., moderators) and floor control
   servers.

   This document obsoletes RFC 4582.  Changes from RFC 4582 are
   summarized in Section 16.

1.  Introduction

   Within a conference, some applications need to manage the access to a
   set of shared resources, such as the right to send media to a
   particular media session.  Floor control enables such applications to
   provide users with coordinated (shared or exclusive) access to these
   resources.

   The Requirements for Floor Control Protocol [11] list a set of
   requirements that need to be met by floor control protocols.  The
   Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP), which is specified in this
   document, meets these requirements.

   In addition, BFCP has been designed so that it can be used in low-
   bandwidth environments.  The binary encoding used by BFCP achieves a
   small message size (when message signatures are not used) that keeps
   the time it takes to transmit delay-sensitive BFCP messages to a
   minimum.  Delay-sensitive BFCP messages include FloorRequest,
   FloorRelease, FloorRequestStatus, and ChairAction.  It is expected
   that future extensions to these messages will not increase the size
   of these messages in a significant way.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Section 2
   defines the terminology used throughout this document, Section 3
   discusses the scope of BFCP (i.e., which tasks fall within the scope
   of BFCP and which ones are performed using different mechanisms),
   Section 4 provides a non-normative overview of BFCP operation, and
   subsequent sections provide the normative specification of BFCP.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

   Media Participant: An entity that has access to the media resources
   of a conference (e.g., it can receive a media stream).  In floor-
   controlled conferences, a given media participant is typically
   colocated with a floor participant, but it does not need to be.
   Third-party floor requests consist of having a floor participant
   request a floor for a media participant when they are not colocated.
   The protocol between a floor participant and a media participant
   (that are not colocated) is outside the scope of this document.

   Client: A floor participant or a floor chair that communicates with a

   floor control server using BFCP.

   Floor: A temporary permission to access or manipulate a specific
   shared resource or set of resources.

   Floor Chair: A logical entity that manages one floor (grants, denies,
   or revokes a floor).  An entity that assumes the logical role of a
   floor chair for a given transaction may assume a different role
   (e.g., floor participant) for a different transaction.  The roles of
   floor chair and floor participant are defined on a transaction-by-
   transaction basis.  BFCP transactions are defined in Section 8.

   Floor Control: A mechanism that enables applications or users to gain
   safe and mutually exclusive or non-exclusive input access to the
   shared object or resource.

   Floor Control Server: A logical entity that maintains the state of
   the floor(s), including which floors exists, who the floor chairs
   are, who holds a floor, etc.  Requests to manipulate a floor are
   directed at the floor control server.  The floor control server of a
   conference may perform other logical roles (e.g., floor participant)
   in another conference.

   Floor Participant: A logical entity that requests floors, and
   possibly information about them, from a floor control server.  An
   entity that assumes the logical role of a floor participant for a
   given transaction may assume a different role (e.g., a floor chair)
   for a different transaction.  The roles of floor participant and
   floor chair are defined on a transaction-by-transaction basis.  BFCP
   transactions are defined in Section 8.  In floor-controlled
   conferences, a given floor participant is typically colocated with a
   media participant, but it does not need to be.  Third-party floor
   requests consist of having a floor participant request a floor for a
   media participant when they are not colocated.

   Participant: An entity that acts as a floor participant, as a media
   participant, or as both.

   BFCP Connection: A transport association between BFCP entities, used
   to exchange BFCP messages.


3.  Scope

   As stated earlier, BFCP is a protocol to coordinate access to shared
   resources in a conference following the requirements defined in [11].

                 Figure 1: Functionality provided by BFCP

   BFCP provides a means:

   o  for floor participants to send floor requests to floor control
      servers.

   o  for floor control servers to grant or deny requests to access a
      given resource from floor participants.

   o  for floor chairs to send floor control servers decisions regarding
      floor requests.

   o  for floor control servers to keep floor participants and floor
      chairs informed about the status of a given floor or a given floor
      request.

   Even though tasks that do not belong to the previous list are outside
   the scope of BFCP, some of these out-of-scope tasks relate to floor
   control and are essential for creating floors and establishing BFCP
   connections between different entities.  In the following
   subsections, we discuss some of these tasks and mechanisms to perform

   them.

3.1.  Floor Creation

   The association of a given floor with a resource or a set of
   resources (e.g., media streams) is out of the scope of BFCP as
   described in [12].  Floor creation and termination are also outside
   the scope of BFCP; these aspects are handled using the conference
   control protocol for manipulating the conference object.
   Consequently, the floor control server needs to stay up to date on
   changes to the conference object (e.g., when a new floor is created).

   Conference control clients using CCMP [17] can specify such floor-
   related settings by editing the floor-information section of the
   to-be created conference object provided in the body of a CCMP
   confRequest/create message issued to the conference control server.

3.2.  Obtaining Information to Contact a Floor Control Server

   A client needs a set of data in order to establish a BFCP connection
   to a floor control server.  These data include the transport address
   of the server, the conference identifier, and a user identifier.

   Clients can obtain this information in different ways.  One is to use
   an SDP offer/answer [10] exchange, which is described in [7].  How to
   establish a connection to a BFCP floor control server outside the
   context of an offer/answer exchange is described in [16].  Other
   mechanisms are described in the XCON framework [12] (and other
   related documents).

3.3.  Obtaining Floor-Resource Associations

   Floors are associated with resources.  For example, a floor that
   controls who talks at a given time has a particular audio session as
   its associated resource.  Associations between floors and resources
   are part of the conference object.

   Floor participants and floor chairs need to know which resources are
   associated with which floors.  They can obtain this information by
   using different mechanisms, such as an SDP offer/answer [10]
   exchange.  How to use an SDP offer/answer exchange to obtain these
   associations is described in [7].

      Note that floor participants perform SDP offer/answer exchanges
      with the conference focus of the conference.  So, the conference
      focus needs to obtain information about associations between
      floors and resources in order to be able to provide this
      information to a floor participant in an SDP offer/answer

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


      exchange.

   Other mechanisms for obtaining this information, including discussion
   of how the information is made available to a (SIP) Focus, are
   described in the XCON framework [12] (and other related documents).
   According to the conferencing system policies, conference control
   clients using CCMP [17] can modify the floor settings of a conference
   by issuing CCMP confRequest/update messages providing the specific
   updates to the <floor-information> section of the target conference
   object.  More information about CCMP and BFCP interaction can be
   found in [18].

3.4.  Privileges of Floor Control

   A participant whose floor request is granted has the right to use (in
   a certain way) the resource or resources associated with the floor
   that was requested.  For example, the participant may have the right
   to send media over a particular audio stream.

   Nevertheless, holding a floor does not imply that others will not be
   able to use its associated resources at the same time, even if they
   do not have the right to do so.  Determination of which media
   participants can actually use the resources in the conference is
   discussed in the XCON Framework [12].


4.  Overview of Operation

   This section provides a non-normative description of BFCP operations.
   Section 4.1 describes the interface between floor participants and
   floor control servers, and Section 4.2 describes the interface
   between floor chairs and floor control servers.

   BFCP messages, which use a TLV (Type-Length-Value) binary encoding,
   consist of a common header followed by a set of attributes.  The
   common header contains, among other information, a 32-bit conference
   identifier.  Floor participants, media participants, and floor chairs
   are identified by 16-bit user identifiers.

   BFCP supports nested attributes (i.e., attributes that contain
   attributes).  These are referred to as grouped attributes.

   There are two types of transactions in BFCP: client-initiated
   transactions and server-initiated transactions.  Section 8 describes
   both types of transactions in detail.

4.1.  Floor Participant to Floor Control Server Interface

   Floor participants request a floor by sending a FloorRequest message
   to the floor control server.  BFCP supports third-party floor
   requests.  That is, the floor participant sending the floor request
   need not be colocated with the media participant that will get the
   floor once the floor request is granted.  FloorRequest messages carry
   the identity of the requester in the User ID field of the common
   header, and the identity of the beneficiary of the floor (in third-
   party floor requests) in a BENEFICIARY-ID attribute.

      Third-party floor requests can be sent, for example, by floor
      participants that have a BFCP connection to the floor control
      server but that are not media participants (i.e., they do not
      handle any media).

   FloorRequest messages identify the floor or floors being requested by
   carrying their 16-bit floor identifiers in FLOOR-ID attributes.  If a
   FloorRequest message carries more than one floor identifier, the
   floor control server treats all the floor requests as an atomic
   package.  That is, the floor control server either grants or denies
   all the floors in the FloorRequest message.

   Floor control servers respond to FloorRequest messages with
   FloorRequestStatus messages, which provide information about the
   status of the floor request.  The first FloorRequestStatus message is
   the response to the FloorRequest message from the client, and
   therefore has the same Transaction ID as the FloorRequest.

   Additionally, the first FloorRequestStatus message carries the Floor
   Request ID in a FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute.  Subsequent
   FloorRequestStatus messages related to the same floor request will
   carry the same Floor Request ID.  This way, the floor participant can
   associate them with the appropriate floor request.

   Messages from the floor participant related to a particular floor
   request also use the same Floor Request ID as the first
   FloorRequestStatus Message from the floor control server.

   Figures 2 and 3 below show examples of call flows where BFCP is used
   over a reliable transport.  Appendix A shows the same call flow
   examples using an unreliable transport.

   Figure 2 shows how a floor participant requests a floor, obtains it,
   and, at a later time, releases it.  This figure illustrates the use,
   among other things, of the Transaction ID and the FLOOR-REQUEST-ID
   attribute.

   Figure 3 shows how a floor participant requests to be informed on the
   status of a floor.  The first FloorStatus message from the floor
   control server is the response to the FloorQuery message and, as
   such, has the same Transaction ID as the FloorQuery message.

   Subsequent FloorStatus messages consist of server-initiated
   transactions, and therefore their Transaction ID is 0.  FloorStatus
   message (2) indicates that there are currently two floor requests for
   the floor whose Floor ID is 543.  FloorStatus message (3) indicates
   that the floor requests with Floor Request ID 764 has been granted,
   and the floor request with Floor Request ID 635 is the first in the
   queue.  FloorStatus message (4) indicates that the floor request with
   Floor Request ID 635 has been granted.

           Figure 3: Obtaining status information about a floor

   FloorStatus messages contain information about the floor requests
   they carry.  For example, FloorStatus message (4) indicates that the
   floor request with Floor Request ID 635 has as the beneficiary (i.e.,
   the participant that holds the floor when a particular floor request
   is granted) the participant whose User ID is 154.  The floor request
   applies only to the floor whose Floor ID is 543.  That is, this is
   not a multi-floor floor request.

      A multi-floor floor request applies to more than one floor (e.g.,
      a participant wants to be able to speak and write on the
      whiteboard at the same time).  The floor control server treats a
      multi-floor floor request as an atomic package.  That is, the
      floor control server either grants the request for all floors or
      denies the request for all floors.

4.2.  Floor Chair to Floor Control Server Interface

   Figure 4 shows a floor chair instructing a floor control server to
   grant a floor.

      Note, however, that although the floor control server needs to
      take into consideration the instructions received in ChairAction
      messages (e.g., granting a floor), it does not necessarily need to
      perform them exactly as requested by the floor chair.  The
      operation that the floor control server performs depends on the
      ChairAction message and on the internal state of the floor control
      server.

   For example, a floor chair may send a ChairAction message granting a
   floor that was requested as part of an atomic floor request operation
   that involved several floors.  Even if the chair responsible for one
   of the floors instructs the floor control server to grant the floor,
   the floor control server will not grant it until the chairs
   responsible for the other floors agree to grant them as well.  In
   another example, a floor chair may instruct the floor control server
   to grant a floor to a participant.  The floor control server needs to
   revoke the floor from its current holder before granting it to the
   new participant.

   So, the floor control server is ultimately responsible for keeping a
   coherent floor state using instructions from floor chairs as input to
   this state.

   transport, i.e. as in [15].  The version field MUST be set to 2 when
   using BFCP over an unreliable transport with the extensions specified
   in this document.  If an endpoint receives a message with an
   unsupported version field value, the receiving server SHOULD send an
   Error message with parameter value 12 (Unsupported Version) to
   indicate this.

   R: The Transaction Responder (R) flag-bit has relevance only for use
   of BFCP over an unreliable transport.  When cleared, it indicates
   that this message is a request initiating a new transaction, and the
   Transaction ID that follows has been generated for this transaction.
   When set, it indicates that this message is a response to a previous
   request, and the Transaction ID that follows is the one associated
   with that request.  When BFCP is used over a reliable transport, the
   flag has no significance and SHOULD be cleared by the sender and MUST
   be ignored by the receiver.

   F: The Fragmentation (F) flag-bit has relevance only for use of BFCP
   over an unreliable transport.  When cleared, the message is not
   fragmented.  When set, it indicates that the message is a fragment of
   a large fragmented BFCP message.  (The optional fields Fragment
   Offset and Fragment Length described below are present only if the F
   flag is set).  When BFCP is used over a reliable transport, the flag
   has no significance and SHOULD be cleared by the sender and MUST be
   ignored by the receiver.

   Res: At this point, the 3 bits in the reserved field SHOULD be set to
   zero by the sender of the message and MUST be ignored by the
   receiver.

   Primitive: This 8-bit field identifies the main purpose of the
   message.  The following primitive values are defined:

                         Table 1: BFCP primitives

   Payload Length: This 16-bit field contains the length of the message
   in 4-octet units, excluding the common header.  If a Floor Control
   Server receives a message with an incorrect Payload Length field
   value, the receiving server SHOULD send an Error message with
   parameter value 13 (Incorrect Message Length) to indicate this.

      Note: BFCP is designed to achieve small message size, as explained
      in Section 1, and BFCP entities are REQUIRED to keep the BFCP
      message size smaller than the size limited by the 16-bit Payload
      Length field.  To convey information not strictly related to floor
      control, other protocols should be used such as the XCON framework
      (cf. Section 3).

   Conference ID: This 32-bit unsigned integer field identifies the
   conference the message belongs to.

   Transaction ID: This field contains a 16-bit value that allows users
   to match a given message with its response (see Section 8).

   User ID: This field contains a 16-bit unsigned integer that uniquely

   identifies a participant within a conference.

      The identity used by a participant in BFCP, which is carried in
      the User ID field, is generally mapped to the identity used by the
      same participant in the session establishment protocol (e.g., in
      SIP).  The way this mapping is performed is outside the scope of
      this specification.

   Fragment Offset: This optional field is present only if the F flag is
   set and contains a 16-bit value that specifies the number of 4-octet
   units contained in previous fragments, excluding the common header.

   Fragment Length: This optional field is present only if the F flag is
   set and contains a 16-bit value that specifies the number of 4-octet
   units contained in this fragment, excluding the common header.

   attribute, identified by its type, has a particular format.  The
   attribute formats defined are:

      Unsigned16: The contents of the attribute consist of a 16-bit
      unsigned integer.

      OctetString16: The contents of the attribute consist of 16 bits of
      arbitrary data.

   M: The 'M' bit, known as the Mandatory bit, indicates whether support
   of the attribute is required.  If a Floor Control Server receives an
   unrecognized attribute with the 'M' bit set the server SHOULD send an
   Error message with parameter value 4 (Unknown Mandatory Attribute) to
   indicate this.  The 'M' bit is significant for extension attributes
   defined in other documents only.  All attributes specified in this
   document MUST be understood by the receiver so that the setting of
   the 'M' bit is irrelevant for these.  In all other cases, the
   unrecognized attribute is ignored but the message is processed.

   length of attributes that are not grouped includes the Type, 'M' bit,
   and Length fields.  The Length in grouped attributes is the length of
   the grouped attribute itself (including Type, 'M' bit, and Length
   fields) plus the total length (including padding) of all the included
   attributes.

   Attribute Contents: The contents of the different attributes are
   defined in the following sections.

5.2.1.  BENEFICIARY-ID

   The following is the format of the BENEFICIARY-ID attribute.


      0                   1                   2                   3

   identifies a user within a conference.

      Note that although the formats of the Beneficiary ID and of the
      User ID field in the common header are similar, their semantics
      are different.  The Beneficiary ID is used in third-party floor
      requests and to request information about a particular
      participant.

5.2.2.  FLOOR-ID

                           +-------+-----------+

                      Table 4: Request Status values

   Queue Position: This 8-bit field contains, when applicable, the
   position of the floor request in the floor request queue at the
   server.  If the Request Status value is different from Accepted, if
   the floor control server does not implement a floor request queue, or
   if the floor control server does not want to provide the client with
   this information, all the bits of this field SHOULD be set to zero.

   A floor request is in Pending state if the floor control server needs
   to contact a floor chair in order to accept the floor request, but
   has not done it yet.  Once the floor control chair accepts the floor
   request, the floor request is moved to the Accepted state.

   Error Code: This 8-bit field contains an error code from the
   following table.  If an error code is not recognized by the receiver,
   then the receiver MUST assume that an error exists, and therefore
   that the original message that triggered the Error message to be sent
   is processed, but the nature of the error is unclear.

      Note: The Generic Error error code is intended to be used by a
      BFCP entity when an error occurs and the other specific error
      codes do not apply.

   Error Specific Details: Present only for certain Error Codes.  In
   this document, only for Error Code 4 (Unknown Mandatory Attribute).
   See Section 5.2.6.1 for its definition.

   Padding: One, two, or three octets of padding added so that the
   contents of the ERROR-CODE attribute is 32-bit aligned.  If the
   attribute is already 32-bit aligned, no padding is needed.

   The Padding bits SHOULD be set to zero by the sender and MUST be
   ignored by the receiver.

   Text: This field contains UTF-8 [6] encoded text.

   In some situations, the contents of the Text field may be generated
   by an automaton.  If this automaton has information about the
   preferred language of the receiver of a particular STATUS-INFO
   attribute, it MAY use this language to generate the Text field.

   Padding: One, two, or three octets of padding added so that the
   contents of the STATUS-INFO attribute is 32-bit aligned.  The Padding
   bits SHOULD be set to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the
   receiver.  If the attribute is already 32-bit aligned, no padding is
   needed.

                        Figure 20: USER-URI format

   Text: This field contains the UTF-8 encoded user's contact URI, that
   is, the URI used by the user to set up the resources (e.g., media
   streams) that are controlled by BFCP.  For example, in the context of
   a conference set up by SIP, the USER-URI attribute would carry the
   SIP URI of the user.

      Messages containing a user's URI in a USER-URI attribute also
      contain the user's User ID.  This way, a client receiving such a
      message can correlate the user's URI (e.g., the SIP URI the user
      used to join a conference) with the user's User ID.

   Padding: One, two, or three octets of padding added so that the
   contents of the USER-URI attribute is 32-bit aligned.  The Padding
   bits SHOULD be set to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the
   receiver.  If the attribute is already 32-bit aligned, no padding is
   needed.

6.  Transport

   The transport over which BFCP entities exchange messages depends on
   how clients obtain information to contact the floor control server
   (e.g., using an SDP offer/answer exchange [7] or the procedure
   specified in [16]).  Two transports are supported: TCP, appropriate
   where connectivity is not impeded by network elements such as NAT
   devices or media relays; and UDP for those deployments where TCP may
   not be applicable or appropriate.

6.1.  Reliable Transport

   BFCP entities may elect to exchange BFCP messages using TCP
   connections.  TCP provides an in-order reliable delivery of a stream
   of bytes.  Consequently, message framing needs to be implemented in
   the application layer.  BFCP implements application-layer framing
   using TLV-encoded attributes.

   A client MUST NOT use more than one TCP connection to communicate
   with a given floor control server within a conference.  Nevertheless,
   if the same physical box handles different clients (e.g., a floor
   chair and a floor participant), which are identified by different
   User IDs, a separate connection per client is allowed.

   If a BFCP entity (a client or a floor control server) receives data
   that cannot be parsed, the entity MUST close the TCP connection, and
   the connection SHOULD be reestablished.  Similarly, if a TCP
   connection cannot deliver a BFCP message and times out or receives an
   ICMP port unreachable message mid-connection, the TCP connection
   SHOULD be reestablished.

   The way connection reestablishment is handled depends on how the
   client obtains information to contact the floor control server.  Once
   the TCP connection is reestablished, the client MAY resend those
   messages for which it did not get a response from the floor control
   server.

   If a floor control server detects that the TCP connection towards one
   of the floor participants is lost, it is up to the local policy of
   the floor control server what to do with the pending floor requests
   of the floor participant.  In any case, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   floor control server keep the floor requests (i.e., that it does not



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 39]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   cancel them) while the TCP connection is reestablished.

   If a client wishes to end its BFCP connection with a floor control
   server, the client closes (i.e., a graceful close) the TCP connection
   towards the floor control server.  If a floor control server wishes
   to end its BFCP connection with a client (e.g., the Focus of the
   conference informs the floor control server that the client has been
   kicked out from the conference), the floor control server closes
   (i.e., a graceful close) the TCP connection towards the client.

6.2.  Unreliable Transport

   BFCP entities may elect to exchange BFCP messages using UDP
   datagrams.  UDP is an unreliable transport where neither delivery nor
   ordering is assured.  Each BFCP UDP datagram MUST contain exactly one
   BFCP message or message fragment.  To keep large BFCP messages from
   being fragmented at the IP layer, the fragmentation of BFCP messages
   that exceed the path MTU size is performed at the BFCP level.
   Considerations related to fragmentation are covered in Section 6.2.3.
   The message format for BFCP messages is the same regardless of
   whether the messages are sent in UDP datagrams or over a TCP stream.

   Clients MUST announce their presence to the floor control server by
   sending a Hello message.  The floor control server responds to the
   Hello message with a HelloAck message.  The client considers the
   floor control service as present and available only upon receiving
   the HelloAck message.

   As described in Section 8, each request sent by a floor participant
   or chair shall form a client transaction that expects an
   acknowledgement message back from the floor control server within a
   retransmission window.  Concordantly, messages sent by the floor
   control server that are not transaction-completing (e.g., FloorStatus
   announcements as part of a FloorQuery subscription) are server-
   initiated transactions that require acknowledgement messages from the
   floor participant and chair entities to which they were sent.

   If a Floor Control Server receives data that cannot be parsed, the
   receiving server SHOULD send an Error message with parameter value 10
   (Unable to parse message) indicating receipt of a malformed message.

   Entities MUST have at most one outstanding request transaction at any
   one time.  Implicit subscriptions occur for a client-initiated
   request transaction whose acknowledgement is implied by the first
   server-initiated response for that transaction, followed by zero of
   more subsequent server-initiated messages corresponding to the same
   transaction.  An example is a FloorRequest message for which there
   are potentially multiple responses from the floor control server as



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 40]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   it processes intermediate states until a terminal state (e.g.,
   Granted or Denied) is attained.  The subsequent changes in state for
   the request are new transactions whose Transaction ID is determined
   by the floor control server and whose receipt by the client
   participant shall be acknowledged with a FloorRequestStatusAck
   message.

   By restricting entities to having at most one pending transaction
   open in a BFCP connection, both the out-of-order receipt of messages
   as well as the possibility for congestion are mitigated.  Additional
   details regarding congestion control are provided in Section 6.2.1.
   A server-initiated request (e.g., a FloorStatus with an update from
   the floor control server) received by a participant before the
   initial FloorRequestStatus message that closes the client-initiated
   transaction that was instigated by the FloorRequest MUST be treated
   as superseding the information conveyed in any such late arriving
   response.  As the floor control server cannot send a second update to
   the implicit floor status subscription until the first is
   acknowledged, ordinality is maintained.

   If a client wishes to end its BFCP connection with a floor control
   server, it is RECOMMENDED that the client send a Goodbye message to
   dissociate itself from any allocated resources.  If a floor control
   server wishes to end its BFCP connection with a client (e.g., the
   Focus of the conference informs the floor control server that the
   client has been kicked out from the conference), it is RECOMMENDED
   that the floor control server send a Goodbye message towards the
   client.

   RFC 5018 [16] specifies how to establish a TCP connection to a floor
   control server outside the context of an offer/answer exchange.  When
   using UDP the same set of data is needed for a BFCP connection as
   listed in [16], Section 3, i.e. transport address of the server, the
   conference identifier, and the user identifier.  The procedures and
   considerations for resolving a host name into an IP address also
   applies to BFCP over an unreliable transport.  In [16], Section 4
   applies, but when using BFCP over an unreliable transport the floor
   control server that receives a BFCP message over UDP (no DTLS) SHOULD
   request the use of DTLS by generating an Error message with an Error
   code with a value of 11 (Use DTLS).  The recommendations for
   authentication in [16], Section 5 and the security considerations in
   Section 6 also apply when an unreliable transport is used, both for
   certificate-based server authentication and for client authentication
   based on a pre-shared secret.

6.2.1.  Congestion Control

   BFCP may be characterized to generate "low data-volume" traffic, per
   the classification in [24].  Nevertheless is it necessary to ensure
   suitable and necessary congestion control mechanisms are used for
   BFCP over UDP.  As described in previous paragraph, within the same
   BFCP connection, every entity - client or server - is only allowed to
   send one request at a time, and await the acknowledging response.
   This way at most one datagram is sent per RTT given the message is
   not lost during transmission.  In case the message is lost, the
   request retransmission timer T1 specified in Section 8.3.1 will fire
   and the message is retransmitted up to three times, in addition to
   the original transmission of the message.  The default initial
   interval is set to 500ms and the interval is doubled after each
   retransmission attempt.  This is identical to the specification of
   the timer A and its initial value T1 in SIP as described in Section
   17.1.1.2 of [14].

6.2.2.  ICMP Error Handling

   If a BFCP entity receives an ICMP port unreachable message mid-
   connection, the entity SHOULD treat the BFCP connection as closed
   (e.g., an implicit Goodbye message from the peer).  The entity MAY
   attempt to re-establish the BFCP connection afresh.  The new BFCP
   connection will appear as originating from a wholly new floor
   participant, chair or floor control server with all state previously
   held about that participant lost.

      Informational note: The recommendation to treat the connection as
      closed in this case, stems from the fact that the peer entities
      cannot rely on IP and port tuple to uniquely identify the
      participant, nor would extending Hello to include an attribute
      that advertised what identity the entity previously was assigned
      (i.e., a User ID) be acceptable due to session hijacking.

   In deployments where NAT appliances or other such devices are present
   and affecting port reachability for each entity, one possibility is
   to utilize the peer connectivity checks, relay use and NAT pinhole
   maintenance mechanisms defined in ICE [13].

6.2.3.  Fragmentation Handling

   When using UDP, a single BFCP message could be fragmented at the IP
   layer if its overall size exceeds the path MTU of the network.  To
   avoid this happening at the IP layer, a fragmentation scheme for BFCP
   is defined below.

   BFCP is designed for achieving small message size, due to the binary



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 42]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   encoding as described in Section 1.  The fragmentation scheme is
   therefore deliberately kept simple and straightforward, since the
   probability of fragmentation of BFCP messages being required is
   small.  By design, the fragmentation scheme does not acknowledge
   individual BFCP message fragments.  The whole BFCP message is
   acknowledged if received completely.

   BFCP entities should consider the MTU size available between the
   sender and the receiver and MAY run MTU discovery, such as
   [19][20][21], for this purpose.

   When transmitting a BFCP message with size greater than the path MTU,
   the sender MUST fragment the message into a series of N contiguous
   data ranges.  The sender then creates N BFCP fragment messages (one
   for each data range) with the same Transaction ID.  The size of each
   of these N messages MUST be smaller than the path MTU.  The F flag in
   the COMMON-HEADER is set to indicate fragmentation of the BFCP
   message.

   For each of these fragments the Fragment Offset and Fragment Length
   fields are included in the COMMON-HEADER.  The Fragment Offset field
   denotes the number of bytes contained in the previous fragments.  The
   Fragment Length contains the length of the fragment itself.  Note
   that the Payload Length field contains the length of the entire,
   unfragmented message.

   When a BFCP implementation receives a BFCP message fragment, it MUST
   buffer the fragment until it has received the entire BFCP message.
   The state machine should handle the BFCP message only after all the
   fragments for the message have been received.

   If a fragment of a BFCP message is lost, the sender will not receive
   an acknowledgement for the message.  Therefore the sender will
   retransmit the message with same transaction ID as specified in
   Section 8.3.  If the acknowledgement message sent by the receiver is
   lost, then the entire message will be resent by the sender.  The
   receiver must then retransmit the acknowledgement.  The receiver MAY
   discard an incomplete buffer utilizing the Response Retransmission
   Timer, starting the timer after the receipt of the first fragment.

      A Denial of Service (DoS) attack utilizing the fragmentation
      scheme described above is mitigated by the fact that the Response
      Retransmission Timer is started after receipt of the first BFCP
      message fragment.  In addition, the Payload Length field may be
      compared with the Fragment Offset and Fragment Length fields to
      verify the message fragments as they arrive.  To make DoS attacks
      with spoofed IP addresses difficult, BFCP entities should use the
      cookie exchange mechanism in DTLS [5].



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 43]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   When deciding message fragment size based on path MTU, the BFCP
   fragmentation handling should take into account how the DTLS record
   framing expands the datagram size as described in Section 4.1.1.1 of
   [5].

6.2.4.  NAT Traversal

   One of the key benefits when using UDP for BFCP communication is the
   ability to leverage the existing NAT traversal infrastructure and
   strategies deployed to facilitate transport of the media associated
   with the video conferencing sessions.  Depending on the given
   deployment, this infrastructure typically includes some subset of ICE
   [13].

   In order to facilitate the initial establishment of NAT bindings, and
   to maintain those bindings once established, BFCP entities using an
   unreliable transport are RECOMMENDED to use STUN [9] Binding
   Indication for keep-alives, as described for ICE [13]. [22], Section
   6.7 provides useful recommendations for middlebox interaction when
   DTLS is used.

      Informational note: Since the version number is set to 2 when BFCP
      is used over an unreliable transport, cf. the Ver field in
      Section 5.1, it is straight forward to distinguish between STUN
      and BFCP packets even without checking the STUN magic cookie [9].

   In order to facilitate traversal of BFCP packets through NATs, BFCP
   entities using an unreliable transport are RECOMMENDED to use
   symmetric ports for sending and receiving BFCP packets, as
   recommended for RTP/RTCP [8].


7.  Lower-Layer Security

   BFCP relies on lower-layer security mechanisms to provide replay and
   integrity protection and confidentiality.  BFCP floor control servers
   and clients (which include both floor participants and floor chairs)
   MUST support TLS for transport over TCP [4] and MUST support DTLS [5]
   for transport over UDP.  Any BFCP entity MAY support other security
   mechanisms.

   BFCP entities MUST support, at a minimum, the
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA ciphersuite [4].

   Which party, the client or the floor control server, acts as the TLS/
   DTLS server depends on how the underlying TLS/DTLS connection is
   established.  For a TCP/TLS connection established using an SDP
   offer/answer exchange [7], the answerer (which may be the client or



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 44]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   the floor control server) always acts as the TLS server.  For a UDP/
   DTLS connection established using the same exchange, either party can
   be the DTLS server depending on the setup attributes exchanged;
   examples can be found in [22].


8.  Protocol Transactions

   In BFCP, there are two types of transactions: client-initiated
   transactions and server-initiated transactions.

   Client-initiated transactions consist of a request from a client to a
   floor control server and a response from the floor control server to
   the client.  The request carries a Transaction ID in its common
   header, which the floor control server copies into the response.
   Clients use Transaction ID values to match responses with previously
   issued requests.

   Server-initiated transactions have different requirements and
   behavior depending on underlying transport:

      When using a reliable transport, server-initiated transactions
      consist of a single message from a floor control server to a
      client (notifications).  Since they do not trigger any response,
      their Transaction ID is set to 0.

      When using an unreliable transport, server-initiated transactions
      consist of a request from a floor control server to a client and a
      response from the client to the floor control server.  The
      Transaction ID must be non-zero and unique in the context of
      outstanding transactions over an unreliable transport.  The
      request carries a Transaction ID in its common header, which the
      client copies into the response.  Floor control servers use
      Transaction ID values to match responses with previously issued
      requests.

   When using BFCP over an unreliable transport, it is important that
   the initiator of a transaction choose a Transaction ID value that
   lets the receiver distinguish the reception of the next message in a
   sequence of BFCP messages from a retransmission of a previous
   message.  Therefore, BFCP entities using an unreliable transport
   SHOULD use monotonically increasing Transaction ID values.

   When using BFCP over an unreliable transport, all requests will use
   retransmission timer T1 (see Section 8.3) until the transaction is

8.1.  Client Behavior

   A client starting a client-initiated transaction MUST set the
   Conference ID in the common header of the message to the Conference
   ID for the conference that the client obtained previously.

   The client MUST set the Transaction ID value in the common header to
   a number that is different from 0 and that MUST NOT be reused in
   another message from the client until a response from the server is
   received for the transaction.  The client uses the Transaction ID
   value to match this message with the response from the floor control
   server.

8.2.  Server Behavior

   A floor control server sending a response within a client-initiated
   transaction MUST copy the Conference ID, the Transaction ID, and the
   User ID from the request received from the client into the response.

   Server-initiated transactions MUST contain a Transaction ID equal to
   0 when BFCP is used over a reliable transport.  Over an unreliable
   transport, the Transaction ID shall have the same properties as for
   client-initiated transactions: the server MUST set the Transaction ID
   value in the common header to a number that is different from 0 and
   that MUST NOT be reused in another message from the server until the
   appropriate response from the client is received for the transaction.
   The server uses the Transaction ID value to match this message with
   the response from the floor participant or floor chair.

8.3.  Timers

   When BFCP entities are communicating over an unreliable transport,
   two retransmission timers are employed to help mitigate against loss
   of datagrams.  Retransmission and response caching are not required
   when BFCP entities communicate over a reliable transport.

8.3.1.  Request Retransmission Timer, T1

   T1 is a timer that schedules retransmission of a request until an
   appropriate response is received or until the maximum number of
   retransmissions have occurred.  The timer doubles on each re-
   transmit, failing after three unacknowledged retransmission attempts.

   If a valid response is not received for a client- or server-initiated
   transaction, the implementation MUST consider the BFCP connection as
   failed.  Implementations SHOULD follow the reestablishment procedure
   described in section 6 (e.g., initiate a new offer/answer [10]
   exchange).

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


8.3.2.  Response Retransmission Timer, T2

   T2 is a timer that, when fires, signals that the BFCP entity can
   release knowledge of the transaction against which it is running.  It
   is started upon the first transmission of the response to a request
   and is the only mechanism by which that response is released by the
   BFCP entity.  Any subsequent retransmissions of the same request can
   be responded to by replaying the cached response, whilst that value
   is retained until the timer has fired.

8.3.3.  Timer Values

   The table below defines the different timers required when BFCP
   entities communicate over an unreliable transport.

        +-------+--------------------------------------+---------+
        | Timer | Description                          | Value/s |
        +-------+--------------------------------------+---------+
        |   T1  | Initial request retransmission timer |   0.5s  |
        |   T2  | Response retransmission timer        |   10s   |
        +-------+--------------------------------------+---------+

                              Table 6: Timers

   The default value for T1 is 500 ms, this is an estimate of the RTT
   for completing the transaction.  T1 MAY be chosen larger, and this is
   RECOMMENDED if it is known in advance that the RTT is larger.
   Regardless of the value of T1, the exponential backoffs on
   retransmissions described in Section 8.3.1 MUST be used.

   T2 SHALL be set such that it encompasses all legal retransmissions
   per T1 plus a factor to accommodate network latency between BFCP
   entities.  The default value is based on the sum of the three
   retransmissions related to T1 using its default value (7.5s) and an
   extra 2.5s is added to take into account potential messages in
   transit due to latency.


9.  Authentication and Authorization

   BFCP clients SHOULD authenticate the floor control server before
   sending any BFCP message to it or accepting any BFCP message from it.
   Similarly, floor control servers SHOULD authenticate a client before
   accepting any BFCP message from it or sending any BFCP message to it.

   BFCP supports TLS/DTLS mutual authentication between clients and
   floor control servers, as specified in Section 9.1.  This is the
   RECOMMENDED authentication mechanism in BFCP.



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 47]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   Note that future extensions may define additional authentication
   mechanisms.

   In addition to authenticating BFCP messages, floor control servers
   need to authorize them.  On receiving an authenticated BFCP message,
   the floor control server checks whether the client sending the
   message is authorized.  If the client is not authorized to perform
   the operation being requested, the floor control server generates an
   Error message, as described in Section 13.8, with an Error code with
   a value of 5 (Unauthorized Operation).  Messages from a client that
   cannot be authorized MUST NOT be processed further.

9.1.  TLS/DTLS Based Mutual Authentication

   BFCP supports TLS/DTLS based mutual authentication between clients
   and floor control servers.  BFCP assumes that there is an integrity-
   protected channel between the client and the floor control server
   that can be used to exchange their self-signed certificates or, more
   commonly, the fingerprints of these certificates.  These certificates
   are used at TLS/DTLS establishment time.

      The implementation of such an integrity-protected channel using
      SIP and the SDP offer/answer model is described in [7].

   BFCP messages received over an authenticated TLS/DTLS connection are
   considered authenticated.  A floor control server that receives a
   BFCP message over TCP/UDP (no TLS/DTLS) can request the use of TLS/
   DTLS by generating an Error message, as described in Section 13.8,
   with an Error code with a value of 9 (Use TLS) or a value of 11 (Use
   DTLS) respectively.  Clients SHOULD simply ignore unauthenticated
   messages.

   Note that future extensions may define additional authentication
   mechanisms that may not require an initial integrity-protected
   channel (e.g., authentication based on certificates signed by a
   certificate authority).

   As described in Section 9, floor control servers need to perform
   authorization before processing any message.  In particular, the
   floor control server SHOULD check that messages arriving over a given
   authenticated TLS/DTLS connection use an authorized User ID (i.e., a
   User ID that the user that established the authenticated TLS/DTLS
   connection is allowed to use).


10.  Floor Participant Operations

   This section specifies how floor participants can perform different



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 48]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   operations, such as requesting a floor, using the protocol elements
   described in earlier sections.  Section 11 specifies operations that
   are specific to floor chairs, such as instructing the floor control
   server to grant or revoke a floor, and Section 12 specifies
   operations that can be performed by any client (i.e., both floor
   participants and floor chairs).

10.1.  Requesting a Floor

   A floor participant that wishes to request one or more floors does so
   by sending a FloorRequest message to the floor control server.

10.1.1.  Sending a FloorRequest Message

   The ABNF in Section 5.3.1 describes the attributes that a
   FloorRequest message can contain.  In addition, the ABNF specifies
   normatively which of these attributes are mandatory, and which ones
   are optional.

   The floor participant sets the Conference ID and the Transaction ID
   in the common header following the rules given in Section 8.1.

   The floor participant sets the User ID in the common header to the
   floor participant's identifier.  This User ID will be used by the
   floor control server to authenticate and authorize the request.  If
   the sender of the FloorRequest message (identified by the User ID) is
   not the participant that would eventually get the floor (i.e., a
   third-party floor request), the sender SHOULD add a BENEFICIARY-ID
   attribute to the message identifying the beneficiary of the floor.

      Note that the name space for both the User ID and the Beneficiary
      ID is the same.  That is, a given participant is identified by a
      single 16-bit value that can be used in the User ID in the common
      header and in several attributes: BENEFICIARY-ID, BENEFICIARY-
      INFORMATION, and REQUESTED-BY-INFORMATION.

   The floor participant must insert at least one FLOOR-ID attribute in
   the FloorRequest message.  If the client inserts more than one
   FLOOR-ID attribute, the floor control server will treat all the floor
   requests as an atomic package.  That is, the floor control server
   will either grant or deny all the floors in the FloorRequest message.

   The floor participant may use a PARTICIPANT-PROVIDED-INFO attribute
   to state the reason why the floor or floors are being requested.  The
   Text field in the PARTICIPANT-PROVIDED-INFO attribute is intended for
   human consumption.

   The floor participant may request that the server handle the floor



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 49]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   request with a certain priority using a PRIORITY attribute.

10.1.2.  Receiving a Response

   A message from the floor control server is considered a response to
   the FloorRequest message if the message from the floor control server
   has the same Conference ID, Transaction ID, and User ID as the
   FloorRequest message, as described in Section 8.1.  On receiving such
   a response, the floor participant follows the rules in Section 9 that
   relate to floor control server authentication.

   The successful processing of a FloorRequest message at the floor
   control server involves generating one or several FloorRequestStatus
   messages.  The floor participant obtains a Floor Request ID in the
   Floor Request ID field of a FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute in
   the first FloorRequestStatus message from the floor control server.
   Subsequent FloorRequestStatus messages from the floor control server
   regarding the same floor request will carry the same Floor Request ID
   in a FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute as the initial
   FloorRequestStatus message.  This way, the floor participant can
   associate subsequent incoming FloorRequestStatus messages with the
   ongoing floor request.

   The floor participant obtains information about the status of the
   floor request in the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute of each of
   the FloorRequestStatus messages received from the floor control
   server.  This attribute is a grouped attribute, and as such it
   includes a number of attributes that provide information about the
   floor request.

   The OVERALL-REQUEST-STATUS attribute provides information about the
   overall status of the floor request.  If the Request Status value is
   Granted, all the floors that were requested in the FloorRequest
   message have been granted.  If the Request Status value is Denied,
   all the floors that were requested in the FloorRequest message have
   been denied.  A floor request is considered to be ongoing while it is
   in the Pending, Accepted, or Granted states.  If the floor request
   value is unknown, then the response is still processed.  However, no
   meaningful value can be reported to the user.

   The STATUS-INFO attribute, if present, provides extra information
   that the floor participant MAY display to the user.

   The FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS attributes provide information about the
   status of the floor request as it relates to a particular floor.  The
   STATUS-INFO attribute, if present, provides extra information that
   the floor participant MAY display to the user.




Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 50]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   The BENEFICIARY-INFORMATION attribute identifies the beneficiary of
   the floor request in third-party floor requests.  The REQUESTED-BY-
   INFORMATION attribute need not be present in FloorRequestStatus
   messages received by the floor participant that requested the floor,
   as this floor participant is already identified by the User ID in the
   common header.

   The PRIORITY attribute, when present, contains the priority that was
   requested by the generator of the FloorRequest message.

   If the response is an Error message, the floor control server could
   not process the FloorRequest message for some reason, which is
   described in the Error message.

10.1.3.  Reception of a Subsequent FloorRequestStatus Message

   When communicating over an unreliable transport and upon receiving a
   FloorRequestStatus message from a floor control server, the
   participant MUST respond with a FloorRequestStatusAck message within
   the transaction failure window to complete the transaction.

10.2.  Cancelling a Floor Request and Releasing a Floor

   A floor participant that wishes to cancel an ongoing floor request
   does so by sending a FloorRelease message to the floor control
   server.  The FloorRelease message is also used by floor participants
   that hold a floor and would like to release it.

10.2.1.  Sending a FloorRelease Message

   The ABNF in Section 5.3.2 describes the attributes that a
   FloorRelease message can contain.  In addition, the ABNF specifies
   normatively which of these attributes are mandatory, and which ones
   are optional.

   The floor participant sets the Conference ID and the Transaction ID
   in the common header following the rules given in Section 8.1.  The
   floor participant sets the User ID in the common header to the floor
   participant's identifier.  This User ID will be used by the floor
   control server to authenticate and authorize the request.

      Note that the FloorRelease message is used to release a floor or
      floors that were granted and to cancel ongoing floor requests
      (from the protocol perspective, both are ongoing floor requests).
      Using the same message in both situations helps resolve the race
      condition that occurs when the FloorRelease message and the
      FloorGrant message cross each other on the wire.




Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 51]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   The floor participant uses the FLOOR-REQUEST-ID that was received in
   the response to the FloorRequest message that the FloorRelease
   message is cancelling.

      Note that if the floor participant requested several floors as an
      atomic operation (i.e., in a single FloorRequest message), all the
      floors are released as an atomic operation as well (i.e., all are
      released at the same time).

10.2.2.  Receiving a Response

   A message from the floor control server is considered a response to
   the FloorRelease message if the message from the floor control server
   has the same Conference ID, Transaction ID, and User ID as the
   FloorRequest message, as described in Section 8.1.  On receiving such
   a response, the floor participant follows the rules in Section 9 that
   relate to floor control server authentication.

   If the response is a FloorRequestStatus message, the Request Status
   value in the OVERALL-REQUEST-STATUS attribute (within the FLOOR-
   REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute) will be Cancelled or Released.

   If the response is an Error message, the floor control server could
   not process the FloorRequest message for some reason, which is
   described in the Error message.

   It is possible that the FloorRelease message crosses on the wire with
   a FloorRequestStatus message from the server with a Request Status
   different from Cancelled or Released.  In any case, such a
   FloorRequestStatus message will not be a response to the FloorRelease
   message, as its Transaction ID will not match that of the
   FloorRelease.


11.  Chair Operations

   This section specifies how floor chairs can instruct the floor
   control server to grant or revoke a floor using the protocol elements
   described in earlier sections.

   Floor chairs that wish to send instructions to a floor control server
   do so by sending a ChairAction message.

11.1.  Sending a ChairAction Message

   The ABNF in Section 5.3.9 describes the attributes that a ChairAction
   message can contain.  In addition, the ABNF specifies normatively
   which of these attributes are mandatory, and which ones are optional.



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 52]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   The floor chair sets the Conference ID and the Transaction ID in the
   common header following the rules given in Section 8.1.  The floor
   chair sets the User ID in the common header to the floor chair's
   identifier.  This User ID will be used by the floor control server to
   authenticate and authorize the request.

   The ChairAction message contains instructions that apply to one or
   more floors within a particular floor request.  The floor or floors
   are identified by the FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS attributes and the floor
   request is identified by the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION-HEADER, which
   are carried in the ChairAction message.

   For example, if a floor request consists of two floors that depend on
   different floor chairs, each floor chair will grant its floor within
   the floor request.  Once both chairs have granted their floor, the
   floor control server will grant the floor request as a whole.  On the
   other hand, if one of the floor chairs denies its floor, the floor
   control server will deny the floor request as a whole, regardless of
   the other floor chair's decision.

   The floor chair provides the new status of the floor request as it
   relates to a particular floor using a FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS attribute.
   If the new status of the floor request is Accepted, the floor chair
   MAY use the Queue Position field to provide a queue position for the
   floor request.  If the floor chair does not wish to provide a queue
   position, all the bits of the Queue Position field SHOULD be set to
   zero.  The floor chair SHOULD use the Status Revoked to revoke a
   floor that was granted (i.e., Granted status) and SHOULD use the
   Status Denied to reject floor requests in any other status (e.g.,
   Pending and Accepted).

   The floor chair MAY add an OVERALL-REQUEST-STATUS attribute to the
   ChairAction message to provide a new overall status for the floor
   request.  If the new overall status of the floor request is Accepted,
   the floor chair MAY use the Queue Position field to provide a queue
   position for the floor request.

      Note that a particular floor control server may implement a
      different queue for each floor containing all the floor requests
      that relate to that particular floor, a general queue for all
      floor requests, or both.  Also note that a floor request may
      involve several floors and that a ChairAction message may only
      deal with a subset of these floors (e.g., if a single floor chair
      is not authorized to manage all the floors).  In this case, the
      floor control server will combine the instructions received from
      the different floor chairs in FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS attributes to
      come up with the overall status of the floor request.




Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 53]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


      Note that, while the action of a floor chair may communicate
      information in the OVERALL-REQUEST-STATUS attribute, the floor
      control server may override, modify, or ignore this field's
      content.

   The floor chair may use STATUS-INFO attributes to state the reason
   why the floor or floors are being accepted, granted, or revoked.  The
   Text in the STATUS-INFO attribute is intended for human consumption.

11.2.  Receiving a Response

   A message from the floor control server is considered a response to
   the ChairAction message if the message from the server has the same
   Conference ID, Transaction ID, and User ID as the ChairAction
   message, as described in Section 8.1.  On receiving such a response,
   the floor chair follows the rules in Section 9 that relate to floor
   control server authentication.

   A ChairActionAck message from the floor control server confirms that
   the floor control server has accepted the ChairAction message.  An
   Error message indicates that the floor control server could not
   process the ChairAction message for some reason, which is described
   in the Error message.


12.  General Client Operations

   This section specifies operations that can be performed by any
   client.  That is, they are not specific to floor participants or
   floor chairs.  They can be performed by both.

12.1.  Requesting Information about Floors

   A client can obtain information about the status of a floor or floors
   in different ways, which include using BFCP and using out-of-band
   mechanisms.  Clients using BFCP to obtain such information use the
   procedures described in this section.

   Clients request information about the status of one or several floors
   by sending a FloorQuery message to the floor control server.

12.1.1.  Sending a FloorQuery Message

   The ABNF in Section 5.3.7 describes the attributes that a FloorQuery
   message can contain.  In addition, the ABNF specifies normatively
   which of these attributes are mandatory, and which ones are optional.

   The client sets the Conference ID and the Transaction ID in the



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 54]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   common header following the rules given in Section 8.1.  The client
   sets the User ID in the common header to the client's identifier.
   This User ID will be used by the floor control server to authenticate
   and authorize the request.

   The client inserts in the message all the Floor IDs it wants to
   receive information about.  The floor control server will send
   periodic information about all of these floors.  If the client does
   not want to receive information about a particular floor any longer,
   it sends a new FloorQuery message removing the FLOOR-ID of this
   floor.  If the client does not want to receive information about any
   floor any longer, it sends a FloorQuery message with no FLOOR-ID
   attribute.

12.1.2.  Receiving a Response

   A message from the floor control server is considered a response to
   the FloorQuery message if the message from the floor control server
   has the same Conference ID, Transaction ID, and User ID as the
   FloorRequest message, as described in Section 8.1.  On receiving such
   a response, the client follows the rules in Section 9 that relate to
   floor control server authentication.

   On reception of the FloorQuery message, the floor control server will
   respond with a FloorStatus message or with an Error message.  If the
   response is a FloorStatus message, it will contain information about
   one of the floors the client requested information about.  If the
   client did not include any FLOOR-ID attribute in its FloorQuery
   message (i.e., the client does not want to receive information about
   any floor any longer), the FloorStatus message from the floor control
   server will not include any FLOOR-ID attribute either.

   FloorStatus messages that carry information about a floor contain a
   FLOOR-ID attribute that identifies the floor.  After this attribute,
   FloorStatus messages contain information about existing (one or more)
   floor requests that relate to that floor.  The information about each
   particular floor request is encoded in a FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION
   attribute.  This grouped attribute carries a Floor Request ID that
   identifies the floor request, followed by a set of attributes that
   provide information about the floor request.

   After the first FloorStatus, the floor control server will continue
   sending FloorStatus messages, periodically informing the client about
   changes on the floors the client requested information about.

12.1.3.  Reception of a Subsequent FloorStatus Message

   When communicating over an unreliable transport and upon receiving a
   FloorStatus message from a floor control server, the participant MUST
   respond with a FloorStatusAck message within the transaction failure
   window to complete the transaction.

12.2.  Requesting Information about Floor Requests

   A client can obtain information about the status of one or several
   floor requests in different ways, which include using BFCP and using
   out-of-band mechanisms.  Clients using BFCP to obtain such
   information use the procedures described in this section.

   Clients request information about the current status of a floor
   request by sending a FloorRequestQuery message to the floor control
   server.

   Requesting information about a particular floor request is useful in
   a number of situations.  For example, on reception of a FloorRequest
   message, a floor control server may choose to return
   FloorRequestStatus messages only when the floor request changes its
   state (e.g., from Accepted to Granted), but not when the floor
   request advances in its queue.  In this situation, if the user
   requests it, the floor participant can use a FloorRequestQuery
   message to poll the floor control server for the status of the floor
   request.

12.2.1.  Sending a FloorRequestQuery Message

   The ABNF in Section 5.3.3 describes the attributes that a
   FloorRequestQuery message can contain.  In addition, the ABNF
   specifies normatively which of these attributes are mandatory, and
   which ones are optional.

   The client sets the Conference ID and the Transaction ID in the
   common header following the rules given in Section 8.1.  The client
   sets the User ID in the common header to the client's identifier.
   This User ID will be used by the floor control server to authenticate
   and authorize the request.

   The client must insert a FLOOR-REQUEST-ID attribute that identifies
   the floor request at the floor control server.

12.2.2.  Receiving a Response

   A message from the floor control server is considered a response to
   the FloorRequestQuery message if the message from the floor control

   server has the same Conference ID, Transaction ID, and User ID as the
   FloorRequestQuery message, as described in Section 8.1.  On receiving
   such a response, the client follows the rules in Section 9 that
   relate to floor control server authentication.

   If the response is a FloorRequestStatus message, the client obtains
   information about the status of the FloorRequest the client requested
   information about in a FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute.

   If the response is an Error message, the floor control server could
   not process the FloorRequestQuery message for some reason, which is
   described in the Error message.

12.3.  Requesting Information about a User

   A client can obtain information about a participant and the floor
   requests related to this participant in different ways, which include
   using BFCP and using out-of-band mechanisms.  Clients using BFCP to
   obtain such information use the procedures described in this section.

   Clients request information about a participant and the floor
   requests related to this participant by sending a UserQuery message
   to the floor control server.

   This functionality may be useful for floor chairs or floor
   participants interested in the display name and the URI of a
   particular floor participant.  In addition, a floor participant may
   find it useful to request information about itself.  For example, a
   floor participant, after experiencing connectivity problems (e.g.,
   its TCP connection with the floor control server was down for a while
   and eventually was re-established), may need to request information
   about all the floor requests associated to itself that still exist.

12.3.1.  Sending a UserQuery Message

   The ABNF in Section 5.3.5 describes the attributes that a UserQuery
   message can contain.  In addition, the ABNF specifies normatively
   which of these attributes are mandatory, and which ones are optional.

   The client sets the Conference ID and the Transaction ID in the
   common header following the rules given in Section 8.1.  The client
   sets the User ID in the common header to the client's identifier.
   This User ID will be used by the floor control server to authenticate
   and authorize the request.

   If the floor participant the client is requesting information about
   is not the client issuing the UserQuery message (which is identified
   by the User ID in the common header of the message), the client MUST

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   insert a BENEFICIARY-ID attribute.

12.3.2.  Receiving a Response

   A message from the floor control server is considered a response to
   the UserQuery message if the message from the floor control server
   has the same Conference ID, Transaction ID, and User ID as the
   UserQuery message, as described in Section 8.1.  On receiving such a
   response, the client follows the rules in Section 9 that relate to
   floor control server authentication.

   If the response is a UserStatus message, the client obtains
   information about the floor participant in a BENEFICIARY-INFORMATION
   grouped attribute and about the status of the floor requests
   associated with the floor participant in FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION
   attributes.

   If the response is an Error message, the floor control server could
   not process the UserQuery message for some reason, which is described
   in the Error message.

12.4.  Obtaining the Capabilities of a Floor Control Server

   A client that wishes to obtain the capabilities of a floor control
   server does so by sending a Hello message to the floor control
   server.

12.4.1.  Sending a Hello Message

   The ABNF in Section 5.3.11 describes the attributes that a Hello
   message can contain.  In addition, the ABNF specifies normatively
   which of these attributes are mandatory, and which ones are optional.

   The client sets the Conference ID and the Transaction ID in the
   common header following the rules given in Section 8.1.  The client
   sets the User ID in the common header to the client's identifier.
   This User ID will be used by the floor control server to authenticate
   and authorize the request.

12.4.2.  Receiving Responses

   A message from the floor control server is considered a response to
   the Hello message by the client if the message from the floor control
   server has the same Conference ID, Transaction ID, and User ID as the
   Hello message, as described in Section 8.1.  On receiving such a
   response, the client follows the rules in Section 9 that relate to
   floor control server authentication.

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   If the response is a HelloAck message, the floor control server could
   process the Hello message successfully.  The SUPPORTED-PRIMITIVES and
   SUPPORTED-ATTRIBUTES attributes indicate which primitives and
   attributes, respectively, are supported by the server.

   If the response is an Error message, the floor control server could
   not process the Hello message for some reason, which is described in
   the Error message.


13.  Floor Control Server Operations

   This section specifies how floor control servers can perform
   different operations, such as granting a floor, using the protocol
   elements described in earlier sections.

   On reception of a message from a client, the floor control server
   MUST check whether the value of the Primitive is supported.  If it is
   not, the floor control server SHOULD send an Error message, as
   described in Section 13.8, with Error code 3 (Unknown Primitive).

   On reception of a message from a client, the floor control server
   MUST check whether the value of the Conference ID matched an existing
   conference.  If it does not, the floor control server SHOULD send an
   Error message, as described in Section 13.8, with Error code 1
   (Conference does not Exist).

   On reception of a message from a client, the floor control server
   follows the rules in Section 9 that relate to the authentication of
   the message.

   On reception of a message from a client, the floor control server
   MUST check whether it understands all the mandatory ('M' bit set)
   attributes in the message.  If the floor control server does not
   understand all of them, the floor control server SHOULD send an Error
   message, as described in Section 13.8, with Error code 4 (Unknown
   Mandatory Attribute).  The Error message SHOULD list the attributes
   that were not understood.

13.1.  Reception of a FloorRequest Message

   On reception of a FloorRequest message, the floor control server
   follows the rules in Section 9 that relate to client authentication
   and authorization.  If while processing the FloorRequest message, the
   floor control server encounters an error, it SHOULD generate an Error
   response following the procedures described in Section 13.8.





Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 59]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


      BFCP allows floor participants to have several ongoing floor
      requests for the same floor (e.g., the same floor participant can
      occupy more than one position in a queue at the same time).  A
      floor control server that only supports a certain number of
      ongoing floor requests per floor participant (e.g., one) can use
      Error Code 8 (You have Already Reached the Maximum Number of
      Ongoing Floor Requests for this Floor) to inform the floor
      participant.

   When communicating over an unreliable transport and upon receiving a
   FloorRequest from a participant, the floor control server MUST
   respond with a FloorRequestStatus message within the transaction
   failure window to complete the transaction.

13.1.1.  Generating the First FloorRequestStatus Message

   The successful processing of a FloorRequest message by a floor
   control server involves generating one or several FloorRequestStatus
   messages, the first of which SHOULD be generated as soon as possible.
   If the floor control server cannot accept, grant, or deny the floor
   request right away (e.g., a decision from a chair is needed), it
   SHOULD use a Request Status value of Pending in the OVERALL-REQUEST-
   STATUS attribute (within the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped
   attribute) of the first FloorRequestStatus message it generates.

      The policy that a floor control server follows to grant or deny
      floors is outside the scope of this document.  A given floor
      control server may perform these decisions automatically while
      another may contact a human acting as a chair every time a
      decision needs to be made.

   The floor control server MUST copy the Conference ID, the Transaction
   ID, and the User ID from the FloorRequest into the
   FloorRequestStatus, as described in Section 8.2.  Additionally, the
   floor control server MUST add a FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped
   attribute to the FloorRequestStatus.  The attributes contained in
   this grouped attribute carry information about the floor request.

   The floor control server MUST assign an identifier that is unique
   within the conference to this floor request, and MUST insert it in
   the Floor Request ID field of the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION
   attribute.  This identifier will be used by the floor participant (or
   by a chair or chairs) to refer to this specific floor request in the
   future.

   The floor control server MUST copy the Floor IDs in the FLOOR-ID
   attributes of the FloorRequest into the FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS
   attributes in the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute.  These



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 60]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   Floor IDs identify the floors being requested (i.e., the floors
   associated with this particular floor request).

   The floor control server SHOULD copy (if present) the contents of the
   BENEFICIARY-ID attribute from the FloorRequest into a BENEFICIARY-
   INFORMATION attribute inside the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped
   attribute.  Additionally, the floor control server MAY provide the
   display name and the URI of the beneficiary in this BENEFICIARY-
   INFORMATION attribute.

   The floor control server MAY provide information about the requester
   of the floor in a REQUESTED-BY-INFORMATION attribute inside the
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute.

   The floor control server MAY copy (if present) the PRIORITY attribute
   from the FloorRequest into the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped
   attribute.

      Note that this attribute carries the priority requested by the
      participant.  The priority that the floor control server assigns
      to the floor request depends on the priority requested by the
      participant and the rights the participant has according to the
      policy of the conference.  For example, a participant that is only
      allowed to use the Normal priority may request Highest priority
      for a floor request.  In that case, the floor control server would
      ignore the priority requested by the participant.

   The floor control server MAY copy (if present) the PARTICIPANT-
   PROVIDED-INFO attribute from the FloorRequest into the FLOOR-REQUEST-
   INFORMATION grouped attribute.

13.1.2.  Generation of Subsequent FloorRequestStatus Messages

   A floor request is considered to be ongoing as long as it is not in
   the Cancelled, Released, or Revoked states.  If the OVERALL-REQUEST-
   STATUS attribute (inside the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped
   attribute) of the first FloorRequestStatus message generated by the
   floor control server did not indicate any of these states, the floor
   control server will need to send subsequent FloorRequestStatus
   messages.

   When the status of the floor request changes, the floor control
   server SHOULD send new FloorRequestStatus messages with the
   appropriate Request Status.  The floor control server MUST add a
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute with a Floor Request ID equal to
   the one sent in the first FloorRequestStatus message to any new
   FloorRequestStatus related to the same floor request.  (The Floor
   Request ID identifies the floor request to which the



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 61]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   FloorRequestStatus applies.)

   When using BFCP over a reliable transport, the floor control server
   MUST set the Transaction ID of subsequent FloorRequestStatus messages
   to 0.  When using BFCP over an unreliable transport, the Transaction
   ID MUST be non-zero and unique in the context of outstanding
   transactions over an unreliable transport as described in Section 8.

      The rate at which the floor control server sends
      FloorRequestStatus messages is a matter of local policy.  A floor
      control server may choose to send a new FloorRequestStatus message
      every time the floor request moves in the floor request queue,
      while another may choose only to send a new FloorRequestStatus
      message when the floor request is Granted or Denied.

   The floor control server may add a STATUS-INFO attribute to any of
   the FloorRequestStatus messages it generates to provide extra
   information about its decisions regarding the floor request (e.g.,
   why it was denied).

      Floor participants and floor chairs may request to be informed
      about the status of a floor following the procedures in
      Section 12.1.  If the processing of a floor request changes the
      status of a floor (e.g., the floor request is granted and
      consequently the floor has a new holder), the floor control server
      needs to follow the procedures in Section 13.5 to inform the
      clients that have requested that information.

   The common header and the rest of the attributes are the same as in
   the first FloorRequestStatus message.

   The floor control server can discard the state information about a
   particular floor request when this reaches a status of Cancelled,
   Released, or Revoked.

   When communicating over an unreliable transport and a
   FloorRequestStatusAck message is not received within the transaction
   failure window, the floor control server MUST retransmit the
   FloorRequestStatus message according to Section 6.2.

13.2.  Reception of a FloorRequestQuery Message

   On reception of a FloorRequestQuery message, the floor control server
   follows the rules in Section 9 that relate to client authentication
   and authorization.  If while processing the FloorRequestQuery
   message, the floor control server encounters an error, it SHOULD
   generate an Error response following the procedures described in
   Section 13.8.

   The successful processing of a FloorRequestQuery message by a floor
   control server involves generating a FloorRequestStatus message,
   which SHOULD be generated as soon as possible.

   When communicating over an unreliable transport and upon receiving a
   FloorRequestQuery from a participant, the floor control server MUST
   respond with a FloorRequestStatus message within the transaction
   failure window to complete the transaction.

   The floor control server MUST copy the Conference ID, the Transaction
   ID, and the User ID from the FloorRequestQuery message into the
   FloorRequestStatus message, as described in Section 8.2.
   Additionally, the floor control server MUST include information about
   the floor request in the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute
   to the FloorRequestStatus.

   The floor control server MUST copy the contents of the
   FLOOR-REQUEST-ID attribute from the FloorRequestQuery message into
   the Floor Request ID field of the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION
   attribute.

   The floor control server MUST add FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS attributes to
   the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute identifying the
   floors being requested (i.e., the floors associated with the floor
   request identified by the FLOOR-REQUEST-ID attribute).

   The floor control server SHOULD add a BENEFICIARY-ID attribute to the
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute identifying the
   beneficiary of the floor request.  Additionally, the floor control
   server MAY provide the display name and the URI of the beneficiary in
   this BENEFICIARY-INFORMATION attribute.

   The floor control server MAY provide information about the requester
   of the floor in a REQUESTED-BY-INFORMATION attribute inside the
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute.

   The floor control server MAY provide the reason why the floor
   participant requested the floor in a PARTICIPANT-PROVIDED-INFO.

   The floor control server MAY also add to the FLOOR-REQUEST-
   INFORMATION grouped attribute a PRIORITY attribute with the Priority
   value requested for the floor request and a STATUS-INFO attribute
   with extra information about the floor request.

   The floor control server MUST add an OVERALL-REQUEST-STATUS attribute
   to the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute with the current
   status of the floor request.  The floor control server MAY provide
   information about the status of the floor request as it relates to

   each of the floors being requested in the FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS
   attributes.

13.3.  Reception of a UserQuery Message

   On reception of a UserQuery message, the floor control server follows
   the rules in Section 9 that relate to client authentication and
   authorization.  If while processing the UserQuery message, the floor
   control server encounters an error, it SHOULD generate an Error
   response following the procedures described in Section 13.8.

   The successful processing of a UserQuery message by a floor control
   server involves generating a UserStatus message, which SHOULD be
   generated as soon as possible.

   When communicating over an unreliable transport and upon receiving a
   UserQuery from a participant, the floor control server MUST respond
   with a UserStatus message within the transaction failure window to
   complete the transaction.

   The floor control server MUST copy the Conference ID, the Transaction
   ID, and the User ID from the UserQuery message into the USerStatus
   message, as described in Section 8.2.

   The sender of the UserQuery message is requesting information about
   all the floor requests associated with a given participant (i.e., the
   floor requests where the participant is either the beneficiary or the
   requester).  This participant is identified by a BENEFICIARY-ID
   attribute or, in the absence of a BENEFICIARY-ID attribute, by a the
   User ID in the common header of the UserQuery message.

   The floor control server MUST copy, if present, the contents of the
   BENEFICIARY-ID attribute from the UserQuery message into a
   BENEFICIARY-INFORMATION attribute in the UserStatus message.
   Additionally, the floor control server MAY provide the display name
   and the URI of the participant about which the UserStatus message
   provides information in this BENEFICIARY-INFORMATION attribute.

   The floor control server SHOULD add to the UserStatus message a
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute for each floor request
   related to the participant about which the message provides
   information (i.e., the floor requests where the participant is either
   the beneficiary or the requester).  For each FLOOR-REQUEST-
   INFORMATION attribute, the floor control server follows the following
   steps.

   The floor control server MUST identify the floor request the FLOOR-
   REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute applies to by filling the Floor Request



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 64]

   ID field of the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute.

   The floor control server MUST add FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS attributes to
   the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute identifying the
   floors being requested (i.e., the floors associated with the floor
   request identified by the FLOOR-REQUEST-ID attribute).

   The floor control server SHOULD add a BENEFICIARY-ID attribute to the
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute identifying the
   beneficiary of the floor request.  Additionally, the floor control
   server MAY provide the display name and the URI of the beneficiary in
   this BENEFICIARY-INFORMATION attribute.

   The floor control server MAY provide information about the requester
   of the floor in a REQUESTED-BY-INFORMATION attribute inside the
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute.

   The floor control server MAY provide the reason why the floor
   participant requested the floor in a PARTICIPANT-PROVIDED-INFO.

   The floor control server MAY also add to the FLOOR-REQUEST-
   INFORMATION grouped attribute a PRIORITY attribute with the Priority
   value requested for the floor request.

   The floor control server MUST include the current status of the floor
   request in an OVERALL-REQUEST-STATUS attribute to the FLOOR-REQUEST-
   INFORMATION grouped attribute.  The floor control server MAY add a
   STATUS-INFO attribute with extra information about the floor request.

   The floor control server MAY provide information about the status of
   the floor request as it relates to each of the floors being requested
   in the FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS attributes.

13.4.  Reception of a FloorRelease Message

   On reception of a FloorRelease message, the floor control server
   follows the rules in Section 9 that relate to client authentication
   and authorization.  If while processing the FloorRelease message, the
   floor control server encounters an error, it SHOULD generate an Error
   response following the procedures described in Section 13.8.

   The successful processing of a FloorRelease message by a floor
   control server involves generating a FloorRequestStatus message,
   which SHOULD be generated as soon as possible.

   When communicating over an unreliable transport and upon receiving a
   FloorRelease from a participant, the floor control server MUST
   respond with a FloorRequestStatus message within the transaction



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 65]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   failure window to complete the transaction.

   The floor control server MUST copy the Conference ID, the Transaction
   ID, and the User ID from the FloorRelease message into the
   FloorRequestStatus message, as described in Section 8.2.

   The floor control server MUST add a FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped
   attribute to the FloorRequestStatus.  The attributes contained in
   this grouped attribute carry information about the floor request.

   The FloorRelease message identifies the floor request it applies to
   using a FLOOR-REQUEST-ID.  The floor control server MUST copy the
   contents of the FLOOR-REQUEST-ID attribute from the FloorRelease
   message into the Floor Request ID field of the FLOOR-REQUEST-
   INFORMATION attribute.

   The floor control server MUST identify the floors being released
   (i.e., the floors associated with the floor request identified by the
   FLOOR-REQUEST-ID attribute) in FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS attributes to the
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute.

   The floor control server MUST add an OVERALL-REQUEST-STATUS attribute
   to the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute.  The Request
   Status value SHOULD be Released, if the floor (or floors) had been
   previously granted, or Cancelled, if the floor (or floors) had not
   been previously granted.  The floor control server MAY add a STATUS-
   INFO attribute with extra information about the floor request.

13.5.  Reception of a FloorQuery Message

   On reception of a FloorQuery message, the floor control server
   follows the rules in Section 9 that relate to client authentication.
   If while processing the FloorQuery message, the floor control server
   encounters an error, it SHOULD generate an Error response following
   the procedures described in Section 13.8.

   When communicating over an unreliable transport and upon receiving a
   FloorQuery from a participant, the floor control server MUST respond
   with a FloorStatus message within the transaction failure window to
   complete the transaction.

   A floor control server receiving a FloorQuery message from a client
   SHOULD keep this client informed about the status of the floors
   identified by FLOOR-ID attributes in the FloorQuery message.  Floor
   Control Servers keep clients informed by using FloorStatus messages.

   An individual FloorStatus message carries information about a single
   floor.  So, when a FloorQuery message requests information about more



Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 66]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   than one floor, the floor control server needs to send separate
   FloorStatus messages for different floors.

   The information FloorQuery messages carry may depend on the user
   requesting the information.  For example, a chair may be able to
   receive information about pending requests, while a regular user may
   not be authorized to do so.

13.5.1.  Generation of the First FloorStatus Message

   The successful processing of a FloorQuery message by a floor control
   server involves generating one or several FloorStatus messages, the
   first of which SHOULD be generated as soon as possible.

   The floor control server MUST copy the Conference ID, the Transaction
   ID, and the User ID from the FloorQuery message into the FloorStatus
   message, as described in Section 8.2.

   If the FloorQuery message did not contain any FLOOR-ID attribute, the
   floor control server sends the FloorStatus message without adding any
   additional attribute and does not send any subsequent FloorStatus
   message to the floor participant.

   If the FloorQuery message contained one or more FLOOR-ID attributes,
   the floor control server chooses one from among them and adds this
   FLOOR-ID attribute to the FloorStatus message.  The floor control
   server SHOULD add a FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute for
   each floor request associated to the floor.  Each FLOOR-REQUEST-
   INFORMATION grouped attribute contains a number of attributes that
   provide information about the floor request.  For each FLOOR-REQUEST-
   INFORMATION attribute, the floor control server follows the following
   steps.

   The floor control server MUST identify the floor request the FLOOR-
   REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute applies to by filling the Floor Request
   ID field of the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute.

   The floor control server MUST add FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS attributes to
   the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute identifying the
   floors being requested (i.e., the floors associated with the floor
   request identified by the FLOOR-REQUEST-ID attribute).

   The floor control server SHOULD add a BENEFICIARY-ID attribute to the
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute identifying the
   beneficiary of the floor request.  Additionally, the floor control
   server MAY provide the display name and the URI of the beneficiary in
   this BENEFICIARY-INFORMATION attribute.




Camarillo, et al.       Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 67]

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   The floor control server MAY provide information about the requester
   of the floor in a REQUESTED-BY-INFORMATION attribute inside the
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute.

   The floor control server MAY provide the reason why the floor
   participant requested the floor in a PARTICIPANT-PROVIDED-INFO.

   The floor control server MAY also add to the FLOOR-REQUEST-
   INFORMATION grouped attribute a PRIORITY attribute with the Priority
   value requested for the floor request.

   The floor control server MUST add an OVERALL-REQUEST-STATUS attribute
   to the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute with the current
   status of the floor request.  The floor control server MAY add a
   STATUS-INFO attribute with extra information about the floor request.

   The floor control server MAY provide information about the status of
   the floor request as it relates to each of the floors being requested
   in the FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS attributes.

13.5.2.  Generation of Subsequent FloorStatus Messages

   If the FloorQuery message carried more than one FLOOR-ID attribute,
   the floor control server SHOULD generate a FloorStatus message for
   each of them (except for the FLOOR-ID attribute chosen for the first
   FloorStatus message) as soon as possible.  These FloorStatus messages
   are generated following the same rules as those for the first
   FloorStatus message (see Section 13.5.1), but their Transaction ID is
   0 when using a reliable transport and non-zero and unique in the
   context of outstanding transactions when using an unreliable
   transport (cf. Section 8).

   After generating these messages, the floor control server sends
   FloorStatus messages, periodically keeping the client informed about
   all the floors for which the client requested information.  The
   Transaction ID of these messages MUST be 0 when using a reliable
   transport and non-zero and unique in the context of outstanding
   transactions when using an unreliable transport (cf. Section 8).

      The rate at which the floor control server sends FloorStatus
      messages is a matter of local policy.  A floor control server may
      choose to send a new FloorStatus message every time a new floor
      request arrives, while another may choose to only send a new
      FloorStatus message when a new floor request is Granted.

   When communicating over an unreliable transport and a FloorStatusAck
   message is not received within the transaction failure window, the
   floor control server MUST retransmit the FloorStatus message

   according to Section 6.2.

13.6.  Reception of a ChairAction Message

   On reception of a ChairAction message, the floor control server
   follows the rules in Section 9 that relate to client authentication
   and authorization.  If while processing the ChairAction message, the
   floor control server encounters an error, it SHOULD generate an Error
   response following the procedures described in Section 13.8.

   The successful processing of a ChairAction message by a floor control
   server involves generating a ChairActionAck message, which SHOULD be
   generated as soon as possible.

   When communicating over an unreliable transport and upon receiving a
   ChairAction from a chair, the floor control server MUST respond with
   a ChairActionAck message within the transaction failure window to
   complete the transaction.

   The floor control server MUST copy the Conference ID, the Transaction
   ID, and the User ID from the ChairAction message into the
   ChairActionAck message, as described in Section 8.2.

   The floor control server needs to take into consideration the
   operation requested in the ChairAction message (e.g., granting a
   floor) but does not necessarily need to perform it as requested by
   the floor chair.  The operation that the floor control server
   performs depends on the ChairAction message and on the internal state
   of the floor control server.

   For example, a floor chair may send a ChairAction message granting a
   floor that was requested as part of an atomic floor request operation
   that involved several floors.  Even if the chair responsible for one
   of the floors instructs the floor control server to grant the floor,
   the floor control server will not grant it until the chairs
   responsible for the other floors agree to grant them as well.

   So, the floor control server is ultimately responsible for keeping a
   coherent floor state using instructions from floor chairs as input to
   this state.

   If the new Status in the ChairAction message is Accepted and all the
   bits of the Queue Position field are zero, the floor chair is
   requesting that the floor control server assign a queue position
   (e.g., the last in the queue) to the floor request based on the local
   policy of the floor control server.  (Of course, such a request only
   applies if the floor control server implements a queue.)

13.7.  Reception of a Hello Message

   On reception of a Hello message, the floor control server follows the
   rules in Section 9 that relate to client authentication.  If while
   processing the Hello message, the floor control server encounters an
   error, it SHOULD generate an Error response following the procedures
   described in Section 13.8.

   If the version of BFCP specified in the Version field of the COMMON-
   HEADER is supported by the floor control server, it MUST respond with
   the same version number in the HelloAck; this defines the version for
   all subsequent BFCP messages within this BFCP Connection.  If the
   version given in the Hello message is not supported, the receiving
   server MUST instead send an Error message with parameter value 12
   (Unsupported Version).

   When communicating over an unreliable transport and upon receiving a
   Hello from a participant, the floor control server MUST respond with
   a HelloAck message within the transaction failure window to complete
   the transaction.

   The successful processing of a Hello message by a floor control
   server involves generating a HelloAck message, which SHOULD be
   generated as soon as possible.  The floor control server MUST copy
   the Conference ID, the Transaction ID, and the User ID from the Hello
   into the HelloAck, as described in Section 8.2.

   The floor control server MUST add a SUPPORTED-PRIMITIVES attribute to
   the HelloAck message listing all the primitives (i.e., BFCP messages)
   supported by the floor control server.

   The floor control server MUST add a SUPPORTED-ATTRIBUTES attribute to
   the HelloAck message listing all the attributes supported by the
   floor control server.

13.8.  Error Message Generation

   Error messages are always sent in response to a previous message from
   the client as part of a client-initiated transaction.  The ABNF in
   Section 5.3.13 describes the attributes that an Error message can
   contain.  In addition, the ABNF specifies normatively which of these
   attributes are mandatory and which ones are optional.

   The floor control server MUST copy the Conference ID, the Transaction
   ID, and the User ID from the message from the client into the Error
   message, as described in Section 8.2.

   The floor control server MUST add an ERROR-CODE attribute to the

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   Error message.  The ERROR-CODE attribute contains an Error Code from
   Table 5.  Additionally, the floor control server may add an ERROR-
   INFO attribute with extra information about the error.


14.  Security Considerations

   BFCP uses TLS/DTLS to provide mutual authentication between clients
   and servers.  TLS/DTLS also provides replay and integrity protection
   and confidentiality.  It is RECOMMENDED that TLS/DTLS with non-null
   encryption always be used.  BFCP entities MAY use other security
   mechanisms as long as they provide similar security properties.

   The remainder of this section analyzes some of the threats against
   BFCP and how they are addressed.

   An attacker may attempt to impersonate a client (a floor participant
   or a floor chair) in order to generate forged floor requests or to
   grant or deny existing floor requests.  Client impersonation is
   avoided by having servers only accept BFCP messages over
   authenticated TLS/DTLS connections.  The floor control server assumes
   that attackers cannot high-jack the TLS/DTLS connection and,
   therefore, that messages over the TLS/DTLS connection come from the
   client that was initially authenticated.

   An attacker may attempt to impersonate a floor control server.  A
   successful attacker would be able to make clients think that they
   hold a particular floor so that they would try to access a resource
   (e.g., sending media) without having legitimate rights to access it.
   Floor control server impersonation is avoided by having servers only
   accept BFCP messages over authenticated TLS/DTLS connections, as well
   as ensuring clients only send and accept messages over authenticated
   TLS/DTLS connections.

   Attackers may attempt to modify messages exchanged by a client and a
   floor control server.  The integrity protection provided by TLS/DTLS
   connections prevents this attack.

   An attacker may attempt to fetch a valid message sent by a client to
   a floor control server and replay it over a connection between the
   attacker and the floor control server.  This attack is prevented by
   having floor control servers check that messages arriving over a
   given authenticated TLS/DTLS connection use an authorized user ID
   (i.e., a user ID that the user that established the authenticated
   TLS/DTLS connection is allowed to use).

   Attackers may attempt to pick messages from the network to get access
   to confidential information between the floor control server and a

   client (e.g., why a floor request was denied).  TLS/DTLS
   confidentiality prevents this attack.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED
   that TLS/DTLS be used with a non-null encryption algorithm.


15.  IANA Considerations

      [Editorial note: This section instructs the IANA to register new
      entries in the BFCP Primitive subregistry in Section 15.2 and for
      the BFCP Error Code subregistry in Section 15.4.]

   The IANA has created a registry for BFCP parameters called "Binary
   Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) Parameters".  This registry has a
   number of subregistries, which are described in the following
   sections.

15.1.  Attribute Subregistry

   This section establishes the Attribute subregistry under the BFCP
   Parameters registry.  As per the terminology in RFC 5226 [3], the
   registration policy for BFCP attributes shall be "Specification
   Required".  For the purposes of this subregistry, the BFCP attributes
   for which IANA registration is requested MUST be defined by a
   standards-track RFC.  Such an RFC MUST specify the attribute's type,
   name, format, and semantics.

   For each BFCP attribute, the IANA registers its type, its name, and
   the reference to the RFC where the attribute is defined.  The
   following table contains the initial values of this subregistry.

16.  Changes from RFC 4582

   Following is the list of technical changes and other non-trivial
   fixes from [15].

16.1.  Extensions for an unreliable transport

   Main purpose of this work was to revise the specification to support
   BFCP over an unreliable transport, resulting in the following
   changes:

   Overview of Operation  (Section 4):
         Changed the description of client-initiated and server-
         initiated transactions, referring to Section 8.

   COMMON-HEADER Format  (Section 5.1):
         Ver(sion) field, where the value 2 is used for the extensions
         for an unreliable transport.  Added new R and F flag-bits for
         an unreliable transport.  Res(erved) field is now 3 bit.  New
         optional Fragment Offset and Fragment Length fields.

Internet-Draft                    BFCP                        April 2013


   New primitives  (Section 5.1):
         Added four new primitives: FloorRequestStatusAck,
         FloorStatusAck, Goodbye, and GoodbyeAck.

   New error codes  (Section 5.2.6):
         Added three new error codes: "Unable to Parse Message", "Use
         DTLS" and "Unsupported Version".  Note that two additional
         error codes were added, see Section 16.2.

   ABNF for new primitives  (Section 5.3):
         New subsections with normative ABNF for the new primitives.

   Transport split in two  (Section 6):
         Section 6 specifying the transport was split in two
         subsections; Section 6.1 for a reliable transport and
         Section 6.2 for an unreliable transport.  Where the
         specification for an unreliable transport amongst other issues
         deals with reliability, congestion control, fragmentation and
         ICMP.

   Mandate DTLS  (Section 7 and Section 9):
         Mandate DTLS support when transport over UDP is used.

   Transaction changes  (Section 8):
         Server-initiated transactions over an unreliable transport has
         non-zero and unique Transaction ID.  Over an unreliable
         transport, the retransmit timers T1 and T2 described in
         Section 8.3 applies.

   Requiring timely response  (Section 10.1.2, Section 10.2.2,
         Section 11.2, Section 12.1.2, Section 12.2.2, Section 12.3.2,
         Section 12.4.2, Section 10.1.3 and Section 12.1.3):
         Describing that a given response must be sent within the
         transaction failure window to complete the transaction.

   Updated IANA Considerations  (Section 15):
         Added the new primitives and error codes to Section 15.2 and
         Section 15.4 respectively.

   Examples over an unreliable transport  (Appendix A):
         Added sample interactions over an unreliable transport for the
         scenarios in Figure 2 and Figure 3

   Motivation for an unreliable transport  (Appendix B):
         Introduction to and motivation for extending BFCP to support an
         unreliable transport.

16.2.  Other changes

   The clarification and bug fixes:

   ABNF fixes  (Figure 22, Figure 24, ="fig:reqby-information"/>,
      Figure 28, Figure 30, and the ABNF figures in Section 5.3):
      Although formally correct in [15], the notation has changed in a
      number of Figures to an equivalent form for clarity, e.g.,
      s/*1(FLOOR-ID)/[FLOOR-ID]/ in Figure 38 and s/*[XXX]/*(XXX)/ in
      the other figures.

   Typo  (Section 12.4.2):
      Change from SUPPORTED-PRIMITVIES to SUPPORTED-PRIMITIVES in the
      second paragraph.

   Corrected attribute type  (Section 13.1.1):
      Change from PARTICIPANT-PROVIDED-INFO to PRIORITY attributed in
      the eighth paragraph, since the note below describes priority and
      that the last paragraph deals with PARTICIPANT-PROVIDED-INFO.

   New error codes  (Section 5.2.6):
      Added two additional error codes: "Incorrect Message Length" and
      "Generic Error".

Appendix A.  Example Call Flows for BFCP over an Unreliable Transport

   With reference to Section 4.1, the following figures show
   representative call-flows for requesting and releasing a floor, and
   obtaining status information about a floor when BFCP is deployed over
   an unreliable transport.  The figures here show a loss-less
   interaction.

                Figure 48: Requesting and releasing a floor

   Note that in Figure 48, the FloorRequestStatus message from the floor
   control server to the floor participant is a transaction-closing
   message as a response to the client-initiated transaction with
   Transaction ID 154.  It does not and SHOULD NOT be followed by a
   FloorRequestStatusAck message from the floor participant to the floor

B.1.  Motivation

   In existing video conferencing deployments, BFCP is used to manage
   the floor for the content sharing associated with the conference.
   For peer to peer scenarios, including business to business
   conferences and point to point conferences in general, it is
   frequently the case that one or both endpoints exists behind a NAT.
   BFCP roles are negotiated in the offer/answer exchange as specified
   in [7], resulting in one endpoint being responsible for opening the
   TCP connection used for the BFCP communication.

                            Figure 50: Use Case

   The communication session between the video conferencing endpoints
   typically consists of a number of RTP over UDP media streams, for
   audio and video, and a BFCP connection for floor control.  Existing
   deployments are most common in, but not limited to, enterprise
   networks.  In existing deployments, NAT traversal for the RTP streams
   works using ICE and/or other methods, including those described in
   [29].

   When enhancing an existing SIP based video conferencing deployment
   with support for content sharing, the BFCP connection often poses a
   problem.  The reasons for this fall into two general classes.  First,
   there may be a strong preference for UDP based signaling in general.
   On high capacity endpoints (e.g., PSTN gateways or SIP/H.323 inter-
   working gateways), TCP can suffer from head of line blocking, and it
   uses many kernel buffers.  Network operators view UDP as a way to
   avoid both of these.  Second, establishment and traversal of the TCP
   connection involving ephemeral ports, as is typically the case with
   BFCP over TCP, can be problematic, as described in Appendix A of
   [27].  A broad study of NAT behavior and peer-to-peer TCP
   establishment for a comprehensive set of TCP NAT traversal techniques
   over a wide range of commercial NAT products concluded it was not
   possible to establish a TCP connection in 11% of the cases [30].  The
   results are worse when focusing on enterprise NATs.  A study of hole

   punching as a NAT traversal technique across a wide variety of
   deployed NATs reported consistently higher success rates when using
   UDP than when using TCP [31].

   It is worth noticing that BFCP over UDP were already used in real
   deployments, underlining the necessity to specify a common way to
   exchange BFCP messages where TCP is not appropriate, to avoid a
   situation where multiple different and non-interoperable would co-
   exist in the market.  The purpose of this draft is to formalize and
   publish the extension from the standard specification to facilitate
   complete interoperability between implementations.

B.1.1.  Alternatives Considered

   In selecting the approach of defining UDP as an alternate transport
   for BFCP, several alternatives were considered and explored to some
   degree.  Each of these is discussed briefly in the following
   subsections.  In summary, while the not chosen alternatives work in a
   number of scenarios, they are not sufficient, in and of themselves,
   to address the use case targeted by this draft.  The last
   alternative, presented in Appendix B.1.1.7, is the selected one and
   is specified in this draft.

   It is also worth noting that the IETF Transport Area were asked for a
   way to tunnel TCP over UDP, but at that point there was no consensus
   on how to achieve that.

B.1.1.1.  ICE TCP

   ICE TCP [27] extends ICE to TCP based media, including the ability to
   offer a mix of TCP and UDP based candidates for a single stream.  ICE
   TCP has, in general, a lower success probability for enabling TCP
   connectivity without a relay if both of the hosts are behind a NAT
   (see Appendix A of [27]) than enabling UDP connectivity in the same
   scenarios.  The happens because many of the currently deployed NATs
   in video conferencing networks do not support the flow of TCP hand
   shake packets seen in case of TCP simultaneous-open, either because
   they do not allow incoming TCP SYN packets from an address to which a
   SYN packet has been sent to recently, or because they do not properly
   process the subsequent SYNACK.  Implementing various techniques
   advocated for candidate collection in [27] should increase the
   success probability, but many of these techniques require support
   from some network elements (e.g., from the NATs).  Such support is
   not common in enterprise NATs.

B.1.1.2.  Teredo

   Teredo [23] enables nodes located behind one or more IPv4 NATs to
   obtain IPv6 connectivity by tunneling packets over UDP.  Teredo
   extensions [25] provide additional capabilities to Teredo, including
   support for more types of NATs and support for more efficient
   communication.

   As defined, Teredo could be used to make BFCP work for the video
   conferencing use cases addressed in this draft.  However, running the
   service requires the help of "Teredo servers" and "Teredo relays"
   [23].  These servers and relays generally do not exist in the
   existing video conferencing deployments.  It also requires IPv6
   awareness on the endpoints.  It should also be noted that ICMP6, as
   used with Teredo to complete an initial protocol exchange and confirm
   that the appropriate NAT bindings have been set up, is not a
   conventional feature of IPv4 or even IPv6, and some currently
   deployed IPv6 firewalls discard ICMP messages.  As these networks
   continue to evolve and tackle the transaction to IPv6, Teredo servers
   and relays may be deployed, making Teredo available as a suitable
   alternative to BFCP over UDP.

B.1.1.3.  GUT

   GUT [28] attempts to facilitate tunneling over UDP by encapsulating
   the native transport protocol and its payload (in general the whole
   IP payload) within a UDP packet destined to the well-known port
   GUT_P. Unfortunately, it requires user-space TCP, for which there is
   not a readily available implementation, and creating one is a large
   project in itself.  This draft has expired and its future is still
   not clear as it has not yet been adopted by a working group.

B.1.1.4.  UPnP IGD

   Universal Plug and Play Internet Gateway Devices (UPnP IGD) sit on
   the edge of the network, providing connectivity to the Internet for
   computers internal to the LAN, but do not allow Internet devices to
   connect to computers on the internal LAN.  IGDs enable a computer on
   an internal LAN to create port mappings on their NAT, through which
   hosts on the Internet can send data that will be forwarded to the
   computer on the internal LAN.  IGDs may be self-contained hardware
   devices or may be software components provided within an operating
   system.

   In considering UPnP IGD, several issues exist.  Not all NATs support
   UPnP, and many that do support it are configured with it turned off
   by default.  NATs are often multilayered, and UPnP does not work well
   with such NATs.  For example, a typical DSL modems acts as a NAT, and

   the user plugs in a wireless access point behind that, which adds
   another layer NAT.  The client can discover the first layer of NAT
   using multicast but it is harder to figure out how to discover and
   control NATs in the next layer up.

B.1.1.5.  NAT PMP

   The NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT PMP) allows a computer in a
   private network (behind a NAT router) to automatically configure the
   router to allow parties outside the private network to contact it.
   NAT PMP runs over UDP.  It essentially automates the process of port
   forwarding.  Included in the protocol is a method for retrieving the
   public IP address of a NAT gateway, thus allowing a client to make
   this public IP address and port number known to peers that may wish
   to communicate with it.

   Many NATs do not support PMP.  In those that do support it, it has
   similar issues with negotiation of multilayer NATs as UPnP.  Video
   conferencing is used extensively in enterprise networks, and NAT PMP
   is not generally available in enterprise-class routers.

B.1.1.6.  SCTP

   It would be quite straight forward to specify a BFCP binding for SCTP
   [26], and then tunnel SCTP over UDP in the use case described in
   Appendix B.1.  SCTP is gaining some momentum currently.  There is
   ongoing discussion in the RTCWeb WG regarding this approach.
   However, this approach for tunneling over UDP was not mature enough
   when considered and not even fully specified.

B.1.1.7.  BFCP over UDP transport

   To overcome the problems with establishing TCP flows between BFCP
   entities, an alternative is to define UDP as an alternate transport
   for BFCP, leveraging the same mechanisms in place for the RTP over
   UDP media streams for the BFCP communication.  When using UDP as the
   transport, it is recommended to follow the guidelines provided in
   [24].

   Minor changes to the transaction model are introduced in that all
   requests now have an appropriate response to complete the
   transaction.  The requests are sent with a retransmit timer
   associated with the response to achieve reliability.  This
   alternative does not change the semantics of BFCP.  It permits UDP as
   an alternate transport.

   Existing implementations, in the spirit of the approach detailed in
   earlier versions of this draft, have demonstrated this approach to be

   feasible.  Initial compatibility among implementations has been
   achieved at previous interoperability events.  The authors view this
   extension as a pragmatic solution to an existing deployment
   challenge.  This is the chosen approach, and the extensions is
   specified in this document.
