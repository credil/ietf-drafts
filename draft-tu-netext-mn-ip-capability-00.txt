               MN IP Capability for Wifi-EPC Integration
                  draft-tu-netext-mn-ip-capability-00

Abstract

   WiFi is beginning to be considered as a trusted non-3GPP access
   network which can provide the service of accessing to the EPC core
   network to the user.  And EAP/AKA(and EAP/AKA') is specified as the
   access authentication protocol in this case.  This document defines a
   new EAP attribute to provide the mobile node IPv4/IPv6/IPv4v6
   capability to the network so that mobile node IP address/prefix
   assignment and PMIP session establishment can be processed
   accordingly.

Internet-Draft  MN IP Capability for Wifi-EPC Integration  December 2012


1.  Introduction

   The 3GPP networks support multiple PDN connections, and the PDN type
   of these connections can be IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6.  When the mobile
   node attaches to the 3GPP networks or requests to establish a new PDN
   connection, it will request for a specific PDN type based on its IP
   stack configuration, and the MME compares the requested PDN type to
   the PDN type in the subscription records stored in the HSS and sets
   the PDN type accordingly.  For a specific PDN connection, the MN IP
   address/prefix assignment and session establishment should be based
   on this final PDN type.  When the mobile node accesses to the 3GPP
   network by WiFi which works as a trusted non-3GPP access technology,
   the final PDN type also should be set according to the PDN type of
   Mobile node requested and stored in the subscription records.
   However, these is no existing way for the mobile node to carry PDN
   type or MN IP stack capability information to the Wifi access
   network.

   This document defines a new EAP attribute, the MN IP Capability, that
   can be used by the mobile node for carrying information to the wifi
   access network about the MN IP capability, which can be used for IP
   address/prefix assignment and session(e.g.  PMIP or GTP)
   establishment.

3.  MN IP Capability for Wifi-EPC Integration

3.1.  Overview

   EAP AKA(and EAP AKA') is always used as the access authentication
   protocol in the case of WiFi-EPC integration.  The information
   carried in the payload of EAP protocol between the mobile node and
   network elements, such as HO indication or APN, can be used to
   trigger the PMIP or GTP session establishment.

   Mobile node IP capability has very tight relationship with the type
   of PMIP or GTP session that the MN requests to establish.If the MN IP
   capability is IPv4 or IPv6, then the mobile node only allow to
   request for a IPv4 or IPv6 PMIP/GTP session establishment even if the
   PDN type in the subscription records is IPv4v6, and only IPv4 address
   or IPv6 prefix can be assigned to the mobile node.  And if the MN IP

   capability is IPv4v6, the mobile node shall request for a IPv4v6
   PMIP/GTP session establishment, then if the PDN type in the
   subscription records is allowed to be IPv4v6, both IPv4 address and
   IPv6 prefix can be assigned to this mobile node when the IPv4v6 type
   PMIP/GTP session is established.

   This draft makes use of the EAP Authentication procedure to carry the
   MN IP capability from the mobile node to the network elements, which
   can be used for IP address/prefix assignment and session(e.g.  PMIP
   or GTP) establishment.

3.2.  Attribute Extensions

3.2.1.  AT_IP_CAPABILITY

   A new EAP attribute, called AT_IP_CAPABILITY, is defined to be
   included in any of the EAP Request messages that are integrity
   protected, such as the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge.  This attribute is
   used for conveying the mobile node's IP stack capability information.
   Its format is the following:



     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |   AT_IP       | Length        | MN IP Capability              |
     |  _CAPABILITY  |               |                               |
