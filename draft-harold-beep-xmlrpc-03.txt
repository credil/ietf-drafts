XML-RPC is an Extensible Markup Language-Remote Procedure Calling
protocol that works over the Internet.  It defines an XML format for
messages that are transfered between clients and servers using HTTP.
An XML-RPC message encodes either a procedure to be invoked by the
server, along with the parameters to use in the invocation, or the
result of an invocation.  Procedure parameters and results can be
scalars, numbers, strings, dates, etc.; they can also be complex
record and list structures.

This document specifies a how to use the Blocks Extensible Exchange
Protocol (BEEP) to transfer messages encoded in the XML-RPC format
between clients and servers.

This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Discussion and
