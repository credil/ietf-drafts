            Resolution of The SPF and Sender ID Experiments
                    draft-ietf-spfbis-experiment-07

Abstract

   In 2006 the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising
   SPF and Sender ID, two proposed email authentication protocols.
   Because of possible interoperability issues, particularly but not
   only those created by simultaneous use of the two protocols by a
   receiver, the IESG was unable to determine technical consensus and
   decided it was best to publish all of RFC4405, RFC4406, RFC4407 and
   RFC4408 as Experimental documents.  The IESG invited the community to
   observe their deployments for a period of time, and expressed hope
   for later convergence of opinion.

   After six years, sufficient experience and evidence have been
   collected that the experiments thus created can be considered
   concluded.  This document presents those findings.

Internet-Draft          SPF/Sender ID Experiments             April 2012


1.  Introduction

   In April 2006, the IETF published the [SPF] and Sender ID email
   authentication protocols, the latter consisting of three documents
   ([SUBMITTER], [SENDER-ID], and [PRA]).  Both of these protocols
   enable one to publish via the Domain Name System a policy declaring
   which mail servers were authorized to send email on behalf of a
   specific domain name.  The two protocols made use of this same policy
   statement and some specific (but different) logic to evaluate whether
   the email client sending or relaying a message was authorized to do
   so.

   Consensus did not clearly support one protocol over the other, and
   there was significant concern that the two would conflict in some
   significant operational situations, interfering with message
   delivery.  The IESG required the publication of all of these
   documents as Experimental, and requested that the community observe
   deployment and operation of the protocols over a period of two years
   from the date of publication in order to determine a reasonable path
   forward.

   In line with the IESG's request to evaluate after a period of time,
   this document concludes the experiments by presenting evidence
   regarding both deployment and comparative effect of the two
   protocols.  At the end it presents conclusions based on the data
   collected.

   It is important to note that this document makes no direct technical
   comparison of the two protocols in terms of correctness, weaknesses,
   or use case coverage.  The email community at large has already done
   that through its deployment choices.  Rather, the analysis presented
   here merely observes what has been deployed and supported in the time
   since the protocols were published, and draws conclusions based on
   those observations.

   The data collected and presented here are presumed to be a reasonable
   representative view of the global deployment data, which could never
   itself be fully surveyed within a reasonable period of time.


2.  Definitions

   The term "RRTYPE" is used to refer to a Domain Name System ([DNS])
   Resource Record (RR) type.  These are always expressed internally in
   software as numbers, assigned by IANA under Expert Review provisions.
   Assigned RRTYPEs also have names.  The two of interest in this work
   are the TXT RRTYPE (16) and the SPF RRTYPE (99).

3.  Evidence of Deployment

   This section presents the collected research done to determine what
   parts of the two protocol suites are in general use, as well as
   related issues like [DNS] support.

3.1.  DNS Resource Record Types

   Two large-scale DNS surveys were run that looked for the two
   supported kinds of RRTYPEs that can contain SPF policy statements.
   Specifically, these surveys pulled a large number of domain names
   from recent activity logs and queried their nameservers for both
   RRTYPEs that can be used for SPF and/or Sender ID.  In the tables
   below, only syntactically valid replies are counted.

   DNS Survey #1

     +------------------+-----------+-------+
     | Domains queried  | 1,000,000 |   -   |
     | TXT replies      |   397,511 | 39.8% |
     | SPF replies      |     6,627 | <0.1% |
     | SPF+TXT replies  |     6,603 | <0.1% |
     | spf2.0/* replies |     5,291 | <0.1% |
     +------------------+-----------+-------+

   The "spf2.0/*" replies are those replies whose payload started with
   the string "spf2.0/", which are specific requests for Sender ID
   processing.

   DNS Survey #2

     +------------------+-----------+-------+
     | Domains queried  |   259,918 |   -   |
     | TXT replies      |   142,640 | 54.9% |
     | SPF replies      |     2,727 |  1.0% |
     | SPF+TXT replies  |     2,554 | <0.1% |
     | spf2.0/* replies |     6,972 |  2.7% |
     +------------------+-----------+-------+

   During this second survey, some domains were observed to provide
   immediate answers for RRTYPE 16 queries, but would time out waiting
   for replies to RRTYPE 99 queries.  For example, it was observed that
   4,179 (over 1.6%) distinct domains in the survey returned a result of
   some kind (a record or an error) for the TXT query in time N, while
   the SPF query ultimately failed after at least time 4N.

Internet-Draft          SPF/Sender ID Experiments             April 2012


   DNS Survey #3

     +------------------+-----------+-------+
     | Domains queried  |   100,000 |   -   |
     | TXT replies      |    46,221 | 46.2% |
     | SPF replies      |       954 | <0.1% |
     | SPF+TXT replies  |     1,383 |  1.4% |
     +------------------+-----------+-------+

   A survey was done of queries for RRTYPE 16 and RRTYPE 99 records by
   observing nameserver logs.  Only a few queries were ever received for
   RRTYPE 99 records, and those almost exclusively came from one large
   email service provider that queried for both RRTYPEs.  The vast
   majority of other querying agents only ever requested RRTYPE 16.

3.2.  Implementations

   It is likely impossible to determine from a survey which Mail
   Transfer Agents (MTAs) have SPF and/or Sender ID checking enabled at
   message ingress since it does not appear, for example, in the reply
   to the EHLO command from extended [SMTP].  We therefore rely on
   evidence found via web searches, and observed the following:

   o  A web site [SID-IMPL] dedicated to highlighting Sender ID
      implementations last updated in late 2007 listed 13 commercial
      implementations, which we assume means they implement the PRA
      checks.  At least one of them is known no longer to be supported
      by its vendor.  There were no free open source implementations
      listed.

   o  The [OPENSPF] web site maintains a list of implementations of SPF.
      At the time of this document's writing it listed six libraries, 22
      MTAs with built-in SPF implementations, and numerous patches for
      MTAs and mail clients.  The set included a mix of commercial and
      free open source implementations.

3.3.  The SUBMITTER SMTP Extension

   In a review of numerous MTAs in current or recent use, two
   (Santronics WinServer and McAfee MxLogic) were found to contain
   implementations of the SMTP SUBMITTER extension as part of the MTA
   service, which could act as an enabler to Sender ID.

   An unknown number of SMTP clients implement SUBMITTER.  Although
   there is substantial activity showing its use in MTA logs, it is not
   possible to determine whether they are multiple instances of the same
   client, or separate client implementations.

Internet-Draft          SPF/Sender ID Experiments             April 2012


   An active survey was done of a approximately 160,000 running and
   publicly reachable MTAs.  Fewer than 4.5% of these advertised the
   SUBMITTER extension.  Based on the SMTP banner presented upon
   connection, the entire set of SUBMITTER-enabled MTAs consisted of the
   two found during the review (above) and a third whose identity could
   not be positively determined.

   Over 97% of the responding MTAs advertising the SUBMITTER SMTP
   extension were different instances of one MTA.  The service operating
   that MTA reported that about 11% of all observed SMTP sessions
   involved SMTP clients which make use of the SUBMITTER extension.


4.  Evidence of Differences

   Separate surveys compared the cases where the PRA (used by Sender ID)
   and the RFC5321.MailFrom address (used by SPF) differed.  The results
   of these tests showed that at least 50% of the time the two addresses
   were the same, but beyond that the percentage varied substantially
   from one sampling location to the next due to the nature of the mail
   streams they each receive.

   Despite this, one working group contributor analyzed approximately
   150,000 messages and found that in more than 95% of those cases,
   Sender ID and SPF reach the same conclusion about a message, meaning
   either both protocols return a "pass" result or both return a "fail"
   result.  The data set yielding this response could not further
   characterize the cases in which the answers differed.

   A second analysis of the same nature by a much larger mailbox
   provider found that the two protocols yielded the same result
   approximately 80% of the time when evaluated across billions of
   messages.


5.  Analysis

   Given the six years that have passed since the publication of the
   Experimental RFCs, and the evidence reported in the earlier sections
   of this document, the following analysis appears to be supported:

   1.  There has not been substantial adoption of the RRTYPE 99 (SPF)
       DNS resource record.  In all large-scale surveys performed for
       this work, less than 2% of responding domains published RRTYPE 99
       records, and almost no clients requested them.

   2.  Of the records retrieved, fewer than 3% included specific
       requests for processing of messages using the PRA algorithm,

Internet-Draft          SPF/Sender ID Experiments             April 2012


       which is an essential part of Sender ID.

   3.  Although the two mechanisms often used different email address
       fields as the subject being evaluated, no data collected showed
       any substantial operational benefit, in terms of improved
       accuracy, to using one mechanism over the other.

   4.  A review of known implementations shows significant support for
       both protocols, though there were more implementations in support
       of SPF than of Sender ID.  Further, the SPF implementations
       showed better upkeep and current interest than the Sender ID
       implemenations.

   5.  A survey of running MTAs shows fewer than 5% of them advertised
       the SUBMITTER extension, which is a Sender ID enabler.  Only
       three implementations of it were found.

   6.  Although they may be marginal, there remain obstacles to
       deployment of protocols that use DNS RRTYPEs other than the most
       common ones, including firewalls and DNS servers that block or
       discard requests for unknown RRTYPEs.  Further, few if any web-
       based DNS configuration tools offer support for RRTYPE 99
       records.


6.  Conclusions

   In light of the analysis in the previous section, the following
   conclusions are supported:

   1.  The experiments comprising the series of RFCs defining the
       SUBMITTER SMTP extension (RFC4405), the Sender ID mechanism
       (RFC4406), the Purported Responsible address algorithm (RFC4407),
       and SPF (RFC4408), should be considered concluded.

   2.  The absence of significant adoption of the RRTYPE 99 DNS Resource
       Record suggests that it has not attracted enough support to be
       useful.

   3.  The absence of significant adoption of the [SUBMITTER] extension,
       [SENDER-ID], and [PRA], indicates that there is not a strong
       community deploying and using these protocols.

   4.  [SPF] has widespread implementation and deployment, comparable to
       that of many standards track protocols.

   Appendix A is offered as a cautionary review of problems that
   affected the process of developing SPF and Sender ID in terms of

   their use of the DNS.

Appendix A.  Background on the RRTYPE Issue

   SPF was originally developed by a community of interested developers
   outside the IETF, with the intent of bringing it to the IETF for
   standardization after it had become relatively mature and ready for
   the IETF standards track process.

   At the time of SPF's initial development, the prospect of getting an
   RRTYPE allocated for SPF was not seriously considered, partly because
   doing so had high barriers to entry.  As a result, at the time it was
   brought to the IETF for development and publication, there was
   already a substantial and growing installed base that had SPF running
   using TXT RRs.  Eventually the application was made for the new
   RRTYPE as a result of pressure from the DNS experts in the community,
   who insisted upon doing so as the preferred path toward using the DNS
   for storing such things as policy data.

   Later, after RRTYPE 99 was assigned (long after IESG approval of the
   document, in fact), a plan was put into place to effect a gradual
   transition to using RRTYPE 99 instead of using RRTYPE 16.  This plan
   failed to take effect for four primary reasons:

   1.  there was hesitation to make the transition because existing
       nameservers (and, in fact, DNS-aware firewalls) would drop or
       reject requests for unknown RRTYPEs (see Section 3 for evidence
       of this), which means successful rollout of a new RRtype is
       contingent upon widespread adoption of updated nameservers and
       resolver functions;

   2.  many DNS provisioning tools (e.g., web interfaces to controlling
       DNS zone data) were, and still are, typically lethargic about
       adding support for new RRTYPEs;

   3.  the substantial deployed base was already using RRTYPE 16, and it
       was working just fine, leading to inertia;

   4.  [SPF] itself included a faulty transition plan, likely because of
       the late addition of a requirement to develop one: It said a
       server SHOULD publish both RRTYPEs and MUST publish at least one,



Kucherawy               Expires October 26, 2012                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          SPF/Sender ID Experiments             April 2012


       while a client can query either or both, which means both can
       claim to be fully compliant while failing utterly to
       interoperate.  Publication occurred without proper IETF review,
       so this was not detected prior to publication.

   It is likely that this will happen again if the bar to creating new
   RRTYPEs even for experimental development purposes is not lowered,
   and handling of unknown RRTYPEs in software becomes generally more
   graceful.  Also important in this regard is encouragement of support
   for new RRTYPEs in DNS record provisioning tools.

   Fortunately in the intervening time, the requirements for new RRTYPE
   assignments was changed to Expert Review, and the posture has become
   more relaxed.  Also, the publication of [DNS-EXPAND] has provided
   some useful guidance in this regard.  However, there is still a
   common perception that adding new types of data to the DNS will face
   resistance due to the lack of appropriate software support.

   There are DNS experts within the community that will undoubtedly
   point to DNS servers and firewalls that mistreat queries for unknown
   RRTYPEs, and to overly simplistic provisioning tools, and claim they
   are broken as a way of answering these concerns.  This is undoubtedly
   correct, but the reality is that they are among us and likely will be
   for some time, and this needs to be considered as new protocols and
   IETF procedures are developed.
