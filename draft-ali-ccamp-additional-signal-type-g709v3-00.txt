     Abstract 

     [I-D.draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3] provides the 
     extensions to the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching 
     (GMPLS) signaling to control the full set of OTN features including 
     ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex. However, it does not cover 
     additional signal types mentioned in [G.Sup43] (ODU1e, ODU3e1, 
     ODU3e2) or (ODU1f, ODU2f). This draft provides GMPLS signaling 
     extension for these additional signal types.

     1. Introduction 

        [I-D.draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3] updates the ODU-
        related portions of [RFC4328] to provide Resource ReserVation 
        Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions to support 
        control for [G.709-v3]. However, it does not cover additional 
        signal types mentioned in [G.Sup43] (ODU1e, ODU3e1, ODU3e2) or 
        (ODU1f and ODU2f).  

        With the evolution and deployment of Optical Transport Network 
        (OTN) technology, it is necessary to support additional signal 
        types mentioned in [G.Sup43] and (ODU1f and ODU2f). [I-D.draft-
        khuzema-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709] had support for signal types 
        mentioned in [G.Sup43] but the signal types values collides with 
        values defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3]. 
        The draft has expired and also does not support ODU1f and ODU2f 
        signal type.

     Internet-Draft draft-ali-ccamp-additional-signal-type-g709v3-00.txt 
      
        This draft provides GMPLS signaling extension to support 
        additional signal types mentioned in [G.Sup43] and (ODU1f and 
        ODU2f). 

     2. RSVP-TE extension for Additional Signal Types 

        [I-D.draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3] defines the format 
        of Traffic Parameters in OTN-TDM SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-TDM 
        FLOWSPEC objects. The said traffic parameters have a signal type 
        field. This document defines the signal type for ODU1e, ODU3e1, 
        ODU3e2, ODU1f and ODU2f, as follows:  

                     Value     Type 
                     -----     ---- 
                       23      ODU1e  (10Gbps Ethernet [GSUP.43]) 
                       24      ODU1f  (10Gbps Fiber Channel) 
                       25      ODU2f  (10Gbps Fiber Channel) 
                       26      ODU3e1 (40Gbps Ethernet [GSUP.43]) 
                       27      ODU3e2 (40Gbps Ethernet [GSUP.43]) 
         
     3. Security Considerations 

        This document does not introduce any additional security issues 
        above those identified in [I-D.draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-
        g709v3].  

     4. IANA Considerations  

        This document defines signal type for ODU1e, ODU3e1, ODU3e2, 
        ODU1f and ODU2f to be carried in Traffic Parameters in OTN-TDM 
        SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC objects [I-D. draft-ietf-
        ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3].
