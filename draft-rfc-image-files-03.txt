Abstract

   Documents in the RFC series normally use only plain-text ASCII
   characters and a fixed-width font.  However, there is sometimes a
   need to supplement the ASCII text with images -- e.g., graphics,
   equations, or pictures.  The historic solution to this requirement
   has allowed secondary PDF and/or Postscript files, but this approach
   has seldom been used because it is awkward for authors and publisher.
   This memo sugests a convenient scheme for logically including
   authoritative diagrams, illustrations, equations, or other graphics
   within RFCs.

1.  Introduction

   Published documents in the RFC series normally use only plain-text
   ASCII characters and a fixed-width font [RFC2223].  This simple
   convention has the advantage of a stable encoding for which a great
   variety of tools are readily available for viewing, searching,
   editing, etc.

   Inclusion of diagrams, state machines, complex equations, and other
   graphics in RFC text has generally relied on the imaginative use of
   ASCII characters ("ASCII artwork").  However, in a few cases over the
   years, ASCII artwork has been inadequate for images needed or desired
   in RFCs.  The solution to this dilemma has been to allow multiple
   versions of an RFC: a primary ASCII version as well as secondary
   versions that are encoded using PDF and Postcript.  The PDF and
   Postscript versions are "complete", containing a copy of the text as
   well as the full images [RFC2223].  The textual content and layout of
   the PDF/PS version is required to match the base version as closely
   as possible.  However, except in a few rare exception cases (see,
   e.g., [RFC1129]) the ASCII text version is considered the official
   expression of the RFC, and it is always normative for standards-track
   documents.  We will refer to this scheme as "txt/ps/pdf"
   representation.

   The three versions of an RFC using the txt/ps/pdf representation are
   in separate files in the primary RFC repository
   (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/), with suffixes ".txt", ".pdf", and
   ".ps".  The RFC Editor search engine returns links to all three
   versions when they are present in the repository.

   Unfortunately, the txt/ps/pdf approach has been awkward for both
   editor and author, and it is error-prone.  Therefore, it has seldom
   been used (roughly 50 out of 5000+ RFCs).  The problem is that, in
   general, only the author has the tools to edit the PDF and Postscript
   versions.  The RFC Editor can readily edit only the primary ASCII
   text, and then the author must incorporate the resulting changes into
   the PDF/PS version while maintaining the "look" of the RFC to the
   extent possible.  There is no practical way for the RFC Editor to
   verify that this is done correctly, which may lead to editorial
   errors, reader confusion.  It may also lengthen publication time.

   This memo suggests a much better scheme for including figures,
   illustrations, and graphics to an RFC.  We hope that the method
   proposed here will solve the image problem for RFC publication, while
   preserving the convenience, stability, and searchability of ASCII
   base documents.  The txt/ps/pdf approach would still be possible (and
   in any case, RFCs using the historic scheme will continue to exist in
   the RFC repository forever).

   mailing list.  For subscription information and archives, see

2.  A New Scheme for Images: Composite RFCs

   Under the suggested scheme, an RFC would be either a single ASCII
   file as generally used today, or a composite of two files: an ASCII-
   only "base file" containing the text of the RFC, and an "image file".
   When present, the image file would be a PDF file that contained only
   images, captions, and title information.  Neither file of the
   composite would be complete without the other, and a reference to the
   RFC would be considered a reference to both files.  An RFC would then
   be a logical entity whose complete representation could require two
   files, base and image.

   The base file would be formatted exactly like current ASCII RFCs,
   with minor exceptions described below.  An image file would contain
   one or more items that will be known collectively as "figures",
   whether they are actually diagrams, pictures, tables, equations,
   artwork, or other non-textual constructions.

   If the approach of this document is adopted, terms like "the RFC"
   will refer to the combination of the base RFC file and an image file
   if the latter is supplied.  Note that, just as with the txt/ps/pdf
   representations, an RFC is a logical entity whose complete
   representation requires multiple files.  In particular, the IPR
   statement in the base file ("Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF
   Trust in Contributions BCP 78, RFC 5378 [RFC5378]) would apply to the
   composite, including the image file if one is present.

   An ASCII RFC traditionally uses a file name in the form of
   "rfcN.txt", where N is integer RFC number without leading zeros.  The
   image file that is associated with RFC number N could be named
   "rfcN.img.pdf".  As noted earlier, the repository contains RFCs with
   file names "rfcN.ps" and "rfcN.pdf", using the historic txt/ps/pdf
   representations.

   This "image file" scheme was inspired by a tradition of book
   publishing, in which pictures, figures, or "plates" may be grouped
   together following the text ("end figures"), or even bound separately
   from the main body of the text.

   In principle, we could allow an image file to be encoded using both
   PDF and Postscript, since mechanical translation is possible in both
   directions.  However, in the 20 years since the adoption of the txt/
   ps/pdf representations, the PDF format has become a de facto standard

   for electronic documents, and readers for it are universally
   available.  Furthermore, PDF has been standardized as a format for
   document archiving, as discussed further in the next section.
   Therefore, we propose to allow only PDF for image files, simplifying
   the new approach by not including a Postscript file option.


3.  Construction of an Image File

   An image file would be a single PDF file, consistent with the
   description in [RFC3778] and defined in [ISO32000-1].  The particular
   PDF form must be version-stable and must not contain any external
   references in scripts or otherwise.  Those requirements are satisfied
   by the PDF/A [ISO19005-1] [ISO19005-2] profile.  The RFC Editor may
   authorize other variants of PDF in the future.

   There is an issue of whether particular PDF generators PDF that claim
   to satisfy PDF/A actually do so.  Future experience may require
   published guidelines on PDF-generating software that claims to
   satisfy PDF/A but does not.

   Except as otherwise specified in this document, an image file should
   contain only figures, supporting labels and captions, headers, and
   footers.  It should not contain explanatory text or other materials
   that could reasonably be expressed in plain-text form in the base
   file.  In particular, required sections of RFCs, such as IANA
   Considerations or references, must be completely understandable from
   the base text file.  Any figures referenced from those sections may
   contain only supplemental material.

   The image file would be paginated using the same 8.5 x 11" format as
   the base document, and the image file pages would be consecutively
   numbered.  The first page number of the image file would follow the
   last page number of the base RFC.  Each page of the image file would
   contain the same headers and footers as the base file, except for one
   change in the footer, suggested below.  Since editing the base file
   may change its pagination, it may be simplest to ask the RFC Editor
   to overlay the headers and footers onto the image file near the
   completion of editing.  Each page would need blank space at the top
   and bottom for this purpose.  The amount of blank space is to be
   determined, but 0.5" might be a reasonable value.

   Figures included in the image file would have to be labeled in a
   fashion that facilitated referencing from the base RFC.  The labels
   should normally be numeric and monotonic.  Simple consecutive
   integers will usually be the best choice, but in some cases it might
   be desirable to use a hierarchical scheme like: <section #>.<fig #>.
   An author who believes that another labeling scheme would increase

   clarity should consult the RFC Editor.


4.  Requirements for the Base File

4.1.  Overview

   A base file would be unchanged by the presence of an image file,
   except for the following.

   o  The page number of the end-of-RFC boilerplate page would be
      changed to be logically one page after the last image file page.

   o  A new unnumbered "Figures" section would be required.  This is
      described below.

   o  For a composite RFC, a minor modification to the first-page header
      of the base file and to the footers of both base and image files
      would tie the two files together.  This is described below.

4.2.  Figures Section

   An RFC that used this scheme (and had any figures) would need to
   include a Figures section in the ASCII base file.  The Figures
   section should immediately follow the Table of Contents, if any, and
   precede the body of the document.  The Figures section should list
   all figures in tabular form, indicating for each one the figure
   identification, title, and page number(s).

   The style for the Figures section has not yet been fully specified.
   Here is a suggested example.

___________________________________________________________________________

   An RFC that includes a base file may include ASCII artwork that is
   suggestive of a figure in the image file, but there is no requirement
   to do so.  When such an approximate figure appears as ASCII artwork
   in the base file, its figure identification and caption must match
   those of the corresponding figure in the image file, and the entry in
   the Figures table should specify the page numbers in both the base
   and image file.  In the example shown above, image file page numbers
   are marked with an asterisk.  Note that very simple ASCII artwork
   need not have corresponding material in the image file.

   Groups of mathematical equations form one particular case in which it
   may be desirable for a base file to include ASCII artwork
   approximations.  This will ease searching for such documents using
   equation terminology. equations.  There are well-established
   conventions for approximating fairly complex equations using ASCII
   artwork.

4.3.  Formatting Changes

   It would be necessary to tie the base and image files together, to
   make clear they are part of one RFC.  Here is an initial suggestion
   for formatting.



Braden & Klensin       Expires September 13, 2012               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               Images in RFCs                   March 2012


      The header line "Request for Comments: nnnn" in the base file
      could be changed to "Request for Comments: nnnn/Base".  For
      consistency, the lefthand footer could become "RFC nnnn/Base".
      The lefthand footer in the image file could then be: "RFC nnnn/
      Image".

      The following sentence could be placed in the "Status of this
      Memo" section: "This RFC is a composite of this base file and PDF
      image file <image file URL>."


5.  Submission and Processing of the Image File

   If an image file is needed, it should be submitted as an .img.pdf
   file along with the ASCII text file.

   The image file could be submitted without headers or footers.  The
   RFC Editor could then overlay the image file with the appropriate
   headers and footers, with correct pagination.  The RFC Editor would
   do no editing of the image file beyond adding headers and paginated
   footers.  If editing the base file revealed problems with figures in
   the image file, the authors would be asked to create a new image
   file.


6.  Bundled Composites

   The base/image file split should be very convenient for the process
   of editing and publishing RFCs, and all tools that return RFC meta-
   data should alert the reader to the composite structure.  However,
   users may sometimes prefer to obtain an existing composite RFC as a
   single file in a bundled format.

   Our suggestion for such bundling is to again use PDF encoding.  Thus,
   corresponding to the composite file pair (rfcN.txt, rfcN.img.pdf),
   there would be a new file with a name like "rfcN.bun.pdf".  The
   .bun.pdf file would be a single PDF file containing a facsimile of
   the .txt file (like the current .txt.pdf files) followed by the image
   file.

   It is important to understand what is being suggested here.  The
   .bun.pdf files would never be submitted for publication by authors;
   instead, the RFC Editor would mechanically generate the .bun.pdf
   files upon publication of the .txt and .img.pdf files (just as
   .txt.pdf files are now generated automatically).  Some users might
   choose to consider the bundled .bun.pdf file as "the RFC", but the
   RFC Editor would consider "the RFC" to be the {.txt, .img.pdf) file
   pair.  We note that:

Internet-Draft               Images in RFCs                   March 2012


      The composite is logically a single RFC that can be normative for
      a standards-track document.

      The .bun.pdf bundle, whch would be mechanically derived from the
      composite pair, might reasonably be declared in the future to be
      equally normative.

      The continued existence of a base file that is readily editable by
      the RFC Editor and readily searchable by users would maintain the
      advantages of the present ASCII-based scheme.  We are not
      suggesting that, at least in the near term, the composite
      structure with its ASCII text component be abandoned.

      On the other hand, the .bun.pdf bundle could be a transitional
      step towards a future world where RFCs are published in pure .pdf.


7.  Implementation Considerations

   Implementation of the image file scheme has a number of implications.

   1.  The Internet Draft repository must allow submission and retrieval
       of both base and (when present) image files.

   2.  Internet Draft file names could be draft-...-vv.txt and
       (optionally) draft-...-vv.img.pdf, where "vv" is the normal
       version number.  Updating either file of the composite RFC should
       increase the version numbers "vv" in both files.  We DO NOT want
       two separate version numbers for one I-D.

   3.  The RFC Editor would need to be able to overlay headers, footers,
       and page numbers on a given image file.  It is claimed that at
       least Adobe Acrobat Professional includes this capability, and
       that it also has limited editing capability.

   4.  The RFC Editor would also need a tool to verify that a given
       image file satisfies the constraints of PDF/A and that the
       original image can be overlaid with headers and footers.

   5.  Some RFC Editor scripts and tools would need extensions.

   6.  Small extensions to xml2rfc [RFC2629] would be useful to create
       base/image file cross-references in header and footers, and to
       build a Figure section.

8.  RFC Repository File Formats

   A frequent reaction to the suggestion given in this memo is some
   confusion over the different file formats that appear in the RFC
   repository.  Here is a brief summary.

   If a PDF image file exists along with a base ASCII RFC, then RFCs in
   any format other than that combination (e.g., complete PDF files,
   HTML, or Postscript) remain supplemental, with the reader taking
   responsibility for assuring that they are equivalent to the base RFC
   and image file.  That arrangement is identical to the relationship
   between traditional all-ASCII RFCs and supplemental forms: the RFC
   Editor has never taken responsibility for guaranteeing that the two
   are identical in content.

   The existing .txt.pdf files are not affected by this proposal, nor
   are any of the traditional non-ASCII formats.  The .txt.pdf files are
   facsimiles of .txt (base files) in PDF, introduced to help Windows
   users read RFCs online.  However, Microsoft has more recently
   provided an elementary ASCII editor, which probably makes the
   .txt.pdf files unnecessary in any case.

   In summary:

   o  rfcN.txt: ASCII-only file.  In the traditional system, complete
      normative file.  In the new system, text (base) part of normative
      composite RFC, or stand-alone normative text file when no image
      file is necessary.

   o  rfcN.ps: Traditional system -- a Postscript file that includes
      figures and whose text is intended to be the same as the normative
      .txt file, but is generally non-normative itself.  No new rfcN.ps
      files would be created after adoption of the image file proposal.

   o  rfcN.pdf: Traditional system -- a PDF file that includes figures
      and whose text is intended to be the same as the normative .txt
      file, but is generally non-nformative itself.

   o  rfcN.txt.pdf: Traditional system: Facsimile of corresponding .txt
      file.

   o  rfcN.img.pdf: New system: image file component of a composite RFC.

   o  rfcN.bun.pdf: New system: bundled composite file.

9.  Internationalization Considerations

   Our scheme of image files does not, and is not intended to, support
   character set internationalization for RFCs.  It does not allow an
   author to omit the ASCII text from the base file and instead include
   the entire RFC text as one (very large) image file.

   However, we should note two examples that illustrate special cases.

   1.  RFC 3743 [RFC3743] on internationalized domain names for Chinese,
       Japanese, and Korean contains a number of examples that may be
       hard to follow because they can represent those characters only
       in "U+nnnn" form.  An image file could be used that would show
       the alternative Chinese characters for the examples.  This would
       not diminish either the ability to search the base text or index
       the document or its readability for those of us for whom reading
       Chinese characters is difficult, but it should help those who can
       read them.

   2.  Suppose that a proposed RFC contained a section derived from
       Japanese text.  The author might put an English translation into
       that section of the base document, note that the original was
       really in Japanese, and attach the Japanese as an appendix in an
       image file.  This should raise no difficulties for informative
       documents.  For normative documents, however, the existence of
       the Japanese original would raise some issues about what was
       actually authoritative, which is very undesirable.

   [Note in Draft: A separate proposal [Hoffman-RFC-UTF8] is under
   consideration to permit UTF-8 strings to appear directly in text RFCs
   under restricted circumstances.]


10.  Approval and Authorization

   Placeholder: In its capacity as the body that approves the general
   policy followed by the RFC Editor [RFC2850], [RFC5620]), the RSOC or
   full IAB would eventually need to review and sign off on this
   proposal after its tentative approval by the RFC Series Editor (RSE).


11.  Security Considerations

   This specification addresses documentation standards and adding
   additional flexibility to them.  It does not, in general, raise any
   security issues.  However, unless the specifications of this document
   are carefully followed, the image format recommended, PDF, may
   potentially contain external references or scripts that could

   introduce security problems.  That problem could be largely or
   completely alleviated, and long-term stability improved, by exclusive
   use of the PDF/A format as discussed in Section 3.  The RFC Editor
   and other publishers should exercise due care to ensure that no such
   references or scripts appear in the archives.


12.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no actions by the IANA.  An intentional
   consequence of the model is that IANA will not need to inspect the
   image file in order to carry out its task of evaluating proposed RFCs
   for potential actions.


13.  Acknowledgments

   The impetus for this specification arose during a discussion during
   an RFC Editorial Board meeting after one of the IETF's many
   discussions about "modern" formats for RFCs.  Aaron Falk made several
   specific suggestions that have been reflected in the document.  The
   RFC Editor staff and other Editorial Board members contributed
   suggestions without which this version would not have been possible,
   as did Steve Bellovin, Alfred Hoenes, Olaf Kolkman, and Henrik
   Levkowetz.

Appendix A.  Change Log

A.1.  Version -03

   Conversations about the formats of RFCs are restarting at IETF 83 in
   March 2012.  This version of this draft is a minor update of the
   November 2008 version -02 to enter it into that discussion.  It
   reflects changes in ISO standards and the RFC Editor model since 2008
   as well as a few minor editorial corrections.
