Abstract

   Historically MPLS label distribution was driven by session oriented
   protocols.  In order to obtain a particular routers label binding for
   a given destination FEC one needs to have first an established
   session with that node.

   This document describes a mechanism to distribute FEC/label mappings
   trough flooding protocols.  Flooding protocols publish their objects
   for an unknown set of receivers, therefore one can efficiently scale
   label distribution for use cases where the receiver of label
   information is not directly connected.

   Application of this technique are found in the field of backup (LFA)
   computation, Label switched path stitching, traffic engineering and
   egress link load balancing.

1.  Introduction

   MPLS label allocations are predominantly distributed by using the LDP
   [RFC5036], RSVP [RFC5151] or labeled BGP [RFC3107] protocol.  All of
   those protocols have in common that they are session oriented, which
   means that in order to learn the Label Information database of a
   particular router one needs to have a direct control-plane session
   using the given protocol.

   There are a couple of interesting use cases where the consumer of a
   MPLS label allocation may not be adjacent to the router having
   allocated the label.  Bringing up an explicit session using existing
   label distribution protocols between the non-adjacent label allocator
   and the label consumer is the existing remedy for this dilemma.

   For LDP protection routingLDP next next hop labels [NNHOP] have been
   proposed to provide the 2 hop neighborhood labels.  While the 2 hop
   neighborhood provides good backup coverage for the typical network
   operator topology it is inadequate for some sparse for example ring
   like topologies.

   Depending on the application, retrieval and setup of forwarding state
   of such >1 hop label allocations may only be transient.  As such
   configuring and un-configuring the explicit session is an operational
   burden and therefore should be avoided.


2.  Motivation and Applicability

   It may not be immediate obvious, however introduction of Remote LFA
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa] technology has implied important changes
   for an IGP implementation.  Previously the IGP had a one-way
   communication path with the LDP module.  The IGP supplies tracking
   routes and LDP selects the best neighbor based upon FEC to tracking
   routes exact matching results.  Remote LFA changes that relationship
   such that there is a bi-directional communication path between the
   IGP and LDP.  Now the IGP needs to learn about if a label switched
   path to a given destination prefix has been established and what the
   ingress label for getting there is.  The IGP needs to push that label
   for the tracking routes of destinations beyond a remote LFA neighbor.

   Since the IGP now creates forwarding state based on label information
   it may make sense to distribute label by the IGP as well.  This
   section lists example applications of IGP distribution of MPLS
   labels.

2.1.  Explicit One hop tunnels

   Deployment of Loop free alternate backup technology RFC 5286
   [RFC5286] results in backup graphs whose coverage is highly dependent
   on the underlying Layer-3 topology.  Typical network deployments
   provide backup coverage less than 100 percent (see RFC 6571 Section
   4.3 for Results [RFC6571]) for IGP destination prefixes.

   By closer examining the coverage gaps from the referenced production
   network topologies, it becomes obvious that most topologies lacking
   backup coverage are close to ring shaped topologies (Figure 1).

                 +-----+

                 +-----+
                /       \
               / M1      \ M4 >= (M1 + M2 + M3)

                \       /
                 +-----+
                 |  E  |
                 +-----+

                      Figure 1: Coverage gap analysis

   The protection router (PLR) evaluates for a primary path to
   destination 'D' if {E -> H -> D} is a viable backup path.  Because
   the metric M4 {H -> D} is higher than the sum of the original primary
   path and the path from router 'H' to the PLR, this particular path
   would result in a loop and therefore is rejected.

   Remote LFA [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa] has introduced the notion of
   "remote" LFA neighbor.  A helper Router which is both in P and Q
   space could forward the traffic to the final destination.  Router 'H'
   is in P space, however due to the actual metric allocation router 'H'
   is not in Q space.

   Now consider that router 'H' would advertise a label for FEC 'D',
   which has the semantics that H will POP the label and forward to the
   destination node 'D'.  This is done irrespective of the underlying
   IGP metric 'M4' it is a 'strict forwarding' label.  The PLR router
   can now construct a label stack where the outermost label provides
   transport to router 'H'.  The next label on the MPLS stack is the IGP

   learned 'strict forwarding label' label.  Note that the label 'strict
   forwarding' semantics are similar to a 1-hop ERO (Explicit route
   object).  The Remote 'LFA' calculation would ned to get changed, such
   that even if a node is not in PQ space, but rather in P space, it may
   get used as a backup neighbor if it advertises a strict forwarding
   label to the final destination.  A recursive version of the algorithm
   is applicable as well as long a node in P space has some non looping
   LSP path to the final destination.  The PLR router can now program a
   backup path irrespective of the undesirable underlying layer-3
   topology.

2.2.  Egress ASBR Link Selection

   In the ingress router 'S' is facing a dilemma (Figure 2).  Router S
   receives a BGP route from all of its 4 upstream routers.  Using
   existing mechanism the provider owning AS1 can control the loading of
   its direct links *to* its ASBR3 and ASBR4, however it cannot control
   the load of the links beyond the ASBRs, except manually tweaking the
   BGP import policy and filtering out a certain prefix.  It would be be
   more desirable to have visibility of all four BGP paths and be able
   to control the loading of those four paths using Weighted ECMP.  Note
   that the computation of the 'Weight' percentage and the component
   doing this computation (Network embedded/SDN) is outside the scope of
   this document.

   If all the ASes would be under one common administrative control then
   the network operator could deploy a forwarding hierarchy by using
   [RFC3107] to learn about the remote-AS BGP nexthop addresses and
   associated labels.  An ingress router 'S' would then stack the
   transport label to its local egress ASBR and the remote ASBR supplied
   label.  In reality it is hard to convince a peering AS to deploy
   another protocol just in order to easier control the egress load on
   the WAN links for the ingress AS.

   A 'strict forwarding' paradigm would solve this problem: An Egress
   ASBR (e.g.  ASBR 3 and 4) allocates a strict forwarding label toward
   all of its peering ASes and advertises it into its local IGP.  The
   forwarding state of all those labels is to POP off the label and
   forward to the respective interface.  The ingress router 'S' then
   builds a MPLS label stack by combining its local transport label to
   ASBR3 or ASBR4 with the IGP learned label pointing to the remote-AS
   ASBR.

2.3.  Explicit Path Routing through Label Stacking

   IGP advertised strict forwarding labels can be utilized for
   constructing simple EROs via virtue of the MPLS label stack.  In a
   classical traffic engineering problem (Figure 3) is illustrated.  The
   best IGP path between {S,D} is {S, R3, R4, D}.  Unfortunately this
   path is congested.  It turns out that the links {S, R1}, {R1, R4} and
   {R2, R4} do have some spare capacity.  In the past a C-SPF
   calculation would have passed the ERO {S, R1, R4, R2, D} down to RSVP
   for signaling.  The conceptional problem with RSVP signaled paths is
   that they cannot by shared with other nodes in the network.  Hence
   all potential ingress routers need to setup their "private" ERO path
   and allocate network signaling resources and forwarding state.

              Figure 3: Explicit Routing using Label stacking

   Consider now every router along the path does advertise a strict
   forwarding label for its direct neighbor.  Router S could now
   construct a couple of paths for avoiding the hot links without
   explicitly signaling them.

   o  {S, R1, R2, D}

   o  {S, R1, R4, D}

   o  {S, R1, R4, R2, D}

   Note that not every hop in the ERO needs to be unique label in the
   label stack.  This is undesired as existing forwarding hardware
   technology has got upper limits how much labels can get pushed on the
   label stack.  In fact an existing tunnel (for example LDP tunnel {S,
   R1, R2} can be reused for certain path segments.

2.4.  Stitching MPLS Label Switched Path Segments

   One of the shortcomings of existing traffic-engineering solutions is
   that existing label switched paths cannot get advertised and shared
   by many ingress routers in the network.  In the example network
   (Figure 4) a LSP with an ERO of {R4, R2, R6} has been established in
   order to utilize two unused north / south links.  The only way to
   attract traffic to that LSP is to advertise the LSP as a forwarding
   adjacency.  This causes loss of the original path information which
   might be interesting for a potential router which might wants to use
   this LSP for backup purposes.  A computing router would need to have
   all underlying fate-sharing and bandwidth utilization information.

                    Figure 4: Advertising path segments

   The IGP on R4 can now advertise the LSP segment by advertising its
   ingress label and optionally pass the original ERO, such that any
   upstream router can do their fate-sharing computations.  Potential
   ingress routers now can use this LSP as a segment of the overall LSP.
   Furthermore ingress routers can combine label advertisements from
   different routers along the path.  For example router S could stacks
   its LDP path to R2 {S, R1, R2} plus the IGP learned RSVP LSP {R4, R5,
   R6} plus a strict forwarding label {R6, D}.
