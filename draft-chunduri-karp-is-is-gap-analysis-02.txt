Internet-Draft      KARP IS-IS security gap analysis        October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document analyzes the current state of Intermediate system to
   Intermediate system (IS-IS) protocol according to the requirements
   set forth in [RFC6518] for both manual and key management protocols.

   With currently published work, IS-IS meets some of the requirements
   expected from a manually keyed routing protocol.  Integrity
   protection is expanded with more cryptographic algorithms and also
   limited algorithm agility (HMAC-SHA family) is provided with
   [RFC5310].  Basic form of Intra-connection re-keying capability is
   provided by the specification [RFC5310] with some gaps as explained
   in Section 3.

   This draft summarizes the current state of cryptographic key usage in
   IS-IS protocol and several previous efforts to analyze IS-IS
   security.  This includes base IS-IS specification [RFC1195],
   [RFC5304], [RFC5310] and the OPSEC working group document [RFC6039].
   Authors would like to acknowledge all the previous work done in the
   above documents.

   This document also analyzes applicability of various threats as
   described in [ietf-karp-threats-reqs] to IS-IS, lists gaps and
   provides specific recommendations to thwart the applicable threats
   for both manual keying and for auto key management mechanisms.

2.  Current State

   IS-IS is specified in International Standards Organization (ISO)
   10589, with extensions to support Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)
   described in [RFC1195].  The specification includes an authentication
   mechanism that allows for any authentication algorithm and also
   specifies the algorithm for clear text passwords.  Further [RFC5304]
   extends the authentication mechanism to work with HMAC-MD5 and also
   modifies the base protocol for more effectiveness.  [RFC5310]
   provides algorithm agility, with new generic crypto authentication
   mechanism (CRYPTO_AUTH) for IS-IS.  The CRYPTO_AUTH also introduces
   Key ID mechanism that map to unique IS-IS Security Associations
   (SAs).

   The following sections describe the current authentication key usage
   for various IS-IS messages, current key change methodologies and the
   various potential security threats.

2.1.  Key Usage

   IS-IS can be provisioned with a per interface, peer-to-peer key for
   IS-IS HELLO PDUs (IIH) and a group key for Link State PDUs (LSPs) and
   Sequence number PDUs (SNPs).  If provisioned, IIH packets potentially
   can use the same group key used for LSPs and SNPs.

2.1.1.  Sub network Independent

   Link State PDUs, Complete and partial Sequence Number PDUs come under
   Sub network Independent messages.  For protecting Level-1 SNPs and
   Level-1 LSPs, provisioned Area Authentication key is used.  Level-2
   SNPs as well as Level-2 LSPs use the provisioned domain
   authentication key.

   Since authentication is performed on the LSPs transmitted by an IS,
   rather than on the LSP packets transmitted to a specific neighbor, it
   is implied that all the ISes within a single flooding domain must be
   configured with the same key in order for authentication to work
   correctly.  This is also true for SNP packets, though they are
   limited to link local scope in broadcast networks.

Internet-Draft      KARP IS-IS security gap analysis        October 2012


2.1.2.  Sub network dependent

   IS-IS HELLO PDUs use the Link Level Authentication key, which may be
   different from that of Link State PDUs (LSPs) and Sequence number
   PDUs (SNPs).  This could be particularly true for point-to-point
   links.  In broadcast networks it is possible to provision the same
   common key used for LSPs and SNPs, to protect IIH messages.  This
   allows neighbor discovery and adjacency formation with more than one
   neighbor on the same physical interface.

2.2.  Key Agility

   Key roll over without effecting the routing protocols operation in
   general and IS-IS in particular, is critical for effective key
   management protocol integration.

   Current HMAC-MD5 crypto authentication as defined in [RFC5304],
   suggests a transition mode, so that ISes use a set of keys when
   verifying the authentication value, to allow key changes.  This
   approach will allow changing the authentication key manually without
   bringing down the adjacency and without dropping any control packet.
   But, this can increase the load on control plane for the key
   transition duration as each control packet may have to be verified by
   more than one key and also allows to mount a potential Denial of
   Service (DoS) attack in the transition duration.

   The above situation is improved with the introduction of Key ID
   mechanism as defined in [RFC5310].  With this, the receiver
   determines the active security association (SA) by looking at the Key
   ID field in the incoming PDU and need not try with other keys, when
   the integrity check or digest verification fails.  But, neither Key
   co-ordination across the group nor exact key change mechanism is
   clearly defined.  [RFC5310] says: " Normally, an implementation would
   allow the network operator to configure a set of keys in a key chain,
   with each key in the chain having a fixed lifetime.  The actual
   operation of these mechanisms is outside the scope of this document."

2.3.  Security Issues

   The following section analyzes various security threats possible, in
   the current state for IS-IS protocol.

2.3.1.  Replay Attacks

   Replaying a captured protocol packet to cause damage is a common
   threat for any protocol.  Securing the packet with cryptographic
   authentication information alone can not mitigate this threat
   completely.  Though this problem is more prevalent in broadcast

   networks it is important to note, most of the IGP deployments use
   P2P-over-lan [RFC5309], which makes an adversary replay 'easier' than
   the traditional P2P networks

   In intra-session replay attacks a secured protocol packet of the
   current session is replayed, can cause damage, if there is no other
   mechanism to confirm this is a replay packet.  In inter-session
   replay attacks, captured packet from one of the previous session can
   be replayed to cause the damage.  IS-IS packets are vulnerable to
   both these attacks, as there is no sequence number verification for
   IIH packets and SNP packets.  Also with current manual key management
   periodic key changes across the group are done rarely.  Thus the
   intra-connection and inter-connection replay requirements are not
   met.

   IS-IS specifies the use of the HMAC-MD5 [RFC5304] and HMAC-SHA-1
   family in [RFC5310], to protect IS-IS packets.  An adversary could
   replay old IIHs or replay old SNPs that would cause churn in the
   network or bring down the adjacencies.

   1.  At the time of adjacency bring up an IS sends IIH packet with
       empty neighbor list (TLV 6) and with the authentication
       information as per provisioned authentication mechanism.  If this
       packet is replayed later on the broadcast network, all ISes in
       the broadcast network can bounce the adjacency to create a huge
       churn in the network.

   2.  Today Link State PDUs (LSPs) have intra-session replay protection
       as LSP header contains 32-bit sequence number which is verified
       for every received packet against the local LSP database.  But,
       if the key is not changed, an adversary can cause an inter-
       session replay attack by replaying a old LSP with higher sequence
       number and fewer prefixes or fewer adjacencies.  This may force
       the receiver to accept and remove the routes from the routing
       table, which eventually causes traffic disruption to those
       prefixes.

   3.  In any IS-IS network (broadcast or otherwise), if a old and an
       empty Complete Sequence Number packet (CSNP) is replayed this can
       cause LSP flood in the network.  Similarly a replayed Partial
       Sequence Number packet (PSNP) can cause LSP flood in the
       broadcast network.

2.3.2.  Spoofing Attacks

   IS-IS shares the same key between all neighbors in an area or in a
   domain to protect the LSP, SNP packets and in broadcast networks even
   IIH packets.  False advertisement by a router is not within scope of

   the KARP work.  However, given the wide sharing of keys as described
   above, there is a significant risk that an attacker can compromise a
   key from one device, and use it to falsely participate in the
   routing, possibly even in a very separate part of the network.
   Possession of the key it self is used as authentication check and
   there is no identity check separately.  Spoofing occurs when an
   illegitimate device assumes the identity of a legitimate one.  An
   attacker can use spoofing as a means for launching various types of
   attacks.  For example:

   1.  The attacker can send out unrealistic routing information that
       might cause the disruption of network services such as block
       holes.

   2.  A rogue system having access to the common key used to protect
       the LSP, can send an LSP, setting the Remaining Lifetime field to
       zero, and flooding it thereby initiating a purge.  Subsequently,
       this also can cause the sequence number of all the LSPs to
       increase quickly to max out the sequence number space, which can
       cause an IS to shut down for MaxAge + ZeroAgeLifetime period to
       allow the old LSPs to age out in other ISes of the same flooding
       domain.

2.3.3.  DoS Attacks

   Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks using the authentication mechanism is
   possible and an attacker can send packets which can overwhelm the
   security mechanism itself.  An example is initiating an overwhelming
   load of spoofed but integrity protected protocol packets, so that the
   receiver needs to process the integrity check, only to discard the
   packet.  This can cause significant CPU usage.  DoS attacks are not
   generally preventable with in the routing protocol.  As the attackers
   are often remote, the DoS attacks are more damaging to area-scoped or
   domain-scoped packet receivers than link-local scoped packet
   receivers.


3.  Gap Analysis and Security Requirements

   This section outlines the differences between the current state of
   the IS-IS routing protocol and the desired state as specified in KARP
   Design Guidelines [RFC6518].  The section focuses on where IS-IS
   protocol fails to meet general requirements as specified in the
   threats and requirements document.

   This section also describes security requirements that should be met
   by IS-IS implementations that are secured by manual as well as auto
   key management protocols.

Internet-Draft      KARP IS-IS security gap analysis        October 2012


3.1.  Manual Key Management

   1.  With CRYPTO_AUTH specification [RFC5310], IS-IS packets can be
       protected with HMAC-SHA family of cryptographic algorithms.  The
       specification provides the limited algorithm agility (SHA
       family).  By using Key IDs, it also conceals the algorithm
       information from the protected control messages.

   2.  Even though both intra and inter session replay attacks are best
       prevented by deploying key management protocols with frequent key
       change capability, basic constructs for sequence number should be
       there in the protocol messages.  So, some basic or extended
       sequence number mechanism should be in place to protect IIH
       packets and SNP packets.  The sequence number should be increased
       for each protocol packet.  This allows mitigation of some of the
       replay threats as mentioned in Section 2.3.1.

   3.  Any common key mechanism with keys shared across a group of
       routers is susceptible to spoofing attacks caused by a malicious
       router.  Separate authentication check (apart from the integrity
       check to verify the digest) with digital signatures as described
       in [RFC2154], can effectively nullify this attack.  But this
       approach was never deployed and one can only assume due to
       operational considerations at that time.  The alternative
       approach to thwart this threat would be by using the keys from
       the group key management protocol.  As the group key(s) are
       generated by authenticating the member ISes in the group first,
       and then periodically rekeyed, per packet identity or
       authentication check may not be needed.

   4.  In general DoS attacks may not be preventable with mechanism from
       routing protocols itself.  But some form of Admin controlled
       lists (ACLs) at the forwarding plane can reduce the damage.
       There are some other forms the DoS attacks common to any protocol
       are not in scope as per the section 2.2 in [I-D.ietf-karp-
       threats-reqs].

   As discussed in Section 2.2, though Key ID mechanism in [RFC5310]
   helps, better key co-ordination mechanism for key roll over is
   desirable even with manual key management.  But, it fell short of
   specifying exact mechanism other than using key chains.  The specific
   requirements:

   a.  Keys SHOULD be able to change without affecting the established
       adjacency and even better without any control packet loss.

   b.  Keys SHOULD be able to change without effecting the protocol
       operations, for example, LSP flooding should not be help for a

       specific Key ID availability.

   c.  Any proposed mechanism SHOULD also be further incrementally
       deployable with key management protocols.

3.2.  Key Management Protocols

   In broadcast deployments, the keys used for protecting IS-IS
   protocols messages can, in particular, be group keys.  A mechanism,
   similar to as described in [I-D.weis-gdoi-mac-tek] can be used to
   distribute group keys to a group of ISes in Level-1 area or Level-2
   domain, using GDOI as specified in [RFC6407].  There are also similar
   approaches with IKEv2 ([RFC5996]) based GDOI, to routing protocols as
   described in [I-D.hartman-karp-mrkmp].

   If a group key is used, the authentication granularity becomes group
   membership of devices, not peer authentication between devices.
   Group key management protocol deployed SHOULD be capable of
   supporting rekeying support.

   In some deployments, where IS-IS point-to-point (P2P) mode is used
   for adjacency bring-up, sub network dependent messages (IIHs) can use
   a different key shared between the two point-to-point peers, while
   all other messages use a group key.  When group keying mechanism is
   deployed, even the P2P IIHs can be protected with the common group
   keys.  This approach facilitates one key management mechanism instead
   of both pair-wise keying and group keying protocols to be deployed
   together.

   As mentioned earlier, effective key change capability with in the
   routing protocol which allows key roll over without impacting the
   routing protocol operation, is one of the requirements for deploying
   any group key mechanism.  Once such mechanism is in place with
   deployment of group key management protocol, IS-IS can be protected
   from various threats not limited to intra and inter session replay
   attacks and spoofing attacks.

   Specific use of crypto tables [I-D.ietf-karp-crypto-key-table] should
   be defined for IS-IS protocol.
