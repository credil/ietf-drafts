   Miscellaneous Capabilities Negotiation in the Session Description
                             Protocol (SDP)
              draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-miscellaneous-caps-07

Abstract

   SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism
   framework that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols
   and attributes.  This framework has been extended with a media
   capabilities negotiation mechanism that allows endpoints to negotiate
   additional media-related capabilities.  This negotiation is embedded
   into the widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures.

   This memo extends the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow
   endpoints to negotiate three additional SDP capabilities.  In
   particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate bandwidth
   ('b=' line), connection data ('c=' line), and session or media titles
   ('i=' line for each session or media).

1.  Introduction

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] is intended for
   describing multimedia sessions for the purposes of session
   announcement, session invitation, and other forms of multimedia
   session initiation.  SDP has been extended with a SDP Capability
   Negotiation Mechanism Framework [RFC5939] which allows the endpoints
   to negotiate capabilities, such as support for Real-time Transport

   Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] and Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
   (SRTP) [RFC3711].  The SDP Media Capabilities Negotiation [RFC6871]
   provides negotiation capabilities to media lines as well.

   The capability negotiation is embedded into the widely used SDP offer
   /answer procedure [RFC3264].  This memo provides the means to
   negotiate further capabilities than those specified in the SDP
   Capability Negotiation Mechanism Framework [RFC5939] and the SDP
   Media Capabilities Negotiation [RFC6871].  In particular, this memo
   provides a mechanism to negotiate bandwidth ('b='), connection data
   ('c='), and session or media titles ('i=').

   Since the three added capabilities are independent, it is not
   expected that implementations will necessarily support all of them at
   the same time.  Instead, it is expected that applications will choose
   their needed capability for their specific purpose.  Due to this, we
   are writing the normative part pertaining to each capability in a
   self-contained section: Section 3.1.1 describes the bandwidth
   capability extension, Section 3.1.2 describes the connection data
   capability extension, and Section 3.1.3 describes the title
   capability extension.  Separate SDP capability negotiation option
   tags are defined for each capability, allowing endpoints to indicate
   and/or require support for these extensions according to procedures
   defined in SDP Capability Negotiation [RFC5939].

3.  Protocol Description

3.1.  Extensions to SDP

   The SDP Capability Negotiation Framework [RFC5939] and the SDP Media
   Capabilities Negotiation [RFC6871] specify attributes for negotiating
   SDP capabilities.  These documents specify new attributes (e.g.,
   'acap', 'tcap', 'rmcap', 'omcap') for achieving their purpose.  In
   this document we define three new additional capability attributes
   for SDP lines of the general form:

      type=value

   for types 'b', 'c', and 'i'.  The corresponding capability attributes
   are respectively defined as:

Internet-Draft     SDP Misc. Capabilities Negotiation          July 2013


   o  'bcap': bandwidth capability

   o  'ccap': connection data capability

   o  'icap': title capability

   From the sub-rules of attribute ('a=') line in SDP [RFC4566], SDP
   attributes are of the form:

      attribute          = (att-field ":" att-value) / att-field
      att-field          = token
      att-value          = byte-string


   Capability attributes use only the 'att-field:att-value' form.

   The new capabilities may be referenced in potential configurations
   ('a=pcfg') or in latent configurations ('a=lcfg'), as productions
   conforming to the <extension-config-list> as respectively defined in
   RFC 5939 [RFC5939] and RFC6871 [RFC6871].

      extension-config-list = ["+"] ext-cap-name "=" ext-cap-list
      ext-cap-name          = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT)
                              ; ALPHA and DIGIT defined in RFC 5234
      ext-cap-list          = 1*VCHAR  ; VCHAR defined in RFC 5234


   The optional "+" is used to indicate that the extension is mandatory
   and MUST be supported in order to use that particular configuration.

   The new capabilities may also be referenced in actual configurations
   ('a=acfg') as productions conforming to the <sel-extension-config>
   defined in RFC 5939 [RFC5939].

      sel-extension-config = ext-cap-name "=" 1*VCHAR


   The specific parameters are defined in the individual description of
   each capability, below.

   The 'bcap', 'ccap', and 'icap' capability attributes can be provided
   at the SDP session and/or media level.  According to the SDP
   Capability Negotiation [RFC5939], each extension capability must
   specify the implication of making it part of a configuration at the
   media level.

   According to SDP [RFC4566], 'b=', 'c=', and 'i=' lines may appear
   either at session or media level.  In line with this, the 'bcap',



Garcia-Martin, et al.   Expires January 11, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     SDP Misc. Capabilities Negotiation          July 2013


   'ccap', and 'icap' capability attributes, when declared at session
   level, are to be interpreted as-if that attribute was provided with
   that value at the session level.  The 'bcap', 'ccap' and 'icap'
   capability attributes declared at media level, are to be interpreted
   as-if that capability attribute was declared at the media level.

   For example, extending the example in [RFC6871] with 'icap' and
   'bcap' capability attributes, we get the following SDP:

      v=0
      o=- 25678 753849 IN IP4 192.0.2.1
      s=
      c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
      t=0 0
      a=bcap:1 CT:200
      a=icap:1 Video conference
      m=audio 54320 RTP/AVP 0
      a=rmcap:1 L16/8000/1
      a=rmcap:2 L16/16000/2
      a=pcfg:1 m=1|2 pt=1:99,2:98
      m=video 66544 RTP/AVP 100
      a=rmcap:3 H263-1998/90000
      a=rtpmap:100 H264/90000
      a=pcfg:10 m=3 pt=3:101 b=1 i=1

     Figure 1: Example SDP offer with bcap and icap defined at session
                                   level

   The above SDP defines one PCMU audio stream and one H.264 video
   stream.  It also defines two RTP-based media capabilities ('rmcap'
   numbered 1 and 2), using L16 audio at 8 kbps and 16 kbps,
   respectively, as well as an RTP-based media capability for H.263
   video ('rmcap' numbered 3).  The RTP-based media capabilities all
   appear at the media level.  The example also contains a single
   bandwidth capability ('bcap') and a single title capability ('icap'),
   both defined at session level.  According to the definition above,
   when the capabilities defined in the 'bcap' and 'icap' attributes are
   referenced from the potential configuration, in the resulting SDP
   they are to be interpreted as session level attributes (but the RTP-
   based media capabilities are to be interpreted as media level
   attributes).

3.1.1.  Bandwidth Capability

Internet-Draft     SDP Misc. Capabilities Negotiation          July 2013


   According to RFC 4566 [RFC4566] the bandwidth field denotes the
   proposed bandwidth to be used by the session or media.  In this memo
   we specify the bandwidth capability attribute which can also appear
   at the SDP session and/or media level.  The bandwidth field is
   specified in RFC 4566 [RFC4566] with the following syntax:

      b=<bwtype>:<bandwidth>

   where <bwtype> is an alphanumeric modifier giving the meaning of the
   <bandwidth> figure.

   In this document, we define a new capability attribute: the Bandwidth
   capability attribute 'bcap'.  This attribute lists bandwidth as
   capabilities according to the following definition:

      "a=bcap:" bw-cap-num 1*WSP bwtype ":" bandwidth CRLF

   where <bw-cap-num> is a unique integer within all the bandwidth
   capabilities in the entire SDP, which is used to number the bandwidth
   capability, and can take a value between 1 and 2^31-1 (both
   included).  The other elements are as defined for the 'b=' field in
   SDP [RFC4566].

   This format satisfies the general attribute production rules in SDP
   [RFC4566] according to the following Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) [RFC5234] syntax:

      att-field       =/ "bcap"
      att-value       =/ bw-cap-num 1*WSP bwtype ":" bandwidth
      bw-cap-num      = 1*10(DIGIT)   ; DIGIT defined in RFC 5234

                  Figure 2: Syntax of the bcap attribute

   Negotiation of bandwidth per media stream can be useful when
   negotiating media encoding capabilities with different bandwidths.

3.1.1.1.  Configuration Parameters

   The SDP Capability Negotiation Framework [RFC5939] provides for the
   existence of the 'pcfg' and 'acfg' attributes.  The concept is
   extended by the SDP Media Capabilities Negotiation [RFC6871] with an
   'lcfg' attribute that conveys latent configurations.

   Extensions to the 'pcfg' and 'lcfg' attributes are defined through
   <extension-config-list>, and extensions to the 'acfg' attribute are
   defined through the <sel-extension-config> as defined in the SDP
   Capability Negotiation [RFC5939].

Internet-Draft     SDP Misc. Capabilities Negotiation          July 2013


   In this document we extend the <extension-config-list> field to be
   able to convey lists of bandwidth capabilities in latent or potential
   configurations, according to the following Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) [RFC5234] syntax:

      extension-config-list  =/ bandwidth-config-list
      bandwidth-config-list  = ["+"] "b=" bw-cap-list *(BAR bw-cap-list)
                                  ; BAR defined in RFC 5939
      bw-cap-list            = bw-cap-num *("," bw-cap-num)
      bw-cap-num             = 1*10(DIGIT)   ; DIGIT defined in RFC 5234

     Figure 3: Syntax of the bandwidth parameter in 'lcfg' and 'pcfg'
                                attributes

   Each bandwidth capability configuration is a comma-separated list of
   bandwidth capability attribute numbers where <bw-cap-num> refers to
   the <bw-cap-num> bandwidth capability numbers defined explicitly
   earlier in this document, and hence MUST be between 1 and 2^31-1
   (both included).  Alternative bandwidth configurations are separated
   by a vertical bar ("|").

   The above syntax is very flexible, allowing referencing to multiple
   'b=' lines per configuration, even for the same <bwtype>.  While the
   need for such definitions is not seen, we have not restricted this,
   as it is not restricted in SDP [RFC4566] either.

   The bandwidth parameter to the actual configuration attribute
   ('a=acfg') is formulated as a <sel-extension-config> with

      ext-cap-name = "b"

   hence

      sel-extension-config =/ sel-bandwidth-config
      sel-bandwidth-config = "b=" bw-cap-list  ; bw-cap-list as above.

3.1.1.2.  Option tag












Garcia-Martin, et al.   Expires January 11, 2014                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     SDP Misc. Capabilities Negotiation          July 2013


   The SDP Capability Negotiation Framework [RFC5939] allows for
   capability negotiation extensions to be defined.  Associated with
   each such extension is an option tag that identifies the extension in
   question.  Hereby, we define a new option tag "bcap-v0" that
   identifies support for the bandwidth capability.  The endpoints using
   the 'bcap' capability attribute SHOULD add the option tag to other
   existing option tags present in the 'csup' and 'creq' attributes in
   SDP, according to the procedures defined in the SDP Capability
   Negotiation Framework [RFC5939].

3.1.2.  Connection Data Capability

   According to SDP [RFC4566], the connection data field in SDP contains
   the connection data, and it has the following syntax:

      c=<nettype> <addrtype> <connection-address>

   where <nettype> indicates the network type, <addrtype> indicates the
   address type, and the <connection-address> is the connection address,
   which is dependent on the address type.

   At the moment, network types already defined include "IN", which
   indicates Internet network type, and "ATM" (see RFC 3108 [RFC3108]),
   used for describing Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) bearer
   connections.  The Circuit-Switched (CS) descriptions in SDP document
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-cs] adds a "PSTN" network type for expressing a
   Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) circuit switch.

   SDP [RFC4566] permits specification of connection data at the SDP
   session and/or media level.  In order to permit negotiation of
   connection data at the media level, we define the connection data
   capability attribute ('a=ccap') in the form:

      "a=ccap:" conn-cap-num 1*WSP nettype SP addrtype SP connection-
      address CRLF

   where <conn-cap-num> is a unique integer within all the connection
   capabilities in the entire SDP, which is used to identify the
   connection data capability, and can take a value between 1 and 2^31-1
   (both included).  The other elements are as defined in [RFC4566].

   This format corresponds to the [RFC4566] attribute production rules
   according to the following Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] syntax:

      att-field       =/ "ccap"
      att-value       =/ conn-cap-num 1*WSP nettype SP addrtype
                        SP connection-address

      conn-cap-num    = 1*10(DIGIT)   ; 1 to 2^31-1, inclusive
                                      ; DIGIT defined in RFC 5234

                  Figure 5: Syntax of the ccap attribute

   The 'ccap' capability attribute allows for expressing alternative
   connections address ("c=") lines in SDP as part of the SDP capability
   negotiation process.  One of the primary use cases for this is
   offering alternative connection addresses where the <nettype> is "IN"
   or "PSTN", i.e. selecting between IP based bearer or a circuit-
   switched bearer.

   By supporting the "IN" <nettype>, the 'ccap' attribute enables the
   signaling of multiple IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, however the Standards
   Track mechanism for negotiation of alternative IP addresses in SDP is
   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245].  The 'ccap'
   attribute does not change that and hence the combined set of actual
   and potential configurations (as defined in [RFC5939]) for any given
   media description MUST NOT use the 'ccap' attribute to negotiate more
   than one address with an IN network type (i.e., it is not permissible
   to select between "IP4" and "IP6" address families or different IP
   addresses within the same IP address family.

   Figure 6 is an example of an SDP offer that includes a 'ccap'
   capability attribute.  An audio stream can be setup with an RTP flow
   or establishing a circuit-switched audio stream:


             v=0
             o=2987933123 2987933123 IN IP4 198.51.100.7

       Figure 8: Equivalent SDP offer with the circuit-switched flow

   This document does not define any mechanism for negotiating or
   describing different port numbers and hence the port number from the
   "m=" line MUST be used by default.  Exceptions to this default can be
   provided by extension mechanisms or network type specific rules.
   This draft defines an exception when the network type is "PSTN", in
   which case the port number is replaced with 9 (the "discard" port) as
   described in Session Decription Protocol (SDP) Extension For Setting
   Up Audio and Video Media Streams over Circuit-Switched Bearers in the
   Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-cs].
   An endpoint offering alternative IP and PSTN bearers MUST include the
   IP media description in the actual configuration (IP address in the
   "c=" line and port number in the "m=" line), and the PSTN media
   description in the potential configuration.

   Exceptions for other network types, such as for the "ATM" network
   type defined in [RFC3108], require additional specifications.

Internet-Draft     SDP Misc. Capabilities Negotiation          July 2013


3.1.2.1.  Configuration Parameters

   The SDP Capability Negotiation Framework [RFC5939] provides for the
   existence of the 'pcfg' and 'acfg' attributes, which can convey one
   or more configurations to be negotiated.  The concept is extended by
   the SDP Media Capabilities Negotiation [RFC6871] with an 'lcfg'
   attribute that conveys latent configurations.

   In this document we define a <connection-config> parameter to be used
   to specify a connection data capability in a potential or latent
   configuration attribute.  The parameter follows the form of an
   <extension-config-list>, with

      ext-cap-name = "c"

      ext-cap-list = conn-cap-list

   where, according to the following Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] syntax:

      extension-config-list =/ conn-config-list
      conn-config-list      = ["+"] "c=" conn-cap-list
      conn-cap-list         = conn-cap-num *(BAR conn-cap-num)
      conn-cap-num          = 1*10(DIGIT)   ; 1 to 2^32-1 inclusive

      Figure 9: Syntax of the connection data parameter in 'lcfg' and
                             'pcfg' attributes

   Each capability configuration alternative contains a single
   connection data capability attribute number and refers to the conn-
   cap-num capability number defined explicitly earlier in this
   document, and hence MUST be between 1 and 2^31-1 (both included).
   The connection data capability allows the expression of only a single
   capability in each alternative, rather than a list of capabilities,
   since no more than a single connection data field is permitted per
   media block.  Nevertheless, it is still allowed to express
   alternative potential connection configurations separated by a
   vertical bar ("|").

   An endpoint includes a plus sign ("+") in the configuration attribute
   to mandate support for this extension.  An endpoint that receives
   this parameter prefixed with a plus sign and does not support this
   extension MUST treat that potential configuration as not valid.

   The connection data parameter to the actual configuration attribute
   ('a=acfg') is formulated as a <sel-extension-config> with

      ext-cap-name = "c"

   hence

      sel-extension-config =/ sel-connection-config
      sel-connection-config = "c=" conn-cap-num  ; as defined above.

       Figure 10: Syntax of the connection data parameter in 'acfg'
                                attributes

3.1.2.2.  Option tag

   The SDP Capability Negotiation Framework [RFC5939] solution allows
   for capability negotiation extensions to be defined.  Associated with
   each such extension is an option tag that identifies the extension in
   question.  Hereby, we define a new option tag of "ccap-v0" that
   identifies support for the connection data capability.  This option
   tag SHOULD be added to other existing option tags present in the
   'csup' and 'creq' attributes in SDP, according to the procedures
   defined in the SDP Capability Negotiation Framework [RFC5939].

3.1.3.  Title Capability

   SDP [RFC4566] provides for the existence of an information field
   expressed in the format of the 'i=' line, which can appear at the SDP
   session and/or media level.  An 'i=' line that is present at the
   session level is known as the "session name", and its purpose is to
   convey human-readable textual information about the session.

   The 'i=' line in SDP can also appear at the media level, in which
   case it is used to provide human-readable information about the media
   stream to which it is related, e.g., it may indicate the purpose of
   the media stream.  The 'i=' line is not to be confused with the label
   attribute ('a=label:', [RFC4574]) which provides a machine-readable
   tag.  It is foreseen that applications declaring capabilities related
   to different configurations of a media stream may need to provide
   different identifying information for each of those configurations.
   That is, a party might offer alternative media configurations for a
   stream, each of which represents a different presentation of the same
   or similar information.  For example, an audio stream might offer
   English or Spanish configurations, or a video stream might offer a
   choice of video source such as speaker camera, group camera, or
   document viewer.  The title capability is needed to inform the
   answering user in order to select the proper choice, and the label is
   used to inform the offering machine which choice the answerer has
   selected.  Hence, there is value in defining a mechanism to provide
   titles of media streams as capabilities.

   As defined in SDP [RFC4566], the session information field ("i=",
   referred to as "title" in this document) is subject to the



Garcia-Martin, et al.   Expires January 11, 2014               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft     SDP Misc. Capabilities Negotiation          July 2013


   "a=charset" attribute in order to support different character sets
   and hence internationalization.  The title capability attribute
   itself ("a=icap") is however not subject to the "a=charset" attribute
   as this would preclude the inclusion of alternative session/title
   information each using different character sets.  Instead, the
   session/title value embedded in an "a=icap" attribute (title
   capability) will be subject to the "a=charset" value used within a
   configuration that includes that title capability.  This provides for
   consistent SDP operation while allowing for capabilities and
   configurations with different session/title information values with
   different character set encodings (with each such configuration
   including an "a=charset" value with the relevant character set for
   the session/title information in question).

   According to SDP [RFC4566], the session information ('i=') line has
   the following syntax:

      "i=" text

   where "text" represents a human-readable text indicating the purpose
   of the session or media stream.

   In this document we define a new capability attribute: the Title
   capability 'icap'.  This attribute lists session or media titles as
   capabilities, according to the following definition:

      "a=icap:" title-cap-num 1*WSP text

   where <title-cap-num> is a unique integer within all the connection
   capabilities in the entire SDP, which is used to identify the
   particular title capability, and can take a value between 1 and
   2^31-1 (both included). <text> is a human-readable text that
   indicates the purpose of the session or media stream it is supposed
   to characterize.

   As an example, one might use:

      a=icap:1 Document Camera

   to define a title capability number 1 to identify a particular source
   of a media stream.

   Or in another example, one might offer two title capabilities with
   different character encodings (using the charset attribute defined in
   SDP: Session Description Protocol [RFC4566] and the generic attribute
   capability attribute ("a=acap:") defined in SDP Capability
   Negotiation [RFC5939].

            a=icap:1 [Text encoded in ISO-8859-1]
            a=acap:1 charset:ISO-8859-1
            a=icap:2 [Text encoded in UTF-8]
            a=acap:2 charset:UTF-8


   NOTE: Due to limitations of the ASCII encoding of RFCs, the actual
   text with non-printable characters cannot be represented in the text
   version, but might be represented in other versions of this RFC.

   The title capability attribute satisfies the general attribute
   production rules in SDP [RFC4566] according to the following
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] syntax:

      att-field       =/ "icap"
      att-value       =/ title-cap-num 1*WSP text
                                  ; text defined in RFC 4566
      title-cap-num   = 1*10(DIGIT)   ; DIGIT defined in RFC 5234

                  Figure 11: Syntax of the icap attribute

3.1.3.1.  Configuration Parameters

   The SDP Capability Negotiation Framework [RFC5939] provides for the
   existence of the 'pcfg' and 'acfg' attributes.  The concept is
   extended by the SDP Media Capabilities Negotiation [RFC6871] with an
   'lcfg' attribute that conveys latent configurations.

   In this document, we define a <title-config-list> parameter to be
   used to convey title capabilities in a potential or latent
   configuration.  This parameter is defined as an <extension-config-
   list> with the following associations:

      ext-cap-name = "i"

      ext-cap-list = title-cap-list

   This leads to the following definition for the title capability
   parameter:

      extension-config-list =/ title-config-list
      title-config-list     = ["+"] "i=" title-cap-list
      title-cap-list        = title-cap-num *(BAR title-cap-num)
                                      ; BAR defined in RFC 5939
      title-cap-num         = 1*10(DIGIT) ; DIGIT defined in RFC 5234

                             'pcfg' attributes

   Each potential capability configuration contains a single title
   capability attribute number where 'title-cap-num' is the title
   capability number defined explicitly earlier in this document, and
   hence must be between 1 and 2^31-1 (both included).  The title
   capability allows the expression of only a single capability in each
   alternative, since no more than a single title field is permitted per
   block.  Nevertheless, it is still allowed to express alternative
   potential title configurations separated by a vertical bar ("|").

   An endpoint includes a plus sign ("+") in the configuration attribute
   to mandate support for this extension.  An endpoint that receives
   this parameter prefixed with a plus sign and does not support this
   extension MUST treat that potential configuration as not valid.

   The title parameter to the actual configuration attribute ('a=acfg')
   is formulated as a <sel-extension-config> with

      ext-cap-name = "i"

   hence

      sel-extension-config =/ sel-title-config
      sel-title-config = "i=" title-cap-num  ; as defined above.

       Figure 13: Syntax of the title parameter in 'acfg' attributes

3.1.3.2.  Option Tag

   At present, it is difficult to envision a scenario in which the
   'icap' attribute must be supported or the offer must be rejected.  In
   most cases, if the icap attribute or its contents were to be ignored,
   an offered configuration could still be chosen based on other
   criteria such as configuration numbering.  However, one might imagine
   an SDP offer that contained English and Spanish potential
   configurations for an audio stream.  The session might be
   unintelligible if the choice is based on configuration numbering,
   rather than informed user selection.  Based on such considerations,
   it may well prove useful to announce the ability to use the icap
   attribute and its contents to select media configurations, or to
   inform the user about the selected configuration(s).  Therefore, we
   define a new option tag of "icap-v0" that identifies support for the
   title capability.  This option tag SHOULD be added to other existing
   option tags present in the 'csup' and/or 'creq' attributes in SDP,
   according to the procedures defined in the SDP Capability Negotiation
   Framework [RFC5939].  The discussion above suggests that "icap-v0"
   will typically appear in a 'csup' attribute, but rarely in a 'creq'
   attribute.

3.2.  Session Level versus Media Level

   The 'bcap', 'ccap' and 'icap' attributes can appear at the SDP
   session and/or media level.  Endpoints MUST interpret capabilities
   declared at session level as part of the session level in the
   resulting SDP for that particular configuration.  Endpoints MUST
   interpret capabilities declared at media description as part of the
   media level in the resulting SDP for that particular configuration.

   The presence of the 'bcap' capability for the same <bwtype> at both
   the session and media level is subject to the same constraints and
   restrictions specified in RFC 4566 [RFC4566] for the bandwidth
   attribute "b=".

   To avoid confusion, the <type-attr-num> for each 'a=bcap', 'a=ccap',
   and 'a=icap' line MUST be unique across all capability attributes of
   the same type within the entire session description.

3.3.  Offer/Answer model extensions

   In this section, we define extensions to the offer/answer model
   defined in SDP Offer/Answer Model [RFC3264] and extended in the SDP
   Capability Negotiation [RFC5939] to allow for bandwidth, connection,
   and title capabilities to be used with the SDP Capability Negotiation
   framework.

3.3.1.  Generating the Initial Offer

   When an endpoint generates an initial offer and wants to use the
   functionality described in the current document, it first defines
   appropriate values for the bandwidth, connection data, and/or title
   capability attributes according to the rules defined in [RFC4566] for
   'b=', 'c=' and 'i=' lines.  The endpoint then MUST include the
   respective capability attributes and associated values in the SDP
   offer.  The preferred configurations for each media stream are
   identified following the media line in a 'pcfg' attribute.  Bandwidth
   and title capabilities may also be referenced in latent
   configurations in an 'lcfg' attribute, defined in SDP Media
   Capabilities Negotiation [RFC6871].

   Implementations are advised to pay attention to the port number that
   is used in the "m=" line.  By default, a potential configuration that
   includes a connection data capability will use the port number from
   the "m=" line, unless the network type is "PSTN", in which case the
   default port number used will be 9.






Garcia-Martin, et al.   Expires January 11, 2014               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft     SDP Misc. Capabilities Negotiation          July 2013


   The offer SHOULD include the level of capability negotiation
   extensions needed to support this functionality in a 'creq'
   attribute.

3.3.2.  Generating the Answer

   When the answering party receives the offer, and if it supports the
   required capability negotiation extensions, it SHOULD select the most
   preferred configuration it can support for each media stream, and
   build the answer accordingly, as defined in Section 3.6.2 of the SDP
   Capability Negotiation [RFC5939].

   If the connection data capability is used in a selected potential
   configuration chosen by the answerer, that offer configuration MUST
   by default use the port number from the actual offer configuration
   (i.e. the "m=" line), unless the network type is "PSTN", in which
   case the default port MUST be assumed to be 9.  Extensions may be
   defined to negotiate the port number explicitly instead.

3.3.3.  Offerer Processing of the Answer

   When the offerer receives the answer, it MUST process the media lines
   according to normal SDP processing rules to identify the media
   stream(s) accepted by the answer, if any, as defined in Section 3.6.3
   of the SDP Capability Negotiation [RFC5939].  The 'acfg' attribute,
   if present, MUST be used to verify the proposed configuration used to
   form the answer, and to infer the lack of acceptability of higher-
   preference configurations that were not chosen.

3.3.4.  Modifying the Session

   If, at a later time, one of the parties wishes to modify the
   operating parameters of a session, e.g. by adding a new media stream,
   or by changing the properties used on an existing stream, it may do
   so via the mechanisms defined for SDP offer/answer [RFC3264] and in
   accordance with the procedures defined in Section 3.6.4 of the SDP
   Capability Negotiation [RFC5939].

4.  Field Replacement Rules

Internet-Draft     SDP Misc. Capabilities Negotiation          July 2013


   To simplify the construction of SDP records, given the need to
   include fields within the media description in question for endpoints
   that do not support capabilities negotiation, we define some simple
   field-replacement rules for those fields invoked by potential or
   latent configurations.  In particular, any 'i=' or 'c=' line invoked
   by a configuration MUST replace the corresponding line, if present
   within the media description in question.  Any 'b=' line invoked by a
   configuration MUST replace any 'b=' of the same bandwidth type at the
   media level, but not at the session level.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document provides an extension on top of RFC 4566 [RFC4566], RFC
   3264 [RFC3264], SDP Capability Negotiation Framework [RFC5939], and
   SDP Media Capabilities Negotiation [RFC6871].  As such, the security
   considerations of those documents apply.

   The bandwidth capability attribute may be used for reserving
   resources at endpoints and intermediaries which inspect the SDP.
   Modification of the bandwidth value by an attacker can lead to the
   network being underutilized (too high bandwidth value) or congested
   (too low bandwidth value).

   Similarly, by modifying the alternative connection address(es), an
   attacker would be able direct media streams to a desired endpoint,
   thus launching a version of the well known voice hammer attack (see
   Section 18.5.1 of [RFC5245].

   The title capability provides for alternative "i=" line information,
   which is intended for human consumption.  However, manipulating the
   textual information could be misused to provide false information,
   leading to bad user experience or the person using the service making
   wrong the choice regarding the available media streams.

   In case it is essential to protect the capability attribute values,
   one of the security mechanisms proposed in [RFC5939] SHOULD be used.

   The 'i=' line and thus the value carried in the title capability
   attribute is intended for human-readable description only.  It should
   not be parsed programmatically.
