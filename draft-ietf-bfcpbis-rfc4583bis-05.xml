  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>As discussed in the BFCP (Binary Floor Control Protocol) specification <xref target="I-D.ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis"/>, a given BFCP client needs a set of data in order to establish a BFCP connection to a floor control server. These data include the transport address of the server, the conference identifier, and the user identifier.</t>
    <t>One way for clients to obtain this information is to use an offer/answer <xref target="RFC3264"/> exchange. This document specifies how to encode this information in the SDP session descriptions that are part of such an offer/answer exchange.</t>
    <t>User agents typically use the offer/answer model to establish a number of media streams of different types. Following this model, a BFCP connection is described as any other media stream by using an SDP 'm' line, possibly followed by a number of attributes encoded in 'a' lines.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Terminology" anchor="sec:terminology">
    <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref> and indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Fields in the 'm' Line" anchor="sec-m-line">
    <t>This section describes how to generate an 'm' line for a BFCP stream.</t>
    <t>According to the SDP specification <xref target="RFC4566"/>, the 'm' line format is the following:</t>
    <t><list style="hanging">
        <t><![CDATA[m=<media> <port> <transport> <fmt> ...]]></t>
    </list></t>
    <t>The media field MUST have a value of "application".</t>
    <t>The port field is set depending on the value of the transport field, as explained below.  A port field value of zero has the standard SDP meaning (i.e., rejection of the media stream) regardless of the transport used.</t>
    <t><list style="hanging">
        <t>When TCP is used as the transport, the port field is set following the rules in <xref target="RFC4145"/>. Depending on the value of the 'setup' attribute (discussed in <xref target="sec-tcp-connection"/>), the port field contains the port to which the remote endpoint will direct BFCP messages or is irrelevant (i.e., the endpoint will initiate the connection towards the remote endpoint) and should be set to a value of 9, which is the discard port.</t>
        <t>When UDP is used as the transport, the port field contains the port to which the remote endpoint will direct BFCP messages regardless of the value of the 'setup' attribute.</t>
    </list></t>
    <t>We define four new values for the transport field: TCP/BFCP, TCP/TLS/BFCP, UDP/BFCP, and UDP/TLS/BFCP. TCP/BFCP is used when BFCP runs directly on top of TCP, TCP/TLS/BFCP is used when BFCP runs on top of TLS, which in turn runs on top of TCP. Similarly, UDP/BFCP is used when BFCP runs directly on top of UDP, and UDP/TLS/BFCP is used when BFCP runs on top of DTLS <xref target="RFC6347"/>, which in turn runs on top of UDP.</t>
    <t>The fmt (format) list is ignored for BFCP. The fmt list of BFCP 'm' lines SHOULD contain a single "*" character.</t>
    <t>The following is an example of an 'm' line for a BFCP connection:</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Floor Control Server Determination" anchor="sec:server-determination">
    <t>When two endpoints establish a BFCP stream, they need to determine which of them acts as a floor control server. In the most common scenario, a client establishes a BFCP stream with a conference server that acts as the floor control server. Floor control server determination is straight forward because one endpoint can only act as a client and the other can only act as a floor control server.</t>
    <t>However, there are scenarios where both endpoints could act as a floor control server. For example, in a two-party session that involves an audio stream and a shared whiteboard, the endpoints need to decide which party will be acting as the floor control server.</t>
    <t>Furthermore, there are situations where both the offerer and the answerer act as both clients and floor control servers in the same session. For example, in a two-party session that involves an audio stream and a shared whiteboard, one party acts as the floor control server for the audio stream and the other acts as the floor control server for the shared whiteboard.</t>
    <t>We define the 'floorctrl' SDP media-level attribute to perform floor control determination. Its Augmented BNF syntax <xref target="RFC5234"/> is:</t>
    <figure>
      <artwork type='abnf'>
floor-control-attribute  = "a=floorctrl:" role *(SP role)
role                     = "c-only" / "s-only" / "c-s"
      </artwork>
    </figure>

    <t>The offerer includes this attribute to state all the roles it would be willing to perform:</t>
    <t><list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="c-only:">The offerer would be willing to act as a floor control client only.</t>
        <t hangText="s-only:">The offerer would be willing to act as a floor control server only.</t>
        <t hangText="c-s:">The offerer would be willing to act both as a floor control client and as a floor control server.</t>
    </list></t>
    <t>If an SDP media description in an offer contains a 'floorctrl' attribute, the answerer accepting that media MUST include one in the corresponding media description of the answer. The answerer includes this attribute to state which role the answerer will perform. That is, the answerer chooses one of the roles the offerer is willing to perform and generates an answer with the corresponding role for the answerer. <xref target="tab-roles"/> shows the corresponding roles for an answerer, depending on the offerer's role.</t>

    <texttable title="Roles" anchor="tab-roles">
      <ttcol align="center">Offerer</ttcol>
      <ttcol align="center">Answerer</ttcol>

      <c>c-only</c>
      <c>s-only</c>

      <c>s-only</c>
      <c>c-only</c>

      <c>c-s</c>
      <c>c-s</c>
    </texttable>

    <t>The following are the descriptions of the roles when they are chosen by an answerer:</t>
    <t><list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="c-only:">The answerer will act as a floor control client. Consequently, the offerer will act as a floor control server.</t>
        <t hangText="s-only:">The answerer will act as a floor control server. Consequently, the offerer will act as a floor control client.</t>
        <t hangText="c-s:">The answerer will act both as a floor control client and as a floor control server. Consequently, the offerer will also act both as a floor control client and as a floor control server.</t>
    </list></t>
    <t>Endpoints that use the offer/answer model to establish BFCP connections MUST support the 'floorctrl' attribute. A floor control server acting as an offerer or as an answerer SHOULD include this attribute in its session descriptions.</t>
    <t>If the 'floorctrl' attribute is not used in an offer/answer exchange, by default the offerer and the answerer will act as a floor control client and as a floor control server, respectively.</t>
    <t>The following is an example of a 'floorctrl' attribute in an offer. When this attribute appears in an answer, it only carries one role:</t>

   a=floorctrl:c-only s-only c-s
      </artwork>
    </figure>
  </section>

  <section title="The 'confid' and 'userid' SDP Attributes" anchor="sec-sdp-params">
    <t>We define the 'confid' and the 'userid' SDP media-level attributes. These attributes are used by a floor control server to provide a client with a conference ID and a user ID, respectively. Their Augmented BNF syntax <xref target="RFC5234"/> is:</t>
    <figure>
      <artwork type='abnf'>
confid-attribute      = "a=confid:" conference-id
conference-id         = token
userid-attribute      = "a=userid:" user-id
user-id               = token
      </artwork>
    </figure>
    <t>The 'confid' and the 'userid' attributes carry the decimal integer representation of a conference ID and a user ID, respectively.</t>
    <t>Endpoints that use the offer/answer model to establish BFCP connections MUST support the 'confid' and the 'userid' attributes. A floor control server acting as an offerer or as an answerer SHOULD include these attributes in its session descriptions.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Association between Streams and Floors" anchor="sec-association">
    <t>We define the 'floorid' SDP media-level attribute. Its Augmented BNF syntax <xref target="RFC5234"/> is:</t>
    <figure>
      <artwork type='abnf'>
floor-id-attribute = "a=floorid:" token [" mstrm:" token *(SP token)]
      </artwork>
    </figure>
    <t>The 'floorid' attribute is used in the SDP media description for BFCP media. It defines a floor identifier and, possibly, associates it with one or more media streams. The token representing the floor ID is the integer representation of the Floor ID to be used in BFCP. The token representing the media stream is a pointer to the media stream, which is identified by an SDP label attribute <xref target="RFC4574"/>.</t>
    <t>Endpoints that use the offer/answer model to establish BFCP connections MUST support the 'floorid' and the 'label' attributes. A floor control server acting as an offerer or as an answerer SHOULD include these attributes in its session descriptions.</t>
    <t>Note: In <xref target="RFC4583"/> 'm-stream' was erroneously used in <xref target="sec-example"/>. Although the example was non-normative, it is implemented by some vendors and occurs in cases where the endpoint is willing to act as an server. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to support parsing and interpreting 'm-stream' the same way as 'mstrm' when receiving.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="BFCP Connection Management" anchor="sec-bfcp-connection">
    <t>BFCP connections may use TCP or UDP as the underlying transport. BFCP entities exchanging BFCP messages over UDP will direct the BFCP messages to the peer side connection address and port provided in the SDP 'm' line. TCP connection management is more complicated and is described below.</t>
    <section title="TCP Connection Management" anchor="sec-tcp-connection">
      <t>The management of the TCP connection used to transport BFCP is performed using the 'setup' and 'connection' attributes, as defined in <xref target="RFC4145"/>.</t>
      <t>The 'setup' attribute indicates which of the endpoints (client or floor control server) initiates the TCP connection. The 'connection' attribute handles TCP connection reestablishment.</t>
      <t>The BFCP specification <xref target="I-D.ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis"/> describes a number of situations when the TCP connection between a client and the floor control server needs to be reestablished. However, that specification does not describe the reestablishment process because this process depends on how the connection was established in the first place. BFCP entities using the offer/answer model follow the following rules.</t>
      <t>When the existing TCP connection is reset following the rules in <xref target="I-D.ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis"/>, the client SHOULD generate an offer towards the floor control server in order to reestablish the connection. If a TCP connection cannot deliver a BFCP message and times out, the entity that attempted to send the message (i.e., the one that detected the TCP timeout) SHOULD generate an offer in order to reestablish the TCP connection.</t>
      <t>Endpoints that use the offer/answer model to establish TCP connections MUST support the 'setup' and 'connection' attributes.</t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="Authentication" anchor="sec-authentication">
    <t>When a BFCP connection is established using the offer/answer model, it is assumed that the offerer and the answerer authenticate each other using some mechanism. Once this mutual authentication takes place, all the offerer and the answerer need to ensure is that the entity they are receiving BFCP messages from is the same as the one that generated the previous offer or answer.</t>
    <t>When SIP is used to perform an offer/answer exchange, the initial mutual authentication takes place at the SIP level. Additionally, SIP uses S/MIME <xref target="RFC5750"/> to provide an integrity-protected channel with optional confidentiality for the offer/answer exchange. BFCP takes advantage of this integrity-protected offer/answer exchange to perform authentication. Within the offer/answer exchange, the offerer and answerer exchange the fingerprints of their self-signed certificates. These self-signed certificates are then used to establish the TLS/DTLS connection that will carry BFCP traffic between the offerer and the answerer.</t>
    <t>BFCP clients and floor control servers follow the rules in <xref target="RFC4572"/> regarding certificate choice and presentation. This implies that unless a 'fingerprint' attribute is included in the session description, the certificate provided at the TLS-/DTLS-level MUST either be directly signed by one of the other party's trust anchors or be validated using a certification path that terminates at one of the other party's trust anchors <xref target="RFC5280"/>. Endpoints that use the offer/answer model to establish BFCP connections MUST support the 'fingerprint' attribute and SHOULD include it in their session descriptions.</t>
    <t>When TLS is used with TCP, once the underlying connection is established, the answerer acts as the TLS server regardless of its role (passive or active) in the TCP establishment procedure.</t>
    <t>Endpoints that use the offer/answer model to establish a DTLS association MUST support the 'setup' attribute, as defined in <xref target="RFC4145"/>. When DTLS is used with UDP, the 'setup' attribute indicates which of the endpoints (client or floor control server) initiates the DTLS association setup. The requirements for the offer/answer exchange specified in <xref target="RFC5763"/>, Section 5 MUST be followed when using DTLS.</t>
    <t><list style="empty">
        <t>Informational note: How to determine which endpoint to initiate the TLS/DTLS association depends on the selected underlying transport. It was decided to keep the original semantics in <xref target="RFC4583"/> for TCP to retain backwards compatibility. When using UDP, the procedure above was preferred since it adheres to <xref target="RFC5763"/> as used for DTLS-SRTP, it does not overload offer/answer semantics, and it works for offerless INVITE in scenarios with B2BUAs.</t>
    </list></t>

  <section title="Examples" anchor="sec-example">
    <t>For the purpose of brevity, the main portion of the session description is omitted in the examples, which only show 'm' lines and their attributes.</t>
    <t>The following is an example of an offer sent by a conference server to a client.</t>

    </figure>
    <t>Note that due to RFC formatting conventions, this document splits SDP across lines whose content would exceed 72 characters. A backslash character marks where this line folding has taken place. This backslash and its trailing CRLF and whitespace would not appear in actual SDP content.</t>
    <t>The following is the answer returned by the client.</t>

    <t>The BFCP <xref target="I-D.ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis"/>, SDP <xref target="RFC4566"/>, and offer/answer <xref target="RFC3264"/> specifications discuss security issues related to BFCP, SDP, and offer/answer, respectively. In addition, <xref target="RFC4145"/> and <xref target="RFC4572"/> discuss security issues related to the establishment of TCP and TLS connections using an offer/answer model.

    <t>Main purpose of this work was to add signaling support necessary to support BFCP over unreliable transport, as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis"/>, resulting in the following changes:</t>
    <t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
        <t hangText="Fields in the 'm' Line">(<xref target="sec-m-line"/>):<vspace/>
          The section is re-written to remove reference to the exclusivity of TCP as a transport for BFCP streams. The transport field values UDP/BFCP and UDP/TLS/BFCP added.</t>
        <t hangText="Authentication">(<xref target="sec-authentication"/>):<vspace/>
          In last paragraph, made clear that a TCP connection was described.</t>
        <t hangText="Security Considerations">(<xref target="sec:security"/>):<vspace/>
          For the DTLS over UDP case, mention existing considerations and requirements for the offer/answer exchange in <xref target="RFC5763"/>.</t>
        <t hangText="Registration of SDP 'proto' Values">(<xref target="sec:proto-reg"/>):<vspace/>
          Register the two new values UDP/BFCP and UDP/TLS/BFCP in the SDP parameters registry.</t>
    </list></t>
    <t>The clarification and bug fixes:</t>
    <t><list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="Errata ID: 712">(<xref target="sec:server-determination"/> and <xref target="sec-association"/>):<vspace/>
          Language clarification. Don't use terms like an SDP attribute is "used in an 'm' line", instead make clear that the attribute is a media-level attribute.</t>
        <t hangText="Fix typo in example">(<xref target="sec-example"/>):<vspace/>
          Do not use 'm-stream' in the SDP example, use the correct 'mstrm' as specified in <xref target="sec-example"/>. Recommend interpreting 'm-stream' if it is received, since it is present in some implementations.</t>
    </list></t>
