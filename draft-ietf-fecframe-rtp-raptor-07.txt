Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for Raptor        February 2012


1.  Introduction

   The FEC Framework [RFC6363] defines a general framework for the use
   of Forward Error Correction in association with arbitrary packet
   flows, including flows over UDP and RTP [RFC3550].  Forward Error
   Correction operates by generating redundant data packets ("repair
   data") which can be sent independently from the original flow.  At a
   receiver the original flow can be reconstructed provided a sufficient
   set of redundant data packets and possibly original data packets are
   received.

   The FEC Framework provides for independence between application
   protocols and FEC codes.  The use of a particular FEC code within the
   framework is defined by means of a FEC Scheme which may then be used
   with any application protocol compliant to the framework.

   Repair data flows may be sent directly over a transport protocol such
   as UDP, or they may be encapsulated within specialized transports for
   multimedia, such as RTP.

   This document defines the RTP Payload Format for the Raptor FEC
   Schemes defined in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor].

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for Raptor        February 2012


3.  Media Format Background

   The Raptor and RaptorQ codes are efficient block-based fountain
   codes, meaning that from any group of source packets (or 'source
   block') one can generate an arbitrary number of repair packets.  The
   Raptor and RaptorQ codes have the property that the original group of
   source symbols can be recovered with very high probability from any
   set of symbols (source and repair) only slightly greater in number
   than the original number of source symbols.  The RaptorQ code
   additionally has the property that the probability that the original
   group of source symbols can be recovered from a set of symbols
   (source and repair) equal in number to the original number of source
   symbols is in many cases also very high.

   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor] defines six FEC Schemes for the use of the
   Raptor and RaptorQ codes with arbitrary packet flows: the first two
   schemes are fully applicable to arbitrary packet flows (using Raptor
   and RaptorQ respectively).  The third and fourth schemes are slightly
   optimised versions of the first two schemes which are applicable in
   applications with relatively small block sizes.  The fifth and sixth
   schemes are variants of the third and fourth schemes which are
   applicable to a single source flow which already has some kind of
   identifiable sequence number.  The presence of a sequence number in
   the source flow allows for backwards-compatible operation (the source
   flows do not need to be modified in order to apply FEC).  In this
   case, in the language of the FEC Framework, there is no need for an
   explicit FEC Source Payload Id and it is therefore not included in
   the packets.

   This document specifies the payload format for RTP repair flows and
   can be used with any of the FEC Schemes defined in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor].

4.  Payload Format

4.1.  RTP Header Usage

   Header fields SHALL be set according to the rules of [RFC3550].  In
   addition, the following rules and definitions apply for the RTP
   header used with FEC repair packets:

   o  Marker bit: The marker bit SHALL be set to 1 for the last
      protection RTP packet sent for each source block, and otherwise
      set to 0.

   o  Payload Type (PT): The payload type codes SHALL be assigned
      dynamically through non-RTP means.  If SDP is used for signaling,
      the the rules in Section 7 apply.

   o  Timestamp: This field contains the time at which the packet is
      transmitted.  The time SHOULD be as close as possible to the
      packet's actual time of transmission.  The timestamp value has no
      use in the actual FEC protection process.  However,
      implementations SHOULD supply a value that can be used for packet
      arrival timing or jitter calculations.  The timestamp rate is
      specified using the "rate" media type parameter defined in
      Section 6.  The operator SHALL select a 'rate' larger than 1000 Hz
      to provide sufficient resolution to RTCP operations and the
      operator SHOULD select the rate that matches the rate of the
      protected source RTP stream.

   o  SSRC: The SSRC values MUST be set according to [RFC3550].  The
      SSRC value of the RTP repair flow MUST be different from the SSRC
      value of the protected source flow.

4.2.  Payload Header

   There is no Payload Header in this Payload Format.

4.3.  Payload Data

   Procedures and data formats for the use of Raptor Forward Error
   Correction in a FECFRAME context are fully defined in [RFC6363] and
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor] and are not duplicated here.  The
   procedures of those documents apply in order to generate repair data
   streams to be carried by the payload formats defined in this
   document.

   The RTP Payload SHALL contain a FEC Repair Payload as defined in
   [RFC6363] and [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor].

7.  Mapping to SDP

   Applications that are using RTP transport commonly use Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] to describe their RTP sessions.
   The information that is used to specify the media types in an RTP
   session has specific mappings to the fields in an SDP description.
   Note that if an application does not use SDP to describe the RTP
   sessions, an appropriate mapping must be defined and used to specify
   the media types and their parameters for the control/description

   The mapping of the above defined payload format media type and its

8.  Offer/Answer considerations

   When offering Raptor FEC over RTP using SDP in an Offer/Answer model
   [RFC3264], the following considerations apply:

   o  Each combination of the Kmax and T parameters produces different
      FEC data and is not compatible with any other combination.  A
      sender application MAY desire to offer multiple offers with
      different sets of Kmax and T values as long as the parameter
      values are valid.  The receiver SHOULD normally choose the offer
      with the largest value of the product of Kmax and T that it
      supports.

   o  The size of the repair-window is related to the maximum delay
      between the transmission of a source packet and the associated
      repair packet.  This directly impacts the buffering requirement on
      the receiver side and the receiver must consider this when
      choosing an offer.

   o  When the P parameter is not present, the receiver MUST use FEC
      Payload ID Format A. In an answer which selects an offer in which
      the P parameter was omitted, the P parameter MUST either be
      omitted, or included with value "A".

9.  Declarative SDP Considerations

   In declarative usage, like SDP in the Real-time Streaming Protocol
   (RTSP) [RFC2326] or the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
   [RFC2974], the following considerations apply:

   o  The payload format configuration parameters are all declarative
      and a participant MUST use the configuration that is provided for
      the session.

   o  More than one configuration MAY be provided (if desired) by
      declaring multiple RTP payload types.  In that case, the receivers
      should choose the repair session that is best for them.

10.  Repair Flow Generation and Recovery Procedures

10.1.  Overview

   This document only specifies the repair flow construction when the
   repair packets are delivered with RTP.  Source packet construction is
   covered in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor].  This section provides an
   overview on how to generate a repair flow including the repair
   packets and on how to reconstruct missing source packets from a set
   of available source and repair packets.  Detailed algorithms for the
   generation of Raptor and RaptorQ symbols are provided in [RFC5053]
   and [RFC6330], respectively.

   As per the FEC Framework document [RFC6363] the FEC Framework
   Configuration Information includes among others the identification of
   the repair flow(s) and the source flow(s).  Methods to convey FEC
   Framework Configuration Information are provided in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-config-signaling].  Specifically, the reader is
   referred to the SDP elements document [RFC6364], which describes the
   usage of 'SDP' encoding format as an example encoding format for FEC
   Framework Configuration Information.

   For the generation of a repair flow

   o  repair packets SHALL be constructed according to Section 10.2, and

   o  RTCP SHALL be used according to Section 10.3.

   For the reconstruction of a source packets of a source RTP session at
   the receiver based on the availability of a source RTP session and an
   repair RTP session the procedures in Section 10.4 may be used.

10.2.  Repair Packet Construction

   The construction of the repair packet is fully specified in
   Section 4.  A repair packet is constructed by the concatenation of

   o  an RTP header as specified in Section 4.1, and

   o  payload data as defined in Section 4.3.

   Repair Packet Construction may make use of the Sender Operation for
   RTP repair flows as specified in see [RFC6363], section 4.2.

10.3.  Usage of RTCP

   RTCP SHALL be used according to [RFC3550].  If the repair RTP session
   is sent in a separate RTP session the two sessions MUST be associated

   using RTCP CNAME.

10.4.  Source Packet Reconstruction

   Source Packet Reconstruction may make use of the Receiver Operation
   for the case of RTP repair flows as specified in [RFC6363], section
   4.3.  Depending on the FEC scheme in use of the ones defined in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor], the appropriate source blocks are formed.
   If enough data for decoding of any or all of the missing source
   payloads in the source block has been received, the respective FEC
   decoding procedures are applied.

   In case the FEC scheme uses Raptor codes as defined in [RFC5053],
   then the Example FEC decoder as specifed in [RFC5053], section 5.5,
   may be used.

   In case the FEC scheme uses RaptorQ codes as defined in [RFC6330],
   then the Example FEC decoder as specified in [RFC6330], section 5.4,
   may be used.

11.  Session Description Protocol (SDP) Example

   This section provides an SDP [RFC4566] example.  Assume we have one
   source video stream (mid:S1) and one FEC repair stream (mid:R1).  The
   'group' attribute and the FEC grouping semantics defined in [RFC5888]
   and [RFC5956], respectively, are used to associate source and repair
   flows.  We form one FEC group with the "a=group:FEC S1 R1" line.  The
   source and repair streams are sent to the same port on different
   multicast groups.  The repair window is set to 200 ms.

12.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests that IANA registers application/raptorfec as
   specified in Section 6.1.1, video/raptorfec as specified in
   Section 6.2.1, audio/raptorfec as specified in Section 6.3.1 and
   text/raptorfec as specified in Section 6.4.1.  The media type is also
   requested to be added to the IANA registry for "RTP Payload Format
   MIME types" (http://www.iana.org/assignments/rtp-parameters).

13.  Security Considerations

   Security Considerations related to the use of the FEC Framework are
   addressed in [RFC6363].  These consideration apply in full to users
   of the RTP Payload Formats defined in this document, since these are
   defined in terms of the FEC Framework.

   No further security considerations related specifically to the Raptor
   FEC Schemes defined in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor] have been
   identified.

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550] and in any applicable RTP profile.  The main
   security considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload
   format defined within this memo are confidentiality, integrity and
   source authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encrypting the
   RTP payload.  Integrity of the RTP packets is achieved through a
   suitable cryptographic integrity protection mechanism.  Such a
   cryptographic system can also allow the authentication of the source
   of the payload.  A suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload
   format should provide confidentiality, integrity protection, and at
   least source authentication capable of determining if an RTP packet
   is from a member of the RTP session.  Note that the appropriate
   mechanism to provide security to RTP and payloads following this memo
   MAY vary.  It is dependent on the application, transport and
   signaling protocol employed.  Therefore, a single mechanism is not
   sufficient, although if suitable, using the Secure Real-time
   Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] is RECOMMENDED.  Other mechanisms
   that may be used are IPsec [RFC4301] and Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) [RFC5246] (RTP over TCP); other alternatives exist.
