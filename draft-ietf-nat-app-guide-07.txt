This document discusses those things that application designers might
wish to consider when designing new protocols.  While many common
Internet applications will operate cleanly in the presence of Network
Address Translators, others suffer from a variety of problems when
crossing these devices.  Guidelines are presented herein to help
ensure new protocols and applications will, to the extent possible, be
compatible with NAT (Network Address Translation).

This document is a product of the Network Address Translators Working
Group of the IETF.
