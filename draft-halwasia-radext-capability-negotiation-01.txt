Internet-Draft      Capability Negotiation in RADIUS        October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) [RFC2865] and
   [RFC2866] is widely used protocol for Authentication, Authorization
   and Accounting.  There are quite a lot of extensions which are being
   done on RADIUS protocol and considering that RADIUS is being deployed
   quite extensively, it would be nice if RADIUS Client and Server can
   negotiate the capability to support those extensions.  This
   specification recommends and envision each proposed capability to be
   as precise and narrowly defined as possible and having said that we
   envision fairly large number of capabilities rather than few broadly
   defined ones.  For example [I-D.ietf-radext-radius-extensions]
   proposes extended attributes space along with few other extensions
   and it would be nice if RADIUS Client and Server can signal and
   negotiate support for 'extended attributes'.  This document describes
   procedure and mechanism to exchange and negotiate capabilities
   between RADIUS client and RADIUS server.

1.1.  Solution Description

   This specification proposes to define two new RADIUS packet types to
   negotiate capabilities between RADIUS client and RADIUS server as
   defined in section 2.  It also proposes to define 3 new attributes to
   be carried inside new RADIUS packet types.  New RADIUS packets to
   negotiate capability has been chosen as it has minimal impact on the
   RADIUS security model and existing implementations.  Following
   sections describes the new RADIUS packet types and attributes and
   describes their usage in negotiating capabilities.  As per this
   specification Capability-Request RADIUS packets MUST NOT be proxied.


2.  RADIUS Packets

   This document defines following new RADIUS packet type to enable
   capability negotiation between RADIUS client and server.

2.1.  Capability-Request RADIUS Packet

     Capability-Request RADIUS Packets are sent to a RADIUS server to
     convey the capabilities RADIUS client intends to add and withdraw.

     A summary of the Capability-Request packet format is shown below.
     The fields are transmitted from left to right.

     Identifier

        The Identifier field MUST be changed whenever the content of the
        Attributes field changes, and whenever a valid reply has been
        received for a previous request.  For retransmissions, the
        Identifier MUST remain unchanged.

     Request Authenticator

        The Request Authenticator value MUST be changed each time a new
        Identifier is used. It is calculated the same way as calculated
        for Access-Request RADIUS Packet as described in section 3 of
        RFC2865.

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    Type

       TBA5 - Capability-Ack

    Length

       6

    Value

       Enumerated Data Type in 4-Octet unsigned integer defined in
       [RFC6158]. This field contains the capability-id as specified
       in section 4 of this document.


4.  RADIUS Capability-Id

   Value field of Capability-Add and Capability-Withdraw attributes
   defined above contains the Capability-Id of the capability RADIUS
   client wants to negotiate with RADIUS server.  This document does not
   define any new capability and it's associated Capability-Id.  Any
   specification which wants to use this mechanism of capability
   negotiation MUST define a new capability.  Each new capability MUST
   be registered with IANA to get a capability-id from capability-id
   registry.


5.  RADIUS Client Behavior

   RADIUS Client willing to negotiate capabilities SHOULD send
   Capability-Request RADIUS Packet (defined in section 2) towards the
   RADIUS Server.  RADIUS Client MUST include Capability-Add Attribute
   in Capability-Request RADIUS Packet for the capability client wants
   to add/negotiate.  Client can also include Capability-Withdraw
   Attribute in the RADIUS packet in case it wants to withdraw the

Internet-Draft      Capability Negotiation in RADIUS        October 2012


   capability it has negotiated earlier.  Client MUST NOT add the
   Capability-Withdraw Attribute in the Capability-Request RADIUS Packet
   in case it has not negotiated the corresponding attribute earlier.
   Client can include multiple Capability-Add and/or Capability-Withdraw
   Attributes in the same Capability-Request RADIUS Packet.  RADIUS
   client MUST add atleast one Capability-Add and/or Capability-Withdraw
   Attribute in Capability-Request RADIUS Packet.  Client MUST NOT
   include the Capability-Add and Capability-Withdraw Attribute for the
   same capability in the same Capability-Request RADIUS Packet.

   Apart from including Capability-Add and/or Capability-Withdraw
   Attributes in the Capability-Request RADIUS Packet, Client can
   include NAS-Identifier [RFC2865] or one of the NAS-IP-
   Address[RFC2865]/NAS-IPv6-Address [RFC3162] for the porpose of RADIUS
   server to identify client.


6.  RADIUS Server Behavior

   RADIUS Server implementing this specification MUST respond back with
   Capability-Response RADIUS Packet after receiving a valid Capability-
   Request RADIUS Packet from the RADIUS Client.  As specified in
   section 5, Client will advertise it's capabilities by including
   Capability-Add and/or Capability-Withdraw Attributes in the same
   Capability-Request RADIUS Packet.  RADIUS Server will find out the
   common set of agreed upon capabilities based upon the intersection in
   between capabilities received from client and it's own capabilities.
   RADIUS Server MUST include a Capability-Ack Attribute for each of the
   agreed upon capabilities in the Capability-Response RADIUS Packet.
   RADIUS Server MUST NOT include Capability-Ack attributes for all
   those capabilities which is does not want to support/share with
   RADIUS Client.  If the RADIUS Server does not support any of the
   capabilities specified in Capability-Request RADIUS Packet, it SHOULD
   send back a empty Capability-Response RADIUS Packet without including
   any Capability-Ack attribute.

   RADIUS Server implementation which does not support capability
   negotiation specified in this specification MUST silently discard
   Capability-Request RADIUS Packet received from RADIUS Client.

   Following example figure shows the sequence of message exchanges
   which happens between RADIUS Client and RADIUS Server to negotiate a

8.  IANA Considerations

   The authors request that Packet Type, Attribute Types and Attribute
   Values defined in this document be registered by by the Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) from the RADIUS namespaces as
   described in the "IANA Considerations" section of RFC 3575 [RFC3575],
   in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC5226].  For RADIUS packets, attributes
   and registries created by this document IANA is requested to place
   them at http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types.

   This document defines the following RADIUS messages:
   -  Capability-Request

   -  Capability-Response

   This document defines the following attributes:
   -  Capability-Add

   -  Capability-Withdraw

   -  Capability-Ack

   Additionally, IANA is requested to create the following new
   registries listed in the subsections below.

8.1.  New Registry: Capability-Identifier

   This document also defines an Capabality-Identifier registry (used in
   the value field of Capability-Add, Capability-Withdraw and
   Capability-Ack Attributes).  IANA is requested to just allocate space



DeKok, et al.            Expires April 11, 2013                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft      Capability Negotiation in RADIUS        October 2012


   for this registry and this document does not request IANA to allocate
   any value from this registry.

   Requests to IANA for a new value for a Capability Identifier will be
   approved by Expert Review.  A designated expert will be appointed by
   the IESG.


9.  Security Considerations

   This document defines new RADIUS message types and new Attribute
   types, but otherwise makes no changes to the security of the RADIUS
   protocol.
