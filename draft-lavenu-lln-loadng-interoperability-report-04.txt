Internet-Draft            LOADng Interop Report            December 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document reports experience with the LOADng [LOADng] routing
   protocol, as obtained by way of a number of interoperability tests
   during the protocol development.

   Interoperability tests between LOADng Routers implemented on the
   basis of the different versions of the protocol have been undertaken
   mainly to:

   o  Show evidence that interoperable LOADng implementations do exist.

   o  Clarify and improve the overall quality of the LOADng
      specification.

   o  Demonstrate that the final LOADng internet draft can be considered
      as a standalone specification allowing the development of
      interoperable implementations of LOADng.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology of [LOADng].

3.  Interoperability Scenarios

   This section describes the various tests and scenarios carried out
   between the implementations involved in the various interoperability
   tests.

   The testbed required is composed of up to five LOADng Routers,
   connected according to the specific topology described for each test
   scenario below.  The LOADng routing protocol was run over UDP and
   IPv4.  Either Ethernet or 802.11 wireless network was used in the
   test.

3.1.  Scenario 01: 1-hop Bidirectional Route Establishment - Forward
      Route and Reverse Route initial installation

   For each implementation, this test aims to verify the initial
   installation of a bidirectional route (Forward Route and Reverse
   Route from A to B) within the LOADng Router routing tables (Routing
   Sets) through the effective generation and processing of LOADng
   control messages (RREQ, RREP, RREP-ACK).

3.1.1.  Scenario Topology

   The testbed is composed of two LOADng Routers:

                         +-------+        +-------+
                         |   A   |________|   B   |
                         |       |        |       |
                         +-------+        +-------+

   This test suite consists in establishing a bidirectional route
   between LOADng Router A and LOADng Router B.

3.1.2.  Expected Message Sequencing

   The expected message sequencing is as follows:

   o  LOADng Router A generates an RREQ message intended for LOADng
      Router B.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router B installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router B to LOADng Router A) and sends an unicast RREP message
      intended for LOADng Router A, soliciting an RREP-ACK message.

   o  Upon receiving the RREP, LOADng Router A installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router B (Forward Route from LOADng
      Router A to LOADng Router B) and sends an unicast RREP-ACK message
      to LOADng Router B.


                           A                   B
                           |     RREQ          |
                           -------------------->
                           |     RREP          |
                           <--------------------
                           |     RREP-ACK      |
                           -------------------->
                           |                   |

3.2.  Scenario 02: 1-hop Bidirectional Route Establishment -Forward
      Route and Reverse Route updating

   For each implementation, this test aims to verify the refreshment of
   a bidirectional route (Forward Route and Reverse Route from A to B)
   already installed within the LOADng Router routing tables (Routing
   Sets) through the effective generation and processing of LOADng
   control messages (RREQ, RREP, RREP-ACK).

3.2.1.  Scenario Topology

   The testbed is composed of two LOADng Routers:

                         |   A   |________|   B   |
                         |       |        |       |
                         +-------+        +-------+

   This test suite consists in updating a bidirectional route between
   LOADng Router A and LOADng Router B.

3.2.2.  Expected Message Sequencing

   The expected message sequencing is as follows:

   o  LOADng Router A generates an RREQ message intended for LOADng
      Router B.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router B updates the corresponding
      route (Reverse Route from LOADng Router B to LOADng Router A)
      already installed within its Routing Set and sends an unicast RREP
      message intended for LOADng Router A, soliciting an RREP-ACK
      message.

   o  Upon receiving the RREP, LOADng Router A updates the corresponding
      route (Forward Route from LOADng Router A to LOADng Router B)
      already installed within its Routing Set and sends an unicast
      RREP-ACK message to LOADng Router B.


                           A                   B
                           |     RREQ          |
                           -------------------->
                           |     RREP          |
                           <--------------------
                           |     RREP-ACK      |
                           -------------------->
                           |                   |

3.3.  Scenario 03: 2-hop bidirectional route establishment - Forward
      Route and Reverse Route initial installation

   This test aims to verify the initial installation of a bidirectional
   route (Forward Route and Reverse Route from A to C) within the LOADng
   Router routing tables (Routing Sets) through the effective forwarding
   of LOADng control traffic by LOADng Router B which is located between
   LOADng Router A and LOADng Router C. It is also verified that RREP-
   ACK messages are not forwarded by the LOADng Routers these messages
   are intended for.

3.3.1.  Scenario Topology

   The testbed is composed of three LOADng Routers.  Control traffic
   generated by either LOADng Router A towards LOADng Router C or LOADng
   Router C towards LOADng Router A has to be forwarded by LOADng Router
   B:

   This test suite consists in establishing a bidirectional route
   between LOADng Router A and LOADng Router C.

3.3.2.  Expected Message Sequencing

   The expected message sequencing is as follows:

   o  LOADng Router A generates an RREQ message intended for LOADng
      Router C.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router B installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router B to LOADng Router A) and forwards the received RREQ.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router C installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router C to LOADng Router A) and a new tuple towards LOADng Router
      B (Reverse route from LOADng Router C to LOADng Router B).  The
      reception of the RREQ also triggers the generation of an unicast
      RREP message intended for LOADng Router A, soliciting an RREP-ACK
      message.

   o  Upon receiving the RREP, LOADng Router B installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router C (Forward Route from LOADng
      Router B to LOADng Router C), sends an unicast RREP-ACK message to
      LOADng Router C and forwards the RREP received previously.

   o  Upon receiving the RREP, LOADng Router A installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router B (Forward Route from LOADng
      Router A to LOADng Router B) and a new tuple towards LOADng Router
      C (Forward Route from LOADng Router A to LOADng Router C).  The
      reception of the RREP also triggers an unicast RREP-ACK message
      intended for LOADng Router B.

3.4.  Scenario 04: 2-hop bidirectional route establishment - Forward
      Route and Reverse Route updating

   This test aims to verify the refreshment of a bidirectional route
   (Forward Route and Reverse Route from A to C) already installed
   within the LOADng Router routing tables (Routing Sets) through the
   effective forwarding of LOADng control traffic by LOADng Router B
   which is located between LOADng Router A and LOADng Router C.

3.4.1.  Scenario Topology

   The testbed is composed of three LOADng Routers.  Control traffic
   generated by either LOADng Router A towards LOADng Router C or LOADng
   Router C towards LOADng Router A has to be forwarded by LOADng Router
   B:

                +-------+        +-------+        +-------+

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router C updates the corresponding
      routes (Reverse Routes from LOADng Router C to LOADng Router A and
      from LOADng Router C to LOADng Router B).  The reception of the

   o  Upon receiving the RREP, LOADng Router B updates the corresponding

      routes (Forward routes from LOADng Router A to LOADng Router B and
      from LOADng Router A to LOADng Router C).  The reception of the

3.5.  Scenario 05: 2-hop bidirectional route establishment - Link
      breakage handling

   This test aims to verify the proper generation and processing of an
   RERR message after an artificially created link breakage on an
   previously established bidirectional route.

3.5.1.  Scenario Topology

   The testbed is composed of three LOADng Routers.  Control traffic
   generated by either LOADng Router A towards LOADng Router C or LOADng

   Router C towards LOADng Router A has to be forwarded by LOADng Router
   B:

                +-------+        +-------+        +-------+
                |   A   |________|   B   |________|   C   |
                |       |        |       |        |       |
                +-------+        +-------+        +-------+

   This test suite consists in handling link breakages between routers.

3.5.2.  Expected Message Sequencing

   The expected message sequencing is as follows:

   o  A bidirectional route is already established between LOADng
      Routers A and C.

   o  At some time, link breakage is detected by LOADng Router B.
      Consequently, an unicast RERR message intended for LOADng Router A
      (here the assumption is made that the unsuccessful delivered data
      traffic would have been generated by LOADng Router A) is
      transmitted.

      Note: link breakage is provoked artificially and its detection by
      LOADng Router B is triggered manually (normally, this would be
      triggered by failure in sending data traffic intended for LOADng
      Router C).

   o  Upon receiving the RERR, LOADng Router A updates its Routing Set
      by invalidating the existing Forward Route from LOADng Router A to
      LOADng Router C.


                 A                   B                   C
                 |                   |                   |
                 |                   | B-C link breakage |
                 |                   |                   X
                 |     RERR          |                   X
                 <--------------------                   X

3.6.  Scenario 06: 3-hop bidirectional route establishment - Forward
      Route and Reverse Route initial installation

   This test aims to verify the initial installation of a bidirectional
   route (Forward Route and Reverse Route from A to D) within the LOADng
   Router routing tables (Routing Sets) through the effective forwarding

   of LOADng control traffic by LOADng Routers B and C, which are
   located between LOADng Router A and LOADng Router D. It is also
   verified that RREP-ACK messages are not forwarded by the LOADng
   Routers these messages are intended for.

3.6.1.  Scenario Topology

   The testbed is composed of four LOADng Routers.  Control traffic
   generated by either LOADng Router A towards LOADng Router D or LOADng
   Router D towards LOADng Router A has to be forwarded by LOADng
   Routers B and C:

        +-------+        +-------+        +-------+        +-------+
        |   A   |________|   B   |________|   C   |________|   D   |

   This test suite consists in establishing a bidirectional route
   between LOADng Router A and LOADng Router D.

3.6.2.  Expected Message Sequencing

   The expected message sequencing is as follows:

   o  LOADng Router A generates an RREQ message intended for LOADng
      Router D.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router B installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router B to LOADng Router A) and forwards the received RREQ.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router C installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router C to LOADng Router A) and a new tuple towards LOADng Router
      B (Reverse route from LOADng Router C to LOADng Router B) and
      forwards the received RREQ.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router D installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router D to LOADng Router A) and a new tuple towards LOADng Router
      C (Reverse route from LOADng Router D to LOADng Router C).  The
      reception of the RREQ also triggers the generation of an unicast
      RREP message intended for LOADng Router A, soliciting an RREP-ACK
      message.

   o  Upon receiving the RREP, LOADng Router C installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router D (Forward Route from LOADng
      Router C to LOADng Router D), sends an unicast RREP-ACK message to

      unicast RREP-ACK message is also sent to LOADng Router C and the
      RREP received previously is forwarded.

   o  Upon receiving the RREP, LOADng Router A installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router B (Forward Route from LOADng
      Router A to LOADng Router B) and a new tuple towards LOADng Router
      D (Forward Route from LOADng Router A to LOADng Router D).  The

3.8.  Scenario 08: 3-hop bidirectional route establishment - Link
      breakage handling

   This test aims to verify the proper generation, processing and
   forwarding of a RERR message after an artificially created link
   breakage on an previously established bidirectional route.

3.8.1.  Scenario Topology

   The testbed is composed of four LOADng Routers.  Control traffic
   generated by either LOADng Router A towards LOADng Router D or LOADng
   Router D towards LOADng Router A has to be forwarded by LOADng
   Routers B and C:

   This test suite consists in handling link breakages between LOADng
   Routers.

3.8.2.  Expected Message Sequencing

   The expected message sequencing is as follows:

   o  A bidirectional route is already established between LOADng
      Routers A and D.

   o  At some time, link breakage is detected by LOADng Router C.
      Consequently, an unicast RERR message intended for LOADng Router A
      (here the assumption is made that the unsuccessful delivered data
      traffic would have been generated by LOADng Router A) is
      transmitted to LOADng Router B according to the Reverse Route from
      LOADng Router C to LOADng Router A computed previously.

      Note: link breakage is provoked artificially and its detection by
      LOADng Router C is triggered manually (normally, this would be
      triggered by failure in sending data traffic intended for LOADng
      Router D).

   o  Upon receiving the RERR, LOADng Router B updates its Routing Set
      by invalidating the existing Forward Route from LOADng Router B to
      LOADng Router D. Afterwards, the RERR message is forwarded
      according to the existing Reverse Route from LOADng Router B to
      LOADng Router A.

   o  Upon receiving the RERR, LOADng Router A updates its Routing Set
      by invalidating the existing Forward Route from LOADng Router A to
      LOADng Router D.

   This test aims to verify the initial installation of a bidirectional
   route (Forward Route and Reverse Route from A to E) within the LOADng

   Router routing tables (Routing Sets) through the effective forwarding
   of LOADng control traffic by LOADng Routers B, C and D, which are
   located between LOADng Router A and LOADng Router E. It is also
   verified that RREP-ACK messages are not forwarded by the LOADng
   Routers these messages are intended for.

3.9.1.  Scenario Topology

   The testbed is composed of five LOADng Routers.  Control traffic
   generated by either LOADng Router A towards LOADng Router E or LOADng
   Router E towards LOADng Router A has to be forwarded by LOADng
   Routers B, C and D:

   |   A   |______|   B   |______|   C   |______|   D   |______|   E   |

   +-------+      +-------+      +-------+      +-------+      +-------+

   This test suite consists in establishing a bidirectional route
   between LOADng Router A and LOADng Router E.

3.9.2.  Expected Message Sequencing

   The expected message sequencing is as follows:

   o  LOADng Router A generates an RREQ message intended for LOADng
      Router E.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router B installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router B to LOADng Router A) and forwards the received RREQ.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router C installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router C to LOADng Router A) and a new tuple towards LOADng Router
      B (Reverse route from LOADng Router C to LOADng Router B) and
      forwards the received RREQ.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router D installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router D to LOADng Router A) and a new tuple towards LOADng Router
      C (Reverse route from LOADng Router D to LOADng Router C) and
      forwards the received RREQ.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router E installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router E to LOADng Router A) and a new tuple towards LOADng Router
      D (Reverse route from LOADng Router E to LOADng Router D).  The

      reception of the RREQ also triggers the generation of an unicast
      RREP message intended for LOADng Router A, soliciting an RREP-ACK
      message.

   o  Upon receiving the RREP, LOADng Router D installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router E (Forward Route from LOADng
      Router D to LOADng Router E), sends an unicast RREP-ACK message to
      LOADng Router E and forwards the RREP received previously.

   o  Upon receiving the RREP, LOADng Router C installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router E (Forward Route from LOADng
      Router C to LOADng Router E) and a new tuple towards LOADng Router
      D (Forward Route from LOADng Router C to LOADng Router D).  An
      unicast RREP-ACK message is also sent to LOADng Router D and the
      RREP received previously is forwarded.

   o  Upon receiving the RREP, LOADng Router B installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router E (Forward Route from LOADng
      Router B to LOADng Router E) and a new tuple towards LOADng Router
      C (Forward Route from LOADng Router B to LOADng Router C).  An
      unicast RREP-ACK message is also sent to LOADng Router C and the
      RREP received previously is forwarded.

   o  Upon receiving the RREP, LOADng Router A installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router B (Forward Route from LOADng
      Router A to LOADng Router B) and a new tuple towards LOADng Router
      E (Forward Route from LOADng Router A to LOADng Router E).  The
      reception of the RREP also triggers an unicast RREP-ACK message
      intended for LOADng Router B.

3.10.2.  Expected Message Sequencing

   The expected message sequencing is as follows:

   o  A bidirectional route is already established between LOADng
      Routers A and E.

   o  At some time, a link breakage to E is detected by LOADng Router D.
      Consequently, an unicast RERR message intended for LOADng Router A
      (here the assumption is made that the unsuccessful delivered data

3.11.  Scenario 11: Establishment of the best bidirectional route

   This test aims to verify the processing of multiple RREQs when
   installing a bidirectional route (Forward Route and Reverse Route
   from A to C) within the LOADng Router routing tables (Routing Sets).

3.11.1.  Scenario Topology

   The testbed is composed of three LOADng Routers.  Control traffic
   generated by either LOADng Router A towards LOADng Router C or LOADng
   Router C towards LOADng Router A can be forwarded by LOADng Router B
   or transmitted via the direct link between LOADng Routers A and C:

                +-------+        +-------+        +-------+
                |   A   |________|   B   |________|   C   |
                |       |        |       |        |       |
                +-------+        +-------+        +-------+
                    |_________________________________|

   This test consists in establishing a bidirectional route between
   LOADng Router A and LOADng Router C. Hop count metric is used for
   measuring differet routes.

3.11.2.  Expected Message Sequencing

   The expected message sequencing is as follows:

   o  LOADng Router A generates an RREQ message intended for LOADng
      Router C. According to RREQ transmission rules, the generated RREQ
      message is transmitted to all neighbor LOADng Routers.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router B installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router B to LOADng Router A) and forwards the received RREQ.

      At the same time, upon receiving the same RREQ via its direct link
      with LOADng Router A, LOADng Router C installs a new tuple in its
      Routing Set (Reverse Route from LOADng Router C to LOADng Router
      A).  The reception of the RREQ also triggers the generation of an
      unicast RREP message intended for LOADng Router A, requiring RREP-
      ACK message.

   o  Upon receiving the same RREQ via LOADng Router B, LOADng Router C
      compares the RREQ.route-metric information carried by the RREQ
      with the already existing tuple within its Routing Set (Reverse
      Route from LOADng Router C to LOADng Router A) according to the
      comparison operator specified by the metric used (the "hop count"
      metric was used).  Thus, the best route is chosen considering only

Internet-Draft            LOADng Interop Report            December 2012


      the hop count:

     Already existing tuple:

             <R_hop_count> = 1

     Tuple corresponding to the newly received RREQ:

             <R_hop_count> = 2

     According to the comparison operator specified by the metric used:

             1 < 2

      Consequently, the newly received RREQ message is discarded without
      affecting the Routing Set or triggering the generation of any RREP
      message.

   o  Upon receiving the RREP via its direct link with LOADng Router C,
      LOADng Router A installs a new tuple in its Routing Set (Forward
      Route from LOADng Router A to LOADng Router C).  The reception of
      the RREP also triggers an unicast RREP-ACK message intended for

   Note: the RREQ forwarded by LOADng Router B towards C is not
   necessarily received before LOADng Router C generates the RREP
   message intended for LOADng Router A. Indeed, the order in which
   those messages are transmitted is dependent on the transmission
   delays of each single link between LOADng Routers A, B and C.

3.12.  Scenario 12: Blacklisting

   This test aims to verify the effectiveness of avoiding unidirectional
   links using blacklisting.

3.12.1.  Scenario Topology

   The testbed is composed of four LOADng Routers with a unidirectional
   link between LOADng Routers A and D (direct communication from D
   towards A is impossible).

   This test consists in establishing a bidirectional route between
   LOADng Router A and LOADng Router D.

3.12.2.  Expected Message Sequencing

   First attempt to establish a bidirectional route between LOADng
   Routers A and D:

   o  LOADng Router A generates an RREQ message (RREQ.seq-num = 0,
      RREQ.originator = A) intended for LOADng Router D.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router B installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router B to LOADng Router A) and forwards the received RREQ.

      At the same time, upon receiving the same RREQ via its direct
      (unidirectional) link with LOADng Router A, LOADng Router D
      installs a new tuple in its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A
      (Reverse Route from LOADng Router D to LOADng Router A).  The
      reception of the RREQ also triggers the generation of an unicast
      RREP message intended for LOADng Router A. The RREP.ackrequired
      the sent RREP message is set ('1').

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router C installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router C to LOADng Router A) and a new tuple towards LOADng Router
      B (Reverse route from LOADng Router C to LOADng Router B) and
      forwards the received RREQ.

   o  Upon receiving the same RREQ (RREQ.seq-num = 0, RREQ.originator =
      A) again via LOADng Router C, LOADng Router D compares the

Internet-Draft            LOADng Interop Report            December 2012


      RREQ.route-metric information carried by the RREQ with the already
      existing tuple within its Routing Set (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router D to LOADng Router A) according to the comparison operator
      specified by the metric used (hop count):

     Already existing tuple:

             <R_hop_count> = 1

     Tuple corresponding to the newly received RREQ:

             <R_hop_count> = 2

     According to the comparison operator specified by the metric used:

             1 < 2

      Consequently, the newly received RREQ message is discarded without
      affecting the Routing Set or triggering the generation of any RREP
      message.

   o  Due to the unidirectional nature of the existing link between
      LOADng Routers A and D, the RREP message previously sent by LOADng
      Router D intended for LOADng Router A did not reach its
      destination.  After an elapsed time equaling RREP_ACK_TIMEOUT,
      LOADng Router D is not expecting an RREP-ACK message anymore.
      This results in recording LOADng Router A neighbor in LOADng
      Router D's Blacklist.

   Second attempt to establish a bidirectional route between LOADng
   Routers A and D:

   o  LOADng Router A generates an RREQ message (RREQ.seq-num = 1,
      RREQ.originator = A) intended for LOADng Router D.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router B installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router A (Reverse Route from LOADng
      Router B to LOADng Router A) and forwards the received RREQ.

      At the same time, upon receiving the same RREQ via its blacklisted
      neighbor LOADng Router A, LOADng Router D discards the message.

   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router C updates the corresponding
      routes (Reverse Routes from LOADng Router C to LOADng Router A and
      from LOADng Router C to LOADng Router B) and forwards the received
      RREQ.

Internet-Draft            LOADng Interop Report            December 2012


   o  Upon receiving the RREQ, LOADng Router D updates the already
      installed route (Reverse Route from LOADng Router C to LOADng
      Router A) and installs a new tuple towards LOADng Router C
      (Reverse route from LOADng Router D to LOADng Router C).  The
      reception of the RREQ also triggers the generation of an unicast
      RREP message intended for LOADng Router A. The RREP.ackrequired of
      the sent RREP message is set ('1').

   o  Upon receiving the RREP, LOADng Router C installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router D (Forward Route from LOADng
      Router C to LOADng Router D), sends an unicast RREP-ACK message to
      LOADng Router D and forwards the RREP received previously.

   o  Upon receiving the RREP, LOADng Router B installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router D (Forward Route from LOADng
      Router B to LOADng Router D) and a new tuple towards LOADng Router
      C (Forward Route from LOADng Router B to LOADng Router C).  An
      unicast RREP-ACK message is also sent to LOADng Router C and the
      RREP received previously is forwarded.

   o  Upon receiving the RREP, LOADng Router A installs a new tuple in
      its Routing Set towards LOADng Router D (Forward Route from LOADng
      Router A to LOADng Router D) and a new tuple towards LOADng Router
      B (Forward Route from LOADng Router A to LOADng Router B).  The
      reception of the RREP also triggers an unicast RREP-ACK message
      intended for LOADng Router B.

4.2.  Place and Date of Interoperability Test

   This section reports experience with the LOADng routing protocol,
   resulting from interoperability testing performed at Hitachi YRL in
   Yokohama, Japan, from october 17th to october 19th 2011.

4.3.  Participating Implementations

   The following implementations were used to perform the
   interoperability tests this section, listed alphabetically:

   Ecole Polytechnique: "LIX" -  This implementation was jointly
      developed by Axel Colin de Verdiere, Jiazi Yi, Ulrich Herberg and
      Thomas Clausen of Ecole Ploytechnique's networking team.  It
      consists of approximately 6000 lines of JAVA code running in a Mac
      OS environment.  It supports RREQ, RREP, RREP-ACK and RERR
      generation, processing, forwarding and transmission.

   Hitachi YRL 1: "Hitachi 1" -  This implementation was fully developed
      by Yuichi Igarashi of Hitachi YRL.  It consists of 1589 lines of C
      code running in the Hitachi proprietary micro OS environment
      embedded in a 16MHz H8 micro processor.  It supports RREQ, RREP,
      RREP-ACK and RERR generation, processing, forwarding and
      transmission.

   Hitachi YRL 2: "Hitachi 2" -  This implementation was jointly
      developed by Nobukatsu Inomata of Hitachi ULSI Systems and Yoko
      Morii of Hitachi YRL.  It consists of 1987 lines of C++ code
      running in a Mac OS environment.  It supports RREQ, RREP, RREP-ACK
      generation, processing, forwarding and transmission, and RERR
      processing.

4.4.  Scenarios Tested

   This interoperability test includes all scenarios 01-12 (inclusive).

4.5.  Additional Interoperability Test Considerations

   Wireshark packet sniffers, modified to interpret LOADng control
   traffic, were used to monitor each link, so as to verify propper
   message sequencing.

   For each test, the initiation of the communication resulting in the
   generation of the first LOADng control traffic message is always
   triggered manually.  In addition, RREP-ACK LOADng control messages
   were systematically expected from each LOADng Router upon reception
   of a RREP LOADng control message in order to allow the detection of
   unidirectional links.

4.18.  Conclusions

   The different test scenarios carried that were carried out for
   different interoperable and independent implementations allowed to
   completely cover the [LOADng-00] specification by checking each
   technical feature one by one.  In addition, the completion of this
   process permitted the improvement of the overall quality and accuracy
   of the [LOADng-00] specification.

   generation of the first LOADng control traffic message is always
   triggered manually.  In addition, RREP-ACK LOADng control messages
   were systematically expected from each LOADng Router upon reception
   of a RREP LOADng control message in order to allow the detection of
   unidirectional links.

6.11.  Conclusions

   The different test scenarios that were carried out for different
   interoperable and independent implementations allowed to cover all
   major features of the LOADng specification by checking each technical
   feature one by one.  In addition, the completion of this process
   permitted the improvement of the overall quality and accuracy of the
   [LOADng] specification.

7.  Interop 04: Vancouver, Canada, August, 2011

7.1.  Version of LOADng Specifiation Tested

   The interoperability tests were conducted according to the
   specification in [LOADng-05].

7.2.  Place and Date of Interoperability Test

   This section reports experience with the LOADng routing protocol,
   resulting from interoperability testing performed at Hyatt Hotel,
   Vancouver, August 2nd, 2012.

7.3.  Participating Implementations

   The following implementations were used to perform the
   interoperability tests this section, listed alphabetically:

   Ecole Polytechnique: "LIX" -  This implementation was jointly
      developed by Axel Colin de Verdiere, Jiazi Yi, Ulrich Herberg and
      Thomas Clausen of Ecole Ploytechnique's networking team.  It
      consists of approximately 6000 lines of JAVA code running in a Mac
      OS environment.  It supports RREQ, RREP, RREP-ACK and RERR
      generation, processing, forwarding and transmission.

   Fujitsu Laboratories of America: "FLA" -  This implementation was
      developed by Ulrich Herberg from Fujitsu Laboratories of America.
      It is a Java implementation, supporting all LOADng features (RREQ,
      RREP, RREP-ACK generation, processing, forwarding and
      transmission).

7.4.  Scenarios Tested

   This interoperability test includes scenarios 01-05 (inclusive).

7.5.  Additional Interoperability Test Considerations

   For each test, the initiation of the communication resulting in the
   generation of the first LOADng control traffic message is always
   triggered manually.  In addition, RREP-ACK LOADng control messages
   were systematically expected from each LOADng Router upon reception
   of an RREP LOADng control message in order to allow the detection of
   unidirectional links.

   In this interop event, the use of different metrics types in the
   protocol were specifically considered.

7.6.  Results for Scenario 01-02

   The following table summarizes the results obtained for the different
   combinations for which test 1 (Forward Route and Reverse Route
   initial installation) was performed:

   In addition to conventional scenarios as described in Scenario 03 and
   Scenario 04 with the same metric type (HOP_COUNT, type 0), different
   metric types are tested in the same network.  In the test, the
   originator of the RREQ initiates a route discovery using a metric
   type that the intermediate router does not understand (type 1).

   The following table summarizes the results obtained for the different
   combinations for which these test 1 (Forward Route and Reverse Route
   initial installation) and test 2 (Forward Route and Reverse Route
   updating), with different metric types:

                   +-----+-----+-----+--------+--------+

                   +-----+-----+-----+--------+--------+

                                 Table 28

   One of the tests failed because handling unknown metric types was not
   defined properly in [LOADng-05] (but corrected in [LOADng-06], as a
   direct result of this interop test).  Some changes from [LOADng-05]
   to [LOADng-06] that were proposed (and integrated in [LOADng-06]):

   1.  In section 13.1 ("RREP Generation"):

       o RREP.metric-type set to the same value as the RREQ.metric-type
       in the corresponding RREQ;

       is changed to

       o RREP.metric-type set to the same value as the RREQ.metric-type
       in the corresponding RREQ if the metric type is known to the
       router.  Otherwise, RREP.metric-type is set to HOP_COUNT.

       Rationale: If a router that generates an RREP for an incoming
       RREQ does not know the metric from the RREQ, it will use the
       HOP_COUNT metric as fall-back.  Per definition, all routers

Internet-Draft            LOADng Interop Report            December 2012


       running LOADng support the HOP_COUNT metric.

   2.  In section 12.3 ("RREQ forwarding"):

       3.  RREQ.route-metric := received-route-metric + link-metric

       is changed to

       3.  If used-metric-type is not HOP_COUNT, then RREQ.route-metric
       := route-metric + link-metric

       Rationale: When the HOP_COUNT metric is used, the metric TLV
       value should remain unchanged, and instead the hop count from the
       message header is used to calculate the distance.

7.8.  Conclusions

   As an intermediate test, and because of the limited time, only a
   subset of the scenarios (01, 02, 03, 04, 05) have been tested.  In
   the performed tests, in addition to the conventional behaviors
   (regular message exchanges), different metric types, especially
   unknown metric types have been used in the network.

   The results show that for scenarios with only one metric type, the
   two implementations are able to interoperate with each other.
   However, when different metrics exist in the same network, the test
   failed in some scenarios.  The problems are identified, and
   corresponding resolutions are proposed.  The updates have been
   integrated in [LOADng-06].
