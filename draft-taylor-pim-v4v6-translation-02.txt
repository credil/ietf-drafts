  Operation of a Dual-Stack Multicast Router With Address Translation
                  draft-taylor-pim-v4v6-translation-02

Abstract

   This document describes the procedures required for correct operation
   of a multicast router in a mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environment, where
   some or all of the multicast group and unicast source addresses can
   be translated between IPv4 and IPv6, and where incoming multicast
   data may need to be forwarded into both IPv4 and IPv6 distribution
   trees.  The router is assumed to support Protocol Independent
   Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM, RFC 4601) in an environment
   consisting of a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 local hosts and PIM peers.
   The work is easily generalized to other versions of PIM.

Internet-Draft       Dual-Stack PIM With Translation           July 2012


1.  Introduction

   During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, operators need to maintain
   their services, including multicast services.  Depending on how the
   operator evolves its networks, the situation may arise where sources
   and receivers support different IP versions, or where some part of
   the network path between the source and receiver supports one IP
   version, and a succeeding portion supports the other.
   [ID.v4v6-multicast-ps] describes a number of potential use cases that
   can occur.

   If IPv4 sources needed to be received only by IPv4 receivers, IPv6
   sources needed to be received only by IPv6 receivers, and the network
   were dual stack, a multicast router could simply run parallel IPv4
   and IPv6 PIM state machines with no interaction between them.  In the
   transitional circumstances described above, however, it is necessary
   to be able to map between IPv4 and IPv6 source and group addresses.
   Such a mapping introduces interactions between the two PIM state
   machines within the multicast router.  The situation becomes more
   complicated if, for administrative reasons, no translation is
   possible/permitted for some addresses.  As will be seen below, the
   changes to PIM operation under these circumstances will not be large,
   but do require some care.

   A number of authors have already worked on multicast translation.
   One of the earliest works on the topic was [ID.venaas-v4v6mcastgw],
   which was aimed at giving IPv6 receivers access to IPv4 sources.  The
   document defines a 1-1 mapping of IPv4 multicast group addresses onto
   a subset of IPv6 addresses defined by a /96 IPv6 multicast prefix.
   The multicast router is assumed to sit on the boundary between an
   IPv4 and IPv6 network, and serves as a rendezvous point for all
   groups within the /96 prefix so that it can keep track of all IPv6
   sources and receive all of their data.  It appears to the IPv4
   network as an IPv4 multicast host.

   Succeeding documents have built on the foundations established by
   [ID.venaas-v4v6mcastgw], taking advantage of advances in translation
   standardized by the IETF BEHAVE Working Group.  Implementations of
   the gateway concept have also appeared, with [Kiviniemi] as a notable
   example.  [Kiviniemi] is useful for its summary of related
   developments up to 2009 and for its extensive discussion of the
   challenges of translation of multicast data packets.

   The present document assumes a more general mode of operation.  PIM
   messages are exchanged with IPv4 as well as IPv6 peers.  The
   multicast router is not necessarily the rendezvous point for
   translated multicast groups.  Instead, reliance is placed on the
   underlying routing tables to ensure that reverse paths pass through

Internet-Draft       Dual-Stack PIM With Translation           July 2012


   dual stack multicast routers like the one described in this document
   when translation between IPv4 and IPv6 is required.

   Also unlike previous work, the present document takes the details of
   translation more or less for granted, with the expectation that they
   are documented elsewhere.  (References are given where available.)
   Its focus is squarely on changes in behaviour required for correct
   functioning of the multicast router in the assumed environment.

   The discussion which follows is framed in terms of a model of
   multicast router operation.  Needless to say, this model is a
   descriptive device, not a recommendation for implementation.
   Following the main discussion, Section 5 summarizes the processing
   required for each PIM message type.

   This document assumes the use of Protocol Independent Multicast -
   Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) [RFC4601].  Its recommendations can easily be
   generalized to other flavours of PIM.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the following terms from Section 2.1 of [RFC4601]:

   o  Rendezvous Point (RP);

   o  Multicast Routing Information Base (MRIB);

   o  Tree Information Base (TIB);

   o  RPF Neighbour;

   o  upstream;

   o  downstream.


2.  Model of Multicast Router Operation

   Figure 1 provides a model of multicast operation in the absence of
   address translation.  This model consists of four main components:
   the local host protocol interface, the PIM state machine, route
   determination (including the MRIB), and the multicast data forwarder.

   The local host protocol interface provides the router portion of the
   host protocol: Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [RFC3376]
   for IPv4 or Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) [RFC3810] for IPv6.
   It passes listener state changes for individual groups and sources to
   the PIM state machine.

   Route determination is built on the Multicast Routing Information
   Base (MRIB), as well as the secondary address information provided by
   Hello messages received from neighbouring peers.  Upon request from
   the PIM state machine, it provides the address of the next hop
   neighbour (RPF neighbour) toward a given rendezvous point (RP) or
   source, and identifies the interface leading to that neighbour.  It
   also provides metrics in support of Assert processing.

   Multicast data forwarding receives multicast data packets, passes the
   source and destination (multicast group) addresses to the PIM state
   machine, and is passed in return the identifiers of the interfaces
   out of which they must be forwarded.

   Finally, the PIM state machine executes the protocol procedures
   described in [RFC4601] and thereby creates and maintains the Tree

   Information Base (TIB).  As well as the interactions with the the
   other components described above, it exchanges Join/Prune, Assert,
   Register, and Register Stop messages with its peers.

   Figure 2 shows the changes to the model when address translation is
   introduced.  Three new components are added to the picture: address
   mapping, routing version selection, and multicast data packet
   processing.  Very briefly, address mapping maps source, group, and
   rendezvous point (RP) addresses between IPv4 and IPv6 in either
   direction, or returns an indication that no mapping exists.  Routing
   version selection decides whether the next hop toward a rendezvous
   point or source should be IPv4 or IPv6.  Multicast data packet
   processing accepts a packet of one version and outputs a packet of
   the other version.  This may be accomplished through translation or,
   possibly, through encapsulation.  Further details for all of these
   components and the changes needed in the PIM state machine will
   emerge from the discussion that follows.

3.  Principles of Operation

   This section justifies the changes to the model shown in Figure 2 and
   provides further details of its operation.

   The basic consideration behind the proposed model is that downstream
   listeners have to be served in the IP version they support, but it is
   desirable to receive individual streams from upstream in only one
   version to avoid unnecessary duplication.  Address mapping is

Internet-Draft       Dual-Stack PIM With Translation           July 2012


   unavoidable in this situation.  It is actually required for three
   reasons:

   o  internally to the PIM state machine, so state and state-modifying
      events involving the same source, group, or RP can be collected
      together regardless of the IP version used to represent its
      address;

   o  externally, to send messages in the appropriate IP version to PIM
      peers and local hosts; and

   o  to support multicast data packet processing when the packet must
      be forwarded in a different IP version from that in which it was
      received.

   Address mapping can be done at various points in the process.  The
   representation in Figure 2 assumes the following:

   o  Source and group addresses in incoming Join/Prune, Assert, and,
      depending on the role of the router, Register or Register Stop
      messages are passed to the address mapper.  The mapper returns
      either a corresponding address in the other version or and
      indication that no mapping is available.

   o  Similarly, source and group addresses in the messages received by
      the local host protocol interface are mapped before the messages
      are passed to the PIM state machine.

   o  The PIM state machine accepts the mapped addresses and indications
      along with the original messages, and stores them in the state
      information it maintains.

   [To add: references pertaining to the "how" of address mapping.]

   As a result, when a message arrives that updates downstream listener
   state, the PIM state machine is able to relate that state change to
   the state it already holds for the source or group concerned, even if
   that earlier state was established by a request in the other IP
   version.  This is because it can match on the mapped counterpart to
   the address in the earlier request.

   Consider now the case that, as a result of downstream events, the PIM
   state machine decides to send a Join/Prune message upstream.  When
   only one IP version was involved, that was the only IP version that
   had to be considered when choosing the next hop toward the RP or
   source.  In the situation presented here, however, it is possible
   that both IPv4 and IPv6 next-hop neighbours are available.  A new
   function, routing version selection, is needed to make the decision.



Taylor & Zhou           Expires January 18, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       Dual-Stack PIM With Translation           July 2012


   At this point, no general rule can be given for how routing version
   selection makes its decision.  The obvious initial step is to
   determine whether the RP or source is reachable in both IP versions.
   It is assumed for the sake of this discussion that separate IPv4 and
   IPv6 MRIBs are maintained by the routing determination component.  If
   the target source or RP proves to be reachable by both IPv4 and IPv6,
   the associated routing metrics can be made available to routing
   version selection.  However, it may well be that these metrics are
   not comparable.  Routing version selection may make use of
   heuristics, but most likely will be based on local policy.  That
   could take the form of a simple table mapping from target address to
   preferred next-hop address family.

   Once the IP version of the outgoing Join/Prune message has been
   determined, the PIM state machine can populate the source and group
   addresses in the message with the same IP version.  In the present
   narrative, this does not require another call to address translation
   because the necessary mappings have been retained as part of stored
   state.  Other implementations are obviously possible.

   Assert logic becomes more complicated in the dual-stack scenario
   assumed here.  One open issue is how to compare metrics if this
   router will acquire the multicast flow concerned using a different IP
   version from the version used by its rival peer.  As noted below,
   Assert messages have to sent out in both versions, because they have
   to be understood by downstream as well as upstream entities.

   [That topic may need more detailed discussion.  Also to do: add
   references and detail the challenges of multicast data packet
   processing.]


4.  Modifications To RFC 4601

   [This section should provide detailed changes needed to the
   specifications in RFC 4601, starting with the state data maintained.]


5.  Processing of PIM Messages and Multicast Data Packets

5.1.  Hello Messages

   Hello messages are not translated.  Rather, the differences between
   the IPv4 and IPv6 versions are as follows:

   o  In the packet header, the source address varies between the IPv4
      primary address and the IPv6 link-local address on that interface.
      The destination address is the IPv4 or IPv6 ALL_PIM_ROUTERS

Internet-Draft       Dual-Stack PIM With Translation           July 2012


      multicast address as applicable.

   o  The Address List option varies between the list of secondary IPv4
      addresses on that interface and the list of secondary IPv6
      addresses on that interface

5.2.  Register and Register Stop Messages

   The Register and Register Stop messages are routed as unicast
   messages.

   Section 4.9.3 of [RFC4601] requires the header of the multicast data
   packet encapsulated within a Register message to have the same
   address family as the packet header of the Register message itself.
   This may require translation of the enclosed packet header to match
   the outer header.  The procedures described in [RFC6145] MUST be
   applied to the header as a whole.  Translation of the source and
   group addresses (the packet source and destination addresses) is done
   as described in Section 2.

   The Register Stop message takes its contents from the received
   Register message, and needs no translation.

5.3.  Join/Prune Messages

   Join/Prune messages MUST be sent in the IP version indicated by the
   MRIB when it identifies an RPF neighbour.

   Care must be taken when switching from the Rendezvous Point Tree to
   the shortest-path tree for a given source.  The Prune for the
   Rendezvous Point Tree MUST be sent in the IP version of the RPF
   neighbour for that tree.  This implies that in the (*,G) state
   described in Section 4.1.3 of [RFC4601], the address family of the
   last RPF neighbour used MUST be retained, and the address itself MUST
   NOT be translated.

   Multicast group addresses and all joined and pruned source addresses
   contained in the message are translated as described in Section 3.

5.4.  Assert Messages

   Assert messages need to reach both upstream and downstream neighbours
   on a LAN.  Hence, if the subject router PIM has received Hello
   messages in both IP versions on an interface to which an Assert is to
   be forwarded, it MUST send the Assert message in both IP versions.

   The multicast group address and source address contained in the
   message are translated as described in Section 3.

5.5.  Multicast Data Packets

   This section applies to multicast data packets being forwarded
   directly rather than being encapsulated in Register messages.  The
   procedures described in [RFC6145] MUST be applied to the header as a
   whole.  Translation of the source and group addresses (the packet
   source and destination addresses) is done as described in Section 3.
