	    The Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol supports Mobile Hosts
	    moving independently, but not Mobile Routers in charge of
	    moving networks.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    This draft addresses this problem.  The goal is to allow
	    bidirectional communication between a Local Fixed Node (in
	    the moving network) and a Correspondent Node (situated
	    arbitrarily somewhere in the Internet).  First, a
	    mechanism of "prefix division" is presented, whereby the
	    Home Network Prefix typically assigned by PMIPv6 to a MH
	    is used by MR to form Mobile Network sub-Prefix(es); they
	    are used by LFNs within the moving network to form
	    addresses; this avoids changes in the PMIPv6 protocol
	    specification.  A second mechanism proposes enhancements
	    to the use of the DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation protocol
	    entities informing the PMIPv6 entities about the allocated
	    MNP; this is achieved by equaling MNID and DUID.

	  <t>
	    The term Mobile Router has several meanings.  One of the
	    agreed meanings at IETF, documented in terminology RFCs,
	    is that of an entity implementing the Mobile IPv6 protocol
	    with NEMOv6 extensions, and accomodating changes in its
	    Care-of Address, maintaining a stable Home Address with
	    the help of a Home Agent, and in charge of LFNs in a
	    moving network whose addresses do not change.  Another
	    meaning is that of a router which moves around and does
	    not necessarily change its IP address.  In the context of
	    this draft we consider this latter meaning.  We ignore
	    whether or not the MR runs Mobile IPv6.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    The work presented in this draft is developped in the
	    context of Proxy Mobile IPv6 <xref target='RFC5213' />.
	    With respect to prefix division, similar methods have been
	    alluded to in the context of DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation by
	    <xref target='I-D.krishnan-intarea-pd-epc' /> (with a
	    slide presentation in the DHC WG at IETF77) and of OSPFv3
	    by draft-arkko-homenet-prefix-assignment-01.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Mechanisms for supporting Mobile Routers with PMIPv6 and
	    DHCPv6 are presented in
	    <xref target='I-D.ietf-netext-pd-pmip' /> and preceding
	    individual drafts.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The methods presented in this draft are different from
	    most if not all existing documented methods to accomodate
	    moving networks with PMIPv6.  In particular, the HNP
	    Division offers several MNPs for use by LFNs, does not
	    modify PMIPv6, does not require the use of DHCPv6-PD but
	    has an inconveninent in that it may not accommodate
	    Ethernet LFNs with SLAAC.  The DHCPv6-PD and PMIPv6
	    enhancements offer MNPs potentially completely different
	    than HNP, may use Ethernet LFNs with SLAAC, modify MAG,
	    LMA, DHCP Relay and potentially DHCP Server.  
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Moreover, the PMIPv6 and DHCPv6 enhancements presented in
	    this draft rely on the use of MNID being equal to the
	    DUID, a feature absent from existing proposals.  Also,
	    with this mechanism the entity performing the allocation
	    of an MNP is the DHCPv6 Server (and not the LMA).
	  </t>
	  <section title="HNP Division">
	    <t>
	      The mechanism  "HNP Division" divides the Home Network
	      Prefix into two or more Mobile Network Prefixes (MNPs).
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      It is assumed that in a domain running PMIPv6 the LMA
	      assigns a Home Network Prefix (HNP) to the Mobile Host.
	      If we consider this Mobile Host to be a Mobile Router,
	      in charge of a set of Local Fixed Nodes (LFNs) in a
	      moving network, it is necessary to use a Mobile Network
	      Prefix (MNP) within the moving network.  Simply using
	      HNP to form addresses for LFNs, without modifying MR
	      behaviour with respect to its routing table, is not
	      sufficient.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The topology illustrated in the next figure depicts a
	      domain where PMIPv6 is run, and a Mobile Router in charge
	      of a set of LFNs forming a moving network.

	      For a HNP with prefix length 64, two or more MNPs are

	    <t>
	      In this example, the HNP/2 11000 is assigned by LMA to MR.
	      The MR divides this into MNP1 1101/4 and MNP2 111/3, and
	      an address A1 11001/5.  The MNP1 and MNP2 are used to help
	      LFNs within the moving network to configure full /5
	      addresses.  This may be achieved either with DHCPv6 (MR or
	      a DHCPv6 Server send these addresses) or with stateless
	      address auto-configuration (MR or a Router send Router
	      Advertisements containing MNP1 and/or MNP2).
	    </t>
	    
	    <t>
	      In most PMIPv6 implementations for MHs, the MAG contains a
	      routing table entry with respect to the allocated HNP.
	      Depending on the nature of the link between MAG and MR,
	      this entry has two different forms: [HNP, vif, *] in case
	      of point-to-point links (typically used in cellular
	      systems) and [HNP, eth, *] (typically used in WiFi hotspot
	      shared links).  The vif is a virtual interface, e.g.
	      "ppp0", whereas eth is a real interface, e.g. "eth0".
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      In the case of point-to-point links, it is not necessary
	      to add any additional behaviour for MR to work (LFN to be
	      reachable from CN).  It is sufficient for MR to perform
	      HNP division as described above.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      On the contrary, in the case of shared links, it is
	      necessary to perform an operation of Neighbor Discovery
	      proxying on the Mobile Router.  When MAG receives a packet
	      from CN addressed to LFN, it would solicit the MAC address
	      of LFN on the MAG-MR link (even though LFN is not present
	      on that link).  For this reason, the MR must pretend it
	      owns the IP address of LFN and respond to that
	      solicitation with its own MAC address.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The HNP division mechanism requires that the MNP be part
	      of the HNP (e.g. MNP must have the leftmost n bits the
	      same as the prefix length of HNP), and its length be
	      longer.  In case of an HNP/64 and the use of Ethernet for
	      LFNs, only the DHCPv6 protocol can be used by LFNs, and
	      not SLAAC, because stateless address auto-configuration is
	      not possible for MNPs whose prefix length is longer than
	      64, the Interface ID being of length precisely 64 for
	      Ethernet.
	    </t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="DHCPv6-PD and PMIPv6 Enhancements">
	    <t>
	      A second mechanism considers the use of MNP completely
	      different than HNP (may differ on the leftmost bit), hence
	      the use of SLAAC with Ethernet LFNs and HNP/64 is
	      possible, but whereby the PMIPv6 protocol implementation
	      must be modified; this mechanism involves also the use of
	      the DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation protocol.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	      For this mechanism, we consider the following PMIP
	      topology augmented with DHCP entities:
