Internet-Draft            RTCP XR Jitter Buffer               April 2013


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Jitter Buffer Metrics Block

   This document defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The new block type provides information on jitter buffer
   configuration and performance.

   The metric belongs to the class of transport-related end system
   metrics defined in [RFC6792].

   Instances of this metrics block refer by Synchronization source
   (SSRC) to the separate auxiliary Measurement Information block
   [RFC6776] which contains information such as the SSRC of the measured
   stream, and RTP sequence numbers and time intervals indicating the
   span of the report.

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defines an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures [RFC6792] provides guideline for reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  Metrics described in this draft are in
   accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6390]and [RFC6792].

1.4.  Applicability

   Real-time applications employ a de-jitter buffer [RFC5481] to absorb
   jitter introduced on the path from source to destination.  These
   metrics are used to report how the jitter buffer at the receiving end
   of RTP stream behaves as a result of jitter in the network and are
   applicable to a range of RTP applications.

   These metrics are corresponding to terminal related factors that
   affect real-time application quality and are useful to provide better
   end-user quality of experience (QoE) when these terminal-related
   factors are used as inputs to calculate QoE metrics [QMB].

3.  Jitter Buffer Operation

   A jitter buffer is required to absorb delay variation in network
   delivery of media packets.  A jitter buffer works by holding media
   data for a period of time after it is received and before it is
   played out.  Packets that arrive early are held in the jitter buffer
   longer.  If packets arrive too early they may be discarded if there
   is no available jitter buffer space.  If packets are delayed
   excessively by the network they may be discarded if they miss their
   playout time.

   Overall user perceived delay = network round trip delay + local
   (jitter buffer (nominal) delay + encoder serialization delay) +
   remote (jitter buffer (nominal) delay + encoder serialization delay)

   The jitter buffer can be considered as a time window with early edge
   aligned with the delay corresponding to the earliest arriving packet
   and late edge representing the maximum permissible delay before a
   late arriving packet would be discarded.  The delay applied to
   packets that arrive on time or at their expected arrival time is
   known as the Nominal Delay and this is equivalent to the time
   difference/ buffer size difference between the on-time packets
   insertion point and the point at which packets are read out.

   The reference for the expected arrival time may, for example, be the
   first packet in the session or the running average delay.  If all
   packets arrived at their expected arrival time, then every packet
   would be held in the jitter buffer exactly the Nominal Delay.

   The Jitter Buffer maximum delay is the delay that is applied to an
   earliest arriving packet that is not discarded and corresponds to the
   early edge of the jitter buffer time window.

3.1.  Idealized Jitter Buffer

   In practice jitter buffer implementations vary considerably however
   they should behave in a manner conceptually consistent with an
   idealized jitter buffer described as follows:

      (i).  Receive the first packet and delay playout by D ms.  Keep
      the RTP timestamp and receive time as a reference.

      RTP TS[1]

      receive time[1]

      Assume that both are normalized in ticks.

Internet-Draft            RTCP XR Jitter Buffer               April 2013


      (ii).  Receive the next packet

      (iii).  Calculate r = RTP TS[n] - RTP TS[1] and t = receive
      time[n] - receive time[1].  If r = t then the packet arrived on
      time.  If r < t then the packet arrived late and if r > t then the
      packet arrived early.

      (iv).  Delay playout of packet by D + (r-t)

      (v).  Go back to (ii)

   Note that this idealized implementation assumes that the sender's RTP
   clock is synchronized to the clock in the receiver which is used to
   timestamp packet arrivals.  If there is no such inherent
   synchronization, the system may need to use an adaptive jitter buffer
   or other techniques to ensure reliable reception.

3.2.  Fixed Jitter Buffer

   A fixed jitter buffer lacks provision to track network condition and
   has a fixed size and packets leaving the jitter buffer have a
   constant delay.  For fixed jitter buffer implementation, the nominal
   delay is set to a constant value corresponding to the packets that
   arrive at their expected arrival time while the maximum delay is set
   to a constant value corresponding to the fixed size of the jitter
   buffer.

3.3.  Adaptive Jitter Buffer

   An adaptive jitter buffer can adapt to the change in the network's
   delay and has variable size or variable delay.  It allows the nominal
   delay to be set to a low value initially, to minimize user perceived
   delay, however can automatically extend the late edge (and possibly
   also retract the early edge) of buffer window if a significant
   proportion of packets are arriving late (and hence being discarded).

4.  Jitter Buffer Metrics Block

   This block describes the configuration and operating parameters of
   the jitter buffer in the receiver of the RTP end system or RTP mixer
   which sends the report.  Instances of this metrics block refer by
   SSRC to the separate auxiliary Measurement Information Block
   [RFC6776] which describes the measurement interval in use.  This
   metrics block relies on the measurement interval in the Measurement
   Information Block indicating the span of the report and MUST be sent
   in the same compound RTCP packet as the Measurement Information
   Block.  If the measurement interval is not received in the same
   compound RTCP packet as this metrics block, this metrics block MUST
   be discarded.

4.2.  Definition of Fields in Jitter Buffer Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Jitter Buffer Metrics Report Block is identified by the constant
      NJB.

      [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NJB with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]


   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits

      This field is used to indicate whether the Jitter Buffer metrics
      are Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics:




Clark, et al.           Expires October 29, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            RTCP XR Jitter Buffer               April 2013


         I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled
         instantaneous value.

         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
         most recent measurement interval duration between successive
         metrics reports.

         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
         accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

      In this document, Jitter Buffer Metrics can only be sampled , and
      cannot be measured over definite intervals.  Also, the value I=00
      is reserved for future use.  Senders MUST NOT use the values I=00
      or I=10 or I=11.  If a block is received with I=00 or I=10 or
      I=11, the receiver MUST discard the block.


   Jitter Buffer Configuration (C): 1 bit

      This field is used to identify the jitter buffer method in use at
      the receiver, according to the following code:

         0 = Fixed jitter buffer

         1 = Adaptive jitter buffer


   Reserved (Rsvd.): 5 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders
      ignored by receivers (See [RFC6709] section 4.2).


   Block Length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one, in
      accordance with the definition in [RFC3611].  This field MUST be
      set to 3 to match the fixed length of the report block.


   jitter buffer nominal delay (JB nominal): 16 bits

      This is the current nominal jitter buffer delay in milliseconds,
      which corresponds to the nominal jitter buffer delay for packets
      that arrive exactly on time.  It is calculated based on the time
      spend in the jitter buffer for the packet that arrives exactly on
      time.  This parameter MUST be provided for both fixed and adaptive
      jitter buffer implementations.

      The measured value is unsigned value.  If the measured value
      exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an
      over-range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the
      value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.


   jitter buffer maximum delay (JB maximum): 16 bits

      This is the current maximum jitter buffer delay in milliseconds
      which corresponds to the earliest arriving packet that would not
      be discarded.  It is calculated based on the time spent in the
      jitter buffer for the earliest arriving packet In simple queue
      implementations this may correspond to the size of the jitter
      buffer.  In adaptive jitter buffer implementations, this value may
      vary dynamically.  This parameter MUST be provided for both fixed
      and adaptive jitter buffer implementations.

      The measured value is unsigned value.  If the measured value
      exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an
      over-range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the
      value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.


   jitter buffer high water mark (JB high water mark): 16 bits

      This is the highest value of the jitter buffer nominal delay in
      milliseconds which occurred at any time during the reporting
      interval.  This parameter MUST be provided for adaptive jitter
      buffer implementations and its value MUST be set to JB maximum for
      fixed jitter buffer implementations.

      The measured value is unsigned value.  If the measured value
      exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an
      over-range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the
      value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.


   jitter buffer low water mark (JB low water mark): 16 bits

      This is the lowest value of the jitter buffer nominal delay in
      milliseconds which occurred at any time during the reporting
      interval.  This parameter MUST be provided for adaptive jitter
      buffer implementations and its value MUST be set to JB maximum for
      fixed jitter buffer implementations.

      The measured value is unsigned value.  If the measured value
      exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an
      over-range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the

5.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  However XR blocks MAY
   be used without prior signaling (see section 5 of RFC3611).

5.1.  SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   xr-format =/ xr-jb-block

   xr-jb-block = "jitter-buffer"

5.2.  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in offer-answer context [RFC3264], the SDP Offer/
   Answer usage defined in [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute
   parameters applies.  For detailed usage of Offer/Answer for
   unilateral parameter, refer to section 5.2 of [RFC3611].

6.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

6.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value NJB in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the "JB Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NJB with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

6.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "jitter-buffer" in the
   "RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry".

6.3.  Contact information for registrations


      The contact information for the registrations is:

7.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.

   number, when assigned.

   a.  jitter buffer nominal delay Metric


       *  Metric Name: jitter buffer nominal delay in RTP


       *  Metric Description: The "expected arrival time" is the time
          that a RTP packet would arrive if there was no delay
          variation.  The delay applied to packets that arrive at their
          expected time is known as the Nominal Delay.


       *  Method of Measurement or Calculation: See section 4.2, jitter
          buffer nominal delay definition [RFCXXXX].


       *  Units of Measurement: See section 4.2, jitter buffer nominal
          delay definition [RFCXXXX].


       *  Measurement Point(s) with Potential Measurement Domain: See
          section 4, 1st paragraph [RFCXXXX].


       *  Measurement Timing: See section 4, 1st paragraph [RFCXXXX] for
          measurement timing and section 4.2 paragraph [RFCXXXX] for
          Interval Metric flag.


       *  Use and applications: See section 1.4 [RFCXXXX].


       *  Reporting model: See RFC3611.


   b.  jitter buffer maximum delay Metric


       *  Metric Name: jitter buffer maximum delay in RTP


       *  Metric Description: It is the current maximum jitter buffer
          delay for RTP traffic which corresponds to the earliest

          measurement timing and section 4.2 paragraph [RFCXXXX] for
          Interval Metric flag.


       *  Use and applications: See section 1.4 [RFCXXXX].


       *  Reporting model: See RFC3611.


   c.  jitter buffer high water mark Metric


       *  Metric Name: jitter buffer high water mark in RTP


       *  Metric Description: It is the highest value of the jitter
          buffer nominal delay for RTP traffic which occurred at any
          time during the reporting interval.


       *  Method of Measurement or Calculation: See section 4.2, jitter
          buffer high water mark definition [RFCXXXX].


       *  Units of Measurement: See section 4.2, jitter buffer nominal
          delay definition [RFCXXXX].


       *  Measurement Point(s) with Potential Measurement Domain: See
          section 4, 1st paragraph [RFCXXXX].

   d.  jitter buffer low water mark Metric


       *  Metric Name: jitter buffer low water mark in RTP


       *  Metric Description: It is the lowest value of the jitter
          buffer nominal delay for RTP traffic which occurred at any
          time during the reporting interval.


       *  Method of Measurement or Calculation: See section 4.2, jitter
          buffer low water mark definition [RFCXXXX].


       *  Units of Measurement: See section 4.2, jitter buffer low water
          mark definition [RFCXXXX].


       *  Measurement Point(s) with Potential Measurement Domain: See
          section 4, 1st paragraph [RFCXXXX].


       *  Measurement Timing: See section 4, 1st paragraph [RFCXXXX] for
          measurement timing and section 4.2 paragraph [RFCXXXX] for
