                     ICE Updated Offer Problematic
              draft-elwell-mmusic-ice-updated-offer-02.txt

Abstract

   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) requires an updated
   offer-answer cycle under some circumstances, to satisfy the needs of
   some devices on the signalling path.  When used with SIP, this
   additional offer-answer cycle interacts with other things, such as
   fax and third party call control (3PCC).  This document describes the
   problems and discusses possible remedies.

   This work is being discussed on the mmusic@ietf.org mailing list.

Internet-Draft              ICE Updated Offer              December 2011


1.  Introduction

   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] specifies a
   mechanism for NAT traversal for multimedia sessions established using
   the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] offer-answer model
   [RFC3264].  It allows a pair of endpoints to exchange candidate IP
   addresses and ports, perform checks to see which pairs of candidates
   work, and agree which pairs to use for a given component of a given
   medium (e.g., RTP stream, RTCP stream).  The mechanism can also be
   used for IPv6 transition, for determining whether to use IPv4 or
   IPv6.  A particular application of ICE is with the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261].

   Connectivity checks are performed on the media path between candidate
   pairs.  Based on the results of connectivity checks and certain
   rules, the two endpoints each determine which pair of candidates to
   use for a given component and can then start exchanging data (e.g.,
   RTP packets) on the agreed path.  Further exchanges on the signalling
   path (i.e., the path on which the offer-answer exchange is performed)
   are not necessary for the endpoints to agree which candidates to use.

   However, certain SIP/SDP-aware devices on the signalling path need to
   know which candidates have been selected (e.g., to prioritize that
   traffic or to remove the resources for non-selected candidates).  For
   this reason ICE mandates a further offer-answer exchange in some
   circumstances, i.e., an updated SDP offer followed by an updated SDP
   answer.  In some situations with SIP, this updated offer-answer
   exchange can be problematic.  This document examines these problems.


2.  Fax calls

2.1.  Problem statement

   Except where dedicated fax devices are involved, fax calls typically
   start as audio.  Detection of CNG tone (calling tone) from the
   initiating fax machine and CED (called) tone from the receiving fax
   machine initiates a switch to T.38, i.e., a switch from audio to
   image.  Where the audio call uses a compressed codec (e.g., G.729),
   if one tone is detected there may first be a switch to G.711, for
   more reliable tone detection or in case the call turns out to be a
   non-fax modem call.  Thus there can be:

      a switch from a compressed codec to G.711; or

      a switch from audio to image; or

Internet-Draft              ICE Updated Offer              December 2011


      both in sequence.

   Switching codec or switching from audio to image requires an SDP
   offer-answer cycle.  ICE also requires an updated offer-answer cycle
   where the selected candidates are not those in the m/c-lines of the
   original offer-answer.  If the UA that detects the need to switch
   because of fax is also the controlling agent from the ICE
   perspective, updated offer-answer for fax can follow the updated
   offer-answer for ICE and probably won't lead to problems.

   However, if the UA that detects the need to switch because of fax is
   not the controlling agent from the ICE perspective, there is a
   significant danger of the two re-INVITE or UPDATE [RFC3311] requests
   colliding, resulting in a 491 response to each.  According to
   [RFC3261] and [RFC3311], one UA (the one that owns the Call-ID) backs
   off for between 2.1 and 4 seconds, and the other UA backs off for
   between 0 and 2 seconds, before trying again.  This can result in a
   delay of up to 4 seconds before the switch to fax, long enough in
   practice to cause fax calls to fail.  It can also result in a delay
   of up to 4 seconds before the post-ICE updated offer-answer.  SIP/
   SDP-aware devices that need the post-ICE updated offer-answer might
   not permit the flow of RTP packets throughout this period, which
   might also lead to failure of the fax call.  An example flow is shown
   below:

     UA1 (Call-ID owner)                          UA2 (fax gateway)
       --------------INVITE / SDP offer audio------------------>
       <---------------183 / SDP answer audio-------------------
       <===================ICE negotiation=====================>
       <----------------200 / SDP answer audio -----------------
       ------------------------ACK----------------------------->
       <=======================RTP=============================>
    (ICE requires updated offer)
       ------UPDATE / SDP offer audio---

                                          \

Internet-Draft              ICE Updated Offer              December 2011


       <----200 / SDP answer image (selected candidates)--------

   In this example UA1 is the ICE controlling agent and issues an
   updated offer on completion of ICE, and UA2 is a fax gateway that
   detects fax and attempts to change to image.  UPDATE is supported by
   both and used for the updated offers.  UA1 owns the Call-ID and has
   the longer back-off.  In this example, the switch to image will
   probably be accomplished fast enough (back-off does not exceed 2
   seconds), but the post-ICE updated offer can be delayed up to 4
   seconds, perhaps leading to undesirable behaviour by SIP/SDP-aware
   devices on the signalling path, which might disrupt the flow of RTP
   and cause the fax call to fail.

   Of course, collision of UPDATE or re-INVITE requests will not always
   occur - it is matter of timing.  However, the probability of
   collision is not insignificant and, if that occurs, the probability
   of the fax call being adversely affected to the extent that it fails
   is not insignificant.

2.2.  Possible remedies

2.2.1.  Delay the ICE updated offer

   UA1, as the ICE controlling agent, will be unaware that UA2 will
   detect fax.  Therefore any delay in sending the ICE updated offer
   will need to apply to all calls and will need to be long enough to
   allow for differing amounts of time for UA2 to detect fax (perhaps
   several seconds).  The question then is whether this would be long
   enough to introduce a risk of undesirable behaviour by SIP/SDP-aware
   devices on the signalling path, which could impact all calls, not
   just fax calls.

2.2.2.  Delay the fax updated offer

   UA2 will know that ICE has been used, and therefore can expect an
   updated offer from UA1, the ICE controlling agent.  Normally this
   should arrive quite quickly (e.g., well under 100 ms), although it
   depends on the number of SIP intermediaries on the path and whether
   any retransmissions are needed because of packet loss.  Therefore a
   delay of a 100 ms., say, would probably not impact the fax call and
   would help avoid collisions but would not be a guarantee.

2.2.3.  Use reliable provisional responses and pre-conditions

   By using a reliable 183 in accordance with [RFC3262] to send the SDP
   answer, when ICE completes the updated offer can be sent in an UPDATE
   request, rather than waiting for the 200 response to the INVITE
   request and then sending the updated offer.  However, the fax machine



Elwell, et al.            Expires June 14, 2012                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              ICE Updated Offer              December 2011


   might auto-answer and send the 200 response to the INVITE request as
   soon as ICE procedures complete, so the updated offer might collide
   with the 200 response, again leading to further signalling delays
   before things are resolved.  This in turn could be avoided by using
   pre-conditions [RFC3312] to delay answering of the call until the
   updated offer has occurred.

   This might work, although it is unclear how pre-conditions are
   intended to interact with ICE, i.e., whether ICE procedures can
   continue without waiting for pre-conditions to be satisfied.  Perhaps
   an extension to pre-conditions would be required.  Also this might
   introduce further adverse interactions with SIP/SDP-aware devices on
   the signalling path.

   Even if it could be made to work, this approach would require the
   entities involved to support [RFC3262] and [RFC3312].  [RFC3262] is
   known to be rather complicated to implement (hence the reason the ICE
   mechanism was specifically designed to allow SDP answer to be sent in
   an unreliable provisional response (ICE provides acknowledgement on
   the media path, rather than requiring the use of PRACK).  Pre-
   conditions are a further complication and not widely implemented.
   Therefore ICE implementations should not be expected to support
   [RFC3262] and [RFC3312].


3.  Third party call control (3PCC)

3.1.  Problem statement

   3PCC [RFC3725] is a common technique used with SIP where calls are
   controlled from an application at a SIP B2BUA.  In particular, calls
   can be established by 3PCC, whereby the application first makes a
   call to the first party (typically the device of a user requesting
   the call) and then makes a second call to the second party, the two
   calls being joined together such that media flow directly between the
   two devices.  A typical implementation is in accordance with Flow I
   in [RFC3725]:  the controlling B2BUA sends an offerless INVITE
   request to UA1, which alerts the first user.  When the user answers,
   UA1 sends an offer in a 200 response to the INVITE request, and this
   offer is used by the B2BUA in a second INVITE request, this time to
   UA2.

   The problem with using ICE with 3PCC is that 3PCC signalling does not
   permit the updated offer-answer for ICE to occur in a timely manner.
   UA2 will often take some time (seconds or tens of seconds) before
   sending the 200 response to its INVITE request.  Yet if UA2 has
   already sent an SDP answer (e.g., in a 183 response), ICE can
   complete on the media paths and UA1, as the ICE controlling agent,



Elwell, et al.            Expires June 14, 2012                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              ICE Updated Offer              December 2011


   can attempt an updated offer.  This updated offer cannot be forwarded
   to UA2 until the INVITE transaction on that leg of the call has
   completed.

   More specifically, consider the following example flow:

     UA1 (Call-ID owner)         B2BUA                         UA2
       <----INVITE (no SDP)------
       -----200 / SDP offer----->     ----INVITE / SDP offer--->
       <----ACK / SDP answer-----     <-----183 / SDP answer----
       <===================ICE negotiation=====================>
   (ICE requires updated offer)
       ----UPDATE / SDP offer---> What next?

   In this case, UA2 sends a 183 provisional response to its INVITE
   request.  This contains an SDP answer, which is passed to UA1 through
   the ACK request.  Thus UA1 and UA2 are able to conduct ICE
   negotiation on the media paths.  UA2 will probably not alert its user
   until ICE negotiation is complete, but anyway, there will often be a
   significant delay before the user answers and UA2 sends a 200
   response to its INVITE request.  Meanwhile, UA1, as the ICE
   controlling agent, attempts to send an updated offer.  In this case
   it chooses to use an UPDATE request, but similar considerations apply
   if it uses a re-INVITE request.  The B2BUA cannot pass that request
   on until the INVITE transaction with UA2 has completed.  Either the
   UPDATE request has to be delayed somehow or rejected, in either case
   leading to the possibility of undesirable behaviour by SIP/SDP-aware
   devices that require a timely updated offer.  For example, UA2 might
   be transmitting early media, which might fail to be passed through
   correctly, or clipping might occur when the user answers.

   It should be noted that the issue of sending an updated offer in a
   3PCC situation before UA2 has answered is not solely an ICE issue.
   However, ICE substantially increases the need for such an updated
   offer.

3.2.  Possible remedies

3.2.1.  Avoid 3PCC

   There are alternatives to this form of 3PCC.  For example, UA1 could
   be instructed to issue a conventional INVITE request by sending a SIP
   REFER request to UA1, or by some non-SIP means.  However, using a
   REFER request is not an option for some types of UA, for example PSTN
   gateways.  If user 1 is a PSTN user, it is necessary to make a PSTN
   call to the user, and this can be achieved by sending an INVITE
   request to UA1, but not by sending a REFER request to UA1.  Non-SIP
   means are either not standardized or little deployed.



Elwell, et al.            Expires June 14, 2012                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              ICE Updated Offer              December 2011


   A particular example of an application that uses 3PCC is one where
   the user uses a web page to make the call, having selected in advance
   the device he/she wishes to use to make the call.  The application
   causes the B2BUA to send an INVITE request to that selected device,
   followed by an INVITE request to the called destination.  If the
   selected device is, for example, a cellular device reachable via
   PSTN, that initial INVITE request will be sent to a PSTN gateway.

   Because of the difficulties supporting such applications by other
   means, 3PCC is a commonly deployed technique.  It is not possible to
   scrap 3PCC in order to introduce ICE.

3.2.2.  Delay the updated offer

   UA1 will typically not be aware of the state of the INVITE
   transaction to UA2, and will issue the updated offer in an UPDATE or
   re-INVITE request without knowing whether the B2BUA can pass it on.
   Therefore the onus is on the B2BUA to handle the situation when it
   receives the UPDATE or re-INVITE request.  As a non-INVITE
   transaction, an UPDATE request has a relatively short timeout, but
   one possibility would be for the B2BUA to reject it with a 500
   response and a Retry-After header field, relying on UA1 to try again
   later.  In the case of re-INVITE, the B2BUA could delay forwarding
   the request to UA2 until the original transaction is complete.
   However, in either case, SIP/SDP-aware devices between the B2BUA and
   UA2 will not see the updated offer in a timely manner, and therefore
   might take action that prevents the correct handling of early media
   or clips media for a short time after the call is answered.

3.2.3.  Delay ICE until UA2 answers

   UA2 could delay ICE until UA2 answers, which means UA2 would not need
   to send SDP answer in a provisional response but could wait for the
   200 response.  This would mean the user would answer and experience a
   delay (clipping) before ICE completes and media start to flow.  Since
   UA2 would not be aware of the 3PCC situation, this would impact all
   calls to UA2, not just those that use 3PCC.

3.2.4.  Issue an early 200 response to the INVITE request to UA2

   UA2 could issue a 200 response instead of a 183 response, even though
   the user has not yet been alerted and answered.  This would be
   different from normal practice and might adversely impact behaviour
   at other SIP entities, e.g., charging, logging, forking, call
   forwarding.  Again UA 2 would not be aware of the 3PCC situation, so
   this would impact all calls to UA2, not just those that use 3PCC.

Internet-Draft              ICE Updated Offer              December 2011


3.2.5.  Use reliable provisional responses

   If UA2 and the B2BUA support reliable provisional responses
   [RFC3262], UA2 can send the 183 response with SDP answer reliably
   (resulting in a PRACK transaction), and then the B2BUA can send an
   UPDATE request with the updated offer without waiting for the INVITE
   transaction to complete.  This would seem to work, except that it
   requires the entities involved to support [RFC3262], which, as
   explained in section Section 2.2.3, is undesirable.  In particular,
   UA2, which is the "innocent party" in 3PCC, should not be expected to
   provide special functionality just to make 3PCC work.  Furthermore, a
   B2BUA performing 3PCC would not be aware of ICE and hence the need to
   support [RFC3262].


4.  Do we really need the updated offer?

4.1.  Types of devices that rely on the updated offer

   Devices on the signalling path that rely on the updated offer are
   SIP/SDP-aware devices (e.g., policy servers) that perform admission
   control or resource reservation based on SDP, without modifying the
   SDP as the signalling messages are forwarded.  Devices that modify
   the SDP (e.g., Session Border Controllers) generally terminate ICE,
   so are not an issue.

   One type of behaviour that relies on the updated offer is a device
   that is ICE-aware and reserves resources for all the ICE candidate-
   pairs.  Such a device would need to know which candidates have been
   selected, so that unwanted resources can be freed.

   A second type of behaviour that relies on the updated offer is a
   device that is not ICE-aware and admits traffic on ports identified
   in the m/c lines of the SDP offer.  Such a device is assumed to let a
   moderate amount of traffic through on other ports, so would not
   prevent STUN connectivity checks, but would prevent a sustained
   transmission of RTP.  The updated offer/answer would allow such a
   device to admit sustained traffic on the ports that have been
   negotiated using ICE.

4.2.  Types of environment in which ICE is deployed

   ICE has seen a certain amount of deployment.  ICE is not solely for
   use in a SIP/SDP environment, and some of those deployments are in
   non-SIP/SDP environments (e.g., Jingle).  ICE deployment with SIP is
   relatively sparse in some types of environment, the fundamental
   reason being that NAT traversal is frequently accomplished by Session
   Border Controllers.  This is true, for example, for most enterprise

Internet-Draft              ICE Updated Offer              December 2011


   deployments of SIP.  Where such environments are migrated to IPv6,
   often SBCs are used at the border between IPv4 and IPv6 networks and
   therefore ICE is not needed for negotiating the IP version.
   Frequently the types of signalling path device that would require an
   ICE updated offer are deployed in this sort of environment, where ICE
   is currently not needed, not deployed and unlikely to be deployed.

   On the other hand, the use of SIP across the public Internet without
   the use of SBCs does require ICE.  In such deployments, however, it
   is unlikely there will be devices on the signalling path that would
   need an updated offer.

   So basically there are environments where SIP is used and ICE is not
   deployed and not needed.  There are also environments where SIP is
   used and ICE is needed, and to some extent deployed, but such
   environments generally do not require the ICE updated offer.  Some
   such deployments may not be concerned with fax or with 3PCC, and
   therefore implementation of the updated offer might not be an issue,
   although it is believed that some implementations do not support the
   updated offer and can still operate in their target environments.

   In the future, ICE is likely to be required in more environments.
   The present SBC-based approach in enterprise environments, for
   example, might not be the most appropriate for use in cloud-based
   deployments, where it is unrealistic to have media following the
   signalling path.  ICE could be used in such environments, but the
   presence of signalling path devices that need the updated offer seems
   unlikely.

4.3.  Relaxing the requirement

   These considerations bring into question the mandatory requirement in
   [RFC5245] for an updated SDP offer under some circumstances.  This
   could be relaxed such that it can be omitted in environments where it
   is not needed.


5.  Conclusions

   This document illustrates two common use cases where the introduction
   of ICE can lead to problems with the updated offer/answer cycle that
   ICE requires in certain circumstances.  In the first case (fax), the
   problem arises at the two endpoints that are trying to accomplish
   ICE.  In the second case (3PCC), the problem arises because of a
   particular B2BUA behaviour, yet the B2BUA is not involved in ICE,
   should not need to know anything about ICE, and should not need to
   implement any extensions to SIP or SDP in order for ICE to work
   between UAs.  In both cases there are work-arounds, but these

   introduce dependencies that contrive to reduce the chances of
   successful interoperability.

   The need, in some circumstances, to conduct an updated offer/answer
   cycle on conclusion of ICE is common to both problems.  This need
   arises not from ICE itself, but from the certain types of SIP/
   SDP-aware devices on the signalling path whose normal functioning is
   impacted when endpoints use ICE, unless they have been upgraded to
   cope with the effects of ICE.

   The two use cases illustrated might not be the only cases where the
   ICE updated offer is problematic.  As more complex multimedia
   situations arise, involving mid-call (and in particular early-in-the-
   call) offer-answer cycles for changing media, changing security,
   etc., the more likely it is that the additional ICE update offer-
   answer cycle will intrude in an unhelpful way.

   According to discussions in section Section 4, it seems to be the
   case that the updated offer is needed, in practice, in very few
   environments, and therefore consideration should be given to relaxing
   the requirement in [RFC5245].
