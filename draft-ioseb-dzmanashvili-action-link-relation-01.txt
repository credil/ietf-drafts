            draft-ioseb-dzmanashvili-action-link-relation-01

Abstract

   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] standardized a means of indicating the
   relationships between resources on the Web. This specification
   defines the "action" link relation type that may be used to express
   the relationships between a resource and associated actions that may
   be performed against the context resource.

Internet-Draft          The action Link Relation             August 2013


1.  Introduction

   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] standardized a means of indicating the
   relationships between resources on the Web. This specification
   defines the "action" link relation type that may be used to express
   the relationships between a resource and associated actions that may
   be performed against the context resource.

   The "action" link relation is intentionally generic, and it can be
   used with multiple media types in a wide variety of use cases.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  The "action" Link Relation Type

   When included in a response, the "action" link relation indicates a
   target resource that is responsible for performing action which MAY:

   o   Affect state of the context resource; or
   o   Initiate process.

   The "action" link relation type can be used to indicate the
   availability of actions supported by the target resource.  Examples
   of such actions include:

   o   Enable/Disable
   o   Publish/Unpublish
   o   Start/Stop

   The "action" link relation type doesn't convey any semantics other
   than that an indicated resources represent machine readable
   description of a particular action and representation SHOULD contain
   all necessary details such as: request method, action URI and other
   related details to enable agents to be able to construct requests
   without relying on out-of-band information.

   Exact type of action SHOULD be indicated through the "action-type"
   link-extension value as per [RFC5988] and for maintaining shared
   understanding of action types current specification introduces the
   registry of actions with initial values of widely accepted and well
   understood action types.

   For example, if a resource represents a service, that same
   representation may include links to resources that represent actions

   supported by the service:

     Link: </restart-action>; rel="action"; action-type="restart"
     Link: </stop-action>; rel="action"; action-type="stop"

   In order to perform action, agent SHOULD dereference a resource that
   represents action, construct a request according to the rules
   provided in action description and send the request to the server.
   Performing action may include several steps as shown in the
   interaction diagram below:

Internet-Draft          The action Link Relation             August 2013


   1.  The client sends a GET request to retrieve representation that
       describes the action.
   2.  The server responds with representation describing the action.
   3.  The client constructs request according to action representation.
   4.  The client sends action request to the server.
   5.  The server validates request.
   6.  The server performs requested action.
   7.  The server responds with a 2xx or 3xx status code.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the "action" link relation below as per
   [RFC5988].

4.1.  The Link Relation Registration "action"

   Relation Name:
      action

   Description:
      The target IRI points to a resource identifying an action
      supported by the link's context.

   Security considerations:
      Automated agents should take care when this relation crosses
      administrative domains (e.g., the URI has a different authority
      than the current document).

   Reference:
      See Section 3.

4.2.  Action Type Registry

   This specification establishes the Action Type Registry.

   The registration template is:

   o  Action Type Name:
   o  Description:
   o  Reference:

4.2.1.  Initial Registry Contents

   The Action Type registry's initial contents are:

   o  Action Type Name: publish
