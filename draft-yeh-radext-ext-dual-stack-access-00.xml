<section anchor="s1" title="Introduction">

<t>Subscriber IP sessions can be either IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack, IPv6-only, or the legacy IPv4-only in the typical PPPoE based <xref target="BBF TR-187"/> or IPoE based <xref target="BBF TR-177"/> deployment scenarios. The user in these IP sessions can be a host or a Customer Edge router (CE router, routed Residential Gateway, routed-RG, Customer Premise Equipment or routed-CPE). In the IPv6 part of these session, the broadband Network Access Server (NAS) acting as the Provider Edge router (PE router) and RADIUS client simultaneously, usually employ DHCPv6-PD <xref target="RFC3633"/><xref target="RFC4818"/> to delegate IPv6 prefix to CE router for its customer network. In the meantime, the WAN (NAS-facing) interface of CE router can be numbered or unnumbered (Section 2.3 of <xref target="BBF TR-177"/>). The NAS can employ SLAAC <xref target="RFC4862"/> to assign a IPv6 prefix or employ DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"/> to assign a IPv6 address to the CE router for its WAN interface. Therefore, there are at least the following access types of user that the NAS and the centralized AAA server are served for:</t>

<t>The different access type of users need the NAS (Broadband Network Gateway or BNG) employ different mechanism and allocate different resource for the associated processes. The addresses assigned and the prefixes delegated to the customer hosts or CE can be explicitly got from the AAA server through attributes in the Access-Accept packets (<xref target="RFC2865"/>, <xref target="RFC3162"/> and <xref target="RFC4818"/>), or be dynamically get from the local address or prefix pool configured on the NAS (<xref target="RFC2869"/>, <xref target="RFC3162"/> and <xref target="ietf-radext-ipv6-access-09"/>). When the NAS dynamically assign address or delegate prefix to the customer hosts or CE from the pools, it can use the default or preconfigured pools on the NAS or alternatively use the indicated pools in the attributes of the Access-Accept.</t>  

<t>This document defines the additional RADIUS attributes to specify the access type of users for the simplified and proper authorization and accounting in RADIUS processes.</t>

<section anchor="s2" title="Terminology and Conventions">

<t>This document describes the additional RADIUS attribute and the associated usage on NAS and AAA server. This document should be read in conjunction with the relevant RADIUS specifications, including <xref target="RFC2865"/>, <xref target="RFC2866"/>, <xref target="RFC2869"/>, <xref target="RFC3162"/> and <xref target="RFC4818"/> for a complete mechanism. Definitions for terms and acronyms not specifically defined in this document are defined in RFC2865, RFC2866, RFC2869, RFC3162 and RFC4818.</t>

<t>The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

<t>In the above depicted scenario, the NAS acting as PE router may configure local address or prefix pools, use the mechanism of PPPoE NCP, IPv6 SLAAC or DHCPv6 protocols to handle IPv4 address, IPv6 address and IPv6 prefix assignment to hosts or CEs. The AAA server authenticates each host or CE, and returns the attributes used for authorization and accounting.</t>

<t>The attribute of Access-Type can be used to indicate the right configuration on the NAS for the users, or to report the right access type of the users to the accounting server. When the attribute of Access-Type is included, the address and prefix pools of the default configuration on the NAS are not always necessary to be indicated in the Access-Accept packet for the users' authorization.</t>
