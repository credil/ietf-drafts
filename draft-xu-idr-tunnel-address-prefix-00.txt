Internet-Draft       Tunnel Address Prefix Attribute           May 2012 
 
    
1. Introduction 

   Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and Link Aggregation Group (LAG) are 
   widely used in the core of IP-enabled Packet Switch Networks (PSN) 
   for load-balancing purposes. Most core routers in the IP-enabled PSN 
   are capable of load-balancing IP traffic flows across ECMP paths 
   and/or LAG based on the hash of the five-tuple of UDP/TCP packets 
   (i.e., source IP address, destination IP address, source port, 
   destination port, and protocol) or some fields in the IP header of 
   non-UDP/TCP packets (e.g., source IP address, destination IP 
   address). However, in the L3VPN [RFC4364], L2VPN and Softwire mesh 
   [RFC5565] scenarios, distinct customer traffic flows between a given 
   tunnel endpoint pair (e.g., the PE pair in the L3VPN context) would 
   be encapsulated with the same IP/GRE tunnel header prior to 
   traversing the core of IP PSN. In addition, since the IP/GRE 
   encapsulated traffic is neither TCP nor UDP, core routers therefore 
   could only perform hash calculation on the fields in the IP header 
   of IP/GRE tunnels. As a result, core routers could not achieve an 
   effective load-balancing for these IP/GRE tunneled traffic flows in 
   the core network due to the lack of adequate entropy information.  

   [RFC5640] describes a method for improving the load-balancing in 
   Softwire mesh networks [RFC5565]. However, this method requires core 
   routers to be able to perform hash calculation on the fields 
   including the specific "load-balancing" field contained in the 
   L2TPv3 or GRE tunnel header. [Entropy-Label] proposes to use the 
   "entropy labels" for achieving a better load-balancing for MPLS 
   traffic flows in the core of MPLS-enabled PSN. Although the entropy 
   label could be inserted in the "Key" field of the GRE header by 
   ingress PE routers in the case where the PSN is IP enabled rather 
   than MPLS enabled, it still requires core routers to be capable of 
   performing hash calculation on the "entropy label" contained in the 
   GRE tunnel header. Any of the above two load-balancing methods 
   requires a change to the date plane of core routers. 

   This document describes an alternative load-balancing method 
   suitable for the above scenarios, which is backwards compatible to 
   those already-deployed core routers that could only perform hash 
   calculation on the fields in the IP header in the case of IP/GRE 
   tunneled traffic flows. The basic idea of this method is: a given 
   (tunnel) egress router signals to (tunnel) ingress routers a special 
   prefix called "tunnel address prefix" via BGP and any addresses  
   beginning with that prefix would be used by those ingress routers as 
   tunnel destination addresses when tunneling traffic towards that  
   egress router. Therefore distinct traffic flows between that tunnel 
   endpoint pair could be encapsulated with as many different tunnel

   destination addresses as possible. In this way, core routers could 
   achieve a better load-balancing for those IP/GRE tunneled traffic 
   through performing hash calculation just on the fields in the IP 
   header.  

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4364] and [RFC5565].  

3. Tunnel Address Prefix Attribute  

   For a given BGP router to tell remote BGP routers what tunnel 
   destination addresses could be used when tunneling traffic flows to 
   it, a new BGP attribute contained in the Encapsulation SAFI 
   [RFC5512], referred to as "Tunnel Address Prefix Attribute", could 
   be used to indicate the available tunnel destination addresses to be 
   used. 

   The Tunnel Address Prefix attribute is an optional transitive    
   attribute. The TLV is structured as follows: 

       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       |  Tunnel Address Prefix Type   |             Length            | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       |                                                               | 
       |                             Value                             | 
       |                                                               | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

       - Tunnel Address Prefix Type (2 octets): indicates the Value 
       field of such TLV contains the tunnel address prefix information
       in the form of IP address and subnet mask pair. 

       - Length (2 octets): indicates the total number of octets of the 
       value field. If the AFI of the Encapsulation SAFI is IPv4, the 
       length value is set to 64; otherwise if the AFI is IPv6, the 
       length value is set to 256. 

       - Value (variable): contains the tunnel address prefix 
       information in the form of IP address and subnet mask pair.

4. Tunnel Address Prefix Extended Community 

   Here, we also define an address specific extended community referred 
   to as Tunnel Address Prefix extended community that can be attached 
   to BGP UPDATE messages to indicate the available tunnel destination 
   addresses to be used when tunneling traffic flows from an ingress 
   router to an egress router. This extended community is useful in the 
   case where the Encapsulation SAFI capability is not supported 
   between BGP routers or one really wants to specify different tunnel 
   destination address prefixes for distinct sets of traffic flows. For 
   example, one wants to assign two different tunnel address prefixes 
   for traffic flows destined for prefix X and Y respectively.  

   IPv4 Tunnel Address Prefix extended community is as follows: 

       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       |       0x01    |   Sub-Type    |     Global Administrator      | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       | Global Administrator (cont.)  |     Local Administrator       | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

       The value of the high-order octet of the extended type field is 
       0x01, which indicates it is transitive across ASes. The value of 
       the low-order octet of the extended type field is to be defined. 
       The Global Administrator sub-field contains an IPv4 unicast 
       address while the Local Administrator sub-field contains the 
       corresponding Prefix Length.  

   IPv6 Tunnel Address Prefix extended community is as follows: 

       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       |     0x00      |    Sub-Type   |    Global Administrator       | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       |          Global Administrator (cont.)                         | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       |          Global Administrator (cont.)                         | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       |          Global Administrator (cont.)                         | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       | Global Administrator (cont.)  |    Local Administrator        | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Internet-Draft       Tunnel Address Prefix Attribute           May 2012 
 
       The value of the high-order octet of the extended type field is 
       0x00, which indicates it is transitive across ASes. The value of 
       the low-order octet of the extended type field is to be defined. 
       The Global Administrator sub-field contains an IPv6 unicast 
       address while the Local Administrator sub-field contains the 
       corresponding Prefix Length.  

5. Functionality Description 

   5.1. Egress Routers 

   An egress router could attach the above BGP Tunnel Address Prefix 
   attribute or extended community to BGP UPDATE messages in order to 
   indicate the available tunnel destination addresses to be used by 
   any ingress routers when tunneling traffic flows to it. In addition, 
   it SHOULD create the corresponding loopback interface for each IP 
   address within that prefix and accordingly advertise a route for 
   that prefix via IGP. As such, it could receive and process those 
   IP/GRE tunneled traffic flows destined for any of those addresses 
   beginning with that prefix. 

   5.2. Ingress Routers 

   For an ingress router receiving the above BGP Tunnel Address Prefix 
   attribute or extended community announced by a given egress router, 
   it could use any addresses beginning with the tunnel address prefix, 
   in addition to the BGP next-hop address contained in the  
   MP_REACH_NLRI attribute, as tunnel destination addresses when 
   tunneling traffic flows towards that egress router. 

   5.3. Intermediate Routers 

   There is no special requirement on Intermediate Routers (i.e., core 
   routers). In other words, they could perform load-balancing of the 
   IP/GRE tunneled traffic on basis of the hash of the fields in the IP 
   headers as normal. 

6. Applicability 

   The load-balancing approach described in this document is suitable 
   for many scenarios including but not limited to L3VPN [RFC4364], 6PE 
   [RFC4798], Softwire mesh [RFC5565], BGP free core and L2VPN 
   including VPLS [RFC4761, RFC4762] and EVPN [EVPN]. In the existing 
   VPLS case where BGP is used for auto-discovery, the above BGP Tunnel 
   Address Prefix attribute or extended community would be attached to 
   the BGP update messages as well. Once a customer MAC address is 
   learnt against a given BGP next-hop address, any addresses beginning

   with the Tunnel Address Prefix which is associated with that BGP 
   next-hop address could be used as tunnel destination addresses when 
   tunneling MAC frames destined for that MAC address.  

7. Security Considerations 

   TBD. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   The type code of the Tunnel Address Prefix Attribute needs to be 
   allocated by IANA. Meanwhile, a new Sub-Type of the Address Specific 
   BGP Extended Communities of IPv4 and IPv6 respectively SHOULD also 
   be assigned by IANA.
