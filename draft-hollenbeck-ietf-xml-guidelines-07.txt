The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a framework for structuring
data.  While it evolved from Standard Generalized Markup Language
(SGML) -- a markup language primarily focused on structuring documents
-- XML has evolved to be a widely-used mechanism for representing
structured data.

There are a wide variety of Internet protocols being developed; many
have need for a representation for structured data relevant to their
application.  There has been much interest in the use of XML as a
representation method.  This document describes basic XML concepts,
analyzes various alternatives in the use of XML, and provides
guidelines for the use of XML within IETF standards-track protocols.

This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
improvements.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
