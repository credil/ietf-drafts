This document describes an optional extension to the Intermediate
System to Intermediate System (ISIS) protocol, used today by several 
Internet Service Proviers (ISPs) for routing within their clouds.
ISIS is an interior gateway routing protocol developed originally by
OSI and used with IP extensions as Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).
ISIS originally does not provide Complete Sequence Numbers Protocol
Data (CSNP) and Partial Sequence Numbers Protocol Data Unit (PSNP)
checksums, relying on the underlying layers to verify the integrity of
information provided.  Experience with the protocol shows that this
precondition does not always hold and scenarios can be imagined that
impact protocol functionality.  This document introduces a new
optional Type, Length and Value (TLV) providing checksums.

This document is a product of the IS-IS for IP Internets Working Group
of the IETF.
