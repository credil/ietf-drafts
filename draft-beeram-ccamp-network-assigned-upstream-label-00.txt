 Abstract 

    This document discusses the GMPLS RSVP-TE extensions that are needed 
    to let the network assign an upstream-label for a given LSP. This is 
    useful in scenarios where a given node does not have sufficient 
    information to assign the correct upstream-label on its own. This 
    document also specifies the extensions required for manipulating 
    Label-Symmetric Bidirectional GMPLS LSPs.

 1. Introduction 

    The GMPLS RSVP-TE extensions for setting up a Bidirectional LSP are 
    discussed in [RFC3473]. The Bidirectional LSP setup is indicated by 
    the presence of an UPSTREAM_LABEL Object in the PATH message. As per 
    the existing setup procedure outlined for a Bidirectional LSP, each 
    upstream-node must allocate a valid upstream-label on the outgoing 
    interface before sending the initial PATH message downstream.

 Internet-Draft     Network Assigned Upstream Label            July 2013 
         

    However, there are certain scenarios (Section 5) where it is not 
    desirable for a given node to pick the upstream-label on its own. 
    This document discusses the protocol extensions that are required in 
    such cases to let the network assign an upstream-label for a given 
    LSP.  

    As per [RFC3471], the upstream-label and the downstream-label for an 
    LSP at a given hop need not be the same. However, most practical 
    scenarios require these two labels to be the same. This document 
    proposes a mechanism for the ingress to request "Label Symmetricity" 
    at each hop of the LSP. It also discusses how the request to have 
    "Label Symmetricity" gets processed in conjunction with the request 
    to have "a network assigned upstream-label". 

 2. Label Symmetricity 

    In order to request "Label Symmetricity", this document defines a 
    new flag (Label_Symmetricity Required) in the Attributes Flags TLV 
    [RFC5420]. The position of this flag in the TLV is TBA.  

    If the upstream-label and the downstream-label are required to be 
    the same at each hop of the LSP, then the PATH sent out by the 
    ingress would have this flag set in the Attributes Flags TLV of the 
    LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object.  

 2.1. Processing Rules 

    The presence of the "Label Symmetricity_Required" flag in the PATH 
    message indicates that the LSP is bidirectional and that the labels 
    are symmetric in both directions at each hop. Since this flag gets 
    carried in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object, a downstream node 
    that does not recognize/support this flag would reject the LSP setup 
    request (indicating that the requested attributes are not 
    supported). 

    When this flag is set in the PATH message, the upstream node may or 
    may not add the UPSTREAM_LABEL object in the initial setup request 
    sent to the downstream node. If the UPSTREAM_LABEL does get 
    specified in the PATH, the downstream nodes MUST ignore it. If the 
    upstream node desires to pick the symmetric label on its own, it 
    MUST encode this in the LABEL_SET object and send it downstream. 

    The downstream-node picks an appropriate symmetric label and sends 
    this via the LABEL object in the RESV message. The upstream-node 
    would then start using this symmetric label for both directions of 
    the LSP.

    The remaining extensions discussed in this document are not relevant 
    for LSPs that require "Label Symmetricity".  
         
 3. Unassigned Upstream Label 

    This document proposes the use of a special label value - 
    "0xFFFFFFFF" - to indicate an Unassigned Label. This would get used 
    by a node if it does not have any input on what upstream-label needs 
    to get picked. This special label is filled in the UPSTREAM_LABEL 
    object of the PATH message that is sent downstream.  

 3.1. Processing Rules 

    In the ideal scenario, the network responds by filling in a valid 
    UPSTREAM_LABEL in the corresponding RESV message. If the network is 
    not in a position to assign the UPSTREAM LABEL (or if it doesn't know 
    what to do with an Unassigned UPSTREAM_LABEL), it MUST issue a PATH-
    ERR message with a "Routing Problem/Unacceptable Label Value" 
    indication. If the RESV comes in without an assigned UPSTREAM_LABEL, 
    then an error with a "Routing Problem/Label Allocation Failure" 
    indication MUST be issued.

            ---| Upstream |--------------------| Downstream |--- 
               +----------+                    +------------+

                           ------------------->

                             Upstream Label (Assigned - L1) 
                             Label (Assigned - L2) 
                           <------------------- 
                 
                           PATH 
                             Upstream Label (Assigned - L1) 
                           -------------------> 
                                           
                     Figure 2: Unassigned UPSTREAM_LABEL 
         

    The above processing rules do not apply if an "Unassigned 
    UPSTREAM_LABEL" is included in a PATH message that also has the 
    "Label_Symmetricity_Required" bit set. In that case, the downstream 
    node would ignore the presence of the "UPSTREAM LABEL" (and the 
    rules specified in Section 2.1 come into play). 

         
 4. Upstream Label Set / Acceptable Upstream Label Set 

    This document proposes the use of UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET and 
    ACCEPTABLE_UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET for scenarios where a given node 
    desires to give the network some choices when picking a valid 
    UPSTREAM_LABEL. The UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET object is the upstream 
    equivalent of the LABEL_SET object. The UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET object 
    carries a list of acceptable upstream labels and gets signaled in 
    the PATH message that is sent downstream. The network responds by 
    picking a valid UPSTREAM_LABEL from the given list and signals it 
    back in the corresponding RESV message.  

    The ACCEPTABLE_LABEL_SET is currently used to specify both upstream 
    and downstream label-sets. However, in scenarios where there is no 
    label symmetricity, it becomes necessary to have constructs that can 
    specify both an acceptable upstream label-set and an acceptable 
    downstream label-set at the same time. The 
    ACCEPTABLE_UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET construct introduced in this document 
    helps fill that void.

 4.1. Object Formats 

    The UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET object uses Class-Number TBA (of form 
    0bbbbbbb) and the C-Type of 1. 

    The format of UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET: 

     0                   1                   2                   3

    |                              ...                              | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    :                               :                               | 
    :                               :                               | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |                          Subchannel N                         | 
    |                              ...                              | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
        
    The parameters are similar to ones defined for LABEL_SET. See 
    [RFC3471] for their description.  
         
    The ACCEPTABLE_UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET object uses class-number TBA (of 
    form 10bbbbbb) and C-Type 1. The format/parameters of this object 
    are identical to that of the UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET. 
         

 4.2. Processing Rules 

    The inclusion of the optional UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET object in the PATH 
    message indicates that the LSP is bidirectional.  

    In the ideal case, the network picks a valid upstream-label from the 
    specified list and fills this in the UPSTREAM_LABEL object of the 
    corresponding RESV message. If the network is not able to pick a 
    valid upstream-label from the list specified in the 
    UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET, it MUST generate a PATH-ERR message with a 
    "Routing Problem/Unacceptable Label value" indication. The PATH-ERR 
    message may optionally include the ACCEPTABLE_UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET

                        Figure 3: UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET 
         

    The UPSTREAM_LABEL object and the UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET object may both 
    be included in a PATH message. The rules of processing when both 
    objects are included are as follows: 

    - If the UPSTREAM_LABEL carries a valid assigned value, then the 
      UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET object (if present) MUST be ignored.  
    - If the UPSTREAM LABEL carries an unassigned value, then the 
      Unassigned UPSTREAM_LABEL MUST be ignored. The UPSTREAM_LABEL_SET 
      gets processed instead in such cases. 

    The above processing rules do not apply if an "USPTREAM_LABEL_SET" 
    is included in a PATH message that also has the 
    "Label_Symmetricity_Required" bit set. In that case, the downstream 
    node would ignore the presence of the "UPSTREAM LABEL_SET" (and the 
    rules specified in Section 2.1 come into play).

                     Figure 4: Sample topology  

         
    The optical signal originating on "Router A" is tuned to a 
    particular wavelength. On "WDM-Node F", it gets multiplexed with 
    optical signals at other wavelengths via an optical-filter. 
    Depending on the implementation of this multiplexing function, it 
    may not be acceptable to have the router send signal into the 
    optical network unless it is at the correct wavelength. In 
    particular, for some tunable filter implementations, multiplexing of 
    signals with the same wavelength will result in an unreadable signal 
    on that wavelength. Hence, having the router send signal with wrong 
    wavelength may adversely impact existing optical trails. If the 
    clients do not have full visibility into the optical network, they 
    are not in a position to pick the correct wavelength up-front. The 
    mechanisms proposed in this document allow the optical network 
    specify the correct wavelength for such clients.

    Symmetricity" is not requested for the LSP in this particular 
    example.

    Step 1: 
        
       - "Router A" does not have enough information to pick the correct 
         client wavelength. It sends a PATH downstream requesting the 
         network to assign an appropriate UPSTREAM_LABEL for it to use. 
         As per the graceful setup procedure outlined in [GR-SETUP], the 
         PATH is sent out with the "A" bit set in the ADMIN_STATUS. This 
         indicates that the LSP is not operational and that the laser is 
         turned off at the ingress client. 
       - The network receives the PATH, chooses the correct wavelength 
         values and forwards them in appropriate label fields to the 
         egress client ("Router B") 
       - "Router B" receives the PATH, turns the laser ON and tunes it 
         to the correct wavelength (received in the LABEL_SET of the 
         PATH) and sends out a RESV upstream. The RESV is sent out with 
         the "A" bit set in the ADMIN_STATUS - indicating that the LSP 
         is still not operational. 
       - The RESV received by the ingress client carries a valid 
         assigned UPSTREAM label. "Router A" turns on the laser and 
         tunes it to the wavelength specified in the network assigned 
         UPSTREAM_LABEL. This completes Step-1. 
      
    Step 2: 
         
       - "Router A" sends out a PATH trigger with the "A" bit cleared in 
         the ADMIN_STATUS. This indicates the ingress client's desire to 
         make the LSP operational 
       - The network receives the PATH, adjusts the power-levels 
         appropriately (also takes care of any other applicable 
         provisioning operations) and then forwards the PATH with the 
         "A" bit cleared to the egress client. 
       - The egress client sends out a RESV trigger in response with the 
         "A" bit cleared in the ADMIN_STATUS. From this point on, the 
         LSP is deemed "ready for use" by the egress client. 
       - The RESV with the "A" bit cleared in the ADMIN_STATUS makes its 
         way to the ingress client. From this point on, the LSP is 
         deemed fully operational by the ingress client.
