                      draft-matsuhira-sa46t-at-01

Abstract

   This document specifies SA46T Address Translator (SA46T-AT)
   specification.  SA46T-AT enable access to IPv4 only host from IPv6
   host.  IPv4 host is identified as SA46T global address in IPv6
   address space.  The address assigned to IPv4 host may be global IPv4
   address or private IPv4 address.  SA46T-AT does not support access to
   IPv6 host from IPv4 only host.

Internet-Draft                  SA46T-AT                   November 2012


1.  Introduction

   The IPv4 address exhaution already became the real.

   In 03-Feb-2011, IANA Unallocated Address Pool was exhausted.  And in
   19-Apr-2011, APNIC unallocated address pool was exhaused.  Other
   RIRs, unallocated address pool does not exhaused now, however, it
   should be a matter of time.  For more details, please refer to IPv4
   address report , http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/.

   After IPv4 address running out, IPv6 only network service should be
   provided.  SA46T [I-D.matsuhira-sa46t-spec] provide IPv4 network
   service over IPv6 only network environments.  And SA46T grobal
   address [I-D.matsuhira-sa46t-gaddr]is proposed for The Internet
   scale.

   On the other side, to maintain the continuance of service by the
   server, shifting to IPv6 is also needed.  However, there should be a
   service which has difficulty to quick shift to the IPv6.  That mean
   IPv4 service continuance is still important.

   There are two approaches which use IPv4 address effectively.  One is
   address sharing approach such as Address plus port (A+P) Approach
   [RFC6346], and the other is address re-use approach such as IPv4
   private address [RFC1918].

   SA46T-AS [I-D.matsuhira-sa46t-as] is also address sharing approch.
   SA46T-AT is equivalent to address reuse approach.


2.  SA46T-AT Architecture

2.1.  SA46T address

   Figure 1 show SA46T address[I-D.matsuhira-sa46t-spec].  SA46T global
   address is same format with SA46T address, and "SA46T address prefix"
   part should allocate for this usage.  And "IPv4 network plane ID"
   value MUST unique.

2.2.  Mapping IPv4 address and IPv6 address

   SA46T address contain IPv4 address.  Mapping IPv4 host address to
   IPv6 address space is already done with SA46T address.  Address
   translation for IPv4 address is same as resolving SA46T address.

   IPv6 host address and corresponding IPv4 address should manage.

2.3.  AddressTranslation Table

   Figure 2 shows translation table for SA46T-AT.  Translation table
   contain three value, IPv6 adddress ot IPv6 host, mapped IPv4 address
   for the IPv6 host, and extry expire timer for remove the entry.


    +----------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
    | Address of IPv6 host | mapped IPv4 address  | entry expire timer |
    |                      | for IPv6 host        |                    |
    +----------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
    |         :            |          :           |         :          |

    |         :            |          :           |         :          |

2.4.  DNS mapping of IPv4 only host

   In the Domain Name System, hostnames are mapped to IPv6 addresses by
   AAAA resource records.  SA46T address can be mapped to IPv4 only host
   name.


3.  Sample Configuration

3.1.  SA46T address and IPv4 network plane ID

   In this example, SA46T address prefix length is 64bits, and IPv4
   network plane ID length is 32 bits.  SA46T prefix value is 2001:0DB8:
   0:46, and IPv4 network plane ID value is 0:46.  Figure 3 shows these
   value.

   IPv6 host address is 2001:0DB8:1:0::10.  IPv4 only host address is
   10.0.0.10.  SA46T address for IPv4 only host is 2001:0DB8:0:46:0:64:
   10.0.0.10.  FQDN of IPv4 only host is ipv6onlyhost10.example.com.
   Figure 5 shows DNS entry in IPv4 address space, and Figure 6 shows
   DNS entry in IPv6 space.

                                 Figure 6

   The address of IPv4 interface of SA46T-AT is 10.0.0.1, and the
   address of IPv6 interface of SA46T-AT is 2001:0DB8:1:0::1.  SA46T-AT
   have also IPv4 address pool for IPv6 host mapping.  This example, the
   IPv4 address pool is 192.168.0.0/24.

   The default router for IPv4 only host is SA46T-AT's IPv4 interface
   address, 10.0.0.1.

3.3.  Routing

   SA46T-AT advertise SA46T address prefix for IPv4 only host, 2001:
   0DB8:0:46:0:64:10.0.0.0/120.  This manner is same as SA46T.


4.  Processing of SA46T-AT

4.1.  Configuration of SA46T-AT

   1.  SA46T address prefix for route advertisement (2001:0DB8:0:46:0:
       64:10.0.0.0/120)

   2.  IPv4 address pool for IPv6 hosts

   3.  entry expire default time (TBD)

   SA46T address contain IPv4 network plane ID, so SA46T-AT know IPv4
   network plane ID from SA46T address prefix.

4.2.  Processing from IPv6 to IPv4

   1.  SA46T-AT examine the exists of the entry for IPv6 host, that is
       source IPv6 address of IPv6 packet.

   2.  If there is no entry, get IPv4 address for mapping of IPv6 host
       from IPv4 address pool, and make entry to the translation table.

   3.  IF there is the entry, resove mapped IPv4 address for IPv6 host.

   4.  Make IPv4 header, source address is mapped IPv4 address, and
       destination address is from SA46T address.

   5.  Translate IPv6 packet to IPv4 packet, and send it, and reset
       entry expire timer.

   The example addess translation table is shown in Figure 7.  In this
   example, IPv6 host address is mapped to 192.168.0.200.


    +----------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
    | Address of IPv6 host | mapped IPv4 address  | entry expire timer |
    |                      | for IPv6 host        |                    |
    +----------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
    | 2001:0DB8:1.0::10    | 192.168.0.200        | TBD                |
    +----------------------+----------------------+--------------------+




                                 Figure 7

4.3.  Processing from IPv6 to IPv4

   1.  Search address translation table with key destination IPv4
       address, and resolve corrensponding IPv6 address.

   2.  Resolve source IPv6 address from sourve IPv4 address with SA46T
       address generation rule.

   3.  Translate IPv4 packet to IPv6 packet, and sent it, and reset
       extry expire timer.

4.4.  Other processing

   1.  Remove the entry of address translation table if expire.
