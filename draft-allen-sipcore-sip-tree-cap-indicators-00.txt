Internet-Draft          SIP Capability Indicators           October 2013


1.  Introduction

   RFC 6809 [1] specifies the SIP Feature-Caps header field thst conveys
   feature-capability indicators that are used to indicate support of
   features and capabilities for SIP entities that are not represented
   by the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the Contact header field.
   RFC 6809 [1] also creates a new IANA registry, "Proxy-Feature
   Feature-Capability Indicator Trees", for registering feature-
   capability indicators including a SIP feature-capability indicator
   tree for registering SIP feature-capability indicators that is
   similar to the media feature tag SIP tree defined in RFC 3840 [2].
   This document populates this SIP tree with some feature-capability
   indicators that are based upon those already defined in RFC 3840 [2],
   RFC 4569 [3], RFC 5768 [4], RFC 5688 [5] and RFC 6913 [6].


2.  Motivation

   SIP sessions often involve intermediaries (typically acting as
   B2BUAs) that in addition to forwarding SIP requests and responses can
   also act as UAs to perform more complex manipulations of the session.
   Examples of such intermediaries include IP PBXs (Internet Protocol
   Private Brance Exchanges), Telephony Call Feature Application Servers
   and Session Transfer Anchor Points.  Often the manipulations of the
   session by the intermediary are initiated by one of the UAs in the
   session sending a request (such as REFER request) to the intermediary
   to for example transfer the session or create a conference.
   Additionally UAs may also need to subscribe to events related to the
   session with the intermediary accepting such subscritions and
   providing the notification of event state changes.

   Typically such functionality has been achieved by sending such REFER
   and SUBSCRIBE requests within the established dialog for the session,
   with the intermediary then intercepting and processing the REFER or
   SUBSCRIBE request rather than forwarding it to the remote UAS.
   However such dialog reuse has been problematic and RFC 6665 [7] has
   deprecated dialog reuse (except for legacy interoperability).
   However, in order to avoid reusing the same dialog as the session and
   achieve equivalent functionality when interacting with intermediaries
   using for instance REFER request requires that the UA obtain the
   Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRUU) of the intermediary and also
   know that the intermediary supports the relevant capabilities such as
   the required SIP methods (i.e.  REFER) as well as the needed SIP
   extensions, (such as target dialog extension specified in RFC 4538 in
   [9]).

   Typically B2BUAs have acted as two UAs back-to-back with the Contact
   URI being the URI of the B2BUA.  However this means that GRUU of the

Internet-Draft          SIP Capability Indicators           October 2013


   UA is overwritten by the B2BUA and the meaning of the Contact header
   field parameters becomes obscure.  Do the Contact header field
   parameters reflect the capabilities of the Contact address (i.e the
   B2BUA) or do they reflect the capabilities of the remote UA?  If they
   relect the capabilities of the B2BUA then the identfication of the
   capabilities of the remote UA have been lost.  If they reflect the
   capabilities of the remote UA then they falsely identify that the
   B2BUA contact address has the capabilities of the remote UA.

   What is needed is a way for intermediaries to pass the remote UA's
   contact address and capabilities transparently in the Contact header
   field while being able to indicate their own contact address (i.e
   GRUU) and associated capabilities to the UA.

   RFC 6809 [1] provides that addresses of intermediaries can be
   communicated as a value of an associated feature-capability indicator
   so it would be appropriate to define feature capability indicators as
   part of the global tree to communicate the GRUU of the intermediary
   and hence this is outside the scope of this document.  The feature-
   capability indicators for communicating SIP related capabilities (e.g
   supported SIP Methods and extensions) though need to be registered in
   the SIP tree.


3.  SIP Feature-Capability indicators

   The following media feature tags from RFC 3840 [2]", RFC 4569 [3],
   RFC 5768 [4], RFC 5688 [5] and RFC 6913 [6] are considered to be
   useful to also be defined as Feature-Capability indicators:
      sip.audio
      sip.application
      sip.data
      sip.control
      sip.video
      sip.text
      sip.duplex
      sip.description
      sip.events
      sip.priority
      sip.methods
      sip.extensions
      sip.schemes
      sip.isfocus
      sip.message
      sip.ice
      sip.app-subtype

      sip.fax

   The following media feature tags from RFC 3840 [2], RFC 4235 [10] and
   RFC 5626 [11] are NOT considered to be useful to be defined as
   Feature-Capability indicators:
      sip.automata
      sip.class
      sip.mobility
      sip.actor
      sip.byeless
      sip.rendering
      sip.instance

   The security considerations in RFC 3840 [2] apply to the use of
   Feature-capability indicators in the SIP tree.

   indicators in the SIP tree per the procedures defined in RFC 6809
   [11].

      Additional information:

         Values appropriate for use with this Feature-Capability
         indicator: Token with an equality relationship.  Typical values

            duplex communciations are supported).  If "full" or "half"
            is indicated then support for "receive-only" and "send-only"

      [2].

      Additional information:

         Values appropriate for use with this Feature-Capability
         indicator: An integer.  Each integral value corresponds to one
         of the possible values of the Priority header field as
         specified in SIP.  The mapping is defined as:

            non-urgent: Integral value of 10.  The device supports non-

5.11.  Methods


      Feature-capability indicator name: sip.methods

      ASN.1 Identifier: 11

      Descrition:
      Each value of the sip.methods (note the plurality) Feature-
      capability indicator indicates a SIP method supported by this
      intermediary.  In this case, "supported" means that the
      intermediary will accept requests with this method.  In that
      sense, it has the same connotation as the Allow header field.

      Feature-capability indicator specification reference: RFC 3840
      [2].

      Additional information:

         Values appropriate for use with this Feature-Capability
         indicator: Token with an equality relationship.  Values are
         taken from the Methods table defined in the IANA SIP parameters
         registry.

         This Feature-Capability indicator is most useful in a
         communications application for describing the capabilities of a
         network intermediary, such as an IP-PBX or conference bridge.

         Examples of typical use: An IP PBX indicating that it accepts a
         REFER request to transfer the session.

         Security Considerations: Security considerations for this
         Feature-capability indicator are discussed in RFC 6809 [1] and
         RFC 3840 [2].

      Feature-capability indicator specification reference: RFC 3840
      [2].

      Additional information:

         Values appropriate for use with this Feature-Capability
         indicator: Token with an equality relationship.  Values are
         taken from the option tags table in the IANA SIP parameters
         registry.

         This Feature-Capability indicator is most useful in a
         communications application for describing the capabilities of a
         network intermediary, such as an IP-PBX or conference bridge.
