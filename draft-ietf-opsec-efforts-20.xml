		<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
			<t>
			The Internet is being recognized as a critical infrastructure similar in nature to
			the power grid and a potable water supply.  Just like those infrastructures, means are
			needed to provide resiliency and adaptability to the Internet so that it remains
			consistently available to the public throughout the world even during times of 
			duress or attack.  For this reason, many SDOs are
			developing standards with hopes of retaining an acceptable level, or even improving
			this availability, to its users.
			These SDO efforts usually define themselves as "security" efforts.  It is the opinion
			of the authors that there are many different definitions of the term "security" and
			it may be applied in many diverse ways.  As such, we offer no assurance that the
			term is applied consistently throughout this document.
			</t>

			<t>
			Many of these SDOs have diverse charters and goals and will take entirely different
			directions in their efforts to provide standards.  However, even with that, there
			will be overlaps in their produced works.  If there are overlaps then there is a
			potential for conflicts and confusion.  This may result in:
			<list>
				<t>
				Vendors of networking equipment who are unsure of which standard to follow.
				</t>
				<t>
				Purchasers of networking equipment who are unsure of which standard will
				best apply to the needs of their business or ogranization.
				</t>
				<t>
				Network Administrators and Operators unsure of which standard to follow
				to attain the best security for their network.
				</t>
			</list>
			For these reasons, the authors wish to encourage all SDOs who have an interest
			in producing or in consuming standards relating to good security practices to
			be consistent in their approach and their recommendations.  In many cases, the
			authors are aware that the SDOs are making good efforts along these lines.  
			However, the authors do not participate in all SDO efforts and cannot know 
			everything that is happening.

			The OpSec Working Group met at the 61st IETF and agreed that this document
			could be a useful reference in producing the documents described in the
			Working Group Charter.  The authors have agreed to keep this document current
			and request that those who read it will submit corrections or comments.

			The first part of the body of this document, <xref target="glossaries" />, 
                        contains a listing of online glossaries relating to networking

			security and security events be consistent.  Inconsistencies between the useage
			of words on standards is unacceptable as it would prevent a reader of two 
			standards to appropriately relate their recommendations.  The authors of this

			so can offer no assurance of their alignment.

ISO (International Organization for Standardization) is the world's largest developer and publisher of International Standards.
</t><t>
ISO is a network of the national standards institutes of 163 countries, one member per country, with a Central Secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland, that coordinates the system.
</t><t>
ISO is a non-governmental organization that forms a bridge between the public and private sectors. On the one hand, many of its member institutes are part of the governmental structure of their countries, or are mandated by their government. On the other hand, other members have their roots uniquely in the private sector, having been set up by national partnerships of industry associations.
</t><t>
Therefore, ISO enables a consensus to be reached on solutions that meet both the requirements of business and the broader needs of society.

The ICT Security Standards Roadmap  http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/ict/index.html
</t><t>
This ICT Security Standards Roadmap has been developed to assist in the development of security standards by bringing together information about existing standards and current standards work in key standards development organizations. 
</t><t>
In addition to aiding the process of standards development, the Roadmap will provide information that will help potential users of security standards, and other standards stakeholders, gain an understanding of what standards are available or under development as well as the key organizations that are working on these standards.
</t><t>
The Roadmap was initiated by ITU-T Study Group 17. In January 2007 the initiative became a collaborative effort when the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) and the Network and Information Security Steering Group (NISSG) joined Study Group 17 in the project.
</t><t>
The Roadmap is in five parts:
</t><t>
Part 1: ICT Standards Development Organizations and Their Work 
http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/ict/part01.html
</t><t>
Part 1 contains information about the Roadmap structure and about each of the listed standards organizations, their structure and the security standards work being undertaken. In addition it contains information on terminology by providing links to existing security glossaries and vocabularies.
</t><t>
Part 2: Approved ICT Security Standards
http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/ict/part02.html
</t><t>
Part 2 contains a summary catalogue of approved standards.
</t><t>
Part 3: Security standards under development
http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/ict/part03.html
</t><t>
Part 3 is structured with the same taxonomy as Part 2 but contains work in progress, rather than standards that have already been approved and published. Part 3 will also contain information on inter-relationships between groups undertaking the work and on potential overlaps between existing projects.
</t><t>
Part 4: Future needs and proposed new security standards
http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/ict/part04.html
</t><t>
Part 4 is intended to capture possible future areas of security standards work where gaps or needs have been identified as well as areas where proposals have been made for specific new standards work. 
</t><t>
Part 4 includes provision for direct feedback, comments and suggestions.
</t><t>
Part 5: Best practices
http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/ict/part05.html
</t><t>
Part 5 is a recent addition to the Roadmap (May 2007). It is intended to be a repository 
of security-related best practices contributed by our community of members. 
</t><t>
This section will be based on contributions from the security community. 
</t><t>
Where possible contributions should refer to best practices relating to standards-based 
security but other best practices will be considered for inclusion. 
</t><t>
It is important to note that the Roadmap is a work-in-progress. It is intended that it be 
developed and enhanced to include other standards organizations as well as a broader 
representation of the work from organizations already included. It is hoped that standards 
organizations whose work is not represented in this version of the Roadmap will provide 
information to ITU-T about their work so that it may be included in future editions.
</t><t>
In May 2007, Part 2 of the Roadmap was converted to a searchable database format that 
allows direct links to the information of participating standards organizations. The 
database format will allow each participating organization to manage its own data within 
the Roadmap. This will enable more timely updating of the information and will also 
reduce the overhead in maintaining the information.

				Special Publications in the 800 series present documents of general interest to the computer security community. The Special Publication 800 series was established in 1990 to provide a separate identity for information technology security publications. This Special Publication 800 series reports on ITL's research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in computer security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.

				NIST Interagency or Internal Reports (NISTIRs) describe research of a technical nature of interest to a specialized audience. The series includes interim or final reports on work performed by NIST for outside sponsors (both government and nongovernment). NISTIRs may also report results of NIST projects of transitory or limited interest, including those that will be published subsequently in more comprehensive form.

				<t>
				ITL Bulletins are published by NIST's Information Technology Laboratory, with most bulletins written by the Computer Security Division. These bulletins are published on the average of six times a year. Each bulletin presents an in-depth discussion of a single topic of significant interest to the information systems community. Not all of ITL Bulletins that are published relate to computer / network security. Only the computer security ITL Bulletins are found here.

				<t>
				Featuring over 1,969 original computer security white papers in 77 different categories
				</t>
				<t>
				Most of the computer security white papers in the Reading Room have been 
				written by students seeking GIAC certification to fulfill part of their 
				certification requirements and are provided by SANS as a resource to 
				benefit the security community at large. SANS attempts to ensure the 
				accuracy of information, but papers are published "as is". Errors or 
				inconsistencies may exist or may be introduced over time as material 
				becomes dated.
