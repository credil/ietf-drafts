               Third-Party ALTO Server Discovery (3pdisc)
                       draft-kist-alto-3pdisc-01

Abstract

   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
   provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several
   hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired
   resource.  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an
   ALTO client can ask for guidance it needs to discover one or more
   ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance.

   This document specifies a procedure for third-party ALTO server
   discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is not co-located
   with the actual resource consumer, but instead embedded in a third
   party such as a peer-to-peer tracker.

Internet-Draft      Third-Party ALTO Server Discovery       October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
   provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several
   hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired
   resource [RFC5693].  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol,
   see requirement AR-1 in [RFC6708].  Before an ALTO client can ask for
   guidance it needs to discover one or more ALTO servers that can
   provide suitable guidance.

   For applications that use a centralized resource directory, such as
   tracker-based P2P applications, the efficiency of ALTO is
   significantly improved if the ALTO client is embedded in said
   resource directory instead of the resource consumer (see Section 4.1
   of [I-D.ietf-alto-deployments]).  The ALTO client embedded into the
   resource directory asks for guidance on behalf of the resource
   consumers.  To that end, it needs to discover ALTO servers that can
   give guidance suitable for these resource consumers, respectively.
   This is called third-party party ALTO server discovery.

   This document specifies a procedure for third-party ALTO server
   discovery.  In other words, this document tries to meet requirement
   AR-33 in [RFC6708].  To some extent, AR-32, i.e., resource consumer
   initiated ALTO server discovery, can be seen as a special case of
   third-party ALTO server discovery.  For that matter, an ALTO client
   embedded in a ressouce consumer would have to figure out its own
   "public" IP address (e.g., using STUN [RFC5389]), and then perform
   the procedures described in this document.  However, note that a less
   flexible yet simpler approach for resource consumer initiated ALTO
   server discovery is specified in [I-D.ietf-alto-server-discovery].

   The ALTO protocol specification [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] is based on
   HTTP and expects the discovery procedure to yield an HTTP(S) URI.
   Therefore, this procedure is based on U-NAPTR [RFC4848].  It tries to
   directly find one or more ALTO server(s) that can give suitable
   guidance to the ALTO client.  Other schemes, such as discovering an
   arbitrary ALTO server (which might not be able to give suitable
   guidance to the client in question) and asking it to redirect the
   client to a better server, are not considered in this document.

   A more detailed discussion of various options where to place the
   funcional entities comprising the overall ALTO architecture can be
   found in [I-D.ietf-alto-deployments].

   Comments and discussions about this memo should be directed to the
   ALTO working group: alto@ietf.org.

2.  Third-Party ALTO Server Discovery Procedure Overview

   The third-party ALTO server discovery procedure is performed in two
   steps:

   1.  A DNS suffix is yieleded, by means of a DNS PTR lookup on the
       resouce consumer's IP address (or the "public" IP address of the
       outermost NAT in front of the resource consumer).  This IP
       address is the source address of application protocol messages
       arriving at the resource directory.

   2.  This DNS suffix is used for an U-NAPTR lookup yielding the URI.
       Further DNS lookups may be neccessary to determine the ALTO
       server's IP address(es).

   Typically, but not neccessarily, the DNS suffix is the domain name in
   which the client is located, i.e., a PTR lookup on the client's IP
   address would yield a similar name.  However, due to the widespread
   use of network address translation (NAT), trying to determine the DNS
   suffix through a PTR lookup on the client's IP address is not
   recommended.

   Note: Step 1 could be merged with Step 1 of
   [I-D.ietf-alto-server-discovery] in order to yield a combined draft.

3.  Third-party ALTO Server  Discovery Procedure Specification

   A already outlined in Section 2 the ALTO server discovery procedure
   is performed in two steps, which will be specified in Section 3.1 and
   Section 3.2, respectively.  The following figure gives an overview:

                    \         shorten result1 by one component
                     \        from the left, including first dot

3.1.  Step 1: Retrieving the Domain Name

   Textual specification TBD.  See figure above.

   Somewhere in the figure, we do a lookup on addr/64, which is the
   "network part" of the IPv6 address computed as follows: addr/64 :=
   addr & 0xFFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:0000:0000:0000:0000.

   Note that the algorithm at some point tries to chop one component
   from the DNS name, but there is no recursion, i.e., no DNS tree
   walking.

3.2.  Step 2: U-NAPTR Resolution

   See Step 2 in [I-D.ietf-alto-server-discovery].

4.  Deployment Considerations

   The mechanism specified in this document needs some configuration
   effort in order to work properly.

4.1.  IPv4 PTR lookup

   Especially the domain name retrieved through the reverse DNS lookup
   (PTR records) and the U-NAPTR entry need to be coordinated.  In this
   section we discuss this configuration for different scenarios.

4.1.1.  Private customers or very small businesses

   For private customers and very small businesses that are DSL or cable
   customers often a dynamically assigned IP address is provisioned.
   Here, the reverse DNS lookup (PTR records) are controlled by the ISP
   and they point to the ISP's domain, e.g.:

      d-c-b-a.dsl.westcoast.my-isp.net

   In this case, it would be the responsibility of the respective ISP to
   provide U-NAPTR entries for the DNS suffix without the endhost part,
   e.g.:

      westcoast.my-isp.net

4.1.2.  Medium-size customer networks

   The second class of customers have their own DNS domain but only one
   single upstream ISP, e.g.:

   (1)  ISP my-isp.net assigns an IP address a.b.c.d to its customer

   (2)  The customer decides that reverse mapping for a.b.c.d should be
        whatever.customerdomain.com

   (3)  If the customer wants to support ALTO, he has to ask the ISP for
        the URI of the ISP's ALTO server which can give guidance to
        a.b.c.d.  Assume that ISP replies it is
        http://altoserver.my-isp.net

   (4)  The customer establishes a U-NAPTR entry for his domain

       customerdomain.com.   IN NAPTR 200  10   "u"    "ALTO:http"
            "!.*!http://altoserver.my-isp.net!"  ""

Internet-Draft      Third-Party ALTO Server Discovery       October 2012


4.1.3.  Large Customers

   For very large customers with multiple upstream connections we assume
   that they have their very own traffic optimization policies and thus
   run their own ALTO server anyway.  In this case they need to manage
   their DNS entries accordingly.

4.2.  IPv6 PTR lookup

   The IPv6 address space per subnet is much larger than with IPv4 and
   mechanisms such as privacy extensions allow a host to randomly pick
   an IP address.  Establishing static PTR records for all IPv6
   addresses in a /64 prefix is a cumbersome task and unlikely to
   happen.  One alternative is the use of dynamic DNS.  Another option
   is to do without PTR records for individual IP addresses and just
   have a PTR record for the "network address".  The algorithm presented
   in the figure above can deal with that situation due to the second
   PTR lookup on (addr/64) if the direct PTR lookup fails.
