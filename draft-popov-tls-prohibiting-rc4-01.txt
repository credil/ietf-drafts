1.  Introduction

   RC4 is a stream cipher described in [SCH], which is widely supported,
   and often preferred, by TLS servers.  However, RC4 has long been
   known to have a variety of cryptographic weaknesses, e.g. [PAU],
   [MAN], [FLU].  Recent cryptanalysis results [ALF] exploit biases in
   the RC4 keystream to recover repeatedly encrypted plaintexts.

   These recent results are on the verge of becoming practically
   exploitable; currently they require 2^26 sessions or 13x2^30
   encryptions.  As a result, RC4 can no longer be seen as providing a
   sufficient level of security for TLS sessions.

   This document requires that TLS ([RFC5246], [RFC4346], [RFC2246])
   clients and servers never negotiate the use of RC4 cipher suites.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Changes to TLS

   Because of the deficiencies noted in Section 1:

   o  TLS clients MUST NOT include RC4 cipher suites in the ClientHello
      message.

   o  TLS servers MUST NOT select an RC4 cipher suite when a TLS client
      sends such a cipher suite in the ClientHello message.

   o  If the TLS client only offers RC4 cipher suites, the TLS server
      MUST terminate the handshake.  The TLS server MAY send the
      insufficient_security fatal alert in this case.

   Appendix A lists the RC4 cipher suites defined for TLS.

3.  Acknowledgements

   This document was inspired by discussions with Magnus Nystrom, Eric
   Rescorla, Joseph Salowey, Yaron Sheffer, Nagendra Modadugu and others
   on the TLS mailing list.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document helps maintain the security guarantees of the TLS
   protocol by prohibiting the use of the RC4-based cipher suites
   (listed in Appendix A), which do not provide a sufficiently high
   level of security.
