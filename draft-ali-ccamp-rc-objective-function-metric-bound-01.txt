     Abstract 

     When using GMPLS control plane, the ingress node may need to 
     request remote node to perform route computation or expansion. In 
     such cases, ingress node needs to convey the required objective 
     function for the path computation algorithm to the remote node, so 
     that the remote node can perform the route computation or 
     expansion. Similarly, there are cases the ingress needs to indicate 
     a TE metric bound for the loose segment which is expanded by the 
     remote node(s). This document defines extensions to the RSVP-TE 
     Protocol to allow an ingress node to request the required objective 
     function for the path computation, as well as a metric bound to 
     influence route computation decisions at a remote node(s).

     1. Introduction 

       As noted in [OSPF-TE-METRIC] and [ISIS-TE-METRIC], in certain 
       networks such as financial information networks (e.g. stock 
       market data providers), network performance criteria (e.g. 
       latency) are becoming as critical to data path selection as other 
       metrics. In other words, such networks often require finding a 
       path that is computed to minimize end-to-end latency. Even if 
       paths are computed to minimize some other TE metric, it is often 
       required to specify an acceptable latency bound as a constraint. 
       In summary, there is a requirement to be able to find an end-to-
       end path with different optimization criteria and with 
       performance bound(s) on the TE metric.  

       When the entire route for an LSP is computed at the ingress node, 
       the above-mentioned requirement can be met by a local decision at 
       that node. However, there are scenarios where partial or full 
       route computations are performed by remote nodes. The scenarios 
       include (but are not limited to): 

       .  LSPs with loose hops in the Explicit Route Object (ERO), e.g. 
          inter-domain LSPs.   

       .  Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User-
          Network Interface (UNI) where route computation may be 
          performed by the UNI-Network (server) node [RFC 4208]; 

       In these scenarios, there is a need for the ingress node to 
       convey TE metrics (e.g., IGP metric, TE metric, hop counts, 
       latency, etc.) to be optimized by the path computation algorithm 
       at the remote node performing route computation or expansion. 
       Similarly, there is a need for the ingress node to indicate a TE 
       metric bound for the loose segment being expanded by the remote 
       node.  

        [RFC5541] defines extensions to the Path Computation Element 
        communication Protocol (PCEP) to allow a Path Computation Client 
        (PCC) indicate in a path computation request the desired 
        objective function. [RFC5440] defines extension to the PCEP to 
        allow a PCC indicate in a path computation request a bound on 
        given TE metric(s). This draft defines a similar mechanism to

        the RSVP-TE protocol to allow an ingress node to indicate in a 
        Path request the desired objective function at the loose hops. 
        The objective function is used by the node performing route 
        expansion to find the "best" candidate paths. The draft also 
        defines a RSVP-TE protocol mechanism to allow an ingress node to 
        indicate TE metric bound(s) associated with the route expansion 
        request.  

     2. RSVP-TE signaling extensions 

        This section defines RSVP-TE signaling extensions required to 
        address the above-mentioned requirements.  Two new ERO subobject 
        types, Objective Function (OF) and Metric, are defined for this 
        purpose. Their purpose is as follows.  

       .  OF subobject conveys a set of one or more specific 
          optimization criteria that MUST be followed in expanding route 
          of a TE-LSP in MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) and GMPLS 
          networks.  

       .  Metric subobject indicates the bound on the path metric that 
          MUST NOT be exceeded for the loose segment to be considered as 
          acceptable by the ingress node.  

       The scope of the Metric and OF subobjects is the node performing 
       the expansion for loose ERO and the subsequent ERO subobject that 
       identifies an abstract node. The following subsection provides 
       the details.  

     2.1. Objective Function (OF) Subobject 

        A new ERO subobject type Objective Function (OF) is defined in 
        order for the ingress node to indicate the required objective 
        function on a loose hop. The ERO subobject type OF is optional. 
        It MAY be carried within an ERO object of RSVP-TE Path message. 
        The OF subobject has the following format: 

        0                   1                   2                   3 
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

       |                                                               | 
       //              Optional TLV(s)                                // 
       |                                                               |

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

        The fields of the Metric subobject are defined as follows:  

           L bit: The L bit SHOULD be set, so that the subobject 
          represents a loose hop in the explicit route.

           Metric-type (8 bits):  Specifies the metric type associated 
           with the partial route expended by the node processing the 
           loose ERO. The following values are currently defined: 

                 *  T=1: cumulative IGP cost

           Reserved:  This field MUST be set to zero on transmission and 
        MUST be ignored on receipt. 

           Metric-bound (32 bits):  The metric-bound indicates an upper 
        bound for the path metric that MUST NOT be exceeded for the ERO 
        expending node to consider the computed path as acceptable. The 
        metric bound is encoded in 32 bits using IEEE floating point 
        format as defined in [IEEE.754.1985]).

     2.3. Processing Rules for the OF Subobjects 

        The basic processing rules of an ERO are not altered. Please 
        refer to [RFC3209] for details.  
         
        The scope of the OF subobject is the previous ERO subobject that 
        identifies an abstract node, and the subsequent ERO subobject 
        that identifies an abstract node.  Multiple OF subobjects may be 
        present between any pair of abstract nodes.  
      
        The following conditions SHOULD result in Path Error with error 
        code "Routing Problem" and error subcode "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE 
        object": 
         
       .  If the first OF subobject is not preceded by a subobject 
          identifying the next hop.  
       .  If the OF subobject follows a subobject that does not have 
          the L-bit set.  
        
       If the processing node does not understand the OF subobject, it 
       SHOULD sends a PathErr with the error code "Routing Error" and    
       error value of "Bad Explicit Route Object" toward the sender 
       [RFC3209].  
        
       If the processing node understands the OF subobject and the ERO 
       passes the above mentioned sanity check and any other sanity 
       checks associated with other ERO subobjects local to the node, 
       the node takes the following actions:  
      
       .  If the node supports the requested OF(s), the node expands 
          the loose hop using the requested Objective Functions(s) as 
          minimization criterion (criteria) for computing the route to 
          the next abstract node. After processing, the OF subobjects 
          are removed from the ERO. The rest of the steps for the loose 
          ERO processing follow procedures outlined in [RFC3209].  
       .  If the node understands the OF subobject but does not support 
          any or all of the requested OF(s), it SHOULD send a Path Error 
          with error code "Routing Problem" and a new error subcode 
          "Unsupported Objective Function". The error subcode 
          "Unsupported Objective Function" for Path Error code "Routing 
          Problem" is to be assigned by IANA (Suggested Value: 107).

       .  If the node understands the OF subobject and supports all of 
          the requested OF(s) but cannot perform route computation with 
          all objective functions considered together as optimization 
          criteria for the path computation, it SHOULD send a Path Error 
          with error code "Routing Problem" and a new error subcode 
          "Objective Function too complex". The error subcode "Objective 
          Function too complex" for Path Error code "Routing Problem" is 
          to be assigned by IANA (Suggested Value: 108). 
       .  If the objective function is supported but policy does not 
          permit applying it, the processing node SHOULD send a Path 
          Error with error code "Policy control failure" (value 2) and 
          subcode "objective function not allowed". The error subcode 
          "objective function not allowed" for Path Error code "Policy 
          control failure" is to be assigned by IANA (Suggested Value: 
          105).  
      
     2.4. Processing Rules for the Metric subobject 

        The basic processing rules of an ERO are not altered. Please 
        refer to [RFC3209] for details.  
         
        The scope of the Metric subobject is between the previous ERO 
        subobject that identifies an abstract node, and the subsequent 
        ERO subobject that identifies an abstract node.  Multiple Metric 
        subobjects may be present between any pair of abstract nodes.  
      
        The following conditions SHOULD result in Path Error with error 
        code "Routing Problem" and error subcode "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE 
        object": 
         
       .  If the first Metric subobject is not preceded by a subobject 
          identifying the next hop.  
       .  If the Metric subobject follows a subobject that does not 
          have the L-bit set.  
        
       If the processing node does not understand the Metric subobject, 
       it SHOULD sends a PathErr with the error code "Routing Error" and    
       error value of "Bad Explicit Route Object" toward the sender 
       [RFC3209].

       If the processing node understands the Metric subobject and the 
       ERO passes the above mentioned sanity check and any other sanity 
       checks associated with other ERO subobjects local to the node, 
       the node takes the following actions:  
      
       .  For all the Metric subobject(s), the node expands the loose 
          hop such that the requested metric bound(s) are met for the 
          route between the two abstract nodes in the ERO. After 
          processing, the Metric subobjects are removed from the ERO. 
          The rest of the steps for the loose ERO processing follow 
          procedure outlined in [RFC3209].  
       .  If the node understands the Metric subobject but cannot find 
          a route to the next abstract node such that the requested 
          metric bound(s) can be satisfied, it SHOULD send a Path Error 
          with error code "Routing Problem" and a new error subcode "No 
          route available toward destination with the requested metric 
          bounds". The error subcode "No route available toward 
          destination with the requested metric bounds" for Path Error 
          code "Routing Problem" is to be assigned by IANA (Suggested 
          Value: 109).  
      
     3. Security Considerations 

        This document does not introduce any additional security issues 
        above those identified in [RFC5920], [RFC2205], [RFC3209], and 
        [RFC3473]. 

     4. IANA Considerations 

        This document adds the following two new subobject of the 
        existing entry for ERO (20, EXPLICIT_ROUTE):  

        Value                         Description 

        -----                         ------------ 

        TBA (suggest value: 66)       Objective Function (OF) subobject 

        TBA (suggest value: 67)       Metric subobject 

        These subobject may be present in the Explicit Route Object, but 
        not in the Route Record Object.

        OF Code values carried in OF subobject requires an IANA entry 
        with suggested values as defined in section 2.1.
