 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) Option for IPv4
                             Configuration
                  draft-sun-dhc-dhcpv6-opt-v4config-00

Abstract

   This document defines a DHCPv6 option with two types of sub-options
   for IPv4 configurations in the case of IPv4/IPv6 transition.  One is
   used for the assignment of IPv4 address and port set, the other is
   used for configuring existing DHCPv4 options required by clients for
   IPv4-over-IPv6 communications.

Internet-Draft    DHCPv6 Option for IPv4 configuration     February 2013


1.  Introduction

   During the IPv4/IPv6 transition period, IPv4 and IPv6 will coexist
   for a period of time.  There are still requirements for visiting IPv4
   services.  In order to continue IPv4 communications across IPv6-only
   access network, IPv4 information is needed to be configured across
   IPv6 networks.  On the one hand, IPv4 address has run out, which
   raise requirements for address-sharing.  On the other hand, some of
   the existing DHCPv4 options are likely to be configured over IPv6 to
   guarantee success of some IPv4 services.

   To deal with the issues, [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6] provides a
   clean solution that extends DHCPv4 over IPv6 transport to support
   IPv4 resources allocation and all DHCPv4 options natively.  For
   circumstances that there are only DHCPv6 servers deployed, this
   document proposes a mechanism that introduces new DHCPv6 option for
   IPv4 configurations.

   This proposal describes a new DHCPv6 option and two types of sub-
   options which allow the DHCPv6 server to assign a shared IPv4 address
   and optionally some demanded DHCPv4 options during the IPv6 address
   provisioning process.  By assigning the same IPv4 address with non-
   overlaped port sets to multiple clients, the clients can share the
   IPv4 address and continue to deliver IPv4 services to subscribers.

   The IPv4 Configuration Option described in this document can be used
   in various deployment scenarios, some of which are described in
   [RFC6346]

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  DHCPv6 Option for IPv4 Configuration

3.1.  Option Format

   The IPv4 Configuration DHCPv6 Option consists of two types of sub-
   options, one for shared IPv4 address and the other for importing
   existing DHCPv4 options.  The SUB_OPT_SHARRED_ADDR MUST be conveyed
   by the IPv4 Configuration Option while the SUB_OPT_v4OPT MAY be
   conveyed if necessary.  The format of IPv4 Configuration DHCPv6
   Option is shown in Figure 1.

   o  option-length: This field indicating the length of the option
      excluding the 'Option Code' and the 'Option Length' fields.  In
      this option, the option-length is variable, with value of no less
      than 12 octets.

   o  sub-option-code: Specify the code of sub-option, which should be
      either SUB_OPT_SHARRED_ADDR or SUB_OPT_v4OPT.

   o  sub-option-length: Length of sub-option.

   o  sub-option-content: The content of enclosed sub-option.

3.2.  Shared IPv4 address Sub-Option

   This sub-option is defined for a shared IPv4 address assignment.  The
   sub-option format is shown in the following figure.

         0                   1                   2                   3

   o  sub-option-length: The length this option is 8.

   o  Port Set Index: Port Set Index identifies a set of ports assigned
      to a device.  The first k bits on the left of the 2-octet field is
      the Port Set Index value, with the rest of the field right padding
      zeros.

   o  Port Set Mask: Port Set Mask indicates the position of the bits
      used to build the mask.  The first k bits on the left is padding
      ones while the remained (16-k) bits of the 2-octet field on the
      right is padding zeros.

   In the context of this sub-option, the port number should consist of
   port set prefix and port number suffix.  The port set prefix can be
   got from Port Set Index and Port Set Mask, while port number suffix
   can change continuously.  The format of port number is shown in
   Figure 2.

           0                                                    15

           +-----------------------+-----------------------------+
           |<-------k bits-------->|<--------(16-k) bits-------->|

   Figure 3 Bit Representation of a port number

   In order to exclude the system ports ([I-D.ietf-tsvwg-iana-ports]) or
   ports saved by SPs, the former port-sets that contains well-known
   ports SHOULD NOT be assigned.

   For example: If k is 10 (the left 10 bits of Port Set Mask is '1'),
   the first 16 port sets is located in well-known port space, which
   should not be allocated.  Or,

   For example: If k is 4 (the left 4 bits of Port Set Mask is '1'), the
   first port set (0 - 4095) contains the well-know port space.  It
   should be perceived as well.

3.3.  Sub-Option for Conveying Existing DHCPv4 Options

   This sub-option is used for the cases that some of the existing
   DHCPv4 options are needed to be provisioned to the end users.  The
   existing DHCPv4 options can be put in with original formats remained.
   This sub-option MUST NOT appear in OPTION_V4CONFIG if
   SUB_OPT_SHARED_ADDR is not conveyed.  The sub-option format is as
   follows.

         0                   1                   2                   3

      this field one by one.  The format of DHCPv4 options will not
      change.

4.  Server Behavior

   TBD.

5.  Client Behavior

   TBD

6.  Security Consideration

6.1.  Denial-of-Service

   The solution is generally vulnerable to DoS when used in shared
   medium or when access network authentication is not a prerequisite to
   IP address assignment.  The solution SHOULD only be used on point-to-
   point links, tunnels, and/or in environments where authentication at
   link layer is performed before IP address assignment, and not shared
   medium.

7.  IANA Consideration

   IANA is kindly requested to allocate DHCPv6 option code to the
   OPTION_V4CONFIG, DHCPv6 sub-option codes to the SUB_OPT_SHARRED_ADDR
   and SUB_OPT_v4OPT.  The code should be added to the DHCPv6 option
   code space.
