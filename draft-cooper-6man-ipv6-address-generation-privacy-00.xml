	<t>IPv6 was designed to improve upon IPv4 in many respects, and

		In addition to static address assignment and DHCP, stateless

		routers advertise on-link prefixes and hosts generate their own

		<t>Deriving the IID from a globally unique IEEE identifier <xref target="RFC2462" /> was one of the earliest mechanisms developed.

This document identifies four types of threats against IEEE-identifier-based IIDs, and discusses how other existing techniques for generating IIDs do or do not mitigate those threats.</t>

	 <!-- ====================================================================== -->

    <section anchor="threats" title="Weaknesses in IEEE-identifier-based IIDs">
	<t>There are a number of privacy and security implications that exist for hosts that use IEEE-identifier-based IIDs. This section discusses four generic attack types: correlation of activities over time, location tracking, device-specific vulnerability exploitation, and address scanning. The first three of these rely on the attacker first gaining knowledge of the target host's IID. This can be achieved by a number of different attackers: the operator of a server to which the host connects, such as a web server or a peer-to-peer server; an entity that connects to the same network as the target (such as a conference network or any public network); or an entity that is on-path to the destinations with which the host communicates,
		   such as a network operator.</t>
	
	<section anchor="correlation" title="Correlation of activities over time">
		<t>As with other identifiers, an IPv6 address can be used to correlate the activities of a host for at least as long as the lifetime of the address. The correlation made possible by IEEE-identifier-based IIDs is of particular concern because MAC addresses are much more permanent than, say, DHCP 
		leases. MAC addresses tend to last roughly the lifetime of a device's
		network interface, allowing correlation on the order of years, compared
		to days for DHCP.</t>
			
			<t>As <xref target="RFC4941" /> explains,
<list style="hanging">
<t>
 "[t]he use of a non-changing interface identifier to form addresses is a
		specific instance of the more general case where a constant identifier
		is reused over an extended period of time and in multiple independent
		activities. Anytime the same identifier is used in multiple contexts,
		it becomes possible for that identifier to be used to correlate
		seemingly unrelated activity. ... The use of a constant
		identifier within an address is of special concern because addresses
		are a fundamental requirement of communication and cannot easily be
		hidden from eavesdroppers and other parties. Even when higher layers
		encrypt their payloads, addresses in packet headers appear in the
		clear."
</t>
</list>
</t> 
		
		<t>IP addresses are just one example of information that can be used to correlate activities over time. DNS names, cookies <xref target="RFC6265" />, browser fingerprints <xref target="Panopticlick" />, and application-layer usernames can all be used to link a host's activities together. Although IEEE-identifier-based IIDs are likely to last at least as long or longer than these other identifiers, IIDs generated in other ways may have shorter or longer lifetimes than these identifiers depending on how they are generated. Therefore, the extent to which a host's activities can be correlated depends on whether the host uses multiple identifiers together and the lifetimes of all of those identifiers. Frequently refreshing an IPv6 address may not mitigate correlation if an attacker has access to other longer lived identifiers for a particular host. This is an important caveat to keep in mind throughout the discussion of correlation in this document. For further discussion of correlation, see Section 5.2.1 of <xref target="I-D.iab-privacy-considerations" />.</t>
	</section>
	
	<section anchor="location" title="Location tracking">
	<t>Because the IPv6 address structure is divided between a topological portion and an interface identifier portion, an interface identifier that remains constant when a host connects to different networks (as an IEEE-identifier-based IID does) provides a way for observers to track the movements of that host. In a passive attack on a mobile host, a server that receives connections from the same host over time would be able to determine the host's movements as its prefix changes.</t>
	
	<t>Active attacks are also possible. An attacker that first learns the host's interface identifier by being connected to the same network segment,  running a server that the host connects to, or being on-path to the host's communications could subsequently probe other networks for the
	   presence of the same interface identifier by sending a probe packet
	 (ICMPv6 Echo Request, or any other probe packet). Even if the host
	   does not respond, the first hop router will usually respond with an
	   ICMP Address Unreachable when the host is not present, and be silent
	   when the host is present.
	</t>
	</section>  
	
	<section anchor="address-scanning" title="Address scanning">
		<t>The structure of IEEE-based identifiers used for address generation can be leveraged by an attacker to reduce the target search space <xref target="I-D.ietf-opsec-ipv6-host-scanning"/>. The 24-bit Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) of MAC addresses, together with the fixed value (0xff, 0xfe) used to form a Modified EUI-64 Interface Identifier, greatly help to reduce the search space, making it easier for an attacker to scan for individual addresses using widely-known
		   popular OUIs.</t>
	</section>  
	
	<section anchor="device-specific" title="Device-specific vulnerability exploitation">
		<t>IPv6 addresses that embed IEEE identifiers leak information about the device (Network Interface Card vendor, or even Operating System
		   and/or software type), which could be leveraged by an attacker with
		   knowledge of device/software-specific vulnerabilities to quickly find possible targets. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in hosts whose IIDs they have previously obtained, or scan an address space to find potential targets.</t>

<section anchor="properties" title="Privacy and security properties of address generation mechanisms">
	
	<t>Analysis of the extent to which a particular host is protected against the threats described in <xref target="threats" /> depends on how each of a host's IIDs is generated and used. In some scenarios, a host configures a single global address and uses it for all communications. In other scenarios, a host configures multiple addresses using different mechanisms and may use any or all of them. This section compares the privacy and security properties of a variety of IID generation/use scenarios. The scenarios are grouped according to whether one or more addresses are configured.

	<section anchor="manual" title="Static, manually configured address only">
		<t>Because static, manually configured addresesses are persistent, both correlation and location tracking are possible for the life of the address.</t>
<t>The extent to which location tracking can be successfully performed depends, to a some extent, on the uniqueness of the employed Intarface ID. For example, one would expect "low byte" Interface IDs to be more widely reused than, for example, Interface IDs where the whole 64-bits follow some pattern that is unique to a specific organization. Widely reused Interface IDs will typically lead to false positives when performing location tracking.</t>

<t>
Because they do not embed OUIs, manually configured addresses are not vulnerable to device-specific exploitation. Whether they are vulnerable to address scanning depends on the specifics of how they are generated.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="CGA" title="Cryptographically generated address only">
	<t>Cryptographically generated addresses (CGAs) <xref target="RFC3972" /> bind a hash of the host's public key to an IPv6 address in the SEcure Neighbor
	      Discovery (SEND) <xref target="RFC3971" /> protocol. CGAs are uniquely generated for each subnet prefix, which means that correlation is possible within a single network only. A host that stays connected to the same network could therefore be tracked at length, whereas a mobile host's activities could only be correlated for the duration of each network connection. Location tracking is not possible with CGAs. CGAs also do not allow device-specific exploitation or address scanning attacks.</t>

	<t>Although a mechanism to generate a static, random IID has not been standardized, it has been in wide use for many years on at least one platform (Windows). Windows uses the <xref target="RFC4941" /> random generation mechanism in lieu of generating an IEEE-identifier-based IID. This mitigates the device-specific exploitation and address scanning attacks, but still allows correlation and location tracking because the address is persistent across networks and time.</t>

<section anchor="multiple-addresses" title="Multiple-address scenarios">	 
	
	<t><xref target="RFC3041" /> (later obsoleted by <xref target="RFC4941" />) sought to address some of the problems described in <xref target="threats" /> by defining "temporary addresses" (commonly
	referred to as "privacy addresses") for outbound connections.
	Temporary addresses are meant to supplement the other IIDs that a
	device might use, not to replace them. They are randomly generated and change daily by default. The idea was for temporary addresses to be
	used for outgoing connections (e.g. web browsing) while maintaining the ability to use
	a stable address when more address stability is desired (e.g., in
	DNS advertisements).</t>
	
	<t><xref target="RFC3484" /> originally specified that stable addresses be used for outbound
	connections unless an application explicitly prefers temporary
	addresses. The default preference for stable addresses was established
	to avoid applications potentially failing due to the short lifetime of
	temporary addresses or the possibility of a reverse look-up failure or
	error. However, <xref target="RFC3484" /> allowed that "implementations for which
	privacy considerations outweigh these application compatibility
	concerns MAY reverse the sense of this rule" and instead prefer by default temporary addresses rather than stable addresses. Indeed most implementations (notably including Windows) chose to default to temporary
   addresses for outbound connections since privacy was considered more
   important (and few applications supported IPv6 at the time, so application
   compatibility concerns were minimal). <xref target="RFC6724" /> then obsoleted <xref target="RFC3484" />
   and changed the default to match what implementations actually did.
   </t>
	
	<t>The envisioned relationship in <xref target="RFC3484" /> between stability of an address and its use in "public" can be misleading when conducting privacy analysis. The stability of an address and the extent to which it is linkable to some other public identifier are independent of one another. For example, there is nothing that prevents a host from publishing a temporary address in a public place, such as the DNS. Publishing both a stable address and a temporary address in the DNS or elsewhere where they can be linked together by a public identifier allows the host's activities when using either address to be correlated together.</t>
	
	<t>Moreover, because temporary addresses were designed to supplement other addresses generated by a host, the host may still configure a more stable address even if it only ever intentionally uses temporary addresses (as source addresses) for communication to off-link destinations. An attacker can probe for the stable address even if it is never used as such a source address or advertised (e.g., in DNS or SIP) outside the link.</t> 
	
	<t>The scenarios in this section describe the privacy and security properties in cases where a host configures both a temporary address and an address generated via another mechanism. The analysis distinguishes between cases when both addresses are used as source addresses or are advertised off-link and cases where only the temporary address is used in those manners.</t>
	
	<t>[TO DO: Add in Temporary + manual, Temporary + DHCP, Temporary + other link-layer-derived, Temporary + CGA, and perhaps re-arrange this section to avoid repetition.]</t>
	
<section anchor="temporary-IEEE" title="Temporary addresses and IEEE-identifier-based address">
	<t>By using an IEEE-identifier-based IID and temporary addresses, a host can be vulnerable to the same attacks as if temporary addresses were not in use, although the viability of some of them depends on how the host uses each address. An attacker can correlate all of the host's activities for which it uses its IEEE-identifier-based IID. Once an attacker has obtained the IEEE-identifier-based IID, location tracking becomes possible on other networks even if the host only makes use of temporary addresses on those other networks; the attacker can actively probe the other networks for the presence of the IEEE-identifier-based IID. Device-specific vulnerabilities can still be exploited. Address scanning is also still possible because the IEEE-identifier-based address can be probed.</t>
	
	<t>A host that configures but does not use an IEEE-identifier-based IID is vulnerable to address scanning because the address can be probed even if the IEEE-identifier-based address is otherwise never used. Once an attacker has received such a response, it can exploit device-specific vulnerabilities or probe other networks over time to track the location of the host. Correlation over time, however, is significantly mitigated, since the temporary addresses that the host routinely uses on the network refresh often.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="temporary-random" title="Temporary addresses and persistent random address">
	<t>Using a persistent, random address as a stable address for server-like connections together with temporary addresses for outbound connections presents some improvements over the previous scenario. The address scanning and device-specific exploitation attacks are no longer possible because the OUI is no longer embedded in any of the host's addresses. However, correlation of some activities across time and location tracking are both still possible because the random IID is persistent. As in <xref target="temporary-IEEE" />, once an attacker has obtained the host's random IID, location tracking is possible on any network by probing for that IID, even if the host only uses temporary addresses on those networks.</t>
	
		<t>A host that configures but does not use a persistent random address mitigates all four threats. Correlation is only possible for the lifetime of a temporary address. The persistent random address cannot be easily discovered in an address scan (although it is available to an on-link adversary), which prevents an attacker from using it for location tracking or device-specific exploitation.</t>

<section anchor="temporary-random-network" title="Temporary addresses and random-per-network addresses">
	<t>When used together with temporary addresses, the random-per-network mechanism <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses" /> improves upon the previous scenario by limiting the potential for correlation to the lifetime of the random-per-network address (which may still be lengthy for hosts that are not mobile) and eliminating the possibility for location tracking (since a different IID is generated for each subnet prefix).</t>

	<t>Since IPv6 subnets have unique prefixes, they reveal some information

	<t>Teredo <xref target="RFC4380" /> specifies a means to generate an IPv6 address from

	zero. This makes it relatively easy for an attacker to scan for IPv6
	addresses by guessing the Teredo client's IPv4 address and port (which
	for many NATs is not randomized). For this reason, popular implementations (e.g., Windows), began
	deviating from the standard by including 12 random bits in place of

	MAC-derived suffixes are therefore largely not eligible to receive the
	benefits of compliance certification (e.g., use of the IPv6 logo,
	eligibility for government contracts, etc.). This document recommends
	   that these be relaxed to allow other forms of address generation that
	   are more amenable to privacy.
