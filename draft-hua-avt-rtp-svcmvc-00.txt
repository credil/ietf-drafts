                      draft-hua-avt-rtp-svcmvc-00

Abstract

   This memo specifies how to support RTP packet stream thinning (or
   rate adaptation) and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) with the
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) running over UDP to make effect in
   parallel with reliable RTCP report to the RTP sender.  It introduces
   "dummy RTP packets" into the single-session transmission (SST) mode
   for Scalable Video Coding (SVC) and Multiview Video Coding (MVC).
   The reactions of RTP receivers upon receiving the "dummy RTP packets"
   are defined.  The document also recommend to extend the ECN
   functionalities based on the scalability feature of SVC and MVC.

Internet-Draft        Extension of RTP for SVC/MVC         November 2012


1.  Introduction

   The SVC and MVC bring new challenges for the ECN design.  Based on
   congestion control principle, media-aware network elements (MANEs)
   may perform media-aware stream thinning i.e. selective removing
   incoming RTP packets or portions thereof.  It implies that MANEs may
   need to rewrite the RTP header as defined in RFC 6190 [RFC6190].
   During the period of stream thinning making effect, routers in the
   video transmission path may apply ECN due to their impending
   congestion and indicate to the RTP sender.  In this situation, as the
   RTP receiver does not aware the removing of RTP packets the MANEs
   have done, it will not counter the dropped RTP packets by the MANEs
   when calculating parameters of the RTCP signaling (specified as ECN
   feedback report and ECN summary report, see [RFC6679] for details)
   e.g.  "ECT(0) Counter", "ECT(1) Counter", "Lost Packets Counter".  As
   a result, the RTCP reports from the RTP receiver to the RTP sender
   are not accurate and reliable for SVC and MVC streams.

   Based on above considerations, mechanisms defined in this document
   aim to improve the accuracy of RTCP reports for SVC and MVC streams
   over UDP and in return help the RTP sender to achieve a better rate
   adaptation or congestion control effect.

   The document recommends to improve current stream thinning or rate
   adaptation schemes in MANEs for SVC or MVC bitstreams.  It introduces
   "dummy RTP packets" into the single-session transmission mode.  The
   reactions of RTP receivers upon receiving the "dummy RTP packets" are
   also defined.

   The document recommends to extend the ECN functionalities based on
   the scalability feature of SVC and MVC.  Corresponding behaviours of
   routers or other network element with ECN capability are defined.
   The behaviours of receivers upon receiving ECN-CE marked packet are
   also specified.

1.1.  Background

   The mechanisms defined for ECN provide in-band ways to indicate
   congestion before packet loss occuring.  Two bit ECN field was
   defined for IP packets to indicate ECN-capable packets as well as
   ECN-CE marked packets.  In addition to the functionality given by the
   ECN field in the IP packet header, ECN requires support from the
   transport protocol to inform the sender that ECN-CE marked packets
   are being received.  As regards to TCP, RFC 3168 [RFC3168] specifies
   the incorporation of ECN to TCP and IP.  It leaves issues of ECN in
   other transport protocols to further research.

   UDP-based transports, such as RTP [RFC3550], faces challenges to use

   ECN due to lack of feedback mechanisms directly in UDP.  Later on,
   [RFC6679] defines how ECN can be used with RTP over UDP.  By using
   RTCP as a feedback mechanism, both periodic ECN feedback and timely
   report of congestion events are supported.  It defines a new RTCP
   Extended Report (XR) block for periodic ECN feedback and a new RTCP
   transport feedback message for timely reporting of congestion events.

   As defined in RFC 6190 [RFC6190] and [I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-mvc] both
   single session transmission (SST) and multi-session transmission
   (MST) are defined for SVC and MVC.  In the case of SST all SVC or MVC
   data are carried in a single RTP session.  In the case of MST two or
   more RTP sessions are used to carry the SVC or MVC data.

1.2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The abbreviations and definitions "Sender", "Receiver", "ECN Capable
   Packets", "ECN-CE" and "not-ECT Packets" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC6679].

   The abbreviations and definitions "Enhancement layer", "Empty NAL
   unit", "MANE", "Multi-session transmission", "RTP packet stream" and
   "single-session transmission" are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC6190].

   The abbreviations and definitions "Base view", "non-base view", are
   to be interpreted as described in [I-D.ietf-payload-rtp-mvc].

1.2.1.  Definitions Specific to This Memo

   Dummy RTP packet: For a given RTP packet, a dummy RTP packet replaces
   the payload of one or more NAL units with an empty NAL unit.


2.  Discussion and Design Rationale

2.1.  Assumptions

   Before the descriptions of the solutions defined in this document,
   work assumptions of this document are listed as bellow.

   o  Assumption1: One SVC or MVC bitstream could consist of one or more
      RTP sub- streams, i.e. single-session transmission (SST) mode or
      multiple-session transmission (MST) mode in other words.  In this
      document we only consider the SST transmission mode.

Internet-Draft        Extension of RTP for SVC/MVC         November 2012


   o  Assumption2: The solutions defined in this document are complied
      with the four different pieces (as specified by Section 4 in
      [RFC6679]) that together make the solution for using ECN with RTP
      over UDP/IP work.

   o  Assumption3: This document assumes that initiation of ECN usage in
      one or more RTP Sessions is finished.  Receivers tell the sender
      that their paths support ECN.  And the RTP sender makes the
      decision to use ECN (otherwise the problems proposed to solve in
      this document do not exist) by setting ECT(0) or ECT(1) codepoint
      in the corresponding IP packet flow.

2.2.  Interoperability

   For interoperability we mandate both the implementation of RTCP XR
   extension for periodic ECN feedback purpose and the ECN feedback
   format, which require the RTP/AVPF profile to ensure timely feedback.


3.  RTP extension for ECN

   The scalability features of SVC and MVC enable the adapation
   functionality to be performed at the RTP sender, the RTP receiver or
   in MANEs.  The MANEs can find that the RTP sender uses ECN when
   receiving IP packets marked as ECT(0) and ECT(1).  For these IP
   packets, when MANEs perform the stream thinning, the basic operation
   of adaptation (or stream thinning) is improved to avoid full RTP
   packet removing.

   When an MANE finds a full RTP packet needs to be removed, it replaces
   the RTP packet with a dummy RTP packet instead of removing it at all.
   It means that the dummy RTP packet contains the same RTP header as
   the original RTP packet and includes a single empty NAL unit.  When
   MANEs find that part of a RTP packet (i.e. one or more NAL units)
   needs to be removed the operation of stream thinning remain the same
   as today.  As empty NAL unit is only defined for MST mode today
   [RFC6190], this document extends the usage of empty NAL units to SST
   mode.


4.  Use of ECN with RTP/UDP/IP for SVC and MVC

   In this section, the solutions of this document are described in
   details.  Below, behaviour of different network elements are
   described in separate subsections.

4.1.  Setting ECN-CE within an RTP Session

   In this subsection, the behaviour of the routers or other network
   elements with ECN functionality in the video stream transmission path
   are defined.

   A router could decide to select more than one enhancement layers or
   non-base views to set the CE codepoint.  This method can trigger
   multiple different congestion events.

   For each selected layer or non-base view, one router could set the CE
   codepoint for more than one IP packet.  Especially for routers or
   network elements within radio network, we recommend setting two or
   three packets in the time order for each selected layer or non-base
   view to avoid packet loss due to the time-varying of wireless
   channel.

4.2.  Reporting ECN Feedback via RTCP

   In this subsection, the behaviour of the receivers are defined.

   When receiving the dummy RTP packets, the receiver records the IP and
   RTP header for future ECN usage and does not use them for video
   decoding.  The receiver should counter the dummy RTP packets when
   calculates the parameters of the ECN reports.  Especially, the dummy
   RTP packets should be countered into the parameter of "ECT(0)
   Counter", "ECT(1) Counter", "ECN-CE Counter" and "Lost Packets
   Counter".

   An immediate or early (depending on the RTP/AVPF mode defined in
   [RFC4585]) ECN feedback report should be generated on receipt of the
   first ECN-CE marked packet.  The early ECN feedback report metioned
   in this document complies with the available IETF mechanism.

   For each new received ECN-CE marked packet, the receiver shall
   determine whether the new arriving packet belongs to an existing
   congestion event or is a new congestion event.  The receiver only
   needs to generate ECN feedback reports for new congestion events to
   avoid unnecessary ECN feedback reports.  The principles are:

   a.  The receivers always treat different ECN-CE marked packet of
       different layers or non-base view as different congestion events.

   b.  For the ECN-CE marked packets of the same layer or the same non-
       base view, the receiver calculates the reception time of the new
       arriving ECN- CE marked packet, i.e.  T_new.  It compares the
       T_new with the reception time of the previous arrived ECN-CE
       marked packet i.e.  T_old.  If the T_new < T_old + RTT, then the

       new arriving ECN-CE marked packet is considered to belong to the
       same congestion event.  Otherwise, it is considered as a new
       congestion event.  T_odd is the reception time of a previous
       ECN-CE marked packet of the same layer or non-base view.  RTT is
       the Round Trip Time between the RTP sender and the RTP receiver.

4.3.  Response to Congestion Notifications

   In this subsection, the behaviour of the sender is defined.

   Upon receiving ECN feedback reports from the UE, the RTP sender
   inputs the ECN feedback reports into its congestion control or rate
   adaptation algorithms and acts as if packet loss is detected.

   With multiple ECN feedback reports for the same RTP packet stream, we
   believe that the RTP sender will get a reference to perform proper
   congestion control or rate adaptation.  More amount of ECN feedback
   reports will contribute to quicker congestion control or rate
   adaptation effect but will bring more quality loss.  The trade-off
   details are algorithm-dependent and are not included in this
   document.
