            Requirements for OSPF Topology-Transparent Zone
                     draft-chen-ospf-ttz-req-00.txt

Abstract

   This document presents a list of requirements for OSPF topology-
   transparent zone in a domain.  A topology-transparent zone comprises
   a group of routers and a number of links connecting these routers.
   Any router outside of the zone is not aware of the zone.  The
   information about the links and routers inside the zone is not
   distributed to any router outside of the zone.  Any link state change
   such as a link down inside the zone is not seen by any router outside
   of the zone.

1.  Introduction

   The number of routers in a network becomes larger and larger as the
   Internet traffic keeps growing.  Through splitting the network into
   multiple areas, we can extend the network further.  However, there
   are a number of issues when a network is split further into more
   areas.

   At first, dividing an AS or an area into multiple areas is a very
   challenging task since it is involved in significant network
   architecture changes.

   Secondly, it is complex for a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switching Path (LSP) crossing multiple
   areas to be setup.  In one option, a TE path crossing multiple areas
   is computed by using collaborating Path Computation Elements (PCEs)
   [RFC5441] through the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP)[RFC5440],
   which is not easy to configure by operators since the manual
   configuration of the sequence of domains is required.  Although this
   issue can be addressed by using the Hierarchical PCE, this solution
   may further increase the complexity of network design.  Especially,
   the current PCE standard method may not guarantee that the path found
   is optimal.

   Furthermore, some policies need to be configured on area border
   routers for reducing the number of link states such as summary Link-
   State Advertisements (LSAs) to be distributed to other routers in
   other areas.

   OSPF topology-transparent zone may resolve the issues above.

   A topology-transparent zone comprises a group of routers and a number
   of links connecting these routers.  Any router outside of the zone is
   not aware of the zone.  The information about the links and routers
   inside the zone is not distributed to any router outside of the zone.
   Any link state change such as a link down inside the zone is not seen
   by any router outside of the zone.

   This document presents requirements for OSPF topology-transparent
   zone.

3.  Requirements

   Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ) may be deployed for resolving some
   critical issues in existing networks and future networks.  The
   requirements for TTZ are listed as follows:

   o  TTZ MUST be backward compatible.  When a TTZ is deployed on a set
      of routers in a network, the routers outside of the TTZ in the
      network do not need to know or support TTZ.

   o  A group of nodes in an existing network SHOULD be able to migrate
      to a TTZ smoothly after the configuration of TTZ on these nodes is
      activated.

   o  All the nodes in an existing TTZ SHOULD be able to migrate back to
      their OSPF area smoothly after the configuration of TTZ on these
      nodes is deleted.

   o  TTZ MUST support at least one more levels of network hierarchies,
      in addition to the hierarchies supported by existing routing
      protocols.

   o  Users SHOULD be able to easily set up an end to end service
      crossing TTZs.

   o  The protections on the service crossing TTZs SHOULD be transparent
      to TTZ.

   o  The configuration for a TTZ in a network SHOULD be minimum.

   o  The changes on the existing protocols for supporting TTZ SHOULD be
      minimum.


4.  Security Considerations

   The mechanism described in this document does not raise any new
   security issues.
