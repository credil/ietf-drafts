           OSPF Extensions for MPLS Green Traffic Engineering
                     draft-li-ospf-ext-green-te-01

Abstract

   The energy-saving is one important topic in the world, and now most
   of technologies for energy-saving focus on the hardware design
   instead of the energy saving design based on the whole network.  This
   document proposes OSPF extensions to synchronize the energy
   consumption parameter of each node in the network.  These parameters
   can be used for the energy saving design.

1.  Introduction

   Energy-saving has become a global topic.  Network equipments consume
   a lot of energy which has to be saved as the data forwarding is not
   affected.

   Energy-saving design of networks includes a number of aspects: on the
   one hand, the energy-saving design of the device hardware should be
   considered, such as the use of low energy consumption elements for
   hardware design, or, the use of digital power to improve power
   efficiency.  On the other hand, the energy-efficient design in the
   planning of the network should be considered so that forwarding paths
   can choose the path of least power consumption for traffic
   forwarding.  The document focuses on energy-saving based on the whole
   network.  The energy-saving design of the hardware is out of scope of
   the document.

   MPLS TE, a very popular technology in existing networks, concerns
   about the overall network performance optimization to provide
   efficient and reliable network services to optimize the use of
   network resources and optimize network traffic.  MPLS TE can also
   provide resource reservation so that the operator can precisely
   control the traffic paths to avoid the congested nodes and provide
   better QoS.  As the SDN solution develop, the MPLS TE LSP path can be
   calculated in a central controller to achieve better path

   optimization result based on more information collected and the
   states of all LSPs in the network.

   However, the energy consumption of the device and link is not
   considered in the MPLS path calculation.  Therefore, this document
   describes an optimization of MPLS TE by considering the energy
   consumption parameters of the device in the calculation of the
   forwarding path, in ensuring the normal forwarding of the user
   traffic in the premise, and to reduce the energy consumption of the
   entire network.

2.  Overview of MPLS Green Traffic Engineering

   In order to support energy-saving in MPLS TE, following functions
   have to be supported in each node of one network:

   1.  Each node in network should have its own energy-saving design in
   physical level.

   2.  Energy-related parameters of the device and the link should be
   able to be determined by each node in the network.

   3.  IGP extension should be proposed to flood all these parameters
   within the MPLS TE domain.

   4.  Algorithms should be extended to consider these energy-related
   parameters to calculate paths with the power consumption constraint.

3.  Energy-saving Design of Network Nodes

   The goal of this document is about the design of the network-level
   energy-saving, but energy-saving design of each device in the network
   is still very important.  It is the basis for the energy saving of
   the network.  Without the energy-saving design of the network nodes,
   it is difficult to achieve the energy-saving of the whole network.

4.  Parameters of Energy-saving Design

   In MPLS green traffic engineering, following parameters should be
   handled at first:

   1.  The energy consumption of link:

   The power consumption of each device is generally composed of two
   parts: the basis of power consumption and the changes of power
   consumption.  The basis of power consumption is the fixed energy
   consumption, including fan.  The changes of power consumption mainly
   depends on the forwarding process of increased and decreased traffic.

   This information can be carried in the link states of OSPF, called as
   "Energy consumption of Link TLV".

5.  OSPF Extensions

5.1.  Energy consumption of Link TLV

   [RFC3630] and [RFC5786] define extensions of OSPF to support MPLS TE.
   New TLVs should be added to OSPF TE LSAs to support MPLS green TE.

   Energy consumption of Link TLV:

   The "Energy consumption of Link TLV" will be represented as one
   expended sub-TLV of link-TLV.  And the type of this sub-TLV is TBD,
   and its length is 4, and it is used to represent the energy will be
   consumed by the link which unit is Watts.

   than those discussed in [RFC3630] and [RFC5786].
