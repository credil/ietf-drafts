                Echo Relay Reply mechanism for LSP Ping
                draft-zjns-mpls-lsp-ping-relay-reply-00

Abstract

   [RFC4379] describes the LSP Ping mechanism to detect data plane
   failures.  In some deployment scenario for the LSP traceroute, a
   replying LSR may not have the available route to the initiator, and
   the echo reply message sent to the initiator would be discarded.
   Thus, the basic idea of traceroute procedure to localize fault could
   not be achieved.  This document describes extensions to LSP Ping
   mechanism to enable the replying LSR to have the capability to relay
   the echo reply by a set of routable intermediate nodes to the
   initiator.

Internet-Draft          MPLS LSP Ping relay reply              June 2012


1.  Introduction

   This draft describes LSP Ping Echo Relay Reply mechanism that can be
   used to detect data plane failures in MPLS LSPs that span across
   multiple domains.  A new message referred to as "Echo Relay Reply
   message" and a new TLV referred to as "Relay Node Address Stack TLV"
   are defined in this draft.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Motivation

   LSP Ping is an efficient OAM mechanism to detect data plane failures
   and localize faults.  The basic LSP Ping mechanism has been described
   in [RFC4379].  In traceroute mode of LSP Ping procedure, the echo
   request message is sent to the control plane of each transit LSR, and
   an echo reply massage with proper information are required to send to
   the initiator at each transit LSR.  Then the LSP fault could be
   localized exactly, and an accurate LSP topology could also be built.

   The echo reply would normally be sent back to the initiator via an
   IPv4/IPv6 UDP packet.  The basic requirement is that the replying LSR
   has reachable IP route to the initiator.  However, in some network
   deployment, the requirement could not be met because of the route
   control policy.

   For inter-AS scenarios, it is common of the providers to NOT
   distribute the IP addresses of any of the nodes other than the ASBR.
   If initiating a traceroute procedure on the ingress node PE1 of an
   LSP from PE1 to PE2, P nodes in the other AS like P2 would be unable
   to respond to the echo request message for the lack of IP reachable
   route to PE1.

   For the inter-area situation in Seamless MPLS architecture [ietf-
   mpls-seamless], P nodes in core network would not have IP reachable
   route to ANs.  When tracing an LSP from AN to remote AN, the LSR1/
   LSR2 node could not make a response to the echo request either, like
   P2 node in the inter-AS scenario.

   This draft describes extensions to LSP Ping mechanism to enable the
   response from the replying LSR to be relayed back to the initiator.
   The replying LSR would send the response to a relay node indicated by
   the Relay Node Address Stack TLV, and the response would be relayed
   to the next relay node, till to the initiator.


3.  Extensions

   RFC4379 describes the basic MPLS LSP Ping mechanism, which defines
   two message types.  This draft defines a new message, Echo Relay
   Reply message.  This new message is used to replace Echo Reply
   message which is sent from the replying LSR to a relay node or from a
   relay node to another relay node.

   In addition, a new TLV named Relay Node Address Stack TLV is defined
   in this draft, to carry the IP addresses of the possible relay nodes
   for the replying LSR.

3.1.  Echo Relay Reply message

   The echo relay reply message is a UDP packet, and the UDP payload has
   the same format with echo request/reply message.  A new message type
   is requested from IANA.

   echo reply and echo relay reply messages if the echo reply relayed
   mechanism described in this draft is required.

   If the K bit is set to 1, then this sub-TLV SHOULD be kept in Relay
   Node Address Stack, SHOULD not be deleted in compress process of
   section 4.2.  The K bit may be set by ASBRs which address would be
   kept in the stack if necessary.

   If the K bit is set to 0, then this sub-TLV SHOULD be processed
   normally according to section 4.2.

   Relayed Address: This field specifies the node address, either IPv4
   or IPv6.


4.  Procedures

4.1.  Sending an Echo Request

   The procedures described in Section 4.3 of RFC4379 apply here.  In
   addition, An Relay Node Address Stack TLV MUST be carried in the echo
   request message.

   When the echo request is first sent by initiator, a Relay Node
   Address Stack TLV with the initiator address in the stack and its
   source port MUST be included.

   For the subsequent echo request messages, the initiator would copy
   the Relay Node Address Stack TLV from the received echo reply
   message.

4.2.  Receiving an Echo Request

   In addition to the processes in Section 4.4 of RFC4379, the
   procedures of the Relay Node Address Stack TLV are defined here.

   Upon receiving a Relay Node Address Stack TLV of the echo request



Zheng, et al.           Expires December 18, 2012               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          MPLS LSP Ping relay reply              June 2012


   message, the receiver would check the addresses of the stack in
   sequence from top to bottom, to find out the first public routable IP
   address.  Those address entries behind of the first routable IP
   address in the address list with K bit set to 0 would be deleted, and
   the address entry of the replying LSR would be added at the bottom of
   the stack.  Those address entries with K bit set to 1 would be kept
   in the stack.  The updated Relay Node Address Stack TLV would be
   carried in the response message.

   If the replying LSR wishes to hide its routable address information,
   the address entry added in the stack would be a blank entry with
   Address Type set to Unspecified.  The blank address entry in the
   receiving echo request would be treated as an unroutable address
   entry.

   If the first routable IP address is the first address in the stack,
   the replying LSR would respond an echo reply message to the
   initiator.

   If the first routable IP address is of an intermediate node, other
   than the first address in the stack, the replying LSR would send an
   echo relay reply instead of an echo reply in response.

4.3.  Sending an Echo Relay Reply

   The echo relay reply is sent in two cases:

   1.  When the replying LSR received an echo request with the initiator
   IP address in the Relay Node Address Stack TLV is IP unroutable, the
   replying LSR would send an echo relay reply message to the first
   routable intermediate node.  The encapsulation processing of echo
   relay reply is the same with the procedure of the echo reply
   described in Section 4.5 of RFC4379, except the destination IP
   address and the destination UDP port of the message part.  The
   destination IP address of the echo relay reply is set to the first
   routable IP address from the Relay Node Address Stack TLV, and the
   destination UDP port is set to 3503.

   2.  When the intermediate relay node received an echo relay reply
   with the initiator IP address in the Relay Node Address Stack TLV is
   IP unroutable, the intermediate relay node would send the echo relay
   reply to the next relay node with the content of the UDP packet
   unchanged.  The destination IP address of the echo relay reply is set
   to the first routable IP address from the Relay Node Address Stack
   TLV.  Both the source and destination UDP port should be 3503.

Internet-Draft          MPLS LSP Ping relay reply              June 2012


4.4.  Receiving an Echo Relay Reply

   Upon receiving an echo relay reply message with its address as the
   destination address in the IP header, the relay node should check the
   address items in Relay Node Address Stack TLV in sequence and find
   the first routable node address.

   If the first routable address is the top one of the address list,
   i.e., the initiator address, the relay node should send an echo reply
   message to the initiator containing the same payload with the echo
   relay reply message received.

   If the first routable address is not the top one of the address list,
   i.e., another intermediate relay node, the relay node should send an
   echo relay reply message to this relay node with the payload
   unchanged.

4.5.  Sending an Echo Reply

   The echo relay reply is sent in two cases:

   1.  When the replying LSR received an echo request with the initiator
   IP address in the Relay Node Address Stack TLV is IP routable, the
   replying LSR would send an echo reply to the initiator.  The
   processing of echo relay reply is the same with the procedure of the
   echo reply described in Section 4.5 of RFC4379.

   2.  When the intermediate relay node LSR received an echo relay reply
   with the initiator IP address in the Relay Node Address Stack TLV is
   IP routable, the intermediate relay node would send the echo reply to
   the initiator with the payload no changes other than the Message Type
   field.  The destination IP address of the echo reply is set to the
   initiator IP address, and the destination UDP port would be copied
   from the Initiator Source Port field of the Relay Node Address Stack
   TLV.  The source UDP port should be 3503.

4.6.  Receiving an Echo Reply

   In addition to the processes in Section 4.6 of RFC4379, the initiator
   would copy the Relay Node Address Stack TLV received in the echo
   reply to the next echo request.


5.  Security Considerations

   In addition to the Security Consideration from [RFC4379], to avoid
   potential Denial-of-service attack, it is RECOMMENED that
   implementations regulate the LSP Ping traffic going to the control

   plane.  A rate limiter SHOULD be applied to UDP port 3503 of the
   intermediate node.

   The node which acts as a relay node SHOULD validate the relay reply
   against a set of valid source addresses.  An implementation SHOULD
   provide such filtering capabilities.

   If an operator wants to obscure their nodes, then a blank entry may
   be used in the address stack.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign one new Message Type and one new TLV

6.1.  New Message Type

   New Message Type:
        Value    Meaning
        -----    -------
        TBD      MPLS echo relay reply

6.2.  New TLV

   New TLV: Routable Relay Node Address TLV
