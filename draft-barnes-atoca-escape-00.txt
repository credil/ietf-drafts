       Encoding of Secure Common Alert Protocol Entities (ESCAPE)
                    draft-barnes-atoca-escape-00.txt

Abstract

   Recipients of emergency alerts need to be able to verify that an
   alert they receive was issued by an authorized source.  The Common
   Alerting Protocol (CAP) provides a standard way of encoding alert
   information, but does not provide any security features that would
   support authentication of alert originators.  This document describes
   a security wrapper for Common Alerting Protocol objects to allow
   alerts to be signed by alert originators.

   Please send feedback to the atoca@ietf.org mailing list.

1.  Introduction

   Emergency alerting is an increasingly important function of
   telecommunications networks, allowing authorities to distribute
   warnings of impending danger to large numbers of end users in a short
   period of time.  However, because emergency alerts are such important
   messages to users, there is much more potential for abuse of alerting
   than other messaging systems.  If an attacker can introduce a false
   emergency alert, he may be able to cause mass action, such as the
   evacuation of a building or city.

   Traditionally, the security of alerting systems has been based mainly
   on the security of the system by which authorities provide alerts to
   broadcast points, and on the link-layer security of broadcast media
   that deliver alerts to end users.  In the context of the Internet, it
   is impossible to rely on link-layer security because IP runs over
   many types of link that have no analogous access control.  While it
   is still important for the "staging" or "distribution" step be
   secure, the alerting system would be more robust if security were
   provided end-to-end, from the original authority to the end
   recipient.

   This document describes ESCAPE, a secure container format for the
   Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) [CAP].  CAP documents provide
   information about an emergency alert; ESCAPE-wrapped CAP documents
   also provide security information that can authenticate the
   originator of the alert.  Using this additional information, end
   alert recipients can verify that ESCAPE-wrapped alerts were
   originated by entities they trust, and reject false alerts from
   untrusted entities.

   The ESCAPE format defines only a mechanism for signing alerts.  It
   does not define how an alert recipient discovers public keys for
   entities that it should trust to originate alerts, such as local
   network operators or local alert authorities.  This document assumes
   that cryptographic parameters such as public keys and "alert tokens"
   have been provisioned through some other mechanism, e.g., [ATOCA-DOC-
   TBD].

1.1.  Open Questions

   Should we always apply GZIP to the entire encoded message?  Pro:
   Slightly smaller message size.  Con: Will need to require GZIP for
   all messages or add content indication.

   Should we allow DER-encoded CAP as well as XML-encoded CAP?  Pro:
   Smaller message size.  Con: Clients need to support two encodings.

   Should we constrain crypto algorithms.  Pro: Marginally simpler
   implementation.  Con: Need to maintain a list of supported
   algorithms.

   Should we require a public-key signature, or allow reliance on token
   checks alone?  Pro: Enables cases with no public-key operations.
   Con: Risk of replay attacks using old tokens.

   Should we move the Alert-Token field from the inner (signed) MIME
   entity to the outer (unsigned) MIME entity?  Pro: Allows relays to
   add tokens.  Con: Allows relays and attackers to remove or change
   tokens.


2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  new section

   The ESCAPE format encapsulates a CAP document as an S/MIME object
   [RFC5751].  First, the CAP document is encoded as a MIME entity
   [RFC2045], then the MIME entity is signed using S/MIME.

3.1.  Basic MIME encoding

   CAP XML documents have MIME type "application/cap+xml".  An alert
   originator may choose to apply the gzip compression scheme to the
   alert before sending it.  If the alert is compressed, the originator
   must encode the compressed alert using the base64 encoding scheme
   before transmitting it [RFC1952][RFC4648].  A CAP MIME body thus has
   the following properties:

   o  A "Content-Type" header field MUST be present, with the single
      value "application/cap+xml".

   o  A "Content-Encoding" header field MAY be present.  If present, it
      MUST have the value "gzip", and there MUST be a "Content-Transfer-
      Encoding" header with the value "base64".

   o  The body of the MIME entity MUST be a CAP document, either
      directly, or processed through the gzip and base64 encodings.

3.2.  Alert Tokens

   ESCAPE introduces a new MIME header, Alert-Token, which provides a
   rough form of authentication.  If alert recipients are configured
   with a list of valid tokens (or an algorithm for checkign the
   validity of a token), the recipient of an alert message can check the
   validity of the value in the Alert-Token field before performing full
   S/MIME validation on the ESCAPE object.  The Alert-Token field
   contains a single opaque binary string, encoded in base64.  The ABNF
   syntax for the field is as follows, where "base64" is as defined in
   RFC 4566 [RFC4566][RFC2234].  (Here we also follow the usual
   conventions with regard to whitespace in MIME headers.)
   Alert-Token = "Alert-Token" ":" base64


   An ESCAPE MIME entity MAY contain one or more Alert-Token header
   fields.  Any header fields other than "Content-Type", "Content-
   Encoding", "Content-Transfer-Encoding", and "Alert-Token" MAY be
   ignored by alert recipients.

3.3.  S/MIME Encapsulation

   After a CAP message has been encoded into a MIME entity, an S/MIME
   signature is applied, following the S/MIME procedures for
   constructing a signed message of type "multipart/signed" (Section 3.4
   of RFC 5751 [RFC5751]).  The following constraints apply to the
   S/MIME encoding used in ESCAPE messages.

   o  The ESCAPE message MUST have type "multipart/signed".

   o  If the ESCAPE message contains header fields other than "Content-
      Type", then they MAY be ignored.

   o  The S/MIME body part SHOULD NOT include certificates for signers,
      in order to minimize message size.

   o  The S/MIME body part SHOULD identify signers by subject key
      identifier rather than by subject name, in order to allow for both
      certified and uncertified public keys [RFC5652].

   Except the constraints above, software to verify ESCAPE alerts MUST
   include full S/MIME support, including all defined cryptographic
   algorithms [RFC3370][RFC5754].  Implementations MAY include
   additional algorithms, but alert signers SHOULD NOT sign alerts with
   non-standard algorithms, since some recipients may not be able to
   process them.

3.4.  Validity

   An ESCAPE object is valid if and only if all of the following
   conditions are true:

   o  If the verifying entity is configured with valid tokens, then
      there must be at least one Alert-Token header field containing a
      valid token.

   o  If the verifying entity is configured with trusted public keys,
      then the S/MIME signature on the object must be valid, and must be
      verified using a trusted public key.

   An entity verifying an ESCAPE object MUST verify both of these
   criteria, but MAY check them in either order and omit further checks
   after the object fails one check.  In particular, performing the
   token check before decoding and verifying the CMS signature may avoid
   the work of signature verification.  A verifying entity SHOULD NOT
   accept ESCAPE objects if it is configured with neither trusted public
   keys nor valid tokens.


4.  Processing Rules

   There are three main phases in the life-cycle of an ESCAPE object.
   First, it is created and signed by an alert originator.  Second, it
   may pass through an alert relay that adds a signature under its key.
   Finally, it is received and verified by an end recipient.  This
   section describes the steps that each type of entity follows to sign,
   re-sign or verify an ESCAPE object.

4.1.  Alert Originator (Signer)

   Inputs:

   o  CAP document

   o  Private key for signing and corresponding subject key ID

   o  gzip flag

   o  List of tokens (possibly empty)

   Processing steps:

   1.  Encode the CAP document as a MIME entity.

Internet-Draft                   ESCAPE                     October 2011


       A.  Add a "Content-Type" header field with value "application/
           common-application-protocol+xml".

       B.  If the gzip flag is set, add a "Content-Encoding" header
           field with value "gzip" and a "Content-Transfer-Encoding"
           header field with value "base64".

       C.  Add an "Access-Token" header field for each token in the
           list.

       D.  If the gzip flag is set, gzip the CAP document, then gzip and
           base64-encode the CAP document and set it as the message
           body.

       E.  If the gzip flag is not set, set the CAP document as the
           message body.

   2.  Compute the signature over the MIME entity using the signing key
       and create a CMS SignedData structure that identifies the signer
       using the corresponding subject key ID.

   3.  Combine the CAP MIME entity and the computed CMS SignedData
       structure into a "multipart/signed" S/MIME object.

   Output: ESCAPE message

4.2.  Alert Relay (Re-signer)

   Inputs:

   o  ESCAPE object

   o  Private key for signing and corresponding subject key ID

   Processing steps:

   1.  Extract the CAP MIME entity and CMS SignedData object from the
       ESCAPE message.

   2.  Compute the signature over the CAP MIME entity using the signing
       key.

   3.  Append the signature value and subject key ID to the CMS
       SignedData object as a new SignerInfo.

   4.  Combine the CAP MIME entity and the computed CMS SignedData
       structure into a "multipart/signed" S/MIME object.

   Output: ESCAPE message

4.3.  Alert Recipient (Verifier)

   Inputs:

   o  ESCAPE object

   o  Set of trusted public keys (possibly empty)

   o  Set of valid tokens (possibly empty)

   Processing steps:

   1.

   2.  Extract the CAP MIME entity and the CMS SignedData object from
       the ESCAPE message.

   3.  Check that the MIME headers for the CAP MIME entity have the
       correct values.

       *  Content-Type must be "application/
          common-alerting-protocol+xml"

       *  Content-Encoding must be "gzip" or absent

       *  Content-Transfer-Encoding must be present and equal to
          "base64" if Content-Encoding is present, otherwise absent.

       If any of these headers are invalid, then return the CAP message
       is malformed.  Return FALSE.

   4.  Extract the CAP entity body.  If the Content-Encoding is "gzip",
       then base64-decode and un-gzip the CAP entity body.

   5.  If the set of valid tokens is non-empty, then verify that at
       least one of the Alert-Token values in the CAP MIME entity is
       contained within the set of valid tokens.  If no Alert-Token
       value is valid, then return FALSE.

   6.  If the set of trusted public keys is non-empty, then verify that
       at least one of the SignerInfos within the CMS SignedData object
       contains a valid signature under a trusted key.  If no valid,
       trusted signature is found, then return FALSE.

   7.  Return TRUE.
