             MAC-Forced Forwarding Inter-operates with VEPA
             draft-zhang-mac-forced-forwarding-vepa-00.txt

Abstract

   MAC Forced Forwarding discards ARPing messages exchanged within a
   Customer Premises Network (CPN). When Virtual Ethernet Port
   Aggregator (VEPA) is deployed in the CPN, this kind of discarding may
   cause a connectivity problem. 

   This document analyzes the cause of this connectivity problem and
   suggests interfaces should be classified to avoid the this problem.

INTERNET-DRAFT        MAC-Forced Forwarding & VEPA      October 15, 2012


1. Introduction

   MAC Forced Forwarding (MFF) is defined in RFC 4562. MFF does not
   reply an ARP request destined to a VM located in the same Customer
   Premises Network (CPN). Because it is assumed that this ARP request
   should have been replied within the CPN. However, this mechanism does
   not work any more when Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator (VEPA) is
   used in the CPN.

   According to 802.1Qbg, when VEPA is used on servers, upstream frames
   via the same interface may come from different customers or different
   subnet from a same customer. All ARPing messages will be output to
   the external switch via this interface. The ARP request should also
   be replied by the ARP proxy by this external switch (i.e., the
   Ethernet Access Node, see RFC 4562), or else the VMs connected by
   this VEPA will be disconnected.

   This document defines separated user interface for VEPA. ARP request
   received via this kind of interface should never be discarded. The
   EAN's ARP proxy MUST reply to it with the MAC address of the target
   AR.

1.1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2. Terminology

   VM: Virtual Machine
   VEPA: Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator
   MFF: The MAC Forced Forwarding technique provided in RFC 4562

2. Customer Premises Networks Deploy VEPA

   A Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator (VEPA) outputs switching traffic
   to external switches (EANs) and EANs provide layer 2 connectivity for
   VMs. Customer Premises Networks may deploy VEPA therefore the Access
   Control List, Quality of Service, security and filtering can be
   performed on the external switch. This kind of offloading also frees
   up servers' resources cost by the switching function.

   The following two section list the connectivity issues that may
   happen when VEPA is deployed in Customer Premises Networks.

          Figure 2.1: VEPA is deployed on the subscriber line.

2.1. Intercommunication Between Customers

   For a VM located in a different CPN, when ARP request are sent to
   query this its MAC address, the EAN's ARP proxy will reply the
   request with the MAC address of an AR.

   When VEPA is deployed on Customer Premises servers, multiple CPNs may
   share the same subscribe line to send upstream traffic and
   communicate with each other [802.1Qbg]. Therefore an ARP request may
   need be answered by another VM within another CPN connected by the
   same subscribe line.  

   According to RFC 4562, EANs never answer an ARP request message via
   the same interface where it is received. MFF takes it for granted
   that the ARP request for a VM connected by the same subscribe line
   should be answered by the target host. Therefore, the EAN will
   discard the ARPing messages directly. Thus these VMs will be wrongly
   disconnected.

   In Figure 2.1, the subscriber line attached to the interface (2)
   faces the above problem.

2.2. VMs from the Same Customer

   Without VEPA, for VMs from the same customer premises network, an ARP
   request to a target VM is assumed to be directly answered by this VM
   within the premises network. Therefore the attached EAN SHOULD
   discard this ARP request [RFC 4562]. 

   However, when VEPA is deployed, the ARP request will not be answered
   within the customer premises network. VEPA will output the ARPing to
   the external switch. If the EAN discard the ARPing messages received
   from the subscriber line, VMs of this CPN will be disconnected.

   In Figure 2.1, the subscriber line attached to the interface (7)
   faces the above problem.

3. Interface Classification

   In order to solve the connectivity issues described in Section 2,
   EANs should answer all ARP requests got from a subscriber line when
   VEPA is used on this line. In this section, interfaces of EANs are
   classified into three categories: network interface, normal user
   interface and separated user interface.

3.1. Network Interface

   The interface where an EAN is connected to ARs is called the network
   interface.

   In Figure 2.1, interface (1) (3) (6) are network interfaces.

3.2. Normal User Interface

   By default, the interface attached to a subscriber line will be set
   to normal user interface. Legacy MAC Forced Forwarding rules applies
   on this kind of interface.

   In Figure 2.1, interfaces (4) and (5) are the normal user interfaces.

3.3. Separated User Interface

   When VEPA is used on a subscriber line, the interface SHOULD be set
   to separated user interface. EANs MUST use ARP proxy to reply ARP
   requests received via this kind of interface.

   In Figure 2.1, interfaces (2) and (7) are the separated user
   interfaces.

4. Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues.
