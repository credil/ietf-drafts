                   Service Selection for Mobile IPv6
                draft-korhonen-netext-rfc5149bis-02.txt

Abstract

   In some Mobile IPv6 deployments, identifying the mobile node or the
   mobility service subscriber is not enough to distinguish between
   multiple services possibly provisioned to the said mobile node and
   its mobility service subscription.  A capability to specify different
   services in addition to the mobile node identity can be leveraged to
   provide flexibility for mobility service providers on provisioning
   multiple services to one mobility service subscription.  This
   document describes a Service Selection Mobility Option for both
   conventional Mobile IPv6 and Proxy Mobile IPv6 that is intended to
   assist home agents and local mobility agents to make a specific
   service selection for the mobility service subscription during the
   binding registration procedure.  This specification updates RFC5213
   and obsoletes RFC5149.

Internet-Draft              Service Selection                 March 2012


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275] can identify mobile nodes in various ways,
   including home addresses, Network Access Identifiers (NAIs)
   [RFC4282][RFC4283], and credentials suitable for the Internet Key
   Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC4877].  Proxy Mobile IPv6
   [RFC5213] uses Home Network Prefix (HNP) and/or Mobile Node
   Identifier [RFC4283].  In some Mobile IPv6 deployments, identifying
   the mobile node or the mobility service subscriber via a Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 client [RFC5213] (hereafter, the mobile node and the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 client are used interchangeably) is not enough to
   distinguish between multiple services possibly provisioned to the
   said mobile node and its mobility service subscription.

   The capability to specify different services in addition to the
   mobile node identity can be leveraged to provide flexibility for
   mobility service providers to provide multiple services within the
   same mobility service subscription.  For example:

   o  Provide an enterprise data access for which the mobility service
      provider hosts connectivity and mobility services on behalf of the
      enterprise.

   o  Provide access to service domains that are otherwise not
      accessible from public networks because of some mobility service
      provider's business reasons.

   o  Provide simultaneous access to different service domains that are
      separated based on policies of the mobility service provider.

   o  Enable easier policy and quality of service assignment for
      mobility service providers based on the subscribed services.

   o  In the absence of a specifically indicated service, the home agent
      MUST act as if the default service, plain Internet access, had
      been requested.  There is no absolute requirement that this
      default service be allowed to all subscribers, but it is highly
      RECOMMENDED in order to avoid having normal subscribers employ
      operator-specific configuration values in order to get basic
      service.

   This document describes a Service Selection Mobility Option for
   (Proxy) Mobile IPv6 that is intended to assist home agents or local
   mobility agents to make specific service selections for the mobility
   service subscription during the binding registration procedure.  The
   service selection MAY affect home agent or local mobility agent
   routing decisions, Home Address or Home Network Prefix assignment
   policies, firewall settings, and security policies.  The Service

Internet-Draft              Service Selection                 March 2012


   Selection option SHOULD be used in every Binding Update that makes a
   new registration to the home agent.

   Some of the potential use-cases were listed earlier in this section.
   The general aim is better manageability of services and service
   provisioning from the point of view of both operators and service
   providers.  However, it should be understood that there are potential
   deployment possibilities where selecting a certain service may
   restrict simultaneous access to other services from a user's point of
   view.  For example, services may be located in different
   administrative domains or external customer networks that practice
   excessive filtering of inbound and outbound traffic.

   There are existing deployments using the Service Selection option.
   3GPP PMIPv6-based Evolved Packet Core (EPC) [RFC6459] deployments use
   the Service Selection option to carry the Access Point Name (APN)
   [TS.23003].  Recently, service provider Wi-Fi services over
   residential architectures [I-D.gundavelli-v6ops-community-wifi-svcs]
   that intend to integrate into e.g., 3GPP EPC using PMIPv6, need
   Service Selection option again to carry the APN information for
   identifying a particular routing domain.


2.  Service Selection Mobility Option

   At most one Service Selection Mobility option SHOULD be included in
   any (Proxy) Binding Update message.  If and only if the (Proxy)
   Binding Update message included the Service Selection Option, then
   the corresponding (Proxy) Binding Acknowledgement message SHOULD also
   contain the Service Selection option with the service name in the
   Identifier (see Note #1 in Appendix A.1).

   If the (Proxy) Binding Update message includes any authorization-
   related options (such as the Binding Authorization Data option
   [RFC6275]) or authentication related options (such as the Mobility
   Message Authentication option [RFC4285]), then the Service Selection
   option MUST appear before any mobility message authorization- or
   authentication-related options.

   The Service Selection option SHOULD NOT be sent to a correspondent
   node.  The mobile node cannot assume that the correspondent node has
   any knowledge about a specific service selection made between the
   mobile node and the home agent.

   The Service Selection option has no alignment requirement as such.

   o  Type: 8-bit identifier set to 20 of the type of the skipable
      mobility option.

   o  Length: 8-bit unsigned integer, representing the length of the
      Service Selection Mobility Option in octets, excluding the Option
      Type and Option Length fields.  A value of zero (0) is not
      allowed.

   o  Identifier: A variable-length encoded service identifier string
      used to identify the requested service.  The identifier string
      length is between 1 and 255 octets.  This specification allows
      international identifier strings that are based on the use of
      Unicode characters, encoded as UTF-8 [RFC3269], and formatted
      using Normalization Form KC (NFKC) as specified in [NFKC] (see
      Note #2 in Appendix A.2).

      'ims', 'voip', and 'voip.companyxyz.example.com' are valid
      examples of Service Selection option Identifiers.  At minimum, the
      Identifier MUST be unique among the home agents to which the
      mobile node is authorized to register.


3.  Processing Considerations

3.1.  Binding Cache Entry Lookup Considerations

   Section 5.4.1 of [RFC5213] describes various Binding Cache Entry
   (BCE) lookup variations in the local mobility agent.  Some existing
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployments have added the Service Selection option
   as one of the used BCE lookup keys (see Note #3 in Appendix A.3).
   This implies that the Service Selection option SHOULD be included in
   all Proxy Binding Update messages, especially when the Home Network
   Prefix is not readily available.

3.2.  Mobile Node Considerations

   A mobile node or a Proxy Mobile IPv6 client MAY include, at most, one
   Service Selection Mobility Option into a (Proxy) Binding Update



Korhonen, et al.       Expires September 13, 2012               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              Service Selection                 March 2012


   message.  The option is used to identify the service to be associated
   with the binding registration and SHOULD only be included into the
   initial Binding Update message sent to a home agent.  If the mobile
   node wishes to change the selected service, it is RECOMMENDED that
   the mobile node de-register the existing binding with the home agent
   before proceeding with a binding registration for a different
   service.  The provisioning of the service identifiers to the mobile
   node or to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 client is out of the scope of this
   specification.

   The placement of the Service Selection option is as follows: when
   present, this option MUST appear after the Mobile Node-Network Access
   Identifier (MN-NAI) option, if the MN-NAI option is present, and
   before any authorization- and authentication-related options.  The
   Service Selection option can be used with any mobile node
   identification method such as a home address, an MN-NAI, and
   credentials suitable for IKEv2.

   If the mobile node receives a (Proxy) Binding Acknowledgement with a
   Status Code set to SERVICE_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED and the mobile node
   has an existing binding with the Home Address or the Home Network
   Prefix used in the failed (Proxy) Binding Update message, the mobile
   node MUST delete the existing binding.  If there is no existing
   binding, the mobile node proceeds as with any failed initial binding
   registration.

   If the mobile node receives a (Proxy) Binding Acknowledgement with a
   Status Code set to MISSING_OR_UNKNOWN_SERVICE the mobile node
   proceeds as with any failed initial binding registration.  The mobile
   node SHOULD log the event as it is usually an indication of a
   configuration error.

3.3.  Home Agent and Local Mobility Agent Considerations

   Upon receiving a (Proxy) Binding Update message with a Service
   Selection option, the home agent or the local mobility agent
   authenticates and authorizes the mobile node.  If the home agent or
   the local mobility anchor supports the Service Selection and the
   Service Selection is required by the local policy, the home agent or
   the local mobility anchor MUST also verify that the mobile node is
   authorized for the service it included in the Service Selection
   option.  The services the mobile node is authorized for SHOULD be
   part of the general mobile node subscription profile.  If the mobile
   node is not authorized for the service, the home agent or the local
   mobility agent MUST deny the registration and send a (Proxy) Binding
   Acknowledgement with a Status Code set to
   SERVICE_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (151).  If the (Proxy) Binding Update
   does not contain the Service Selection option or the indicated



Korhonen, et al.       Expires September 13, 2012               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              Service Selection                 March 2012


   service is unknown, the home agent or the local mobility agent SHOULD
   deny the registration and send a (Proxy) Binding Acknowledgement with
   a Status Code set to MISSING_OR_UNKNOWN_SERVICE (TBD) (see Note #4 in
   Appendix A.4).

   If binding registration was successful in the home agent or the local
   mobility agent, then the (Proxy) Binding Acknowledgement SHOULD
   contain the Service Selection option with the service name in the
   Identifier.

   The Service Selection option is used to assist the authorization and
   identifies a specific service that is to be authorized.  The Service
   Selection option MAY also affect the Home Address or the Home Network
   Prefix allocation when, for example, used with the MN-NAI option.
   For example, for the same NAI there MAY be different Home Addresses
   or Home Network Prefixes depending on the identified service.
   Furthermore, the Service Selection option MAY also affect the routing
   of the outbound IP packets in the home agent or the local mobility
   agent depending on the selected service.  The home agent MAY also
   apply different policy or quality of service treatment to traffic
   flows based on the selected service.

   If the newly arrived (Proxy) Binding Update message with a Service
   Selection option indicates a change in the selected service, then the
   home agent MUST re-authorize the mobile node.  Depending on the home
   agent or the local mobility agent policies, the services policies,
   Home Address or Home Network Prefix allocation policies, and the
   subscription policies, the home agent may or may not be able to
   authorize the mobile node to the new service.  For example, the
   existing service and the new service could require different Home
   Network Prefixes.  If the authorization fails, then the home agent or
   the local mobility agent MUST deny the registration, delete any
   binding with the existing Home Address or Home Network Prefix, and
   send a (Proxy) Binding Acknowledgement with a Status Code set to
   SERVICE_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (151).

3.4.  Correspondent Node Considerations

   Unless the correspondent node and the home agent share the same
   knowledge about mobility services, the Service Selection option is
   more or less useless information to the correspondent node.  The
   correspondent node SHOULD silently ignore the Service Selection
   option in this case.

   There are deployment cases where the home agent and a correspondent
   node, for example, belong to the same administrative domain.  In this
   case, it is possible that the correspondent node shares the same
   knowledge of the services as the home agent.  Therefore, the



Korhonen, et al.       Expires September 13, 2012               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              Service Selection                 March 2012


   correspondent node is, for example, able to provide service-based
   traffic handling to mobile nodes.


4.  Security Considerations

   The protection for the Service Selection Mobility Option depends on
   the service that is being identified and eventually selected.  If the
   service selection information should not be revealed on the wire,
   (Proxy) Binding Updates and (Proxy) Binding Acknowledgements should
   use Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] in transport mode
   with a non-null encryption transform to provide message
   confidentiality.


5.  IANA Considerations

   A Mobile IPv6 Mobility Option type has been assigned for the
   following new mobility option from [RFC6275] "Mobility Options"
   registry.  The mobility option is defined in Section 2:

      Service Selection Mobility Option       is set to 20

   A Mobile IPv6 registration denied by home agent Status Code has been
   assigned.  The Status Code was allocated from the range 128-255:

      SERVICE_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED            is set to 151
      MISSING_OR_UNKNOWN_SERVICE              is set to TBD

A.1.  Note #1

   3GPP EPC PMIPv6-based interfaces echo the Service Selection option
   always back in Proxy Binding Acknowledgements.  This is clarified
   from the RFC5149, which did not say anything about the Service
   Selection option in Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages.

A.2.  Note #2

   3GPP EPC decided to encode their Service Selection Identifiers using
   the [RFC1035] domain name encoding [TS.23003].  Implementations has
   to take this into account when they intend to interoperate with 3GPP
   EPC.

A.3.  Note #3

   3GPP EPC use the Service Selection option as one of the BCE lookup
   keys.  This is additional to what RFC5213 originally defined.

A.4.  Note #4

   RFC5149 did not make a difference between a service authorization
   failure (SERVICE_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED) and a service not being
   provisioned in a home agent/local mobility agent or otherwise unknown
   (MISSING_OR_UNKNOWN_SERVICE).
