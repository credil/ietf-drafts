    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses issues that arise when RTP sessions span
      (UTC) leap seconds. It updates RFC 3550 to describe how RTP senders and
      receivers should behave in the presence of leap seconds.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>In some applications, RTP streams are referenced to a walllock time
      (absolute date and time). This is typically accomplished through use of
      the NTP timestamp field in the RTCP sender report (SR) to create a
      mapping between RTP timestamps and the wallclock. When a wallclock
      reference is used, the playout time for RTP packets is referenced to the
      wallclock. Smooth and continuous media playout requires a smooth and
      continuous timebase. The timebase used by the wallclock may include leap
      seconds which, in many cases, are not rendered smoothly.</t>

      <t>This document provides recommendations for smoothly rendering
      streamed media referenced to common wallclocks which may not have smooth
      or continuous behavior in the presence of leap seconds.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>
      and indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="background" title="Leap seconds">
      <t>Leap seconds are intended to keep UTC time synchronized with the rotation of the earth. Leap seconds are scheduled
      by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service. Leap seconds may be scheduled at the last day of any month but are preferentially scheduled for 
      December and June and secondarily March and September.<xref target="TF.460-6"/> Because earth's rotation is
      unpredictable, leap seconds are typically not scheduled more than six
      months in advance. Leap seconds can be scheduled to either add or remove
      a second from the day. All leap second events thus far have been scheduled in June or December and have all added
      seconds. This is a situation that is expected but not guaranteed to
      continue.</t>

      <t>NOTE- The ITU is studying a proposal which could eventually eliminate
      leap seconds from UTC. As of January 2012, this proposal is expected to
      be decided no earlier than 2015.</t>

      <section anchor="UTC" title="UTC behavior during leap second">
        <t>UTC clocks insert a 61st second at the end of the day when a leap
        second is scheduled. The leap second is designated "23h 59m 60s". The sequence of the second markers near the UTC leap second transition are:
			<list>
				<t>Day 0, 23h 59m 59s</t>
                <t>Day 0, 23h 59m 60s &lt;-- leap second</t>
                <t>Day 1,  0h  0m  0s</t>
			</list>
		</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="NTP" title="NTP behavior during leap second">
        <t>Under NTP <xref target="RFC5905"/> a leap second is inserted at the
        beginning of the last second of the day. This results in the clock
        freezing or slowing for one second immediately prior to the last
        second of the affected day. This results in the last second of the day
        having a real-time duration of two seconds.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="POSIX" title="POSIX behavior during leap second">
        <t>Most POSIX systems insert the leap second at the end of the last
        second of the day. This results in repetition of the last second. A
        timestamp within the last second of the day is therefore ambiguous in
        that it can refer to either of the last two seconds of a day
        containing a leap second.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Recommendations">
      <t>Senders and receivers which are not referenced to a wallclock are not
      affected by issues associated with leap seconds and no special
      accommodation is required.</t>

      <t>RTP implementation using a wallclock reference is simplified by using
      a clock with a timescale which does not include leap seconds. IEEE
      1588 <xref target="IEEE1588-2008"/>, GPS <xref target="IS-GPS-200F"/> and
      other TAI (International Atomic Time) <xref target="CircularT"/>
      references do not include leap seconds. NTP time, operating system
      clocks and other UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) references include
      leap seconds.</t>

      <t>All participants working to a leap-second-bearing reference SHOULD
      recognize leap seconds and have a working communications channel to
      receive notification of leap second scheduling. Without prior knowledge
      of leap second schedule, NTP servers and clients may become offset by
      exactly one second with respect to their UTC reference. This potential
      discrepancy begins when a leap second occurs and ends when all
      participants receive a time update from a server or peer. Depending on
      the system implementation, the offset can last anywhere from a few
      seconds to a few days. A long-lived discrepancy can be particularly
      disruptive to RTP operation.</t>

      <t>Because of the ambiguity leap seconds can introduce and the
      inconsistent manner in which different systems accommodate leap seconds,
      generating or using NTP timestamps during the entire last second of a
      day on which a leap second has been scheduled SHOULD be avoided. Note
      that the period to be avoided has a real-time duration of two
      seconds.</t>

      <section anchor="reports"
               title="RTP Sender Reports and Receiver Reports">
        <t>RTP Senders working to a leap-second-bearing reference SHOULD NOT
        generate sender reports containing an originating NTP timestamp in the
        vicinity of a leap second. Receivers SHOULD ignore timestamps in any
        such reports inadvertently generated.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="playout" title="RTP Packet Playout">
        <t>Receivers working to a leap-second-bearing reference SHOULD take
        leap seconds in their reference into account in determining playout
        time from RTP timestamps for data in RTP packets.</t>
