Abstract

   In this draft, a backup path setup mechanism is proposed for the
   P2P-RPL protocol in Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). This
   mechanism allows sensor nodes to send packets over the backup path
   without rediscovering the p2p path in case of path failure, thus
   improving the reliability of p2p transmission.

1. Introduction

   Reliable routing is the general name for those mechanisms in which
   data is transmitted from a node to another node with a highly
   successful delivering ratio. Normally, reliable routing establishes
   a reliable path from the source to the destination. Then, the data
   packet is forwarded to the destination based on those paths.
   However, links in WSNs maybe frequently broken due to scheduling or
   sensor node failure. Therefore, data may not reach the destination.
   Then, the source needs to reestablish the path to the destination to
   send these packets. This increases costs and delays the transmission
   process. However, nodes in WSNs have resource constraints in terms
   of energy and memory. Thus, energy efficiency, reliability, and
   delay are crucial problems.

   Currently, the P2P-RPL routing protocol [1] in the ROLL working
   group provides a standard protocol for communication between two

   nodes in Low power and Lossy Networks. This protocol relies on the
   RPL routing protocol [RFC6550]. First, the source acts as a sink and
   builds its own directed acyclic graph (DAG) to discover the
   destination. Then, the destination sends a unicast message back to
   the source node to confirm the path from the source to the
   destination. The current P2P-RPL routing protocol focuses on
   building only one point-to-point path. However, in an LLN
   environment, this path can be frequently broken at any time during
   the transmission phase. In this case, the overhead to rebuild the
   path from the beginning is very high.

   This document describes an extension to the P2P-RPL routing protocol
   on recovery after path failure. Nodes utilize the interactive path
   as alternative to quickly recover from failure to send packets to
   the destination instead of recreating the path. In particular, the
   purpose of the P2P-RPL-BACKUP is to immediately repair the path
   locally at the failed point to minimize cost and latency. The
   interactive path was created for this purpose without high extra
   overhead, which is composed of links including primary links and
   backup links for an optimal recovery path. In addition, this
   mechanism helps improve the performance of p2P-RPL routing in case
   of failure. Primary links and interactive links are defined in the
   terminology section.

2. Targeted Use Cases

   This document aims at point-to-point communication in LLN scenarios
   where reliability and delay constraints are not satisfied by P2P
   routes, especially in high broken link scenarios, including in
   industrial zone, home automation, and building automation.

   One typical example is due to the changes in the climate, a sensor
   to inform the cluster head of sensors in an area to change its
   parameters related to living conditions. In these applications,
   reliable transmission and delay are important. The message should be
   sent as quickly as possible. Then, retransmission of messages should
   be minimized.

3. Terminology

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

   Besides the terminology from [1], this draft also uses the following
   terms:

   Source: The node that initiates route discovery.

   Destination: The node at the end point of the discovery process.

   Intermediate: The nodes between the Source and the Destination.

   Primary path: The path is established between the source and the
   destination based on P2P-RPL routing protocol.

   Primary node: The nodes on the Primary path.

   Primary link: The links on the Primary path.

   Backup node: The nodes selected for backup forwarding in case of
   failure on the Primary path.

   Backup link: The links created between a primary node and a backup
   node or between two backup nodes.

   Backup path: The path created by backup nodes.

   Interactive path: The path created between the primary link and
   backup link for an optimal recovery path from the failure.

   Forward direction: The direction from a primary node to a backup
   node.

   Backward direction: The direction from a backup node to a primary
   node.

   Hop-by-hop route: The route by which each node uses the routing
   table to determine the next-hop.

4. P2P backup path setup with Local RPLInstanceID in LLNs

   This section briefly describes the P2P-RPL-BACKUP process.

   Our proposal is an extension of the P2P-RPL routing algorithm [1].
   As with the P2P-RPL routing protocol, the Source starts building its
   own new DAG by using IPv6 link-local multicast DIO messages to
   discover the destination. However, unlike P2P-RPL routing, which
   only focuses on creating one path, the P2P-RPL-BACKUP tries to build
   a recovery path in addition to the Primary path. The recovery path
   is used in case of failure in the Primary path. The backup path can
   be used as a recovery path to avoid rediscovering processes that may
   result in high overhead and latency.

Internet-Draft  Backup Path for Point-to-Point Routes        June 2013


   However, the failure may occur at any node or link on the Primary
   path. Therefore, retransmission on the backup path is not an optimal
   solution. P2P-RPL-BACKUP aims at repairing the path locally at the
   failed point immediately to minimize cost and latency. The
   interactive path is created for this purpose without high extra
   overhead and is composed of links, such as the primary link and
   backup link, for an optimal recovery path.

   The interactive path has special characteristics. The Primary path
   is responsible for transmitting packets from the Source to the
   Destination. The other paths are used as backup paths in the event a
   link is lost in the primary path. In this context, each node in the
   primary path has only one backup node in the secondary path. In
   addition, a node in the secondary path has connections with two
   nodes in the primary path. Once a packet arrives at a node, it has
   two options: It can be forwarded along the primary path or along the
   secondary path. Naturally, by utilizing the backup link at each
   node, the probability of a packet's successful transmission to the
   Destination is increased. Moreover, this algorithm helps reduce data
   packet transmission when the primary path is disrupted. Furthermore,
   the number of nodes in the secondary path are estimated and limited
   by the number of nodes in the primary path because each node in the
   primary path has a backup node.

   The Interactive-path-establishing process relies on the above
   characteristics. After the destination discovery phase, each node
   has its own position in the DAG of the Source by setting up its own
   rank [RFC6206]. Next, the Destination sends a discovery reply
   message back to its parent in the DAG of the Source to establish the
   Primary node. Then, this process is repeated until the Primary path
   is completely setup. The process of setting up the Interactive path
   occurs simultaneously. This is also based on the Discovery Reply
   message, which contains the Backup Path Establishing option and is
   defined in the next section, and includes two processes-establishing
   the connection between the Primary node and the Backup nodes and
   establishing the connection between the backup nodes. For the first
   process, the Destination sends its neighbors a Discovery Reply
   message that contains the above options and the rank of the
   Destination. If the rank of a neighbor is smaller than the rank
   contained in the option, the neighbor continues forwarding the reply
   message to its neighbor. Otherwise, this message is discarded. After
   the second-packet-broadcasting process occurs in the Destination's
   neighbor, if a node in the Primary path receives this message, based
   on the rank contained in each message, the node will choose the node
   with a greater than its rank, making it the smallest rank among the
   satisfying ranks. If multiple nodes satisfy the above condition, one
   of them is randomly chosen. For the second process, a DIO message

   that contains the Backup Path Confirming option (which is defined in
   the next section) is sent back to the chosen backup node. Then, this
   process is repeats to choose the next backup node. The entire
   process stops when it reaches the Source.

   In the above process, the Source has to clarify the following
   information:

   o The IPv6 address of the Destination: This address could be a
      unicast or multicast address.

   o The forwarding mechanism: hop-by-hop.

   In addition, one of the most important factors is the distance
   between the Source and the Destination, which determines whether the
   Destination should establish a path to the Source. If this distance
   is too great, energy is wasted forming a path from the Source to the
   Sink and from the Sink to the Destination.

   After setting up the paths, except the interactive links, other
   links are unnecessary, and nodes do not keep those connections. Then,
   the DAG is released.

   Finally, the data packets are forwarded along the Interactive path
   and adhere to the following rule: The Source sends data along the
   Primary path. If there is a broken link in this path, the
   intermediate node will redirect the data to the node in the
   Interactive path. At this node, the data are forwarded to the next
   hop in the Primary path if the link is available. Otherwise, the
   data are forwarded to the next-hop in the Interactive path.

5. P2P backup path setup with Global RPLInstanceID in LLNs

   This part provides a method of guaranteeing the path for
   transmitting data packets over multiple domains. This path includes
   three sub-paths. The first one is from the Source to the Sink which
   has the same RPLInstanceID with the Source. The second is between
   the above Sink and the Sink which has the same RPLInstanceID with
   the Destination. And the third is from the latter Sink to the
   Destination. Specifically, there are two sub-paths, the first and
   the third, are protected with high reliability. The second must
   establish the tunnel between them. However, it is out of the scope
   of this draft.

   The process of establishing above path is similar to the process
   which is presented in the section 4. However, the RPLInstanceID of
   the Destination and the Source MUST be supplemented.

   Therefore, in order to meet the above functional requirements, some
   parameters should be added in the header of the packet.

    o Flag G: Must be set to one if RPLInstaceID of the Destination and
      the Source are different

    o Additional header length

    o RPLInstanceID Source: the RPLInstanceID of the Source

    o RPLInstanceID Destination: the RPLInstanceID of the Destination
