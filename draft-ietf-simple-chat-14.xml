      <t>The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) defines a
        mechanism for sending instant messages within a peer-to-peer
        session, negotiated using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
        and the Session Description Protocol (SDP). This document
        defines the necessary tools for establishing multi-party
        chat sessions, or chat rooms, using MSRP.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

      <t>
        The <xref target="RFC4975">Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
        </xref> defines a mechanism for sending a series of instant 
        messages within a session. The <xref target="RFC3261">
          Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)</xref> in
        combination with the <xref target="RFC4566">Session Description
          Protocol (SDP)</xref> allows for two peers to establish and manage
        such sessions.
      </t>

      <t>
        In another application of SIP, a user agent can join in a
        multi-party conversation called a conference that is hosted 
        by a specialized user agent called a focus 
        <xref target="RFC4353" />. Such a
        conference can naturally involve MSRP sessions. 
        It is the responsibility of an
        entity handling the media to relay instant messages received from
        one participant to the rest of the participants in the
        conference.  
      </t>

      <t>
        Several such systems already exist in the
        Internet. Participants in a chat room can be identified with a
        pseudonym or nickname, and decide whether their real identifier is
        disclosed to other participants. Participants can also use a rich
        set of features such as the ability to send private instant
        messages to other participants. 
      </t>


      <t>
	Similar conferences supporting chat rooms are already
	available today.  For example, <xref target="RFC2810">Internet
	Relay Chat (IRC)</xref>, <xref target="RFC6120">Extensible
	Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core</xref> based chat
	rooms, and many other proprietary systems provide chat room
	functionality. Specifying equivalent functionality for
	MSRP-based systems provides competitive features and enables
	interworking between the systems.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document defines requirements, conventions, and
        extensions for providing private messages and nickname
        management in centralized chat rooms with MSRP. Participants
        in a chat room can be identified by a pseudonym, and decide if
        their real identifier is disclosed to other participants. This
        memo uses the <xref target="RFC4353"> SIP Conferencing
        Framework</xref> as a design basis. It also aims to be
        compatible with the <xref target="RFC5239">A Framework for
        Centralized Conferencing</xref>.  Should requirements arise,
        future mechanisms for providing similar functionality in
        generic conferences might be developed, for example, where the
        media is not only restricted to MSRP. The mechanisms described
        in this document provide a future compatible short-term
        solution for MSRP centralized chat rooms. </t>

      <t>This memo deals with tightly coupled SIP
        conferences defined in <xref target="RFC4353"> 
        SIP Conferencing Framework </xref> and adopts the terminology
	from that document. In addition to that terminology, 
        we introduce some new terms:

            an instance of a tightly coupled conference, in which the media
            exchanged between the participants consist of MSRP

          <t hangText="Chat Room URI: "> a URI that identifies a particular

            mixer with the exception that the MSRP switch does not actually
            "mix" together different input media streams; it merely relays the

    <section anchor="motivation" title="Motivations and Requirements">
      
      <t>
        Although conference frameworks describing many types of
        conferencing applications already exist, such as the <xref
        target="RFC5239">Framework for Centralized Conferencing</xref>
        and the <xref target="RFC4353">SIP Conferencing
        Framework</xref>, the exact details of session-based instant
        messaging conferences (chat rooms) are not well-defined at the
        moment.
      </t>

      <t>
        To allow interoperable chat implementations, for both
        conference-aware, and conference-unaware user agents, certain
        conventions for MSRP chat rooms need to be defined. It also seems
        beneficial to provide a set of features that enhance the baseline
        multi-party MSRP in order to be able to create systems that have
        functionality on par with existing chat systems, as well as enable 
        building interworking gateways to these existing chat systems.
      </t>

      <t>We define the following requirements:</t>
      
      <t>
        <list style='format REQ-%d:'>
          
          <t>
            A basic requirement is the existence of a chat room, where
            participants can join and leave the chat room and get
            instant messages exchanged to the rest of the
            participants.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            A recipient of an instant message in a chat room must be
            able to determine the identifier of the sender of the
            message. Note that the actual identifier depends on the
            one which was used by the sender when he or she joined the
            chat room.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            A recipient of an instant message in a chat room must be
            able to determine the identifier of the recipient of
            received messages. For instance, the recipient of the
            message might be the entire chat room or a single
            participant (i.e., a private message). Note that the
            actual identifier may depend on the one which was used by
            the recipient when he or she joined the chat room.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            It must be possible to send a message to a single
            participant within the chat room (i.e., a private instant message).
          </t>
          
          <t>
            A chat room participant may have a nickname or pseudonym
            associated with their real identifier.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            It must be possible for a participant to change their nickname
            during the progress of the chat room session.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            It must be possible that a participant is only known by an
            anonymous identifier and not their real identifier to the rest
            of the chat room.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            It must be possible for chat room participants to 
            learn the chat room capabilities described in this document.
          </t>

    <section anchor="overview" title="Overview of Operation">
      
      <t>
        In order to enter a chat room, one must first be
        created. Users wishing to host a chat room themselves can of
        course do just that; their User Agent (UA) simply morphs from an
        ordinary UA into a special purpose one called a Focus UA. 
        Another, commonly used setup is one where a dedicated
        node in the network functions as a Focus UA.
      </t>

      <t>
        Each chat room has an identifier of its own: a SIP URI that
        participants use to join the chat room, e.g. by sending an
        INVITE request to it. The conference focus processes the invitations,
        and as such, maintains SIP dialogs with each participant. In a
        multi-party chat, or chat room, MSRP is one of the
        established media streams. Each chat room participant
        establishes an MSRP session with the MSRP switch, which is a
        special purpose MSRP application. The MSRP sessions can be relayed 
        by one or more MSRP relays, which are specified in <xref
	target="RFC4976">RFC 4976</xref>.  
        This is illustrated in <xref target="scenario" />

        The MSRP switch is similar to a
        conference mixer in that it handles media sessions with each
        of the participants and bridges these streams together. However,
        unlike a conference mixer, the MSRP switch merely forwards
        messages between participants but doesn't actually mix the
        streams in any way. The system is illustrated in

      <t>
        Typically chat room participants also subscribe to a
        conference event package to gather information about the
        conference roster in the form of conference state
        notifications.  For example, participants can learn about
        other participants' identifiers, including their nicknames.
      </t>

      <t>
        All messages in the chat room use the 
        <xref target="RFC3862">'Message/CPIM' wrapper content type</xref>, 
        so that it is possible to distinguish between private and regular
        messages. When a participant wants to send an instant message to
        the chat room, it constructs an MSRP SEND request and submits
        it to the MSRP switch including a regular payload (e.g. a
        Message/CPIM message that contains a text, HTML, an image,
        etc.). The Message/CPIM To header is set to the chat room
        URI. The switch then fans out the SEND request to all of the
        other participants using their existing MSRP sessions. 
      </t>

      <t>
        A participant can also send a private instant message
        addressed to a participant whose identifier has been learned,
        e.g. via a conference event package.  In this case the sender
        creates an MSRP SEND request with a Message/CPIM wrapper whose
        To header contains not the chat room URI but the recipient's
        URI. The MSRP switch then forwards the SEND request to that
        recipient. This specification supports the sending of private
        messages to one and only one recipient. However, if the
        recipient is logged from different endpoints, the MSRP switch
        will distribute the private message to each endpoint the
        recipient is logged.
      </t>

      <t>
        We extend the current MSRP negotiation that takes place in
        <xref target="RFC4566">SDP </xref> to allow participants to
        learn whether the chat room supports and is willing to accept
        (e.g. due to local policy restrictions) certain MSRP functions
        defined in this memo, such as nicknames or private
        messaging.
      </t>

      <t>
        Naturally, when a participant wishes to leave a chat room,
        it sends a SIP BYE request to the Focus UA and
        terminates the SIP dialog with the focus and MSRP sessions with
        the MSRP switch.

	This document assumes that each chat room is allocated its own
	SIP URI. A user joining a chat room sends an INVITE request to
	that SIP URI, and as a result, a new MSRP session is established
	between the user and the MSRP switch. It is assumed that an
	MSRP session is mapped to a chat room. If a user wants to join
	a second chat room, he creates a different INVITE request,
	through a different SIP dialog, which leads to the creation of
	a second MSRP session between the user and the MSRP
	switch. Notice that these two MSRP sessions can still be
	multiplexed over the same TCP connection as per regular MSRP
	procedures. However,  each chat room is associated to a
	unique MSRP session and a unique SIP dialog.

          Since we consider a chat room a particular type of
          conference having MSRP media, the methods defined by the
          <xref target="RFC4353" >SIP Conference Framework </xref> for
          creating conferences are directly applicable to a chat room.
        </t>

        <t>
          Once a chat room is created, it is identified by a SIP URI,
          like any other conference.

      <section title="Joining a Chat Room" anchor="joining">

        <t>
          Participants usually join the chat room by sending an
          INVITE request to the chat room URI. As long as the
          chat room policy allows, the INVITE request is accepted by
          the focus and the user is brought into the actual chat room.
        </t>

        <t> 
	  The MSRP switch needs to be aware of the URIs of the
	  participant (SIP, Tel, or IM URIs) in order to validate
	  messages sent from this participant prior to their
	  forwarding. This information is known to the focus of the
	  conference. Therefore an interface between the focus and the
	  MSRP switch is assumed. However, the interface between the
	  focus and the MSRP switch is outside the scope of this
	  document.

          is a focus, and can not apply the additional mechanisms
          defined in this document.  Participants are also aware that
          the mixer is an MSRP switch due to the presence of a
          'message' media type and either TCP/MSRP or TCP/TLS/MSRP as
          the protocol field in the media line of <xref

          the From and To headers in the 'Message/CPIM' wrapper, and can 
          be learned by the other participants of the

          Deleting a chat room is an action that heavily depends on the

        <t>
          This section describes the conventions used to send and receive
          instant messages that are addressed to all the participants in the
          chat room. These are sent over a regular MSRP SEND request that
          contains a <xref target="RFC3862">Message/CPIM wrapper </xref>
          that in turn contains the desired payload (e.g. text, image,
          video-clip, etc.).
        </t>

        <t>
          When a chat room participant wishes to send an instant
          message to all the other participants in the chat room,
          it constructs an MSRP SEND request according to the
          procedures specified in <xref target="RFC4975">RFC
          4975</xref>. The sender MAY choose the desired MSRP report
          model (e.g., populate the Success-Report and Failure-Report
          MSRP header fields).
	</t>
	<t>
	  The SEND request MUST contain a top-level wrapper of type
	  'Message/CPIM' according to <xref target="RFC3862">RFC
	  3862</xref>. The actual instant message payload MUST be
	  included as payload of the 'Message/CPIM' wrapper and MAY be
	  of any type negotiated in the SDP 'accept-types' attribute
	  according to the MSRP rules.
        </t>

        <t>
	  On sending a regular message the sender MUST populate the To
	  header of the Message/CPIM wrapper with the URI of the chat
	  room. The sender SHOULD populate the From header of the
	  Message/CPIM wrapper with a proper identifier by which the
	  user is recognized in the chat room. Identifiers that can be
	  used (among others) are:
	</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
	    <t>A <xref target="RFC3261">SIP URI</xref> representing the
	      participant's address-of-record</t>
	    <t>A <xref target="RFC3966">tel URI</xref> representing the
	      participant's telephone number</t>
	    <t>An <xref target="RFC3860">IM URI</xref> representing the
	      participant's instant messaging address</t>
	    <t>An Anonymous URI representing the participant's
	    anonymous address</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          An MSRP switch that receives a SEND request from a
          participant SHOULD first verify that the From header field
          of the Message/CPIM wrapper is correctly populated with a
          valid URI of a participant. This imposes a requirement for
          the focus of the conference to inform the MSRP switch of the
          URIs by which the participant is known, in order for the
          MSRP switch to validate messages. <xref target="reports"/>
          provides further information with the actions to be taken in
          case this validation fails.
        </t>

        <t>
          Then the MSRP switch should inspect the To header field of
          the Message/CPIM wrapper.  If the MSRP switch receives a
          message containing several To header fields in the
          Message/CPIM wrapper the MSRP switch MUST reject the MSRP
          SEND request with a 403 response, as per procedures in <xref
          target="RFC4975">RFC 4975</xref>. Then, if the To header
          field of the Message/CPIM wrapper contains the chat room URI
          and there are no other To header fields, the MSRP switch can
          generate a copy of the SEND request to each of the
          participants in the chat room except the sender. The MSRP
          switch MUST NOT modify the content received in the SEND
          request. However, the MSRP switch MAY re-chunk any of the
          outbound MSRP SEND requests.
	</t>


	<t>
	  Note that the MSRP switch does not need to wait for the
	  reception of the complete MSRP chunk or MSRP message before
	  it starts the distribution to the rest of the
	  participants. Instead, once the MSRP switch has received the
	  headers of the Message/CPIM wrapper it SHOULD start the
	  distribution process. 
	</t>
	<t>
	  When forwarding chunked messages as soon as they are
	  received, the Message/CPIM wrapper is only present at the
	  beginning of the message, typically within the first
	  chunk. Subsequent chunks will contain the rest of the
	  message, but not the Message/CPIM headers. Therefore, an
	  MSRP switch that receives a subsequent message may face
	  challenges in determining the correct list of recipients of
	  the message. An MSRP switch that uses this fast forwarding
	  procedure MUST temporarily store the Message-Id of the MSRP
	  message to correlate the different chunks, as well as it
	  MUST temporarily store the list of recipients to which the
	  initial chunks were delivered. The MSRP switch SHOULD
	  forward subsequent chunks only to those recipients who were
	  sent the initial chunks, except if the MSRP switch has
	  knowledge that one of the recipients of the initial chunks
	  has dropped from the chat room. This behavior also avoids
	  new participants who joined the chat room when the first
	  chunk has been distributed to receive subsequent chunks that
	  would otherwise need to be discarded.
        </t>

        <t>
          An MSRP endpoint that receives a SEND request from the MSRP
          switch containing a Message/CPIM wrapper SHOULD first
          inspect the To header field of the Message/CPIM wrapper. If
          the To header field is set to the chat room URI, it should
          render it as a regular message that has been distributed to
          all the participants in the chat room. Then the MSRP
          endpoint SHOULD inspect the From header field of the
          Message/CPIM wrapper to identify the sender. The From header
          field will include a URI that identifies the sender. The
          endpoint might have also received further identifier
          information through a subscription to a conference event
          package.
        </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Private Messages" anchor="private-messages">

        <t>
          This section describes the conventions used to send and
          receive private instant messages, i.e., instant messages
          that are addressed to one participant of the chat room
          rather to all of them. A chat room can signal support for
          private messages using the 'chatroom' attribute in SDP (see
          <xref target="chatroom-attribute"/> for details).
        </t>

        <t>
          When a chat room participant wishes to send a private
          instant message to a participant in the chat room, it
          follows the same procedures for creating a SEND request as
          for <xref target="regular"> regular messages </xref>.  The
          only difference is that the MSRP endpoint MUST populate a
          single To header of the Message/CPIM wrapper with the
          identifier of the intended recipient.  The identifier can be
          SIP, TEL, and IM URIs typically learned from the information
          received in notifications of a conference event package.
	</t>

        <t>
          As for regular messages, an MSRP switch that receives a SEND
          request from a participant SHOULD first verify that the From
          header field of the Message/CPIM wrapper is correctly
          populated with a valid URI (i.e., the URI is a participant
          of this chat room). <xref target="reports"/> provides further
	  information with the actions to be taken in case this
	  validation fails.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Then the MSRP switch MUST inspect the To header field of the
	  Message/CPIM wrapper. If the MSRP switch receives a message
	  containing several To header fields in the Message/CPIM
	  wrapper the MSRP switch MUST reject the MSRP SEND request
	  with a 403 response, as per procedures in <xref
	  target="RFC4975">RFC 4975</xref>. Then the MSRP switch MUST
	  verify that the To header of the Message/CPIM wrapper
	  matches the URI of a participant of the chat room. If this
	  To header field does not contain the URI of a participant of
	  the chat room or if the To header field cannot be resolved
	  (e.g., caused by a mistyped URI), the MSRP switch MUST
	  reject the request with a 404 response. This new 404 status
	  code indicates a failure to resolve the recipient URI in the
	  To header field of the Message/CPIM wrapper.
	</t>

        <t>
	  <list style="empty">
	    <t>
	    Notice the importance of the From and To headers in the
	    Message/CPIM wrapper. If an intermediary modifies these
	    values, the MSRP switch might not be able to identify the
	    source or intended destination of the message, resulting
	    in a rejection of the message.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>


	<t>
	  Finally, the MSRP switch MUST verify that the recipient
	  supports private messages. If the recipient does not support
	  private messages, the MSRP switch MUST reject the request
	  with a 428 response.  This new response 428 indicates that
	  the recipient does not support private messages.  Any
	  potential REPORT request that the MSRP switch sends to the
	  sender MUST include a Message/CPIM wrapper containing the
	  original From header field included in the SEND request and
	  the To header field of the original Message/CPIM wrapper.
	  The MSRP switch MUST NOT forward private messages to a
	  recipient that does not support private messaging.
	</t>
	<t>
	  If successful, the MSRP switch should search its mapping
	  table to find the MSRP sessions established towards the
	  recipient.  If a match is found the MSRP switch MUST create
	  a SEND request and MUST copy the contents of the sender's
	  message to it. 
        </t>
        
        <t>
          An MSRP endpoint that receives a SEND request from the MSRP
          switch does the same validations as for <xref
          target="regular"> regular messages </xref>.  If the To
          header field is different from the chat room URI, the MSRP
          endpoints knows that this is a private message.  The
          endpoint should render who it is from based on the value of
          the From header of the Message/CPIM wrapper. The endpoint
          can also use the sender’s nickname, possibly learned via a
          conference event package, to render such nickname rather
          than the sender’s actual URI.

        <!--- Multiple calls using same participant URI  -->
        <t>
          It is possible that a participant, identified by a SIP
          Address of Record or other valid URI, joins a chat room from
          two or more different SIP UAs. It is RECOMMENDED that the
          MSRP switch can map a URI to two or more MSRP sessions.  If
          the policy of the server allows for this, the MSRP switch
          MUST copy all messages intended to the recipient through
          each MSRP session mapped to the recipient's URI.

	</t>
	<t>
	  MSRP switches MUST follow the success report and failure
	  report handling described in section 7 of <xref
	  target="RFC4975">RFC 4975</xref>, complemented with the
	  procedures described in this section. The MSRP switch MUST
	  act as an MSRP endpoint receiver of the request according to
	  section 5.3 of <xref target="RFC4975">RFC 4975</xref>.
        </t>

       <t>
	  If the MSRP switch receives an MSRP SEND request that does
	  not contain a Message/CPIM wrapper, the MSRP switch MUST
	  reject the request with a 415 response (specified in <xref
	  target="RFC4975">RFC 4975</xref>).
       </t>

       <t>
	  If the MSRP switch receives an MSRP SEND request where the
	  URI included in the From header field of the Message/CPIM
	  wrapper is not valid, (e.g, because it does not "belong" to
	  the sender of the message or is not a valid participant of
	  the chat room), the MSRP switch MUST reject the request with
	  a 403 response. In non-error cases, the MSRP switch MUST
	  construct responses according to section 7.2 of <xref
	  target="RFC4975">RFC 4975</xref>.
       </t>


        <t>
	  When the MSRP switch forwards a SEND request,  it MAY use any
	  report model in the copies intended for the recipients.
	  The receiver reports from the recipients MUST NOT be
          forwarded to the originator of the original SEND request.
          This could lead to having the sender receiving multiple

      <section anchor="congestion" title="Congestion Avoidance">

	<t>
	  Congestion can occur when multiple heterogeneous interfaces
	  are used by a diversity of users who are participating in a
	  chat room. Some of these users might have fast path capable
	  of high throughputs while other users might be slow paths
	  with constrained throughputs. It is therefore possible that
	  a subset of the participants of the chat room are able to
	  send and receive messages at a high rate or with large
	  contents (e.g., pictures), whereas others are not able to
	  keep the pace.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Additionally, since MSRP uses a connection-oriented
	  transport protocol such as TCP, it is expected that
	  the TCP congestion avoidance mechanisms will also be
	  activated should congestion occur.
	</t>
	<t>
	  While this document does not mandate a particular
	  MSRP-specific mechanism to avoid congestion in any of the
	  paths, something that is deemed outside the scope of this
	  document, this document provides some recommendations for
	  implementors to consider.
	</t>
	<t>
	  It is RECOMMENDED that MSRP switches implement one or more
	  MSRP-specific strategies to detect and avoid
	  congestion. Possible strategies (but definitely not a
	  comprehensive list) include:
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>If the MSRP switch is writing data to a send buffer and
	    detects that the send buffer associated to that TCP
	    connection is getting full (e.g., close to 80% of its
	    capacity), the MSRP switch marks the associated MSRP
	    sessions making use of that TCP connection as "congested".
	    </t>

	    <t>Prior to sending a new MSRP message to a user, the MSRP
	    switch verifies the congested flag associated to that MSRP
	    session. If the MSRP session is marked as congested, the
	    MSRP switch can apply a congestion avoidance mechanism,
	    such as:
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      <list style="symbols">
		<t>
		  The MSRP switch can discard regular MSRP messages sent to
		  that user while the TCP send buffer is
		  congested. In order to inform the user of the
		  congestion, the MSRP switch can send a regular
		  MSRP message indicating the user that some messages
		  are discarded due to network congestion.
		</t>
		<t>
		  The MSRP can implement a temporary policy to
		  disallow the distribution of messages larger than a

    <section anchor="nicknames" title="Nicknames">

      <t>
        A common characteristic of existing chat room services is
        that participants have the ability to present themselves with
        a nickname to the rest of the participants of the
        chat room. It is used for easy reference of participants 
        in the chat room, and can also provide anonymous participants 
        with a meaningful descriptive name.
      </t>

      <t>
        A nickname is a useful construct in many use cases, of which
        MSRP chat is but one example. It is associated with a URI of
        which the participant is known to the focus. Therefore, if a
        user joins the chat room under the same URI from multiple
        devices, he or she may request the same nickname across all
        these devices. 
      </t>
      <t>
        A nickname is a user selectable appearance of which the
        participant wants to be known to the other participants. It is
        not a 'display-name', but it is used somewhat like a display
        name.  A main difference is that a nickname is unique inside a

        in the chat.  Nicknames may be long lived, or may be

        utilization.

      <t> 
        This memo specifies the nickname as a string.  The nickname
        string MUST be unambiguous within the scope of the chat room
        (conference instance).  This scope is similar to having a
        nickname unique inside a chat room from <xref
        target="RFC6120">Extensible Messaging and Presence
        Protocol</xref>. The chat room may have policies associated
        with nicknames.  It may not accept nickname strings at all, or
        a it may provide a wider unambiguous scope like a domain or
        server, similar to <xref target="RFC2810">Internet Relay Chat
        (IRC)</xref>.

        <t> 
          This memo provides a mechanism to reserve a nickname for a
          participant for as long as the participant is logged into
          the chat room.  The mechanism is based on a NICKNAME MSRP
          method (see below) and a new "Use-Nickname" header. Note
          that other mechanisms may exist (for example, a web page
          reservation system), although they are outside the scope of
          this document.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          A chat room participant who has established an MSRP session
          with the MSRP switch, where the MSRP switch has indicated
          the support and availability of nicknames with the
          'nicknames' token in the 'chatroom' SDP attribute, MAY send
          a NICKNAME request to the MSRP switch. The NICKNAME request
          MUST include a new Use&nbhy;Nickname header that contains
          the nickname string that the participant wants to
          reserve. MSRP NICKNAME requests MUST NOT include
	  Success-Report or Failure-Report header fields. 
	</t>

        <t>
          An MSRP switch that receives a NICKNAME request containing
          a Use&nbhy;Nickname header field SHOULD
          first verify whether the policy of the chat room allows the
          nickname functionality. If not allowed, the MSRP switch
          MUST reject the request with a 403 response, as per <xref
          target="RFC4975">RFC 4975</xref>.
        </t>

        <t>
          If the policy of the chat room allows the usage of
          nicknames, the MSRP switch SHOULD validate that the SIP AOR
          identifying the user is entitled to reserve the
          nickname. This may include, e.g., allowing that the
          participant's URI may use the same nickname when the
          participant has joined the chat room from different devices
          under the same URI. The participant's authenticated
          identifier can be derived after a successful <xref
          target="RFC3261">SIP Digest Authentication </xref>, be
          included in a trusted <xref target="RFC3325">SIP
          P-Asserted-Identity header field </xref>, be included in a
          valid <xref target="RFC4474">SIP Identity header field
          </xref>, or be derived from any other present or future SIP
          authentication mechanism.  Once the MSRP switch has
          validated that the participant is entitled to reserve the
          requested nickname, the MSRP switch verifies if the
          suggested nickname can be accepted (see below).
        </t>

        <t>
          The reservation of a nickname can fail in several cases. If
          the NICKNAME request contains a malformed value in the
          Use&nbhy;Nickname header field, the MSRP switch MUST answer
          the NICKNAME request with a 424 response code. This can be
          the case when the value of the Use&nbhy;Nickname header
          field does not conform to the syntax.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The reservation of a nickname can also fail if the value of
	  the Use&nbhy;Nickname header field of the NICKNAME request
	  is a reserved word (not to be used as a nickname by any
	  user) or that particular value is already in use by another
	  user. In this case the MSRP switch MUST answer the NICKNAME
	  request wihta 425 response code.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In both error conditions (receiving a 424 or 425 respose
	  code), the nickname usage is considered failed; the nickname
	  is not allocated to this user. The user can select a
	  different nickname and retry another NICKNAME request.
	  nickname is not allocated to this user".
        </t>
	
	<t>
	  If the MSRP switch is able to accept the suggested nickname
	  to be used by this user, the MSRP switch MUST answer the
	  NICKNAME request with a 200 response as per regular MSRP
	  procedures.
	</t>
        <t>
          As indicated earlier, this specification defines a new MSRP
          header field: "Use-Nickname". The Use&nbhy;Nickname header
          field carries a nickname string. This specification defines the usage
          of the Use&nbhy;Nickname header field in NICKNAME
          requests. If need arises, usages of the Use&nbhy;Nickname header
          field in other MSRP methods should be specified separately.
        </t>

        <t>
          The syntax of the NICKNAME method and the "Use-Nickname"
          header field is built upon the 
          <xref target="RFC4975">MSRP formal syntax </xref>

	<t>
	  Once the MSRP switch has reserved a nickname and has bound
	  it to a URI (e.g., a SIP Address-of-Record), the MSRP server
	  MAY allow the usage of the same nickname by the same user
	  (identified by the same URI, such as a SIP AoR) over a
	  second MSRP session. This might be the case if the user
	  joins the same chat room from a different SIP User Agent. In
	  this case, the user MAY request the same or a different
	  nickname than that used in conjunction with the first MSRP
	  session; the MSRP server MAY accept the usage of the same
	  nickname by the same user. The MSRP switch MUST NOT
	  automatically assign the same nickname to more than one MSRP
	  session established from the same URI, because this can
	  create confusion to the user as whether the same nickname is
	  bound to the second MSRP session.

      <section title="Modifying a Nickname"
               anchor="mod-nicknames">

        <t>
          Typically a participant will reserve a nickname as soon as the participant
          joins the chat room. But it is also
          possible for a participant to modify his/her own nickname and
          replace it with a new one at any time during the duration of the
          MSRP session. Modification of the nickname is not different from
          the initial reservation and usage of a nickname, thus the
          NICKNAME method is used as described in 
          <xref target="using-nicknames" />.</t>
        
        <t>
          If a NICKNAME request that attempts to modify the current
          nickname of the user for some reason fails, the current nickname
          stays in effect. A new nickname comes into effect and the old
          one is released only after a NICKNAME request is accepted with a
          200 response.

        <t>
          If the participant no longer wants to be known by a nickname
          in the chat room, the participant can follow the method 
          described in <xref target="mod-nicknames" />.  
          The nickname element of the Use&nbhy;Nickname header MUST be
          set to an empty quoted string.

    <section title="The SDP 'chatroom' attribute"
	     anchor="chatroom-attribute" >
      <t>
        There are a handful of use cases where a participant would
        like to learn the chat room capabilities supported by the MSRP
        switch and the chat room. For example, a participant would
        like to learn if the MSRP switch supports private messaging,
        otherwise, the participant may send what he believes is a
        private instant message addressed to a participant, but since
        the MSRP switch does not support the functions specified in
        this memo, the message gets eventually distributed to all the
        participants of the chat room.
      </t>

      <t>
        The reverse case also exists. A participant, say Alice, whose
        user agent does not support the extensions defined by this
        document joins the chat room. The MSRP switch learns that Alice's
        application does not support private messaging nor nicknames. If
        another participant, say Bob, sends a private message to Alice,
        the MSRP switch does not distribute it to Alice, because Alice is
        not able to differentiate it from a regular message sent to the
        whole roster. Furthermore, if Alice replied to this message, she
        would do it to the whole roster. Because of this, the MSRP switch
        also keeps track of users who do not support the extensions
        defined in this document.
      </t>

      <t>
        In another scenario, the policy of a chat room may indicate
        that certain functions are not allowed. For example, the policy
        may indicate that nicknames or private messages are not
        allowed. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
        In order to provide the user with a good chat room experience,
        we define a new 'chatroom' SDP attribute. The 'chatroom'
        attribute is a <xref target="RFC4566">media-level value
        attribute </xref> that MAY be included in conjunction with an
        MSRP media stream (i.e., when an m= line in SDP indicates
        "TCP/MSRP" or "TCP/TLS/MSRP").  The 'chatroom' attribute
        without further modifiers (e.g., chat-tokens) indicates that
        the endpoint supports the procedures described in this
        document for transferring MSRP messages to/from a chat
        room. The 'chatroom' attribute can be complemented with
        additional modifiers that further indicate the intersection of
        support and local policy allowance for a number of functions
        specified in this document. Specifically, we provide the means
        for indicating support to use nicknames and private messaging.
      </t>

      <t>
	The 'chatroom' attribute merely indicates the capabilities
	supported and allowed by the local policy. This attribute is
	not a negotiation subject to the <xref target="RFC3264">SDP
	offer/answer model</xref>, but instead a
	declaration. Therefore, a 'chatroom' attribute included in an
	SDP answer does not need to be a subset of the values included
	in the 'chatroom' attribute of its corresponding SDP
	offer. Consequently, an SDP answer MAY contain a 'chatroom'
	attribute even if its corresponding SDP offer did not include
	it.
      </t>

      <t>
	On doing subsequent <xref target="RFC3264">SDP
	offer/answer</xref> exchanges pertaining to the same session,
	the 'chatroom' attribute MAY be modified with respect an
	earlier SDP offer/answer exchange. The new value of this
	attribute indicate the current support and local policy,
	meaning that some restrictions can apply now or might have
	been removed. If the 'chatroom' attribute is not included in a
	subsequent SDP offer/answer, but is corresponding MSRP stream
	is still in place, it indicates that support for the
	procedures indicated in this document are disabled.
      </t>

      <t>
        The 'chatroom' SDP attribute has the following <xref

      <t>
        A conference focus that includes the 'nicknames' token in the
        session description is signaling that the MSRP switch supports and
        the chat room allows to use the procedures specified in 
        <xref target="nicknames"/>. A conference focus that includes the
        'private-messages' in the SDP description is signaling that the
        MSRP switch supports and the chat room allows to use the procedures
        specified in <xref target="private-messages" />. 
      </t>

      <t>
        Example of the 'chatroom' attribute for an MSRP media stream

          a=chatroom
      </artwork></figure>

      <t>
	The 'chatroom' attribute allows extensibility with the
	addition of new tokens. No IANA registry is provided at this
	time, since no extensions are expected at the time of this
	writing. Extensions to the 'chatroom' attribute can be defined
	in IETF documents or as private vendor extensions. 
      </t>
      <t>
        Extensions defined in IETF document MUST follow the
        'standard-token' ABNF previously defined. In this type of
        extensions, are must be taken in the selection of the token to
        avoid a clash with any of the tokens previously defined.
      </t>
      <t>
	Private extensions MUST follow the 'private-token' ABNF
	previously defined. The 'private-token' MUST include the DNS
	name of the vendor in reverse order in the token, in order to
	avoid clashes of tokens. The following is an example of a
	"chat.foo" extension by vendor "example.com"

      <t>This document proposes extensions to the <xref
      target="RFC4975">Message Session Relay Protocol
      </xref>. Therefore, the security considerations of that document
      apply to this document as well.
      </t>

      <t> If the participant's SIP user agent doesn't understand the
      <xref target="RFC3840"> "isfocus" feature tag </xref>, it will
      not know that it is connected to a conference instance. The
      participant might not be notified that the participant's MSRP
      client will try to send messages to the MSRP switch having
      potentially multiple recipients.  If the participant's MSRP
      client doesn't support the extensions of this specification, it
      is unlikely that it will try to send a message using <xref
      target="RFC3862">'Message/CPIM' wrapper content type</xref>, and
      the MSRP switch will reject the request with a <xref
      target="RFC4975">415 response</xref>.  Still if a participant's
      MSRP client does create a message with a valid <xref
      target="RFC3862">'Message/CPIM' wrapper content type</xref>
      having the To header set to the URI of the chat room and the
      From header set to the URI of which the participant is known to
      the chat room, the participant might be unaware that the
      message can be forwarded to multiple recipients. Equally if the
      To header is set to a valid URI of a recipient known to the
      chat room, the message can be forwarded as a private message
      without the participant knowing.
      </t>


      <t> 
	If a participant wants to avoid eavesdropping, the
	participant's MSRP client can send the messages over a <xref
	target="RFC5246">TLS </xref> transport connection, as allowed
	by MSRP.  It's up to the policy of the MSRP switch if the
	messages are forwarded to the other participant's in the chat
	room using <xref target="RFC5246">TLS </xref> transport.
      </t>

      <t> 
        Nicknames are used to show the appearance of the participants
        of the chat room.  A successful take over of a nickname from a
        participant might lead to private messages to be sent to the
        wrong destination.  The recipient's URI will be different from
        the URI associated to the original owner of the nickname, but
        the sender might not notice this.  To avoid takeovers the MSRP
        switch MUST make sure that a nickname is unique inside a chat
        room. Also the security consideration for any authenticated
        identity mechanisms used to validate the SIP AOR will apply to
        this document as well.  If a nickname can be reserved if it
        previously has been used by another participant in the chat
        room, is up to the policy of the chat room.
