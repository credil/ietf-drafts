Internet-Draft             HTTP Digest Update              June 22, 2013


1  Introduction

   This document specifies extensions to the HTTP Digest Access
   Authentication scheme by adding support for the SHA1 and SHA2 suite
   of hash algorithms [FIPS186-3].  RFC2617 specifies the MD5 algorithm
   as the default hash algorithm used in the digest access
   authentication scheme.  Since RFC2617 was first proposed, the MD5
   algorithm has been broken.  In 2008 the US-CERT issued a note that
   MD5 "should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for
   further use" [CERT-VU].


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].


2  Digest Access Authentication Scheme

   The Digest Access Authentication scheme is based on a simple
   challenge-response paradigm.  The Digest scheme challenges using a
   nonce value.  A valid response contains a checksum of the username,
   the password, the given nonce value and the requested URI. In this
   way the password is never sent in the clear.


2.1 Introduction


2.1.1 Representation of digest values

   An optional header allows the server to specify the algorithm used to
   create the checksum or digest.  By default and to maintain backwards
   compatibility, the MD5 algorithm is used. 

   The size of the digest depends on the algorithm used.  The bits in
   the digest are converted from the most significant to the least
   significant bit, four bits at a time to the ASCII representation as
   follows. Each four bits is represented by its familiar hexadecimal
   notation from the characters 0123456789abcdef, that is binary 0000 is
   represented by the character '0', 0001 by '1' and so on up to the
   representation of 1111 as 'f'. If the MD5 algorithm is used to
   calculate the digest, then the digest will be represented as 32
   hexadecimal characters, SHA1 by 40 hexadecimal characters, SHA2-224
   by 56 hexadecimal characters, SHA2-256 by 64 hexadecimal characters, 
   SHA2-384 by 96 hexadecimal characters, and SHA2-512 by 128

   hexadecimal characters. 


2.1.2 Limitations

   The Digest authentication scheme suffers from many known limitations
   as specified in RFC2617, section 3.1.4.  The update in this document
   does not address those limitations.


2.2 Specification of Digest Headers

   The modifications to the formats of the WWW-Authenticate Header line
   and the Authorization header line are specified below.


2.2.1 The WWW-Authenticate Response Header

   If a server receives a request for an access protected object, and an
   acceptable Authorization header is not sent, the server responds with
   a "401 Unauthorized" status code, and a WWW-Authenticate header.  The
   server MAY include multiple WWW-Authenticate headers to allow the
   server to utilize the best available algorithm supported by the
   client.     

   The algorithm directive is extended as follows:

      algorithm = "algorithm" "=" ("MD5" | "MD5-sess" |
                                   "SHA1" | "SHA1-sess" |	
                                   "SHA224" | "SHA224-sess" |
                                   "SHA256" | "SHA256-sess" |
                                   "SHA384" | "SHA384-sess" | 
                                   "SHA512" | "SHA512-sess" | 
                                   token)


   Algorithm
        A string indicating a pair of algorithms used to produce the
        digest and a checksum. If the algorithm parameter is not present
        it is assumed to be "MD5" to maintain backwards compatibility
        with existing implementations.  If the algorithm is not
        understood, the challenge should be ignored and a different
        challenge used if there is more than one.

        The string obtained by applying the digest algorithm to the data
        "data" with "secret" will be denoted KD(secret, data) and the
        string obtained by applying the checksum algorithm to the data
        "data" will be denoted H(data). The notation unq(x) means the

        value of the quoted string X without the surrounding quotes. 


        For the  "MD5 and "MD5-sess" algorithms
            H(data) = MD5(data)

        For the "SHA1" and "SHA1-sess" algorithms
            H(data) = SHA1(data)

        For the "SHA224" and "SHA224-sess" algorithms
            H(data) = SHA224(data)

        For the "SHA256" and "SHA256-sess" algorithms
            H(data) = SHA256(data)

        For the "SHA384" and "SHA384-sess" algorithms 
            H(data) = SHA384(data)

        For the "SHA512" and "SHA512-sess" algorithms
            H(data) = SHA512(data)


        and
            KD(secret, data) = H(concat(secret, ":", data))

        i.e the digest is the hash of the secret concatenated with a
        colon concatenated with the data. The " -sess" algorithm is
        intended to allow efficient 3rd party authentication servers;
        for the difference in usage see the description in section
        RFC2617, Section 3.2.2.2.


2.2.2 The Authorization Request Header

   The client is expected to retry the request, passing an Authorization
   Request Header line.  The Authorization Request Header line is
   modified as follows:


   request-digest	= <"> digest-size LHEX <">
   digest-size       = "32" | "40" | "56" | "64" | "96" | "128"


   The values of the opaque and algorithm fields must match those
   supplied in the WWW-Authenticate response header for the entity being
   requested.

            A string of hex digits as defined in RFC2617 which proves
            that the user knows a password.




2.3 Digest Operation 

   The modifications specified in this document does not introduce any
   change to the digest operation specified in RFC2617.


2.4 Security Protocol Operation

   When a server receives a request to access a resource, the server
   might challenge the client by responding with "401 Unauthorized"
   status code, and include one or more WWW-Authenticate headers. If the
   server challenges with multiple Digest headers, then each one of
   these headers MUST use a different digest algorithm. The server MUST
   add these Digest headers to the response in order of preference,
   starting with the most preferred header, followed by the less
   preferred headers.

   When the client receives the response it SHOULD use the topmost
   header that it supports, unless a local policy dictates otherwise.
   The client should ignore any challenge it does not understand.   


2.5 Example

   The following example is borrowed from RFC2617 and assumes that an
   access protected document is being requested from the server via a
   GET request.  The URI of the document is
   http://www.nowhere.org/dir/index.html". Both client and server know
   that the username for this document is "Mufasa" and the password is
   "Circle of Life" ( with one space between each of the three words). 

   The first time the client requests the document, no Authorization
   header is sent, so the server responds with:

        HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
                WWW-Authenticate: Digest 
                realm = "testrealm@host.com",
                qop="auth, auth-int",
                algorithm="SHA1",
                nonce=dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093", 
                opaque=5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40e41"

                WWW-Authenticate: Digest
                realm="testrealm@host.com",
                qop="auth, auth-int",
                algorithm="MD5",
                nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093",
                opaque="5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40ef41"

   The client may prompt the user for their username and password, after
   which it will respond with a new request, including the following
   Authorization header: 

        Authorization:Digest username="Mufasa",
        realm="testrealm@host.com"
        nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093",
        uri="/dir/index.html",
        qop=auth,
        algorithm="MD5"
        nc=00000001,
        cnonce="0a4f113b",
        response="6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1",
        opaque="5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40e41"




3  Security Considerations

   This specification updates the Digest Access Authentication scheme
   specified in RFC2617 to add support for the SHA1 and SHA2 algorithm
   suites.  Support for these additional hash algorithms does not alter
   the security properties of the Digest Access Authentication scheme.
