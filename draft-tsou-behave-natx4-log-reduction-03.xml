    <abstract>
      <t>
        Various IPv6 transition strategies require the introduction of 
        large-scale NATs (e.g. AFTR, NAT64) to share the limited supply of IPv4
        addresses available in the network until transition is complete. There
        has recently been debate over how to manage the sharing of ports
        between different subscribers sharing the same IPv4 address. One
        factor in the discussion is the operational requirement to log the
        assignment of transport addresses to subscribers. It has been argued
        that dynamic assignment of individual ports between subscribers
        requires the generation of an excessive volume of logs. This document
        suggests a way to achieve dynamic port sharing while keeping log
        volumes low.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
       During the IPv6 transition period, some large-scale NAT devices may be
       introduced, e.g. DS-Lite AFTR, NAT64. When a NAT device needs to set
       up a new connection for a given internal address behind the NAT, it
       needs to create a new mapping entry for the new connection, which will
       contain source IP address, source port, converted source IP address,
       converted source port, protocol (TCP/UDP), etc. If the connection is
       ICMP, a  mapping entry may include source IP address, converted source
       IP address, source identifier, converted source identifier, etc.
      </t>

      <t>
    	  For the purpose of troubleshooting, and also as required by regulations,
        operators must keep logs of network NAT mapping entries for a period of 
        time, e.g. 6 months or one year <xref target="RFC6269"/>, 
        so the NAT device needs to generate logs for mapping entries in addition 
        to other information. A traditional method is to generate a log for each 
        mapping entry. When a connection expires, the mapping entry will be deleted, 
        and the corresponding log is stored locally or sent to a log storage server.
      </t>

      <t>
        Some high performance NAT devices may need to create a large amount of
        new sessions per second. If logs are generated for each mapping entry, the
        log traffic could reach tens of megabytes per second or more, which would
        be a problem for log generation, transmission and storage.
      </t>

      <t>
        <xref target="I-D.behave-lsn-requirements"/>, REQ-13, REQ-14, and 
        REQ-15 deal explicitly with port allocation schemes. However, it is
        recognized that these are conflicting requirements, requiring a
        tradeoff between the efficiency with which ports are used and the rate
        of generation of log records.
      </t>

    <section anchor="proposal" title="A Suggested Solution">

      <t>   
        We propose a solution that allows dynamic sharing of port ranges
        between users while minimizing the number of logs that have to be 
        generated. Briefly, ports are allocated to the user in blocks. Logs 
        are generated only when blocks are allocated or deallocated. This 
        provides the necessary traceability while reducing log generation 
        by a factor equal to the block size, as compared with fully dynamic 
        port allocation.
      </t>

      <t> 
        Here is how the proposal would work in greater detail. When the user
        sends out the first packet, a port resource pool is allocated for the
        user, e.g. assign ports 2001~2300 of a public IP address to the user's
        resource pool. Only one log should be generated for this port block.
        When the NAT needs to set up a new mapping entry for the user, it can
        use a port in the user's resource pool and the corresponding public IP
        address. If the user needs more port resources, the NAT can allocate
        another port block, ports 3501~3800, to the user's resource pool.
        Again , just one log needs to be generated for this port block. A log
        may contain the following information: source IP address, converted
        source IP address, port range, start time, end time, and some other
        necessary information.   
      </t>

      <t> 
        There is an alternative way of allocating port blocks 
        <xref target="I-D.bajko-pripaddrassign"/>. The ports in a block do not
        have to be contiguous. Due to security concerns, the port numbers
        could be worked out using some random algorithm along with some
        initial parameters. The randomization algorithm would be applied at
        the NAT when it generates a new mapping. The algorithm and initial
        parameters together are required to define a discrete subset of the
        entire available port range (1024 to 65335), such that it is possible
        to assign the complete range to different internal addresses as
        required by varying the initial parameters. When generating a log
        message, these parameters instead of the upper and lower bounds of a
        port range would be included in the log.  
      </t>

      <t>
        Suppose now that a given internal address has been assigned more than
        one block of ports.  Regardless of whether the ports within a block
        are specified by a simple range or a random algorithm, it is clear
        that the overall preference for port randomization will be better
        achieved by spreading out new port assignments over all of the blocks
        assigned to that internal address. That means that the NAT should
        first select one of the assigned blocks pseudo-randomly before
        applying any randomization algorithm within the block. Further
        discussion of this point occurs below as part of the discussion of
        block deallocation.
      </t>

      <t> 
        The individual sessions using ports within a port block will start and
        end at different times. If no ports in some port block are used for
        some configurable time, the NAT can remove the port block from the
        resource pool allocated to a given internal address, and make it
        available for other users. The deallocation may be logged when it
        occurs, although some would view such logging as redundant.
      </t>

      <t> 
        The deallocation procedure presents a number of difficulties in
        practice. The first problem is the choice of timeout value for the
        block. If idle timers are applied for the individual mappings
        (sessions) within the block, and these conform to the recommendations
        for NAT behaviour for the protocol concerned, then the additional time
        that might be configured as a guard for the block as a whole need not
        be more than a few minutes. The block timer in this case serves only
        as a slightly more conservative extension of the individual session
        idle timers. If, instead, a single idle timer is used for the whole
        block, it must itself conform to the recommendations for the protocol
        with which that block of ports is associated. For example, REQ-5 of
        <xref target="RFC5382" /> requires an idle timer expiry duration of at
        least 2 hours and 4 minutes for TCP. 
      </t>
       
      <t>
        The next issue with port block deallocation is the conflict between
        the desire to randomize port allocation and the desire to make unused
        resources available to other internal addresses. As mentioned above,
        ideally port selection will take place over the entire set of blocks
        allocated to the internal address. However, taken to its fullest
        extent, such a policy will minimize the probability that all ports in
        any given block are idle long enough for it to be released. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
        As an alternative, it is suggested that when choosing which block to
        select a port from, the NAT should omit from its range of choice the
        block that has been idle the longest, unless no ports are available in
        any of the other blocks. The expression "block that has been idle the
        longest" designates the block in which the time since the last packet
        was observed in any of its sessions, in either direction, is earlier
        than the corresponding time in any of the other blocks assigned to
        that internal address. As <xref target="RFC6269"/> points out, port
        randomization is just one security measure of several, and the loss of
        randomness incurred by the suggested procedure is justified by the
        increased utilization of port resources it allows.
      </t>

    <section anchor="trac" title="Issues Of Traceability">   

     <t>
       The whole point of this proposal is to allow the NAT to support
       regulatory requirements for traceability of usage. So it is only right
       to verify that these requirements can be met with the proposal made in
       the previous section. There are two cases:
       <list style="numbers">
          <t> the investigating authority requires a complete record of the
          activities of a target individual; </t>
          <t> the investigating authority is concerned with tracking down the
          user responsible for wrongful behaviour at a specific end point (e.g.,
          server, individual user, enterprise network). </t>
       </list>
      </t>

      <t>
       Assuming that per-session logging at the NAT is to be avoided in
       general (the whole point of this document), the first requirement can
       only be met by identifying a target device in advance and enabling
       per-session logging for the internal address assigned to that device
       (... and variations for multi-address situations). This case is
       basically out of scope of this document.
      </t>

      <t>
        Section 11 of <xref target="RFC6269"/> provides a good discussion of
        the traceability issue. Complete traceability given the NAT logging
        practices proposed in this draft requires that the remote destination
        record the source port of a request along with the source address (and
        presumably protocol, if not implicit). In addition, the logs at each
        end must be timestamped, and the clocks must be synchronized within a
        certain degree of accuracy. Here is one reason for the guard timing on
        block release, to increase the tolerable level of clock skew between
        the two ends.
      </t>

      <t> The ability to configure various server applications to record
      source ports has been investigated, with the following results:
       <list style="symbols">
          <t> Source port recording can be configured in Apache, Postfix,
          sendmail and sshd. Please refer to the appendix for configuration
          guide.</t>
          <t> Source port recording is not supported by IIS, Cyrus IMAP and UW
          IMAP. But it should not be too difficult to get Cyrus IMAP and UW IMAP
          to support it by modifying the source code.</t>
        </list>
        Where source port logging can be enabled, this memo strongly urges the
        operators to do so. Similarly, intrusion detection systems should
        capture source port as well as source address of suspect packets.
      </t>

      <t>
        In some cases <xref target="RFC6269"/>, a server may not record the
        source port of a connection. To allow traceability, the NAT device
        needs to record the destination IP address of a connection. As <xref
        target="RFC6269"/> points out, this will provide an incomplete
        solution to the issue of traceability because multiple users of the
        same shared public IP address may access the service at the same time.
        From the point of view of this draft, in such situations the game is
        lost, so to speak, and port allocation at the NAT might as well be
        completely dynamic.
      </t>

      <t> 
        The final possibility to consider is where the NAT does not do per-
        session logging even given the possibility that the remote end is
        failing to capture source ports. In that case, the port allocation
        policy proposed in this draft can be used. The impact on traceability
        is that the investigating authority would be able to collect only the
        list of all internal addresses mapped to a given public address during
        the period of time concerned. This has an impact on privacy as well as
        traceability, depending on the follow-up actions taken by the
        investigating authority to achieve its objectives.

        of dynamic as opposed to static port assignment. For example, Section

        These issues must be resolved, but are not specific to the port
        allocation policy described in this document.
