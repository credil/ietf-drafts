1.  Introduction

   As the migration towards IPv6 continues, IPv6 only networks will
   become more prevalent.  However, IPv4 connectivity will continue to
   be provided as a service over these IPv6 only networks.  In addition
   to providing IPv4 addresses for clients of this service, other IPv4
   configuration parameters may also need to be provided, (e.g.
   addresses of IPv4-only services).

   By conveying DHCPv4 messages over DHCPv6 transport, this mechanism
   can achieve dynamic provisioning of IPv4 address and other
   configuration parameters.  In addition, it is able to leverage
   existing infrastructure for DHCPv4, e.g.  failover, DNS updates,
   leasequery, etc.  This mechanism is suitable for stateful allocation
   and management of IPv4 addresses and configuration parameters across
   IPv6 networks.

   Several approaches for provisioning such information have already
   been proposed.  This document describes alternative approach.

3.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   BOOTREQUESTV6 (TBD):  A new type of DHCPv6 Client/Server message
                         defined in this document.  A client sends a
                         BOOTREQUESTV6 message to a server, which
                         contains a BOOTP Message Option.  Each BOOTP
                         Message Option contains a BOOTREQUEST message
                         that the client uses to request IPv4
                         configuration parameters from the server.

   BOOTREPLYV6 (TBD):    A new type of DHCPv6 Client/Server message
                         defined in this document.  A server sends a
                         BOOTREPLYV6 message containing a BOOTP Message
                         Option in response to a client's BOOTREQUESTV6
                         message.  Each BOOTP Message Option, wrapped in
                         a BOOTREPLYV6 message, contains a BOOTREPLY
                         message.  This contains the BOOTREQUEST
                         response corresponding to a client's
                         BOOTREQUESTV6 message.

4.  Architecture Overview

   The architecture described in this document addresses a typical use
   case, whereby a DHCP client's uplink supports IPv6 only and the
   Service Provider's network supports IPv6 and limited IPv4 services.
   In this scenario, the client can only use the IPv6 network to access
   IPv4 services and so it must configure IPv4 services using IPv6 as
   the underlying transport protocol.

   Although the purpose of this document is to address the problem of
   communication between DHCPv4 client and DHCPv4 server, the mechanism
   it describes does not restrict the transported types of messages to
   DHCPv4.  BOOTP messages can be transported using the same mechanism.

   DHCP clients can be running on CPE devices, end hosts or any other
   device which supports the DHCP client function.  At the time of
   writing, DHCP clients on CPE devices are relatively easier to modify
   compared to those implemented on end hosts.  As a result, this
   document uses the CPE as an example for describing the mechanism.
   This doesn't preclude end hosts from implementing the mechanism in
   the future.

   This mechanism works by carrying encapsulated DHCPv4 messages over
   DHCPv6 messages.  Figure 1, below, illustrates one possible
   deployment architecture.

Internet-Draft             DHCPv4 over DHCPv6                 April 2013


   The DHCP client implements a new DHCPv6 message called BOOTREQUESTV6,
   which contains a new option called BOOTP Message Option.  The format
   of the option is described in Section 5.  The client sends all DHCPv6
   packets, including DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 packets, to the well-known
   All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address on the DHCPv6
   server port (UDP port 547).

   The DHCPv6 packet can be transmitted either via Relay Agents or
   directly to the server.  The server is referred in this document as a
   "Unified Server" for its capability of processing regular DHCPv6
   traffic as well as DHCPv4 packets wrapped in the BOOTP Message
   Option.  Server replies with a relevant DHCPv6 packet carrying DHCPv4
   response wrapped with the BOOTP Message Option.  Clients receive a
   response on UDP port 546.

5.  BOOTP Message Option Format

   The BOOTP Message option carries a BOOTP message that is sent by the
   client or the server.  Such BOOTP messages exclude any IP or UDP
   headers.

   The format of the BOOTP Message Option is:

     0                   1                   2                   3

                   In a BOOTREQUESTV6 message it contains a BOOTREQUEST
                   message sent by client.  In a BOOTREPLYV6 message it
                   contains a BOOTREPLY message sent by a server in
                   response to a client.

6.  Client Behavior

   When a client requires an IPv4 address and/or other IPv4
   configuration parameters, it MUST generate a DHCPv4 message to obtain
   them from a DHCP server.  This message is stored verbatim in the
   BOOTP Message Option carried by the BOOTREQUESTV6 message.  A Client
   MUST put exactly one BOOTP Message Option into a single BOOTREQUESTV6
   message.  The Client sends out the BOOTREQUESTV6 message to the Well-
   Known multicast address, i.e.  All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers on
   multicast address defined in [RFC3315].

   When a client receives a BOOTREPLYV6 message, it MUST look for the
   BOOTP Message Option within this message.  If this option is not
   found, the BOOTREPLYV6 message is discarded.  If the BOOTP Message
   Option is found, the client extracts the DHCPv4 message it contains
   and processes it as described in section 4.4 of [RFC2131].

   As the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 clients are running on the same host, the
   client MUST implement [RFC4361] to ensure that the device correctly
   identifies itself.

   The IPv4 address allocated from the server MAY be assigned to a
   different interface from the IPv6 interface requesting the
   information.  Future documents depending on this memo MUST specify
   which IPv6 interface is to be used by the client for that purpose.

7.  Relay Agent Behavior

   When a DHCPv6 relay agent receives a BOOTREQUESTV6 message, it MUST
   handle the message as described in section 20.1.1 of [RFC3315].

   A DHCPv6 relay agent MUST implement the Relay behaviour described in
   section 20.1.1 of [RFC3315].

   Additionally, the DHCPv6 relay agent MAY allow the configuration of a
   dedicated DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 specific destination addresses,
   differing from the addresses of the DHCPv6 only server(s).  To
   implement this function, the relay checks the received DHCPv6 message
   type and forwards according to the following logic:

   1.  If the message type is BOOTREQUESTV6, then the DHCPv6 request is
       relayed to the configured DHCPv4 aware unified server's
       address(es).

   2.  For any other DHCPv6 message type, forward according to section
       20 of [RFC3315].

   The above logic only allows for separate relay destinations
   configured on the relay agent closest to the client (single relay
   hop).  Multiple relaying hops are not considered in this document.

8.  Server Behavior

   When server receives a BOOTREQUESTV6 message from a client, it
   searches for a BOOTP Message Option.  If this option is missing, the
   server discards the packet.  The server MAY notify an administrator
   about the receipt of a malformed packet.  The mechanism for this
   notification is out of scope for this document

   If the server finds a valid BOOTP Message Option, it extracts the
   original DHCPv4 message sent by the client.  This message is passed
   to the DHCPv4 server engine, which generates a response to the client
   as specified in [RFC2131].  This engine can be implemented as a
   built-in DHCPv4 server function of the Unified Server, or it can be a
   separate DHCPv4 server instance.  Discussion regarding communication
   between the Unified Server and a DHCPv4 server engine is out of scope
   for this document.

   When appropriate DHCPv4 respose is generated, Unified Server places
   it in the payload of a BOOTP Message Option, which it puts into the
   BOOTREPLYV6 message.

   If the BOOTREQUESTV6 message was received directly by the server, the
   BOOTREPLYV6 message MUST be unicast from the interface on which the

Internet-Draft             DHCPv4 over DHCPv6                 April 2013


   original message was received.

   If the BOOTREQUESTV6 message was received in a Relay-forward message,
   the server creates a Relay-reply message with the BOOTREPLYV6 message
   in the payload of a Relay Message Option.  This is analogous to other
   types of DHCPv6 messages as described in [RFC3315].  The server
   unicasts the Relay-reply message directly to the IP address of the
   relay agent from which the Relay-forward message was received.

9.  Security Considerations

   In this specification, DHCPv4 messages are encapsulated in the newly
   defined option and messages.  This is similar to handling the current
   relay agent messages.  In order to bypass firewalls or network
   authentication gateways, a malicious attacker may leverage this
   feature to convey other messages using DHCPv6, i.e.  use DHCPv6 as a
   form of encapsulation.  However, the potential risk from this is no
   greater than that with current DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 practice.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is kindly requested to allocate one DHCPv6 option code to the
   OPTION_BOOTP_MSG and two DHCPv6 message type codes to the
   BOOTREQUESTV6 and BOOTREPLYV6.
