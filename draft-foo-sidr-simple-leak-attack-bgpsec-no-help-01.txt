Abstract

   This document describes a very simple attack vector that illustrates
   how RPKI-enabled BGPSEC machinery as currently defined can be easily
   circumvented in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack via
   BGP.  It is meant to serve as input to the IETF's Secure Inter-Domain
   Routing working group during routing security requirements
   discussions and subsequent specification.

Internet-Draft      Route Leak Attacks Against BGPSEC      November 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a very simple attack vector that illustrates
   how RPKI-enabled BGPSEC [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol] machinery as
   currently defined can be easily circumvented in order to launch a Man
   In The Middle (MITM) attack via BGP [RFC4271].  It is meant to serve
   as input to the IETF's SIDR Working Group during routing security
   requirements discussions and subsequent specification.

   The authors believe the capability to prevent leaks should be a
   first-order engineering objective in any secure routing architecture.


2.  Discussion

   Assume a multi-homed autonomous system (AS), AS 1, connects to two
   ISPs (ISP1 & ISP2), and wishes to insert themselves in the datapath
   between a target network (prefix P) connected to ISP2 and systems in
   ISP1's network in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack.
   Further assume that an RPKI-enabled BGPSEC
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol] as currently defined is fully
   deployed by all parties in this scenario and functioning as designed.

   Network operators on the Internet today typically prefer customer
   routes over routes learned from bi-lateral or settlement free peers.
   Network operators commonly accomplish this via application of one or
   more BGP [RFC4271] Path Attributes, most commonly, LOCAL_PREF as
   illustrated in [RFC1998], that are evaluated earlier in the BGP Path
   Selection process than AS_PATH length.

   As currently defined, BGPSEC only provides two functions:

   1.  Is an Autonomous System authorized to originate an IP prefix?
   2.  Is the AS_PATH represented in the route the same as the list of
       ASes through which the NLRI traveled?

   In order for an attacker (AS 1) to divert traffic from ISP1 for
   prefix P through their AS they simply fail to scope the propagation
   of the target prefix P (received from ISP2) by announcing a
   (syntactically correct) BGPSEC update for prefix P to ISP1.  This
   vulnerability is what the authors refer to as a 'route leak'.  It is
   important to note that the default behavior in BGP [RFC4271] is to
   announce all best paths to external BGP peers, unless explicitly
   scoped by a BGP speaker through configuration.  Because ISP1 prefers
   prefixes learned from customers (AS 1) over prefixes learned from
   peers (ISP2), they begin forwarding traffic for prefix P destinations
   through the attacker's AS (AS 1).  Voila!

   It should be understood that any multi-homed AS can potentially
   launch such an attack, even if through simple misconfiguration, as is
   a common occurrence today on the Internet.  Determination of benign
   versus malicious intent in these situations is usually imperceptible,
   and as such, preventative controls are requisite.  In an environment
   where BGPSEC is fully deployed there would be high assurance of the
   semantic integrity of the AS_PATH BGP Path attrubute, and as such, it
   should accurately reflect the attacker's AS number in the appropriate
   location of the AS_PATH; however, it would not prevent the attack.

   Discussion of out of band methods to mitigate this attack are beyond
   the scope of this document, as it's objective is to inform routing
   protocol design choices currently being considered within the IETF's
   SIDR Working Group.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes an attack on an RPKI-enabled BGPSEC and is
   meant to inform the IETF Secure Inter-Domain Routing working group on
   the vulnerabilty that exists as a result of "leaks".

   The authors believe the capability to prevent leaks should be a
   first-order engineering objective in any secure routing architecture.
