Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title              November 2013


1.  Introducao

   O protocolo SCOMMP pode ser implementado sobre qualquer rede sem
   roteamento, especialmente sobre redes RF half-duplex.  Na maior parte
   dos casos, modulos RF ja implementam algum protocolo parecido, mas e
   interessante utilziar o SCOMMP mesmo nestes casos, ja que isso ira
   permitir uma comunicacao menos dependente da camada fisica.


2.  O protocolo

   O protocolo SCOMMP estabelece comunicacao entre duas entidades, o
   cliente e o servidor.

                        Funcionamento do protocolo

          +-------------------+         +-----------------------+
          |      Cliente      | <-----> |       Servidor        |
          +-------------------+         +-----------------------+

           Comunicacao bidirecional entre o cliente e o servidor

                                 Figure 1

   The CDATA means you don't need to escape meta-characters (especially
   < (&lt;) and & (&amp;)) but is not essential.  Figures may also have
   a title attribute but it won't be displayed unless there is also an
   anchor.  White space, both horizontal and vertical, is significant in
   figures even if you don't use CDATA.


3.  Subsections and Tables

3.1.  A Subsection

   By default 3 levels of nesting show in table of contents but that can
   be adjusted with the value of the "tocdepth" processing instruction.

3.2.  Tables

   .. are very similar to figures:

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title              November 2013


     Tables use ttcol to define column headers and widths.  Every cell
                  then has a "c" element for its content.

                          +----------+----------+
                          | ttcol #1 | ttcol #2 |
                          +----------+----------+
                          |   c #1   |   c #2   |
                          |   c #3   |   c #4   |
                          |   c #5   |   c #6   |
                          +----------+----------+

                      which is a very simple example.

                       Table 1: A Very Simple Table


4.  More about Lists

   Lists with 'hanging labels': the list item is indented the amount of
   the hangIndent:

   short   With a label shorter than the hangIndent.

   fantastically long label  With a label longer than the hangIndent.

   vspace_trick
           Forces the new item to start on a new line.

   Simulating more than one paragraph in a list item using <vspace>:

   a.  First, a short item.

   b.  Second, a longer list item.

       And something that looks like a separate pararaph..

   Simple indented paragraph using the "empty" style:

             The quick, brown fox jumped over the lazy dog and lived to
             fool many another hunter in the great wood in the west.

4.1.  Numbering Lists across Lists and Sections

   Numbering items continuously although they are in separate <list>
   elements, maybe in separate sections using the "format" style and a
   "counter" variable.

   First list:

   R1  #1

   R2  #2

   R3  #3

   Specify the indent explicitly so that all the items line up nicely.

   Second list:

   R4  #4

   R5  #5

   R6  #6

4.2.  Where the List Numbering Continues

   List continues here.

   Third list:

   R7   #7

   R8   #8

   R9   #9

   R10  #10

   The end of the list.

5.  Example of Code or MIB Module To Be Extracted

   The <artwork> element has a number of extra attributes that can be
   used to substitute a more aesthetically pleasing rendition into HTML
   output while continuing to use the ASCII art version in the text and
   nroff outputs (see the xml2rfc README for details).  It also has a
   "type" attribute.  This is currently ignored except in the case
   'type="abnf"'.  In this case the "artwork" is expected to contain a
   piece of valid Augmented Backus-Naur Format (ABNF) grammar.  This
   will be syntax checked by xml2rfc and any errors will cause a fatal
   error if the "strict" processing instruction is set to "yes".  The
   ABNF will also be colorized in HTML output to highlight the syntactic
   components.  Checking of additional "types" may be provided in future
   versions of xml2rfc.


   /**** an example C program */

   #include <stdio.h>

   void
   main(int argc, char *argv[])
   {
       int i;

       printf("program arguments are:\n");
       for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
           printf("%d: \"%s\"\n", i, argv[i]);
       }

       exit(0);
   } /* main */

   /* end of file */

   This template was derived from an initial version written by Pekka
   Savola and contributed by him to the xml2rfc project.

   This document is part of a plan to make xml2rfc indispensable

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
   for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.


8.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
