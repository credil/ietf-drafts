                    draft-kundrat-qresync-arrived-00

Abstract

   This document updates the QRESYNC extension of the IMAP protocol to
   use a new untagged response, the ARRIVED one, to inform about the
   UIDs of newly arriving messages.  Deprecating the EXISTS response,
   this extension prevents a possible race condition where clients can
   lose synchronization of message UIDs in a selected mailbox when new
   arrivals are immediately expunged.

1.  Introduction

   The QRESYNC extension [RFC5162] introduces the VANISHED response, a
   UID-based supplement to the sequence-number-based EXPUNGED [RFC3501].
   The VANISHED response is also explicitly allowed to refer to non-
   existing message UIDs.  Such a situation present a possible race
   condition where clients could lose track of the sequence -> UID
   mapping where new arrivals are removed in a parallel session.

   This document updates the QRESYNC extension with a new response to be
   used instead of EXISTS, the ARRIVED one.  It also adds a mechanism
   for activating this extension and explains backward compatibility
   concerns.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Race Condition in QRESYNC

   This section illustrates an example where a fully-compliant QRESYNC
   client loses track of UIDs of some messages in its mailbox.

   Suppose a client has opened a mailbox using the SELECT ... QRESYNC
   command.  The mailbox contains a single message with UID 5; UIDNEXT
   is 11.  The client is fully synchronized with the server.  In this
   situation, the server informs client about new arrival:

                             S: * 3 EXISTS

Internet-Draft       IMAP QRESYNC-ARRIVED Extension          August 2012


   Upon receiving the EXISTS reponse, IMAP client would typically
   proceed towards discovering various message metadata like theirs UIDs
   and flags, either through the UID SEARCH ALL command, or via UID
   FETCH (FLAGS).  However, when the new arrivals are immediately
   expunged (perhaps as a result of an activity in a parallel session),
   the server can possibly process the request for additinal metadata
   only after the expunge has been reported to the client.  The VANISHED
   response actually complicates matter in this situation:

                          S: * VANISHED 12:20

   This response informs about permanent removal of messages with UIDs
   between 12 and 20, inclusively.  Unfortunately, as the VANISHED
   response is explicitly allowed to reference non-existing UIDs, the
   client doesn't know whether this VANISHED response affects two newly
   arriving messages.  Immediately after having received these two
   responses, the client cannot make any assumptions about the rest of
   the mailbox (i.e.  messages with UIDs > 6).  Specifically, any of the
   following can be true:

   o  The mailbox now contains only one message with UID 5

   o  The mailbox contains two messages; first of them has UID 5 and
      nothing is known about the other one

   o  The mailbox contains three messages; first of them has UID 5 and
      nothing is known about the rest of them

   In absence of the QRESYNC-ARRIVED extension or when talking to
   servers not offering that, clients MUST be prepared to work around
   the described race condition.  An example of such a behavior is
   issuing an explicit UID SEARCH command to rediscover the unclear
   portion of the sequence -> UID mapping:

                        S: * 3 EXISTS
                        S: * VANISHED 12:20
                        C: x UID SEARCH UID 11:*
                        S: * SEARCH
                        S: x OK Search completed

   A single search operation is enough to recover the complete UID
   mapping, but it induces unnecessary round trip before a full mapping
   can be established again.  In addition, clients would have to ignore
   any unsolicited FETCH responses not containing UID of the target
   message:

                       S: * 3 EXISTS
                       S: * 2 FETCH (FLAGS (foo))
                       S: * 3 FETCH (FLAGS (bar))
                       S: * VANISHED 12:20
                       C: x UID SEARCH UID 11:*
                       S: * SEARCH
                       S: x OK Search completed

Internet-Draft       IMAP QRESYNC-ARRIVED Extension          August 2012


   Clients have no chance but to ignore any FETCH response which affects
   messages whose UID is not yet known.

   This race condition can be avoided by switching to UID-based
   equivalent of EXISTS, the ARRIVED response.  Alternatively, the same
   goal would be achieved if the QRESYNC specification mandated that
   VANISHED responses MUST NOT refer to UIDs which were not present in
   the mailbox at the time immediately before the VANISHED response was
   generated.

3.  IMAP Protocol Changes

3.1.  QRESYNC-ARRIVED Parameter to SELECT/EXAMINE

   The QRESYNC-ARRIVED parameter to SELECT/EXAMINE commands shares
   syntax with the QRESYNC parameter defined in [RFC5162]; the only
   exception is that it is identified by the "QRESYNC-ARRIVED" atom.

   For backward compatibility, IMAP servers supporting this extension
   MUST support QRESYNC as defined by [RFC5162].  In addition, such
   servers SHOULD NOT sent VANISHED responses containing UIDs of
   messages which were expunged before, and SHOULD NOT send the untagged
   EXPUNGED instead of VANISHED.

3.2.  ARRIVED Response

   Contents:  ordered list of UIDs

   The ARRIVED response reports that the specified UIDs have been
   delivered to the mailbox.  It is similar in functionality to the
   EXISTS response [RFC3501]; however, it can return information about
   multiple messages, and it returns UIDs instead of message numbers.
   The first benefit saves bandwidth, while the second elliminates the
   potential of client losing track of assigned UIDs in a mailbox.

   If the client has opened the mailbox with the QRESYNC-ARRIVED
   parameter to SELECT/EXAMINE command, the EXISTS response MUST be
   still sent during the initial mailbox synchronization, i.e.  between
   having received the SELECT or EXAMINE command and the corresponding
   tagged response, as in [RFC3501].  Servers MAY send the EXISTS
   response several times, but they SHOULD send it only once to conserve
   resources.  The number given in the EXISTS response MUST NOT shrink.
   The clients MUST treat the last occurence as the final data.

   Servers MUST NOT issue ARRIVED prior to issuing a tagged OK for the
   SELECT/EXAMINE command to prevent uncertanities about the
   HIGHESTMODSEQ value.  New arrivals since the last time the mailbox
   has been selected are reported using FETCH responses with embedded
   UID, as in regular QRESYNC.

Internet-Draft       IMAP QRESYNC-ARRIVED Extension          August 2012


   After the mailbox has been selected, all further updates about new
   arrivals MUST use the ARRIVED response.  If servers were allowed to
   fall back to untagged EXISTS, the possibility of race conditions
   would return.

   UIDs sent in the ARRIVED response must be always presented in a
   sorted order, lowest UID first.  The sequence MUST NOT contain
   duplicate UIDs.  Servers SHOULD take advantage of the compression
   capabilities of the sequence-set syntax and use the range syntax if
   possible.

   The ARRIVED response MUST NOT be sent unless the client has passed
   the QRESYNC-ARRIVED option to the last SELECT or EXAMINE command.

4.  Acknowledgements

   This text builds upon the QRESYNC IMAP extension [RFC5162].

5.  IANA Considerations

   IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a standards track or
   IESG approved experimental RFC.  The registry is currently located
   at:

   http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities

   This document defines the QRESYNC-ARRIVED IMAP capability.  IANA will
   be asked to add this capability to the registry.

6.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC5234].

   Non-terminals referenced but not defined below are as defined by
   [RFC3501], [RFC5162], or [RFC5234].

   capability          =/ "QRESYNC-ARRIVED"
   
   select-param        =/ "QRESYNC-ARRIVED" SP "(" uidvalidity SP
                          mod-sequence-value [SP known-uids]
                          [SP seq-match-data] ")"
                          ;; conforms to the generic select-param
                          ;; syntax defined in [IMAPABNF]
   
   message-data        =/ arrived-resp
   
   arrived-resp        = "ARRIVED" SP sorted-sequence-set
   
   sorted-sequence-set = sequence-set
                       ;; sequence of UIDs, "*" is not allowed
                       ;; UIDs must be sorted, lowest first, no duplicates

Internet-Draft       IMAP QRESYNC-ARRIVED Extension          August 2012


7.  Security Considerations

   This extensions adds no functionality on top of what is already
   defined in the QRESYNC extension, and therefore we believe that no
   additional security implications have to be considered.
