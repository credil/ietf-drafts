                              Using DMARC
                       draft-crocker-dmarc-bcp-00

Abstract

   Email abuse often relies on unauthorized use of a domain name, such
   as one belonging to a well-known company (brand).  SPF and DKIM
   provide basic domain name authentication methods for email.  A recent
   industry effort built an additional authentication-based layer,
   called Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance
   (DMARC).  It allows a sender to indicate that their emails are
   protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and tells a receiver what to do if
   neither of those authentication methods passes; it also provides a
   reporting mechanism, from receivers back to domain owners.  Such
   capabilities over the public Internet are unusual and their use is
   not yet well-understood.  This document formulates a set of best
   practices for the use of DMARC.

1.  Introduction

   Email abuse often relies on unauthorized use of a domain name, such
   as one belonging to a well-known company (brand).  SPF [RFC4408] and
   DKIM [RFC6376] provide basic domain name authentication methods for
   email.  A recent industry effort [DMARC.ORG] built an additional
   authentication-based layer, called Domain-based Message
   Authentication, Reporting & Conformance.  [DMARC] allows a sender to
   indicate that their emails are protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and
   tells a receiver what to do if neither of those authentication
   methods passes; it also provides a reporting mechanism, from
   receivers back to domain owners.  Such capabilities over the public
   Internet are unusual and their use is not yet well-understood.  This
   document formulates a set of best practices for the use of DMARC.

   Discussion is divided along basic lines of activity:

   o  Development

   o  DNS Configuration

   o  Receiver Processing

   o  Report Generation

   This initial version of the document is primarily meant to seed
   discussion, rather than offer complete consideration of the topic...
   Besides obviously soliciting more content and discussion, a review of
   the document's organization is strongly requested.

   An IETF mailing list for discussing DMARC issues has been requested:
   dmarc@ietf.org.

2.  Development

   {This section is meant for any software development practices,
   relevant to the use of DMARC.  -ed}

3.  DNS Configuration

   o  Malformed DMARC policy TXT records in DNS.

         Can these be used for anything?

         Should a policy that does not conform to the spec be ignored?

         Is there any benefit in attempting to infer meaning (monitor =
         none, non = ??, rejec = ??)

         How lenient can one safely be as regards spacing, quotes,
         separators and slashes?

         Is there anyway I can report the malformation to the domain
         owner?

4.  Receiver Processing

   o  Rapid adoption of DMARC by apparent spammers

         Thousands upon thousands of DMARC records published by abusive
         domains -- probably wildcarding, but it works out the same

         Using data that is several weeks old, we have a handful of
         domains that are accepting aggregate reports for over 20
         thousand subdomains each

         Are the reports (either aggregate or forensic) providing the
         spammers insight that they did not already have?

         ***POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC QUESTION TO FOLLOW*** Should I only
         send reports to domains that I trust?

5.  Report Generation

   o  Minimum requirements for aggregate report XML documents

         What is the bare minimum (in terms of data gleaned from a given
         email) I need to produce a valid report?

         What sections of the XML need to be repeated when there is a
         new aggregation point (email from a different IP, for example)

         Essentially this could be considered "XML for people who
         thought they could figure out how to read an XSD but reality
         crashed that party."

   o  Minimum requirements for forensic reports (soft-fail reports)

         What is the bare minimum required to produce a forensic report.

6.  Miscellaneous

   This section is meant as a catch-all, for items that haven't yet been
   assigned to their appropriate section.

   o  Performing remote destination checking

         What happens if I don't?

   o  Identifier alignment

         {This has been cited, but not yet explained, as a potential BCP
         issue.  -ed}

   o  Owner vs.  Operator

         {It is possible that there are distinctive practices for domain
         name owners, versus agents that operate DNS or email services
         on behalf of the name owner.  -ed}

7.  Security Considerations

   o  DNS Abuse

         Most probably don't see this, but adding potentially multiple
         new DNS lookups per email multiplies rapidly

         DNS Cache can only help for so long

         Agg reports are (probably) created from some other host

         If Org Domain policy lookups are required, you may get two
         lookups every time there is a single lookup
