               RTCP Extension for Third-party Loss Report
             draft-ietf-avtcore-feedback-supression-rtp-14

Abstract

   In a large RTP session using the RTCP feedback mechanism defined in
   RFC 4585, a feedback target may experience transient overload if some
   event causes a large number of receivers to send feedback at once.
   This overload is usually avoided by ensuring that feedback reports
   are forwarded to all receivers, allowing them to avoid sending
   duplicate feedback reports.  However, there are cases where it is not
   recommended to forward feedback reports, and this may allow feedback
   implosion.  This memo discusses these cases and defines a new RTCP
   third-party loss report that can be used to inform receivers that the
   feedback target is aware of some loss event, allowing them to
   suppress feedback.  Associated SDP signalling is also defined.

Internet-Draft           Third Party Loss Report              March 2012


1.  Introduction

   RTCP feedback messages [RFC4585] allow the receivers in an RTP
   session to report events and ask for action from the media source (or
   a delegated feedback target when using unicast RTCP feedback with SSM
   [RFC5760]).  There are cases where multiple receivers may initiate
   the same, or an equivalent message towards the same media source or
   the same feedback target.  When the receiver count is large, this
   behavior may cause transient overload of the media source, the
   network or both.  This is known as a "feedback storm" or a "NACK
   storm".  One common cause of such a feedback storm is receivers
   utilizing RTP retransmission [RFC4588] as a packet loss recovery
   technique, sending feedback using RTCP NACK messages [RFC4585]
   without proper dithering of the retransmission requests (e.g., not
   implementing the RFC 4585 dithering rules or sending NACKs to a
   feedback target that doesn't redistribute them to other receivers).

   Another use case involves video Fast Update requests.  A storm of
   these feedback messages can occur in conversational multimedia
   scenarios like multipoint video switching conference [RFC4587].  In
   this scenario, the receiver may lose synchronization with the video
   stream when speaker is changed in the middle of session.  Poorly
   designed receivers that blindly issue fast update requests (i.e.,
   Full Intra Request (FIR) described in RFC5104 [RFC5104]), can cause
   an implosion of FIR requests from receivers to the same media source.

   RTCP feedback storms may cause short term overload, and in extreme
   cases to pose a possible risk of increasing network congestion on the
   control channel (e.g.  RTCP feedback), the data channel, or both.  It
   is therefore desirable to provide a way of suppressing unneeded
   feedback.  This document specifies a new third-party loss report for
   this function.  It supplements the existing the use of RTCP NACK
   packet and further is more precise in the uses where the network is
   active to suppress feedback.  It tells receivers explicitly that
   feedback for a particular packet or frame loss is not needed for a
   period of time and can provide an early indication before the
   receiver reacts to the loss and invokes its packet loss repair
   machinery.  Section 6 provides some examples of when to send the
   Third Party Loss Report message.

3.  Protocol Overview

   This document extends the RTCP feedback messages defined in the RTP/
   AVPF [RFC4585] defining a RTCP Third Party Loss Report (TPLR)
   message.  The RTCP TPLR message can be used by the intermediaries to
   inform the receiver that the sender of the RTCP TPLR has received
   reports that the indicated packets were lost, and asks the receiver
   not to send feedback to it regarding these packets.  Intermediaries
   are variously referred to as Distribution source, Burst/
   Retransmission Sources (BRS), MCUs, RTP translator, or RTP mixers,
   depending on the precise use case described Section 6.

   RTCP TPLR follows the similar format of message type as RTCP NACK or
   Full Intra Request Command.  However, the RTCP TPLR is defined as an
   indication that the sender of the feedback has received reports that
   the indicated packets were lost, while NACK [RFC4585] just indicates
   that the sender of the NACK observed that these packets were lost.
   The RTCP TPLR message is generated by an intermediary that may not
   have seen the actual packet loss.  It is sent following the same
   timing rule as sending NACK defined in RFC4585 [RFC4585].  The RTCP
   TPLR message may be sent in a regular full compound RTCP packet or in
   an early RTCP packet, as per the RTP/AVPF rules.  Intermediaries in
   the network that receive a RTCP TPLR SHOULD NOT send their own
   additional Third Party Loss Report messages for the same packet
   sequence numbers.  They SHOULD simply forward the RTCP TPLR message
   received from upstream direction to the receiver(s), additionally,
   they may generate their own RTCP TPLR that reports a set of the
   losses they see, which are different from ones reported in the RTCP
   TPLR they received.  The RTCP TPLR does not have the retransmission
   request [RFC4588] semantics.

Internet-Draft           Third Party Loss Report              March 2012


   When a receiver gets a RTCP TPLR message, it MUST follow the rules
   for NACK suppression in RFC 4585 if the message is integrity
   protected and authenticated and refrain from sending a feedback
   request (e.g., NACK or FIR) for the missing packets reported in the
   message,which is dealt with in the same way as receiving NACK.

   To increase the robustness to the loss of a TPLR, The RTCP TPLR may
   be retransmitted.  If the additional TPLR arrives at receiver, the
   receiver SHOULD deal with the additional TPLR in the same way as
   receiving the first TPLR for the same packet and no additional
   behavior for receiver is required.

   A receiver may have sent a Feedback message according to the RTP/AVPF
   scheduling algorithm of RFC4585 [RFC4585] before receiving a RTCP
   TPLR message, but further feedback messages for those sequence
   numbers SHOULD be suppressed for a period of time after receiving the
   RTCP TPLR.  Nodes that do not understand the RTCP TPLR message will
   ignore it, and might therefore still send feedback according to the
   AVPF scheduling algorithm of RFC4585 [RFC4585].  The media source or
   intermediate nodes cannot be certain that the use of a RTCP TPLR
   message actually reduces the amount of feedback it receives.


4.  Format of RTCP Feedback Messages

   This document introduces two new RTCP Feedback messages for Third
   Party Loss Report.  Applications that are employing one or more loss-
   repair methods MAY use the RTCP TPLR together with their existing
   loss-repair methods either for every packet they expect to receive,
   or for an application-specific subset of the RTP packets in a
   session.  In other words, receivers MAY ignore RTCP TPLR messages,
   but SHOULD react to them unless they have good reason to still send
   feedback messages despite having been requested to suppress them.

   The following two sections each define a RTCP TPLR message.  Both
   messages are feedback messages as defined in section 6.1 of RFC4585
   [RFC4585], and use the header format defined there.  Each section
   defines how to populate the PT, FMT,length SSRC of packet sender,
   SSRC of media source, and FCI fields in that header.

4.1.  Transport Layer Feedback:  Third Party Loss Report (TPLR)

   This TPLR message is identified by RTCP packet type value PT=RTPFB
   and FMT=TBA1.

   Within the common packet header for feedback messages (as defined in
   section 6.1 of RFC4585 [RFC4585]), the "SSRC of packet sender" field
   indicates the source of the request, and the "SSRC of media source"

Internet-Draft           Third Party Loss Report              March 2012


   denotes the media sender of the flow for which the indicated losses
   are being suppressed.

   The Feedback Control Information (FCI) field MUST contain one or more
   entries of transport layer third party loss Early Indication (TLLEI).
   Each entry applies to the same media source identified by the SSRC
   contained in the SSRC of media source field of Feedback header.  The
   length field in the TLLEI feedback message MUST be set to 2+1*N,
   where N is the number of FCI entries.

   The FCI field for TLLEI uses the similar format of message Types
   defined in the section 6.2.1 of RFC4585 [RFC4585].  The format is
   shown in Figure 1.

         0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Figure 1: Syntax of an FCI Entry in the TLLEI Feedback Message

   Packet ID (PID): 16 bits

      The PID field is used to specify a lost packet.  The PID field
      refers to the RTP sequence number of the lost packet.

   bitmask of lost packets (BLP): 16 bits

      The BLP allows for reporting losses of any of the 16 RTP packets
      immediately following the RTP packet indicated by the PID.  The
      BLP's definition is identical to that given in the section 6.2.1
      of [RFC4585].


4.2.  Payload Specific Feedback: Third Party Loss Report (TPLR)

   This TPLR message is identified by RTCP packet type value PT=PSFB and
   FMT=TBA2, which is used to suppress FIR [RFC5104] and PLI [RFC4585].

   Within the common packet header for feedback messages (as defined in
   section 6.1 of RFC4585 [RFC4585]), the "SSRC of packet sender" field
   indicates the source of the request, and the "SSRC of media source"
   is not used and SHALL be set to 0.  The SSRCs of the media senders to
   which this message applies are in the corresponding FCI entries.

   The FCI field for a Payload Specific Third Party Loss Early
   Indication (PSLEI) consists one or more FCI entries.  Each entry

   applies to a different media Source, identified by its SSRC. the
   content of which is depicted in Figure 2.  The length field in the
   PSLEI feedback message MUST be set to 2+1*N, where N is the number of
   FCI entries.

   The format is shown in Figure 2.

      synchronization with the media stream and for which the PSLEI
      receiver's own response to any such error is suppressed.



5.  SDP Signaling

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] attribute, rtcp-fb,
   is defined in the Section 4 of RFC4585 [RFC4585] and may be used to
   negotiate the capability to handle specific AVPF commands and
   indications.  The ABNF for rtcp-fb is described in section 4.2 of
   RFC4585 [RFC4585].  In this section, we extend the rtcp-fb attribute
   to include the commands and indications that are described for third
   party loss report in the present document.

   In the ABNF [RFC5234] for rtcp-fb-val defined in RFC4585 [RFC4585],
   the feedback type "nack", without parameters, indicates use of the
   Generic NACK feedback format as defined in Section 6.2.1of RFC4585
   [RFC4585].  In this document, we define two parameters that indicate
   the third party loss supported for use with "nack", namely:

   o  "tllei" denotes support of transport layer third party loss early
      indication.

   o  "pslei" denotes support of payload specific third party loss early
      indication.

   The ABNF for these two parameters for "nack" is defined here (please
   refer to section 4.2 of RFC4585 [RFC4585] for complete ABNF syntax).

   Refer to Section 4.2 of RFC4585 [RFC4585] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-fb" attribute.


6.  Example Use Cases

   The operation of feedback suppression is similar for all types of RTP
   sessions and topologies [RFC5117], however the exact messages used
   and the scenarios in which suppression is employed differ for various
   use cases.  The following sections outline some of the intended use
   cases for using the Third Party Loss Report for feedback suppression
   and give an overview of the particular mechanisms.

6.1.  Source Specific Multicast (SSM) use case

   In SSM RTP sessions as described in "RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
   Extensions for Single-Source Multicast Sessions with Unicast
   Feedback" [RFC5760], one or more Media Sources send RTP packets to a
   Distribution Source.  The Distribution Source relays the RTP packets
   to the receivers using a source- specific multicast group.

   As outlined in the RFC5760 [RFC5760], there are two Unicast Feedback
   models that may be used for reporting, the Simple Feedback model and
   the Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model.  In the simple
   Feedback Model, there's no need for distribution source to create the
   RTCP TPLRs, instead, RTCP NACKs are reflected by the distribution
   source to the other Receivers.  However in the Distribution Source
   Feedback Summary model, the distribution source will not redistribute
   the NACK for some reason(e.g., to prevent revealing the identity or
   existence of a system sending NACK)and may send a RTCP TPLR message
   to the systems that were unable to receive the NACK, and won't
   receive the NACK via other means.  The RTCP TPLR can be generated at
   the distribution source when downstream loss is reported (e.g.,
   downstream loss report is received), which indicates to the receivers
   that they should not transmit feedback messages for the same loss
   event for a certain time.  Therefore the distribution source in the



Wu, et al.              Expires September 3, 2012               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft           Third Party Loss Report              March 2012


   feedback summary model can be reasonably certain that it will help
   the situation (i.e., unable receive the NACK) by sending this RTCP
   TPLR message to all the relevant receivers impacted by the packet
   loss.

6.2.  Unicast based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast Stream (RAMS) use
      case

   The typical RAMS architecture [RFC6285] may have several Burst/
   Retransmission Sources(BRS) behind the multicast source (MS) placed
   at the same level.  These BRSes will receive the primary multicast
   RTP stream from the media source and cache most recent packets after
   joining multicast session.  If packet loss happens at the upstream of
   all the BRSs or the downstream of BRSes.  One of the BRSes or all the
   BRSes may send a RTCP NACK or RTCP TPLR message to the DS, where the
   SSRC in this RTCP NACK or RTCP TPLR message is the BRS that is
   sending the message.  The DS forwards/reflects this message down on
   the primary SSM.  The details on how DS deal with this message is
   specified in [RETRANSMISSION-FOR-SSM].

6.3.  RTP Transport Translator use case

   A Transport Translator (Topo-Trn-Translator), as defined in RFC5117
   [RFC5117] is typically forwarding the RTP and RTCP traffic between
   RTP clients, for example converting from multicast to unicast for
   domains that do not support multicast.  The translator may suffer a
   loss of important video packets.  In this case, the translator may
   forward RTCP TPLR message received from upstream in the same way as
   forwarding other RTCP traffic.  If the translator acting as the
   monitor [MONARCH] is aware of packet loss, it may use the SSRC of
   monitor as packet sender SSRC to create NACK message and send it to
   the receivers that are not aware of packet loss.

6.4.  Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) use case

   When the speaker is changed in a voice-activated multipoint video
   switching conference [RFC4587], an RTP mixer can be used to select
   the available input streams and forward them to each participants.
   If the MCU is doing a blind switch without waiting for a
   synchronization point on the new stream it can send a FIR to the new
   video source.  In this case the MCU should send a FIR suppression
   message to the new receivers. e.g., when the RTP Mixer starts to
   receive FIR from some participants it can suppress the remaining
   session participants from sending FIR by sending out a RTCP TPLR
   message.

6.5.  Mixer use case

   A Mixer, in accordance with RFC5117 [RFC5117], aggregates multiple
   RTP streams from other session participants and generates a new RTP
   stream sent to the session participants.  In some cases, the video
   frames may get badly screwed up between media source and the mixer.
   In such case, the mixer need to check if the packet loss will result
   in PLI or FIR transmissions from most of the group by analyzing the
   received video.  If so the mixer may initiate FIR or PLI towards the
   media source on behalf of all the session participants and send out a
   RTCP TPLR message to these session participants that may or are
   expected to send a PLI or FIR.  Alternatively, when the mixer starts
   to receive FIR or PLI from some participants and like to suppress the
   remaining session participants from sending FIR or PLI by forwarding
   the FIR/PLI from one session participant to others.


7.  Security Considerations

   The defined messages have certain properties that have security
   implications.  These must be addressed and taken into account by
   users of this protocol.

   Spoofed or maliciously created feedback messages of the type defined
   in this specification can have the following implications:

   Sending the spurious Third Party Loss Report packet(e.g., the RTCP
   TPLR with the wrong sequence number of lost packet) that causes
   missing RTP packets to not be repaired in a timely fashion.  If a
   receiver accepts such unauthenticated packet, an attacker could cause
   packet loss disrupting an important part of a session, preemptively
   sending feedback suppression.  An attacker that is also a receiver
   has enough information to suppress all the feedbacks from any other
   listeners that don't accept unauthenticated packets.

   To prevent these attacks, there is a need to apply authentication and
   integrity protection of the feedback messages.  This can be
   accomplished against threats external to the current RTP session
   using the RTP profile that combines Secure RTP [RFC3711] and AVPF
   into SAVPF [RFC5124].

   Note that intermediaries that are not visible at the RTP layer that
   wish to send the Third Party Loss Reports on behalf of the media
   source can only do so if they spoof the SSRC of the media source.
   This is difficult in case SRTP is in use.  If the intermediary is
   visible at the RTP layer, this is not an issue, provided the
   intermediary is part of the security context for the session.

   Also note that endpoints that receive a Third Party Loss Report would
   be well-advised to ignore it, unless the security is in place to
   authenticate the sender of the Third Party Loss Report.  Accepting
   Third Party Loss Report from un-authenticated sender can lead to a
   denial of service attack, where the endpoint accepts poor quality
   media that could be repaired.


8.  IANA Consideration

   This document instructs IANA to add two values in "ack" and "nack"
   Attribute Values registry for use with "nack"[RFC4585]:

  The value registration for the attribute value "nack":

       Value name:     tllei
       Long name:      Transport Layer Third Party Loss Early Indication
       Usable with:    nack
       Reference:      RFC 4585.

       Value name:     pslei
       Long name:      Payload Specific Third Party
       Usable with:    nack
       Reference:      RFC 4585.

   The following value have been registered as one FMT value in the "FMT
