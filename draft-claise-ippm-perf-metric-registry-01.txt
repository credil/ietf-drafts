1.  Open Issues

   1.  Check whether the "Initial Set of Performance Metrics" is up to
       date with the latest Performance Metrics published in XRBLOCK.

   2.  Do we want to organize the Performance Metrics list into
       different layers?  IP, transport layer stats, application stats,
       etc?

   3.  "IPPM Performance Metric Mapping Experiment" for IPDV must be
       validated.

   4.  The community will have to agree on which Performance Metrics
       (along with the specific values of the measurements parameters)
       are operationally relevant

   5.  Define "Measurement Parameter"

2.  Introduction

   The IETF specifies and uses Performance Metrics of protocols and
   applications transported over its protocols.  Performance metrics are
   such an important part of the operations of IETF protocols that
   [RFC6390] specifies guidelines for their development.

   The definition and use of performance metrics in the IETF happens in
   various working groups (WG), most notably:

      The "IP Performance Metris" (IPPM) WG [IPPM] is the WG primarily
      focusing on Peformance Metrics definition at the IETF.

      The "Metric Blocks for use with RTCP's Extended Report Framework"
      WG [XRBLOCK] recently specified many Peformance Metrics related to
      "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)" [RFC3611], which
      establishes a framework to allow new information to be conveyed in
      RTCP, supplementing the original report blocks defined in "RTP: A
      Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications", [RFC3550].

      The "Benchmarking Methodology" WG [BMWG] proposed some Peformance
      Metrics part of the benchmarking methodology.

      The "IP Flow Information eXport" (IPFIX) WG [IPFIX] Information
      elements related to performance metrics are currently proposed.

      The "Performance Metrics for Other Layers" (PMOL) concluded WG
      [PMOL], defined some Peformance Metrics related to Session
      Initiation Protocol (SIP) voice quality [RFC6035].

   It is expected that more and more Performance Metrics will be defined
   in the future, not only IP based metrics, but also protocol-specific
   and application-specific ones.

   However, despite the abundance and importance of performance metrics,
   there are still some problems for the industry: first, how to
   discover which Performance Metrics have already specified, and
   second, how to avoid Performance Metrics redefinition.  Only someone
   with a broad IETF knowledge would be able to find its way among all
   the different Performance Metrics specified in the different WGs.
   The way in which IETF manages namespaces is with IANA registries, and
   there is currently no Peformance Metrics Registry in IANA.

   This document specifies an IANA registry for Performance Metrics,
   along with the initial content, taken from the Performance Metrics
   already specified at the IETF.  Firstly, from the Performance Metrics
   already specified by the RFC630 template (mentioned later on in the
   document), and secondly from the existing set of IPPM Performance
   Metrics.  This second category requires a mapping to the RFC6390
   template.  This Performance Metric Registry is applicable to
   Performance Metrics issued from active monitoring, passive
   monitoring, or from the end point calculation.  Therefore, it must
   relevant to work developed in the following WGs: IPPM, LMAP, XRBLOCK,
   BMWG, and IPFIX.  Finally, this document gives a set of guidelines
   for Performance Metrics requesters and reviewers.

   Based on [RFC5226] Section 4.3, this document is processed as Best
   Current Practice (BCP) [RFC2026].

   The IPPM Metrics Registry [RFC4148] was an attempt to create such a
   Performance Metrics registry.  However, that registry was
   reclassified as obsolete with [RFC6248], "RFC 4148 and the IP
   Performance Metrics (IPPM) Registry of Metrics Are Obsolete", and
   consequently withdrawn.

   A couple of interesting quotes from RFC 6248 might help understand
   the issues related to that registry.

   1.  "It is not believed to be feasible or even useful to register
       every possible combination of Type P, metric parameters, and
       Stream parameters using the current structure of the IPPM Metrics
       Registry."

   2.  "The registry structure has been found to be insufficiently
       detailed to uniquely identify IPPM metrics."

   3.  "Despite apparent efforts to find current or even future users,
       no one responded to the call for interest in the RFC 4148
       registry during the second half of 2010."

2.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The terms Performance Metric and Performance Metrics Directorate are
   direct quotes from [RFC6390], and copied over in this document for
   the readers convenience.

   Performance Metric:  A Performance Metric is a quantitative measure
      of performance, specific to an IETF-specified protocol or specific
      to an application transported over an IETF-specified protocol.
      Examples of Performance Metrics are the FTP response time for a
      complete file download, the DNS response time to resolve the IP
      address, a database logging time, etc.

   Performance Metrics Directorate:  The Performance Metrics Directorate
      is a directorate that provides guidance for Performance Metrics
      development in the IETF.  The Performance Metrics Directorate
      should be composed of experts in the performance community,
      potentially selected from the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM),
      Benchmarking Methodology (BMWG), and Performance Metrics for Other
      Layers (PMOL) WGs.

   Performance Metrics Registry:  The IANA registry containing the
      Performance Metrics.  This registry is initially populated from
      this document.

   Measurement Parameter:  NOT SURE HOW TO DEFINE THIS

3.  Guidelines for Performance Metric Requesters and Reviewers

3.1.  Performance Metrics Template

   "Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development",
   [RFC6390] defines a framework and a process for developing
   Performance Metrics for protocols above and below the IP layer (such
   as IP-based applications that operate over reliable or datagram
   transport protocols).  These metrics can be used to characterize
   traffic on live networks and services.  As such, RFC 6390 does not
   define any Performance Metrics.

   RFC 6390 scope covers guidelines for the Performance Metrics
   directorate members for considering new Performance Metrics and
   suggests how the Performance Metrics Directorate will interact with
   the rest of the IETF.  Its mission is mentioned at
   [performance-metrics-directorate].  In practice, a weekly cron job
   discovers all the IETF drafts that refers to RFC 6390, or that
   contains the keyword "performance metric".  Once discovered, the
   different drafts are assigned a Performance Metric Directorate
   reviewer.  One of the primary task is to ensure that the RFC 6390
   template is correctly applied, making sure that the Performance
   Metric semantic is correctly specified.

   RFC 6390, specified in Section 5.4, proposes a template for
   Performance Metrics specifications:

   Normative

   o  Metric Name

   o  Metric Description

   o  Method of Measurement or Calculation

Internet-Draft            PERF-METRIC REGISTRY              October 2013


   o  Units of Measurement

   o  Measurement Point(s) with potential Measurement Domain

   o  Measurement Timing

   Informative

   o  Implementation

   o  Verification

   o  Use and Applications

   o  Reporting Model

   The template specified in Section 5.4 of "Guidelines for Considering
   New Performance Metric Development", [RFC6390] MUST be used as a
   basis for the Performance Metrics Registry Definition.

3.2.  Other Guidelines

   RFC 6390 lacks a naming convention for Performance Metrics, but
   specifies that "Performance Metric names are RECOMMENDED to be unique
   within the set of metrics being defined for the protocol layer and
   context.".  Imposing an unique Performane Metric name, while ideal,
   is not practicable in real live.  Indeed, some metrics have already
   been specified, and the name clashes appeared already.  Therefore,
   all Performance Metrics specified in the registry MUST have an unique
   performance metric Id.  Regarding naming convention, the Performance
   Metric Names SHOULD be meaningfull and easily searchable in the
   registry.

   The group of experts (the reviewers) MUST check the requested
   Peformance Metric for completeness, accuracy of the template
   description, and for correct naming according to [RFC6390].

   Requests for Performance Metric that duplicate the functionality of
   existing Performance Metris SHOULD be declined.

4.  Initial Set of Performance Metrics

4.1.  Existing Performetrics Metrics, Based on the RFC6390 Template

   This section contains a list of Performance Metrics specified
   according to [RFC6390], either in RFCs, or IETF drafts currently in
   the RFC editor queue.  This list should serve as initial content for
   the Performance Metrics Registry.

    Table 1: List of Existing Performance Metrics Specified at the IETF

4.2.  Mapping Some IPPM Performance Metrics in the Registry

   The IPPM WG [IPPM] specified some Measurement Parameters (or
   measurement characteristics), for example Type-P [RFC2330], packet
   distribution, etc.

   The IPPM WG also specified Performance Metrics.  For example:

      A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM [RFC2679]

      A One-way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM [RFC2680]

      A Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM [RFC2681]

   Those Performance Metrics are based on specific values for the
   Measurement Parameters.  For example: the mean packet loss at IP
   layer, based on a periodic packet distribution, represented with
   percentile 95th.

   The Performance Metrics Registry should contain the IPPM-specified
   Performance Metrics that are operationally relevant, as oppposed to
   all Performance Metrics, resulting of all the potential combination
   of Measurement Parameters.

   In a typical Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP)
   environment, some information can complement the test to be run:

      Measurement Parameters configured part of the test definition

      run-time parameters observed during the test

   If a test definition requests the round-trip delay metric to a DNS
   server to be metered "now", the DNS server is a Measurement Parameter
   configured part of the test definition.  Some run-time parameters
   observed during the test complement the test report: the IP address
   of the DNS server, the measurement start time, the measurement end
   time, the DSCP, the TTL, etc.

Internet-Draft            PERF-METRIC REGISTRY              October 2013


   Those run-time parameters are not part of the Performance Metric
   definition, while the specific values for the Measurement Parameters
   are part of it.

4.2.1.  IPPM Performance Metric Mapping Experiment

   This section is an illustration on how the IP Packet Delay Variation
   (IPDV) Performance Metric [RFC3393] maps to the RFC 6390 template.
   Note that the delay variation is sometimes called "jitter", as
   mentioned in the section 1.1 of [RFC3393], and in section 1 of
   [RFC5481].

      Normative Reference



         Performance Metric Element ID



            TBD1: The next available Performance Metric Element ID in
            the Performance Metric Registry.

         Metric Name



            Packet Delay Variation for UDP Packet with Periodic
            Distribution reported as 95th percentile

         Metric Description



            The difference between the one-way-delay of the selected
            packets, reported as the positive 95th percentile.

            The default measurement parameters are

            o L, a packet length in bits, in case of active probing.  L

            o etc.  (I have not reviewed all the parameters of [RFC3393]

            If any of those measurement parameters is not the default
            value, its value must be stored with the performance metric
            value, as context information.  THIS IS UP TO DISCUSSION.

         Method of Measurement or Calculation



            As documented in Section 4.1 of [RFC5481]: If we have
            packets in a stream consecutively numbered i = 1,2,3,...
            falling within the test interval, then IPDV(i) = D(i)-D(i-1)
            where D(i) denotes the one-way delay of the ith packet of a
            stream.

            One-way delays are the difference between timestamps applied
            at the ends of the path, or the receiver time minus the
            transmission time.

            So D(2) = R2-T2.  With this timestamp notation, it can be
            shown that IPDV also represents the change in inter-packet
            spacing between transmission and reception:

            IPDV(2) = D(2) - D(1) = (R2-T2) - (R1-T1) = (R2-R1) -
            (T2-T1)

         Units of Measurement



            As documented in Section 8.3 of [RFC5481]: With IPDV, it is
            interesting to report on a positive percentile, and an
            inter-quantile range is appropriate to reflect both positive
            and negative tails (e.g., 5% to 95%).  If the IPDV
            distribution is symmetric around a mean of zero, then it is
            sufficient to report on the positive side of the
            distribution.

            The unit of measurement is percentile 95th.

         Measurement Point(s) with potential Measurement Domain



            As documented in Section 4.1 of [RFC5481]: Both IPDV and PDV
            are derived from the one-way-delay metric.  One-way delay
            requires knowledge of time at two points, e.g., the source



Claise & Akhter          Expires April 07, 2014                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft            PERF-METRIC REGISTRY              October 2013


            and destination of an IP network path in end-to-end
            measurement.  Therefore, both IPDV and PDV can be
            categorized as 2-point metrics because they are derived from
            one-way delay.  Specific methods of measurement may make
            assumptions or have a priori knowledge about one of the
            measurement points, but the metric definitions themselves
            are based on information collected at two measurement
            points.

         Measurement Timing



            As documented in Section 4.1 of [RFC5481]: The mean of all
            IPDV(i) for a stream is usually zero.  However, a slow delay
            change over the life of the stream, or a frequency error
            between the measurement system clocks, can result in a non-
            zero mean.

            See also http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5481#section-6.3 for
            "clock stability and error" considerations.

            See also http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5481#section-8.5 for
            "clock Sync Options" considerations.

      Informative Reference



         Implementation



            As documented in Section 4.1 of [RFC5481]: Note that IPDV
            can take on positive and negative values (and zero).  One
            way to analyze the IPDV results is to concentrate on the
            positive excursions.  However, this approach has limitations
            that are discussed in more detail below (see Section 5.3 of
            [RFC5481]).

            See section 7 " Applicability of the Delay Variation Forms
            and Recommendations" of [RFC5481]:

         Reporting Model



            As mentioned previously: If any of those measurement
            parameters is not the default, its value must be stored with
            the performance metric value, as context information.

4.2.2.  Which IPPM Performance Metrics?

   Not all possible combinations of Measurement Parameters for all IPPM
   Performance Metrics will populate the Performance Metrics Registry.
   The criteria for selecting the Performance Metrics are (based on
   discussion with Brian Trammell):

      (1) interpretable by the user

      (2) implementable by the software designer

      (3) deployable by network operators, without major impact on the
      networks

      (4) accurate, for interoperability and deployment across vendors

   Which IPPM Performance Metrics will be selected for the Performance
   Registry is out of the scope of this document, for now.  What is
   envisioned is a RFC similar to "Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer
   Edge Routers", [RFC6204], but for Performance Metrics: "Basic
   Performance Metrics Requirements for IP Packet SLA Monitoring with
   Active Probing", or something similar.  This document would explain
   the list of Performance Metrics (from the Performance Metrics
   Registry, so with fixed Measurement Parameters), along with some
   proposed run time parameters, depending on the deployment scenario.

5.  Performance Metrics in the IPFIX Registry

   There are multiple proposals to add performance metrics Information
   Elements in the IPFIX IANA registry [iana-ipfix-assignments], to be
   used with the IPFIX protocol [RFC7011].  This is perfectly legal
   according the "Information Model for IPFIX" [RFC7012] and "Guidelines
   for Authors and Reviewers of IPFIX Information Elements" [RFC7013].

   Simply adding some text in the Information Element Description field
   might be a solution if this description is compliant with the RFC6390
   template definition.  However, this is not an ideal solution.  On the



Claise & Akhter          Expires April 07, 2014                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft            PERF-METRIC REGISTRY              October 2013


   top of having potentially long descriptions, this imposes a specific
   formatting for the description field of the performance metrics-
   related Information Elements, while none is imposed for the non
   performance metrics-related ones.

   The preferred approach is for the Performance Metrics to be self-
   described in their own registry.  When the Performance Metrics needs
   to be defined in the IPFIX IANA registry, the new Information Element
   can simply refer to the specific entry in the Performance Metrics
   registry.

6.  Security Considerations

   This draft doesn't introduce any security considerations.  However,
   the definition of Performance Metrics may introduce some security
   concerns, and should be reviewed with security in mind.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document refers to an initial set of Performance Metrics.  The
   list of these Information Elements is given in the "Initial Set of
   Performance Metrics" Section.  The Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) has created a new registry for Performance Metrics
   called "Performance Metrics", and filled it with the initial list in
   Section 4.

   New assignments for Peformance Metric will be administered by IANA
   through Expert Review [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of
   experts appointed by the IESG upon recommendation of the Ops Area
   Directors.  The experts will initially be drawn from the Working
   Group Chairs and document editors of the Performance Metrics
   directorate [performance-metrics-directorate].
