		  MIF hosts normally have multiple provisioning domains or interfaces. In some
		  cases, the applications running on the MIF hosts need to select provisioning 
		  domain or interface based on either user preferences or network polices.
		  There is currently no standard ways for the MIF hosts to implement this kind
		  of provisioning domain/interface selection. This document discusses the

<!-- Introduction -->

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>
	The applications running on the MIF hosts normally do not have the
	knowledge of the multiple provisioning domain or multiple interfaces
  information. But sometimes, the network connection of the applications 
  running on the MIF hosts need to be controlled to switch from one
  network to another based on either operator polices or user preference.
  For example, ANDSF (Access Network Discovery and Selection Function)
  that defined by 3GPP <xref target="TS.24.312"/> can push network selection policies to the
  terminal. However, there is no standard and well defined interfaces
  for this kind of policy based flow control enforcement. This will
  lead to the complexity and difficulties of the policy enforcement
  implementation. This document discusses the problem statement
  of flow control of MIF host.

<!-- 3 Scenario of flow control of MIF hosts -->

<section title="Scenario and problem statement of flow control of the MIF hosts">
	<t>
		This section discusses the scenario of the flow control of MIF host. Then analysis
		the problems in this scenario.
	</t>

	<section title="Scenario of flow control of MIF hosts">
		<t>
			One example of the MIF hosts flow control policy enforement is ANDSF based
			policy provisioning. As figure 1 illustrated, the MIF host have both
			WLAN and celluar network connection. ANDSF can push network selection policy to the
			MIF host. There are three types of policies:
			1. Network discovery information. For example, the location of WLAN network
			information or other access network information.
			2. Inter-system mobility policy (ISMP). Those policies for the terminals with
			no more than one active access network connection.
			3. Inter-system routing policy (ISRP). Those policies for the terminals
			that can have multiple network connections simultaneously.
		</t>
		
		<t>
			For the ISMP policies, the MIF host can rely on the connection manager
			to enforce the network selection policy. For example, if the policy
			for the MIF host is to select WLAN network, the connection manager
			can control the terminal to switch on the WLAN interface and disconnect
			the celluar data connection.
		</t>
		
		<t>
			There are flow based policies defined by 3GPP ANDSF specification <xref target="TS.24.312"/>. 
			An IP flow  can be identified by source/destination IP address and port number. For
			ISRP flow based policies, if the terminal and network support IFOM/MAPCON,
			the enforcement of flow based policy could be implemented by the 
			mechanism provided by IFOM/MAPCON. But for the non-seamless ISRP flow based
			policies, there is no standard and well defined interface for implementation.
			This lead to the difficulties for the operators to deploy the ANDSF
			flow based policies.
		</t>

			Another use case for flow based policy control is the user preference. 
			The users may want to set certain rules for a particular
			application's network usage. For example, the user may want to set the
			online video app can only be used over WLAN network and the walled-garden
			application provided by the operator only be used over celluar network.
			Without a standard and well defined interface, it is difficult to
			implement those policies.
		</t>

	<section title="Problem analysis of flow based policies for MIF hosts">
		<t>
			As discussed in the above scenario, due to the lack of standard and
			well defined interface, it is difficult and with high complexity
			to implement the IP flow based policies. There are different ways
			to cope with problem. For example, similar to the idea of
			open flow, to define an extended forwarding table in the MIF host 
			and allows the MIF host read forwarding policies from configuration.
