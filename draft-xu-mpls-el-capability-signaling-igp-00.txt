  Signaling Entropy Label Capability Using Interior Gateway Protocols
              draft-xu-mpls-el-capability-signaling-igp-00

Abstract

   Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a mechanism to load
   balance traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).  An LSR inserts the
   EL Indicator and the EL label only if the LSR that pops them has the
   capability of processing them.  This draft defines a mechanism to
   signal that capability using link state Interior Gateway Protocols
   (IGP).  This mechanism is useful when the label advertisement is also
   done via that IGP.

1.  Introduction

   Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a method in
   [RFC6790] to load balance traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).
   An LSR inserts the EL Indicator and the EL only if the LSR that pops
   those labels has the capability of recognizing and processing them.
   [RFC6790] defines the signaling of this capability (a.k.a Entropy
   Label Capability - ELC) via signaling protocols.  Recently,
   mechanisms are being defined to signal labels via link state Interior
   Gateway Protocols (IGP) such as OSPF
   [I-D.psenak-ospf-segment-routing-extensions] and ISIS
   [I-D.previdi-isis-segment-routing-extensions].  In such scenarios the
   signaling mechanisms defined in [RFC6790] are inadequate.  This draft
   defines mechanisms to signal the ELC using the link state
   advertisements (LSA) of the IGPs OSPF and ISIS.  These capabilities
   are advertised for the entire router and not just a single prefix.
   This mechanism is useful when the label advertisement is also done
   via that IGP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Abbreviations and Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC6790], [RFC4970] and
   [RFC4971].

3.  Advertising ELC using OSPF

   The OSPF Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA defined in [RFC4970] is
   used by OSPF routers to announce their capabilities.  A new TLV
   within the body of this LSA, called ELC TLV is defined to advertise
   the capability of the router to process the ELI and EL.  Its
   formatting follows that described in sec 2.1 of [RFC4970].  This TLV
   is applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  The Type for the ELC TLV
   needs to be assigned by IANA and it has a Length of zero.  The scope
   of the advertisement depends on the application but it is recommended
   that it SHOULD be AS-scoped.

4.  Advertising ELC using ISIS

   The IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV defined in [RFC4971] is used by IS-IS
   routers to announce their capabilities.  A new sub-TLV of this TLV,
   called ELC sub-TLV is defined to advertise the capability of the
   router to process the ELI and EL.  It is formatted as described in
   [RFC5305] with a Type code to be assigned by IANA and a Length of
   zero.  The scope of the advertisement depends on the application but
   it is recommended that it SHOULD be domain-wide.

5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank TBD for their comments.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes requests to IANA to allocate a TLV type from the
   OSPF RI TLVs registry and a sub-TLV type within the IS-IS Router
   Capability TLV.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations.
