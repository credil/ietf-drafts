    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2131"></xref> and
      DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> options which can be used to
      provision PCP Server <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref> names.
      Motivations for defining PCP option as a name and not an IP address are
      discussed in <xref target="rationale"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In order to make use of these options, this document assumes
      appropriate name resolution means (e.g., Section 6.1.1 of <xref
      target="RFC1123"></xref>) are available on the host client.</t>

      <t>The use of DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 depends on the PCP deployment
      scenarios.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This document makes use of the following terms:<?rfc subcompact="yes" ?></t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>PCP Server denotes a functional element which receives and
          processes PCP requests from a PCP Client. A PCP Server can be
          co-located with or be separated from the function (e.g., NAT,
          Firewall) it controls. Refer to <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref>.</t>

          <t>PCP Client denotes a PCP software instance responsible for
          issuing PCP requests to a PCP Server. Refer to <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref>.</t>

          <t>DHCPv4 refers to the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol <xref
          target="RFC2131"></xref> for IPv4.</t>

          <t>DHCP refers to both DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2131"></xref> and
          DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>.</t>

          <t>DHCP client (or client) denotes a node that initiates requests to
          obtain configuration parameters from one or more DHCP servers.</t>

          <t>DHCP server (or server) refers to a node that responds to
          requests from DHCP clients.</t>

          <t>Name is a domain name that contains one or more labels. In
          particular, a PCP name may be structured as DNS qualified name or be
          composed of strings such as can be passed to getaddrinfo (Section
          6.1 of <xref target="RFC3493"></xref>), including address literals,

    <section anchor="rationale" title="Rationale">
      <t>Both IP Address and Name DHCP options have been considered in early
      stages of this specification. This flexibility aims to let service
      providers to make their own engineering choices and use the convenient
      option according to their deployment context. Nevertheless, DHC WG's
      position is this flexibility has some drawbacks such as inducing errors
      (See Section 7 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines"></xref>). Therefore, only the
      Name option is maintained within this document.</t>

      <t>This document defines an option to carry a name rather than an IP
      address. This choice is motivated by operational considerations: In
      particular, some Service Providers are considering two levels of
      redirection:</t>

      <t><?rfc subcompact="yes" ?><list style="format (%d)">
          <t>The first level is national-wise and undertaken by DHCP: a
          regional-specific Name will be returned;</t>

          <t>The second level is done during the resolution of the
          regional-specific Name to redirect the customer to a regional PCP
          server among a pool deployed regionally.</t>
        </list><?rfc subcompact="no" ?></t>

      <t></t>

      <t>Distinct operational teams are responsible for each of the above
      mentioned levels. A clear separation between the functional perimeter of
      each team is a sensitive task for the maintenance of the offered
      services. Regional teams will require to introduce new resources (e.g.,
      new PCP-controlled devices such as Carrier Grade NATs (CGNs, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements"></xref>)) to meet an increase
      of customer base. Operations related to the introduction of these new
      devices (e.g., addressing, redirection, etc.) are implemented locally.
      Having this regional separation provides flexibility to manage portions
      of network operated by dedicated teams. This two-level redirection can
      not be met by the IP Address option.</t>

      <t>In addition to the operational considerations:<?rfc subcompact="yes" ?><list
          style="symbols">
          <t>The use of the Name for NAT64 <xref target="RFC6146"></xref>
          might be suitable for load-balancing purposes;</t>

          <t>For the DS-Lite case <xref target="RFC6333"></xref>, if the
          encapsulation mode is used to send PCP messages, an IP address may
          be used since the AFTR selection is already done via the AFTR_NAME
          DHCPv6 option <xref target="RFC6334"></xref>. Of course, this
          assumes that the PCP Server is co-located with the AFTR function. If
          these functions are not co-located, conveying the Name would be more
          convenient.</t>
