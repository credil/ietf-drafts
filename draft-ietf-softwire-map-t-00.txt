Internet-Draft                    MAP-T                     October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Experiences from initial IPv6 deployments indicate that transitioning
   a network providers' domain fully to IPv6 requires not only the
   continued support of legacy IPv4 users connected to the boundary of
   that domain, allowing IPv4 address sharing, but also the need for
   carrying out IPv6-only operational practices in that domain [, also
   for traffic from IPv4 users.  The use of an double NAT64 translation
   based solutions is an optimal way to address these requirements,
   particularly in combination with stateless translation techniques
   that seek to minimize challenges outlined in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation].

   The Mapping of Address and Port - Translation (MAP-T) solution
   defined in this document is such a solution, that builds on existing
   stateless NAT64 techniques specified in [RFC6145], along with a
   stateless algorithmic address & port mapping scheme to allow the
   sharing of IPv4 addresses across an IPv6 network.  The MAP-T solution
   is closely related to MAP-E [I-D.ietf-softwire-map], with both
   utilizing the same algorithmic method, but differing in their choice
   of translation [RFC6145] and encapsulation [RFC2473]based IPv6
   transports.

   A companion draft defines the DHCPv6 options for provisioning of MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-map-dhcp-option], applicable to both MAP-T and
   MAP-E.

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   MAP domain:             One or more MAP CEs and BRs connected to the
                           same IPv6 network.  A service provider may
                           deploy a single MAP domain, or may utilize
                           multiple MAP domains.

   MAP Rule:               A set of parameters describing the mapping
                           between an IPv4 prefix, IPv4 address or
                           shared IPv4 address and an IPv6 prefix or
                           address.  Each MAP domain uses a different
                           mapping rule set.

   MAP node:               A device that implements MAP.

   MAP Border Relay (BR):  A MAP enabled router managed by the service
                           provider at the edge of a MAP domain.  A
                           Border Relay router has at least an IPv6-
                           enabled interface and an IPv4 interface
                           connected to the native IPv4 network.  A MAP
                           BR may also be referred to simply as a "BR"
                           within the context of MAP.

   MAP Customer Edge (CE): A device functioning as a Customer Edge
                           router in a MAP deployment.  A typical MAP CE
                           adopting MAP rules will serve a residential
                           site with one WAN side interface, and one or
                           more LAN side interfaces.  A MAP CE may also
                           be referred to simply as a "CE" within the
                           context of MAP.

   Port-set:               Each node has a separate part of the
                           transport layer port space; denoted as a
                           port-set.

   Port-set ID (PSID):     Algorithmically identifies a set of ports
                           exclusively assigned to the CE.

   Shared IPv4 address:    An IPv4 address that is shared among multiple
                           CEs.  Only ports that belong to the assigned
                           port-set can be used for communication.  Also
                           known as a Port-Restricted IPv4 address.

   End-user IPv6 prefix:   The IPv6 prefix assigned to an End-user CE by
                           other means than MAP itself.  E.g.
                           Provisioned using DHCPv6 PD [RFC3633] or
                           configured manually.  It is unique for each
                           CE.

   MAP IPv6 address:       The IPv6 address used to reach the MAP
                           function of a CE from other CEs and from BRs.

   Rule IPv6 prefix:       An IPv6 prefix assigned by a Service Provider
                           for a mapping rule.

   Rule IPv4 prefix:       An IPv4 prefix assigned by a Service Provider
                           for a mapping rule.

   Embedded Address (EA) bits:  The IPv4 EA-bits in the IPv6 address
                           identify an IPv4 prefix/address (or part
                           thereof) or a shared IPv4 address (or part
                           thereof) and a port-set identifier.

   MRT:                    MAP Rule table.  Address and Port aware data
                           structure, supporting longest match lookups.
                           The MRT is used by the MAP forwarding
                           function.

   The MAP-T BR is responsible for connecting external IPv4 networks to
   all devices in one or more MAP-T domains, using stateless NAT64 as
   extended by the MAP-T rules in this document.

   Besides the CE and BR, the MAP-T domain can contain any regular IPv6-
   only hosts/servers that have an IPv4 mapped IPv6 address (IPv4-
   translatable address per [RFC6052]) using a prefix assigned to the
   MAP-T domain.  Communication with such devices is naturally possible
   in the MAP-T architecture from inside or outside the MAP-T domain
   including from any IPv4-only hosts.  In this mode, any IPv6-only
   servers SHOULD have both A and AAAA DNS server records.  DNS64
   [RFC6147] becomes required only when IPv6 servers in the MAP-T domain
   are expected themselves to initiate communication to internal/
   external IPv4-only entities.

   Functionally the MAP-T CE and BR use existing standard functional
   building blocks, or extensions to these as follows:

   o  A standard NAPT [RFC2663] function on a MAP CE is extended with
      support for restricting the allowable TCP/UDP ports for a given
      IPv4 address.  The enforcement of NAPT function, as well as the
      port restriction is conditional upon the MAP CE's configuration as
      applied by the network operator.

   o  A standard stateless NAT64 function [RFC6145]is extended for
      translating IPv4 traffic to IPv6, based on a lookup of source/
      destination IPv4 address + TCP/UDP port or ICMP id information
      that is then mapped to the source/destination IPv6 address.  This
      algorithmic mapping is specified in section 5.

   Section 6 describes how these functional blocks are combined with the
   Mapping Rules of Section 4 to enable IPv4-IPv6 communication between
   the CE and BR and IPv6-only servers in the domain.


5.  Mapping Rules

   A MAP node is provisioned with one or more mapping rules.

   Mapping rules are used differently depending on their function.
   Every MAP node must be provisioned with a Basic mapping rule.  This
   is used by the node to configure its IPv4 address, IPv4 prefix or
   shared IPv4 address.  This same basic rule can also be used for
   forwarding, where an IPv4 destination address and optionally a
   destination port is mapped into an IPv6 address or prefix.
   Additional mapping rules are specified to allow for e.g.  Multiple
   different IPv4 subnets to exist within the domain and optimize
   forwarding between them.

   Traffic outside of the domain (i.e.  When the destination IPv4
   address does not match (using longest matching prefix) any Rule IPv4
   prefix in the Rules database) will be forward using the Default
   mapping rule.  The Default mapping rule maps outside destinations to
   the BR's IPv6 address or prefix.

   In summary, there are three types of mapping rules:

   1.  Basic Mapping Rule (BMR) - used for configuring the CE's IPv4
       address and/or port set assignment as well as deriving the MAP
       IPv6 address that the CE is to use.  There can only be one Basic
       Mapping Rule per End-user IPv6 prefix.  The BMR is composed of
       the following parameters:

       *  Rule IPv6 prefix (including prefix length)

       *  Rule IPv4 prefix (including prefix length)

       *  Rule EA-bits length (in bits)

       *  Rule Port Parameters (optional)

   2.  Forwarding Mapping Rule - used for forwarding in the MAP domain.
       The Basic Mapping Rule is also a Forwarding Mapping Rule.  Each
       Forwarding Mapping Rule will result in an entry in the MRT for
       the Rule IPv4 prefix + any port range.  The FMR consists of the
       following parameters:

       *  Rule IPv6 prefix (including prefix length)

       *  Rule IPv4 prefix (including prefix length)

       *  Rule EA-bits length (in bits)

       *  Rule Port Parameters (optional)

   3.  Default Mapping Rule - used for destinations outside the MAP
       domain.  An IPv4 0.0.0.0/0 entry is installed in the MRT for this
       rule.

       *  IPv6 prefix of the BR

       *  Rule BR IPv4 address (Optional - can be used for testing a
          BR's reachability)

   A MAP node finds its Basic Mapping Rule by doing a longest match
   between the End-user IPv6 prefix and the Rule IPv6 prefix in the
   Mapping Rule database.  The rule is then used for IPv4 prefix,

   address or shared address assignment.

   A MAP IPv6 address is formed from the BMR Rule IPv6 prefix.  This
   address MUST be recognized by the MAP node, typically a CE, and used
   to terminate all MAP traffic received by the node.

   Port-aware IPv4 entries in the MRT are installed for all the
   Forwarding Mapping Rules and an IPv4 default route for the Default
   Mapping Rule.

   In hub and spoke mode, all traffic MUST be forwarded using the
   Default Mapping Rule.

5.1.  Basic mapping rule (BMR)

   The BMR is used in combination with the CE's IPv6 prefix to derive
   the MAP IPv4 address, port-set and also the MAP IPv6 address.  The
   structure of a MAP CE's IPv6 address is shown below, along with the
   Interface-identifer that is defined in Section 5.4.

   The Rule IPv6 prefix is the part of the End-user IPv6 prefix (i.e.
   the regular IPv6 prefix or address that is assigned to any IPv6
   device) that is common among all CEs within the MAP domain.  The
   Embedded Address bits (EA bits) are the unique per end user within
   that Rule IPv6 prefix (some readers may want to think of these as
   "MAP customer identifier" bits for a given MAP domain covered by the
   Rule IPv6 prefix).  When present, the EA bits encode the CE specific
   full or part of an IPv4 prefix or address, and in the shared IPv4
   address case contain a Port-Set Identifier (PSID) that ultimately
   determines the allowed port-range for the CE.  An EA-bit length of 0

   signifies that all relevant MAP IPv4 addressing information is passed
   directly in the BMR rule

   The MAP subnet ID is defined to be the first subnet (all bits set to
   zero) of length s required to make n+o+s=64.  A MAP CE node MUST
   reserve the first IPv6 prefix in a End-user IPv6 prefix for the
   purpose of MAP.

   CE's MAP IPv6 address is created by concatenating the End-user IPv6
   prefix with the all zeros MAP subnet-id and the interface-id as
   specified in Section 5.4.

   The CE's IPv4 address is synthesized from the CE's IPv6 address and
   the parameters obtained in the BMR, namely by extracting the IPv4
   suffix from the EA-bits, if any, and combining it with the Rule's
   IPv4 prefix.  Figures below show the synthesis for cases of a Shared
   IPv4 address, and a non-shared, complete, IPv4 address:

                           Shared IPv4 address:

                           Figure 5: IPv4 prefix

   The length of r MAY be zero, in which case the complete IPv4 address
   or prefix is encoded in the EA bits.  If only a part of the IPv4
   address/prefix is encoded in the EA bits, the Rule IPv4 prefix is
   provisioned to the CE by other means (e.g. a DHCPv6 option).  To
   create a complete IPv4 address (or prefix), the IPv4 address suffix
   (p) from the EA bits, are concatenated with the Rule IPv4 prefix (r
   bits).

   The offset of the EA bits field in the IPv6 address is equal to the
   BMR Rule IPv6 prefix length.  The length of the EA bits field (o) is
   given by the BMR Rule EA-bits length.  The sum of the Rule IPv6
   Prefix length and the Rule EA-bits length MUST be less or equal than
   the End-user IPv6 prefix length.

   If o + r < 32 (length of the IPv4 address in bits), then an IPv4
   prefix is assigned.

   If o + r is equal to 32, then a full IPv4 address is to be assigned.
   The address is created by concatenating the Rule IPv4 prefix and the
   EA-bits.

   If o + r is > 32, then a shared IPv4 address is to be assigned.  The
   number of IPv4 address suffix bits (p) in the EA bits is given by 32
   - r bits.  The PSID bits are used to create a port-set.  The length
   of the PSID bit field within EA bits is: o - p.

   The length of r MAY be 32, with no part of the IPv4 address embedded
   in the EA bits.  This results in a mapping with no dependence between
   the IPv4 address and the IPv6 address.  In addition the length of o
   MAY be zero (no EA bits embedded in the End-User IPv6 prefix),
   meaning that also the PSID is provisioned using e.g.  The DHCP
   option.

   In the following examples, only the suffix (last 8 bits) of the IPv4
   address is embedded in the EA bits (r = 24), while the IPv4 prefix
   (first 24 bits) is given in the BMR Rule IPv4 prefix.

   all IPv4 destinations outside of the MAP IPv4 domain.  For MAP-T, the
   DMR is specified in terms of the BR IPv6 prefix.  The Rule IPv4
   prefix in the MRT is: 0.0.0.0/0, i.e. the default IPv4 route.

   There MUST be only one Default Mapping Rule within a MAP domain.

                       Example: Default Mapping Rule

   The Deafult Rule's IPv6 prefix is combined by a MAP-T CE with the
   IPv4 destination addresses, using RFC6052, to form a full IPv6
   destination address for any IPv4 destination following the IPv4
   default route.  Figure 7 below shows such an address format.  Note
   that the BR prefix-length is variable and can be both shorter or
   longer than 64 bits, up to 96 bits.  In the respective cases the IPv4
   address and the BR prefix are shifted and "bit spread" across the
   fixed u-octet boundary as per [RFC6052].  All trailing bits after the
   IPv4 address are set to 0x0.

5.4.  MAP IPv6 Interface Identifier

   The IPv6 Interface identifier format of a MAP node is based on the
   format specified in section 2.2 of [RFC6052], with the added PSID
   field if present, as shown in Figure 8.

   The encoding of the full IPv4 address into the interface identifier
   into the IPv6 addresses have been shown to be useful for
   troubleshooting.

   In the case of an IPv4 prefix, the IPv4 address field is right-padded
   with zeros up to 32 bits.  The PSID field is left-padded to create a
   16 bit field.  For an IPv4 prefix or a complete IPv4 address, the

   PSID field is zero.

5.5.  Port mapping algorithm

   The Generalized Modulus Algorithm (GMA) is used in MAP domains whose
   rules allow IPv4 address sharing.  Each CE in such a domain has an
   IPv4 address and a unique Port-Set Identifier (PSID), that is derived
   by means of the BMR.  For a given IPv4 address, the algorithm allows
   each PSID to be processed to reveal a set of unique non-overlapping
   ports, or alternatively for any given port to derive the PSID it
   corresponds to.  Two extreme cases supported by algorithm are: (1)
   the port numbers are not contiguous for each PSID, but uniformly
   distributed across the port range (0-65535); (2) the port numbers are
   contiguous in a single range for each PSID.

   For a given sharing ratio (R) and the maximum number of contiguous
   ports (M), the GMA algorithm is defined as:

   1.  The port (P) of a given PSID (K) is composed of:

   P = R * M * j + M * K + i

       Where:

       *  PSID: K = 0 to R - 1

       *  Port range index: j = (4096 / M) / R to ((65536 / M) / R) - 1,
          if the port numbers (0 - 4095) are excluded.

       *  Contiguous Port index: i = 0 to M - 1

   2.  The PSID (K) of a given port number (P) is determined by:

   K = (floor(P/M)) % R

       Where:

       *  % is the modulus operator

       *  floor(arg) is a function that returns the largest integer not
          greater than arg.

5.5.1.  Bit Representation of the Algorithm

   Given a sharing ratio (R=2^k), the maximum number of contiguous ports
   (M=2^m), for any PSID (K) and available ports (P) can be represented
   as:

                       Figure 9: Bit representation

   Where j and i are the same indexes defined in the port mapping
   algorithm.

   For any port number, the PSID can be obtained by a bit mask
   operation.

   For a > 0, j MUST be larger than 0.  This ensures that the algorithm
   excludes the system ports ([I-D.ietf-tsvwg-iana-ports]).  For a = 0,
   j MAY be 0 to allow for the provisioning of the system ports.

   For example, for R = 1024, PSID offset: a = 4 and PSID length: k = 10
   bits

             Port-set-1                Port-set-2

   PSID=1   | 4100, 4101, 4102, 4103, | 8196,  8197,  8198,  8199, | ...

                    Example 1: with offset = 4 (a = 4)

   For example, for R = 64, a = 0 (PSID offset = 0 and PSID length = 6
   bits):

5.5.3.  GMA Excluded Ports

   By default the GMA ensures that a number of "well known" ports are
   excluded from use by the algorithm.  This number is determined by the
   number of offset bits (a), in the figure above.  This value can be
   optionally provisioned via the "Rule Port Mapping Parameters" in the
   Basic Mapping Rule.  In the absence of such provisioning, the
   defaults are:

   o  Excluded ports : 0-4095

   o  Offset bits (a) : 4

   For (a) offset bits, the range of excluded ports is 0 to 2 ^ (16-a) -
   1.


6.  Packet Forwarding

   The mapping rules and architectual building blocks are combined at
   the CE and BR to enable IPv4-IPv6 communication as follows.

6.1.  IPv4 to IPv6 at the CE

   A MAP-T CE receiving IPv4 packets SHOULD perform NAT44 function first
   and create appropriate NAT44 stateful bindings.  The resulting IPv4
   packets MUST contain the source IPv4 address and source transport
   port number assigned to the CE by means of the MAP Basic Mapping Rule
   (BMR).

   The IPv4 traffic is subject to a longest IPv4 address + port match
   MAP rule selection using the MRT, which then determines the
   subsequent NAT64 operation.  By default, all traffic is matched to
   default mapping rule (DMR), and subject to the stateless NAT64
   operation using the DMR parameters for the MAP algorithm and NAT64.

   An optional mapping rule, known as a forward mapping rule (FMR), can
   be used when forwarding to destinations that correspond to a specific
   IPv4+port range in the MAP-T domain i.e.  Typically the IPv4 address
   and port range of another MAP-T CE, aka mesh-mode.  Traffic that is
   matched to such a rule is subject to the stateless NAT64 operation
   using the FMR parameters for the MAP algorithm and stateless NAT64.

   A MAP-T CE MUST support a default mapping rule and SHOULD support one
   or more forward mapping rules.

6.2.  IPv6 to IPv4 at the CE

   A MAP-T CE receiving an IPv6 packet performs its regular IPv6
   operations, whereby only packets that are addressed to the MAP-T BMR
   addresses are forwarded to the CE's stateless NAT64 function.  All
   other IPv6 traffic SHOULD be forwarded as per the CE's IPv6 routing
   rules.  The CE SHOULD check that MAP-T received packets' transport-
   layer destination port number is in the range configured by MAP for
   the CE and the CE SHOULD drop any non conforming packet and respond
   with an ICMPv6 "Address Unreachable" (Type 1, Code 3).

   The CE's stateless NAT64 function MUST derive the IPv4 source and
   destination addresses as per Section 5 of this document and MUST
   replace the IPv6 header with an IPv4 header in accordance with
   [RFC6145].  The resulting IPv4 packet is then forwarded to the CE's
   NAPT function, when this is enabled, where the destination IPv4
   address and port number MUST be mapped to their original value,
   before being forwarded according to the CE's regular IPv4 rules.
   When the NAPT function is not enabled, the traffic from the stateless
   NAT64 function is directly forwarded according to the CE's IPv4
   rules.

6.3.  IPv6 to IPv4 at the BR

   A MAP-T BR receiving IPv6 packets MUST select a best matching MAP
   rule based on a longest address match of the packets' source address
   against the BR's configured MAP BMR prefix(es), as well as a match of
   the packet destination address against the configured FMR prefix(es).
   The selected MAP rule allows the BR to determine the CE's range from
   the port-set-id contained in the source IPv6 address.  The BR MUST
   perform a validation of the consistency of the source against the
   allowed values from the identified port-range port.  If the packets
   source port number is found to be outside the range allowed for this
   CE-index and the BMR, the BR MUST drop the packet and respond with an
   ICMPv6 "Destination Unreachable, Source address failed ingress/egress
   policy" (Type 1, Code 5).

   The BR MUST derive the source and destination IPv4 addresses as per
   Section 5 of this document and translate the IPv6 to IPv4 headers
   following [RFC6145].  The resulting IPv4 packets are then passed to
   regular IPv4 forwarding by the BR.

6.4.  IPv4 to IPv6 at the BR

   A MAP-T BR receiving IPv4 packets uses a longest match IPv4 + port
   lookup to select the target MAP-T domain and rule.  The BR MUST then
   derive the IPv6 source and destination addresses from the IPv4 source
   and destination address and port as per Section 5 of this document.

Internet-Draft                    MAP-T                     October 2012


   Following this, the BR MUST translate the IPv4 to IPv6 headers
   following [RFC6145].  The resulting IPv6 packets are then passed to
   regular IPv6 forwarding.

   Note that the operation of a BR when forwarding to MAP-T domains that
   do not utilize IPv4 address sharing, is the same as stateless IPv4/
   IPv6 translation.


7.  ICMP Handling

   ICMP messages need to be supported in MAP-T domain and also across
   it, taking into consideration also the NAPT component and best
   current practice documented in [RFC5508] along with some additional
   specific considerations.

   MAP-T CEs and BRs MUST follow ICMP/ICMPv6 translation as per
   [RFC6145], with the following extension to cover the address sharing/
   port-range feature.

   Unlike TCP and UDP, which each provide two port fields to represent
   both source and destination, the ICMP/ICMPv6 [RFC0792], [RFC4443]
   Query message header has only one ID field which needs to be used to
   identify a sending IPv4 host.

   When receiving IPv4 ICMP messages, the MAP-T CE SHOULD rewrite the ID
   field to a port value derived from the Port-set-id.  A BR MUST
   translate the resulting ICMPv6 packets back to ICMP preserving the ID
   field on its way to an IPv4 destination.

   In the return path, when MAP-T BR receives an ICMP packet containing
   an ID field which is bound for a shared address in the MAP-T domain,
   the MAP-T BR SHOULD use the ID value as a substitute for the
   destination port in determining the IPv6 destination address.  In all
   other cases, the MAP-T BR MUST derive the destination IPv6 address by
   simply mapping the destination IPv4 address without additional port
   info.

   If a MAP BR receives an ICMP error message on its IPv4 interface, the
   MAP BR should translate the ICMP message to an appropriate ICMPv6
   message, as per [RFC6145] and forward it to the intended MAP CE with
   the following considerations.  If IPv4 address is not shared, the MAP
   BR generates a CE IPv6 address from the IPv4 destination address in
   the ICMP error message and encapsulates the ICMP message in IPv6.  If
   the IPv4 address is shared, the MAP BR derives an original IPv4
   packet from the ICMP payload and generates a CE IPv6 address from the
   source address and the source port in the original IPv4 packet.

8.  Fragmentation and Path MTU Discovery

   Due to the different sizes of the IPv4 and IPv6 header, handling the
   maximum packet size is relevant for the operation of any system
   connecting the two address families.  There are three mechanisms to
   handle this issue: Path MTU discovery (PMTUD), fragmentation, and
   transport-layer negotiation such as the TCP Maximum Segment Size
   (MSS) option [RFC0897].  MAP uses all three mechanisms to deal with
   different cases.

8.1.  Fragmentation in the MAP domain

   Translating an IPv4 packet to carry it across the MAP domain will
   increase its size by 20 bytes respectively.  It is strongly
   recommended that the MTU in the MAP domain is well managed and that
   the IPv6 MTU on the CE WAN side interface is set so that no
   fragmentation occurs within the boundary of the MAP domain.

   Fragmentation in MAP-T domain is to be handled as described in
   section 4 and 5 of [RFC6145].

8.2.  Receiving IPv4 Fragments on the MAP domain borders

   Forwarding of an IPv4 packet received from the outside of the MAP
   domain requires the IPv4 destination address and the transport
   protocol destination port.  The transport protocol information is
   only available in the first fragment received.  As described in
   section 5.3.3 of [RFC6346] a MAP node receiving an IPv4 fragmented
   packet from outside has to reassemble the packet before sending the
   packet onto the MAP link.  If the first packet received contains the
   transport protocol information, it is possible to optimize this
   behavior by using a cache and forwarding the fragments unchanged.  A
   description of this algorithm is outside the scope of this document.

8.3.  Sending IPv4 fragments to the outside

   If two IPv4 host behind two different MAP CE's with the same IPv4
   address sends fragments to an IPv4 destination host outside the
   domain.  Those hosts may use the same IPv4 fragmentation identifier,
   resulting in incorrect reassembly of the fragments at the destination
   host.  Given that the IPv4 fragmentation identifier is a 16 bit
   field, it could be used similarly to port ranges.  A MAP CE SHOULD
   rewrite the IPv4 fragmentation identifier to be within its allocated
   port set.

9.  Usage Considerations

9.1.  Hub and spoke with per subscriber rules

   Existing IPv4 service can be realized with MAP using a mapping rule
   per subscriber.  By embedding no part of the IPv4 address in the IPv6
   prefix, no dependency between the two address families is created.
   This may be useful in cases where the IPv6 address allocation is
   sparse, or for other reasons it is difficult to create efficient
   mapping rules.

   The operator has to the choice of provisioning a full IPv4 address to
   the end-user, or a shared IPv4 address by also provisioning the PSID
   in the DHCPv6 option.  A hybrid of this use case is to provision the
   full IPv4 address in the DHCPv6 option, while embedding the PSID in
   the IPv6 prefix.  That will result in one mapping rule per IPv4
   address, e.g.  With a sharing ratio of 64, one rule per 64 customers.

9.2.  Communication with IPv6 servers in the MAP-T domain

   MAP-T allows communication between both IPv4-only and any IPv6
   enabled end hosts, with native IPv6-only servers which are using
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 address based on DMR in the MAP-T domain.  In this
   mode, the IPv6-only servers SHOULD have both A and AAAA records in
   DNS [RFC6219].  DNS64 [RFC6147] become required only when IPv6
   servers in the MAP-T domain are expected themselves to initiate
   communication to external IPv4-only hosts.

9.3.  Backwards compatibility

   A MAP-T CE, in all configuration modes, is by default compatible with
   regular [RFC6146] stateful NAT64 devices that are configured to use/
   advertise BR prefixes.  This allows the use of MAP-T CEs in
   environments that require statistical multiplexing of IPv4 addresses
   while being able to compromise on the stateful nature.  Furthermore,
   a MAP-T CE configured to operate without address sharing (no PSID) is
   compatible with any stateless NAT64 [RFC6146] devices positioned as
   BRs.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not require any IANA actions.


11.  Security Considerations

   Spoofing attacks:  With consistency checks between IPv4 and IPv6
      sources that are performed on IPv4/IPv6 packets received by MAP
      nodes, MAP does not introduce any new opportunity for spoofing
      attacks that would not already exist in IPv6.

   Denial-of-service attacks:  In MAP domains where IPv4 addresses are
      shared, the fact that IPv4 datagram reassembly may be necessary
      introduces an opportunity for DOS attacks.  This is inherent to
      address sharing, and is common with other address sharing
      approaches such as DS-Lite and NAT64/DNS64.  The best protection
      against such attacks is to accelerate IPv6 enablement in both
      clients and servers so that, where MAP is supported, it is less
      and less used.

   Routing-loop attacks:  This attack may exist in some automatic
      tunneling scenarios are documented in [RFC6324].  They cannot
      exist with MAP because each BRs checks that the IPv6 source
      address of a received IPv6 packet is a CE address based on
      Forwarding Mapping Rule.

   Attacks facilitated by restricted port set:  From hosts that are not
      subject to ingress filtering of [RFC2827], some attacks are
      possible by an attacker injecting spoofed packets during ongoing
      transport connections ([RFC4953], [RFC5961], [RFC6056].  The
      attacks depend on guessing which ports are currently used by
      target hosts, and using an unrestricted port set is preferable,
      i.e.  Using native IPv6 connections that are not subject to MAP
      port range restrictions.  To minimize this type of attacks when
      using a restricted port set, the MAP CE's NAT44 filtering behavior
      SHOULD be "Address-Dependent Filtering".  Furthermore, the MAP CEs
      SHOULD use a DNS transport proxy function to handle DNS traffic,
      and source such traffic from IPv6 interfaces not assigned to
      MAP-T.  Practicalities of these methods are discussed in Section
      5.9 of [I-D.dec-stateless-4v6].

   [RFC6269] outlines general issues with IPv4 address sharing.

   Example 1:


      Given the MAP domain information and an IPv6 address of
      an endpoint:

      IPv6 prefix assigned to the end user:  2001:db8:0012:3400::/56
      Basic Mapping Rule:  {2001:db8:0000::/40 (Rule IPv6 prefix),
         192.0.2.0/24 (Rule IPv4 prefix), 16 (Rule EA-bits length)}
      Sharing ratio:  256 (16 - (32 - 24) = 8. 2^8 = 256)
      PSID offset:  4

      A MAP node (CE or BR) can via the BMR determine the IPv4 address
      and port-set as shown below:

      EA bits offset:  40
      IPv4 suffix bits (p)  Length of IPv4 address (32) - IPv4 prefix
         length (24) = 8
      IPv4 address  192.0.2.18 (0xc0000212)
      PSID start:  40 + p = 40 + 8 = 48
      PSID length:  o - p = 16 (56 - 40) - 8 = 8
      PSID:  0x34

      Port-set-1:  4928, 4929, 4930, 4931, 4932, 4933, 4934, 4935, 4936,
         4937, 4938, 4939, 4940, 4941, 4942, 4943
      Port-set-2:  9024, 9025, 9026, 9027, 9028, 9029, 9030, 9031, 9032,
         9033, 9034, 9035, 9036, 9037, 9038, 9039
      ...  ...
      Port-set-15  62272, 62273, 62274, 62275, 62276, 62277, 62278,

      The BMR information allows a MAP CE also to determine (complete)
      its IPv6 address within the indicated IPv6 prefix.

      IPv6 address of MAP-T CE:  2001:db8:0012:3400:00c0:0002:1200:3400

   Example 2:


      Another example can be made of a hypothetical MAP-T BR,
      configured with the following FMR when receiving a packet
      with the following characteristics:

      IPv4 source address:  1.2.3.4 (0x01020304)
      IPv4 source port:  80
      IPv4 destination address:  192.0.2.18 (0xc0000212)
      IPv4 destination port:  9030

      Configured Forwarding Mapping Rule:  {2001:db8:0000::/40
         (Rule IPv6 prefix), 192.0.2.0/24 (Rule IPv4 prefix),
         16 (Rule EA-bits length)}

      MAP-T BR Prefix  2001:db8:ffff::/64

      The above information allows the BR to derive as follows
      the mapped destination IPv6 address for the corresponding
      MAP-T CE, and also the mapped source IPv6 address for
      the IPv4 source.

      IPv4 suffix bits (p)  32 - 24 = 8 (18 (0x12))
      PSID length:  8
      PSID:  0x34 (9030 (0x2346))

      The resulting IPv6 packet will have the following key fields:

      IPv6 source address  2001:db8:ffff:0:0001:0203:0400::
      IPv6 destination address:  2001:db8:0012:3400:00c0:0002:1200:3400
      IPv6 source Port:  80
      IPv6 destination Port:  9030

   Example 3:


      An IPv4 host behind the MAP-T CE (addressed as per the previous
      examples) corresponding with IPv4 host 1.2.3.4 will have its
      packets converted into IPv6 using the DMR configured on the MAP-T
      CE as follows:

      Default Mapping Rule used by MAP-T CE:  {2001:db8:ffff::/64
      (Rule IPv6 prefix), 0.0.0.0/0 (Rule IPv4 prefix), null (BR IPv4
         address)}

      IPv4 source address (post NAT44 if present)  192.0.2.18
      IPv4 destination address:  1.2.3.4
      IPv4 source port (post NAT44 if present):  9030
      IPv4 destination port:  80
      IPv6 source address of MAP-T CE:
                           2001:db8:0012:3400:00c0:0002:1200:3400
      IPv6 destination address:  2001:db8:ffff:0:0001:0203:0400::
