     1. Introduction 

        This document defines a subset of the Management Information 
        Base (MIB) for use in energy management of devices within or 
        connected to communication networks.  The MIB modules in this 
        document are designed to provide a model for energy management, 
        which includes monitoring for power state and energy consumption 
        of networked elements.  This MIB takes into account the Energy 
        Management Framework  [EMAN-FRAMEWORK], which in turn, is based 
        on the Requirements for Energy Management[EMAN-REQ]. 
         
        Energy management is applicable to devices in communication 
        networks.  Target devices for this specification include (but 
        are not limited to): routers, switches, Power over Ethernet 
        (PoE) endpoints, protocol gateways for building management 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 31, 2012            [Page 3] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Power and Energy Monitoring MIB>   October 2011 
      
        systems, intelligent meters, home energy gateways, hosts and 
        servers, sensor proxies, etc. Target devices and the use cases 
        for Energy Management are discussed in Energy Management 
        Applicability Statement [EMAN-AS]. 
         
        Where applicable, device monitoring extends to the individual 
        components of the device and to any attached dependent devices. 
        For example: A device can contain components that are 
        independent from a power-state point of view, such as line 
        cards, processor cards, hard drives.  A device can also have 
        dependent attached devices, such as a switch with PoE endpoints 
        or a power distribution unit with attached endpoints. 
         
        Devices and their sub-components may be characterized by the 
        power-related attributes of a physical entity present in the 
        ENTITY MIB, even though the ENTITY MIB compliance is not a 
        requirement due to the variety and broad base of devices 
        concerned with energy management. 
         
         
     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
        current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
        section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to 
        SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, 
        RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
         
         
     3. Use Cases 

        Requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking 
        devices are specified in [EMAN-REQ].  The requirements in [EMAN-
        REQ] cover devices typically found in communications networks, 
        such as switches, routers, and various connected endpoints.  For 
        a power monitoring architecture to be useful, it should also 
        apply to facility meters, power distribution units, gateway 
        proxies for commercial building control, home automation 
        devices, and devices that interface with the utility and/or 
        smart grid.  Accordingly, the scope of the MIB modules in this 
        document is broader than that specified in [EMAN-REQ].  Several

     Internet-Draft <Power and Energy Monitoring MIB>   October 2011 
      
        use cases for Energy Management have been identified in the 
        "Energy Management (EMAN) Applicability Statement" [EMAN-AS]. An 
        illustrative example scenario is presented in Section 8.  
         
         
     4. Terminology 

          The definitions of basic terms such as  Energy Object, Energy 
          Object Parent, Energy Object Child, Energy Object Meter 
          Domain, Power State can be found in the terminology draft 
          draft-parello-eman-definitions.  
         
      
        Power State Set 
         
          A Power State Set is defined as a sequence of incremental 
          energy saving modes of a device.  The elements of this set can 
          be viewed as an interface for the underlying device-
          implemented power settings of a device.  Examples of Power 
          State Sets include DTMF [DMTF], IEEE1621 [IEEE1621], ACPI 
          [ACPI] and EMAN.  
           
          EDITOR NOTE: Use the latest definition from draft-parello-
          eman-definitions 
         
        Power State 
         
          A Power State is defined as a specific power setting for an  
          Energy Object (e.g., shut, hibernate, sleep, high). Within the 
          context of a Power State Set, the Power State of a device is 
          one of the power saving modes in that Power State Set.

          eman-definitions 
      
      
      
         
         
     5. Architecture Concepts Applied to the MIB Module 

        This section describes the concepts specified in the Energy 
        Management Framework [EMAN-FRAMEWORK] that pertain to power 
        usage, with specific information related to the MIB module 
        specified in this document.  This subsection maps to the section 
        "Architecture High Level Concepts" in the Power Monitoring 
        Architecture [EMAN-FRAMEWORK].

     5.1. Energy Object Information 

        Refer to the "Energy Object Information" section in [EMAN-
        FRAMEWORK] for background information.  An energy aware device 
        is considered as an instance of a Energy Object as defined in 
        the [EMAN-FRAMEWORK]. 
         
        The Energy Object identity information is specified in the MIB 
        ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] primary table, i.e. the 
        eoTable. In this table, every Energy Object SHOULD have a 
        printable name eoName, and MUST HAVE a unique Energy Object 
        index eoIndex.  The ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module returns the 
        relationship (parent/child) between Energy Objects . 
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: this last sentence will have to be updated with 
        terms such as Aggregator, Proxy, etc... when the [EMAN-
        FRAMEWORK] will stabilize. 
      

     5.2. Power State 

        Refer to the "Power States" section in [EMAN-FRAMEWORK] for 
        background information. 
         
        An Energy Object may have energy conservation modes called Power 
        States.  Between the ON and OFF states of a device, there can be 
        several intermediate energy saving modes.  Those energy saving 
        modes are called as Power States.  
         
        Power States, which represent universal states of power 
        management of  an Energy Object, are specified by the 
        eoPowerState MIB object.  The actual Power State is specified by 
        the eoPowerOperState MIB object, while the eoPowerAdminState MIB 
        object specifies the Power State requested for the Energy 
        Object.  The difference between the values of eoPowerOperState 
        and eoPowerAdminState  can be attributed that the Energy Object 
        is busy transitioning from eoPowerAdminState into the 
        eoPowerOperState, at which point it will update the content of 
        eoPowerOperState.  In addition, the possible reason for change

        The MIB objects eoPowerOperState, eoPowerAdminState , and 
        eoPowerStateEnterReason are contained in the eoPowerTable MIB 
        table. 
            
        The eoPowerStateTable table enumerates the maximum power usage 
        in watts, for every single supported Power State of each Power 
        State Set supported by the Energy Object. In addition, 
        PowerStateTable provides additional statistics: 
        eoPowerStateEnterCount, the number of times an entity has 
        visited a particular Power State, and eoPowerStateTotalTime, the 
        total time spent in a particular Power State of an Energy 
        Object.  
         
         
     5.2.1. Power State Set 

        There are several standards and implementations of Power State 
        Sets.  A Energy Object can support one or multiple Power State 
        Set implementation(s) concurrently.  
         
        There are currently three Power State Sets advocated:   
         
          unknown(0) 
          IEEE1621(256) - [IEEE1621] 
          DMTF(512)     - [DMTF] 
          EMAN(1024)     - [EMAN-MONITORING-MIB] 
        
       The respective specific states related to each Power State Set 
        are specified in the following sections. The guidelines for 
        addition of new Power State Sets have been specified in the IANA 
        Considerations Section.  
        
         
     5.2.2. IEEE1621 Power State Set 

        The IEEE1621 Power State Set [IEEE1621] consists of 3 
        rudimentary states : on, off or sleep. 
          on(0)    - The device is fully On and all features of the 
        device are in working mode.  
          off(1)   - The device is mechanically switched off and does 
        not consume energy.  
          sleep(2) - The device is in a power saving mode, and some 
        features may not be available immediately. 
         
        The Textual Convention IANAPowerStateSet provides the proposed 
        numbering of the Power States within the IEEE1621 Power State 
        Set.

     5.2.3. DMTF Power State Set 

        DMTF [DMTF] standards organization has defined a power profile 
        standard based on the CIM (Common Information Model) model that 
        consists of 15 power states ON (2), SleepLight (3), SleepDeep 
        (4), Off-Hard (5), Off-Soft (6), Hibernate(7), PowerCycle Off-
        Soft (8), PowerCycle Off-Hard (9), MasterBus reset (10), 
        Diagnostic Interrupt (11), Off-Soft-Graceful (12), Off-Hard 
        Graceful (13), MasterBus reset Graceful (14), Power-Cycle Off-
        Soft Graceful (15), PowerCycle-Hard Graceful (16).  DMTF 
        standard is targeted for hosts and computers.  Details of the 
        semantics of each Power State within the DMTF Power State Set 
        can be obtained from the DMTF Power State Management Profile 
        specification [DMTF]. 
         
        DMTF power profile extends ACPI power states.  The following 
        table provides a mapping between DMTF and ACPI Power State Set:

        The Textual Convention IANAPowerStateSet contains the proposed 
        numbering of the Power States within the DMTF Power State Set. 
            
            
     5.2.4. EMAN Power State Set 

        The EMAN Power State Set represents an attempt for a uniform 
        standard approach to model the different levels of power 
        consumption of a device.  The EMAN Power States are an expansion 
        of the basic Power States as defined in IEEE1621 that also 
        incorporate the Power States defined in ACPI and DMTF.  
        Therefore, in addition to the non-operational states as defined 
        in ACPI and DMTF standards, several intermediate operational 
        states have been defined.  
         
        There are twelve Power States, that expand on IEEE1621 on,sleep 
        and off.  The expanded list of Power States are divided into six  
        operational states, and six non-operational states.  The lowest 
        non-operational state is 1 and the highest is 6.  Each non-
        operational state corresponds to an ACPI state [ACPI] 
        corresponding to Global and System states between G3 (hard-off) 
        and G1 (sleeping). For Each operational state represent a 
        performance state, and may be mapped to ACPI states P0 (maximum 
        performance power) through P5 (minimum performance and minimum 
        power).  
         
        An Energy Object may have fewer Power States than twelve and 
        would then map several policy states to the same power state. 
        Energy Object with more than twelve states, would choose which 
        twelve to represent as power policy states. 
         
        In each of the non-operational states (from mechoff(1) to 
        ready(6)), the Power State preceding it is expected to have a 
        lower power consumption and a longer delay in returning to an 
        operational state:

        IEEE1621 Power(off): 
         
                 mechoff(1)  : An off state where no entity features are 
                               available.  The entity is unavailable. 
                               No energy is being consumed and the power 
                               connector can be removed.  This  
                               corresponds to ACPI state G3.      
                      
                 softoff(2)  : Similar to mechoff(1), but some  
                               components remain powered or receive 
                               trace power so that the entity  
                               can be awakened from its off state.  In  
                               softoff(2), no context is saved and the  
                               device typically requires a complete boot  
                               when awakened.  This corresponds to ACPI  
                               state G2. 
         
        IEEE1621 Power(sleep) 
         
                 hibernate(3): No entity features are available.  The 
                               entity may be awakened without requiring  
                               a complete boot, but the time for  
                               availability is longer than sleep(4). An  
                               example for state hibernate(3) is a save 
                               to-disk state where DRAM context is not  
                               maintained. Typically, energy consumption  
                               is zero or close to zero.  This  
                               corresponds to state G1, S4 in ACPI. 
         
                 sleep(4)    : No entity features are available, except  
                               for out-of-band management, for example   
                               wake-up mechanisms. The time for  
                               availability is longer than standby(5).  
                               An example for state sleep(4) is a save- 
                               to-RAM state, where DRAM context is  
                               maintained.  Typically, energy  
                               consumption is close to zero. This  
                               corresponds to state G1, S3 in ACPI. 
         
                 standby(5) : No entity features are available, except  
                              for out-of-band management, for example  
                              wake-up mechanisms. This mode is analogous   
                              to cold-standy.  The time for availability  
                              is longer than ready(6).  For example, the  
                              processor context is not maintained.

                               analogous to hot-standby.  The entity can  
                               be quickly transitioned into an  
                               operational state.  For example,  
                               processors are not executing, but  
                               processor context is maintained. This

     5.3. Energy Object Usage Information 

        Refer to the "Energy Object Usage Measurement" section in [EMAN-
        FRAMEWORK] for background information. 
         
        For an Energy Object, power usage is reported using eoPower.  
        The magnitude of measurement is based on the 
        eoPowerUnitMultiplier MIB variable, based on the UnitMultiplier 
        Textual Convention (TC). Power measurement magnitude should 
        conform to the IEC 62053-21 [IEC.62053-21] and IEC 62053-22 
        [IEC.62053-22]  definition of unit multiplier for the SI (System 
        International) units of measure.  Measured values are 
        represented in SI units obtained by BaseValue * 10 raised to the 
        power of the scale.   
           
        For example, if current power usage of an Energy Object is 3, it 
        could be 3 W, 3 mW, 3 KW, or 3 MW, depending on the value of 
        eoPowerUnitMultiplier.  Note that other measurements throughout 
        the two MIB modules in this document use the same mechanism, 
        including eoPowerStatePowerUnitMultiplier, 
        eoEnergyIntervalEnergyUnitMultiplier, and 
        eoACPwrQualityPowerUnitMultiplier. 
         
        In addition to knowing the usage and magnitude, it is useful to 
        know how a eoPower measurement was obtained.  An NMS can use 
        this to account for the accuracy and nature of the reading 
        between different implementations.  For this eoPowerOrigin 
        describes whether the measurements were made at the device 
        itself or from a remote source.  The eoPowerMeasurementCaliber 
        describes the method that was used to measure the power and can 
        distinguish actual or estimated values.  There may be devices in 
        the network, which may not be able to measure or report power 
        consumption. For those devices, the object

        The optional powerQualityMIB MIB module can be implemented to 
        further describe power usage quality measurement.  The 
        powerQualityMIB MIB module adheres closely to the IEC 61850 7-2 
        standard to describe AC measurements.   
         
        The powerQualityMIB MIB module contains a primary table, the 
        eoACPwrQualityTable table, that defines power quality 
        measurements for supported  eoPowerIndex entities, as a sparse 
        extension of the eoPowerTable (with eoPowerIndex as primary 
        index).  This eoACPwrQualityTable table contains such 
        information as the configuration (single phase, DEL 3 phases, 
        WYE 3 phases), voltage, frequency, power accuracy, total 
        active/reactive power/apparent power, amperage, and voltage.  
         
        In case of 3-phase power, the eoACPwrQualityPhaseTable 
        additional table is populated with power quality measurements 
        per phase (so double indexed by the eoPowerIndex and 
        eoPhaseIndex).  This table, which describes attributes common to 
        both WYE and DEL configurations, contains the average current, 
        active/reactive/apparent power, power factor, and impedance. 
         
        In case of 3-phase power with a DEL configuration, the 
        eoACPwrQualityDelPhaseTable table describes the phase-to-phase 
        power quality measurements, i.e., voltage and current. 
         
        In case of 3-phase power with a Wye configuration, the 
        eoACPwrQualityWyePhaseTable table describes the phase-to-neutral 
        power quality measurements, i.e., voltage and current. 
         
         
     5.5. Optional Energy Measurement 

        Refer to the "Optional Energy and demand Measurement" section in 
        [EMAN-FRAMEWORK] for the definition and terminology information. 
         
        It is relevant to measure energy when there are actual power 
        measurements from an Energy Object, and not when the power 
        measurement is assumed or predicted as specified in the 
        description clause of the object eoPowerMeasurementCaliber.    
         
        Two tables are introduced to characterize energy measurement of 
        an  Energy Object:  eoEnergyTable and eoEnergyParametersTable.  
        Both energy and demand information can be represented via the 
        eoEnergyTable.  Energy information will be an accumulation with 
        no interval.  Demand information can be represented as an 
        average accumulation per interval of time.

        The eoEnergyParametersTable consists of the parameters defining 
        the duration of measurement intervals in seconds, 
        (eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength), the number of successive 
        intervals to be stored in the eoEnergyTable, 
        (eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber), the type of measurement 
        technique (eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode), and a sample rate 
        used to calculate the average (eoEnergyParametersSampleRate).  
        Judicious choice of the sampling rate will ensure accurate 
        measurement of energy while not imposing an excessive polling 
        burden. 
           
        There are three eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode types used for 
        energy measurement collection: period, sliding, and total. The 
        choices of the the three different modes of collection are based 
        on IEC standard 61850-7-4.  Note that multiple 
        eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode types MAY be configured 
        simultaneously.   
         
        These three eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode types are illustrated 
        by the following three figures, for which: 
         
        - The horizontal axis represents the current time, with the 
        symbol <--- L ---> expressing the 
        eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength, and the 
        eoEnergyIntervalStartTime is represented by S1, S2, S3, S4, ..., 
        Sx where x is the value of eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber. 
         
        - The vertical axis represents the time interval of sampling and 
        the value of eoEnergyIntervalEnergyUsed can be obtained at the 
        end of the sampling period.  The symbol =========== denotes the 
        duration of the sampling period.

        A eoEnergyParametersIntervalMode type of 'total' specifies a 
        continuous measurement since the last reset.  The value of 
        eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber should be (1) one and 
        eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength is ignored. 
         
        The eoEnergyParametersStatus is used to start and stop energy 
        usage logging.  The status of this variable is "active"  when 
        all the objects in eoEnergyParametersTable are appropriate which 
        in turn indicates if eoEnergyTable entries exist or not. 
         
        The eoEnergyTable consists of energy measurements in 
        eoEnergyIntervalEnergyUsed , the units of the measured energy 
        eoEnergyIntervalEnergyUnitMultiplier, and the maximum observed 
        energy within a window - eoEnergyIntervalMax.    
         
        Measurements of the total energy consumed by an Energy Object 
        may suffer from interruptions in the continuous measurement of 
        energy consumption.  In order to indicate such interruptions, 
        the object eoEnergyIntervalDiscontinuityTime is provided for 
        indicating the time of the last interruption of total energy 
        measurement.  eoEnergyIntervalDiscontinuityTime shall indicate 
        the sysUpTime [RFC3418] when the device was reset.  
         
        The following example illustrates the eoEnergyTable and 
        eoEnergyParametersTable: 
         
        First, in order to estimate energy, a time interval to sample 
        energy should be specified, i.e. 
        eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength can be set to "900 seconds" or 
        15 minutes and the number of consecutive intervals over which 
        the maximum energy is calculated 
        (eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber) as "10".  The sampling rate 
        internal to the Energy Object for measurement of power usage 
        (eoEnergyParametersSampleRate) can be "1000 milliseconds", as 
        set by the Energy Object as a reasonable value.  Then, the 
        eoEnergyParametersStatus is set to active (value 1) to indicate 
        that the Energy Object should start monitoring the usage per the 
        eoEnergyTable. 
         
        The indices for  the eoEnergyTable are eoPowerIndex, which 
        identifies the  Energy Object, and eoEnergyIntervalStartTime, 
        which denotes the start time of the energy measurement interval 
        based on sysUpTime [RFC3418].  The value of 
        eoEnergyIntervalEnergyUsed is the measured energy consumption 
        over the time interval specified 
        (eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength) based on the Energy Object 
        internal sampling rate (eoEnergyParametersSampleRate).  While 
        choosing the values for the eoEnergyParametersIntervalLength and 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 31, 2012           [Page 22] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Power and Energy Monitoring MIB>   October 2011 
      
        eoEnergyParametersSampleRate, it is recommended to take into 
        consideration either the network element resources adequate to 
        process and store the sample values, and the mechanism used to 
        calculate the eoEnergyIntervalEnergyUsed.  The units are derived 
        from eoEnergyIntervalPowerUnitMultiplier.  For example, 
        eoEnergyIntervalPowerUsed can be "100" with 
        eoEnergyIntervalPowerUnits equal to 0, the measured energy 
        consumption of the Energy Object is 100 watt-hours.  The 
        eoEnergyIntervalMax is the maximum energy observed and that can 
        be "150 watt-hours". 
         
        The eoEnergyTable has a buffer to retain a certain number of 
        intervals, as defined by eoEnergyParametersIntervalNumber.  If 
        the default value of "10" is kept, then the eoEnergyTable 
        contains 10 energy measurements, including the maximum.   
         
        Here is a brief explanation of how the maximum energy can be 
        calculated.  The first observed energy measurement value is 
        taken to be the initial maximum.  With each subsequent 
        measurement, based on numerical comparison, maximum energy may 
        be updated.  The maximum value is retained as long as the 
        measurements are taking place.  Based on periodic polling of 
        this table, an NMS could compute the maximum over a longer 
        period, i.e. a month, 3 months, or a year. 
      

     5.6. Fault Management 

        [EMAN-REQ] specifies requirements about Power States such as 
        "the current power state" , "the time of the last state change", 
        "the total time spent in each state", "the number of transitions 
        to each state" etc. Some of these requirements are fulfilled 
        explicitly by MIB objects such as eoPowerOperState, 
        eoPowerStateTotalTime and eoPowerStateEnterCount.  Some of the 
        other requirements are met via the SNMP NOTIFICATION mechanism.  
        eoPowerStateChange SNMP notification which is generated when the 
        value(s) of ,eoPowerStateIndex, eoPowerOperState, 
        eoPowerAdminState have changed.  
         
          
     6. Discovery 

     6.1. ENERGY-AWARE-MIB Module Implemented 

        The NMS must first poll the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-
        MIB], if available, in order to discover all the Energy Objects 
        and the relationships between those (notion of Parent/Child).  

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 31, 2012           [Page 23] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Power and Energy Monitoring MIB>   October 2011 
      
        In the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module tables, the Energy Objects are 
        indexed by the eoIndex.   

        If an implementation of the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module is available 
        in the local SNMP context, for the same Energy Object , the 
        eoIndex value (EMAN-AWARE-MIB) MUST be assigned to the 
        eoPowerIndex. The eoPowerIndex characterizes the  Energy Object 
        in the energyObjectMib and powerQualityMIB MIB modules (this 
        document). 

        From there, the NMS must poll the eoPowerStateTable (specified 
        in the energyObjectMib module in this document), which 
        enumerates, amongst other things, the maximum power usage.  As 
        the entries in eoPowerStateTable table are indexed by the  
        Energy Object (eoPowerIndex), by the Power State Set 
        (eoPowerStateIndex), the maximum power usage is discovered per  
        Energy Object, per Power State Set, and per Power Usage.  In 
        other words, polling the eoPowerStateTable allows the discovery 
        of each Power State within every Power State Set supported by 
        the  Energy Object.               

        If the  Energy Object is an Aggregator or a Proxy, the MIB 
        module would be populated with the  Energy Object Parent and 
        Children information, which have their own  Energy Object index 
        value (eoPowerIndex).  However, the parent/child relationship 
        must be discovered thanks to the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module. 

        Finally, the NMS can monitor the Power Quality thanks to the 
        powerQualityMIB MIB module, which reuses the eoPowerIndex to 
        index the  Energy Object. 

     6.2. ENERGY-AWARE-MIB Module Not Implemented, ENTITY-MIB 
        Implemented 

        When the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] is not 
        implemented, the NMS must poll the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133] in order 
        to discover some more information about the Energy Objects.  
        Indeed, the index for the Energy Objects in the MIB modules 
        specified in this document is the eoPowerIndex, which specifies: 
        "If there is no implementation of the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module 
        but one of the ENTITY MIB module is available in the local SNMP 
        context, then the same index of an entity MUST be chosen as 
        assigned to the entity by object entPhysicalIndex in the ENTITY 
        MIB module." 
      
        As described in Section 6.1.  the NMS must then poll the 
        eoPowerStateTable (specified in the energyObjectMib module in 
        this document), indexed by the Energy Object (eoPowerIndex that 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 31, 2012           [Page 24]

        inherited the entPhysicalIndex value),  by the Power State 
        (eoPowerStateIndex).  Then the NMS has discovered every Power 
        State within each Power State Set supported by the Energy 
        Object.  
         
        Note that, without the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module, the Energy 
        Object acts as an standalone device, i.e. the notion of 
        parent/child can't be specified. 
                      
      

     6.3. ENERGY-AWARE-MIB Module and ENTITY-MIB Not Implemented 

        If neither the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] nor of 
        the ENTITY MIB module [RFC4133] are available in the local SNMP 
        context, then this MIB module may choose identity values from a 
        further MIB module providing entity identities.  
         
        Note that, without the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module, the Energy 
        Object acts as a standalone device, i.e. the notion of 
        parent/child can't be specified. 
      
                                      
     7. Link with the other IETF MIBs 

         
     7.1. Link with the ENTITY MIB and the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB  

        RFC 4133 [RFC4133] defines the ENTITY MIB module that lists the 
        physical entities of a networking device (router, switch, etc.) 
        and those physical entities indexed by entPhysicalIndex.  From 
        an energy-management standpoint, the physical entities that 
        consume or produce energy are of interest. 
         
        RFC 3433 [RFC3433] defines the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB module that 
        provides a standardized way of obtaining information (current 
        value of the sensor, operational status of the sensor, and the 
        data units precision) from sensors embedded in networking 
        devices.  Sensors are associated with each index of 
        entPhysicalIndex of the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133].  While the focus 
        of the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB is on measurement of 
        power usage of networking equieoent indexed by the ENTITY MIB, 
        this MIB proposes a customized power scale for power measurement 
        and different power state states of networking equipment, and 
        functionality to configure the power state states. 
         
        When this MIB module is used to monitor the power usage of 
        devices like routers and switches, the ENTITY MIB and ENTITY-

     Internet-Draft <Power and Energy Monitoring MIB>   October 2011 
      
        SENSOR MIB SHOULD be implemented.  In such cases, the Energy 
        Objects are modeled by the entPhysicalIndex through the 
        entPhysicalEntity MIB object specified in the eoTable in the 
        ENERGY-AWARE-MIB MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB].   

        However, the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433] does not have the ANSI 
        C12.x accuracy classes required for electricity (i.e., 1%, 2%, 
        0.5% accuracy classes). Indeed, entPhySensorPrecision [RFC3433] 
        represents "The number of decimal places of precision in fixed-
        point sensor values returned by the associated entPhySensorValue 
        object".  The ANSI and IEC Standards are used for power 
        measurement and these standards require that we use an accuracy 
        class, not the scientific-number precision model specified in 
        RFC3433.  The eoPowerAccuracy MIB object models this accuracy.  
        Note that eoPowerUnitMultipler represents the scale factor per 
        IEC 62053-21 [IEC.62053-21] and IEC 62053-22 [IEC.62053-22], 
        which is a more logical representation for power measurements 
        (compared to entPhySensorScale), with the mantissa and the 
        exponent values X * 10 ^ Y. 

        Power measurements specifying the qualifier 'UNITS' for each 
        measured value in watts are used in the LLDP-EXT-MED-MIB, POE 
        [RFC3621], and UPS [RFC1628] MIBs.  The same 'UNITS' qualifier 
        is used for the power measurement values.    
         
        One cannot assume that the ENTITY MIB and ENTITY-SENSOR MIB are 
        implemented for all Energy Objects that need to be monitored.  A 
        typical example is a converged building gateway, monitoring 
        several other devices in the building, doing the proxy between 
        SNMP and a protocol like BACNET.  Another example is the home 
        energy controller.  In such cases, the eoPhysicalEntity value 
        contains the zero value, thanks to PhysicalIndexOrZero textual 
        convention. 
         
        The eoPowerIndex MIB object has been kept as the unique index of 
        the Energy Object. The eoPower is similar to entPhySensorValue 
        [RFC3433] and the eoPowerUnitMultipler is similar to 
        entPhySensorScale. 
         
         
     7.2. Link with the ENTITY-STATE MIB  

        For each entity in the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133], the ENTITY-STATE 
        MIB [RFC4268] specifies the operational states (entStateOper: 
        unknown, enabled, disabled, testing), the alarm (entStateAlarm: 
        unknown, underRepair, critical, major, minor, warning, 
        indeterminate) and the possible values of standby states  

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 31, 2012           [Page 26]

        (entStateStandby: unknown, hotStandby, coldStandby, 
        providingService). 
         
        From a power monitoring point of view, in contrast to the entity 
        operational states of entities, Power States are required, as 
        proposed in the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB module.  Those 
        Power States can be mapped to the different operational states 
        in the ENTITY-STATE MIB, if a formal mapping is required.  For 
        example, the entStateStandby "unknown", "hotStandby", 
        "coldStandby", states could map to the Power State "unknown", 
        "ready", "standby", respectively, while the entStateStandby 
        "providingService" could map to any "low" to "high" Power State. 
         
         
     7.3. Link with the POWER-OVER-ETHERNET MIB 

        Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] provides an energy monitoring 
        and configuration framework for power over Ethernet devices.  
        The RFC introduces a concept of a port group on a switch to 
        define power monitoring and management policy and does not use 
        the entPhysicalIndex as the index.  Indeed, the  
        pethMainPseConsumptionPower is indexed by the 
        pethMainPseGroupIndex, which has no mapping with the 
        entPhysicalIndex.  
         
        One cannot assume that the Power-over-Ethernet MIB is 
        implemented for all Energy Objects that need to be monitored.  A 
        typical example is a converged building gateway, monitoring 
        several other devices in the building, doing the proxy between 
        SNMP and a protocol like BACNET.  Another example is the home 
        energy controller.  In such cases, the eoethPortIndex and 
        eoethPortGrpIndex values contain the zero value, thanks to new 
        PethPsePortIndexOrZero and textual PethPsePortGroupIndexOrZero 
        conventions. 
         
        However, if the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, 
        the Energy Object eoethPortIndex and eoethPortGrpIndex contain 
        the pethPsePortIndex and pethPsePortGroupIndex, respectively. 
         
        As a consequence, the eoIndex MIB object has been kept as the 
        unique Energy Object index. 
         
        Note that, even though the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] was 
        created after the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433], it does not reuse 
        the precision notion from the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB, i.e. the 
        entPhySensorPrecision MIB object.

     7.4. Link with the UPS MIB 

        To protect against unexpected power disruption, data centers and 
        buildings make use of Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS).  To 
        protect critical assets, a UPS can be restricted to a particular 
        subset or domain of the network.  UPS usage typically lasts only 
        for a finite period of time, until normal power supply is 
        restored.  Planning is required to decide on the capacity of the 
        UPS based on output power and duration of probable power outage.  
        To properly provision UPS power in a data center or building, it 
        is important to first understand the total demand required to 
        support all the entities in the site.  This demand can be 
        assessed and monitored via the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB.  

        UPS MIB [RFC1628] provides information on the state of the UPS 
        network.  Implementation of the UPS MIB is useful at the 
        aggregate level of a data center or a building.  The MIB module 
        contains several groups of variables: 

        - upsIdent: Identifies the UPS entity (name, model, etc.).  

        - upsBattery group: Indicates the battery state 
        (upsbatteryStatus, upsEstimatedMinutesRemaining, etc.) 

        - upsInput group: Characterizes the input load to the UPS 
        (number of input lines, voltage, current, etc.). 

        - upsOutput: Characterizes the output from the UPS (number of 
        output lines, voltage, current, etc.) 

        - upsAlarms: Indicates the various alarm events.   

        The measurement of power in the UPS MIB is in Volts, Amperes and 
        Watts.  The units of power measurement are RMS volts and RMS 
        Amperes. They are not based on the EntitySensorDataScale and 
        EntitySensorDataPrecision of Entity-Sensor MIB. 

        Both the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB and the UPS MIB may be 
        implemented on the same UPS SNMP agent, without conflict.  In 
        this case, the UPS device itself is the Energy Object Parent and 
        any of the UPS meters or submeters are the Energy Object 
        Children.

     7.5. Link with the LLDP and LLDP-MED MIBs 

        The LLDP Protocol is a Data Link Layer protocol used by network 
        devices to advertise their identities, capabilities, and 
        interconnections on a LAN network.  
         
        The Media Endpoint Discovery is an enhancement of LLDP, known as 
        LLDP-MED.  The LLDP-MED enhancements specifically address voice 
        applications.  LLDP-MED covers 6 basic areas: capability 
        discovery, LAN speed and duplex discovery, network policy 
        discovery, location identification discovery, inventory 
        discovery, and power discovery.   
         
        Of particular interest to the current MIB module is the power 
        discovery, which allows the endpoint device (such as a PoE 
        phone) to convey power requirements to the switch.  In power 
        discovery, LLDP-MED has four Type Length Values (TLVs): power 
        type, power source, power priority and power value.  
        Respectively, those TLVs provide information related to the type 
        of power (power sourcing entity versus powered device), how the 
        device is powered (from the line, from a backup source, from 
        external power source, etc.), the power priority (how important 
        is it that this device has power?), and how much power the 
        device needs. 
          
        The power priority specified in the LLDP-MED MIB [LLDP-MED-MIB] 
        actually comes from the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621]. If 
        the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, the exact 
        value from the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621] is copied over 
        in the lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority [LLDP-MED-MIB]; otherwise 
        the value in lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority is "unknown". From 
        the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB, it is possible to identify 
        the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621], thanks to the 
        eoethPortIndex and eoethPortGrpIndex. 
         
        The lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource [LLDP-MED-MIB] is similar to 
        eoPowerOrigin in indicating if the power for an attached device 
        is local or from a remote device. If the LLDP-MED MIB is 
        supported, the following mapping can be applied to the 
        eoPowerOrigin: lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource fromPSE(2) and 
        local(3) can be mapped to remote(2) and self(1), respectively. 
      

     8. Implementation Scenario

     Internet-Draft <Power and Energy Monitoring MIB>   October 2011 
      
        This section provides an illustrative example scenario for the 
        implementation of the Energy Object, including Energy Object 
        Parent and Energy Object Child relationships.  
         
        Example Scenario of a campus network: Switch with PoE Endpoints 
        with further connected Devices  
         
        The campus network consists of switches that provide LAN 
        connectivity.  The switch with PoE ports is located in wiring 
        closet.  PoE IP phones are connected to the switch.  The IP 
        phones draw power from the PoE ports of the switch.  In 
        addition, a PC is daisy-chained from the IP phone for LAN 
        connectivity.   
         
        The IP phone consumes power from the PoE switch, while the PC 
        consumes power from the wall outlet.  
         
        The switch has implementations of Entity MIB [RFC4133] and 
        energy-aware MIB [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] while the PC does not have 
        implementation of the Entity MIB, but has an implementation of 
        energy-aware MIB.  The switch has the following attributes, 
        eoPowerIndex "1", eoPhysicalEntity "2", and eoUUID "UUID 1000".  
        The power usage of the switch is "440 Watts".  The switch does 
        not have an Energy Object Parent. 
         
        The PoE switch port has the following attributes: The switch 
        port has eoPowerIndex "3", eoPhysicalEntity is "12" and eoUUID 
        is "UUID 1000:3".  The power metered at the POE switch port is 
        "12 watts".  In this example, the POE switch port has the switch 
        as the Energy Object Parent, with its eoParentID of "1000". 
      
        The attributes of the PC are given below.  The PC does not 
        implementation of Entity MIB, and thus does not have 
        eoPhysicalEntity.  The eoPowerIndex (eoIndex) of the PC is "57", 
        the eoUUID is "UUID 1000:57 ".  The PC has an Energy Object 
        Parent, i.e. the switch port whose eoUUID is "UUID 1000:3".  The 
        power usage of the PC is "120 Watts" and is communicated to the 
        switch port.  
         
        This example illustrates the important distinction between the 
        Energy Object Children: The IP phone draws power from the 
        switch, while the PC has LAN connectivity from the phone, but is 
        powered from the wall outlet.  However, the Energy Object Parent 
        sends power control messages to both the Energy Object Children 
        (IP phone and PC) and the Children react to those messages.

     9. Structure of the MIB 

        The primary MIB object in this MIB module is the 
        energyObjectMibObject.  The eoPowerTable table of 
        energyObjectMibObject describes the power measurement attributes 
        of an Energy Object entity. The notion of identity of the device 
        in terms of uniquely identification of the Energy Object and its 
        relationship to other entities in the network are addressed in 
        [EMAN-AWARE-MIB].   
          
         
        The power measurement of an Energy Object contains information 
        describing its power usage (eoPower) and its current power state 
        (eoPowerOperState). In addition to power usage, additional 
        information describing the units of measurement 
        (eoPowerAccuracy, eoPowerUnitMultiplier), how power usage 
        measurement was obtained  (eoPowerMeasurementCaliber),  the 
        source of power  (eoPowerOrigin) and the type of power 
        (eoPowerCurrentTtype) are described. 
         
         
        An Energy Object may contain an optional eoPowerQuality table 
        that describes the electrical characteristics associated with 
        the current power state and usage. 
         
        An Energy Object may contain an optional eoEnergyTable to 
        describe energy measurement information over time. 
         
        An Energy Object may also contain optional battery information 
        associated with this entity.

        Power State Sets and Power State Set Values an Energy Object  
        supports. IANA has created a registry of Power State supported 
        by an Energy Object and IANA shall administer the list of Power 
        State Sets and Power States. 
         
          The textual convention assumes that power states in a power 
          state set are limited to 255 distinct values. For a Power 
          State Set S, the named number with the value S * 256 is 
          allocated to indicate the power state set. For a Power State X 
          in the Power State S, the named number with the value S * 256 
          + X + 1 is allocated to represent the power state."

              entities without an assigned value for eoIndex cannot be 
              indexed by the eoPowerStateTable.

              module but one of the ENTITY MIB module is available in

              from one re-initialization of the entity's network

     11. Security Considerations 

        Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
        thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these 
        objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects 
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.   
         
        There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB 
        modules with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
        create.  Such objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable 
        in some network environments.  The support for SET operations in 
        a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
        negative effect on network operations.  The following are the 
        tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         
        - Unauthorized changes to the eoPowerOperState (via 
          theeoPowerAdminState ) MAY disrupt the power settings of the 
          differentEnergy Objects, and therefore the state of 
          functionality of the respective Energy Objects. 
        - Unauthorized changes to the eoEnergyParametersTable MAY 
          disrupt energy measurement in the eoEnergyTable table.  
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 31, 2012           [Page 69] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Power and Energy Monitoring MIB>   October 2011 
      
         
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using 
        IPsec), there is still no secure control over who on the secure 
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB modules. 
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 
         

     12. IANA Considerations 

     12.1. IANA Considerations for the MIB Modules 

      

        The MIB modules in this document uses the following IANA-
        assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers 
        registry: 
         
               Descriptor            OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
               ----------            ----------------------- 
               energyObjectMib         { mib-2 xxx } 
               powerQualityMIB         { mib-2 yyy } 
         
        Additions to the MIB modules are subject to Expert Review

     12.2. IANA Registration of new Power State Set 

        This document specifies an initial set of Power State Sets. The 
        list of these Power State Sets with their numeric identifiers is 
        given in Section 5.2.1.  IANA maintains a Textual Convention 
        IANAPowerStateSet with the initial set of Power State Sets and 
        the Power States within those Power State Sets. The current 
        version of Textual convention can be accessed 
        http://www.iana.org/assignments/IANAPowerStateSet 
         
        New Assignments to Power State Sets shall be administered by 
        IANA and the guidelines and procedures are listed in this 
        Section.  
      
        New assignments for Power State Set will be administered by IANA 
        through Expert Review [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group 
        of experts designated by an IETF Area Director.  The group of 
        experts MUST check the requested state for completeness and 
        accuracy of the description. A pure vendor specific 
        implementation of Power State Set shall not be adopted; since it 
        would lead to proliferation of Power State Sets.  
      
         
      
     12.2.1. IANA Registration of the IEEE1621 Power State Set 

        This document specifies a set of values for the IEEE1621 Power 
        State Set [IEEE1621].  The list of these values with their 
        identifiers is given in Section 5.2.1.  The Internet Assigned 
        Numbers Authority (IANA) created a new registry for IEEE1621 
        Power State Set identifiers and filled it with the initial 
        listin the Textual Convention IANAPowerStateSet..  
         
        New assignments (or potentially deprecation) for IEEE1621 Power 
        State Set will be administered by IANA through Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested state for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description. 
         
     12.2.2. IANA Registration of the DMTF Power State Set 

        This document specifies a set of values for the DMTF Power State 
        Set.  The list of these values with their identifiers is given 
        in Section 5.2.1.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority 
        (IANA) has created a new registry for DMTF Power State Set 
        identifiers and filled it with the initial list in  the Textual 
        Convention IANAPowerStateSet.

     12.2.3. IANA Registration of the EMAN Power State Set 

        This document specifies a set of values for the EMAN Power State 
        Set.  The list of these values with their identifiers is given 
        in Section 5.2.1.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority

     14. Open Issues 

         
        OPEN ISSUE 1 : Double-check all the IEC references in the draft.  
         
          IEC 61850-7-4 has been widely referenced in many EMAN drafts.  
          The other IEC references suggested in the email list are   
          IEC 61000-4-30  and IEC 62053-21 and IEC 62301. It is 
          important to resolve the correct IEC references soon.  
           
      
        OPEN ISSUE 2 : Description clause of eoPowerIndex. Do we need 
        this text ? Juergen Quittek to comment:  
         
          "The identity provisioning method that has been chosen can be 
          retrieved by reading the value of powerStateEnergyConsumerOid. 
          In case of identities provided by the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module, 
          this OID points to an exising instance of eoPowerIndex, in 
          case of the ENTITY MIB, the object points to a valid instance 
          of entPhysicalIndex, and in a similar way, it points to a 
          value of another MIB module if this is used for identifying 
          entities. If no other MIB module has been chosen for providing 
          entity identities, then the value of 
          powerStateEnergyConsumerOid MUST be 0.0 (zeroDotZero). 
           
           
         
        OPEN ISSUE 3: Time Series of measurements required ? Mechanism 
        pull or push ?  What shall the table consist of ?   
        Power, Voltage, Current, Energy and Demand.  
         
         
           
        OPEN ISSUE 4: Demand computation method  
           
          "Energy not obtained by periodically polling a power 
          measurement with a eoEnergyParametersSampleRate ; Energy (E) 
          is measured to the product's certified IEC 62053-21 accuracy 
          class"
