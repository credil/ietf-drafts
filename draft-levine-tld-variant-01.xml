      <section title="Introduction">
	 <t>
	    IDNA <xref target="RFC5890" /> provides a method to map a subset
	    of names written in Unicode into <xref target="RFC1035">the DNS</xref>.
	    Some languages allow a particular name to be written in multiple ways that are
	    represented differently in IDNA, known as "variants".
	    In some cases, the variants are multiple equally valid ways of writing the same
	    thing, such as traditional and simplified Chinese characters.
	    Some languages written in Latin characters with accents and diacritical marks,
	    known as decorated characters,
	    allow the decorations to be omitted in some situations, such as French which often
	    omits accents on capital letters.
	    Due to the difficulty of representing decorated characters in ASCII systems,
	    many users have informally used undecorated characters in DNS names, even when
	    they are not linguistically equivalent to the decorated versions.
	 </t>
	 <t>
	    The proper handing of variant names has been a topic of extensive debate and
	    research, with little consensus reached on how to handle them, or even what
	    characters are variants of each other.
	    Many people would like variant names to behave "the same", for a diverse range
	    of meanings of "same."  In some cases it is a textual similarity, such as
	    variants having corresponding DNS records, in some it is functional similarity,
	    such as variant names resolving to the same web server, or the same page in a
	    web server, while in others it is user experience similarity, such as names
	    resolving to web pages which while not identical are perceived by human
	    users as equivalent.
	 </t>
	 <t>
	    This document provides a snapshot of variant handling in the top level domains
	    managed by ICANN, so called gTLDs (generic TLDs) and sTLDs (sponsored TLDs),
	    as of late 2012.
	    We chose those domains because ICANN requires each TLD to describe its IDN and
	    variant practices, and the TLD zone files are available for inspection, to
	    verify what actually goes into the zones.
	 </t>
	 <t>
		The authors note that ICANN has no agreed-on definition of
		"variant". Since "variant" can mean vastly different things to
		different people, there is also no agreement about when
		when two zones are supposed to "behave the same". Also, the
		gTLDs and sTLDs might have different views of what variants are and
		are not required to report to ICANN about their policies.
	 </t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Terminology">
	 <t>We use some terminology that has become fairly well agreed when discussing variant names.</t>
	 <t><list style='hanging'>
	    
	    <t hangText="Bundle:">The IDN practices documents (see below) can identify sets
	       of characters that are considered equivalent using Language Variant Tables,
	       defined in <xref target="RFC3743" />.
	       A set of names in which the characters in each position are equivalent is known as
	       bundle, or more technically as an IDL Package.
	       The variant rules vary among languages, and for the same language can vary among TLDs.
	       Many languages, including most written in Latin script, do not define
	       equivalent characters, and hence do not have bundles.
	    </t>
	    
	    <t hangText="Preferred variant:">When a Language Variant Table defines sets of
	       equivalent characters, one character in each set is designated as preferred.
	       In a bundle, the variant that consists entirely of preferred characters is the preferred
	       variant.
	       Typically it is the variant that best matches the way that words are written in natural language.
	       Preferred variants are both language and country specific.
	       For example, in some Chinese-speaking
	       countries, the preferred variant is simplified characters, while in others it is traditional characters.
	    </t>
	    
	    <t hangText="Blocking:">When one name in a bundle is registered in a TLD,
	       the rest of the names in the bundle are often blocked, meaning that nobody can register them.
	       In some cases even though the names are blocked from registration by anyone else, the registrant
	       or registry can activate some or all of the otherwise blocked names.
	    </t>
	    
	    <t hangText="Parallel NS:">Multiple names in a bundle are provisioned in the TLD with identical NS records,
	       so they all are handled by the same name servers.
	    </t>
	    
	    <t hangText="DNAME aliasing:">The <xref target="RFC6672">DNAME</xref> DNS record creates a shadow tree of DNS records,
	       roughly as though there were a CNAME in the shadow tree pointing to each name in the target tree.
	       DNAMEs have been used both as second-level names, to provide resolution for several names in a bundle,
	       and as first-level names, to provide resolution for every name under a TLD.
	    </t>

      <section title="Base documents">
	 <t>ICANN has published a variety of documents on variant management.

	    issued in <xref target="G1">Version 1.0</xref> and <xref target="G3">Version 3.0</xref>.
	 </t>
	 <t>TLDs are supposed to register an IDN practices document with IANA for each language in which the TLD
	    accepts IDN registrations, to be entered in <xref target="IANAIDN">an IANA registry</xref>.
	    The practices document lists the Unicode characters allowed in names in the language, which characters
	    are considered equivalent, and which of an equivalent group is preferred.
	    Some TLDs have been more diligent than others at keeping the registry up to date.
	 </t>

	    Some of the <xref target="ICANNAGREE">ICANN agreements with each TLD</xref>

	       No IDN publication mechanism is described in the documentation, but

	       It is probably operating according to <xref target="TWOMEY04A">a 2004 letter

	       Its <xref target="TELPOLICY">policy page</xref> has links to IDN

	    </t>
	    <t>
	       <list style='empty'>
		  <t>
		     Therefore, in addition to the blocking mechanism, bundling is also implemented for the
		     Chinese language IDNs. When registering a Chinese language IDN (primary domain
		     name) up to two additional variant domain names will be automatically registered. The
		     first variant will consist entirely of simplified Chinese characters that correspond to those
		     comprising the primary domain name. The second variant will consist exclusively of
		     traditional Chinese characters that correspond to those comprising the primary domain
		     name.
		  </t>
		  <t>
		     The primary domain name together with the requested variants constitutes a bundle on
		     which all operations are atomic. For example, if the registrant adds a name server to the
		     primary domain name, all names in the bundle will be associated with that new name
		     server.
		  </t>
	       </list>
	    </t>
	    <t>
	       The zone has no DNAME records, so the second paragraph strongly suggests parallel NS.
	    </t>
	    <t>The .TEL TLD, intended as an online directory, does not allow registrants to enter arbitrary
	       RR's in the zone.
	       Nearly all names have NS records pointing to Telnic's own name servers.
	       The A records all point to Telnic's own web server that shows directory information.
	       NAPTR records provide the telephone number of registrants for whom they have one.
	       Users can only directly provision MX records.
	       Except that there are 16 domains, none IDNs, that point to random other name servers and
	       mostly appear to be parked.
