Abstract

   In an attempt to reach consensus on a PCP authentication mechanism,
   this document describes requirements for PCP authentication.  It is
   hoped this can serve as the basis for a comparison of PCP
   authentication mechanisms.

Internet-Draft            PCP Auth Requirements            February 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document derives requirements for PCP Authentication from PCP
   deployment scenarios and scope described in PCP-base
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] and other PCP drafts.  The document focuses on
   requirements and does not make a suggestion on the authentication
   mechanism to be used to satisfy requirements.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements

   REQ-1:  PCP client and server MUST provide client authentication.
      The client could be a host running a PCP client or middle box
      (e.g., NAT) running a PCP Proxy.

      *  The identity details of the client could be used by the PCP
         server to grant access to certain PCP opcodes or PCP options.
         For example GUESTS would not be permitted to use MAP opcode,
         ADMINISTRATOR is only permitted to use THIRD_PARTY option.

      *  The identity details of the client could be used for auditing.

      PCP Authentication MUST also generate message authentication key
      for integrity protection of PCP request and response.

   REQ-2:  PCP Servers MUST be able to indicate that a request will not
      be processed without authentication.

   REQ-3:  PCP allows a server to send multiple responses.  To properly
      support that model with authentication, a client that sends an
      authenticated request MUST be able to verify the integrity and
      origin of an subsequent unsolicited response should it choose to
      do so.

   REQ-4:  PCP allows a server to send multiple responses.  If the
      original request/response exchange was authenticated, a server
      MUST be able to send a subsequent authenticated unsolicited
      Response.

   REQ-5:  PCP allows a server to send multiple responses.  If the
      server wants to send an unsolicited message, but the previous
      security association has expired, the server MUST be able to
      trigger re-authentication with the client.

   REQ-6:  Clients that have authenticated with the server MUST verify
      the integrity of the contents of all unsolicited responses.

   REQ-7:  If there are circumstances where PCP responses do not include
      integrity related to a current security association, then those
      messages MUST NOT be trusted without soliciting an integrity
      protected version.

   REQ-8:  It is important that PCP not leak privacy information between
      the PCP client and the PCP server(s).  Thus, the PCP
      authentication MUST NOT exchange the PCP clients authentication
      credentials in clear text.  For example, exchanging the PCP
      username in clear text would violate this requirement.

   REQ-9:  Confidentiality of the PCP messages is OPTIONAL for PCP
      request and response of opcodes MAP, PEER, ANNOUNCE and options
      THIRD_PARTY, PREFER_FAILURE and FILTER explained in PCP-base
      [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].  Other PCP drafts MUST evaluate if
      confidentiality is OPTIONAL or not for new PCP opcodes and options
      introduced.

   REQ-10:  The authentication mechanism SHOULD be immune to passive
      dictionary attacks.

   REQ-11:  PCP Authentication MUST ensure that an attacker snopping the
      PCP messages cannot guess the SA.

   REQ-12:  To ease troubleshooting and ensure fate sharing, the PCP
      authentication and PCP messages MUST be multiplexed over the same
      port.

   REQ-13:  PCP authentication MUST accommodate authentication between
      administrative domains.  For example, a PCP client may wish to
      communicate directly to an ISP's PCP server, even though the in-
      home CPE router does not support PCP.  In this scenario the PCP
      client needs to directly authenticate with the ISP's PCP server.

   REQ-14:  For the scenarios described in REQ-13, PCP authentication
      mechanism MUST be functional across address and port translation,
      including NAPT64 and NAPT44.

   REQ-15:  If a PCP client and server desire authentication then a PCP
      proxy, that modifies PCP request/response before forwarding
      messages, MUST validate message integrity of PCP messages from the
      PCP server and client respectively.

                                 <- Home side | ISP side ->

   REQ-16:  PCP Proxy must also ensure message integrity after updating
      the PCP message for cases described in sections 6 and 7 of
      [I-D.ietf-pcp-proxy].

   REQ-17:  PCP authentication SHOULD support a mechanism where only one
      PCP client on the host will authenticate with the PCP server and
      any other PCP clients SHOULD be able to reuse the previously
      negotiated key for integrity protection.  For example, multiple
      applications on the host like BitTorrent [BitTorrent],
      WebRTC[I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview]/SIP [RFC3261] using PCP.

   REQ-18:  All else equal, it is RECOMMENDED to choose a widely
      deployed authentication technique with known security properties
      rather than inventing a new authentication mechanism.

   REQ-19:  Changes in PCP to accommodate authentication SHOULD be
      minimal so that updates and additions to the authentication
      mechanism have no bearing on modifying PCP.


4.  Other recommendations

   o  Upon receiving a challenge with a certain REALM, if the PCP client
      does not have credentials for that REALM, it SHOULD attempt to use
      the username GUEST and password GUEST.  The GUEST credentials are
      expected to be configured on infrastructure where PCP
      authentication is not necessary, but such guest users are given
      some (minimal) authorization to use PCP.  This addresses the
      problem when the client is visiting foreign networks like hotel,
      hot spot etc where it may gain access to the network but does not
      know the credentials to authenticate to the ISP's PCP server when
      the in-home CPE router does not support PCP and the PCP client

      needs to directly authenticate with the ISP's PCP server (REQ-14).


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define an architecture nor a protocol; as such
   it does not raise any security concerns.
