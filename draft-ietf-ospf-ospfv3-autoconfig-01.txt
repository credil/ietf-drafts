Abstract

   OSPFv3 is a candidate for deployments in environments where auto-
   configuration is a requirement.  One such environment is the IPv6
   home network where users expect to simply plug in a router and have
   it automatically use OSPFv3 for intra-domain routing.  This document
   describes the necessary mechanisms for OSPFv3 to be self-configuring.

Internet-Draft          OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration             April 2013


1.  Introduction

   OSPFv3 [OSPFV3] is a candidate for deployments in environments where
   auto-configuration is a requirement.  Its operation is largely
   unchanged from the base OSPFv3 protocol specification [OSPFV3].

   The following aspects of OSPFv3 auto-configuration are described:

   1.  Default OSPFv3 Configuration

   2.  HelloInterval/RouterDeadInterval Flexibility

   3.  Unique OSPFv3 Router-ID generation

   4.  OSPFv3 Adjacency Formation

   5.  Duplicate OSPFv3 Router-ID Resolution

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-KEYWORDS].

1.2.  Acknowledgments

   This specification was inspired by the work presented in the Homenet
   working group meeting in October 2011 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
   In particular, we would like to thank Fred Baker, Lorenzo Colitti,
   Ole Troan, Mark Townsley, and Michael Richardson.

   Arthur Dimitrelis and Aidan Williams did prior work in OSPFv3 auto-
   configuration in the expired "Autoconfiguration of routers using a
   link state routing protocol" IETF Draft.  There are many similarities
   between the concepts and techniques in this document.

   Thanks for Abhay Roy and Manav Bhatia for comments regarding
   duplicate router-id processing.

   Thanks for Alvaro Retana and Michael Barnes for comments regarding
   OSPFv3 Instance ID auto-configuration.

   Thanks to Faraz Shamim for review and comments.

   Thanks to Mark Smith for the requirement to reduce the adjacency
   formation delay in the back-to-back ethernet topologies that are
   prevalent in home networks.

2.  OSPFv3 Default Configuration

   For complete auto-configuration, OSPFv3 will need to choose suitable
   configuration defaults.  These include:

   1.  Area 0 Only - All auto-configured OSPFv3 interfaces MUST be in
       area 0.

   2.  OSPFv3 SHOULD be auto-configured on for IPv6 on all interfaces
       intended as general IPv6-capable routers.  Optionally, an
       interface MAY be excluded if it is clear that running OSPFv3 on
       the interface is not required.  For example, if manual
       configuration or another condition indicates that an interface is
       connected to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and there is no
       Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [BGP] peering, there is typically
       no need to employ OSPFv3.  However, note that in many
       environments it can be useful to test whether an OSPFv3 adjacency
       can be established.  In home networking environments, an
       interface where no OSPFv3 neighbors are found but a DHCP IPv6
       prefix can be acquired may be considered as an ISP-facing
       interface and running OSPFv3 is unnecessary.

   3.  OSPFv3 interfaces will be auto-configured to an interface type
       corresponding to their layer-2 capability.  For example, Ethernet
       interfaces will be auto-configured as broadcast networks and
       Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) interfaces will be auto-configured
       as Point-to-Point interfaces.  Most extant OSPFv3 implementations
       do this already.  Auto-configured operation over wireless
       networks required point-to-multipoint (P2MP) and dynamic metrics
       based on wireless feedback is not within the scope of this
       document.  However, auto-configuration is not precluded in these
       environments.

   4.  OSPFv3 interfaces MAY use arbitrary HelloInterval and
       RouterDeadInterval as specified in Section 3.  Of course,
       identical an HelloInterval and RouterDeadInterval will still be
       required to form an adjacency with an OSPFv3 router not
       supporting auto-configuration [OSPFV3].

   5.  All OSPFv3 interfaces SHOULD be auto-configured to use an
       Interface Instance ID of 0 that corresponds to the base IPv6
       unicast address family instance ID as defined in [OSPFV3-AF].
       Similarly, if IPv4 unicast addresses are advertised in a separate
       auto-configured OSPFv3 instance, the base IPv4 unicast address
       family instance ID value, i.e., 64, SHOULD be auto-configured as
       the Interface Instance ID for all interfaces corresponding to the
       OSPFv3 instance [OSPFV3-AF].

3.  OSPFv3 HelloInterval/RouterDeadInterval Flexibility

   Auto-configured OSPFv3 routers will not require identical an
   HelloInterval and RouterDeadInterval to form adjacencies.  Rather,
   the received HelloInterval will be ignored and the received
   RouterDeadInterval will be used to determine OSPFv3 liveliness with
   the sending router.  In other words, the Inactivity Timer for each
   neighbor will reflect that neighbor's advertised RouterDeadInterval
   and MAY be different from other OSPFv3 routers on the link without
   impacting adjacency formation.  A similar mechanism requiring
   additional signaling is being proposed for all OSPFv2 and OSPFv3
   routers [ASYNC-HELLO].

3.1.  Wait Timer Reduction

   In many situations, auto-configured OSPFv3 routers will be deployed
   in environments where back-to-back ethernet connections are utilized.
   When this is the case, an OSPFv3 broadcast interface will not come up
   until the other OSPFv3 router is connected and the routers will wait
   RouterDeadInterval seconds before forming an adjacency [OSPFV2].  In
   order to reduce this delay, an auto-configured OSPFv3 router MAY
   reduce the wait interval to a value no less than (HelloInterval + 1),
   i.e., 11 seconds.  Reducing the setting will slightly increase the
   likelihood of the Designated Router (DR) flapping but is preferable
   to the long adjacency formation delay.  Note that this value is not
   included in OSPFv3 Hello packets and does not impact
   interoperability.

4.  OSPFv3 Router ID Selection

   As OSPFv3 Router implementing this specification must select a unique
   Router ID.  A pseudo-random number SHOULD be used for the OSPFv3
   Router ID.  The generation should be seeded with a variable that is
   likely to be unique in that environment.  A good choice of seed would
   be some portion or hash of the Route-Hardware-Fingerprint as
   described in Section 6.2.2.

   Since there is a possibility of a Router ID collision, duplicate
   Router ID detection and resolution are required as described in
   Section 6 and Section 6.3.

5.  OSPFv3 Adjacency Formation

   Since OSPFv3 uses IPv6 link-local addresses for all protocol messages
   other than messages sent on virtual links (which are not applicable
   to auto-configuration), OSPFv3 adjacency formation can proceed as
   soon as a Router ID has been selected and the IPv6 link-local address
   has completed Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) as specified in IPv6
   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [SLAAC].  Otherwise, the only
   changes to the OSPFv3 base specification are supporting
   HelloInterval/RouterDeadInterval flexibility as described in
   Section 3. and duplicate Router ID detection and resolution as
   described in Section 6 and Section 6.3.

Internet-Draft          OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration             April 2013


6.  OSPFv3 Duplicate Router ID Detection and Resolution

   There are two cases of duplicate OSPFv3 Router ID detection.  One
   where the OSPFv3 router with the duplicate Router ID is directly
   connected and one where it is not.  In both cases, the resolution is
   for one of the routers with the duplicate OSPFv3 Router ID to select
   a new one.

6.1.  Duplicate Router ID Detection for Neighbors

   In this case, a duplicate Router ID is detected if any valid OSPFv3
   packet is received with the same OSPFv3 Router ID but a different
   IPv6 link-local source address.  Once that occurs, the OSPFv3 router
   with the numerically smaller IPv6 link-local address will need to
   select a new Router ID as described in Section 6.3.  Note that the
   fact that the OSPFv3 router is a neighbor on a non-virtual interface
   implies that the router is directly connected.  An OSPFv3 router
   implementing this specification should assure that the inadvertent
   connection of multiple router interfaces to the same physical link is
   not misconstrued as detection of a different OSPFv3 router with a
   duplicate Router ID.

6.2.  Duplicate Router ID Detection for OSPFv3 Routers that are not
      Neighbors

   OSPFv3 Routers implementing auto-configuration, as specified herein,
   MUST originate an Auto-Config (AC) Link State Advertisement (LSA)
   including the Router-Hardware-Fingerprint Type-Length-Value (TLV).
   The Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV contains a variable length value
   that has a very high probability of uniquely identifying the
   advertising OSPFv3 router.  An OSPFv3 router implementing this
   specification MUST compare a received self-originated Auto-Config
   LSA's Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV against its own router hardware
   fingerprint.  If the fingerprints are not equal, there is a Router ID
   conflict and the OSPFv3 Router with the numerically smaller router
   hardware fingerprint MUST select a new Router ID as described in
   Section 6.3.

   This new LSA is designated for information related to OSPFv3 Auto-
   configuration and, in the future, could be used other auto-
   configuration information, e.g., global IPv6 prefixes.  However, this
   is beyond the scope of this document.

6.2.1.  OSPFv3 Router Auto-Configuration LSA

   The OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration (AC) LSA has a function code of TBD and
   the S2/S1 bits set to 01 indicating Area Flooding Scope.  The U bit
   will be set indicating that the OSPFv3 AC LSA should be flooded even

   if it is not understood.  The Link State ID (LSID) value will be a
   integer index used to discriminate between multiple AC LSAs
   originated by the same OSPFv3 Router.  This specification only
   describes the contents of an AC LSA with a Link State ID (LSID) of 0.

                    OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration (AC) LSA

   The format of the TLVs within the body of an AC LSA is the same as
   the format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF [TE].
   The LSA payload consists of one or more nested Type/Length/Value
   (TLV) triplets.  The format of each TLV is:


       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                                TLV Format

   The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets
   (thus a TLV with no value portion would have a length of 0).  The TLV
   is padded to 4-octet alignment; padding is not included in the length

   field (so a 3-octet value would have a length of 3, but the total
   size of the TLV would be 8 octets).  Nested TLVs are also 32-bit
   aligned.  For example, a 1-byte value would have the length field set
   to 1, and 3 octets of padding would be added to the end of the value
   portion of the TLV.  Unrecognized types are ignored.

   The new LSA is designated for information related to OSPFv3 Auto-
   configuration and, in the future, can be used other auto-
   configuration information, e.g., global IPv6 prefixes.

6.2.2.  Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV

   The Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV is the first TLV defined for the
   OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration (AC) LSA.  It will have type 1 and MUST be
   advertised in the LSID OSPFv3 AC LSA with an LSID of 0.  It SHOULD
   occur, at most, once and the first instance of the TLV will take
   precedence over subsequent TLV instances.  The length of the Router-
   Hardware-Fingerprint is variable but must be 32 bytes or greater.

   The contents of the hardware fingerprint should be some combination
   of MAC addresses, CPU ID, or serial number(s) that provides an
   extremely high probability of uniqueness.  It MUST be based on
   hardware attributes that will not change across hard and soft
   restarts.

6.3.  Duplicate Router ID Resolution

   The OSPFv3 Router selected to resolve the duplicate OSPFv3 Router ID
   condition must select a new OSPFv3 Router ID.  After selecting a new
   Router ID, the Router-LSA with the prior duplicate Router ID MUST be
   purged.  All self-originated LSAs MUST be reoriginated, and any

Internet-Draft          OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration             April 2013


   OSPFv3 neighbor adjacencies MUST be reestablished.

6.4.  Change to Received Self-Originated LSA Processing

   RFC 2328 [OSPFV2], Section 13.4, describes the processing of received
   self-originated LSAs.  If the received LSA doesn't exist, the
   receiving router will purge it from the OSPF routing domain.  If the
   LSA is newer than the version in the Link State Database (LSDB), the
   receiving router will originate a newer version by advancing the LSA
   sequence number and reflooding.  Since it is possible for an auto-
   configured OSPFv3 router to choose a duplicate OSPFv3 Router ID,
   OSPFv3 routers implementing this specification should detect when
   multiple instances of the same self-originated LSA are purged or
   reoriginated since this is indicative of an OSPFv3 router with a
   duplicate Router ID in the OSPFv3 routing domain.  When this
   condition is detected, the OSPFv3 Router SHOULD delay self-originated
   LSA processing for LSAs that have recently been purged or reflooded.
   This specification recommends 10 seconds as the interval defining
   recent self-originated LSA processing and an exponential back off of
   1 to 8 seconds for the processing delay.

7.  Security Considerations

   A unique OSPFv3 Interface Instance ID is used for auto-configuration
   to prevent inadvertent OSPFv3 adjacency formation, see Section 2

   The goals of security and complete OSPFv3 auto-configuration are
   somewhat contradictory.  When no explicit security configuration
   takes place, auto-configuration implies that additional devices
   placed in the network are automatically adopted as a part of the
   network.  However, auto-configuration can also be combined with
   password configuration (see below) or future extensions for automatic
   pairing between devices.  These mechanisms can help provide an
   automatically configured, securely routed network.

   It is RECOMMENDED that OSPFv3 routers supporting this specification
   also offer an option to explicitly configure a password for HMAC-SHA
   authentication as described in [OSPFV3-AUTH-TRAILER].  When
   configured, the password will be used on all auto-configured
   interfaces with the Security Association Identifier (SA ID) set to 1
   and HMAC-SHA-256 used as the authentication algorithm.

8.  Management Considerations

   It is RECOMMENDED that OSPFv3 routers supporting this specification
   also allow explicit configuration of OSPFv3 parameters as specified
   in Appendix C of [OSPFV3].  This is in addition to the authentication
   key configuration recommended in Section 7.  However, it is
   acknowledged that there may be some deployment scenarios where manual
   authentication key configuration is not required.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This specification allocates a new OSPFv3 LSA, OSPFv3 Auto-
   Configuration (AC) LSA, TBD, as described in Section 6.2.1.

   This specification also creates a registry for OSPFv3 Auto-
   Configuration (AC) LSA TLVs.  This registry should be placed in the
   existing OSPFv3 IANA registry, and new values can be allocated via
   IETF Consensus or IESG Approval.

   Three initial values are allocated:

   o  0 is marked as reserved.

   o  1 is Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV (Section 6.2.2).

   o  65535 is an Auto-configuration-Experiment-TLV, a common value that
      can be used for experimental purposes.
