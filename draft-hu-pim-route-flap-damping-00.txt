Internet-Draft           PIM Route Flap Damping                 Oct 2011


1.  Introduction

   The instability of downstream routers, which may include the frequent
   change of, for instance the unicast routing, the physical state of
   multicast interfaces etc., will trigger an excessive number of Join/
   Prune messages sent upwards to the routing peers where an extra
   amount of updates of routing state are made.  This is referred to
   herein as "route flap".

   This document specifies the damping functions to reduce the
   processing load caused by route flaps on the upstream routers.  The
   damping functions are categorized according to route flaps resulting
   from different types of Join/Prune messages received.  In addition,
   it should be noted that the original operations and state machines of
   the PIM protocol are preserved when the design of these damping
   functions is implemented.


2.  Parameters Definition

   Flap count: It is used to count the times of PIM multicast route item
   flapping.

   Damping threshold: This value is expressed as a number of PIM
   multicast route withdrawals.  It is above which a PIM multicast route
   will be suppressed.

   Damping reuse threshold: This value is expressed as a number of PIM
   multicast route withdrawals.  It is below which a suppressed item
   will now be used again.

   Half life timer: It is a cycle timer.  When half life timer is
   expired, the flap count will be reduced by half if it is bigger than
   1.  If the flap count is 1, it is reduced to 0.  The half life timer
   is used in the NoDamping and Damping state.

   Maximum hold timer: This value is the maximum time a suppressed PIM
   multicast route item should be reuse no matter how unstable it has
   been prior to this period of stability.


3.  PIM Join/Prune message Damping

3.1.  (*,*, RP)Join/Prune Message Damping

   The (*,*, RP) Damping state is shown in figure 1, there are three
   states:

   Transitions from Idle state
      When the (*, *, RP) damping state machine is in Idle state, the
      following events may trigger transitions:

         E1:The damping function is enabled in this router.  The (*, *,
         RP)damping state machine enters into NoDamping state

   Transitions from NoDamping State
      When the (*, *, RP) damping state machine is in NoDamping state,
      the following events may trigger transitions:

         E3: The flap count is used to count the changes of (*, *, RP)
         route.  If the (*, *, RP)item is in Join state and the new
         Join/Prune message received indicates that the route should be
         pruned, the flap count should record the change, and vice
         versa, if the (*, *, RP) route is in delete state and new Join/
         Prune message received indicates that the route should be
         created, the flap count also records it.  If the flap count is
         above the damping threshold, event E3 is triggered, the state
         machine enters into damping state.

   Transitions from NoDamping State
      When the (*, *, RP) damping state machine is in damping state, the
      following events may trigger transitions:

         E2: The damping function is disabled in this router.  The (*,
         *, RP) damping state machine enters into Idle state.

         E4: The flap count is below the damping reuse threshold, the
         item in damping list is reused, and the (*, *, RP) damping
         route state machine enters into NoDamping state.

         E5: The maximum hold timer is expired.  The PIM (*, *, RP)
         route item in Damping state is reused no matter how unstable it
         has been prior to this period of stability.  The (*, *, RP)
         damping route state machine enters into NoDamping state.

   (*,*, RP) damping state machine actions:

      Action A1: The damping function is enabled in the router.  The
      router is ready to record the times of (*,*, RP) route state
      changed.  If the PIM Join/Prune message is received and a new
      (*,*, RP) item is required to create, the (*,*, RP) item is added
      to damping pending list if there is no item for that (*,*, RP) and
      the state is Join, and the flap count should plus one.  If the PIM
      Join/Prune message is received and a (*,*, RP) item is required to
      prune from the (*,*, RP) table, the (*,*, RP) item is added to
      damping pending list if there is no item for that (*,*, RP) and
      the state is Prune, and the flap count should plus one.  The half
      life timer is started when the (*,*, RP) item is added to the
      damping pending list.

      The cycle half life timer is running when the damping pending (*,
      *, RP) is in NoDamping state.  If half life timer is expired, the
      flap count is reduced by half.

      If the flap count is reduced to zero, (*, *, RP) route should be
      recovery based on the state in the damping list.  If the state of
      (*, *, RP) in the damping pending list is Join, the (*, *, RP)
      route will be added to the multicast routing table.  If the
      damping (*, *, RP) route state in damping list is prune, the (*,
      *, RP) route will be deleted from the multicast routing table if
      the (*, *, RP) route is existed in.  The damping pending (*, *,
      RP) is deleted from the damping pending list.

      Action A2: The damping function is disabled in the router.  The
      state machine enters Idle state.  The half life timer is stopping
      if it runs.  The flap count is reset and stop counting the times
      of (*,*, RP) route state change.

      Action A3: The PIM (*,*, RP) route state is suppressed and moved
      from the damping pending list to damping list, and the cycle half
      life timer for that (*,*,RP) route is started.  The maximum
      holding timer is started if it doesn't run.

      Action A4: The suppressed item is reused again.  If the damping
      (*,*, RP) route state in damping list is join, the (*,*, RP) route
      will be added to the multicast routing table.  If the damping
      (*,*, RP) route state in damping list is prune, the (*,*, RP)
      route will be deleted from the multicast routing table if the
      (*,*, RP) route is existed in.  The damping (*,*, RP) route is
      deleted from the damping list.  The flap count is reset and stop
      counting the times of (*, *, RP) damping route state change.  The
      cycle half life timer and maximum hold timer are stopped.

      Action A5: The maximum hold timer is expired.  The (*,*, RP) route
      state item in Damping state is reused.  If the damping (*,*, RP)
      route state in damping list is join, the (*,*, RP) route will be
      added to the multicast routing table.  If the damping (*,*, RP)
      route state in damping list is prune, the (*,*, RP) route will be
      deleted from the multicast routing table if the (*,*, RP) route is
      existed in.  The reuse timer and maximum hold timer are stopped if
      they run.  The damping (*,*, RP) route is deleted from the damping
      list.  The flap count is reset and stop counting the times of (*,
      *, RP) damping route state changed.  The cycle half life timer and
      maximum hold timer are stopped.

3.2.  (*, G) Join/Prune Message Damping

   The (*, G) Damping state is shown in figure 2, there are three
   states:

   Idle
      The damping function isn't enabled yet in this router

   Damping
      The (*, G) state is damped in this router.  The (*, G) damping
      route is in damping list.

   NoDamping
      The (*, G) state is not damped in this router.  The (*, G) damping
      route is in damping pending list.

   The following events can change the (*, G) Join/Prune message damping
   state:

      E1: damping function is enabled in the router.

      E2: damping disable is disabled in the router.

      E3: The flap count is above the damping threshold.

         above the damping threshold, event E3 is triggered, the state
         machine enters into damping state.

   Transitions from NoDamping State
      When the (*, G) damping state machine is in damping state, the
      following events may trigger transitions:

         E2: The damping function is disabled in this router.  The (*,
         G) damping state machine enters into Idle state.

         E4: The flap count is below the damping reuse threshold, the
         item in damping list is reused, and the (*, G) damping route
         state machine enters into NoDamping state.

         E5: The maximum hold timer is expired.  The PIM (*, G) route
         item in Damping state is reused no matter how unstable it has
         been prior to this period of stability.  The (*,G)damping route
         state machine enters into NoDamping state.

   (*, G) damping state machine actions:

      Action A1: The damping function is enabled in the router.  The
      router is ready to record the times of (*, G) route state change.
      If the PIM Join/Prune message is received and a new (*, G) item is
      required to create, the (*, G) item is added to damping pending
      list if there is no item for that (*, G) and the state is Join,
      and the flap count should record the change.  If the PIM Join/
      Prune message is received and a (*, G) item is required to prune
      from the (*, G) table, the (*, G) item is added to damping pending
      list if there is no item for that (*, G) and the state is Prune,
      and the flap count should record the change.  The cycle half life
      timer is started when the (*, G) item is added to the damping
      pending list.

      The cycle half life timer is running when the (*, G) is in
      NoDamping state.  If half life timer is expired, the flap count is
      reduced by half.

      If flap count is reduced to zero, (*, G) route should be recovery
      based on the state in the damping list.  If the state of (*, G) in
      the damping pending list is Join, the (*, G) route will be added
      to the multicast routing table.  If the damping (*, G) route state
      in damping list is prune, the (*, G) route will be deleted from
      the multicast routing table if the (*, G) route is existed in.
      The damping pending (*, G) is deleted from the damping pending
      list.

      Action A2: The damping function is disabled in the router.  The
      state machine enters Idle state.  The half life timer is stopping
      if it runs.  The flap count is reset and stop counting the times
      of (*, G) route state flapping.

      Action A3: The PIM (*, G) route state is suppressed and moved from
      the damping pending list to damping list, and the cycle half life
      timer for that (*,G) route is started.  The maximum holding timer
      is started if it doesn't run.

      Action A4: The suppressed item is reused again.  If the damping
      (*, G) route state in damping list is join, the (*, G) route will
      be added to the multicast routing table.  If the damping (*, G)
      route state in damping list is prune, the (*, G) route will be
      deleted from the multicast routing table if the (*, G) route is
      existed in.  The damping (*, G) route is deleted from the damping
      list.  The flap count is reset and stop counting the times of (*,
      G) damping route state changed.  The cycle half life timer and
      maximum hold timer are stopped.

      Action A5: The maximum hold timer is expired.  The (*, G) route
      state item in damping state is reused.  If the damping (*, G)
      route state in damping list is join, the (*, G) route will be
      added to the multicast routing table.  If the damping (*, G) route
      state in damping list is prune, the (*, G) route will be deleted
      from the multicast routing table if the (*, G) route is existed
      in.  The reuse timer and maximum hold timer are stopped if they
      run.  The (*, G) damping route is deleted from the damping list.
      The flap count is reset and stop counting the times of (*, G)

      Join/Prune message is received and a (S,G,RPT) item is required to
      prune from the (S,G,RPT) table, the (S,G,RPT) item is added to
      damping pending list if there is no item for that (S,G,RPT) and
      the state is Prune, and the flap count should plus one.  The half
      life timer is started when the (S, G, RPT) item is added to the
      damping pending list.

      The cycle half life timer is running when the damping pending (S,
      G, RPT) is in NoDamping state.  If half life timer is expired, the
      flap count is reduced by half.

Internet-Draft           PIM Route Flap Damping                 Oct 2011


      If flap count is reduced to zero, (S, G, RPT) route should be
      recovery based on the state in the damping list.  If the state of
      (S, G, RPT) in the damping pending list is Join, the (S, G, RPT)
      route will be added to the multicast routing table.  If the
      damping (S, G, RPT) route state in damping list is prune, the (S,
      G, RPT) route will be deleted from the multicast routing table if
      the (S, G, RPT) route is existed in.  The damping pending (S, G,
      RPT) is deleted from the damping pending list.

      Action A2: The damping function is disabled in the router.  The
      state machine enters Idle state.  The half life timer is stopping
      if it runs.  The flap count is reset and stop counting the times
      of (S, G, RPT) route state change.

      Action A3: The PIM (S,G,RPT) route state is suppressed and moved
      from the damping pending list to damping list, and the cycle half
      life timer for that (S,G, RPT) route is started.  The maximum
      holding timer is started if it doesn't run.

      Action A4: The suppressed item is reused again.  If the damping
      (S, G, RPT) route state in damping list is join, the (S, G, RPT)
      route will be added to the multicast routing table.  If the
      damping (S, G, RPT) route state in damping list is prune, the (S,
      G, RPT) route will be deleted from the multicast routing table if
      the (S, G, RPT) route is existed in.  The damping (S, G, RPT)
      route is deleted from the damping list.  The flap count is reset
      and stop counting the times of (S, G, RPT) damping route state
      flapping.  The cycle half life timer and maximum hold timer are
      stopped.

      Action A5: The maximum hold timer is expired.  The (S, G, RPT)
      route state item in Damping state is reused.  If the damping (S,
      G, RPT) route state in damping list is join, the (S, G, RPT) route
      will be added to the multicast routing table.  If the damping (S,
      G, RPT) route state in damping list is prune, the (S, G, RPT)
      route will be deleted from the multicast routing table if the (S,
      G, RPT) route is existed in.  There reuse timer and maximum hold
      timer are stopped if they run.  The damping(S, G, RPT) route is
      deleted from the damping list.  The flap count is reset and stop
      counting the times of (S, G, RPT) damping route state flapping.
      The cycle half life timer and maximum hold timer are stopped.
