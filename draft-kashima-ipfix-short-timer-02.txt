Internet-Draft      Short Timer Information Elements            Sep 2011


1.  Introduction

   The IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102] defines an extensible list of
   Information Elements which may be transmitted by the IPFIX protocol
   [RFC5102].

   This document lists a series of new Information Elements to update
   the IPFIX Information Model, and acts as the persistent publication
   medium requested in the IANA considerations section of the IPFIX
   Information Model [RFC5102] ("The specification of new IPFIX
   Information Elements MUST use the template specified in section 2.1
   and MUST be published using a well established and persistent
   publication medium").


2.  Terminology

   IPFIX-specific terminology used in this document is defined in
   section 2 of the IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101].  As in the IPFIX Protocol
   [RFC5101], these IPFIX-specific terms have the first letter of a word
   capitalized when used in this document.

2.1.  IPFIX Documents Overview

   The IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101] provides network administrators with
   access to IP flow information.

   The architecture for the export of measured IP flow information out
   of an IPFIX exporting process to a collecting process is defined in
   the IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470], per the requirements defined in RFC
   3917 [RFC3917].

   The IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470] specifies how IPFIX Data Records and
   Templates are carried via a congestion-aware transport protocol from
   IPFIX Exporting Processes to IPFIX Collecting Processes.

   IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX Information Elements, their
   name, type and additional semantic information, as specified in the
   IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102].

   Finally the IPFIX Applicability Statement [RFC5472] describes what
   type of applications can use the IPFIX protocol and how they can use
   the information provided.  It furthermore shows how the IPFIX
   framework relates to other architectures and frameworks.

2.2.  PSAMP Documents Overview

   The document "A Framework for Packet Selection and Reporting"
   [RFC5474], describes the PSAMP framework for network elements to
   selectsubsets of packets by statistical and other methods, and to
   export a stream of reports on the selected packets to a collector.

   The set of packet selection techniques (sampling, filtering, and
   hashing) supported by PSAMP are described in "Sampling and Filtering
   Techniques for IP Packet Selection" [RFC5475].

   The PSAMP protocol [RFC5476] specifies the export of packet
   information from a PSAMP Exporting Process to a PSAMP Collecting
   Process.  Like IPFIX, PSAMP has a formal description of its
   information elements, their name, type and additional semantic
   information.  The PSAMP information model is defined in [RFC5477].

   Finally [I-D.ietf-ipfix-psamp-mib] describes the PSAMP Management
   Information Base.


3.  Existing Information Elements

   The following are existing Information Elements related to time stamp
   and time duration.  Becasue one application of IPFIX is QoS (Quality
   of service) monitoring, almost all of them supports units smaller
   than seconds.  For example, we can use observationTimeMilliseconds
   for delay measurements.  On the other hand, Information Elements
   related to flow timer does not support units smaller than seconds,
   but support only unit second.

4.  New Information Elements

   According to a diversification of multimedia application and an
   aggregation of server in data center, we are facing to measure bursty
   traffic that causes packets loss and delay jitter.  In order to
   measure bursty traffic with IPFIX/PSAMP, flow timers which are
   shorter than one second are required.

   The following Information Elements are necessary for enabling the
   IPFIX/PSAMP traffic measurment of volume change in a short time.

   | ID   | Name                          | Units        |
   +------+-------------------------------+--------------+
   | TBD1 | flowActiveTimeoutMilliseconds | milliseconds |
   | TBD2 | flowIdleTimeoutMilliseconds   | milliseconds |
   +------+-------------------------------+--------------+

4.1.  flowActiveTimeoutMilliseconds

   Description:

      The number of milliseconds after which an active Flow is timed out
      anyway, even if there is still a continuous flow of packets.

   Abstract Data Type: unsigned16

   ElementId: TDB1

   Status: current

   Units: milliseconds

4.2.  flowIdleTimeoutMilliseconds

   Description:

      A Flow is considered to be timed out if no packets belonging to
      the Flow have been observed for the number of milliseconds
      specified by this field.

   Abstract Data Type: unsigned16

   ElementId: TDB2

   Status: current

   Units: milliseconds


5.  Security Considerations

   The recommendations in this document do not introduce any additional
   security issues to those already mentioned in [RFC5101] and
   [RFC5477].


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires an ElementId assignment to be made by IANA.
