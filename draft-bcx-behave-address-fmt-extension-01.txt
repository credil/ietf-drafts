            Extended IPv6 Addressing for Encoding Port Range
               draft-bcx-behave-address-fmt-extension-01

Abstract

   This document discusses an extension of the algorithmic translation
   between IPv4 and IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.  The extended
   address format contains transport-layer port set identification
   (PSID) which allows several IPv6 nodes to share a single IPv4 address
   with each node managing a different range of ports.  This address
   format extension can be used for IPv4/IPv6 translation, as well as
   IPv4 over IPv6 tunneling.

Internet-Draft          Extended IPv6 Addressing            October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document discusses an extension of the address format defined in
   [RFC6052].  In Section 2.2, the IPv4-embedded IPv6 address format is
   defined which composed of a variable length prefix, the embedded IPv4
   address, and a variable length suffix, as presented in the following
   diagram, in which PL designates the prefix length:

    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |PL| 0-------------32--40--48--56--64--72--80--88--96--104-112-120-|
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |32|     prefix    |v4(32)         | u | suffix                    |
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |40|     prefix        |v4(24)     | u |(8)| suffix                |
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |48|     prefix            |v4(16) | u | (16)  | suffix            |
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |56|     prefix                |(8)| u |  v4(24)   | suffix        |
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |64|     prefix                    | u |   v4(32)      | suffix    |
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |96|     prefix                                    |    v4(32)     |
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                         Figure 1: Address Format

   In [RFC6052] Section 3.5, it states:

      "There have been proposals to complement stateless translation
      with a port-range feature.  Instead of mapping an IPv4 address to
      exactly one IPv6 prefix, the options would allow several IPv6
      nodes to share an IPv4 address, with each node managing a
      different range of ports.  If a port range extension is needed, it
      could be defined later, using bits currently reserved as null in
      the suffix."

   This document defines such a suffix encoding scheme and the
   corresponding port mapping algorithm.

1.1.  Applicability Scope

   The address format extension presented in this document is used for
   IPv4/IPv6 stateless translation and dual IPv4/IPv6 stateless
   translation without prefix delegation [I-D.bcx-address-fmt-extension]
   [I-D.xli-behave-divi].  The address format used for dual IPv4/IPv6
   stateless translation with prefix delegation [I-D.xli-behave-divi-pd]
   and encapsulation should refer to
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Port Mapping Algorithm

2.1.  Mathematical representation of the Algorithm

   There exist many port mapping algorithms and each one may have
   advantages and disadvantages, as well as has its best application
   scenario.  Since different PSID MUST have non-overlapped port range,
   the two extreme cases are: (1) the port number is not continue for
   each PSID, but uniformly distributed cross the whole port range
   (0-65535); (2) the port number is continue in a single range for each
   PSID.  The port mapping algorithm proposed here is called generalized
   modulus algorithm and it is flexible, meets these two cases and
   simple.

   For given sharing ratio (R) and the maximum number of continue ports
   (M), the generalized modulus algorithm is defined as

   1.  The port number (P) of a given PSID (K) is composed of

       P = R*M*j + M*K + i

       Where
       o PSID: K=0 to R-1
       o Port range index: j = (1024/M)/R to ((65536/M)/R)-1, if the
       well-known port numbers (0-1023) are excluded.
       o Port continue index: i=0 to M-1

   2.  The PSID (K) of a given port number (P) is determined by

       K = (floor(P/M)) % R

       Where
       o % is modular operator
       o floor(arg) is a function returns the largest integer not
       greater than arg

   3.  The well-known port number (0-1023) can be used, if additional
       port mapping rule is defined.

2.2.  Bit Representation of the Algorithm

   Given sharing ratio (R=2^k), the maximum number of continue ports
   (M=2^m), for any PSID (K) available ports (P) can be represented as:

          0                          8                         15
          +---------------+----------+------+-------------------+
          |                     P                               |
          ----------------+-----------------+-------------------+
          |        A (j)  |   PSID (K)      |        M  (i)     |
          +---------------+----------+------+-------------------+
          |<----a bits--->|<-----k bits---->|<------m bits----->|
                          |<---c bits--->|<-----(k+m-c) bits--->|

                       Figure 2: Bit representation

   Where j and i are the same indexes defined in the port mapping
   algorithm.

   For any port number, the PSID can be obtained by bit mask operation
   and therefore the generalized modulus algorithm does not introduce
   the computational complexity.

   Note that in above figure there is a PSID prefix length (c).  Based
   on this definition, PSID is also in CIDR style and more ports can be
   assigned to a single CE when PSID prefix length (c < k).

   When m=0, the generalized modulus algorithm becomes modulus
   operation.  When a=0, the generalized modulus algorithm becomes
   division operation.

2.3.2.  PSID with variable prefix length

   For example, different PSIDs have different prefix length (c)

          Host        |     PSID prefix       |   Number of ports

          Host1       |     010/3             |   1x8192
          Host2       |     011/3             |   1x8192
          Host3       |     100/1             |   4x8192
          -------------------------------------------------------

                            Figure 4: Example 2

2.4.  Features of the Algorithm

   The generalized modulus operation has the following features:

   1.  There is no waste of the port number, except the well-known
       ports.

   2.  The algorithm is flexible, the control parameters are sharing
       ratio (R), the continue port range (M) and PSID prefix length
       (c).

   3.  It does not introduce algorithm complexity.

   4.  It allows service providers to define their own address sharing
       ratio, the theoretical value is from 1:1 to 1:65536 and a more
       practical value is from 1:1 to 1:4096.

   5.  It supports deployments using differentiated port ranges.

   6.  It supports differentiated port ranges within a single shared
       IPv4 address.

   7.  It support excluding the well known ports 0-1023.

   8.  It supports assigning well known ports to a CE.

   9.  It supports legacy RTP/RTCP compatibility.

3.1.  Address Format

   Based on the port mapping algorithm, the extended address format is
   shown in the following figure.

    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |PL| 0-------------32--40--48--56--64--72--80--88--96--104-112-120-|
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |32|     prefix    |v4(32)         | u | PSID  | 0             | Q |
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |40|     prefix        |v4(24)     | u |(8)| PSID | 0          | Q |
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |48|     prefix            |v4(16) | u | (16)  | PSID | 0      | Q |
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |56|     prefix                |(8)| u |  v4(24)   | PSID | 0  | Q |
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |64|     prefix                    | u |   v4(32)      |PSID |0| Q |
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                         Figure 5: Address Format

   Where PL designates the prefix length.

   The PSID is placed right after the IPv4 address, since the
   combination of the IPv4 address and the PSID represents the more
   specifics in CIDR style which is sharing an IPv4 address with others.

   The PSID prefix length (Q=c) is encoded in the last octet (bits 120-
   127) to indicate the number of ports can be used.  When Q=0, the
   extended address format will become the address format defined in
   [RFC6052].  The relations between Q, the sharing ratio (R), the
   maximum continue port range (M) and the number of ports can be shown
   in the following figure.

                  8    1:256          256        256

                 10    1:1,024         64         64
                 11    1:2,048         32         32
                 12    1:4,096         16         16
                 ------------------------------------------

                           Figure 6: Port range

   Since newly defined IPv6 addresses with suffix are more specifics
   compared with the original address format defined in [RFC6052], the
   routing considerations in that document are also applied here.
   Furthermore, the port range is embedded in the extended IPv4-
   translatable IPv6 addresses and bound to the PSID therefore the
   packets containing extended IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses as the
   destination can be routed to different IPv6 nodes.

3.2.  Considerations of Using a Shorter Prefix length

   Since IPv4 address plus variable length PSID represents the more
   specifics, the prefix length (PL) defined in [RFC6052] can be
   shorter.  In these cases, the interface identifier (IID: second 64
   bits) will not contains PSID and therefore can be used for regular
   prefix delegation, as shown in the following figure.

   However, there will be a waste of the IPv6 address space in order to
   represent the IPv4-converted addresses.


4.  DHCP Options Extensions

   Based on the address format and the port mapping algorithm defined in
   this document, the IPv6 host needs to get the corresponding
   parameters via DHCPv6 [RFC3315][RFC3633] or others signaling scheme.
   These parameters are:

   1.  The IPv6 prefix

   2.  The IPv6 prefix length

   3.  The IPv4 prefix

   4.  The IPv4 prefix length

   5.  The sharing ratio (R)

   6.  The maximum number of continue ports (M)

   7.  The PSID (K)

   8.  The PSID length (c)


5.  Comparisons with MAP

   There are common parts and differences between this document and the
   address format defined in
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].

   1.  The address format extension (AFT) defined in this document is
       used for single and dual stateless translation without prefix
       delegation, while MAP is used for encapsulation and dual
       stateless translation with prefix delegation.

   2.  The AFT uses same IPv6 prefix for the source address from a CE to
       any destination (IPv4-translatable address) and the destination
       address from a CE to the outside IPv4 Internet (IPv4-converted
       address), while MAP uses different IPv6 prefixes, due to the
       requirements of prefix delegation.

   3.  The AFT uses same IPv6 prefix for all CEs, so there is no need to
       define prefix encoding scheme (e.g.  CE index), while MAP defines
       the prefix encoding scheme, due to the requirements of prefix
       delegation.

   4.  Due to the nature of using same IPv6 prefix for both IPv4-
       translatable address and IPv4-converted address, there is no
       referral problem and mesh scenarios can be supported without
       additional mapping rules, while MAP does require additional
       mapping rule for supporting mesh scenario.

   5.  The AFT and MAP share the same suffix coding scheme (IPv4 address
       + PSID).

   6.  The AFT and MAP share the same port mapping algorithm
       (generalized modulus algorithm).


6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo adds no new IANA considerations.


7.  Security Considerations

   There is no special security consideration.
