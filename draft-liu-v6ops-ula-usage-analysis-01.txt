1. Introduction

   Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) are defined in RFC 4193 [RFC4193] as
   provider-independent prefixes that can be used on isolated networks,
   internal networks, and VPNs. Although ULAs may be treated like global
   scope by applications, normally they are not used on the publicly
   routable internet.

   However, the ULAs haven't been widely used since IPv6 hasn't been
   widely deployed yet.

   The use of ULA addresses in various types of networks has been confused
   for network operators. Some network operators believe ULAs are not
   useful at all while other network operators run their entire networks on
   ULA address space. This document attempts to clarify the advantages and
   disadvantages of ULAs and how they can be most appropriately used.

   (Editor's note: This draft welcomes any existing practice of
   deploying ULA to be discussed.)

2. The features of ULA

2.1. Globally unique

   ULA is intended to be globally unique to avoid collision. Since the
   hosts assigned with ULA may occasionally be merged into one network,


Liu, et al.          Expires September 12, 2012               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft      draft-liu-v6ops-ula-analysis            March 2012


   this uniqueness is necessary. The prefix uniqueness is based on
   randomization of 40 bits and is considered random enough to ensure a
   high degree of uniqueness and make merging of networks simple and
   without the need to renumbering overlapping IP address space.
   Overlapping is cited as a deficiency with how [RFC1918] addresses were
   deployed, and ULA was designed to overcome this deficiency.

   Notice that, as described in [RFC4864], in practice, applications may
   treat ULAs like global-scope addresses, but address selection
   algorithms may need to distinguish between ULAs and ordinary global-
   scope unicast addresses to ensure bidirectional communications.

2.2. Independent address space

   ULA provides an internal address independence capability  in IPv6 that
   is similar to how  RFC 1918 is commonly used. ULA allows
   administrators to configure the internal network of each platform the
   same way it is configured in IPv4. Many organizations have security
   policies and architectures based around the local-only routing of
   RFC1918 addresses and those policies may directly map to ULA. ULA can
   be used for internal communications without having any permanent or
   only intermittent Internet connectivity. And it needs no registration
   so that it can support on-demand usage and does not carry any RIR
   documentation burden or disclosures.



2.3. Well known prefix

   The prefixes of ULAs are well known and they are easy to be
   identified and easy to be filtered.

   This feature may be convenient to management of security policies and
   troubleshooting. For example, the administrators can decide what
   parameters have to be assembled or transmitted globally, by a
   separate function, through an appropriate gateway/firewall, to the
   Internet or to the telecom network.

3. ULA usage analysis

   In this section, we try to cover plausible possible ULA use case.
   Some of them have been discussed in other documents which are briefly
   reviewed as well as other potential valid usage is discussed.

Internet-Draft      draft-liu-v6ops-ula-analysis            March 2012


3.1. ULA-only deployment

   This section talks about use cases that hosts in a network are only
   assigned with ULAs.

   IP is used ubiquitously. Some situations like RS-485, or other type
   of industrial control bus, or even non-networked digital interface
   like MIL-STD-1397 began to use IP protocol.

   If one is in a network that does not have service from someone that
   will allocate it a prefix and wants to either use addresses that are
   not link-local or addresses that will allow for routing, a ULA
   provides a way to generate a prefix for the purpose.

   - Isolated network

   In some situations, the network is isolated or it has not been
   connected to the outside yet. ULA is a straightforward way to assign
   the IP addresses in the network with minimal administrative cost or
   burden.

   ULA is a good solution for networks that are explicitly designed to
   not connect to the internet. These networks may include machine-to-
   machine, sensor networks, or other types of SCADA networks which may
   include very large numbers of addresses and explicitly prohibited from
   connect to the global internet (electricity meters...). Just like many
   implementation of RFC1918 address space, the ULA address space is one
   layer of a multilayer security design.

   - Connected network

   In some situations, hosts/interfaces are assigned with ULA-only, but
   the networks need to communicate with the outside. The use case may
   include the following two models.

   o  Using NAT

   With some a kind of NAT which provides a simple one to one mapping
   for a subset of the internal addresses could fit the requirement.

   Generally, this draft doesn't consider the ULA+NAT a good model of
   IPv6 deployment in normal cases. When thinking about ULA, we should
   eliminate the misunderstanding that ULA means the IPv6 version of
   rfc1918 deployment model.

   But this draft doesn't intend to deny the requirement of ULA+NAT for
   some special cases. In some very constrained situations(for example,


Liu, et al.          Expires September 12, 2012               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      draft-liu-v6ops-ula-analysis            March 2012


   in the sensors), the network needs ULA as the on-demand and stable
   addressing which doesn't need much code to support address assignment
   mechanisms like DHCP or ND. And the network also needs to connect to
   the outside, then there can be a gateway to be the NAT which may not
   be so sensitive to the constrained resource. This behavior could
   refer NPTv6 [RFC6296].

   o  Using application-layer proxies

   The proxies terminate the network-layer connectivity of the hosts and
   delegate the outgoing/incoming connections.

   This draft also doesn't recommend this use case as a good deployment
   model. However, there may be some scenarios that need this kind of
   deployment for some special purpose(strict application access control,
   content monitoring, e.g.).

3.2.  ULA with PA

   There are two classes of network probably to use ULA with PA
   addresses:

   o  Home network. Home networks are normally assigned with PA
      addresses to connect to the uplink of some an ISP. And besides,
      they may need internal routed networking even when the ISP link is
      down. Then ULA is a proper tool to fit the requirement. And in
      [RFC6204], it requires the CPE to support ULA.

   o  Enterprise network. An enterprise network is usually a managed
      network with a fixed PA space. The ULA could be used for internal
      connectivity redundancy and better internal connectivity or
      isolation of certain functions like OAM of servers.

   For either home networks or enterprise networks, the main purpose of
   using ULA along with PA is to provide a logically local routing plane
   separated from the globally routing plane. The benefit is to ensure
   stable and specific local communication regardless of the ISP uplink
   failure. This benefit is especially meaningful for the home network
   or private OAM function in an enterprise.

   In some special cases such as renumbering, enterprise administrators
   may want to avoid the need to renumber their internal-only, private
   nodes when they have to renumber the PA addresses of the whole
   network because of changing ISPs, ISPs restructure their address
   allocations, or whatever reasons. In these situations, ULA is an
   effective tool for the internal-only nodes.



Liu, et al.          Expires September 12, 2012               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      draft-liu-v6ops-ula-analysis            March 2012


   Besides the internal-only nodes, the public nodes can also benefit
   from ULA for renumbering. When renumbering, as RFC4192 suggested, it
   has a period to keep using the old prefix(es) before the new
   prefix(es) is(are) stable. In the process of adding new prefix(es)
   and deprecating old prefix(es), it is not easy to keep the local
   communication immune of global routing plane change. If we use ULA
   for the local communication, the separated local routing plane can
   isolate the affecting by global routing change.

   But for the separated local routing plane, there always be some
   argument that in practice the ULA+PA makes terrible operational
   complexity. But it is not a ULA-specific problem, the multiple-
   addresses-per-interface is an important feature of IPv6 protocol. So
   it is ambiguous that the argument is just about just ULA+PA only, or
   about the common running multiple addresses per-interface. [Editor's
   note: this issue has not achieved consensus yet]

   Another issue is mentioned in [RFC5220], there is a possibility that
   the longest matching rule will not be able to choose the correct
   address between ULAs and global unicast addresses for correct intra-
   site and extra-site communication. In [draft-ietf-6man-rfc3484bis] ,
   it claimed that a site-specific policy entry can be used to cause
   ULAs within a site to be preferred over global addresses.

3.3. Special routing/prefix

   - Special routing

   If you have a special routing scenario, of which [draft-baker-v6ops-
   b2b-private-routing] is an example, for various reasons you might
   want to have routing that you control and is separate from other
   routing. In the b2b case, even though two companies each have at
   least one ISP, they might choose to also use direct connectivity that
   only connects stated machines, such as a silicon foundry with client
   engineers that use it. A ULA provides a simple way to obtain such a
   prefix that would be used in accordance with an agreement between the
   parties.

   - Used as NAT64 prefix

   Since the NAT64 pref64 is just a group of local fake addresses for
   the DNS64 to point traffic to a NAT64, the pref64 is a very good use
   of ULA. It ensures that only local systems can use the translation
   resources of the NAT64 system since the ULA is not globally routable
   and helps clearly identify traffic that is locally contained and
   destine to a NAT64. Using ULA for Pref64 is deployed and it is an
   operational model.


Liu, et al.          Expires September 12, 2012               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      draft-liu-v6ops-ula-analysis            March 2012


   But there's an issue should be noticed. The NAT64 standard (RFC6146)
   mentioned the pref64 should align with RFC6052, in which the IPv4-
   Embedded IPv6 Address format was specified. If we pick a /48 for
   NAT64, it happened to be a standard 48/ part of ULA (7bit ULA famous
   prefix+ 1 "L" bit + 40bit Global ID). Then the 40bit of ULA is not
   violated to be filled with part of the 32bit IPv4 address. This is
   important, because the 40bit assures the uniqueness of ULA, if the
   prefix is shorter than /48, the 40bit would be violated, and this may
   cause conformance issue. But it is considered that the most common
   use case will be a /96 PREF64, or even /64 will be used. So it seems
   this issue is not common in current practice.

   It is most common that ULA Pref64 will be deployed on a single internal
   network, where the clients and the NAT64 share a common internal network.
   ULA will not be effective as Pref64 when the access network must use an
   Internet transit to receive the translation service of a NAT64 since the
   ULA will not route across the internet.

3.4. Used as identifier

   In [RFC6281], the protocol BTMM (Back To My Mac) needs to assign a
   topology-independent identifier to each client host according to the
   following considerations:

   o  TCP connections between two end hosts wish to survive in network
      changes.

   o  Sometimes one needs a constant identifier to be associated with a
      key so that the Security Association can survive the location
      changes[RFC6281].

   ULA can fit the requirements, and besides, ULA can be used directly
   because it belongs to the existing IPv6 code and it can be created by
   the ends themselves at boot time. As ULA would not cause any problem
   to the routing system, it can be considered as an ID/Locator split
   solution in this case.

   But there is a problem of ULAs being identifiers, that in theory it
   has the possibility of collision. However, the probability is
   desirable small enough.



4. Security Considerations

   Security considerations regarding ULAs, in general, please refer to
   the ULA specification RFC 4193 [RFC4193].

Internet-Draft      draft-liu-v6ops-ula-analysis            March 2012


5. IANA Considerations

   None.

6. Conclusions

   o  ULAs have been successfully deployed in a diverse set of
      circumstances including large private machine-to-machine type
      networks, enterprise networks with private systems, and within
      service providers to limit Internet communication with non-public
      services such as caching DNS servers and NAT64 translation
      resources.

   o  ULAs do not provide any intrinsic security benefit, but the
      characteristic that they cannot be routed on the internet may be
      leveraged as part of a multilayer security policy to limit the
      communication with the internet.

   o  ULAs are self-assigned and unique. Self-assigned allows for
      network deployments independent of RIR policy or documentation
      requirements. The fact that ULA require randomization within the
      prefix ensures that ULA is an improvement over RFC1918 deployments
      which were likely to collide when internal networks merged.
