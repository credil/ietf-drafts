Internet-Draft                    IRON                      January 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) [IRON] is a new
   internetworking and routing architecture that addresses numerous
   important issues including routing scaling, network renumbering,
   mobility management, mobile networks, multihoming, traffic
   engineering, NAT traversal and security.  IRON further provides a new
   interface type that augments the collection of interfaces available
   to a multiple interface (mif) node.

   Mif nodes are presented with the problem of managing a collection of
   multiple interfaces; each of which connects to an Internet Service
   Provider (ISP) and its respective provisioning domain
   [RFC6418][RFC6419].  Each such ISP interface receives a configuration
   that is specific to the ISP's provisioning domain, including network-
   layer addresses and prefixes, DNS server addresses, etc.  In
   operational practice, the mif node may receive overlapping
   provisioning information, e.g., if multiple ISPs supply the node with
   configuration information from the same private addressing plan.
   Moreover, each ISP interface's provisioning information may change
   over time, e.g., if the node is mobile.  It is therefore essential
   that the mif node select the correct interface for communications
   with services within a specific ISP provisioning domain and/or with
   correspondents in the global Internet.

   In this document, we focus on IRON's applicability for mif nodes with
   these ISP interface characteristics.  We show that IRON presents a
   new interface type that complements the mif node's ISP interface
   collection, i.e., the mif node need not use the IRON interface
   exclusively but instead views it as "just another interface" albeit
   with certain desirable properties not commonly supported by ISP
   interfaces.  IRON further observes the Internet Protocol (IP)
   standards [RFC0791][RFC2460], i.e., the same as for ordinary ISP
   interfaces.


2.  The IRON Interface

   The IRON interface is a non-broadcast, multiple access (NBMA) tunnel
   virtual interface that is configured over one or several ISP
   interfaces and coordinated with a Virtual Service Provider (VSP)
   server that may or may not be independent of any of the mif node's
   ISPs.  Example ISPs include 3GPP and BBF providers, but the IRON
   domain of applicability extends to all ISP network connection
   interface types.  While the IRON interface is configured over ISP
   interfaces, it appears to the mif node as "just another interface" in
   addition to the ISP interfaces.

Internet-Draft                    IRON                      January 2012


   IRON is based on Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) [INTAREA-VET],
   the Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL)
   [INTAREA-SEAL] and Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization [AERO] as
   its functional building blocks.  VET defines the IRON NBMA tunnel
   virtual interface model and specifies autoconfiguration and
   internetworking operation over the interface (including IRON
   interface neighbor coordination).  SEAL specifies the encapsulation
   format used by the IRON interface for deterministic error messaging
   as well as optional authentication, integrity and anti-replay
   capabilities.  Finally, AERO specifies a route optimization
   capability that the mif node can use to dynamically discover an IRON
   interface neighbor that is close to the final destination.

   The IRON interface receives persistent provisioning domain
   configuration information (including IP addresses/prefixes) from a
   VSP, and uses a nearby VSP server located in the Internet as a
   default router for reaching Internet correspondents.  The VSP
   provisioning information remains stable even if the mif node's ISP
   interface configurations change.  The IRON interface therefore
   appears as a virtual direct connection to the Internet independent of
   any ISPs as shown in Figure 1:

                  Figure 1: MIF Node with IRON Interface

   The IRON interface provides the mif node with a stable "handle" for
   connecting to correspondents in the Internet.  Since the IRON
   interface configuration remains stable even if the underlying ISP
   interface configurations change, the interface supports mobility
   management, multihoming and traffic engineering.  However, the IRON
   interface need not be used for communications between the mif node
   and services within a specific ISP network, since the ISP interface
   itself may be better positioned to access those services.

   A common mif node scenario involves a mobile device such as a handset
   with both 3GPP and WiFi interfaces, where the 3GPP interface connects
   to a cellular service provider and the WiFi interface connects to a
   wireless network serviced by a BBF cable modem provider.  In that
   case, the IRON interface can provide simultaneous operation over both
   underlying interfaces even if both interfaces receive overlapping IP
   address and prefix information.  This is due to the fact that the
   IRON interface operates based on interface identifiers and not IP
   addresses as the means for keeping the underlying interfaces
   separate.

   The IRON interface therefore becomes just another candidate for
   interface selection the same as the ISP interfaces, and can be
   selected for communications in which a stable addressing
   configuration is necessary.  As a result, the IRON interface is a new
   interface type that should be accounted for by mif node interface
   selection standards.

   (RANGER) [RFC5720] examines recursive arrangements of enterprise
   networks that can apply to a very broad set of use-case scenarios
   [RFC6139].  These same use-case scenarios apply also to IRON.
