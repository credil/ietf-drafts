Abstract

   Mobile IP protocols provide IP session continuity to Mobile Nodes at
   the expense of creating triangular routes via a centralized Home
   Agent.  Increased latency and network resource use, introduction of a
   single point of failure and a network choke point are among the
   undesirable side effects of the current protocols.  This document
   describes an alternative approach where the Mobile Node makes use of
   dynamically-assigned Home Agent that is located close to the
   Corresponding Node.

1.  Introduction

   In the context of Mobile IP [RFC5563][RFC6275][RFC5213][RFC5944]
   following two attributes are defined for the IP service provided to
   the mobile hosts:

   IP session continuity: The ability to maintain an ongoing IP session
   by keeping the same local end-point IP address throughout the session
   despite the host moving among different IP networks.  The IP address
   of the host may differ among independent IP sessions (e.g., host
   using IP1 for its session with CN1, and IP2 for its session with
   CN2), but that does not jeopardize the IP session continuity.  IP
   session continuity is essential for mobile hosts to maintain ongoing
   IP sessions without any interruption.

   IP address reachability: The ability to maintain the same IP address
   for an extended period of time.  The IP address shall stay the same
   across independent IP sessions, and even in the absence of any IP
   session.  The IP address may be published in a long-term registry
   (e.g., DNS), and it shall be available for serving incoming
   connections.  IP address reachability is essential for mobile hosts
   to use specific/fixed/published IP addresses.

   Mobile IP is designed to provide both IP session continuity and IP
   address reachability to mobile hosts.  The basic operation of Mobile
   IP involves the following: Network assigning a fixed IP address to
   the Mobile Node (the Home Address, HoA) from a fixed node (the Home
   Agent, HA), the HA receiving location updates from the Mobile Node
   (MN), and the HA intercepting IP packets on behalf of the MN and
   tunneling them to the MN.  That way the MN ensures that it can keep
   receiving IP packets irrespective of its movement and location in the
   network.

   One obvious side effect of this approach is the creation of sub-
   optimal routing paths between the MN and the other nodes it is
   communicating with (the Corresponding Nodes, CN).  The routing path
   between the MN and a CN has to traverse the HA.  Unless the HA is
   already located on the path between the MN and the CN, the path
   traversing the HA would create a so-called triangular route which is
   longer than the direct path between the two end-points.  Longer path
   yields additional transmission latency and use of network resources
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

   Furthermore, forcing all MN traffic via the HA would also create a
   bottleneck in the network by overloading a single network element.
   The cost of building and operating such a network would increase,
   whereas the overall network reliability would decrease
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

   The objective of the solution described in this document is to
   provide IP session continuity to MNs without creating the
   aforementioned side effects.

   The solution does not cover support for IP address reachability.
   This is considered to be acceptable, because only a very small set of
   applications really need IP address reachability.  Those are the
   applications that are running as servers.  Such applications cannot
   avoid using standard Mobile IP since they need to accept incoming
   connections at a specific/published IP address.

3.  Solution in a Nutshell

   The triangular routing side effect of Mobile IP can be remedied if
   the HA were positioned on the direct path between the MN and the CN.
   That way the IP packets would naturally flow thru the HA and not
   follow a triangular route.  But, this is not possible when a single/
   fixed IP address is assigned to the MN and it is served by a single
   HA at a fixed location [RFC5563][RFC6275][RFC5213][RFC5944] while the
   MN is communicating with CNs that are located in multiple different
   locations in the Internet.

   The solution proposed in this document utilizes HAs located near CNs
   (Corresponding Home Agent, CHA) to dynamically allocate a HoA to the
   MN (Corresponding Home Address, CHoA).  Such an address will be used
   throughout the IP session between the MN and the CN.  Given the
   topological proximity of the CHA to the direct path between the MN
   and the CN, it is expected that this solution would not have the
   negative side effects of providing IP session continuity.

   CHA may be co-located with the CN (the original content server or the
   CDN server), or located in the same site as the CN (e.g., on the load
   balancer, or a dedicated node), or located in an ISP serving the CN
   site.  Not all CNs may be served by a CHA.  In case there is no CHA
   serving the CN, the MN and the CN may communicate using the HoA via
   the HA.

   It is expected that CHAs would be deployed for access to heavily-used
   content on the Internet (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, etc.).
   CHA deployment is beneficial to the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) of
   the MN as the operator offloads the mobility management and data
   transmission via its core network, and enhances the user experience
   through transmission latency reduction.  For that reason it is
   expected that the MNO would enter a business agreement with other
   entities taking over a slice of its mobility management
   responsibility.  Depending on the location of the CHAs, types of
   other entities include the owner of the CN, the data center provider
   hosting the CN, the ISP or a CDN provider serving the CN.  Note that
   the owner of the CN already benefits from the use of CHA thanks to
   the transmission latency reduction, and that may or may not be a
   sufficient justification for that entity to deploy a CHA.
   Furthermore, there are MNOs that also own data center and ISP, in
   which case the offloading agreement would take place between the
   different business units of the same company.

   The MN may be using multiple applications at the same time, and each
   application may be using a different CHA.  For example, the MN may be
   configured to use CHoA1 for App1 with CN1 via CHA1, and use CHoA2 for
   App2 with CN2 via CHA2 at the same time.

   Assume that the MN is already configured with an IP address allocated
   from the access network it is attached to.  Let this IP address be
   called IPxs.

   Step 1:

   An application on the MN attempts to initiate communication with the
   CN.

   Step 2:

   Network stack on the MN resolves the CN hostname to the IP address of
   CN.  In parallel with that, the stack also tries to resolve the
   cha.CN_hostname in order to discover the CHA serving the CN, if there
   is any.

   Step 3:

   If a CHA is discovered at Step 2, then the network stack sends a
   Binding Update to the CHA.  The HoA in the Binding Update is set to
   unspecified IP address (0.0.0.0/::) in order to request a
   dynamically-allocated CHoA from the CHA.

   Step 4:

   A tunnel is setup between the MN and the CHA as a result of Step 3.
   The tunnel end-points are IPxs and IP address of CHA (IPcha).

   Step 5:

   The socket used by the application is bound to the CHoA.  The end-to-
   end communication between the App and the CN uses CHoA and IP address
   of CN (IPcn).  Those IP packets are tunneled between the MN and the
   CHA.

   Figure 2 depicts the high-level message flow for re-establishing the
   MN-CHA tunnel when the MN performs an IP handover.

                           Figure 2. IP handover.



   Step 1:

   IP stack of MN configures a new IP address from the new access
   network (IPxs2).

   Step 2:

   MN sends a Binding Update to the CHA, binding CHoA to IPxs2.

   Step 3:

   A new tunnel is setup between the MN and the CHA (between the IPxs2
   and IPcha).

   Step 4:

   The application and the CN continue their end-to-end communication
   using the new tunnel.  The end point IP addresses stay the same (CHoA
   and IPcn), therefore the underlying routing change is transparent to
   the communication end-points (CN, and the transport layer and above
   on MN).

   Figure 3 depicts the high-level message flow for tearing down the MN-
   CHA tunnel when the application closes the connection.

                              Figure 3. Tear down.



   Step 1:

   The application attempts to close the session with the CN.

   Step 2:

   The network stack closes the connection with the CN (e.g., TCP FIN).

   Step 3:

   The MN sends a Binding Update to the CHA in order to de-register the
   binding between the IPxs and the CHoA.  Dynamically-allocated CHoA
   and the tunnel between the MN and the CHA are released at this step.

   Step 1:

   An application attempts to resolve the IP address of the CN by
   issuing a Socket API call (e.g., gethostbyname, getaddrinfo).

   Step 2a:

   DNS client on the MN sends a DNS request to the DNS server in order
   to resolve the IP address of the CN.

   Step 2b:

   In parallel with Step 2a, DNS client on the MN should also send a DNS
   request to the DNS server in order to resolve the IP address of
   cha.CN_hostname.

   Steps 3a and 3b:

   DNS server returns the results.

   Step 4:

   The application attempts to send its first packet to the CN by
   issuing a Socket API call (e.g., connect, sendto).

   Step 5:

   If Step 3b has produced an IP address for the CHA (which indicates
   availability of a CHA for the CN), then the MN shall send a Binding
   Update to the CHA.  The Binding Update shall include a HoA that is
   set to the unspecified IP address (0.0.0.0 for IPv4, :: for IPv6).

   Steps 6 and 7:

   The CHA may need to authenticate the incoming Binding Update in order
   to authorize it.  This step may require AAA [RFC2865][RFC3588]
   between the CHA and a AAA server.

   Step 8:

   The CHA shall return a Binding Acknowledgement to the MN.  This
   message should contain a dynamically-allocated HoA.  This HoA is
   regarded as a CHoA.

   Step 9:

   The MN shall configure the received CHoA on its stack.  The MN and
   the CHA shall also setup a tunnel between the care-of address in the
   Binding Update (the IPxs) and IPcha.  The MN shall setup a routing
   table entry to forward any IP packet whose destination address is the
   IP address of the CN to the CHA via the tunnel.  The CHA shall setup
   a routing table entry to forward any IP packet whose destination
   address is CHoA to the MN via the tunnel.

   Step 10:

   The MN shall assign the newly-configured CHoA as the source address
   for the socket used by the application.  If a connection-oriented

   transport protocol is used, then a connection shall be established
   (e.g., via TCP 3-way handshake) between the CHoA and the IPcn (as
   obtained in Step 3a) via the tunnel between the MN and the CHA.

   Step 11:

   The communication between the application and the CN shall use CHoA
   and the IPcn as the end-points, and go via the tunnel between the MN
   and the CHA.

   The MN stack shall prevent use of CHoA and the associated tunnel for
   any IP sesssion other than the ones between the MN and the CNs served
   by the CHA.  The source address selection mechanism on the MN should
   select CHoA for any CN whose discovered CHA matches the CHA
   associated with the CHoA, and shall not select CHoA for any other
   communication.

4.2.  Handover

   Figure 5 depicts the detailed message flow for re-establishing the
   MN-CHA tunnel when the MN performs an IP handover.

   Step 1:

   The MN configures a new IP address from the new access network
   (IPxs2).

   Step 2:

   When the IP address of the MN changes, the MN shall send a Binding
   Update to the CHA for informing the CHA about this change and binding

   the CHoA to the new IP address.  The Binding Update shall include a
   CoA set to the IPxs2 and the HoA set to the CHoA.

   Step 3:

   The CHA shall process the incoming Binding Update according to
   [RFC6275][RFC5944] and return a Binding Acknowledgement.

   Step 4:

   The MN and the CHA shall setup a new tunnel with each other upon
   successful execution of Steps 3 and 4.  The tunnel end-points shall
   be set to IPxs2 and IPcha.  The CHA shall forward any incoming packet
   whose destination is CHoA towards the MN via the tunnel.  The MN
   shall forward any outgoing packet whose source address is CHoA
   towards the CN via the tunnel.

4.3.  Teardown

   Figure 6 depicts the detailed message flow for tearing down the MN-
   CHA tunnel when the application closes the connection.

                    |      |                  |       |
                    |      |<----------[4]----|       |
                    |      |                  |       |

                       Figure 6. Detailed tear down.



   Step 1:

   The application attempts to close the session with the CN.

   Step 2:

   The MN shall close the connection with the CN, if a connection-
   oriented transport is used (e.g., TCP, SCTP).



Yegin, et al.            Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                 CNet-Homing                  October 2013


   Step 3:

   The MN should send a Binding Update to CHA with lifetime set to 0.
   Note that the MN may choose not to tear down the tunnel immediately
   after the IP session terminates.  The MN may put a grace period on
   this action and keep both the tunnel and the CHoA for a while in case
   they get used for a subsequent IP session with the same CN or another
   CN using the same CHA.  The amount of grace period is a configurable
   parameter.

   Step 4:

   The CHA shall send a Binding Acknowledgement back to the MN.  The CHA
   and the MN shall release the tunnel, remove the forwarding entries
   for the CHoA.  The CHA shall return the CHoA to the pool of available
   IP addresses.  The MN shall unconfigure the CHoA on its stack.

   If a connectionless protocol is used (e.g., UDP) between the MN and
   the CN, then the tear down may be triggered based on an inactivity
   timer or other indications.

5.  Variation

   A PMIP-based variation of this solution is under construction and
   will appear in a future version of this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   If the Binding Update message is not origin authenticated, then it
   may be leveraged for a DoS attack depleting the CHoA pool on the CHA.

   This threat may be mitigated by allocating the CHoA from a very large
   address pool, such as 10.0.0.0/8 for IPv4, or a /64 prefix for IPv6
   that is not trivial to deplete.  Depleting such a large address pool
   requires a significant brute-force attack.  At that point the type of
   attack and its mitigations change and fall outside the scope of this
   document.  Such attacks trigger CN and serving ISP/data center's
   defense against brute force attacks.

   Another mitigation is to use origin authentication, replay and
   integrity protection on the Mobile IP messages
   [RFC6275][RFC5944][RFC4285] .

   The tunnel between the MN and the CHA is created for the sole purpose
   of carrying IP packets between the MN and the CN.  It is not meant to
   be used for carrying IP packets between the MN and arbitrary nodes on
   the Internet.  In order to prevent abuse of this tunnel the CHA shall
   setup firewall rules to drop any packets that are sent by the MN and

   that do not have a valid destination IP address (i.e., IP address of
   one of the CNs served by the CHA).
