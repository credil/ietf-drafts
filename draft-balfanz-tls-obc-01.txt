Internet-Draft                   TLS OBC                   November 2011


1.  Introduction

   Transport Layer Security (TLS [RFC5246]) allows clients to
   authenticate themselves using Client Certificates.  In practice,
   clients tend to ask for user consent before using Client
   Certificates.  This is to allay privacy concerns about user-
   identifying information in the Client Certificate, and also to let
   the user choose among possibly many certificates that can be used by
   the client for the TLS session.

   The user experience of obtaining this consent, along with that of
   obtaining the certificates in the first place, has traditionally
   presented a hurdle to user adoption.  Additionally, operational
   constraints on the server side can make it difficult for service
   providers to switch from a cookie-based authentication scheme to
   certificate-based TLS client authentication.

   The TLS Origin-Bound Certificates extension (TLS-OBC) is a TLS
   extension [RFC6066] that allows clients to use certificate-based
   client authentication without having to obtain user consent before
   using certificates.  A client creates at most one (self-signed)
   certificate of any given type (e.g., rsa_sign or ecdsa_sign) per web
   origin [WebOrigin], and does not include user-identifying information
   into such origin-bound certificates, thus making user consent and
   user-assisted certificate selection unnecessary.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Extension Dependencies

   The client SHOULD use TLS-OBC during a TLS session only if it also
   uses the TLS Encrypted Client Certificates [EncryptedClientCerts]
   extension during that TLS session.


2.  Origin-Bound Certificates

   An origin-bound certificate is a self-issued certificate that the
   client uses for TLS client authentication for a particular web origin
   [WebOrigin].  Origin-bound certificates MUST be self-signed, i.e., a
   private key corresponding to the certified public key MUST be used to
   sign the certificate.

   Clients MUST NOT re-use the same origin-bound certificate for more



Balfanz, et al.           Expires May 16, 2012                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                   TLS OBC                   November 2011


   than one web origin.

2.1.  Certificate Creation

   Clients create origin-bound certificates when asked to perform TLS
   client authentication after negotiating the "ob_cert" extension with
   a server from that origin (see Section 3.5), and they do not already
   have a valid origin-bound certificate for that origin available for
   use.

   Clients SHOULD NOT re-use the same key pair for more than one origin-
   bound certificate.  To do so would violate the privacy properties
   required by origin-bound certificates.

   When creating an origin-bound certificate, it is RECOMMENDED that
   clients use the PrintableString representation of "anonymous.invalid"
   as the common name component of the Distinguished Name of both the
   certificate's Issuer and Subject, with no other name components
   present.

   It is RECOMMENDED that clients pick a lifetime for the new
   certificate between one month and one year (perhaps depending on an
   assessment of how well the private key is protected on the host
   platform).  The client SHALL use the notBefore and notAfter fields in
   the new certificate to record the lifetime of the new certificate.

2.1.1.  Origin-Bound Certificate Extension

   Origin-bound certificates MUST be X.509 v3 certificates, and MUST
   include the origin-bound certificate extension (OID
   1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.1.6), shown below.  This extension MUST be marked
   critical.

   The data of the extension, "OriginBoundCertificate", will be the
   ASCII Serialization of the certificate's web origin [WebOrigin] as an
   IA5String.

    id-ce-originBoundCertificate OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
            { enterprises Google 2 1 6 }

    OriginBoundCertificate ::=
            IA5String

                                 Figure 1

   The server MAY reject the origin-bound certificate if it determines
   that the web origin included in the "OriginBoundCertificate"
   extension does not match the server's origin (for example, if it

Internet-Draft                   TLS OBC                   November 2011


   doesn't match the host name specified in the Server Name Indication
   TLS extension).  It is, however, RECOMMENDED that the server merely
   report the value of the web origin to the upper layers in the
   protocol stack, and leave it up to those layers to make use of the
   web origin value (e.g., to assist developers in debugging the
   feature).

2.2.  Certificate and Key Rotation

   After a client has created an origin-bound certificate for a certain
   web origin, the client SHOULD re-use the certificate for a period of
   time, and then discard it.

   The client MUST discard existing origin-bound certificate at or
   before the notAfter time indicated in each certificate.

   The client MAY opt to discard an existing origin-bound certificate at
   any time of its choosing prior to the notAfter time indicated in the
   certificate.  In particular, the client may delete an existing
   origin-bound certificate in response to a user request to clear
   privacy-sensitive state from their user-agent, ensuring that a fresh
   certificate will be generated the next time a user visits that
   origin.

   The client SHOULD use a new key pair when it generates a new origin-
   bound certificate.


3.  Changes to The Handshake Message Contents

3.1.  Extension Definition

   This document defines a new TLS extension, "ob_cert" (with tentative
   extension type 13175, or 0x3377), which indicates that client and
   server agree to allow the client to use an origin-bound certificate
   to authenticate itself to the server.

   To indicate support for origin-bound certificates, the client
   includes an extension of type "ob_cert" in the Extended Client Hello
   message.  To indicate that a subsequent CertificateRequest message
   requests an origin-bound certificate, the server includes the same
   extension in its Extended Server Hello message.

   The "ob_cert" TLS extension will be assigned a value from the TLS
   ExtensionType registry, and will contain zero length
   "extension_data".  For testing, we will use the extension type value
   of 0x3377.  For this type value, the entire encoding of the extension
   will be 33 77 00 00.

Internet-Draft                   TLS OBC                   November 2011


3.2.  Client Hello

   A client wishing to indicate support for origin-bound client
   certificates MUST include the "ob_cert" in the extended Client Hello
   message to a server from a particular web origin.

3.3.  Server Hello

   A server that receives a Client Hello message containing the
   "ob_cert" extension MAY choose to include the same extension in the
   extended Server Hello message.  If it does, the client and server are
   considered to have negotiated origin-bound client certificates for
   the session.

3.4.  Certificate Request

   A server MAY choose to send a Certificate Request message to the
   client.  If the session uses origin-bound client certificates, the
   server SHOULD use an empty "certificate_authorities" list.

   A client that receives a Certificate Request during a session for
   which origin-bound client certificates were negotiated MUST ignore
   the "certificate_authorities" list.

3.5.  Client Certificate

   TLS [RFC5246] requires that a client that receives a Certificate
   Request message must send a Client Certificate message in response
   (which may or may not include client certificates).  If client and
   server negotiated origin-bound client certificates, then the client
   SHOULD include an origin-bound certificate in the Client Certificate
   message.

   If a client includes an origin-bound certificate in the Client
   Certificate message during a session for which origin-bound client
   certificates were negotiated, the included certificate MUST

   o  be an origin-bound certificate for the web origin of the server,
      and

   o  match a certificate type requested by the server in the
      Certificate Request message.

   If a client doesn't possess a certificate meeting the above
   requirements, it SHOULD self-issue a certificate of a type requested
   by the server in the Certificate Request message and include the
   newly-generated certificate in the Client Certificate message.  Only
   if the client is not capable of providing a certificate of the

Internet-Draft                   TLS OBC                   November 2011


   requested type SHOULD it include an empty "certificate_list" in the
   Client Certificate message.

   A server verifying a Client Certificate message in a handshake that
   negotiated origin-bound client certificates MUST verify that the
   certificate is self-signed, rather than being signed by any
   particular CA.  The server MUST verify that the public key in the
   certificate corresponds to the key used to authenticate the client in
   the handshake.  The server SHOULD ignore the Issuer and Subject in
   the presented certificate.  The server MUST ignore the notBefore and
   notAfter fields in the certificate.

   Finally, the server MUST verify that the certificate contains the
   origin-bound extension, and MAY verify that the origin identified in
   that certificate matches the server (see Section 2.1.1).


4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  Third-Party Tracking

   A third party might be able to track a client across multiple
   sessions by observing the use of the same origin-bound certificate.
   To alleviate this concern, clients SHOULD also implement the
   Encrypted Client Certificates Extension [EncryptedClientCerts], and
   use it concurrently with TLS-OBC.  The Encrypted Client Certificates
   Extension [EncryptedClientCerts] ensures that the origin-bound
   certificate is sent after TLS established secrecy on the channel
   between client and server.

4.2.  Server Tracking

   A client can prevent server tacking by deleting the origin-bound
   certificate for the server's Web origin.  This could happen, for
   example, when the user elects to remove all cookies for that origin.

4.3.  Cookie Hardening

   One way TLS-OBC can be used to strengthen cookie-based authentication
   is by "binding" cookies to an origin-bound certificate.  The server,
   when issuing a cookie for an HTTP session, would associate the
   client's origin-bound certificate with the session (either by
   encoding information about the certificate unforgeably in the cookie,
   or by associating the certificate with the cookie's session through
   some other means).  That way, if and when a cookie gets stolen from a
   client, it cannot be used over a TLS connection initiated by a
   different client - the cookie thief would also have to steal the
   private key associated with the client's origin-bound certificate, a

Internet-Draft                   TLS OBC                   November 2011


   task considerably harder especially when we assume the existence of a
   Trusted Platform Module or other Secure Element that can store the
   origin-bound-certificate's private key.

4.4.  Key Lengths

   If the client uses RSA key pairs, the key length should be at least
   1024 bits.  For longer-lived origin-bound certificates, the key
   length should be 2048 bits.

   If the client uses ECDSA key pairs, the key length should be at least
   160 bits.
