		 <t>Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshakes often include fairly 
		 static information, such as the server
   certificate and a list of trusted Certification Authorities (CAs).
   This information can be of considerable size, particularly if the server
   certificate is bundled with a complete certificate path (including
   all intermediary certificates up to the trust anchor public key).</t>
   
   <t>This document defines an extension that omits the exchange of already 
   available information. The TLS client informs a server of cached information, 
   for example from a previous TLS handshake, allowing the server to omit 
   the already available information.</t>

   <t>Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshakes often include fairly 
   static information, such as the server certificate and a list of 
   trusted Certification Authorities (CAs). This information can be of 
   considerable size, particularly if the server certificate is bundled 
   with a complete certificate path (including all intermediary

   <t>Optimizing the exchange of information to a minimum helps to 
   improve performance in environments where devices are connected to a 
   network with characteristics like low bandwidth, high latency and high 
   loss rate. These types of networks exist, for example, when smart objects 
   are connected using a low power IEEE 802.15.4 radio. For more information 
   about the challenges with smart object deployments please see 
   <xref target="I-D.iab-smart-object-workshop"/>.</t>

   <t>This specification defines a TLS extension that allows a client and a 
   server to exclude transmission of cached information from the TLS handshake.

<t>
   This document defines a new extension type (cached_information(TBD)), which is used in
   client hello and server hello messages. The extension type
   is specified as follows.
</t>
        <t><figure>
            <artwork>
              <![CDATA[
      enum {
           cached_information(TBD), (65535)
      } ExtensionType;
]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>

<t>
The extension_data field of this extension, when included in the
client hello, MUST contain the CachedInformation structure.
</t>
        <t><figure>
            <artwork>
              <![CDATA[
      enum {
           certificate_chain(1), trusted_cas(2) (255)
      } CachedInformationType;

      struct {
           CachedInformationType type;
           HashAlgorithm hash;
           opaque hash_value<1..255>;
      } CachedObject;

      struct {
           CachedObject cached_info<1..2^16-1>;
      } CachedInformation;
]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>

		  <t>
   When the CachedInformationType identifies a certificate_chain, then
   the hash_value field MUST include a hash calculated over the certificate_list
   element of a server side Certificate message, excluding the three
   length bytes of the certificate_list vector.</t>

<t>When the CachedInformationType identifies a trusted_cas, then the hash_value
   MUST include a hash calculated over the certificate_authorities
   element of a server side CertificateRequest message, excluding the
   two length bytes of the certificate_authorities vector.
</t>
<t>
   The hash algorithm used to calculate hash values is conveyed in the 'hash' field of the 
   CachedObject element. This document defines the following hash algorithms:   
   <list style="symbols"> 
   <t>SHA-1: NIST FIPS PUB 180-3 <xref target="SHA"/></t>
   <t>SHA-224: RFC 3874 <xref target="RFC3874"/></t>

   <t>SHA-384: NIST FIPS PUB 180-3 <xref target="SHA"/></t>
   <t>SHA-512: NIST FIPS PUB 180-3 <xref target="SHA"/></t>
<!--   <t>MD5: RFC 1321 <xref target="RFC1321"/></t> --> 
</list> 

</t>
<t>
   This document establishes a registry for CachedInformationType types and additional 
   values can be added following the policy described in <xref target="IANA"/>.
</t>

   </section>

<section title="Exchange Specification">

<t>Clients supporting this extension MAY include the "cached_information" extension in the
   (extended) client hello, which MAY contain zero or more CachedObject attributes. 
</t>
<t>
Server supporting this extension MAY include the "cached_information" extension 
in the (extended) server hello, which MAY contain one or more CachedObject attributes.
By returning the "cached_information" extension the server indicates that it
supports caching of each present CachedObject that matches the specified hash value. 
The server MAY support other cached objects that are not present in the extension.
</t>

<t>Note: Clients may need the ability to cache different values
   depending on other information in the Client Hello that modify what
   values the server uses, in particular the Server Name Indication
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4366-bis"/> value.
</t>

<t>Following a successful exchange of "cached_information" extensions,
   the server MAY send fingerprints of the cached information in the handshake
   exchange as a replacement for the exchange of the full data. 
   <xref target="certificate_chain"/> and <xref target="trusted_cas"/> defines the syntax of the 
fingerprinted information.</t>

<t>The handshake protocol MUST proceed using the information as
   if it was provided in the handshake protocol. The Finished message
   MUST be calculated over the actual data exchanged in the handshake
   protocol. That is, the Finished message will be calculated over the
   hash values of cached information objects and not over the cached
   information that were omitted from transmission.</t>

<t>The server MUST NOT include more than one fingerprint for a single information element, i.e., at maximum only one CachedObject structure 
per replaced information is provided.</t>


<section anchor="certificate_chain" title="Fingerprint of the Certificate Chain">

<t>When an object of type 'certificate_chain' is provided in the client
   hello, the server MAY send a fingerprint instead of the complete certificate chain as shown below.</t>

<t>The original handshake message syntax is defined in RFC 5246 <xref target="RFC5246"/> and has the following 
structure:</t>

        <t><figure>
            <artwork>
              <![CDATA[
      opaque ASN.1Cert<1..2^24-1>;

      struct {
          ASN.1Cert certificate_list<0..2^24-1>;
      } Certificate;
]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>
		  
<t>By using the extension defined in this document the following information is sent:</t>
        <t><figure>
            <artwork>
              <![CDATA[
struct {
              CachedObject ASN.1Cert<1..2^24-1>;
} Certificate;
]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>

<t>The opaque ASN.1Cert structure is replaced with the CachedObject structure defined in this document.</t>
		  
 <t>Note:  <xref target="I-D.wouters-tls-oob-pubkey"/> allows a PKIX
 certificate containing only the SubjectPublicKeyInfo instead of the full information typically found in a certificate. 
 Hence, when this specification is used in combination with <xref target="I-D.wouters-tls-oob-pubkey"/> 
 and the negotiated certificate type is RawPublicKey then the TLS server sends the hashed 
Certificate element that contains a ASN.1Cert with the mentioned raw public key.</t>
   
   </section> 

<section anchor="trusted_cas" title="Fingerprint for Trusted CAs">

<t>When a hash for an object of type 'trusted_cas' is provided in the
   client hello, the server MAY send a fingerprint instead of the complete certificate authorities information as shown below.</t>

<t>The original handshake message syntax is defined in RFC 5246 <xref target="RFC5246"/> and has the following 
structure:</t>

           <t><figure>
            <artwork>

          SignatureAndHashAlgorithm
            supported_signature_algorithms<2^16-1>;
          DistinguishedName certificate_authorities<0..2^16-1>;
      } CertificateRequest;
]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>
		  <t>By using the extension defined in this document the following information is sent:</t>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
            <t>The hash algorithm used in this specification is required to have
   reasonable random properties in order to provide reasonably unique
   identifiers. There is no requirement that this
   hash algorithm must have strong collision resistance. <!-- However, since
   the hash algorithm is used to represent data in the finished
   calculation, the security properties of the finished calculation will
   change if a weaker hash algorithm is used to represent cached
   information compared with the hash algorithm used to calculate the
   finished message.--> </t>

<t>Caching information in an encrypted handshake (such as a renegotiated
   handshake) and sending a hash of that cached information in an
   unencrypted handshake might introduce integrity or data disclosure
   issues as it enables an attacker to identify if a known object (such
   as a known server certificate) has been used in previous encrypted
   handshakes. Information object types defined in this specification,
   such as server certificates, are public objects and usually not
   sensitive in this regard, but implementers should be aware if any
   cached information are subject to such security concerns and in such
   case SHOULD NOT send a hash over encrypted data in en unencrypted
   handshake.</t>
