1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Traversal Using Relays
   around NAT (TURN) protocol.

   The TURN protocol is a specification allowing hosts behind NAT to
   control the operation of a relay server.  The relay server allows
   hosts to exchange packets with its peers.  The peers themselves may
   also be behind NATs.  RFC 5766 [RFC5766] defines the specifics of the
   TURN protocol.

   The "turn" and "turns" URI schemes are used to designate a TURN
   server (also known as a relay) on Internet hosts accessible using the
   TURN protocol.  With the advent of standards such as [WEBRTC], we
   anticipate a plethora of endpoints and web applications to be able to
   identify and communicate with such a TURN server to carry out the
   TURN protocol.  This also implies those endpoints and/or applications
   to be provisioned with appropriate configuration required to identify

   the TURN server.  Having an inconsistent syntax has its drawbacks and
   can result in non-interoperable solutions.  It can result in
   solutions that are ambiguous and have implementation limitations on
   the different aspects of the syntax and alike.  The "turn/turns" URI
   scheme helps alleviate most of these issues by providing a consistent
   way to describe, configure and exchange the information identifying a
   TURN server.  This would also prevent the shortcomings inherent with
   encoding similar information in non-uniform syntaxes such as the ones
   proposed in [WEBRTC], for example.

   [RFC5928] defines a resolution mechanism to convert a secure flag, a
   host name or IP address, an eventually empty port, and an eventually
   empty transport to a list of IP address, port, and TURN transport
   tuples.

   To simplify the provisioning of TURN clients, this document defines a
   TURN and a TURNS URI scheme that can carry the four components needed
   for the resolution mechanism.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when
   they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in ALL CAPS (such
   as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual English meanings, and
   are not to be interpreted as RFC 2119 key words.

3.  Definitions of the TURN and TURNS URI

3.1.  URI Scheme Syntax

   A TURN/TURNS URI has the following formal ABNF syntax [RFC5234]:

   turnURI       = scheme ":" turn-host [ ":" turn-port ]
                   [ "?transport=" transport ]
   scheme        = "turn" / "turns"
   transport     = "udp" / "tcp" / transport-ext
   transport-ext = 1*unreserved
   turn-host     = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name
   turn-port     = *DIGIT
   IP-literal    = "[" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture  ) "]"
   IPvFuture     = "v" 1*HEXDIG "." 1*( unreserved / sub-delims / ":" )
   IPv6address   =                              6( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   /                       "::" 5( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [               h16 ] "::" 4( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *1( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 3( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *2( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 2( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *3( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"    h16 ":"   ls32

                   / [ *4( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              ls32
                   / [ *5( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              h16
                   / [ *6( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"
   h16           = 1*4HEXDIG
   ls32          = ( h16 ":" h16 ) / IPv4address
   IPv4address   = dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet
   dec-octet     = DIGIT                 ; 0-9
                   / %x31-39 DIGIT       ; 10-99
                   / "1" 2DIGIT          ; 100-199
                   / "2" %x30-34 DIGIT   ; 200-249
                   / "25" %x30-35        ; 250-255
   reg-name      = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )


   <unreserved>, <pct-encoded>, and <sub-delims> are specified in
   [RFC3986].  The core rules <DIGIT> and <HEXDIGIT> are used as
   described in Appendix B of RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

   The <host>, <port> and <transport> components are passed without
   modification to the [RFC5928] algorithm.  <secure> is set to false if
   <scheme> is equal to "turn" and set to true if <scheme> is equal to
   "turns" and passed to the [RFC5928] algorithm with the other
   components.

3.2.  URI Scheme Semantics

   The "turn" and "turns" URI schemes are used to designate a TURN
   server (also known as a relay) on Internet hosts accessible using the
   TURN protocol.  The TURN protocol supports sending messages over UDP,
   TCP or TLS-over-TCP.  The "turns" URI scheme MUST be used when TURN
   is run over TLS-over-TCP (or in the future DTLS-over-UDP) and the
   "turn" scheme MUST be used otherwise.

   The required <host> part of the "turn" URI denotes the TURN server
   host.

   As specified in [RFC5766] and [RFC5928], the <port> part, if present,
   denotes the port on which the TURN server is awaiting connection
   requests.  If it is absent, the default port is 3478 for both UDP and
   TCP.  The default port for TURN over TLS is 5349.

   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort

   According to [RFC6982], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the resolution mechanism are discussed in
   Section 5 of [RFC5928].  Note that this section contains normative
   text defining authentication procedures to be followed by turn
   clients when TLS is used.

   The "turn" and "turns" URI schemes do not introduce any specific
   security issues beyond the security considerations discussed in
   [RFC3986].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the registration information for the "turn" and
   "turns" URI Schemes (in accordance with [RFC4395]).

Appendix B.  Design Notes

   o  The ABNF in this document duplicates the <IP-literal>,
      <IPv4address>, and <reg-name> productions and other dependent
      productions from [RFC3986], instead of referencing them.  This is
      because the definitions in RFC 3986 are for hierarchical URIs, so
      using these references in an opaque URI made reviewers think that
      a hierarchical URI parser could be used to parse the URIs defined
      in this document.

   o  One recurring comment was to stop using the suffix "s" on URI
      scheme, and to move the secure option to a parameter (e.g.
      ";proto=tls").  We decided against this idea because the STUN URI
      does not have a ";proto=" parameter and we would have lost the
      symmetry between the TURN and STUN URIs.  A more detailed account
      of the reasoning behind this is available at <http://blog.marc
      .petit-huguenin.org/2012/09/on-design-of-stun-and-turn-uri-
      formats.html>

   o  Following the advice of RFC 4395 section 2.2., and because the
      TURN URI does not describe a hierarchical structure, the TURN URIs
      are opaque URIs.

   o  <password> is not used in the URIs because it is deprecated
      [RFC3986].  <username> and <auth> are not used in the URIs because
      they do not guide the resolution mechanism.

   o  As discussed at IETF 72 in Dublin, there is no generic parameters
      in the URI to prevent compatibility issues.

Appendix C.  Release notes

   This section must be removed before publication as an RFC.

C.1.  Modifications between petithuguenin-behave-turn-uris-07 and
      petithuguenin-behave-turn-uris-06

   o  Updated the applications/protocols entry in the scheme
      registration form.

   o  Merged the first and last paragraphs of the security section.

   o  Repeated the description of what turn/turns URIs actually identify
      in the semantics section so it is reachable from the URI
      registration.
