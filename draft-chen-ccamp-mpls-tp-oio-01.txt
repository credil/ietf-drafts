  Multi-Protocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Operator
                           Identifier Object

Abstract

   Two formats of operator identifier are specified in Multi-Protocol
   Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) networks, to uniquely
   identify an operator.  One is Global_ID, the other is
   ICC_Operator_ID.  In MPLS-TP networks, operator identifier as part of
   the global identifier of an MPLS-TP LSP may be required to be carried
   in the Path/Resv message when setting up the LSP.

   This document defines a new RSVP-TE Object: Operator Identifier
   object (OIO).  It has two types, the Global_ID object and the
   ICC_Operator_ID object.  Similar as Session and Sender Template
   object, OIO could be carried in the Path or Resv message to
   communicate the Operator ID that the two ends of an LSP in use.  At
   the same time, it makes sure all the nodes that the LSP traverses to
   use the same format of Operator ID.

Internet-Draft         Operator Identifier Object           October 2011


1.  Introduction

   RFC6370 [RFC6370] specifies an initial set of identifiers to be used
   in the Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).
   The Global_ID is defined in RFC6370 [RFC6370] to uniquely identify an
   operator.  [I.D.draft-ietf-mpls-tp-itu-t-identifiers]
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-itu-t-identifiers] specifies the ICC_Operator_ID,
   an alternative way to uniquely identify an operator based on ITU-T
   conventions.  We call both Global_ID and ICC_Operator_ID as Operator
   ID in this document.  The Operator ID is used to provide a globally
   unique context for other MPLS-TP identifiers.

   Resource ReserVation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling
   [RFC3209][RFC3471] does not exchange Operator ID when setup an LSP.
   It is because in the traditional MPLS network the use of Operator ID
   is not necessary.  When the IP addresses is globally unique, a
   Traffic Engineering (TE) LSP could be uniquely identified by the
   source IP address, destination IP address, Tunnel ID and Label
   Switching Path (LSP) ID of the LSP, which are carried in the Session
   and Sender Template/Filter Spec object.  But in MPLS-TP networks, the
   Node Identifier (Node_ID) is unique within the scope of the Operator
   ID.  In situations where a Node_ID needs to be globally unique, this
   is accomplished by prefixing the identifier with the Operator ID.
   This means the Operator ID as part of the global identifier of an
   MPLS-TP LSP may be required to be carried in the Path/Resv message
   when setting up the LSP.

   In addition, since two formats of Operator ID are defined,
   i.e.Global_ID and ICC_Operator_ID, two things need to be determined
   when setting up a LSP in terms of Operator ID.  One is that which
   format should be used, the other is that how to make sure both ends
   of the LSP using the same format.  The former could be achieved by
   the configuration of the operators.  The later may need some
   signaling exchange.

   This document defines a new RSVP-TE object: Operator Identifier
   object (OIO).  It has two types, the Global_ID object and
   ICC_Operator_ID object.  Similar as the Session and Sender Template/
   Filter Spec object, OIO could be carried in the Path/Resv message to
   communicate the Operator ID that the two ends of an LSP in use.  At
   the same time, it makes sure all the nodes that the LSP traverses to
   use the same format of Operator ID.


2.  Operator Identifier Object

   Two types of Operator Identifier object (OIO) are defined in this
   document for two formats of Operator ID respectively: Global_ID

   object and ICC_Operator_ID object.  Both Global_ID and
   ICC_Operator_ID object are OPTIONAL.  When setting up an MPLS-TP LSP,
   one and only one type of the OIO MUST be included in the Path/Resv
   message if the Operator ID is required.

2.1.  Global_ID Object

   The encoding of the Global_ID object including the common object
   header is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            Length             | Class-Num (TBA)|   C-Type (1) |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                           Global_ID                           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Class-Num: To be allocated by IANA.

   C-Type: To be allocated by IANA (0x01 is recommended).

   Global_ID: Global_ID of the sender node.  As defined in RFC6370
   [RFC6370], a Global_ID is an unsigned 32-bit value and MUST be
   derived from a 4-octet AS number assigned to the operator.  Note that
   2-octet AS numbers have been incorporated in the 4-octet by placing
   the 2-octet AS number in the low-order octets and setting the two
   high-order octets to zero.

2.2.  ICC_Operator_ID Object

   The encoding of the ICC_Operator_ID object including the common
   object header is as follows:
       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            Length             | Class-Num (TBA)|   C-Type (2) |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                       ICC_Operator_ID                         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                       ICC_Operator_ID(contd.)                 |

Internet-Draft         Operator Identifier Object           October 2011


   ICC_Operator_ID: ICC_Operator_ID of the sender node.  As defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-itu-t-identifiers], the ICC_Operator_ID is formed
   by Country Code (CC) and ICC(ITU-T Carrier Code ) as CC::ICC.  The
   ICC itself is a string of one to six characters, global uniqueness is
   assured by concatenating the ICC with a CC.  The Country Code
   (alpha-2) is a string of two alphabetic characters represented with
   upper case letters (i.e., A-Z).  When the length of a ICC_Operator_ID
   string is less than 8 octets, the higher-order unused octets of the
   ICC_Operator_ID field MUST be set to zero.

2.3.  Procedures

   When signaling an MPLS-TP LSP, if the Operator ID is needed, e.g.
   LSRs on the LSP belong to different operators, the Operator
   Identifier object MUST be carried in the Path message, either the
   Global_ID or ICC_Operator_ID C-Type is used based on its local
   configuration.  The Global_ID or ICC_Operator_ID field is filled by
   the sender node's Global_ID or ICC_Operator_ID.  When receiving such
   a Path message with OIO object, the node MUST check it's C-Type to
   see whether it agree to use that format of Operator ID.  If the node
   agrees, it MUST use the same format of Operator ID.  The same C-Type
   of OIO MUST be carried in the Resv message, and the Global_ID or
   ICC_Operator_ID field is filled by its own Global_ID or
   ICC_Operator_ID.

   If the receiving node does not recognize the Operator Identifier
   object, it sends a PathErr message with the error code "Unknown
   object class" towards the sender.  If the receiving node recognizes
   the Operator Identifier object but does not recognize or support the
   C-Type, it sends a PathErr message with the error code "Unknown
   object C-Type" towards the sender.  If the receiving node, for any
   reason, is not able to use the same C-Type as sender, e.g. due to
   fault configuration or requested C-Type not enabled, it MUST send a
   PathErr message with the error code "Wrong Operator Identifier
   C-Type" to notify the sender (Error Code to be allocated by IANA),
   and the LSP is not set up.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document request IANA to assign new Class-Num, C-Types as
   follows:
   Class-Num     Class Name              Class Types or C-Types:
   ---------     -------------------     ------------------------
         TBD     Operator Identifier     0x01(TBD)   Global_ID
                                         0x02(TBD)   ICC_Operator_ID

   This document also request IANA to assign new Error-Code as follows:
   Error Code         Meaning
   ----------         -------------------------------
          TBD         Wrong Operator Identifier C-Type


4.  Security Considerations

   When Operator Identifier Object is in use, a form of source-
   validation checking may be enabled to ensure that the Global_ID or
   ICC_Operator_ID originated from a legitimate source, especially in
   the inter-provider case.
