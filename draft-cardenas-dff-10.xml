		<section title="Introduction">			
			<t>
				This document specifies the Depth-First Forwarding (DFF) protocol for IPv6 networks, both for IPv6 forwarding (<xref target="RFC2460"/>, henceforth denoted "route-over"), and also for "mesh-under" forwarding using the LoWPAN adaptation layer (<xref target="RFC4944"/>). The protocol operates entirely on the forwarding plane, but may interact with the routing plane. The purpose of DFF is to increase reliability of data delivery in networks with dynamic topologies and/or lossy links.
			</t>
			
			<t>
				DFF forwards data packets using a "depth-first search" for the destination of the packets. DFF relies on an external neighborhood discovery mechanism which lists neighbors of a router that may be attempted as next hops for a data packet. In addition, DFF may use information from the Routing Information Base (RIB) for deciding in which order to try to send the packet to the neighboring routers.
			</t>
			
			<t>
				If the packet makes no forward progress using the first selected next hop, DFF will successively try all neighbors of the router. If none of the next hops successfully receives or forwards the packet, DFF returns the packet to the previous hop, which in turn tries to send it to alternate neighbors.
			</t>
			
			<t>
				As network topologies do not necessarily form trees, loops can occur. Therefore, DFF contains a loop detection and avoidance mechanism.
			</t>
			
			<t>
				DFF may provide information, which may - by a mechanism outside of this specification - be used for updating cost of routes in the RIB based on failed or successful delivery of packets through alternative next hops. Such information may also be used by a routing protocol.
			</t>
			
			<t>
				DFF assumes that the underlying link layer provides means to detect if a packet has been successfully delivered to the next hop or not, is designed for networks with little traffic, and is used for unicast transmissions only.
			</t>
			
			
			<section title="Motivation">
				<t>
					In networks with dynamic topologies and/or lossy links, even frequent exchanges of control messages between routers for updating the routing tables cannot guarantee that the routes correspond to the effective topology of the network at all times. Packets may not be delivered to their destination because the topology has changed since the last routing protocol update.
				</t> 
				
				<t>
					More frequent routing protocol updates can mitigate that problem to a certain extent, however this requires additional signaling, consuming channel and router resources (e.g., when flooding control messages through the network). This is problematic in networks with lossy links, where further control traffic exchange can worsen the network stability because of collisions. Moreover, additional control traffic exchange may drain energy from battery-driven routers.
				</t>
				
				<t>
					The data-forwarding mechanism specified in this document allows for forwarding data packets along alternate paths for increasing reliability of data delivery, using a depth-first search. The objective is to decrease the necessary control traffic overhead in the network, and at the same time to increase delivery success rates.
				</t>
				
				<t>As this specification is intended for experimentation, the mechanism is also specified for forwarding on the LoWPAN adaption layer (according to Section 11 of <xref target="RFC4944"/>), in addition to IPv6 forwarding as specified in <xref target="RFC2460"/>.
				
				
				Other than different header formats, the DFF mechanism for  route-over and mesh-under is similar, and is therefore first defined in general, and then more specifically for both IPv6 route-over forwarding (as specified in <xref target="route_over_MoP"/>), and for LoWPAN adaptation layer mesh-under (as specified in <xref target="mesh_under_MoP"/>).</t>
			</section>
			
			<section title="Experiments to be conducted" anchor="experiments">
				<t>
					While this protocol has been widely deployed (as described in <xref target="deployments"/>), the IETF community is encouraged to perform experiments with it. In particular, the following information may be valuable to investigate:
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>
							Optimal values for the parameter P_HOLD_TIME, depending on the size of the network, the topology and the amount of traffic originated per router. The longer a Processed Tuple is hold, the more memory is consumed on a router. Moreover, if a tuple is hold too long, a sequence number wrap-around may occur, and a new packet may have the same sequence number as one indicated in an old Processed Tuple. 
							However, if the tuple is expired too soon (before the packet has been completed its path to the destination), it may be mistakenly detected as new packet instead of one already seen.
						</t>
						
						<t>
							Optimal values for the parameter MAX_HOP_LIMIT, depending on the size of the network, the topology, and the lossyness of the link layer. MAX_HOP_LIMIT makes sure that packets do not unnecessarily traverse in the network; it may be used to limit the "detour" of packets that is acceptable. The value may also be based on a per-packet-basis if hop-count information is available from the RIB or routing protocol. In such a case, the hop-limit for the packet may be a percentage (e.g., 200%) of the hop-count value indicated in the routing table.
						</t>
						
						<t>
							Optimal methods to increase cost of a route when a loop or lost L2 ACK is detected by DFF. While this is not specified as a normative part of this document, it may be of interest in an experiment to find good values of how much to increase link cost in the RIB or routing protocol.

		<section anchor="applicability" title="Applicability Statement">
			<t>
				This document specifies DFF, a packet forwarding mechanism intended for use in networks with dynamic topology and/or lossy links with the purpose of increasing reliability of data delivery. The protocol's  applicability is determined by its characteristics, which are that
   this protocol:
			
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>
						Is applicable for use in IPv6 networks, either as "route-over" forwarding mechanism using IPv6 (<xref target="RFC2460"/>), or as "mesh-under" forwarding mechanism using the frame format for transmission of IPv6 packets defined in <xref target="RFC4944"/>.
					</t>
					
					<t>
						Assumes addresses used in the network are either IPv6 addresses (if the protocol is used as "route-over"), or 16-bit short or EUI-64 link layer addresses, as specified in <xref target="RFC4944"/> if the protocol is used as "mesh-under". In "mesh-under" mode, mixed 16-bit and EUI-64 addresses within one DFF routing domain are allowed (if conform with <xref target="RFC4944"/>), as long as DFF is limited to be used within one PAN. It is assumed that the "route-over" mode and "mesh-under" mode are mutually exclusive in the same routing domain.
					</t>
					
					
					<t>
						Assumes that the underlying link layer provides means to detect if a Packet has been successfully delivered to the Next Hop or not (e.g., by L2 ACK messages).
					</t>
					
					<t>
						Is designed to work in networks with lossy links and/or with a dynamic topology. In networks with very stable links (e.g. Ethernet) and fixed topology, DFF will not bring any benefit (but also not be harmful, other than the additional overhead for the Packet header). 
					</t>
				
					
					<t>
						Is designed to work in a completely distributed manner, and does not depend on any central entity.
					</t>
					
					<t>
						Is designed for networks with little traffic in terms of numbers of Packets per second, since each recently forwarded Packet increases the state on a router. The amount of traffic per time that is supported by DFF depends on the memory resources of the router running DFF, on the density of the network, on the loss rate of the channel, and the maximum hop limit for each Packet: for each recently seen Packet, a list of Next Hops that the Packet has been sent to is stored in memory. The stored entries can be deleted after an expiration time, so that only recently received Packets require storage on the router.
					</t>
					
					<t>
						Is designed for dense topologies with multiple paths between each source and each destination. Certain topologies are less suitable for DFF: topologies that can be partitioned by the removal of a single router or link, topologies with multiple stub routers that each have a single link to the network, topologies with only a single path to a destination, or topologies where the "detour" that a Packet makes during the depth-first search in order to reach the destination would be too long. Note that the number of retransmissions of a Packet that stipulate a "too long" path depends on the underlying link layer (capacity and probability of Packet loss), as well as how much bandwidth is required for data traffic by applications running in the network.
						In such topologies, the Packet may never reach the Destination, and therefore unnecessary transmissions of data Packets may occur until the Hop Limit of the Packet reaches zero and the Packet is dropped. This may consume channel and router resources.
					</t>
					
					<t>
						Is used for unicast transmissions only (not for anycast or multicast).
					</t>
					
					<t>
						Is optimized for use within stub networks, and for traffic between a router inside the routing domain in which DFF is used and a known border router. Examples of such networks are LoWPANs. While the mechanism can also be used for transit network, additional IP encapsulation is required, as specified in <xref target="scope_limitation"/>.

		<section anchor="overview" title="Protocol Overview and Functioning">
			<t>
				When a Packet is to be forwarded by a router using DFF, the router creates a list of candidate Next Hops for that Packet. This list is ordered, first containing Next Hops listed in the RIB, if available, ordered in increasing cost, followed by other neighbors provided by an external neighborhood discovery. DFF proceeds to forward the Packet to the Next Hop listed first in the list. If the transmission was not successful (as determined by the underlying link layer) or if the Packet was "returned" by a Next Hop to which it had been sent before, the router will try to forward the Packet to the next Next Hop on the list. A router "returns" a Packet to the router from which it was originally received, once it has unsuccessfully tried to forward the Packet to all elements in the candidate Next Hop list. If the Packet is eventually returned to the Originator of the Packet, it is dropped. 
			</t>

			<t>
				For each recently forwarded Packet, a router running DFF stores the list of Next Hops to which a Packet has been sent. Packets are identified by a sequence number that is included in the Packet Header. This list of recently forwarded Packets also allows for avoiding loops when forwarding a Packet. Entries of the list (identified by a sequence number of a Packet) expire after a given expiration timeout, and are removed. 
			</t>
			
			
			<section title="Information Sets Overview">
   
				<t>
					This specification requires a single set on each router, the Processed Set. Moreover, a list of bidirectional neighbors must be provided by an external neighborhood discovery mechanism, or may be determined from the RIB (e.g., if the RIB provides routes to adjacent routers, and if these one-hop routes are verified to be bidirectional). The Processed Set stores the sequence number, the Originator Address, the Previous Hop and a list of Next Hops, to which the Packet has been sent, for each recently seen Packet. Entries in the set are removed after a predefined time-out. Each time a Packet is forwarded to a Next Hop, that Next Hop is added to the list of Next Hops of the entry for the Packet.
				</t>
				
				<t>Note that an implementation of this protocol may maintain
the information of the Processed Set in the indicated form, or in any other organization which offers access to this information.  In particular, it
is not necessary to remove Tuples from a Set at the exact time indicated, only to behave as if the Tuples were removed at that time.</t>

			</section>
			
			
			<section title="Signaling Overview">
				<t>
					DFF requires additional header information in each data Packet by a router using this specification. This information is stored in a Packet Header that is specified in this document as LoWPAN header and as IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options extension header respectively, for the intended "route-over" and "mesh-under" Modes of Operations. This DFF header contains a sequence number used for uniquely identifying a Packet, and two flags: RET (for "return") and DUP (for "duplicated").
				</t>
				
				<t> 
					While a router successively tries sending a data Packet to one or more of its neighbors, RET = 0. If none of the transmissions of the Packet to the neighbors of a router have succeeded, the Packet is returned to the Previous Hop, indicated by setting the return flag (RET := 1). The RET flag is required to discern between a deliberately returned Packet and a looping Packet: if a router receives a Packet with RET = 1 (and DUP = 0 or DUP = 1) that it has already forwarded, the Packet was deliberately returned, and the router will continue to successively send the Packet to routers from the candidate Next Hop list. If that Packet has RET = 0, the router assumes that the Packet is looping and returns it to the Previous Hop. An external mechanism may use this information for increasing the route cost of the route to the Destination using the Next Hop which resulted in the loop in the RIB. Alternatively, or in addition, the routing protocol may be informed.
				</t>
			
				<t>
					Whenever a Packet transmission to a neighbor has failed (as determined by the underlying link layer, e.g., using L2 ACKs), the duplicate (DUP) flag is set in the Packet Header for the following transmissions. The rationale is that the Packet may have been successfully received by the neighbor and only the L2 ACK has been lost, resulting in possible duplicates of the Packet in the network. The DUP flag tags such a possible duplicate. The DUP flag is required to discern between a duplicated Packet and a looping Packet: if a router receives a Packet with DUP = 1 (and RET = 0) that it has already forwarded, the Packet is not considered looping, and successively forwarded to the next router from the candidate Next Hop list. If the received Packet has DUP = 0 (and RET = 0), the router assumes that the Packet is looping, sets RET := 1, and returns it to the Previous Hop. Again, an external mechanism may use this information for increasing route costs and/or informing the routing protocol.
				</t>
			</section>

		</section>
		
		
		<section title="Protocol Dependencies">
				<t>
					DFF MAY use information from the Routing Information Base (RIB), specifically for determining an order of preference for to which next hops a packet should be forwarded (e.g., the packet may be forwarded first to neighbors that are listed in the RIB as next hops to the destination, preferring those with the lowest route cost).

		<section anchor="getnexthop" title="Determining the Next Hop for a Packet">
			<t>
				When forwarding a Packet, a router determines a valid Next Hop for that Packet as specified in this section. As a Processed Tuple was either existing when receiving the Packet (henceforth denoted the "current Packet"), or otherwise was created, it can be assumed the a Processed Tuple for that Packet (henceforth denoted the "current tuple") is available. 
			</t>
			
			<t>
				The Next Hop is chosen from a list of candidate Next Hops in order of decreasing priority. This list is created per Packet. 
The maximum candidate Next Hop List for a Packet contains all the neighbors of the router (as determined from an external neighborhood discovery process), except for the Previous Hop of the current Packet. A smaller list MAY be used, if desired, and the exact selection of the size of the candidate Next Hop List is a local decision in each router, which does not affect interoperability. If information from the RIB is used, then the candidate Next Hop list MUST contain at least the Next Hop, indicated in the RIB as the Next Hop on the shortest path to the destination, and SHOULD contain all Next Hops, indicated to the RIB as Next Hops on paths to the destination. If a Next Hop from the RIB equals the Previous Hop of the current Packet, it MUST NOT be added to the candidate Next Hop list, and the RIB MAY be informed about a potential loop as specified in <xref target="poison"/>.</t>

			<t>				
				The list MUST NOT contain Addresses which are listed in P_next_hop_neighbor_list of the current tuple, in order to avoid sending the Packet to the same neighbor multiple times. Moreover, an Address MUST NOT appear more than once in the list, for the same reason. Also, Addresses of an interface of this router MUST NOT be added to the list.</t>
				
			<t>The list has an order of preference, where Next Hops at the top of the list being the ones that Packets are sent to first in the depth-first processing specified in <xref target="packet_generation"/> and <xref target="packet_processing"/>. The following order is RECOMMENDED, with the elements listed on top having the highest preference:
				<list style="numbers">
					<t>The neighbor that is indicated in the RIB as the Next Hop on the shortest path to the destination of the current Packet;</t>
					<t>Other neighbors indicated in the RIB as Next Hops on path to the destination of the current Packet;</t>
					<t>All other bidirectional neighbors (except the Previous Hop of the current Packet).</t>
				</list>
				
				Additional information from the RIB or the list of bidirectional neighbors MAY be used for determining the order, such as route cost or link quality.
			</t>
			
			<t>
				If the candidate Next Hop list created as specified in this section is empty, the selected Next Hop MUST be P_prev_hop of the current tuple; this case applies when returning the Packet to the Previous Hop.

		<section anchor="poison" title="Informing the Routing Protocol">
			<t>
				When a Packet is returned (i.e., a Packet with RET = 1 is received by a router) or a link layer acknowledgment (ACK) has not been received for a forwarded Packet, an external mechanism (not specified in this document) MAY use this information to increase the cost for the route in the RIB, and/or to inform the routing protocol. In particular, DFF can inform a routing protocol if a Packet is received by a router that has been received before (as indicated by an existing Processed Tuple), and DUP = 0 and RET = 0, which indicates a loop in the routing topology.
				Care has to be taken by this external mechanism not to create loops. The rationale for such a mechanism is to update routes based on information from DFF, so that future packet transmissions will take better routes.

		</section>
		
		
		<section anchor="seqno" title="Sequence Numbers">
			<t>
				Whenever a router generates a Packet or forwards a Packet on behalf of a host or a router outside the routing domain where DFF is used, a sequence number MUST be created and included in the DFF header. This sequence number MUST be unique locally on each router where it is created. A sequence number MUST start at 0 for the first Packet to which the DFF header is added, and then increase in steps of 1 for each new Packet. The sequence number MUST NOT be greater than 65535 and MUST wrap around to 0.

Destination Headers are only read by the destination of an IPv6 packet, not by intermediate routers. However, the mechanism specified in this document relies on intermediate routers reading and editing the header. Specifically, the sequence number and the DUP and RET flags are read by each router running the DFF protocol. Modifying the DUP flag and RET flag is essential for this protocol to tag duplicate or returned Packets. Without the DUP flag, a duplicate Packet cannot be discerned from a looping Packet, and without the RET flag, a returned Packet cannot be discerned from a looping Packet.

			<section anchor="scope_limitation_route_over" title="Route-Over MoP">
				<t>
					In <xref target="scope-1"/>, both the source and destination of the traffic are routers within the routing domain. If traffic is originated at S, the DFF header is added to the IPv6 header (as specified in <xref target="route_over_MoP_packet_format"/>). The Originator Address is set to S and the Destination Address is set to D. The Packet is forwarded to D using this specification. When router D receives the Packet, it processes the payload of the IPv6 Packet in upper layers. This case assumes that S has knowledge that D is in the routing domain, e.g., because of administrative setting based on the IP address of the Destination. If S has no knowledge about whether D is in the routing domain, IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnels as specified in <xref target="RFC2473"/> MUST be used. These cases are described in the following paragraphs.
				</t>
				
				<t>
					In <xref target="scope-2"/>, the source of the traffic (S) is within the routing domain, and the destination (D) is outside of the routing domain. The IPv6 Packet, originated at S, MUST be encapsulated according to <xref target="RFC2473"/> (IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnels), and the DFF header added to the outer IPv6 header. S chooses the next router that should process the Packet as the tunnel exit-point.  In some cases, the tunnel exit-point will be the final router along a path towards the Packet's Destination, and the Packet will only traverse a single tunnel (e.g., if R is a known border router then S can choose R as tunnel exit-point).  In other cases, the tunnel exit-point will not be the final router along the path to D, and the Packet may traverse multiple tunnels to reach the Destination; note that in this case, the DFF mechanism is only used inside each IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel. If no information is available which router to choose as tunnel exit-point, the Next Hop MUST be used as tunnel exit-point.

					The Originator Address of the Packet is set to S and the Destination Address is set to the tunnel exit-point (in the outer IPv6 header). The Packet is forwarded to the tunnel exit-point using this specification (potentially using multiple consecutive IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnels). When router R receives the Packet, it decapsulates the IPv6 Packet and forwards the inner IPv6 Packet to D, using normal IPv6 forwarding as specified in <xref target="RFC2460"/>.
				</t>
				
				<t>
					In <xref target="scope-3"/>, the source of the traffic (S) is outside of the routing domain, and the destination (D) is inside of the routing domain. 
					The IPv6 Packet, originated at S, is forwarded to R using normal IPv6 forwarding as specified in <xref target="RFC2460"/>. Router R MUST encapsulate the IPv6 Packet according to <xref target="RFC2473"/>, and add the DFF header (as specified in <xref target="route_over_MoP_packet_format"/>) to the outer IPv6 header. Like in the previous case, R has to select a tunnel exit-point; if it knows that D is in the routing domain (e.g., based on administrative settings), it SHOULD select D as the tunnel exit-point. In case it does not have any information which exit-point to select, it MUST use the Next Hop as tunnel exit-point, limiting the effectiveness of DFF to inside each IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel.
					
					The Originator Address of the Packet is set to R, the Destination Address to the tunnel exit-point (both in the outer IPv6 header), the sequence number in the DFF header is generated locally on R. The Packet is forwarded to D using this specification. When router D receives the Packet, it decapsulates the inner IPv6 Packet and processes the payload of the inner IPv6 Packet in upper layers.
				</t>
				
				<t>
					In <xref target="scope-4"/>, both the source of the traffic (S) and the destination (D) are outside of the routing domain. The IPv6 Packet, originated at S, is forwarded to R1 using normal IPv6 forwarding as specified in <xref target="RFC2460"/>. Router R1 MUST encapsulate the IPv6 Packet according to <xref target="RFC2473"/> and add the DFF header (as specified in <xref target="route_over_MoP_packet_format"/>). R1 selects a tunnel exit-point like in the previous cases; if R2 is, e.g., a known border router, then R1 can select R2 as tunnel exit-point.
		
					The Originator Address is set to R1, the Destination Address to the tunnel exit-point (both in the outer IPv6 header), the sequence number in the DFF header is generated locally on R1. The Packet is forwarded to the tunnel exit-point using this specification (potentially traversing multiple consecutive IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnels). When router R2 receives the Packet, it decapsulates the inner IPv6 Packet and forwards the inner IPv6 Packet to D, using normal IPv6 forwarding as specified in <xref target="RFC2460"/>.

			<section anchor="scope_limitation_mesh_under" title="Mesh-Under MoP">
				<t>
					In <xref target="scope-1"/>, both the source and destination of the traffic are routers within the routing domain. If  traffic is originated at router S, the LoWPAN encapsulated Packet is created from the IPv6 packet as specified in <xref target="RFC4944"/>. Then, the Mesh Addressing header and the DFF header (as specified in <xref target="mesh_under_MoP_packet_format"/>) are added to the LoWPAN encapsulation on router S. The Originator Address is set to S and the Destination Address is set to D. The Packet is then forwarded using this specification. When router D receives the Packet, it processes the payload of the Packet in upper layers.
				</t>
				
				<t>
					In <xref target="scope-2"/>, the source of the traffic (S) is within the routing domain, and the destination (D) is outside of the routing domain (which is known by S to be outside the routing domain because D uses a different IP prefix from the PAN). The LoWPAN encapsulated Packet, originated at router S, is created from the IPv6 packet as specified in <xref target="RFC4944"/>. Then, the Mesh Addressing header and the DFF header (as specified in <xref target="mesh_under_MoP_packet_format"/>) are added to the LoWPAN encapsulation on router S. The Originator Address is set to S and the Destination Address is set to R, which is a known border router of the PAN.				
					The Packet is then forwarded using this specification. When router R receives the Packet, it restores the IPv6 packet from the LoWPAN encapsulated Packet and forwards it to D, using normal IPv6 forwarding as specified in <xref target="RFC2460"/>.
				</t>
				
				<t>
					In <xref target="scope-3"/>, the source of the traffic (S) is outside of the routing domain, and the destination (D) is inside of the routing domain. The IPv6 packet, originated at S, is forwarded to R using normal IPv6 forwarding as specified in <xref target="RFC2460"/>. Router R (which is a known border router to the PAN) creates the LoWPAN encapsulated Packet from the IPv6 packet as specified in <xref target="RFC4944"/>. Then, R adds the Mesh Addressing header and the DFF header (as specified in <xref target="mesh_under_MoP_packet_format"/>). The Originator Address is set to R, the Destination Address to D, the sequence number in the DFF header is generated locally on R. The Packet is forwarded to D using this specification. When router D receives the Packet, it restores the IPv6 packet from the LoWPAN encapsulated Packet and processes the payload in upper layers.
				</t>
				
				<t> As LoWPANs are typically no transit networks, this case is unusual, but described nevertheless for completeness:
					In <xref target="scope-4"/>, both the source of the traffic (S) and the destination (D) are outside of the routing domain.  The IPv6 packet, originated at S, is forwarded to R1 using normal IPv6 forwarding as specified in <xref target="RFC2460"/>. Router R1 (which is a known border router of the PAN) creates the LoWPAN encapsulated Packet from the IPv6 Packet as specified in <xref target="RFC4944"/>. Then, it adds the Mesh Addressing header and the DFF header (as specified in <xref target="mesh_under_MoP_packet_format"/>). The Originator Address is set to R1, the Destination Address to R2 (which is another border router towards the Destination), the sequence number in the DFF header is generated locally on R1. The Packet is forwarded to R2 using this specification. When router R2 receives the Packet, it restores the IPv6 packet from the LoWPAN encapsulated Packet and forwards the IPv6 packet to D, using normal IPv6 forwarding as specified in <xref target="RFC2460"/>.

			<t>
				Based on the recommendations in <xref target="RFC3552"/>, this section describes security threats to DFF, lists which attacks are out of scope, which attacks DFF is susceptible to, and which attacks DFF protects against.
			</t>
			
			<section anchor="security_out_of_scope" title="Attacks Out of Scope">
				<t>
					As DFF is a data forwarding protocol, any security issues concerning the payload of the Packets are not considered in this section.
				</t>
				<t>
					It is the responsibility of upper layers to use appropriate security mechanisms (IPsec, TLS, ...) according to application requirements. As DFF does not modify the contents of IP datagrams, other than the DFF header (which is a Hop-by-Hop Options extension header in the "route-over" MoP, and therefore not protected by IPsec), no special considerations for IPsec have to be addressed.
				</t>
				<t>
					Any attack that is not specific to DFF, but that applies in general to the link layer (e.g., wireless, PLC), is out of scope. In particular, these attacks are: Eavesdropping, Packet insertion, Packet replaying, Packet deletion, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Appropriate link-layer encryption can mitigate part of these attacks and is therefore RECOMMENDED.

					DFF itself does not provide any additional integrity, confidentiality or authentication. Therefore, the level of protection of DFF depends on the underlying link layer security as well as protection of the payload by upper layer security (e.g., IPsec).
				</t>
				<t>
					In the following sections, whenever encrypting or digitally signing Packets is suggested for protecting DFF, it is assumed that routers are not compromised.
				</t>
    		
    		</section>

			
			
			<section anchor="security_in_of_scope" title="Attacks In Scope">
				<t>
					This section discusses security threats to DFF, and for each describes whether (and how) DFF is affected by the threat. 
					DFF is designed to be used in lossy and unreliable networks. Predominant examples of lossy networks are wireless networks, where routers send Packets via broadcast. The attacks listed below are easier to exploit in wireless media, but can also be observed in wired networks.
				</t>

				<section anchor="security_DoS" title="Denial of Service">
					<t>
						Denial of Service attacks are possible when using DFF by either exceeding the storage on a router, or by exceeding the available bandwidth of the channel. As DFF does not contain any algorithms with high complexity, it is unlikely that the processing power of the router could be exhausted by an attack on DFF.
					</t>
					<t>
						The storage of a router can be exhausted by increasing the size of the Processed Set, i.e., by adding new tuples, or by increasing the size of each tuple. New tuples can be added by injecting new Packets in the network, or by forwarding overheard Packets.
					</t>
					<t>
						Another possible DoS attack is to send Packets to a non-existing Address in the network. DFF would perform a depth-first search until the Hop Limit has reached zero. Is is therefore RECOMMENDED to set the Hop Limit to a value that limits the path length.
					</t>
					<t>
						If security provided by the link layer is used, this attack can be mitigated if the malicious router does not possess valid credentials, since other routers would not forward data through the malicious router.
					</t>		
				</section>
				
				
				
				<section anchor="security_modification" title="Packet Header Modification">
					<t>
						The following attacks can be exploited by modifying the Packet Header information, unless additional security (such as link layer security) is used:
					</t>
	
					<section anchor="security_return_flag" title="Return Flag Tampering">
						<t>
							A malicious router may tamper the "return" flag of a DFF Packet, and send it back to the previous hop, but only if that router had been selected as next hop by the receiving router before (as specified in <xref target="packet_processing"/>). If the malicious router had not been selected as next hop, then a returned Packet is dropped by the receiving router.
							If, otherwise, the malicious router had been selected as next hop by the receiving router, and the malicious router has set the return flag, the receiving router would then try alternative neighbors. This may lead to Packets never reaching their Destination, as well as unnecessary depth-first search in the network (bandwidth exhaustion / energy drain).
						</t>
						<t>
							This attack can be mitigated by using appropriate security of the underlying link layer.
						</t>
					</section>
				
					<section anchor="security_dup_flag" title="Duplicate Flag Tampering">
						<t>
							A malicious router may modify the Duplicate Flag of a Packet that it forwards. 
						</t>
						<t>
							If it changes the flag from 0 to 1, the Packet would be detected as duplicate by other routers in the network and not as looping packet. This may have an impact on route repair mechanisms, if an external mechanism as described in <xref target="poison"/> is used.
						</t>
						<t>
							If the Duplicate Flag is set from 1 to 0, and a router receives that Packet for the second time (i.e., it has already received a Packet with the same Originator Address and sequence number before), it will wrongly detect a loop. This may have an impact on route repair mechanisms, if an external mechanism as described in <xref target="poison"/> is used.
						</t>
						<t>
							This attack can be mitigated by using appropriate security of the underlying link layer.
						</t>	
					
					</section>
					
					
					<section anchor="security_seqno" title="Sequence Number Tampering">
						<t>
							A malicious router may modify the sequence number of a Packet that it forwards. 
						</t>
						<t>
							In particular, if the sequence number is modified to a number of another, previously sent, Packet of the same Originator, this Packet may wrongly be perceived as looping packet. This may have an impact on route repair mechanisms, if an external mechanism as described in <xref target="poison"/> is used.
						</t>
						<t>
							This attack can be mitigated by using appropriate security of the underlying link layer.

				DFF has been deployed and experimented with both in real deployments and in network simulations, as described in the following.
			</t>
			
			<section anchor="Japan" title="Deployments in Japan">
				<t>
					The majority of the large Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) deployments using DFF are located in Japan, but the data of these networks is property of Japanese utilities and cannot be disclosed.
				</t>
			</section>
			
			<section anchor="KitCarson" title="Kit Carson Electric Cooperative">
				<t>
					DFF has been deployed at Kit Carson Electric Cooperative (KCEC), a non-profit organization distributing electricity to about 30,000 customers in New Mexico. As described in a press release <xref target="KCEC_press_release"/>, DFF is running on currently about 2000 electric meters. All meters are connected through a mesh network using an unreliable, wireless medium. DFF is used together with a distance vector routing protocol. Metering data from each meter is sent towards a gateway periodically every 15 minutes. The data delivery reliability is over 99%.
				</t>
			</section>
			
			
			<section anchor="Simulations" title="Simulations">
				<t>
					DFF has been evaluated in Ns2 and OMNEST simulations, in conjunction with a distance vector routing protocol. The performance of DFF has been compared to using only the routing protocol without DFF. The results published in peer-reviewed academic papers (<xref target="DFF_paper1"/><xref target="DFF_paper2"/>) show significant improvements of the Packet delivery ratio compared to using only the distance vector protocol.
				</t>

			<section anchor="OpenSource" title="Open Source Implementation">
				<t>
					Fujitsu Laboratories of America is currently working on an open source implementation of DFF, which is to be released in early 2013, and which allows for interoperability testings of different DFF implementations. The implementation is written in Java, and can be used both on real machines and in the Ns2 simulator.
