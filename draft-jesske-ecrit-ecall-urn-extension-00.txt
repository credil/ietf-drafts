1.  Overall Applicability

   Uniform Resource Name (URN) for emergency and other Well-Known
   Services are well defined within IETF RFC 5031.  There are also
   existing proposals for automatic and manual ecall IN-Vehicles which
   defines their own URN's and additional procedures for vehicle
   specific eCalls.  Due to the existing telecommunication world and
   their implementations a combination of both is needed.  Due to the
   fact that only one URN can be used within the request line of a SIP
   Message a new approach is needed.  Therefore this document proposes
   to extend the existing URN's with an extension to reflect this.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Overview

   RFC5031[RFC5031] defines URN values for emergency calls.  The values
   for the SOS subtree are sos.ambulance, sos.animal-control, sos.fire,

Internet-Draft                                                 June 2013


   sos.gas, sos.marine, sos.mountain , sos.physician, sos.poison and
   sos.police and draft-rosen-ecrit-
   ecall-08.txt[draft-rosen-ecrit-ecall-08.txt] proposes two additional
   URN for ecall. automatic and ecall.manual the sub-services 'sos' as
   specified in Section 4.2 of RFC5031 [RFC5031].

   Within the existing implementation in GSM networks for emergency call
   as specified in 3GPP TS 22.101 [TS22101] the following requirements
   and code points are described:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   ---

   It shall be possible to initiate emergency calls to different
   emergency call centres, depending on the type of emergency.  The
   following types of emergency calls shall be possible:

   o  Police

   o  Ambulance

   o  Fire Brigade

   o  Marine Guard

   o  Mountain Rescue

   o  Manually Initiated eCall

   o  Automatically Initiated eCall

   ....

   It shall be possible to tie any emergency call number to any single
   emergency call type or to any combination of emergency call types.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------

   This means in practise that a emergency Call Center from police must
   differentiate between automatic and manual eCalls.  Same belongs to
   the other types like fire brigade Marine Guard ect.

   Requirement:

   Req-1: It shall be possible to tie a manually initiated eCall with
   different type of emergency type i.e. Police, Ambulance, Fire
   Brigade, Marine Guard and Mountain Rescue.

   Req-2:It shall be possible to tie a automatically initiated eCall
   with different type of emergency type i.e. Police, Ambulance, Fire
   Brigade, Marine Guard and Mountain Rescue.

4.  IANA Consideration

   Within RFC 5031 [RFC5031] the service URN is completely describes.
   The syntax is expendable therefore.  This document extends the sub-
   service URN for SOS described within Section 4.2 in RFC5031 [RFC5031]
   with an additional sub-label as described within section 4.1

4.1.  New Service-Identifying Labels

   Services and sub-services are identified by labels managed by IANA.
   RFC5031 [RFC5031] defines and registers the following formats:


      Service  Reference  Description
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
      foo      RFCxyz     Brief description of the 'foo' top-level service
      foo.bar  RFCabc     Description of the 'foo.bar' service




   This document registers an additional sub-label for the sos service
   URN.

   Entries in the registration table have the following format:


      Service       Reference  Description
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      foo.bar       RFCabc     Description of the 'foo.bar' service
      foo.bar.sub   RFCabc     Description of the 'foo.bar.sub' extended service



4.2.  sublabel for sos service and the relarted subservices

   An additional sublabels for 5 values are defined.

   .automatic

   This sublevel indicates that an eCall had been triggered
   automatically.  This could be a sensor-controlled measuring of heat
   or pressure in case of car accidents or fire situations.

   .manual

   This sublevel indicates that an eCall had been triggered based on the
   manual interaction of a person.

4.3.  IANA Registration


      Service                   Reference  Description

      sos.marine.manual         RFC 5031   Maritime search and rescue, manual eCall
      sos.mountain.automatic    RFC 5031   Mountain rescue, automatic eCall
      sos.mountain.manual       RFC 5031   Mountain rescue, manual eCall



5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise security considerations beyond those
   described in RFC5031 [RFC5031].

6.  Contributors and Acknowledgements

   The author would like to thank Dieter Jacobsohn, Maik Kirsch and
   Thoms Dennert for clarifying the requirements on automatic and manual
   eCall in the existing GSM world.
