Internet-Draft                  STUN URI                  September 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Session Traversal Utilities
   for NAT (STUN) protocol.

   STUN is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in
   dealing with Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal.  It can be
   used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to
   it by a NAT, to perform connectivity checks between two endpoints,
   and used as a keepalive protocol to maintain NAT bindings.  RFC 5389
   [RFC5389] defines the specifics of the STUN protocol.

   The "stun" and "stuns" URI schemes are used to designate a standalone
   STUN server or any Internet host performing the operations of a STUN
   server in the context of STUN usages (Section 14 RFC 5389 [RFC5389]).
   With the advent of standards such as WEBRTC [WEBRTC], we anticipate a
   plethora of endpoints and web applications to be able to identify and
   communicate with such a STUN server to carry out the STUN protocol.
   This also implies those endpoints and/or applications to be
   provisioned with appropriate configuration required to identify the
   STUN server.  Having an inconsistent syntax has its drawbacks and can
   result in non-interoperable solutions.  It can result in solutions
   that are ambiguous and have implementation limitations on the
   different aspects of the syntax and alike.  The 'stun/stuns' URI
   scheme helps alleviate most of these issues by providing a consistent
   way to describe, configure and exchange the information identifying a
   STUN server.  This would also prevent the shortcomings inherent with
   encoding similar information in non-uniform syntaxes such as the ones
   proposed in the WEBRTC Standards [WEBRTC], for example.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Definition of the STUN or STUNS URI

3.1.  URI Scheme Syntax

   The "stun" URI takes the following form (the example below is non-
   normative):

      stun:<stun-host>:<stun-port>





Nandakumar, et al.       Expires March 17, 2013                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  STUN URI                  September 2012


      stuns:<stun-host>:<stun-port>

   Note that the <port> part and the preceding ":" (colon) character, is
   OPTIONAL.

   A STUN/STUNS URI has the following formal ABNF syntax [RFC5234]:

   stunURI       = scheme ":" stun-host [ ":" stun-port ]
   scheme        = "stun" / "stuns"
   stun-host     = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name
   stun-port     = *DIGIT
   IP-literal    = "[" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture  ) "]"
   IPvFuture     = "v" 1*HEXDIG "." 1*( unreserved / sub-delims / ":" )
   IPv6address   =                              6( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   /                       "::" 5( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [               h16 ] "::" 4( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *1( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 3( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *2( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 2( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *3( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"    h16 ":"   ls32
                   / [ *4( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              ls32
                   / [ *5( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              h16
                   / [ *6( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"
   h16           = 1*4HEXDIG
   ls32          = ( h16 ":" h16 ) / IPv4address
   IPv4address   = dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet
   dec-octet     = DIGIT                 ; 0-9
                   / %x31-39 DIGIT       ; 10-99
                   / "1" 2DIGIT          ; 100-199
                   / "2" %x30-34 DIGIT   ; 200-249
                   / "25" %x30-35        ; 250-255
   reg-name      = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )

   <unreserved>, <sub-delims>, and <pct-encoded> are specified in
   [RFC3986].  The core rules <DIGIT> and <HEXDIGIT> are used as
   described in Appendix B of RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

3.2.  URI Scheme Semantics

   The STUN protocol supports sending messages over UDP, TCP or TLS-
   over-TCP.  The "stuns" URI scheme MUST be used when STUN is run over
   TLS-over-TCP (or in the future DTLS-over-UDP) and the "stun" scheme
   MUST be used otherwise.

   The required <stun-host> part of the "stun" URI denotes the STUN
   server host.

   For the optional DNS Discovery procedure mentioned in the Section 9
   of RFC5389, "stun" URI scheme implies UDP as the transport protocol

Internet-Draft                  STUN URI                  September 2012


   for SRV lookup and "stuns" URI scheme indicates TCP as the transport
   protocol.

   The <stun-port> part, if present, denotes the port on which the STUN
   server is awaiting connection requests.  If it is absent, the default
   port is 3478 for both UDP and TCP.  The default port for STUN over
   TLS is 5349 as per Section 9 of RFC 5389 [RFC5389].


4.  Security Considerations

   The "stun" and "stuns" URI schemes do not introduce any specific
   security issues beyond the security considerations discussed in
   [RFC3986].

Appendix B.  Design Notes

   o  One recurring comment was to stop using the suffix "s" on URI
      scheme, and to move the secure option to a parameter (e.g.
      ";proto=tls").  We decided against this idea because the need of
      ";proto=" for the STUN URI cannot be sufficiently explained and
      supporting it would render into an incomplete specification.  This
      would also result in loosing symmetry between the TURN and STUN
      URIs.  A more detailed account of the reasoning behind this is
      available at <http://blog.marc.petit-huguenin.org/2012/09/
      on-design-of-stun-and-turn-uri-formats.html>
