1.  Introduction

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] provides a means 
   for an offerer to describe the specifics of a session to an 
   answerer, and for the answerer to respond back with its session 
   specifics to the offerer.  These session specifics include offering 
   the codec or codecs to choose from, the specific IP address and port
   number the offerer wants to receive the RTP stream(s) on/at, the 
   particulars about the codecs the offerer wants considered or 
   mandated, and so on.  

   There are many facets within SDP to determine the Real-time 
   Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] details for the session 
   establishment between one or more endpoints, but identifying how the
   underlying network should process each stream still remains 
   under-specified. 



Polk, et al.              Expires Aug 18, 2013                 [Page 2]

   The ability to identify a traffic flow by port number gives an 
   indication to underlying network elements to treat traffic with 
   dissimilar ports in a different way, the same or in groups the same 
   - but different from other ports or groups of ports.

   Within the context of realtime communications, the labeling of an 
   RTP session based on media descriptor lines as just a voice and/or 
   video session is insufficient, and provides no guidelines to the 
   underlying network on how to treat the traffic. A more granular 
   labeling helps on several fronts to

   - inform application layer elements in the signaling path the 
     intent of this session.

   - inform the network on how to treat the traffic if the network is 
     configured to differentiate session treatments based on the type 
     of session the RTP is, including the ability to provide call 
     admission control based on the type of traffic in the network.

   - allow network monitoring/management of traffic types realtime and
     after-the-fact analysis.

   Some network operators want the ability to guarantee certain traffic
   gets a minimum amount of network bandwidth per link or through a 
   series of links that make up a network such as a campus or WAN, or a
   backbone. For example, a call center voice application might get at 
   least 20% of the available link bandwidth.

   Some network operators want the ability to allow certain users or 
   devices access to greater bandwidth during non-busy hours than 
   during busy hours of the day. For example, all desktop video might 
   operate at 1080p during non-peak times, but a similar session might 
   be curtailed between the same users or devices to 720p or 360p 
   during peak hours.  Another example would be to reduce the frames 
   per second (fps) rate, say from 30fps to 15fps. This case is not as 
   clear as accepting or denying similar sessions during different 
   times of the day, but tuning the access to the bandwidth based on 
   the type of session. In other words, tune down the bandwidth for 
   desktop video during peak hours to allow a 3-screen Telepresence 
   session that would otherwise look like the same type of traffic 
   (RTP, and more granular, video).

   RFC 4594 established a guideline for classifying the various flows 
   in the network and the Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP) 
   values that apply to many traffic types (table 3 of [RFC4594]), 
   including RTP based voice and video traffic sessions. The RFC also 
   defined the per hop network behavior that is strongly encouraged for
   each of these application traffic types based on the traffic 
   characteristics and tolerances to delay, loss and jitter within each
   traffic class. 

   Video was broken down into four categories in that RFC, and voice in 


Polk, et al.              Expires Aug 18, 2013                 [Page 3]
Internet-Draft         SDP trafficclass Attribute              Feb 2012

   another single category.  We do not believe this satisfies the 
   technical and business requirements to accomplish sufficiently 
   unique labeling of RTP traffic.

   If the application becomes aware of traffic labeling, 

   - this can be coded into layer 3 mechanisms.

   - this can be coded into layer 4 protocols and/or mechanisms.

   - this can be coded into a combination of mechanisms and protocols. 

   The layer 3 mechanism for differentiating traffic is either the port
   number or the Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP) value 
   [RFC2474]. Within the public Internet, if the application is not 
   part of a managed service, the DSCP value likely will be best effort 
   (BE), or reset to BE when ingressing a provider's network. Within 
   the corporate LAN, this is usually completely configurable and a 
   local IT department can take full advantage of this labeling to 
   shape and manage their network as they see fit.  

   Within a network core, DiffServ typically does not apply. That said,
   DiffServ can be used to identify which traffic goes into which MPLS 
   tunnel [RFC4124].

   Labeling realtime traffic types using a layer 4 protocol would 
   likely involve RSVP [RFC2205] or NSIS [RFC4080]. RSVP has an 
   Application Identifier (app-ID) defined in [RFC2872] that provides a 
   means for carrying a traffic class label along the media path.  An 
   advantage of this mechanism is that the label can inform each domain 
   along the media path what type of traffic this traffic flow is, and 
   allow each domain to adjust the appropriate DSCP value (set by each 
   domain for use within that domain). Meaning, if a DSCP value is set 
   by an endpoint or a router in the first domain and gets reset by a 
   service provider, the far-end domain will be able to reset the DSCP 
   value appropriate for the intended traffic class. There is a 
   proposed extension to RSVP which creates individual profiles for 
   what goes into each app-ID field to describe these traffic classes 
   [ID-RSVP-PROF], which will take advantage of what is described in 
   this document.

   There are several proprietary mechanisms that can take advantage of 
   this labeling, but none of those will be discussed here.

   The idea of traffic - or service - identification is not new; it has
   been described in [RFC5897]. If that RFC is used as a guideline, 
   identification that leads to stream differentiation can be quite 
   useful.  One of the points within RFC 5897 is that users cannot be 
   allowed to assign any identification (fraud is one reason given). In
   addition, RFC 5897 recommends that service identification should be 
   done in signaling, rather than guessing or deep packet inspection. 
   Currently, any network would have to guess or perform deep

   packet inspection to classify traffic and offer the service as per 
   RFC 4594 as such service identification information is currently 
   not available in SDP and therefore to the network elements. Since 
   SDP understands how each stream is created (i.e., the particulars of
   the RTP stream), this is the right place to have this service 
   differentiated. Such service differentiation can then be 
   communicated to and leveraged by the network. 

   [Editor's Note: the words "traffic" and "service" are similar enough
                   that the above paragraph talks about RFC 5897's 
                   "service identification", but this document only 
                   discuss and propose traffic indications in SDP.]

   This document proposes a simple attribute line to identify the 
   application a session is requesting in its offer/answer exchange.  
   This document uses previously defined service class strings for 
   consistency between IETF documents.

   This document modifies the traffic classes originally created in RFC
   4594 in Section 2, incrementing each class with application 
   identifiers and optional adjective strings.  Section 3 defines the 
   new SDP attribute "trafficclass". Section 4 discusses the offerer 
   and answerer behavior when generating or receiving this attribute.


2.  Traffic Class Framework and Component Definitions

   The framework of the traffic class attribute will have at least two 
   parts, called components, allowing for several more to be included 
   further distinguishing a particular session's traffic classification
   from another session's traffic classification. The amount of 
   indicated differentiation between sessions is not a goal, and should
   only have additional components for differentiation if there is a 
   need to uniquely identify traffic in different sessions.

   The intention is to have a category component (e.g., conversational)
   that identifies the traffic pattern for a session. Is the traffic 
   within a session one-way or two-way? Can the traffic be buffered 
   before reaching the destination or not? What is this session's 
   tolerance to packet loss and can there be retransmissions?

   The application component (e.g., video) identifies the basic type of
   traffic within a category. Is it media or data packets? If media, 
   which type of media? If data packets, which application of data 
   packets are in this session?

   The optional adjective component(s) (e.g., immersive) help to 
   further refine the traffic within a session by providing more 
   description. For instance, if a session is two-way voice, what 
   additional information can be given about this particular session to
   refine its description? Is it part of a conference or telepresence 
   session? Is it just standalone voice call? Has a capacity admission

   protocol or mechanism been applied to this session?

   The traffic class label will have the following structure,

      category.application(.adjective)(.adjective)...

   [Editor's Note: the above is not the exact ABNF to be used.  
                   The order is right. The category and application 
                   MUST appear first (each only once) and zero or more 
                   adjectives can appear following the application 
                   component.]

   Where 
   1) the 1st component is the category, and is mandatory;
   2) the 2nd component is the application, and is mandatory;
   3) an optional 3rd component or series of components are 
      adjective(s) used to further refine the application component; 

   The construction of the traffic class label for Telepresence video 
   would follow the minimum form of:

      conversational.video.immersive 

   where there might be one or more adjective after '.immersive'.

   There is no traffic class or DSCP value associated with just 
   "conversational".  There is a traffic class associated with 
   "conversational.video", creating a differentiation between it and a 
   "conversational.video.immersive" traffic class, which would have 
   DSCP associated with the latter traffic class, depending on local 
   policy. Each category component is defined below, as are several of 
   application and adjective strings.  


3. Traffic Class Attribute Definition

   This document proposes the 'trafficclass' session and media-level 
   SDP attribute.  The following is the Augmented Backus-Naur Form 
   (ABNF) [RFC5234] syntax for this attribute, which is based on the 
   SDP [RFC4566] grammar:

      attribute               =/ traffic-class-label
 
      traffic-class-label     = "trafficclass" ":" [SP] category
                                "." application *( "." adjective )
 
      category                = "broadcast" / 
                                "realtime-interactive" / 
                                "multimedia-conferencing" / 
                                "multimedia-streaming" / 
                                "conversational" / tcl-token

Internet-Draft         SDP trafficclass Attribute              Feb 2012

      application             = tcl-token
 
      adjective               = classified-adjective /
                                unclassified-adjective
 
      classified-adjective    = tcl-token ":" tcl-token
 
      unclassified-adjective  = tcl-token
 
      tcl-token               = ALPHA *( [ "-" ] ALPHA / DIGIT )

   The attribute is named "trafficclass", for traffic classification, 
   identifying which one of the five categories applies to the 
   media stream associated with this m-line. There MUST NOT be more 
   than one category component per media line. 

   The categories in this document are an augmented version of the 
   application labels introduced by table 3 of RFC 4595 (which will be 
   rewritten based on the updated labels and treatments expected for 
   each traffic class defined in this document).

       Figure 1. Label Differences from RFC 4594 

   As is evident from the changes above, from left to right, two labels
   are different and each of the meanings are different in this 
   document relative to how RFC 4594 defined them. These differences 
   are articulated in Section 4 of this document.

   Applications and adjectives are defined using the syntax of 
   "tcl-token" defined above. 

   RFC 4566 defined SDP as case sensitive. Everything is here as well.

   An algorithm such as alphabetizing the list of components and 
   matching the understood strings SHOULD be used for determining the 
   traffic within a session.

Internet-Draft         SDP trafficclass Attribute              Feb 2012

   Any category, application, or adjective string component within this
   attribute that is not understood MUST be ignored, leaving all that 
   is understood to be processed. Ignored components SHOULD NOT be 
   deleted, as a downstream entity could understand the component(s) 
   and use it/them during processing.

   The following is an example of media level description with a 
   'trafficclass' attribute:

      m=video 50000 RTP/AVP 112
      a=trafficclass conversational.video.immersive.aq:admitted

   The above indicates the video part of a Telepresence session that 
   has had capacity admission process applied to its media flow.


3.1 Categories within the SDP Traffic Class Label

   The category component within the traffic class attribute describes 
   the type of communication that will occur within that session. It 
   answers these questions, is the traffic

   - one-way or two-or-more-way interactive?

   - elastic or inelastic (as far as retransmissions)?

   - buffered or (virtually) non-buffered?

   - media or non-media (data)?

   The five category components of the traffic class attribute defined 
   within this specification are as follows:

   o conversational
   o multimedia-conferencing
   o realtime-interactive
   o multimedia-streaming
   o broadcast

   Sections 3.1 through 3.5 define each of the above.

   The category component MUST NOT be the only component present in a 
   traffic class attribute. The category component MUST BE paired with 
   an application component to give enough meaning to the traffic class
   labeling goal.

   Not understanding the category component SHOULD mean that this 
   attribute is ignored, because of the information about the 
   communication flow within that component.

3.2 Applications within the SDP Traffic Class Label

   The application component identifies the application of a particular
   traffic flow, for example, audio or video. The application types are
   listed and defined in Section 2 of this document. Not every category
   is paired with every application listed, at least as defined in this 
   document. One or more applications are inappropriate in one or more 
   categories. For example, iptv is a single directional traffic 
   application that is suited for the broadcast (one-way) category 
   rather than categories like realtime-interactive or conversational.

   Section 4.1 through 4.5 list many of the expected combinations.


3.3 Adjectives within the SDP Traffic Class Label

   For additional application type granularity, adjective components 
   can be added. One or more adjectives can be within the same traffic 
   class attribute to provide more differentiation. 

   It is important to note that while the order of component types 
   matter, the order of the adjective components do not. There might be
   local significance to the ordering of adjectives though, such as 
   having a pattern matching algorithm in which labels are matched 
   exactly (i.e., the order matters), or not at all. In other words, 
   the category class component MUST be before the application 
   component, which MUST be before any and all adjective component(s).

   There is no limit to the number of adjectives allowed.

   Adjective components come in two versions, unqualified and 
   qualified. One has a prefix (qualified), the other (unqualified) 
   does not. A defined qualified adjective MUST NOT appear without its 
   qualifier name, even in future extensions to this specification. 
   Some implementations will likely perform a search within this 
   attribute for the presence of qualifiers, which might be as simple 
   as searching for the ":" COLON character. Implementations will be 
   confused with inconsistent coding, therefore strict adherence is 
   necessary.


3.3.1 Qualified Adjectives

   Adjectives can be either unqualified or qualified. Qualified 
   adjectives have a delimiter ":" character between the "qualifier 
   name" and the "qualifier value".  As one example, we introduce in 
   this specification the "admission qualifier" and it has a qualifier 
   name of "aq".  We also define several possible qualifier values for 
   the admission qualifier, namely "admitted", "non-admitted", 
   "partial", and "none".  When present in a TCL string, the qualified 
   adjectives look like these admission qualifier adjectives:
      


Polk, et al.              Expires Aug 18, 2013                 [Page 9]
Internet-Draft         SDP trafficclass Attribute              Feb 2012

      aq:admitted
      aq:non-admitted
      aq:partial
      aq:none

   Defining some adjectives as qualified adjectives allows entities 
   processing the traffic class label to potentially recognize a 
   particular qualifier name and act on it, even if it does not 
   understand the qualifier value.  In the future, a new admission 
   qualifier value might be defined, e.g. "foo", and entities could at 
   least recognize the admission qualifier adjective, even if it did 
   not understand the qualifier value "foo".

   Like all adjectives, it is OPTIONAL to include the admission 
   qualifier adjective in any trafficclass attribute.

  The admission qualifier and its qualifier values are defined as:

   - aq -       'admission qualifier' - this is the qualifier name for 
                the admission qualifier adjectives, wherein the 
                following qualifier values indicate the admission 
                status for the traffic flow described by this m-line.

   - admitted - capacity admission mechanisms or protocols are to be or
                were used for the full amount of bandwidth in relation 
                to this m= line.

   - non-admitted - capacity admission mechanisms or protocols were 
                attempted but failed in relation to this m= line. This 
                does not mean the flow described by this m= line 
                failed. It just failed to attain the capacity admission
                mechanism or protocol necessary for a predictable 
                quality of service, and is likely to continue with only
                a class of service marking or best effort.

   - partial -  capacity admission mechanisms or protocols are to be or
                were used for the part of the amount of bandwidth in 
                relation to this m= line. All traffic above a certain 
                amount will have no capacity admission mechanisms 
                applied. In other words, there is more traffic sent 
                than was agreed to. The burden is on the sender and 
                receiver to deal with any sent and lost information.

   - none -     no capacity admission mechanisms or protocols are or 
                were attempted in relation to this m= line.

   The default for any flow generated from an m-line not having a 
   trafficclass adjective of 'aq:admitted' or 'aq:non-admitted' MUST be
   the equivalent of 'aq:none', whether or not it is present.

4.  Matching Categories with Applications and Adjectives

   This section describes each component within this document, as well 
   as provides the combinations of categories and applications and 
   adjectives. Given that not every combination makes sense, we express
   the limits here - which will be IANA registered.


4.1 Conversational Category Traffic Class

   The "conversational" traffic class is best suited for applications 
   that require very low delay variation and generally intended to 
   enable realtime, bi-directional person-to-person or 
   multi-directional via an MCU communication. Conversational flows are
   inelastic, and with few exceptions, use a UDP transport.

   The following application components are appropriate for use with 
   the Conversational category:

   o audio (voice)

   o video

   o text (i.e., real-time text required by deaf users)

   o multiplex (i.e., combined a/v streams)


   With adjective substrings to the above 

   immersive (TP) - An interactive audio-visual communications 
        experience between remote locations, where the users enjoy a 
        strong sense of realism and presence between all participants 
        by optimizing a variety of attributes such as audio and video 
        quality, eye contact, body language, spatial audio, 
        coordinated environments and natural image size.

   avconf - An interactive audio-visual communication experience 
        that is not immersive in nature, though can have a high 
        resolution video component.

   text - a term for real-time transmission of text in 
        a character-by-character fashion for use in conversational 
        services, often as a text equivalent to voice-based 
        conversational services. Conversational text is defined in the 
        ITU-T Framework for multimedia services, Recommendation F.700 
        [RFC5194].

   Multiplex - an application wherein media of different forms (e.g., 
        audio and video) is multiplexed within the same media flow.

4.2 Multimedia-Conferencing Category Traffic Class 

   The "multimedia-conferencing" traffic class is best suited for 
   applications that are generally intended for communication between 
   human users, but are less demanding in terms of delay, packet loss,

   and jitter than what conversational applications require.  These 
   applications require low to medium delay and may have the ability to
   change encoding rate (rate adaptive) or transmit data at varying 
   rates. 

 +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |Traffic Class  |                               |    Tolerance to    |
 |    Name       |  Traffic Characteristics      | Loss |Delay |Jitter|
 |===============+===============================+======+======+======|

 | conferencing  | Variable transmit interval,   |  -   |  -   |  -   |
 |               | rate adaptive, reacts to      |Medium|Medium|Medium|
 |               | loss, usually TCP-based       |      |      |      |
 +---------------+-------------------------------+------+------+------+

       Figure 4. Multimedia Conferencing Traffic Characteristics

   Multimedia-conferencing flows are not to be media based. Media 
   sessions use other categories. Multimedia-conferencing flows are 
   those data flows that are typically transmitted in parallel to 
   currently active media flows. For example, a two-way conference 
   session in which the users share a presentation. The presentation 
   part of that conference call uses the Multimedia-conferencing 
   category, whereas the audio and any video uses the conversational 
   category indication.

   The following application components are appropriate for use 
   with the Multimedia-Conferencing category:

   o application-sharing (that webex does or protocols like T.128) - 
        An application that shares the output of one or more running 
        applications or the desktop on a host. This can utilize 
        vector graphics, raster graphics or video.

   o presentation-data - can be a series of still images or motion 
        video.

   o whiteboarding - an application enabling the exchange of graphical 
        information including images, pointers and filled and 
        unfilled parametric drawing elements (points, lines, 
        polygons and ellipses).

   o (RTP-based) file-transfer

   o instant messaging

4.3 Realtime-Interactive Category Traffic Class 

   The "Realtime-Interactive" traffic class is intended for interactive 
   variable rate inelastic applications that require low jitter and 
   loss and very low delay. Many of the applications that use the 
   Realtime-Interactive category use TCP or SCTP, even gaming, because 
   lost packets is information that is still required - therefore it is
   retransmitted.

   o remote-desktop - controlling a remote node with local peripherals 
        (i.e., monitor, keyboard and mouse)

   o telemetry - a communication that allows remote measurement and 
        reporting of information (e.g., post launch missile status or 
        energy monitoring)

   With adjective substrings to the above 

   o virtual - To be used with the remote-desktop application component
        specifically when the traffic is a virtual desktop similar to 
        an X-windows station, has no local hard drive, or is operating 
        an computer application with no local storage.

   o webcast

   o multiplex (see Section 4.1)

   The primary difference from the multimedia-streaming category and 
   the broadcast category is about the length of time for buffering. 
   Buffered streaming audio and/or video which are initiated by SDP, 
   and not HTTP. Buffering here can be from many seconds to hours, and 
   is typically at the destination end (as opposed to Broadcast 
   buffering which is minimal at the destination). The buffering aspect
   is what differentiates this category class from the broadcast 
   category  (which has minimal or no buffering).

4.5 Broadcast Category Traffic Class

   The "broadcast" traffic class is best suited for inelastic streaming
   media Applications, which might have a 'wardrobe malfunction' delay 
   at or near the source but not typically at the destination, that may
   be of constant or variable rate, requiring low jitter and very low 
   packet loss. 

   See Section 4.4 for the difference between Multimedia-Streaming and 
   Broadcast; it all has to do with buffering.

 |               | non-bursty flows, generally   |      |      |      |
 |               | sustained high packet rate,   |      |      |      |
 |               | low inter-packet transmission |      |      |      |

       Figure 10. Broadcast Traffic Characteristics


   The following application components are appropriate for use with 
   the Broadcast category:

   o audio (see Section 4.1)

   o video (see Section 4.1)

   o iptv 

   o multiplex (see Section 4.1)

   With adjective substrings to the above:

   o live (non-buffered)

   o surveillance -  one way audio from a microphone or video from a 
            camera (e.g., observing a parking lot or building exit), 
            typically enabled for long periods of time, usually stored 
            at the destination.

5.  Offer/Answer Behavior

   Through the inclusion of the 'trafficclass' attribute, an 
   offer/answer exchange identifies the application type for use by 
   endpoints within a session.  Policy elements can use this attribute 
   to determine the acceptability and/or treatment of that session 
   through lower layers. One specific use-case is for setting of the 
   DSCP specific for that application type (say a broadcast instead
   of a conversational video), decided on a per domain basis - 
   instead of exclusively by the offering domain.  


5.1 Offer Behavior

   Offerers include the 'trafficclass' attribute with a single string 
   comprised of two or more components (from the list in Section 2) to 
   obtain configurable and predictable classification between the 
   answerer and the offerer. The offerer can also include a private set
   of components, or a combination of IANA registered and private 
   components within a single domain (e.g., enterprise networks).

Internet-Draft         SDP trafficclass Attribute              Feb 2012


   Offerers of this 'trafficclass' attribute MUST NOT change the label 
   in transit (e.g., wrt to B2BUAs). Session Border Controllers (SBC) 
   at domain boundaries can change this attribute through local policy.

   Offers containing a 'trafficclass' label not understood are ignored 
   by default (i.e., as if there was no 'trafficclass' attribute in the
   offer).


5.2 Answer Behavior

   Upon receiving an offer containing a 'trafficclass' attribute, if 
   the offer is accepted, the answerer will use this attribute to 
   classify the session or media (level) traffic accordingly towards 
   the offerer. This answer does not need to match the traffic class in
   the offer, though this will likely be the case most of the time.

   In order to understand the traffic class attribute, the answerer 
   MUST check several components within the attribute, such as

   1 - does the answerer understand the category component?

       If not, the attribute SHOULD be ignored. 

       If yes, it checks the application component.

   2 - does the answerer understand the application component?

       If not, the answerer needs to check if it has a local policy to 
       proceed without an application component. The default for this 
       situation is as if the category component was not understand, 
       the attribute SHOULD be ignored.

       If yes, it checks to see if there are any adjective components 
       present in this attribute to start its classification.

   3 - does the answerer understand the adjective component or 
       components if any are present?

       If not present, process and match the trafficclass label value 
       as is.

       If yes, determine if there is more than one. Search for each 
       that is understood. Any adjectives not understood are to be 
       ignored, as if they are not present. Match all remaining 
       understood components according to local policy and process 
       attribute.

   The answerer will answer the offer with its own 'trafficclass' 
   attribute, which will likely be the same value, although this is not
   mandatory (at this time). The Offerer will process the received

Internet-Draft         SDP trafficclass Attribute              Feb 2012

   answer just as the answerer processed the offer. In other words, the
   processing steps and rules are identical for each end.

   The answerer should expect to receive RTP packets marked as 
   indicated by its 'trafficclass' attribute in the answer itself.

   An Answer MAY have a 'trafficclass' attribute when one was not in 
   the offer.  This will at least aid the local domain, and perhaps 
   each domain the session transits, to categorize the application type
   of this RTP session.

   Answerers that are middleboxes can use the 'trafficclass' attribute 
   to classify the RTP traffic within this session however local policy
   determines.  In other words, this attribute can help in deciding 
   which DSCP an RTP stream is assigned within a domain, if the 
   answerer were an inbound SBC to a domain.


6.  Security considerations

   RFC 5897 [RFC5897] discusses many of the pitfalls of service 
   classification, which is similar enough to this idea of traffic 
   classification to apply here as well.  That document highly 
   recommends the user not being able to set any classification.  
   Barring a hack within an endpoint (i.e., to intentionally 
   misclassifying (i.e., lying) about which classification an RTP 
   stream is), this document's solution makes the classification part 
   of the signaling between endpoints, which is recommended by RFC 
   5897.

Appendix - Changes from Previous Versions

A.1  From -02 to -03

   These are the following changes made between the WG -02 version and 
   the -03 version:

   - Rearranged a fair amount of text

   - Separated and defined the components into separate subsections.

   - built 5 different tables, one per category, that lists within each
     category - what applications are appropriate as well as what 
     adjectives are appropriate for each application within that 
     category.

   - added the 'partial' admission qualifier for those flows that have 
     only part of their respective flow admitted (i.e., CAC'd).

A.2  From -01 to -02

   These are the following changes made between the WG -01 version and 
   the -02 version:
   - converged the use of terms 'parent' and 'category' to just 
     'category' for consistency.

   - changed ABNF to reflect extensibility by not having applications 
     and adjectives named in the ABNF, rather have them merely IANA 
     registered.

   - merged the qualified and unqualified adjective sections into a 
     single section on adjectives, but allowing some to have a 
     preceding qualifier.

   - text clean-up


A.3  From -00 to -01

   These are the following changes made between the WG -00 version and 
   the -01 version:

   - removed the non-SDP applications Netflix and VOD

   - switched the adjective 'desktop' to 'avconf'

   - Labeled each of the figures.

   - clarified the differences between Multimedia-Streaming and 
     Broadcast category categories.

   - defined Video surveillance

   - added the concept of a 'qualified' adjective, and modified the 
     ABNF.

   - deleted the idea of a 'cac-class' as a separate component, and 
     made the equivalent a qualified adjective.

   - modified the answerer behavior because of the removal of the 

     'cac-class' component.

   - created an IANA registry for qualified adjectives

   - general clean-up of the doc.

   Did *not* do the following in this version:

   - add the ability to have more than one trafficclass attribute based
     on the codec chosen, as feedback indicated this was a bad idea.

   - no swap of the Multimedia-Conferencing category with the 
     offered Collaboration category, as doing this did not solve 
     any perceived problems.

   - add more to the 'how does this get processed' portion of Section 
     3. That will come in the next revision.
