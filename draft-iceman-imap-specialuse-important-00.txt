               draft-iceman-imap-specialuse-important-00

   RFC 6154 created an IMAP Special-Use LIST extension and defined an
   initial set of attributes.  This document defines a new attribute,
   "\Important", and establishes a new IANA registry for IMAP Special-
   Use LIST extension folder attributes, updating RFC 6154.

Internet-Draft         IMAP Special-Use: Important          January 2013


1.  Introduction

   [RFC6154] defines an extension to the Internet Message Access
   Protocol (IMAP) LIST command [RFC3501] for special-use mailboxes.
   The extension allows servers to provide extra information
   (attributes) about the purpose of a mailbox and defines an initial
   set of special-use attributes.  RFC 6154 did not define a registry
   for those attributes.

   This document defines a new special-use attribute, "\Important", to
   designate a mailbox that will hold messages that are considered
   important for the user, by some externally defined criteria.  This
   document also creates a registry for IMAP special-use mailbox
   attributes and registers both the new attribute and the initial set,
   updating RFC 6154.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.


2.  Definition of the 'Important' Attribute

   The "\Important" mailbox attribute is a signal that the mailbox
   contains messages that are likely important to the user.  For
   example, the system might automatically put messages there based on
   available signals (such as who the message is from, who else the
   message is addressed to, evaluation of the subject or content).  Or
   it might be a way for users to train the system as to what messages
   are important (the system can learn patterns from the messages the
   user copies to that mailbox).

   This is distinct from the "\Flagged" attribute in that evaluation of
   importance here is based on heuristics, whereas "\Flagged" is
   typically based on the setting of the IMAP flag of the same name.

2.1.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification updates the one in [RFC6154],
   Section 6, using Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as described in
   [RFC5234].

       use-attr      =/  "\Important"

2.2.  Example

   In the following example, the mailbox called "Important Messages" is
   the one designated with the "\Important" attribute.

       C: t1 list "" "Imp*"
       S: * LIST (\HasNoChildren \Important) "/" "Important Messages"
       S: * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "/" "Imported Wine"
       S: t1 OK Success


3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC6154], Section 7, apply equally to
   this extension.  In particular, "Conveying special-use information to
   a client exposes a small bit of extra information that could be of
   value to an attacker."  Moreover, identifying a place where
   "important" messages are kept could give an attacker a strategic
   starting point.  If the algorithm by which messages are determined to
   be important is well known, still more information is exposed --
   perhaps, for example, there is an implication that the senders of
   these messages are particularly significant to the mailbox owner, and
   perhaps that is information that should not be made public.

   As noted in RFC 6154, it is wise to protect the IMAP channel from
   passive eavesdropping, and to defend against unauthorized discernment
   of the identity of a user's "\Important" mailbox.


4.  IANA Considerations

   [[RFC Editor: Please replace "THIS RFC" throughout this section with
   the identification given to this document, and remove this
   paragraph.]]

4.1.  Creation of the IMAP LIST Special-Use Attributes Registry

   IANA is asked to create a new registry in the group "Internet Message
   Access Protocol (IMAP) 4 Registries".  The new registry will be
   called "IMAP LIST Special-Use Attributes", and will have as its
   reference RFC 6154 and THIS RFC.  New registrations will be accepted
   through the Expert Review policy [RFC5226] (and see Section 4.3).

   The registry entries will contain three fields:
   1.  Attribute Name
   2.  Description

   3.  Reference
   IANA will keep this list in alphabetical order by Attribute Name,
   which is registered without the initial backslash ("\").

4.2.  Initial entries for the registry

   The registry will initially consist of:

       +-----------+-----------------------------------+-----------+
       | Attribute | Description                       | Reference |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------+-----------+
       | All       | All messages                      | [RFC6154] |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------+-----------+
       | Archive   | Archived messages                 | [RFC6154] |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------+-----------+
       | Drafts    | Messages that are working drafts  | [RFC6154] |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------+-----------+
       | Flagged   | Messages with the \Flagged flag   | [RFC6154] |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------+-----------+
       | Important | Messages deemed important to user | THIS RFC  |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------+-----------+
       | Junk      | Messages identified as Spam/Junk  | [RFC6154] |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------+-----------+
       | Sent      | Sent mail                         | [RFC6154] |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------+-----------+
       | Trash     | Messages the user has discarded   | [RFC6154] |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------+-----------+

4.3.  Instructions to the Designated Expert

   The expert reviewer, who will be designated by the IESG, is expected
   to provide only a general review of the requested registration,
   checking that the reference and description are adequate for
   understanding the intent of the registered attribute.  Efforts should
   also be made to generalize the intent of an attribute so that
   multiple implementations with the same requirements may reuse
   existing attributes.  Except for this check, this is intended to be
   very close to a first come first served policy, and the expert should
   not block serious registration requests with a reasonable reference.
   The reference may be to any form of documentation, including a web
   page, but consideration should be given to providing one that is
   expected to be long-lived and stable.
