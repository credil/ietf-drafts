           IPFIX Information Elements for logging NAT Events
                 draft-ietf-behave-ipfix-nat-logging-00

Abstract

   NAT devices are required to log events like creation and deletion of
   translations and information about the resources it is managing.
   With the wide deployment of Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) devices, the
   logging of events have become very important for legal purposes.  The
   logs are required in many cases to identify an attacker or a host
   that was used to launch malicious attacks and/or for various other
   purposes of accounting.  Since there is no standard way of logging
   this information, different NAT devices behave differently and hence
   it is difficult to expect a consistent behavior.  The lack of a
   consistent way makes it difficult to write the collector applications
   that would receive this data and process it to present useful
   information.  This document describes the information that is
   required to be logged by the NAT devices.

Internet-Draft         IPFIX IEs for NAT logging              March 2013


   The usage of the term "NAT device" in this document refer to any
   NAT44 and NAT64 devices.  The usage of the term "collector" refers to
   any device that receives the binary data from a NAT device and
   converts that into meaningful information.  This document uses the
   term "Session" as it is defined in [RFC2663] and the term BIB as it
   is defined in [RFC6146]

2.  Introduction

   This document details the IPFIX Information Elements(IEs) that are
   required for logging by a NAT device.  The document will specify the
   format of the IE's that are required to be logged by the NAT device
   and all the optional fields.  The fields specified in this document
   are gleaned from [RFC4787] and [RFC5382].

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Scope

   This document provides the information model to be used for logging
   the NAT devices including Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) events.  This
   document focuses exclusively on the specification of IPFIX IE's.
   This document does not provide guidance on the transport protocol
   like TCP, UDP or SCTP that is to be used to log NAT events.  The log
   events SHOULD NOT be lost but the choice of the actual transport
   protocol is beyond the scope of this document.

   The existing IANA IPFIX Information Elements registry [IPFIX-IANA]
   already has assignments for many NAT logging events.  For
   convenience, this document uses those same Information Elements.
   However, as stated earlier, this document is not defining IPFIX or
   Netflow 9 as the framework for logging.  Rather, the information
   contained in these elements is within the scope of this document.

   This document assumes that the NAT device will use the existing IPFIX
   framework to send the log events to the collector.  This would mean
   that the NAT device will specify the template that it is going to use
   for each of the events.  The templates can be of varying length and
   there could be multiple templates that a NAT device could use to log
   the events.

   The implementation details of the collector application is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   The optimization of logging the NAT events are left to the
   implementation and are beyond the scope of this document.

4.  Applicability

   NAT logging based on IPFIX uses binary encoding and hence is very
   efficient.  IPFIX based logging is recommended for environments where
   a high volume of logging is required, for example, where per-flow
   logging is needed.  However, IPFIX based logging requires a collector
   that processes the binary data and requires a network management
   application that converts this binary data to a human readable
   format.

5.  Event based logging

   An event in a NAT device can be viewed as a happening as it relates
   to the management of NAT resources.  The creation and deletion of NAT
   sessions and bindings are examples of events as it results in the
   resources (addresses and ports) being allocated or freed.  The events
   can happen either through the processing of data packets flowing
   through the NAT device or through an external entity installing
   policies on the NAT router or as a result of an asynchronous event
   like a timer.  The list of events are provided in Section 4.1.  Each
   of these events SHOULD be logged, unless they are administratively
   prohibited.  A NAT device MAY log these events to multiple collectors
   if redundancy is required.  The network administrator will specify
   the collectors to which the log records are to be sent.

   A collector may receive NAT events from multiple CGN devices and
   should be able to distinguish between the devices.  Each CGN device
   should have a unique source ID to identify themselves.  The source ID
   is part of the IPFIX template and data exchange.

   Prior to logging any events, the NAT device MUST send the template of
   the record to the collector to advertise the format of the data
   record that it is using to send the events.  The templates can be
   exchanged as frequently as required given the reliability of the
   connection.  There SHOULD be a configurable timer for controlling the
   template refresh.  NAT device SHOULD combine as many events as
   possible in a single packet to effectively utilize the network
   bandwidth.

5.1.  Information Elements

   The templates could contain a subset of the Information Elements(IEs)
   shown in Table 1 depending upon the event being logged.  For example
   a NAT44 session creation template record will contain,

   {sourceIPv4Adress, postNATSourceIPv4Address, destinationIpv4Address,
   postNATDestinationIPv4Address, sourceTransportPort,
   postNAPTSourceTransportPort, destinationTransportPort,
   postNAPTDestTransportPort, natOriginatingAddressRealm, natEvent,
   timeStamp}

   An example of the actual event data record is shown below - in a
   readable form

   {192.168.16.1, 201.1.1.100, 207.85.231.104, 207.85.231.104, 14800,
   1024, 80, 80, 0, 1, 09:20:10:789}

   A single NAT device could be exporting multiple templates and the
   collector should support receiving multiple templates from the same
   source.

   The events below are identified at the time of this writing but the
   events are expandable.  Depending on the implementation and
   configuration various IE's specified can be included or ignored.

5.4.1.  NAT44 create and delete session event

   This event will be generated when a NAT44 session is created or
   deleted.  The template will be the same, the natEvent will indicate
   whether it is a create or a delete event.  The following is a

5.4.7.  Quota exceeded

   This event will be generated when a NAT device cannot allocate
   resources as a result of an administratively defined policy.  The
   examples of Quota exceeded are to allow only certain number of NAT
   sessions per device, certain number of NAT sessions per user etc.
   The following is a template of the event.

5.4.8.  Address Binding

   This event will be generated when a NAT device binds a local address
   with a global address.  This binding event happens when the first
   packet of the first flow from a host in the private realm.

5.4.9.  Port block allocation and de-allocation

   This event will be generated when a NAT device allocates/de-allocates
   ports in a bulk fashion, as opposed to allocating a port on a per
   flow basis.  NAT devices would do this in order to reduce logs and
   potentially to limit the number of connections a subscriber is
   allowed to use.  In the following Port Block allocation template, the
   portRangeStart must be specified.  Along with portRangeStart, atleast
   one of portRangeEnd, portRangeStepSize or portRangeNumPorts MUST be
   specified.  If portRangeEnd is specified, it MUST NOT be lesser than
   portRangeStart.  The value of portRangeStepSize MUST be between 1 and
   32K.

6.  Encoding

6.1.  IPFIX

   This document uses IPFIX as the encoding mechanism to describe the
   logging of NAT events.  However, the information that should be
   logged SHOULD be the same irrespective of what kind of encoding
   scheme is used.  IPFIX is chosen because is it an IETF standard that
   meets all the needs for a reliable logging mechanism.  IPFIX provides
   the flexibility to the logging device to define the data sets that it
   is logging.  The information elements specified for logging MUST be
   the same irrespective of the encoding mechanism used.
