            Indicating Email Handling States in Trace Fields
                  draft-ietf-appsawg-received-state-02

Abstract

   This memo registers a trace field clause for use in indicating
   transitions between handling queues or processing states, including
   enacting inter- and intra-host message transitions.  This might
   include message quarantining, mailing list moderation, timed
   delivery, queueing for further analysis, content conversion, or other
   similar causes, as well as optionally identifying normal handling
   queues.

Internet-Draft            Email Handling States                June 2012


1.  Introduction

   [SMTP] defines the content of email message trace fields, commonly
   the "Received" header field.  These are typically used to record an
   audit trail of the path a message follows from origin to destination,
   with one such field added each time a message moves from one host to
   the next.

   Section 3.7.2 of that memo mentions that "the most important use of
   of Received: lines is for debugging mail faults [...]".

   There are some cases where there may be large time gaps between trace
   fields.  Though this might be caused by transient communication
   issues, they might also be caused by policy decisions or special
   processing regarding the content of the message, authorization of
   some identity on the message, or transitions between major software
   components.  Common examples include message quarantines (filters
   that delay relaying or delivery of a message pending manual operator
   action), pending content analysis, or mailing list servers that
   impose moderation rules (mailing list owner action required regarding
   mail from authors not subscribed to those lists).

   This memo registers a new optional clause that can be used in trace
   fields to indicate that a message entered such a special processing
   queue or state for some period.  This allows inspection of the trace
   information to reveal that the cause for a time gap in trace fields
   was an imposed delay rather than one caused by transient technical
   difficulties.

2.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3.  New Trace Clause

   This memo creates a new trace field clause, called "state", which can
   be used within Received header fields (see Section 4.4 of [SMTP]) to
   indicate the nature of a delay imposed on relaying of a message
   toward its recipient(s).  It is followed by a single keyword that
   provides that detail.  A Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) or other handling
   agent that determines a message has entered a state other than normal
   queueing of messages for relaying or delivery MAY generate a trace
   field including one of these clauses.  That is, the presence of this
   clause on a trace field is an indication of the entry of the message
   into that state; a later trace field added would indicate its
   departure from that state.

   Appropriate use of this mechanism does not include associating meta-
   data with the message, such as categorizing the message (e.g., the
   notions of "is spam" or "was 8-bit, converted to 7-bit").

   Use of this clause by transfer agents is OPTIONAL.

   The following state keywords are defined in this document; extensions
   may define other registered keywords (see Section 6.2):

   auth:  The message entered a queue pending authentication of some
      identifier in the message.

   content:  The message entered a queue pending content analysis, such
      as scanning for spam or viruses.

   convert:  The message entered a queue pending content conversion.

   moderation:  The message entered a hold pending mailing list
      moderator action.

   normal:  The message is not in an administrative hold and is queued
      for or is being handed off to the next handling agent (which may
      be local delivery).  This is the default interpretation when no
      "state" clause is present.

   other:  The message entered a hold or queue for reasons not covered
      by other keywords in this list, and not for transient technology
      issues.

   outbound:  The message entered a queue for outbound relaying.  This
      is typically the last case added for a single host, and the next
      Received header field is expected to be added by some other host.

   quarantine:  The message entered a hold in an isolation queue pending
      operator action for local policy reasons.

   timed:  The message entered a hold in order to meet a requested
      delivery window, such as is defined in [FUTURERELEASE].

   The ABNF for this clause:

      State = CFWS "state" FWS queue-state-keyword *( "/" value )

      queue-state-keyword = ( reg-state-keyword / unreg-state-keyword )

      reg-state-keyword = ( "auth" / "content" / "convert" /
                            "moderation" / "normal" / "other" /
                            "outbound" / "quarantine" / "timed" /
                            additional-state-keyword )

      additional-state-keyword = unstructured
                               ; see "IANA Considerations" below

      value = unstructured

      unreg-state-keyword = unstructured

   "unstructured", "FWS" and "CFWS" are defined in [MAIL]

   A transfer agent making use of this extension MAY also include header
   field comments to provide additional information.

   The "value" is available for providing additional labels as
   explanation for the state transition.  Examples could include:

   o  convert/unicode2ascii

   o  moderation/not-subscribed

   o  quarantine/spam

4.  Discussion

   Handling agents are not expected to implement or support all of
   these.  Indeed, recording trace information for all of the states
   described above could make the header of a message inordinately
   large.  Rather, an agent is encouraged to apply state annotations
   when a message enters a handling queue where substantial delay is
   possible, and especially when a handoff has occurred between two
   different, independent agents.

   For example, an MTA receiving a message, doing message
   authentication, scanning for viruses and spam, and then putting it in
   an outbound queue could add four Received header fields denoting each
   of these states.  However, where they are all done as part of a
   single system process, in a single pass, doing so would be considered
   unusual (and extremely verbose).  This method SHOULD NOT be applied
   except when doing detailed analysis of a single component to identify
   performance issues with those steps.

Internet-Draft            Email Handling States                June 2012


   Rather, an agent that wishes to make a state annotation SHOULD add
   only a single Received header field including such annotation, thus
   indicating (a) the time of completion of its handling of the message
   via the date portion of the field, and (b) the final disposition of
   that message relative to that agent.  For example, an MTA receiving a
   message that performs various checks on the message before
   immediately handing it off to a Mailing List Manager (MLM) would only
   record a "normal" state, assuming it passes those checks.  The MLM
   would then evaluate the message and record its own state once it
   decides what the next step will be for the handling of that message.

5.  Granularity

   The degree of granularity -- and therefore the degree of verbosity --
   recorded through the use of this additional trace clause is likely to
   vary depending on circumstances.  It will typically be the case that
   use of this clause will be limited to "unusual" transitions, such as
   when a message requires additional scrutiny or other processing, or
   needs to be quarantined.

   Somewhat greater granularity might also include transitions of
   administrative responsibility, such as between an Mail Transfer Agent
   (MTA) operator and a Mailing List Manager (MLM) operator.  This could
   be further enhanced to note some transitions that are interesting
   only when other transitions have occurred, such as noting entry to
   the outbound queue only when the message is originating from an
   "interesting" source, like an MLM, since an MLM can introduce
   significant delay and it could be useful to know when it completed
   its processing, as distinct from the subsequent processing by the
   originating MTA.  In circumstances needing very fine-grained trace
   information, fields might be created to note all of these
   "significant" network architecture transitions.

   One should note, however, when choosing higher levels of granularity,
   that the Received header fields present on a message could be counted
   by MTAs when trying to decide whether or not a message routing loop
   is in effect.  A message with an abundance of these might cause an
   incorrect determination that the message is in a delivery loop,
   causing it to be removed from the mail stream.  See Section 6.3 of
   [SMTP] for further discussion.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Mail Parameters Additional-registered-clauses Sub-Registry

   This memo adds to the "Additional-registered-clauses" sub-registry of
   the "Mail Parameters" registry, created by [SMTP], the following
   entry:

Internet-Draft            Email Handling States                June 2012


   Clause name:  state

   Description:  Indicates entry into a special queue state

   Syntax Summary:  state <state-name>

   Reference:  [this memo]

6.2.  Mail Parameters Registered-states Sub-Registry

   The "Mail Parameters" registry at IANA is updated by the creation of
   the "Registered-states" sub-registry to contain valid state keywords
   for use with this specification.  Updates to this registry are
   governed by the First Come First Served rules of [IANA] for new
   registrations.  Changes to the status of existing entries are limited
   to the original registrant or IESG approval.

   Discussion of all registry updates is encouraged via one or more IETF
   mailing lists that typically cover email-related subjects prior to
   approval of the change, as a way of documenting the work.

   Note that only registrations of queue state keywords are permitted.
   The registry is not to be used for specifying secondary information
   (i.e., the "value" part of the ABNF in Section 3).

   Registrations must include the following entries:

   Name:  The name of the state keyword being defined or updated, which
      conforms to the ABNF shown in Section 3

   Description:  A brief description of the keyword's meaning

   Specification:  The specification document that defines the queue
      state being registered

   Use:  One of "current" (the state keyword is in current use),
      "deprecated" (the state keyword is in use but not recommended for
      new implementations), or "historic" (the state keyword is no
      longer in substantial current use).

   The initial registration set is as follows:

7.  Security Considerations

   The use of this trace information can reveal hints as to local policy
   that was in effect at the time of message handling.

   Further discussion about trace field security can be found in Section
   7.6 of [SMTP].

Appendix A.  Trace Field Examples

   This section includes a sample of the new trace field clause in use.

A.1.  Typical Delivery Without Obvious Delays

   Typical message delivery

        Received: from newyork.example.com
                  (newyork.example.com [192.0.2.250])
              by mail-router.example.net (8.11.6/8.11.6)
                  with ESMTP id i7PK0sH7021929
                  for <recipient@example.net>;
              Fri, Feb 15 2002 17:19:22 -0800
        Received: from internal.example.com
                  (internal.example.com [192.168.0.1])
              by newyork.example.com (8.11.6/8.11.6)
                  with ESMTP id i9MKZCRd064134
                  for <recipient@example.net>;
              Fri, Feb 15 2002 17:19:08 -0800

A.2.  Delivery With Moderation

   Message delivery after moderation

        Received: from newyork.example.com
                  (newyork.example.com [192.0.2.250])
              by mail-router.example.net (8.11.6/8.11.6)
                  with ESMTP id i7PK0sH7021929
                  for <recipient@example.net>;
              Fri, Feb 15 2002 18:33:29 -0800
        Received: from internal.example.com
                  (internal.example.com [192.168.0.1])
              by newyork.example.com (8.11.6/8.11.6)
                  with ESMTP id i9MKZCRd064134
                  for <secret-list@example.com>
                  state moderation (sender not subscribed);
              Fri, Feb 15 2002 17:19:08 -0800

   Example 2: Message held for moderation; only Received header fields
   shown

   The message passed from internal.example.com to newyork.example.com
   intended for a mailing list hosted at the latter.  For list
   administrative reasons, the message is held there for moderation.  It
   is finally released over an hour later and passed to the next host.
   A comment after the state expression indicates the actual cause for
   the administrative hold.
