     Security Extension for OSPFv2 when using Manual Key Management
          draft-ietf-ospf-security-extension-manual-keying-06

Abstract

   The current OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as defined
   in RFC 2328 and RFC 5709 is vulnerable to both inter-session and
   intra-session replay attacks when using manual keying.  Additionally,
   the existing cryptographic authentication schemes do not cover the IP
   header.  This omission can be exploited to carry out various types of
   attacks.

   This draft proposes changes to the authentication sequence number
   mechanism that will protect OSPFv2 from both inter-session and intra-
   session replay attacks when using manual keys for securing OSPFv2
   protocol packets.  Additionally, we also describe some changes in the
   cryptographic hash computation so that we eliminate most attacks that
   result from OSPFv2 not protecting the IP header.

1.  Introduction

   The OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as described in
   [RFC2328] uses per-packet sequence numbers to provide protection
   against replay attacks.  The sequence numbers increase monotonically
   so that attempts to replay the stale packets can be thwarted.  The
   sequence number values are maintained as a part of adjacency states.
   Therefore, if an adjacency is taken down, the associated sequence
   numbers get reinitialized and the neighbors start all over again.
   Additionally, the cryptographic authentication mechanism does not
   specify how to deal with the rollover of a sequence number when its
   value wraps.  These omissions can be taken advantage of by attackers
   to implement various replay attacks ([RFC6039]).  In order to address
   these issues, we propose extensions to the authentication sequence
   number mechanism.

   The cryptographic authentication as described in [RFC2328] and later
   updated in [RFC5709] does not include the IP header.  This also can
   be exploited to launch several attacks as the source address in the
   IP header is no longer protected.  The OSPF specification, for
   broadcast and NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access Networks), requires
   implementations to look at the source address in the IP header to
   determine the neighbor from which the packet was received.  Changing
   the IP source address of a packet that confuses the receiver and can
   be exploited to produce a number of denial of service attacks
   [RFC6039].  If the packet is interpreted as coming from a different
   neighbor, the sequence number received from the neighbor may be
   updated.  This may disrupt communication with the legitimate
   neighbor.  Hello packets may be reflected to cause a neighbor to
   appear to have one-way communication.  Additionally, Database
   Description packets may be reflected in cases where the per-packet
   sequence numbers are sufficiently divergent in order to disrupt an
   adjacency [RFC6863].  This is referred to as the IP layer issue in
   [RFC6862].

   [RFC2328] states that implementations MUST offer keyed MD5
   authentication.  It is likely that this will be deprecated in favor
   of the stronger algorithms described in [RFC5709] and required in
   [RFC6094].

   This draft proposes a few simple changes to the cryptographic
   authentication mechanism, as currently described in [RFC5709], to
   prevent such IP layer attacks.

2.  Replay Protection using Extended Sequence Numbers

   In order to provide replay protection against both inter-session and
   intra-session replay attacks, the OSPFv2 sequence number is expanded
   to 64-bits with the least significant 32-bit value containing a
   strictly increasing sequence number and the most significant 32-bit
   value containing the boot count.  OSPFv2 implementations are required
   to retain the boot count in non-volatile storage for the deployment
   life the OSPF router.  The requirement to preserve the boot count is
   also placed on SNMP agents by the SNMPv3 security architecture (refer
   to snmpEngineBoots in [RFC4222]).

   Since there is no room in the OSPFv2 packet for a 64-bit sequence
   number, it will occupy the 8 octets following the OSPFv2 packet and
   MUST be included when calculating the OSPFv2 packet digest.  These
   additional 8 bytes are not included in the OSPFv2 packet header
   length but are included in the OSPFv2 header Authentication Data
   length and the IPv4 packet header length.

   The lower order 32-bit sequence number MUST be incremented for every
   OSPF packet sent by the OSPF router.  Upon reception, the sequence
   number MUST be greater than the sequence number in the last OSPF
   packet of that type accepted from the sending OSPF neighbor.
   Otherwise, the OSPF packet is considered a replayed packet and
   dropped.  OSPF packets of different types may arrive out of order if
   they are prioritized as recommended in [RFC3414].

   OSPF routers implementing this specification MUST use available
   mechanisms to preserve the sequence number's strictly increasing
   property for the deployed life of the OSPFv3 router (including cold
   restarts).  This is achieved by maintaining a boot count in non-
   volatile storage and incrementing it each time the OSPF router loses
   its prior sequence number state.  The SNMPv3 snmpEngineBoots variable
   [RFC4222] MAY be used for this purpose.  However, maintaining a
   separate boot count solely for OSPF sequence numbers has the
   advantage of decoupling SNMP reinitialization and OSPF

   reinitialization.  Also, in the rare event that the lower order 32-
   bit sequence number wraps, the boot count can be incremented to
   preserve the strictly increasing property of the aggregate sequence
   number.  Hence, a separate OSPF boot count is RECOMMENDED.


3.  OSPF Packet Extensions

   The OSPF packet header includes an authentication type field, and 64-
   bits of data for use by the appropriate authentication scheme
   (determined by the type field).  Authentication types 0, 1 and 2 are
   defined [RFC2328].  This section of this defines Authentication type
   TBD (3 is recommended).

   When using this authentication scheme, the 64-bit Authentication
   field in the OSPF packet header as defined in section D.3 of
   [RFC2328] is changed as shown below.  The sequence number is removed
   and the Key ID is extended to 32 bits and moved to the former
   position of the sequence number.

   Additionally, the 64-bit sequence number is moved to the first 64-
   bits following the OSPFv2 packet and is protected by the
   authentication digest.  These additional 64 bits or 8 octets are
   included in the IP header length but not the OSPF header packet
   length.

4.  OSPF Packet Key Selection

   This section describes how the proposed security solution selects
   long-lived keys from key tables.  [I-D.ietf-karp-crypto-key-table].
   Generally, a key used for OSPFv2 packet authentication should satisfy
   the following requirements:

   o  For packet transmission, the key validity interval as defined by
      SendLifetimeStart and SendLifetimeEnd must include the current
      time.

   o  For packet reception, the key validity interval as defined by
      AcceptLifetimeStart and AcceptLifetimeEnd must include the current
      time.

Internet-Draft         OSPF Manual Key Management          November 2013


   o  The key must be valid for the desired security algorithm.

   In the remainder of this section, additional requirements for keys
   are enumerated for different scenarios.

4.1.  Key Selection for Unicast OSPF Packet Transmission

   Assume that a router R1 tries to send a unicast OSPF packet from its
   interface I1 to the interface R2 of a remote router R2 using security
   protocol P via interface I at time T. First, consider the
   circumstances where R1 and R2 are not connected with a virtual link.
   R1 then needs to select a long long-lived symmetric key from its key
   table.  Because the key should be shared by the by both R1 and R2 to
   protect the communication between I1 and I2, the key should satisfy
   the following requirements:

   o  The Peers field is unused.  OSPF authentication is interface
      based.

   o  The Interfaces field includes the local IP address of the
      interface for numbered interfaces or the MIB-II [RFC1213], ifIndex
      for unnumbered interfaces.

   o  The Direction field is either "out" or "both".

   o  If multiple keys match the Interface, the key with the most recent
      SendLifetimeStart time will be selected.  This will facilitate
      graceful key rollover.

   o  The Key ID field in the OSPFv2 header (refer to figure 1) will be
      set to the selected key's LocalKeyName.

   When R1 and R2 are connected to a virtual link, the interfaces field
   must identify the virtual endpoint rather than the virtual link.
   Since there may be virtual links to the same router, the transit area
   ID must be part of the identifier.  Hence, the key should satisfy the
   following requirements:

   o  The Peers field is unused.  OSPF authentication is interface
      based.

   o  The Interfaces field includes both the virtual endpoint's OSPF
      router ID and the transit area ID for the virtual link.

   o  The Direction field is either "out" or "both".

   o  If multiple keys match the Interface, the key with the most recent
      SendLifetimeStart time will be selected.  This will facilitate

Internet-Draft         OSPF Manual Key Management          November 2013


      graceful key rollover.

   o  The Key ID field in the OSPFv2 header (refer to figure 1) will be
      set to the selected key's LocalKeyName.

4.2.  Key Selection for Multicast OSPF Packet Transmission

   If a router R1 sends an OSPF packet from its interface I1 to a
   multicast address (e.g., AllSPFRouters, AllDRouters), it needs to
   select a key according to the following requirements:

   o  The Peers field is unused.  OSPF authentication is interface
      based.

   o  The Interfaces field includes the local IP address of the
      interface for numbered interfaces or the MIB-II [RFC1213], ifIndex
      for unnumbered interfaces.

   o  The Direction field is either "out" or "both".

   o  If multiple keys match the Interface, the key with the most recent
      SendLifetimeStart time will be selected.  This will facilitate
      graceful key rollover.

   o  The Key ID field in the OSPFv2 header (refer to figure 1) will be
      set to the selected key's LocalKeyName.

4.3.  Key Selection for OSPF Packet Reception

   When Cryptographic Authentication is used, the ID of the
   authentication key is included in the authentication field of the
   OSPF packet header.  Using this key ID, it is relatively easy for a
   receiver to locate the key.  The simple requirements are:

   o  The interface on which the key was received is associated with the
      key's interface.

   o  The Key ID obtained from the OSPFv2 packet header corresponds to
      the neighbor's PeerKeyName.  Since OSPFv2 keys are symmetric, the
      LocalKeyName and PeerKeyName for OSPFv2 keys will be identical.
      Hence, the Key ID will be used to select the correct local key.

   o  The Direction field is either "in" or "both".

5.  Securing the IP header

   This document updates the definition of Apad which is currently a
   constant defined in [RFC5709] to the source address from the IP
   header of the OSPFv2 protocol packet.  The overall cryptographic
   authentication process defined in [RFC5709] remains unchanged.  To
   reduce the potential for confusion, this section minimizes the
   repetition of text from RFC 5709 and is incorporated here by
   reference [RFC5709].

   RFC 5709, Section 3.3, describes how the cryptographic authentication
   must be computed.  It requires OSPFv2 packet's Authentication Trailer
   (which is the appendage described in RFC 2328, Section D.4.3, Page
   233, items (6)(a) and (6)(d)) to be filled with the value Apad where
   Apad is a hexadecimal constant value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L/4) times,
   where L is the length of the hash being used and is measured in
   octets rather than bits.

   Routers at the sending side must initialize Apad to a value of the
   source address that would be used when sending out the OSPFv2 packet,
   repeated L/4 times, where L is the length of the hash, measured in
   octets.  The basic idea is to incorporate the source address from the
   IP header in the cryptographic authentication computation so that any
   change of IP source address in a replayed packet can be detected.

   At the receiving end, implementations MUST initialize Apad as the
   source address from IP Header of the incoming OSPFv2 packet, repeated
   L/4 times, instead of the constant that's currently defined in
   [RFC5709].  Besides changing the value of Apad, this document does
   not introduce any other changes to the authentication mechanism
   described in [RFC5709].  This would prevent all attacks where a rogue
   OSPF router changes the IP source address of an OSPFv2 packet and
   replays it on the same multi-access interface or another interface
   since the IP source address is now protected and modification would
   result in the OSPFv2 packet being dropped due to an authentication
   failure.


6.  Mitigating Cross-Protocol Attacks

   In order to prevent cross protocol replay attacks for protocols
   sharing common keys, the two octet OSPFv2 Cryptographic Protocol ID
   is appended to the authentication key prior to use.  Refer to IANA
   Considerations (Section 8).

   [RFC5709], Section 3.3 describes the mechanism to prepare the key
   used in the hash computation.  This document updates the sub section
   "PREPARATION OF KEY" as follows:



Bhatia, et al.            Expires May 29, 2014                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         OSPF Manual Key Management          November 2013


   The OSPFv2 Cryptographic Protocol ID is appended to the
   Authentication Key (K) yielding a Protocol-Specific Authentication
   Key (Ks).  In this application, Ko is always L octets long.  While
   [RFC2104] supports a key that is up to B octets long, this
   application uses L as the Ks length consistent with [RFC4822],
   [RFC5310], and [RFC5709].  According to [FIPS-198], Section 3, keys
   greater than L octets do not significantly increase the function
   strength.  Ks is computed as follows:

   If the Protocol-Specific Authentication Key (Ks) is L octets long,
   then Ko is equal to Ks.  If the Protocol-Specific Authentication Key
   (Ks) is more than L octets long, then Ko is set to H(Ks).  If the
   Protocol-Specific Authentication Key (Ks) is less than L octets long,
   then Ko is set to the Protocol-Specific Authentication Key (Ks) with
   zeros appended to the end of the Protocol-Specific Authentication Key
   (Ks) such that Ko is L octets long.

   Once the cryptographic key (Ko) used with the hash algorithm is
   derived the rest of the authentication mechanism described in
   [RFC5709] remains unchanged other than one detail that was
   unspecified.  When XORing Ko and Ipad of Opad, Ko MUST be padded with
   zeros to the length of Ipad or Opad.  It is expected that RFC 5709
   [RFC5709] implementations perform this padding implicitly.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document rectifies the manual key management procedure that
   currently exists within OSPFv2, as part of the Phase 1 of the KARP
   Working Group.  Therefore, only the OSPFv2 manual key management
   mechanism is considered.  Any solution that takes advantage of the
   automatic key management mechanism is beyond the scope of this
   document.

   The proposed sequence number extension offers most of the benefits of
   more complicated mechanisms involving challenges.  There are,
   however, a couple drawbacks to this approach.  First, it requires the
   OSPF implementation to be able to save its boot count in non-volatile
   storage.  If the non-volatile storage is ever repaired or upgraded
   such that the contents are lost or the OSPFv2 router is replaced, the
   keys MUST be changed to prevent replay attacks.

   Second, if a router is taken out of service completely (either
   intentionally or due to a persistent failure), the potential exists
   for reestablishment of an OSPFv2 adjacency by replaying the entire
   OSPFv2 session establishment.  This scenario is however, extremely
   unlikely, since it would imply an identical OSPFv2 adjacency
   formation packet exchange.  Without adjacency formation, the replay

   of OSPFv2 hello packets alone for an OSPFv2 router that has been
   taken out of service should not result in any serious attack as the
   only consequence is superfluous processing.  Of course, this attack
   could also be thwarted by changing the relevant manual keys.

   This document also provides a solution to prevent certain denial of
   service attacks that can be launched by changing the source address
   in the IP header of an OSPFv2 protocol packet.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests a new code point from the "OSPF Shortest Path
   First (OSPF) Authentication Codes" registry:

   o  3 - Cryptographic Authentication with Extended Sequence Numbers.

   This document also requests a new code point from the "Authentication
   Cryptographic Protocol ID" registry defined under "Keying and
   Authentication for Routing Protocols (KARP) Parameters":

   o  2 - OSPFv2.
