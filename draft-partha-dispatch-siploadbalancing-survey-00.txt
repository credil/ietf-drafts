Abstract

   SIP Load balancing across a farm of SIP servers can be done today,
   but without generally agreed upon principles on how to best do
   accomplish this.  Confounding the problem is that a SIP farm may
   consist of hosts with varying capabilities, example, a SIP proxy, a
   back-to-back user agent (B2BUA), a public-switched telephone system
   (PSTN) gateway, SIP Media servers etc.  The capabilities and
   processing capacity on hosts in the farm may be different, sometimes
   vastly, from each other.  This document present the survey of
   existing literature and common practice on SIP load balancing.

Internet-Draft          SIP Load balancing survey           January 2012


1.  Introduction

   Session Initiation protocol [RFC3261] Load balancing across a farm of
   SIP servers can be done today, but without generally agreed upon
   principles on how to best do accomplish this.  Confounding the
   problem is that a SIP farm may consist of hosts with varying
   capabilities, example, a SIP proxy, a back-to-back user agent
   (B2BUA), a public-switched telephone system (PSTN) gateway, SIP Media
   servers etc.  The capabilities and processing capacity on hosts in
   the farm may be different, sometimes vastly, from each other.
   Furthermore, the duration of time that a SIP host requires to process
   a SIP request may vary.  SIP proxies, operating at the transaction
   layer, may be more efficient at processing transactions than a B2BUA
   would be, which may need to maintain a long-lived dialogue state in
   addition to the transaction state.  PSTN gateways may have other
   limitations such as media resources that may be depleted even though
   the gateway may have enough processing power (i.e., CPU) to handle
   incoming requests.

   The goal of this draft is to summarize the contemporary SIP load
   balancing algorithm as input to the SIP load balancing protocol
   designers.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  This
   document only uses these key words when referencing normative
   statements in existing RFCs."


3.  Survey of existing mechanism & literature

3.1.  Round robin

   Round robin based on DNS is illustrated in [RFC1794].  The focus of
   this mechanism is load distribution than load balancing.

3.2.  Round robin with 503 or 302 or other overload mechanism

   TBD

3.3.  Round robin with option ping

   The load balancing device sends OPTIONS ping message to each of its
   downstream servers to determine if they are available.The return

   value in the OPTIONS response and in some cases the delay between the
   sending of the request and the response is tracked by the
   loadbalancer.  If the downstream server does not respond within a
   certain time window it is marked as down and not used in the round
   robin selection for the next request.  If the OPTIONS ping does
   respond the result code is often checked for a particular response.
   For instance a 200 value response will not change the current state
   of the downstream server while a response in the 5xx/6xx range or
   specific 4xx values will remove the downstream device from service.

   An alternate case of OPTIONS pings is to just use them to verify that
   a SIP UAS of some kind exists at the destination, any SIP response is
   considered a good response and marks the downstream device as valid.

   OPTIONS pings are sent to downstream entities even if they are
   currently marked as down or out of service on the loadbalancer.  When
   the device starts responding to the OPTIONS messages again it can
   then be placed back into the round robin selection.

   If the response to an OPTIONS request from a downstream host is
   successfully returned but is outside of an acceptable range, the
   loadbalancer can use this to indicate a problem with the downstream
   device and either remove it from the round robin, or change its
   portion of round robin traffic.

3.4.  DNS based

   Load Balancing based on Load Detection Function section in 3GPP TS 23
   .812(http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/23_series/23.812/
   23812-115.zip) illustrates DNS based SIP load balancing

3.5.  Resource availabilty based mechanism

   The media server load balancing depends upon the resources apart from
   CPU and Memory of the system.  Resource availability mechanism in (ht
   tp://tools.ietf.org/html/
   draft-partha-soc-overload-resource-availability-00) illustrate the
   way to achieve SIP based load balancing for media servers like PSTN-
   SIP GW, SBC.  Resource availabilty draft provides the mechanism
   wherein SIP server indicates its resource capability to the prior SIP
   server by which prior SIP server will be able to perform load
   balancing.

   Explicit polling: some protocol (SNMP/SOAP+XML/SIP) is used to
   actively probe the downstream server for their current resource
   availability.  The response to these polls are used to fill in the
   availability and resource allocation percentage of the downstream
   servers. continuous/streaming polling: a resource utilization report

   is included in each response (or every Nth response) from the
   downstream server through the load balancing device.  In this way no
   additional polling or protocol is needed to update resource
   availability, it is kept up to date by constant use.  This can easily
   be combined with OPTIONS pings. note: -multiple resources can be
   polled/used to figure out constraints.  For 1 downstream server might
   be out of a particular resource (such as transcoding resources), but
   have ample capacity to provide other services ( for example relaying
   MESSAGE requests).


4.  Standard open issues

   TBD


5.  Security Considerations

   This document is a survey of existing literature on SIP load
   balancing.  As such, it does not introduce any new security
   considerations to be taken into account beyond what is already
   discussed in each paper surveyed.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This is no IANA consideration applicable for this draft.
