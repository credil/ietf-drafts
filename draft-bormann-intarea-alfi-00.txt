               Adaptation Layer Fragmentation Indication
                     draft-bormann-intarea-alfi-00

Abstract

   IPv6 defines a minimum MTU of 1280 bytes.  Many link layers are more
   limited in their choice of packet size.  Typically, IP adaptation
   layers for these link layers define a segmentation or fragmentation
   scheme to transport larger IP packets in multiple link layer packets.

   Often, adaption layer fragmentation schemes reduce some performance
   metric, such as the packet delivery rate.  Where application or
   transport protocols have a choice, it would therefore be desirable
   for them to know about any adaptation layer fragmentation that is
   going on, so they can choose packet sizes that minimize adaptation
   layer fragmentation.

   At the IP layer, fragmentation can be detected using a number of
   mechanisms used in Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery [RFC4821].
   However, adaptation later fragmentation schemes are often designed to
   be "transparent", i.e. there is no way at higher layers to find out
   they had to be employed (except maybe by elaborate measurement
   schemes targeting one of the impacted performance metrics; this
   approach does not appear to be viable) [WEI].

   The present specification defines a mechanism for IPv6 adaptation
   layers to indicate the presence of adaptation layer fragmentation, as
   well as an indication of preferred packet sizes.

   The main objective of this version of the draft is to present a
   complete design in order to be able to gauge the complexity of the
   approach against the gains to be expected from implementing it.

   Comments are appreciated and should go to the intarea@ietf.org
   mailing list.

1.  Introduction

   (To be written - for now please read the Abstract.)

1.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this specification:

   ALF  Adaptation Layer Fragmentation

   MUALTU  Maximum Unfragmented Adaptation Layer Transmission Unit, i.e.
      the largest piece of IPV6 packet (measured in bytes) that can be
      transferred by the adaptation layer without invoking ALF

   IFMUALTU  Initial-Fragment MUALTU, the MUALTU for the initial
      adaptation layer fragment of an IP packet

   FFMUALTU  Following-Fragment MUALTU, the estimated minimum MUALTU for
      all but the initial adaptation layer fragments of an IP packet

   ALFI  Adaptation Layer Fragmentation Indication, i.e. indication that
      ALF was performed on a packet

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  They
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations [RFC2119].

   The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for
   "octet".

2.  Objectives and Considerations

   This draft is shaped by the requirements of 6LoWPAN networks
   [I-D.bormann-6lowpan-roadmap], including variants such as Bluetooth/
   Low Energy [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-btle] or DECT/ULE
   [I-D.mariager-6lowpan-v6over-dect-ule].  However, it should be
   beneficial with any adaptation layer that requires the use of ALF.

   One important consideration for ALFI is that the ALF scheme may not
   be able to provide a consistent MUALTU.  E.g., header compression may
   cause variable overheads, and initial and following fragments are
   likely to cause different MUALTUs.  Header compression may be
   dependent on the specific characteristics of the packets employed, so
   indications will be most accurate if they can be made on the basis of
   actual packets as they are intended to be transferred.

   Therefore, ALFI provides the ability to equip packets with a probe
   that collects for any adaptation layer fragmentation that may be
   available on the path.

   Note that probing for MUALTUs changes the MUALTU.  Implementations
   SHOULD attempt to indicate a MUALTU for a non-probe packet, i.e. the
   packet under consideration with the ALFI option (and its hop-by-hop
   header, if applicable) removed.  If that is not possible,
   implementations SHOULD err towards indicating smaller MUALTUs, within
   reason.

   Note that not all nodes will immediately implement ALFI.  ALFI just
   "fails ignorant" (but see below).

   Note that an adaptation layer instance may want to manipulate ALFI
   for other reasons than to indicate ALF (cf. "MSS clamping").  (In
   particular, while other nodes don't have ALFI yet, a border router
   such as a 6LBR [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd] may want to provide some ALFI
   guessing.)

   Generally speaking, ALFI can be used to indicate any significant,
   step function degradation of some performance metric based on packet
   size.

   ALFI SHOULD NOT be set for segmentation implementations with limited
   performance impact.  E.g., AAL5 implementations SHOULD NOT set ALFI.

3.  The ALFI option

   The ALFI option is an IPv6 option in the sense of section 4.2 of
   [RFC2460].  It is only used in the hop-by-hop header.

   The option type identifier is chosen to select the following behavior
   as detailed in section 4.2 of [RFC2460]:

   o  00 - skip over this option and continue processing the header
      (this enables the "fail-ignorant" backwards compatibility
      behavior)

   o  1 - Option Data may change en-route (the option is used to record
      information en-route)


     .                               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     .                               |0 0 1 x x x x x|       4       |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    Initial-Fragment MUALTU    |   Following-Fragment MUALTU   |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Figure 1

   In IFMUALTU and FFMUALTU, the value zero represents infinity.  All
   other values are unsigned integers in network byte order,
   representing a MUALTU in bytes.

   The originator of a packet MAY, for occasional probing, insert an
   ALFI option into packets where it can choose the packet size and the
   performance metrics of which are important to the application.

   When generating the packet, it sets Initial-Fragment MUALTU
   (IFMUALTU) and Following-Fragment MUALTU (FFMUALTU) to zero.  (Its
   adaptation layer can then update them as described in the following
   paragraphs.)

   Each instance of an adaptation layer that employs ALF computes its
   own estimate of IFMUALTU and FFMUALTU for the type of packet that has
   this option, ignoring the option itself and, if the option was the
   only option in the hop-by-hop header, the hop-by-hop header.  For
   each estimate, if it is below the existing value (where zero is
   infinity) of the respective field, the instance updates the field to
   the estimate.

   The receiver of the packet relays the information in the ALFI option
   to the transport layer and/or application.

   (TBD: How to ship this information through the IPv6 socket interface
   [RFC3493]/[RFC3542].  Constrained implementations won't have this
   specific problem.)

   The transport layer and/or application can then make this information
   available to the peer instance, which enables it to choose IPv6
   packet sizes of IFMUALTU or lower, or, if this cannot be achieved, at
   least below IFMUALTU+n*FFMUALTU for a small n.  For instance, in CoAP
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap], the Block2 option [I-D.ietf-core-block] can be
   used to negotiate a block size accordingly.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to allocate an IPv6 option number for the ALFI option,
   "Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options" registry in "Internet
   Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Parameters", with act=00 and chg=1 (i.e.,
   similar to the Quick-Start option [RFC4782]).

5.  Security Considerations

   It is hard to like hop-by-hop options from a security point of view.

   (This section will certainly grow as additional security
   considerations beyond those listed in the base specifications become
   known.)

   Peter van der Stok prompted the author to finally write up this
   protocol, a couple of years after the need for it had been shown in
   [WEI].
