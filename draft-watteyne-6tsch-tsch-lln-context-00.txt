1.  Introduction

   The IEEE802.15.4e standard [IEEE802154e] was published in 2012 as an
   amendment to the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol of the
   IEEE802.15.4-2011 [IEEE802154] standard.  The Timeslotted Channel
   Hopping (TSCH) mode of the IEEE802.15.4e standard is the object of
   this document.

   TSCH was designed to "allow IEEE802.15.4 devices to support a wide
   range of industrial applications" [IEEE802154e].  At its core is a
   medium access technique which uses time synchronization to achieve
   ultra low-power operation and channel hopping to enable high
   reliability.  This is very different from the "legacy" IEEE802.15.4
   MAC protocol, and is therefore better described as a "redesign".
   TSCH does not amend the physical layer; i.e. it can operate on any
   IEEE802.15.4-compliant hardware.

   IEEE802.15.4e can be seen as the latest generation of ultra-lower
   power and reliable networking solutions for LLNs.  Its core
   technology is similar to the one used in industrial networking
   technologies such as WirelessHART [WHART] or ISA100.11a [ISA100].
   These protocol solutions have been targeted essentially at the
   industrial market.  WirelessHART is for example the wireless
   extension of HART, a long standing protocol suite for networking
   industrial equipment.

   [RFC5673] discusses industrial applications, and highlights the harsh
   operating conditions as well as the stringent reliability,
   availability and security requirements for an LLN to operate in an
   industrial environment.  Industrial protocols such as WirelessHART
   satisfy those requirements, and with tens of thousands of networks
   deployed [Emerson], these types of networks have a large impact on
   industrial applications.  Commercial networking solutions are
   available today in which motes consume 10's of micro-amps on average
   [CurrentCalculator] with end-to-end packet delivery ratios over
   99.999% [Doherty].

   IEEE802.15.4e builds on the same foundations as WirelessHART, and
   therefore exhibits similar performance.  Yet, unlike an industrial
   protocol which is, by nature, application-specific, IEEE802.15.4e
   TSCH focuses on the MAC layer only.  This clean layering allows for
   TSCH to fit under an IPv6 enabled protocol stack for LLNs, running
   6LoWPAN [RFC6282], RPL [RFC6550] and CoAP [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

   Bringing industrial-like performance into the LLN stack developed by
   the 6LoWPAN, ROLL and CORE working groups will open up new
   application domains for these networks.  Sensors deployed in smart
   cities [RFC5548] will be able to be installed for years without

   needing battery replacement.  "Umbrella" networks will interconnect
   smart elements from different entities in smart buildings [RFC5867].
   Peel-and-stick switches will obsolete the need for costly conduits
   for lighting solutions in smart homes [RFC5826].

   While [IEEE802154e] defines the mechanisms for a TSCH mote to
   communicate, it does not define the policies to build and maintain
   the communication schedule, match that schedule to the multi-hop
   paths maintained by RPL, adapt the resources allocated between
   neighbor nodes to the data traffic flows, enforce a differentiated
   treatment for data generated at the application layer and signaling
   messages needed by 6LoWPAN and RPL to discover neighbors, react to
   topology changes, self-configuring IP addresses, or manage keying
   material.

2.  TSCH in the LLN Context

   In many cases, to map the services required by the IP layer to the
   services provided by the link layer, an adaptation layer is used
   [palattella12standardized].  The 6LoWPAN working group has started in
   2007 to work on specifications for transmitting IPv6 over
   IEEE802.15.4 networks [RFC4919].  Typically, low-power WPANs are
   characterized by small packet sizes, support for addresses with
   different lengths, low bandwidth, star and mesh topologies, battery
   powered devices, low cost, large number of devices, unknown node
   positions, high unreliability, and periods during which communication
   interfaces are turned off to save energy.  Given these features, it
   is clear that the adoption of IPv6 on top of a Low-Power WPAN is not
   straightforward, but poses strong requirements for the optimization
   of this adaptation layer.  For instance, due to the IPv6 default
   minimum MTU size (1280 bytes), an un-fragmented IPv6 packet would be
   too large to fit in an IEEE802.15.4 frame.  Moreover, the overhead
   due to the 40-byte long IPv6 header would waste the scarce bandwidth
   available at the PHY layer [RFC4944].  For these reasons, the 6LoWPAN
   working group has defined an effective adaptation layer [RFC6568].
   Further issues encompass the auto-configuration of IPv6 addresses
   [RFC2464][RFC6755], the compliance with the recommendation on
   supporting link-layer subnet broadcast in shared networks [RFC3819],
   the reduction of routing and management overhead [RFC6606], the
   adoption of lightweight application protocols (or novel data encoding
   techniques), and the support for security mechanisms (confidentiality
   and integrity protection, device bootstrapping, key establishment,
   and management).

   These features can run on top of TSCH.  There are, however, important
   issues to solve, as highlighted in Section 3.

   Routing issues are challenging for 6LoWPAN, given the low-power and
   lossy radio-links, the battery supplied nodes, the multi-hop mesh
   topologies, and the frequent topology changes due to mobility.
   Successful solutions take into account the specific application
   requirements, along with IPv6 behavior and 6LoWPAN mechanisms
   [palattella12standardized].  The ROLL working group has defined RPL
   in [RFC6550].  RPL can support a wide variety of link layers,
   including ones that are constrained, potentially lossy, or typically
   utilized in conjunction with host or router devices with very limited
   resources, as in building/home automation [RFC5867][RFC5826],
   industrial environments [RFC5673], and urban applications [RFC5548].
   It is able to quickly build up network routes, to distribute routing
   knowledge among nodes, and to adapt the topology.  In a typical
   setting, motes are connected through multi-hop paths to a small set
   of root devices, which are usually responsible for data collection
   and coordination duties.  For each of them, a Destination Oriented

   Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) is created by accounting for link
   costs, node attributes/status information, and an Objective Function,
   which maps the optimization requirements of the target scenario.  The
   topology is set-up based on a Rank metric, which encodes the distance
   of each node with respect to its reference root, as specified by the
   Objective Function.  Regardless of the way it is computed, the Rank
   monotonically decreases along the DODAG towards the destination,
   following a gradient-based approach.  RPL encompasses different kinds
   of traffic and signaling information.  Multipoint-to-Point (MP2P) is
   the dominant traffic in LLN applications.  Data is routed towards
   nodes with some application relevance, such as the LLN gateway to the
   larger Internet, or to the core of private IP networks.  In general,
   these destinations are the DODAG roots and they act as data
   collection points for distributed monitoring applications.  Point-to-
   Multipoint (P2MP) data streams are used for actuation purposes, where
   messages are sent from DODAG roots to destination nodes.  Point-to-
   Point (P2P) traffic allows communication between two devices
   belonging to the same LLN, e.g. a sensor and an actuator.  A packet
   will flow from the source towards the common ancestor of those two
   communicating devices, then downward towards the destination.  As an
   consequence, RPL has to discover both upward routes (i.e., from nodes
   to DODAG roots) in order to enable MP2P and P2P flows, and downward
   routes (i.e., from DODAG roots to nodes) to support P2MP and P2P
   traffic.

   Section 3 highlights the challenges that need to be addressed to use
   RPL on top of TSCH.

   Several open-source initiatives have emerged around TSCH.  The
   OpenWSN project [OpenWSN][OpenWSNETT] is an open-source
   implementation of a fully standards-based protocol stack, which aims
   at evaluating the applicability of TSCH to different applications.
   This implementation was used as the foundation for an IP for Smart
   Objects Alliance (IPSO) [IPSO] iteroperability demo in 2011.  In the
   absence of a standardized scheduling mechanism for TSCH, a "slotted
   Aloha" schedule was used.

3.  Problems and Goals

   As highlighted in Appendix A, TSCH is different for traditional low-
   power MAC protocols because of its scheduled nature.  TSCH defines
   the mechanisms to execute a communication schedule, but it is the
   entity that sets up that schedule which controls the topology of the
   network, and the resources allocated to each link in that topology.

   How this entity should operate is out of scope of TSCH.  The
   remainder of this section highlights the problems this entity needs
   to address.  For simplicity, we will refer to this entity by the
   generic name "6TSCH", without loss of generality.  In particular, we
   do not assume the nature of 6TSCH, whether an adaptation layer, a
   distributed reservation protocol, a centralized path computation
   engine, or any combination thereof.

3.1.  Network Formation

   6TSCH needs to control the way the network is formed, including how
   new motes join, and how already joined motes advertise the presence
   of the network. 6TSCH needs to:

   1.  Define the Information Elements to include in Enhanced Beacons
       advertising the presence of the network.

   2.  For a new mote, define rules to process and filter received
       Enhanced Beacons.  This includes a mechanism to select the best
       mote to join the network through.

   3.  Define the joining procedure.  This includes a mechanism to
       assign a unique 16-bit address to a mote, and the management of
       initial keying material.

3.2.  Network Maintenance

   Once a network is formed, 6TSCH needs to maintain the network's
   health, allowing for motes to stay synchronized. 6TSCH needs to:

   1.  Manage each mote's time source neighbor(s).

   2.  Define a mechanism for a mote to update the join priority it
       announces in its Enhanced Beacon.

   3.  Schedule transmissions of an Enhanced Beacon to advertise the
       presence of the network.

Internet-Draft           6tsch-tsch-lln-context            February 2013


3.3.  Multi-Hop Topology

   RPL, given a weighted connectivity graph, determines multi-hop
   routes. 6TSCH needs to:

   1.  Define a mechanism whereby it gathers topological information,
       which it can then feed to RPL.

   2.  Ensure that the TSCH schedule contains links along the multi-hop
       routes identified by RPL.

   3.  Where applicable, maintain independent sets of links to transport
       independent flows of data.

3.4.  Routing and Timing Parents

   At all times, a TSCH mote needs to have at least one time source
   neighbor it can synchronize to. 6TSCH therefore needs to assign time
   source neighbors to allow for correct operation of the TSCH network.
   These time source neighbors could, or not, be related to RPL time
   parents.

3.5.  Resource Management

   A link in a TSCH schedule is a "unit" of resource.  The number of
   links to assign between neighbor motes needs to be appropriate for
   the size of the traffic flow. 6TSCH needs to:

   1.  Define rules on when to create or delete a slotframes.

   2.  Define rules to determine the length of a slotframe, and the
       trigger to modify the length of a slotframe.

   3.  Define rules on when to add or delete links in a particular
       slotframe.

   4.  Define a mechanism for neighbor nodes to exchange information
       about their schedule and, if applicable, negotiate the addition/
       deletion of links.

   5.  Allow for a (possibly centralized) entity to take full control
       over the schedule.

   6.  Define a set of metrics to evaluate the tradeoff between latency,
       bandwidth and energy consumption achieved by a particular
       schedule.

3.6.  Dataflow Control

   TSCH defines mechanisms for a mote to signal it cannot accept an
   incoming packet.  It does not, however, define the policy which
   determines when not to accept. 6TSCH need to:

   1.  Define a queueing policy for incoming and outgoing packets.

   2.  Manage the buffer space and indicate to TSCH when to stop
       accepting incoming packet.

   3.  Handle transmissions that have failed.

3.7.  Secure Communication

   Given some keying material, TSCH defines mechanisms to encrypt and
   authenticate MAC frames.  It does not define how this keying material
   is generated. 6TSCH need to:

   1.  Define the keying material and authentication mechanism needed by
       a new mote to join an existing network.

   2.  Define a mechanism to allow for the secure transfer of
       application data between neighbor motes.

   3.  Define a mechanism to allow for the secure transfer of signaling
       data between motes and 6TSCH.

Appendix A.  TSCH Protocol Highlights

   This appendix gives an overview of the key features of the
   IEEE802.15.4e Timeslotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) amendment.  It makes
   no attempt at repeating the standard, but rather focuses on the
   following:

   o  Concepts which are sufficiently different from traditional
      IEEE802.15.4 networking that they may need to be defined and
      presented precisely.

   o  Techniques and ideas which are part of IEEE802.15.4e and which
      might be useful for the work of 6TSCH.

A.1.  Timeslots

   All motes in a TSCH network are synchronized.  Time is sliced up into
   time slots.  A time slot is long enough for a MAC frame of maximum
   size to be sent from mote A to mote B, and for mote B to reply with
   an acknowledgment (ACK) frame indicating successful reception.

   The duration of a timeslot is not defined by the standard.  With
   IEEE802.15.4-compliant radios operating in the 2.4GHz frequency band,
   a maximum-length frame of 127 bytes takes about 4ms to transmit; a
   shorter ACK takes about 1ms.  With a 10ms slot (a typical duration),
   this leaves 5ms to radio turnaround, packet processing and security
   operations.

A.2.  Slotframes

   Timeslots are grouped into one of more slotframes.  A slotframe
   continuously repeats over time.  TSCH does not impose any slotframe
   size.  Depending on the application needs, these can range from 10s
   to 1000s of timeslots.  The shorter the slotframe, the more often a
   timeslot repeats, resulting in more available bandwidth, but also in
   a higher power consumption.

A.3.  Mote Communication Schedule

   A communication schedule instructs each mote what to do in each slot:
   transmit, receive or sleep.  The schedule indicates, for each active
   (transmit or receive) timeslot a channelOffset and the address of the
   neighbor to communicate with.

   Once a mote obtains its schedule, it executes it:

   o  For each transmit slot, the mote checks whether there is a packet
      in the outgoing buffer which matches the neighbor written in the



Watteyne                 Expires August 12, 2013               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft           6tsch-tsch-lln-context            February 2013


      schedule information for that slot.  If there is none, the mote
      keeps its radio off for the duration of the slot.  If there is
      one, the mote can ask for the neighbor to acknowledge it, in which
      case it has to listen for the acknowledgment after the
      transmission.

   o  For each receive slot, the mote listens for possible incoming
      packets.  If none is received after some listening period, it
      shuts down its radio.  If a packet is received, addressed to the
      mote, and passes security checks, the mote typically sends back
      and aknowledgment.

   How the schedule is built, updated and maintained, and by which
   entity, is outside of the scope of the IEEE802.15.4e standard.

A.4.  Links and Paths

   Assuming the schedule is well built, if mote A is scheduled to
   transmit to mote B at slotOffset 5 and channelOffset 11, mote B will
   be scheduled to receive from mote A at the same slotOffset and
   channelOffset.

   A single slot of the schedule (i.e., a single cell of the grid),
   characterized by a slotOffset and channelOffset, and reserved for
   mote A to transmit to mote B (or for mote B to receive from mote A),
   is called a "link".

   If there is a lot of data flowing from mote A to mote B, the schedule
   might contain multiple slots from A to B, at different times.
   Multiple links scheduled to the same neighbor are typically
   equivalent, i.e. the MAC layer sends the packet on whichever of these
   links happens to show up after the packet was put in the MAC queue.
   The union of all links between two neighbors, A and B, is called a
   "path".  Since the slotframe repeats over time (and the length of the
   slotframe is typically constant), each link gives a "quantum" of
   bandwidth to a given neighbor.  Modifying the number of links in a
   path modify the amount of resources allocated between two neighbors.

A.5.  Dedicated vs. Shared Slots

   By default, each transmit timeslot within the TSCH schedule is
   dedicated, i.e., reserved only for mote A to transmit to mote B.
   IEEE802.15.4e allows also to mark a slot as shared.  In a shared
   slot, multiple motes can transmit at the same time, on the same
   fequency.  To avoid contention, TSCH defines a back-off algorithm for
   shared slots.

   A slot can be marked as both transmitting and receiving.  In this



Watteyne                 Expires August 12, 2013               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft           6tsch-tsch-lln-context            February 2013


   case, a mote transmits if it has an appropriate packet in its output
   buffer, or listens otherwise.  Marking a slot as
   [transmit,shared,receive] results in slotted-Aloha behavior.

A.6.  Absolute Slot Number

   TSCH defines a timeslot counter called Absolute Slot Number (ASN).
   When a new network is created, the ASN is initialized to 0; from then
   on it increments by 1 at each timeslot.  In detail:

   ASN = (k*S+t)

   where S is the slotframe size and k the slotframe cycle (i.e., the
   number of slotframe occurences over time).  A mote learns the current
   ASN when it joins the network.  Since motes are synchronized, they
   all know the current value of the ASN, and any time.  The ASN is
   encoded as a 5-byte number: this allows it to increment for hundreds
   of years (the exact value depends on the duration of a timeslot)
   without wrapping.  The ASN is used (i) to calculate the frequency to
   communicate on, jointly with the channelOffset, (ii) to build unique
   security nonce counters, when the CCM* mode is activated.

A.7.  Channel Hopping

   For each active slot, the schedule specifies a timeOffset and a
   channelOffset.  In a well-built schedule, when mote A has a transmit
   slot to mote B on channelOffset 5, mote B has a receive slot from
   mote A on the same channelOffset.  The channelOffset, is translated
   by both nodes into a frequency using the following function:

   frequency = F {(ASN + channelOffset) mod nCh}

   The function F consists of a look-up table containing the set of
   available channels.  The value nCh (the number of available
   frequencies) is the size of this look-up table.  There are as many
   channelOffset values as there are frequencies available (e.g. 16 when
   using IEEE802.15.4-compliant radios at 2.4GHz, when all channels are
   used).  Since both motes have the same channelOffset written in their
   schedule for that timeslot, and the same ASN counter since they are
   synchronized, they compute the same frequency.  At the next iteration
   (cycle) of the slotframe, however, the channelOffset will be the
   same, but the ASN will have changed, resulting in the computation of
   a different frequency.  If the slotframe size, S (used for computing
   ASN), and the number of channel offsets, nCh, are relatively prime,
   the translation function ensures that each link rotates through k
   available channels over k slotframe cycles.  This results in "channel
   hopping": even with a static schedule, pairs of neighbors "hop"
   between the different frequencies when communicating.



Watteyne                 Expires August 12, 2013               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft           6tsch-tsch-lln-context            February 2013


   The look-up table F can be built to contain only a subset of all
   available channels.  This results in "blacklisting".

   Channel hopping is a technique known to efficiently combat multi-path
   fading and external interference.  This results in a TSCH network
   having a more stable topology than if only a single channel were used
   for the entire network.

A.8.  Time Synchronization

   Because of the slotted nature of communication in a TSCH network,
   motes have to maintain tight synchronization.  All motes are assumed
   to be equipped with clocks to keep track of time (32kHz crystal
   oscillators are typically used).  Yet, because clocks in different
   motes drift with respect to one another, neighbor motes need to
   periodically re-synchronize.

   TSCH adds timing information in all packets that are exchanged (both
   data and ACK frames).  This means that neighbor motes can
   resynchronize to one another whenever they exchange data.  The
   schedule of a mote indicates which of its neighbor(s) are its "time
   source neighbors".  When a mote communicates with one of its time
   source neighbors, it uses the timing information in the exchanged
   frames to realign its clock to its neighbor's.

   It is up to the entity that manages the schedule to assign adequate
   time source neighbor(s) to each mote.  It is important to avoid
   synchronization loops, which could result in the formation of
   independent clusters of motes.

A.9.  Power Consumption

   There are only a handful of activities a mote can perform during a
   timeslot: transmit, receive, or sleep.  Depending on the the hardware
   used, each of these operations has some energy cost associated to
   them.  Given the schedule of a mote, it is straighforward to
   calculate the expected average power consumption of that mote.

A.10.  Network Communication Schedule

   The schedule defines entirely the synchronization and communication
   between motes.  By adding/removing link between neighbors, one can
   adapt a schedule to the needs of the application.  Intuitive examples
   are:

   o  Make the schedule "sparse" for applications where motes need to
      consume as little as possible, at the price of reduced bandwidth.




Watteyne                 Expires August 12, 2013               [Page 21]

Internet-Draft           6tsch-tsch-lln-context            February 2013


   o  Make the schedule "dense" for applications where motes generate a
      lot of data, at the price of increased power consumption.

   o  Add more links along a multi-hop route over which many packets
      flow.

A.11.  Join Process

   Motes already part of the network can periodically send Enhanced
   Beacon (EB) frames to announce the presence the network.  These
   contain information about the size of the timeslot used in the
   network, the current ASN, information about the slotframes and
   timeslots the beaconing mote is listening on, and a 1-byte join
   priority.  This join priority corresponds to the number of hops
   separating the mote sending the EB, and the PAN coordinator.  Because
   of the channel hopping nature of TSCH, these EB frames are sent on
   all frequencies.

   A mote wishing to join the network listens on some frequency for EBs.
   It can wait to receive multiple, and can use the join priority in
   those EBs to identify the best mote to join the network through.
   Using the ASN and the other timing information of the EB, the new
   mote synchronizes to the network.  Using the slotframe and link
   information from te EB, it knows how to contact the mote it just
   joined.

   The TSCH standard does not define the steps beyond this "kickstart".
   These steps can include a security handshake and the addition of more
   communication links to the new mote's schedule.

A.12.  Information Elements

   TSCH introduces the concept of Information Elements (IES).  An
   information element is a list of Type-Length-Value containers placed
   at the end of the MAC header.  A small number of types are defined
   for TSCH (e.g., the ASN in the EB is contained in an IE), but an
   unmanaged range is available for extensions.

   A bit in the MAC header indicates whether the frame contains IEs.
   IEs are grouped into Header IEs, consumed by the MAC layer and
   therefore typically invisible to the next higher layer, and Payload
   IEs, which are passed untouched to the next higher layer, possibly
   followed by regular payload.  Payload IEs can therefore be used for
   the next higher layers of two neighbor motes to exchange information.

A.13.  Extensibility

   The TSCH standard is designed to be extensible.  It introduces the
   mechanisms as "building block" (e.g. links, frame, etc.), but leaves
   entire freedom to the upper layer to assemble those.  The MAC
   protocol can be extended by defining new Header IEs.  An intermediate
   layer can be defined to manage the MAC layer by defining Payload IEs.

Appendix B.  TSCH Gotchas

   This section lists features of TSCH which we believe are important
   and beneficial to the work of 6TSCH.

B.1.  Collision Free Communication

   TSCH allows you to easily design a schedule which yields collision-
   free communication.  This is done by building the schedule in such a
   way that at most one link occupies each slotOffset/channelOffset
   cell.  Multiple pairs of neighbor motes can exchange data at the same
   time, but on different frequencies.  If a deployment is done over a
   large area, slotOffset/channelOffset cells can be reused by pairs of
   neigbors sufficiently far appart not to interfere.

B.2.  Multi-Channel vs. Channel Hopping

   A TSCH schedule looks like a matrix of width "slotFrame length" and
   height "number of channels".  For a scheduling algorithm, these can
   be considered atomic "units" to schedule.  In particular, because of
   the channel hopping nature of TSCH, the scheduling algorithm should
   not worry about the actual frequency communication happens on, since
   it changes at each slotFrame iteration.

B.3.  Cost of (continuous) Synchronization

   In the absence of data traffic, a mote is required to synchronize to
   its time source neighbor(s) periodically not to drift in time.  The
   period at which this needs to happen depends on the stability of the
   clock source, and on how "early" each mote starts listening for data
   (the "guard time").  Theoretically, with a 10ppm clock and a 1ms
   guard time, this period can be 100s.  Resynchronizing consists in
   sending any valid frame to the time source neighbor and using the
   timing information in the ACK to realign the clocks.  If this
   exchange causes the mote's radio to be on for 5ms, this yields a
   radio duty cycle needed to keep synchronized of 5ms/100s=0.005%.
   While TSCH does requires motes to resynchronize periodically, the
   cost of doing so in almost negligible.

B.4.  Topology Stability

   The channel hopping nature of TSCH causes links to be very "stable".
   Wireless phenomena such as multi-path fading and external
   interference impact a wireless link between two motes differently on
   each frequency.  It a transmission from mote A to mote B fails,
   retransmitting on a different frequency has a higher likelihood of
   succeeding that retransmitting on the same frequency.  As a result,
   even when some frequencies are "behaving bad", channel hopping

   "smoothens" the contribution of each frequency, resulting in more
   stable links, and therefore a more stable topology.

B.5.  Multiple Concurrent Slotframes

   The TSCH standard allows for multiple slotframes to coexist in a
   mote's schedule.  It is possible that at some slot, a mote has
   multiple activities scheduled (e.g. transmit to mote 0xfeed on
   slotFrame 2, receive from mote 0xbeef on slotFrame 1).  To handle
   this situation, the TSCH standard defines the following precedence
   rules:

   1.  Transmissions take precedence over receptions;

   2.  Lower slotframe identifiers take precedence over higher slotframe
       identifiers.

   In the example above, the mote would transmit to mote 0xfeed on
   slotFrame 2.
