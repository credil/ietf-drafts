Internet-Draft                 URN Syntax                      July 2013


1.  Introduction

   A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   [RFC3986] that is intended to serve as a persistent, location-
   independent resource identifier.  This document defines the canonical
   syntax for URIs under the "urn" scheme, guidelines for URN
   namespaces, requirements for URN presentation and transmission, and
   methods for determining URN equivalence.

   URNs were originally defined in [RFC2141].  The goal of this document
   is to specify URNs with the smallest reasonable set of changes from
   the original definition while ensuring consistency with the updated
   specification of URIs in [RFC3986].

   This document obsoletes RFC 2141.


2.  Terminology

   Several important terms used in this document are defined in the URI
   specification [RFC3986].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements

   The requirements for URNs are specified in [RFC1737].  This document
   does not modify or update those requirements.


4.  URN Syntax

   The syntax for a URN is defined as follows using the Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as specified in [RFC5234].

      namestring    = assigned-name [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]
                    ;
                    ; query and fragment are defined in RFC 3986
                    ;
      assigned-name = "urn" ":" NID ":" NSS
                    ;
                    ; the URI scheme ("urn") is case-insensitive
                    ;
      NID           = (alphanum) 0*30(ldh) (alphanum)
                    ;
                    ; alphanum is defined in RFC 3986
                    ;
      ldh           = alphanum / "-"
      NSS           = 1*(pchar)
                    ;
                    ; pchar is defined in RFC 3986
                    ;

   The following sections describe provide additional information about
   these rules.

4.1.  Namespace Identifier Syntax

   The syntax here is slightly more restrictive than what was defined in
   [RFC2141], since it forbids the character "-" at the end of a NID.

   NIDs are case insensitive (e.g., "ISBN" and "isbn" are equivalent).

4.2.  Namespace Specific String Syntax

   Depending on the rules governing a namespace, names that are valid in
   a namespace might contain characters that are not allowed in URNs
   according to the "pchar" rule (e.g., characters outside the ASCII
   range or characters that are reserved in URIs, such as "/", "?", and
   "#").  Such a string MUST be translated into a conformant NSS before
   using it as a protocol element or otherwise passing it on to other
   applications.  Translation is done by percent-encoding each
   disallowed character using the method defined in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC3986].  Note that the "%" character is allowed only for the
   purpose of percent-encoding.

   If a namespace designates one or more characters conforming to the
   "pchar" rule as having special meaning for that namespace (e.g., "@")
   and the namespace also uses that character in a literal sense, when
   used in a literal sense the character MUST be percent-encoded (e.g.,
   "%40").  For related considerations with regard to NID registration,
   see [I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc3406bis-urn-ns-reg].

Internet-Draft                 URN Syntax                      July 2013


4.3.  Query Component and Fragment Identifier Component

   The URI specification [RFC3986] allows a query component, a fragment
   identifier component, or both after the path component of a URI,
   where the character '?' is used as a separator to denote the
   beginning of the query component and the character '#' is used as a
   separator to denote the beginning of the fragment identifier
   component.  The original URN syntax specification [RFC2141] reserved
   the '?' and '#' characters for future developments.  This
   specification aligns URN syntax with URI syntax by allowing the query
   component and fragment identifier component after (not within) the
   Namespace Specific String (NSS).

   This specification does not define the applicability and semantics of
   the query component or the fragment identifier component in URNs.
   Additional specifications might establish these matters for URN-
   related services (such as resolution) or for individual URN
   namespaces.  For example, it is possible that the query component
   might be used in requests to URN resolution services, or that the
   fragment identifier component might be used to distinguish the
   integral parts of resources named by URNs.  However, defining such
   usage is left to specifications for URN resolution services,
   namespace registration requests and specifications for individual
   namespaces (which might use some namespace-specific syntax instead of
   the URI fragment identifier component), and other appropriate
   documentation (such as policy documents governing the management of a
   given URN namespace).

   Although URN assignment is often a managed process (see
   [I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc3406bis-urn-ns-reg]), the query component or
   fragment identifier component can be appended after the NSS once a
   URN has been assigned in accordance with the rules for a given
   namespace.


5.  URN Presentation and Transport

   The URN syntax defines the canonical format for URNs.  All URN
   transport and interchanges MUST take place in this format.  Further,
   all URN-aware applications MUST offer the option of displaying URNs
   in this canonical form to allow for direct transcription (for example
   by cut and paste techniques).  Such applications might support
   display of URNs in a more human-friendly form and might use a
   character set that includes characters that are not permitted in URN
   syntax as defined in this RFC (i.e., when displaying URNs to humans,
   such applications might replace percent-encoded strings with
   characters in an extended character set such as Unicode).

6.  Lexical Equivalence in URNs

6.1.  Procedure

   For various purposes such as caching, often it is desirable to
   determine if two URNs are "the same".  This is done by testing for
   "lexical equivalence".

   Two URNs are lexically equivalent if they are octet-by-octet equal
   after applying case normalization (as specified in Section 6.2.2.1 of
   [RFC3986]) to the following constructs:

   1.  the URI scheme "urn"
   2.  the NID
   3.  any percent-encoded characters (see Section 2.1 of [RFC3986])

   Percent-encoded characters MUST NOT be decoded, i.e., percent-
   encoding normalization (as specified in Section 6.2.2.2 of [RFC3986])
   MUST NOT be applied.

   If a query component, fragment identifier component, or both have
   been appended to the assigned URI, they MUST be ignored for purposes
   of determining lexical equivalence.

   URN namespaces MAY define additional rules for lexical equivalence,
   such as case-insensitivity of the NSS (or parts thereof).  Such rules
   MUST always have the effect of eliminating some of the false
   negatives obtained by the procedure above and MUST NOT result in
   treating two URNs as not equivalent if the procedure here says they
   are equivalent.  For related considerations with regard to NID
   registration, see [I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc3406bis-urn-ns-reg].

6.2.  Examples

   The following URN comparisons (which use the "example" NID defined in
   [RFC6963]) highlight the lexical equivalence rules:

   1.  URN:example:a123,456
   2.  urn:example:a123,456
   3.  urn:EXAMPLE:a123,456
   4.  urn:example:A123,456
   5.  urn:example:a123%2C456
   6.  URN:EXAMPLE:a123%2c456

   URNs 1, 2, and 3 are lexically equivalent.  URN 4 is not lexically
   equivalent to any of the other URNs in the above set.  URNs 5 and 6
   are lexically equivalent only to each other.

7.  Functional Equivalence in URNs

   Functional equivalence is determined within a given namespace and
   managed by resolvers for that namespace, and thus is beyond the scope
   of this document.  For related considerations with regard to NID
   registration, see [I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc3406bis-urn-ns-reg].


8.  Handling of URNs by URI Processors

   The URN syntax has been defined so that URNs can be used in places
   where URIs are expected.  A resolver that conforms to the URI
   specification [RFC3986] will extract a scheme of "urn" rather than a
   scheme value of "urn:<nid>".

   A URN MUST be considered an opaque URI by URI resolvers and passed
   (with the "urn" scheme) to a URN resolver for resolution.  The URN
   resolver can either be an external resolver that the URI resolver
   knows of, or it can be functionality built-in to the URI resolver.

   To minimize user confusion, a URI browser SHOULD display the complete
   URN (including the "urn" scheme) to ensure that there is no confusion
   between URN namespace identifiers and URL scheme identifiers.


9.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies the syntax for URNs.  While some namespaces
   resolvers might assign special meaning to certain of the characters
   of the Namespace Specific String, any security considerations
   resulting from such assignment are outside the scope of this
   document.  For related considerations with regard to NID
   registration, see [I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc3406bis-urn-ns-reg].


10.  IANA Considerations

   This section formally registers a URI scheme of 'urn'.

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace "XXXX" with the number assigned
   to this document upon publication.]
