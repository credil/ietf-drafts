The TCP MD5 Signature Option (RFC 2385), used
predominantly by BGP, has seen significant deployment in critical
areas of Internet infrastructure.  The security of this option relies
heavily on the quality of the keying material used to compute the MD5
signature.  This document addresses the security requirements of that
keying material.

This document is a product of the Inter-Domain Routing Working Group
