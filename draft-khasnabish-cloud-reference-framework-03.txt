                       Cloud Reference Framework
           draft-khasnabish-cloud-reference-framework-03.txt

Abstract

   This document presents a cloud reference framework.  In general, a
   cloud-based system utilizes virtualized computing/communications/
   storage resources and applications.  In the emerging cloud-based
   systems, virtualized infrastructures and services are provisioned on
   on-demand basis, and configured for specific customer needs or tasks.
   The reference framework is based on the survey of the SDOs and WGs
   that are focusing on cloud-based systems and services (Cloud SDO,
   I-D.Khasnabish-cloud-sdo-survey) and other research and developments
   in the cloud technology area.  Both intra-cloud and inter-cloud
   reference frameworks are presented and the requirements of each layer
   are discussed.

Internet-Draft          Cloud Reference Framework              June 2012


1.  Introduction

   Clouds are emerging as a common way of provisioning virtualised
   infrastructure services that are provisioned on demand (and
   configured for specific customer needs or tasks).  Current
   development of the cloud technologies demonstrate movement to
   developing Intercloud models, architectures and integration tools
   that could allow integrating cloud based infrastructure services into
   existing enterprise and campus infrastructures, on one hand, and
   provide common/interoperable environment for moving existing
   infrastructures and infrastructure services to virtualised cloud
   environment.  More complex and enterprise oriented use of cloud
   infrastructure services will require developing new service
   provisioning and security models that could allow creating complex
   project and group oriented infrastructures provisioned on-demand and
   across multiple providers.

   This document presents a general cloud reference framework that
   includes the proposed multilayer Cloud Services Model (CSM) and
   defines the Intercloud framework to address interoperability and
   integration issues in provisioning multi-domain heterogeneous cloud
   based infrastructures and services.

   The proposed CSM defines the basic functional layers to support the
   cloud based infrastructure services and applications virtualization,
   composition, delivery and operation.  The CSM provides a basis for
   building Cloud Service Provider (CSP) internal infrastructure (or
   datacenter) that could also address inter-provider interoperability
   and cloud based services integration.

   The proposed Intercloud (Architecture) Framework (ICF/ICAF) addresses
   a number of issues in ensuring interoperability of cloud
   infrastructures built using different cloud software stacks/platform
   and provided by multiple providers.  It should address Intercloud
   service control and management (under one cloud operator or
   integrator), Intercloud federation that should allow interoperability
   and integration of administratively independent cloud domains, and
   general cloud services provisioning and operation.

   The proposed in this document Intercloud Framework intends to provide
   a basis for inter-cloud infrastructures and services integration and
   interoperability that could span multiple providers, multiple
   management domains and include mutli-platform and multi-technology
   components/domains.  The definition of the Intercloud Framework is
   based on previous experience of (of Internet community in) building
   large scale interoperable telecommunication and Internet systems and
   uses best practices and recommendations from the wide range of
   industry standards by IETF, OGF, ITU-T, TMF, DMTF and other

   standardisation bodies specifically oriented on cloud technologies.

   The presented Cloud reference framework can be used to a) define
   requirements to the main cloud infrastructure functional elements and
   other components of the general Internet infrastructure to
   consistently support cloud services/infrastructure, b) define the
   interfaces between the functional elements, and c) propose further
   standardisation.

   It is important to mention that correct/consistent defintion of the
   general Cloud Services Model will provide a basis for seamless/smooth
   inter-cloud integration and operation.

   We develop a general cloud reference framework.  This reference
   framework describes basic functions in different layers to support
   the requirements of virtualized applications and services.  This
   reference framework can be used to standardize a) features of
   functional elements and b) the interfaces between the functions.

   Basically, the cloud reference framework includes

   o  Five horizontal layers

      *  Data/Content Layer(DCL)

      *  Application/Service Layer(ASL)

      *  Resource Control Layer(RCL)

      *  Resource Abstract and Virtualization Layer(RAVL)

      *  Physical Resource Layer(PRL)

   o  One stacked vertical layer to support

      *  Configuration management, registry, logging and auditing,
         security management, and service level agreement (SLA)
         management

   The Cloud Services Model includes another important components the
   security services (infrastructure) which task is to ensure normal
   operation of cloud services, protect user data, and enforce security,
   access control (authentication and authorisation) and operational
   policies at all layers of the cloud services model.  In clouds,
   security services also need to be provisioned together with the
   provisioned on-demand main cloud services; in this respect cloud
   security infrastructure should support consistent security context
   and security sessions management during the whole lifecycle of the

3.1.  HORIZONTAL/CSM LAYERS

3.1.1.  Application/Service Layer

   Application/Service Layer defines the requirements of the basic
   functional entities based on the virtual resources needed to perform
   any tasks.  The tasks are classified according to the 3 services



Khasnabish, et al.      Expires December 30, 2012               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          Cloud Reference Framework              June 2012


   models IaaS, PaaS & SaaS.  Some cloud services are illustrated as an
   example of applications like:

   o  Server, desktop, database and VLAN for IaaS,

   o  Development environment and test environment for PaaS,

   o  Business, consumer, network and communication applications for
      SaaS.

   The requirements the basic functional entities provided include the
   following characteristics and parameters of the virtual resources:

   o  Type of resources: CPU, memory, hard disk space, bandwidth,
      latency, jitter, and so on

   o  Amount of resources

   o  Nature of the resources: dedicated vs. shared, transport media
      exclusions, and so on

   o  Timing of the resources: scheduled vs. on-demand

   o  Duration of the Resources

3.1.2.  Resources Control Layer

   Resources Control Layer manages the virtual resources, ensuring that
   the resources are efficient, secure and reliable.  With the interface
   of virtual resources, the layer integrates the resources as a whole
   supplied to upper layer.  The layer has the following
   responsibilities:

   o  Resource security management.  Resources must be accessed and
      owned by the right user, there are several function modules to
      fulfill this responsibility, include resource admission control,
      resource authentication and authorization control;

   o  Resource schedule control.  The layer manages resources in form of
      resource pool.  In a resource pool, the layer balances the virtual
      resources on a set of physical equipments to achieve higher
      hardware utilization.  Virtual resources can be migrated between
      physical equipments if necessary, and also can be allocated
      according to user's priority grade.

   o  Inter-cloud resource control.  Resources in a cloud can be shared
      with another cloud in some circumstances, so a cloud must control
      resources in other cloud, and supply cloud service to end users.



Khasnabish, et al.      Expires December 30, 2012              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          Cloud Reference Framework              June 2012


      End users have no need to know where the resources are from.

   o  Resource availability control.  The layer supports fault-tolerance
      on resources.  It can allocate another copy of resources as a
      backup, and switch over when some faults raised.

   o  Services Lifecycle Management.  This functional component is
      needed to support resources provisioning process/staes for an
      instant cloud infrastructure or service.

3.1.3.  Resources Abstraction and Virtualization Layer

   Physical resources at the lowest level are the most complex to share
   among multiple users.  There are several hardware details that don't
   need to visible to users, so we need a level of abstraction.  In
   fact, these physical resources are abstracted first, next composed by
   the cloud management software (at composition and abstraction layer)
   and finally deployed as virtual resources on the virtualised physical
   resources.  The function of resources abstraction and virtualization
   layer is to convert physical resources to virtual resources.  Virtual
   resources are contained in resource pool.  Resources can be allocated
   to users from the resource pool, and released to resource pool when
   it's not needed.

   Virtual resources are isolated from physical equipments, and have the
   features:

   o  Have all features as physical resources, resource users can't
      distinguish the difference between them;

   o  Can be allocated and released on demand;

   o  Support heterogeneous physical equipments, and supply a
      consistency view of resources to users;

   o  Support resource mobility, virtual resource can move from one
      physical equipment to another seamlessly;

   There are several types of resources, such as computing resource,
   storage resource, database, bandwidth and network.  According to the
   type of resource, there are different methods to realize
   virtualization.  The variety function modules for virtualization are
   contained in Resources abstraction and virtualization layer.  The
   layer has the following responsibilities:

   o  Through the interface of physical equipment to manage physical
      resource, mapping the virtual resources to physical resource;

   o  Supply the interface to upper layer to manage and access virtual
      resources;

   o  Hide the details of physical equipments, mask the difference
      between physical equipments.

3.1.3.1.  Networking (Resources) Layer

   Networking (Resources) layer converts and communicates network (LAN/
   MAN/WAN) capabilities and capacities(such as Bandwidth, ports,
   Latency matrices, Jitter matrices, Availability, Restoration
   capabilities, etc) into a set of resource pools that can be
   understood and used by the above layers.  The resource pools include

   o  Virtual Switch

   o  Virtual Router

   o  Virtual Firewall

   o  Virtual Network Interface

   o  Virtual Network Link

   o  VPN

3.1.4.  Physical Resources Layer

   Physical Resources Layer include

   o  CPU

   o  Memory

   o  Hard Disk

   o  Network Interface Card

   o  Network Link

      *  Ports

      *  Bandwidth

3.2.  VERTICAL LAYERS

3.2.1.  Cloud Management Layer -> Cloud Management Plane

   Cloud Management Layer (CML) provides monitoring and administration
   of the cloud network platform to keep the whole cloud operating
   normally.

   Key features of the Virtual System Management Layer include:

   o  Automatically deploying the cloud system based on the
      configuration data and policy

   o  Real-time monitoring and alerting of cloud status, resource usage
      and performance of cloud

   o  Reporting and charting of historical events and performance
      metrics

   o  Flexible IT management and operational status displays

   o  Authenticating/Authorizing the published cloud service registry

   o  Auditing the cloud environment to check whether its running
      smoothly

   o  Controlling the SLA implemented in the cloud system

   o  Maintenance concerned with performing repairs, upgrades and new
      nodes join into the Cloud

   o  Providing Security mechanism for the Cloud

   Basically CML includes four Functions:

   o  Cloud Configuration Management

   o  Cloud Service Registry and Audit Management

   o  Cloud SLA Management

   o  Cloud Service Security Management

3.2.1.1.  Cloud Configuration Management

   Cloud Configuration Management (CCM) is responsible for establishing
   and maintaining the consistent performance of the Clouds system or
   product and its functional and physical attributes throughout its



Khasnabish, et al.      Expires December 30, 2012              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          Cloud Reference Framework              June 2012


   life-cycle.  It mainly focuses on configuring the cloud system and
   retrieving the configuration information automatically.  Requirements
   on Configuration Management are as follows:

   o  Provide efficient and reliable means to provision large amounts of
      configuration data.  Current versions of provision configuration
      data are CLI, SNMP and NETCONF.

   o  Provide secure means to provision configuration data.  The system
      must provide support for access control, authentication,
      integrity-checking, replay- protection and/or privacy security
      services.

   o  Provide means to send feedback information to the management
      system.  Feedback information include configuration data
      confirmation, network status and monitoring information, specific
      events, etc.

   o  Provide expiration time and effective time capabilities to
      configuration data.  It is required that some configuration data
      items be set to expire, and other items be set to never expire.

   o  Provide facilities to help in tracing back configuration changes

   o  Be flexible and extensible to accommodate future needs.
      Configuration management data models are not fixed for all time
      and are subject to evolution like any other management data model.

   o  Leverage knowledge of the existing SNMP management infrastructure,
      such as the knowledge of and experience with MIBs and SMI.

   o  Basically, the CM includes CM database, CM policy, system change
      management and version management.

   o  Related protocol: CLI, SNMP, NETCONF

3.2.1.2.  Cloud Service Registry/Repository

   Service Registry/Repository provides management and governance
   capabilities that enable the published cloud service to be
   authenticated in the cloud system and accessed by service client.  It
   facilitates storing, accessing and managing service information,
   called service metadata, so that the cloud service can be easily
   published, selected, invoked, enriched, governed and reused.

   Requirements on Service Registry/Repository are as follows:





Khasnabish, et al.      Expires December 30, 2012              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          Cloud Reference Framework              June 2012


   o  Authentication & Authorization.  Once a service is published by
      the service provider to the Cloud system, it should be
      authenticated to check the authority of the provider and the
      support capability of the Cloud.  If the check is passed, the
      service is authorized and put into the repository, and the
      services and related metadata are classified into groups.

   o  Publication & Discovery.  The authorized service is published in
      the Cloud system, and you can keep an accurate record of the
      deployed services in your repository platform.  The user can find
      the service from the repository platform using the service
      discovery engine.  Cloud Service Registry/Repository is capable of
      a powerful query mechanism allows you to search and find the
      services that best fit the requirements of a given process.

   o  Service Access Control.  The service repository enables dynamic
      and efficient access to services information by enabling selection
      of services based on service metadata.

   o  Optimize service usage.  Service manage capability enables
      management of service metadata, as well as service interactions,
      dependencies and redundancies.  You can classify services based on
      business objectives, manage policies for service usage and monitor
      how services are changed and versioned.  This capability helps you
      optimize the use of services in cloud system by exchanging service
      metadata with runtime monitoring tools and operational data
      stores.

   o  Impact analysis.  By maintaining relationships, Cloud Service
      Registry/Repository has extensive support for analyzing the impact
      of service introduction, deletion or alteration.

   o  Service life cycle.  By creating user-definable entities and
      customizing the service life cycle, you can configure Cloud
      Service Registry/Repository precisely according to your business
      needs.  You can easily implement best practices for service life-
      cycle management with the ability to promote services and life-
      cycle validations.

   o  Policy support.  You can publish policies that apply to services
      stored in Cloud Service Registry/Repository.  These policies help
      you institute best practices in your Cloud deployment.

   o  Governance profile.  To help you get started easily and quickly,
      Cloud Service Registry/Repository provides a welldefined service
      model that includes templates, associated life cycles, governance
      policies, a classification system, roles and perspectives.

3.2.1.3.  Cloud Audit Management

   Cloud Audit Management (CAM) is to provide an agent through which
   cloud providers and authorized consumers automate the Audit,
   Assertion, Assessment, and Assurance of the cloud infrastructure
   (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and application (SaaS) environments to
   reduce the risk.  A common interface and namespace can be used by the
   CAM to facilitate these audit functions.

   Requirements on CAM are as follows:

   o  A well-defined objective and scope tied to quality compliance and
      risk management processes

   o  Establish clear policies, procedures, and metrics.  Audit
      management should incorporate defined policies, procedures, and
      metrics as performance benchmarks.  These elements should be
      reviewed periodically for continuous improvement.

   o  Integrate essential quality management processes.  An effective
      audit management system should automate the entire audit process
      and include integration of the following processes:

      *  Corrective and preventive actions

      *  Change control

      *  Non-conformance tracking and management

      *  Regulatory document/content management

      *  Custom reporting, analysis and analytics

      *  Training

      *  Compliance intelligence dashboard

3.2.1.4.  Cloud SLA Management (CSM)

   SLA is a part of a service contract where the level of service is
   formally defined between Cloud service providers and Cloud customers.
   Within the terms of their contracts, the SLA will have a technical
   definition, typical terms as MTTF (Mean Time To Failures), MTTR (Mean
   Time To Repair), ABA (Abandonment Rate), ASA (Average Speed to
   Answer), TSF (Time Service Factor), FCR (First Call Resolution), TAT
   (Turn Around Time), Uptime Agreements, various data rates, etc.

   SM is to control the usage and receipt of resources from and by third



Khasnabish, et al.      Expires December 30, 2012              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft          Cloud Reference Framework              June 2012


   parties.  The strategy of CSM includes the negotiation of the
   contract and the monitoring of its realization in real-time.  Thus,
   CSM encompasses the SLA contract definition (basic schema within QoS
   parameters), the SLA negotiation, the SLA monitoring, and the SLA
   enforcement.

   SM also need define rate reductions and discounts that are applied
   when a service provider fails to meet the desired service parameters
   or does not fulfill an agreement.

   Requirements on CSM are as follows:

   o  SLA template specification. when service provider publishes a new
      service, an SLA template which describes the contract type that
      goes with the resource usage will be specified.  Such a template
      may be hard to define we propose to develop a skeleton of a
      template with the corresponding write-up procedure.

   o  Negotiation.  Service client and service providers have to agree
      on the terms of the SLA binding them and also with the
      consequences to violations.

   o  Resource Optimization.  When the SLA processes the service access
      request from the service client, it also has to keep in mind the
      optimization of the usage of resources, and the QoS guaranteed in
      the SLA.

   o  Monitoring.  Once the cloud system has started providing access to
      its resources, it should monitor the operating resources.  The
      monitored information is then used to prove the QoS agreed within
      the SLA being satisfied.

   o  Re-negotiation.  Some party of the contract may wish to change the
      resource usage policy while the system is running, in order to
      comply with a change in external conditions.  In order to keep the
      behaviour of the process continuous, the agreed SLA need adjust to
      assure the process vitality after migration and resource shortage.

   o  Evaluation.  Besides the running information is interested by the
      managers and users, other data like contract violations or global
      statistics are also needed in order to verify the SLA.  Evaluation
      is the process of analyzing the previously monitored information.
      An evaluation daemon may be proposed, based on the monitoring
      tools developed.

   o  Accounting.  The use of a resource generates an accounting sheet
      which describes the resources used and aligns them with the
      billing rules agreed in the SLA.  This is a base to draft the real



Khasnabish, et al.      Expires December 30, 2012              [Page 17]

      financial exchange, which can be in disfavour of the provider in
      case of failure to comply with the compromised QoS.  This subject
      is very sensible, and the development of tools for such themes
      should not be taken lightly.

   Related Language: WSLA, ITIL

3.2.1.5.  Cloud Service Security Management

   Cloud Service Security (CSS) provides a set of security services and
   mechanisms (e.g.  IP address filtering, firewall, message integrity &
   confidentiality, private key encryption, dynamic session key
   encryption, user authentication and Service certification) to protect
   Cloud Services and their operating environment from not authorised
   use, policy/operation violation and intrusion..

   Requirements on CSS are as follows

   o  Licensing.  It is likely that your service is made up of many
      different components, most of which have some type of licensing
      agreement associated with them.  You will need to review each of
      those agreements to determine if, or how, those licenses will be
      affected by deployment in a cloud.  If your service uses a
      component that is licensed by CPU and you deploy it in a cloud
      environment designed to launch new instances and request more
      resources as load increases, for example, you could easily exceed
      your CPU license limit.  You will need to understand how your
      licenses affect your ability to scale.

   o  Processing requirements and memory locks.  If dynamic scalability
      is your main reason for looking to the cloud, then your
      application should be designed to take advantage of a parallel
      architecture.  If the application is designed with multi-threaded
      code that allows processing to be split into small chunks, it's
      well-suited for use within the cloud.  An application that is
      designed around single monolithic thread processing, on the other
      hand, will find it difficult to take advantage of the cloud's
      distributed nature.

   o  Communication protocol.  The cloud is based on the Internet
      Protocol (IP), so for an service to be considered, it must use IP
      as its communication mechanism.  While there are many protocols
      that can be run over IP, the IP layer can provide security
      mechanism to protect the security of the transmitted data.

   o  Data security.  The service needs to provide security at the data
      storage, processing and transmission stages.  Data at rest must be
      protected by the service, that is the service must provide a

Internet-Draft          Cloud Reference Framework              June 2012


      mechanism to protect the data stored in the cloud.  Data in
      transit needs to be protected either at the service or the
      transmission level.  Most services choose the transmission level
      for protection and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer
      Security (TLS) protocols are often used.  Server to server
      communications need to ensure the security from one cloud instance
      to another cloud instance.

4.  Inter-Cloud Framework

   The inter-cloud interoperability and integration is motivated by a
   number of uses to provide multi-provider cloud services and
   infrastructures, multi-platform cloud services integration and
   traditional/legacy infrastructure services migration to clouds, and
   IT infrastructure services recovery or migration/move to a new
   location, platform, or service model.

   A Cloud Service Provider (CSP) can offer services using one or more
   date centers (DCs).  These DCs can provide virtualized compute,
   storage, and networking resources on on-demand basis to the Cloud
   Service Consumers (CSC).  Therefore, the DC infrastructure does not
   necessarily need to be a static entity as in a traditional DC.  The
   infrastructure resources can span multiple CSPs and the entity that
   is offered to the consumer can be referred to as the Infrastructure
   as a Service (IaaS).

   With the IaaS, a CSC can acquire and release resources on on-demand
   basis.

   We therefore define an Inter-Cloud as a interconnction of clouds
   where two or more cloud service providers (any combination of
   Service-Provider-owned, private, public, etc.) can collaborate.  The
   objective of the collaboration is to dynamically distribute the
   workloads based on mutually agreed upon service level agreement
   (SLA).

4.1.  Inter-Cloud Requirements

   o  ICF should support communication between cloud applications and
      services belonging to different service layers (vertical
      integration), between cloud domains and heterogeneous platforms
      (horizontal integration).




Khasnabish, et al.      Expires December 30, 2012              [Page 20]

Internet-Draft          Cloud Reference Framework              June 2012


   o  ICA should provide a possibility that applications could control
      infrastructure and related supporting services at different
      service layers to achieve run-time optimization and required
      Quality of Service (QoS) (typically related to Intercloud control
      and management functions).

   o  ICA should support cloud services/infrastructures provisioning on-
      demand and their lifecycle management, including composition,
      deployment, operation, and monitoring, involving resources and
      services from multiple providers (this is typically related to
      service management and operations support functions).

   o  Provide a framework for heterogeneous inter-cloud federation

   o  Facilitate interoperable and measurable intra-provider
      infrastructures

   o  Explicit/Guaranteed intra- and inter-Cloud network infrastructure
      provisioning (as NaaS service model)

   o  Support existing Cloud Provider operational and business models
      and provide a basis for new forms of infrastructure services
      provisioning and operation

   More specific Inter-cloud funtional requirements may be articulated
   as follows:

   o  Provide a mechanism for resource search and discovery, to
      determine which serving cloud might have certain resources
      available (including a match making mechanism).

   o  Provide a mechanism to authenticate participating entities
      belonging to different cloud domains.

   o  Provide a mechanism for requesting, controlling, and releasing
      resources between two clouds.

   o  Provide a secure transport channel between the interconnecting
      entities.

   o  Provide end-to-end isolation to support multitenancy.

   o  Provide a mechanism for monitoring, assuring, and troubleshooting
      across the interconnection.

   o  Provide a mechanism for defining the monitoring metrics such as

      interconnection.

   Following the above requirements, we define the following
   complimentary components of the proposed Intercloud Architecture:

   (1) Intercloud Control and Management Plane (ICCMP) for Intercloud
   applications/infrastructure control and management, including inter-
   applications signaling, synchronization and session management,
   configuration, monitoring, run time infrastructure optimization
   including VM migration, resources scaling, and jobs/objects routing;

   (2) Intercloud Federation Framework (ICFF) to allow independent
   clouds and related infrastructure components federation of
   independently managed cloud based infrastructure components belonging
   to different cloud providers and/or administrative domains; this
   should support federation at the level of services, business
   applications, semantics, and namespaces, assuming necessary gateway
   or federation services;

   (3) Intercloud Operation Framework (ICOF) which includes
   functionalities to support multi-provider infrastructure operation
   including business workflow, SLA management, accounting.  ICOF
   defines the basic roles, actors and their relations in sense of
   resources operation, management and ownership.  ICOF requires support
   from and interacts with both ICCMP and ICFF.

   The following sections provides in details descriptions of the
   proposed ICF components definition and suggestions about required
   interfaces and supporting protocols.

4.2.  Intercloud Control and Management Plane (ICCMP)

   The ICCMP defines functionality and functional components for
   Intercloud applications/infrastructure control and management,
   including inter-applications signaling, synchronization and session
   management, configuration, monitoring, runtime infrastructure
   optimization.  ICCMP should support also more complex operations such
   as VM migration, resources scaling, and jobs/objects/data routing

   The ICCMP definition/development attempts to leverage the general
   Internet technologies such as provided by CDN [CNDI, I-D], XMPP
   [XMPP, RFC] and the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) [GMPLS, RFC].

   Main functional components include

   o  Cloud Resource Manager

   o  Network Infrastructure Manager

   Possible ICCMP Interfaces include

   o  Signaling

   o  Control

   o  Monitoring

   o  Management

   o  Location

   o  Message routing

4.3.  Intercloud Federation Framework (ICFF)

   ICFF is defined to allow independent clouds and related
   infrastructure components federation of independently managed cloud
   based infrastructure components belonging to different cloud
   providers and/or administrative domains; this should support
   federation at the level of services, business applications,
   semantics, and namespaces, assuming necessary gateway or federation
   services, and also supporting federated security infrastructure
   including federated identity and trust management;

   The ICFF is built upon and extends current cloud federation concept
   [CloudFed] and leverage existing platforms for federated network
   access and federated identity management widely used for multi-domain
   and multi-provider infrastructure integration [22, 23].

   One of the main components of the federated Intercloud architecture
   is the Intercloud gateway that provides translation and forwarding of
   the requests, protocols, data formats between cloud domains that may
   use different semantics, protocols, trust relations.

   The main goal of ICFF is to allow heterogeneous clouds integration at
   service and business level.

   Main functional components include

   o  Trust and service broker

   o  Identity provider

   o  Service Registry

   o  Service discovery

   o  Trust manager/router

   o  Attribute/namespace resolver

   o  Intercloud gateway and/or attribute/namespace translator

   Possible ICFF Interfaces

   o  Naming, Addressing and Translation (if/as needed)

   o  Publishing

   o  Discovery

   o  Attributes management

   o  Trust/key management

4.4.  Intercloud Operation Framework (ICOF)

   ICOF includes functionalities to support multi-provider
   infrastructure operation including business workflow, SLA management,
   accounting, and operational security.  ICOF defines the basic roles,
   actors and their relations in sense of resources operation,
   management and ownership.  ICOF requires support from and interacts
   with both ICCMP and ICFF.

   ICOF defines the main roles and actors based on the RORA model:
   Resource, Ownership, Role, Action.  This should provide a basis for
   business processes definition, SLA management and access control
   policy definition and also Broker and Federation operation.

   The ICOF definition will include analysis and adoption of the
   TeleManagement Forum (TMF) documents related to eTOM and Operational
   Support Systems [TMF], Service Delivery Framework (SDF) [TMF SDF],
   and SLA Management [TMF SLAM].

   Main functional components include

   o  Service Broker

   o  Service Registry

   o  Cloud Service Provider, Cloud Operator, Cloud (physical) Resource
      provider, Cloud Carrier

5.2.  Telecom Network Virtualization

   Telecom Network virtualization is the technology that enables the
   creation of logically isolated network partitions over shared
   physical network infrastructures so that multiple virtual telecom
   networks can simultaneously coexist over the shared infrastructures.

   The objectives of telecom network virtualization is to

   o  scale telecom services on demand

   o  improve reliability and availability

   o  efficiently use infrastructure

   In order to facilitate the deployment of telecom network
   virtualization, Manager Node provides control procedures such as
   creating Functional (Service) Entity operating on Execution Node,
   monitoring the status of Functional (Service) Entity and Execution
   Node, measuring the performance, retrieving deployment data from
   Infromation Server, and so on.

   Execution Node is a physical or virtual machines on which target
   telecomm functions (software) are running.  For example, in IMS, CSCF
   and HSS are candidates of functions.

   Information Server (optional) is used for discovery and assignment of
   Execution Node for a session (e.g., P-CSCF at a UE's registration).

      inside the server blades.  The individual VMs appear to a VSw as
      IP hosts connected via logical interfaces.  The VSw may evolve to

      support IP routing functionality.

   o  ToR or Top of Rack - software-based or hardware-based Ethernet
      switch aggregating all Ethernet links from the server blades in a
      rack representing the entry point in the physical DC network for
      the hosts.  ToRs may also perform routing functionality.

   o  Core SW (switch) - high capacity core node aggregating multiple
      ToRs.  This is usually a cost effective Ethernet switch.  Core
      switches can also support routing capabilities.

   o  DC GW - gateway to the outside world providing DC Interconnect and
      connectivity to Internet and VPN customers.  In the current DC
      network model, this may be a Router with Virtual Routing
      capabilities and/or an IPVPN/L2VPN PE.

5.4.  Security Framework for VDCS

   Virtualized Data Center Services (VDCS) Security Framework is a
   reference framework to build secure and interoperable services on top
   of a virtualized infrastructure.  A security framework and the
   associated requirements for Protocols, Profiles, Network Interfaces,
   Operations and Management, and Application Interfaces(APIs) need to
   be proposed in an environment where virtualized resources are shared
   among a variety of public and private subscribers/clients seamlessly.

   The various applications and interworking protocols developed by the
   IETF MAY need to be extended or profiled to support the security
   requirements of virtualized services and infrastructure environment.

   o  Applications & Services: The most widely used protocol that is in
      use today for application & services development areas like HTTP
      have been considered for the applications in the virtualized
      environment.  The protocol may have to be profiled or extended
      with significant changes to be ready to handle the security
      requirements in a virtualized environment.

   o  Infrastructure Operations & Management: The various security
      parameters related to operations and management of virtualized
      network resources in multiple administrative domains may need to
      be defined.  The results of monitoring may need to be exchanged
      periodically to support the private and public virtualized domains
      and infrastructure in order to maintain the expected end-to-end
      security.

   The above protocol extension and operations & management requirements
   can be implemented in current cloud reference framework (CRF) based
   on the security functionality provided by cloud management layer,
