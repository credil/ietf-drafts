    1. Introduction 

       This document provides a framework for Data Center Network 
       Virtualization over L3 tunnels. This framework is intended to aid in 
       standardizing protocols and mechanisms to support large scale 
       network virtualization for data centers.  

       Several IETF drafts relate to the use of overlay networks for data 
       centers. [NVOPS] defines the rationale for using overlay networks in 
       order to build large multi-tenant data center networks. Compute, 
       storage and network virtualization are often used in these large 
       data centers to support a large number of communication domains and 
       end systems. [OVCPREQ] describes the requirements for a control 
       plane protocol required by overlay border nodes to exchange overlay 
       mappings. 

       This document provides reference models and functional components of 
       data center overlay networks as well as a discussion of technical 
       issues that have to be addressed in the design of standards and 
       mechanisms for large-scale data centers.

    1.1. Conventions used in this document  

       The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
       document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].  

       In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   
       only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be    
       interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance. 

    1.2. General terminology  

       This document uses the following terminology: 

       NVE: Network Virtualization Edge. It is a network entity that sits 
       on the edge of the NVO3 network. It implements network 
       virtualization functions that allow for L2 and/or L3 tenant 
       separation and for hiding tenant addressing information (MAC and IP 
       addresses). An NVE could be implemented as part of a virtual switch 
       within a hypervisor, a physical switch or router, or a network 
       service appliance. 

       VN: Virtual Network. This is a virtual L2 or L3 domain that belongs 
       to a tenant. 

       VNI: Virtual Network Instance. This is one instance of a virtual 
       overlay network. It refers to the state maintained for a given VN on 
       a given NVE. Two Virtual Networks are isolated from one another and 
       may use overlapping addresses. 

       Virtual Network Context or VN Context: Field that is part of the 
       overlay encapsulation header which allows the encapsulated frame to 
       be delivered to the appropriate virtual network endpoint by the 
       egress NVE. The egress NVE uses this field to determine the 
       appropriate virtual network context in which to process the packet. 
       This field MAY be an explicit, unique (to the administrative domain) 
       virtual network identifier (VNID) or MAY express the necessary 
       context information in other ways (e.g., a locally significant 
       identifier). 

       VNID:  Virtual Network Identifier. In the case where the VN context 
       identifier has global significance, this is the ID value that is 
       carried in each data packet in the overlay encapsulation that 
       identifies the Virtual Network the packet belongs to.

    Internet-Draft  Framework for DC Network Virtualization  February 2013 
     

       Underlay or Underlying Network: This is the network that provides 
       the connectivity between NVEs. The Underlying Network can be 
       completely unaware of the overlay packets. Addresses within the 
       Underlying Network are also referred to as "outer addresses" because 
       they exist in the outer encapsulation. The Underlying Network can 
       use a completely different protocol (and address family) from that 
       of the overlay. 

       Data Center (DC): A physical complex housing physical servers, 
       network switches and routers, network service sppliances and 
       networked storage. The purpose of a Data Center is to provide 
       application, compute and/or storage services. One such service is 
       virtualized infrastructure data center services, also known as 
       Infrastructure as a Service. 

       Virtual Data Center or Virtual DC: A container for virtualized 
       compute, storage and network services. Managed by a single tenant, a 
       Virtual DC can contain multiple VNs and multiple Tenant Systems that 
       are connected to one or more of these VNs. 

       VM: Virtual Machine. Several Virtual Machines can share the 
       resources of a single physical computer server using the services of 
       a Hypervisor (see below definition). 

       Hypervisor: Server virtualization software running on a physical 
       compute server that hosts Virtual Machines. The hypervisor provides 
       shared compute/memory/storage and network connectivity to the VMs 
       that it hosts. Hypervisors often embed a Virtual Switch (see below). 

       Virtual Switch: A function within a Hypervisor (typically 
       implemented in software) that provides similar services to a 
       physical Ethernet switch.  It switches Ethernet frames between VMs 
       virtual NICs within the same physical server, or between a VM and a 
       physical NIC card connecting the server to a physical Ethernet 
       switch or router. It also enforces network isolation between VMs 
       that should not communicate with each other. 

       Tenant: In a DC, a tenant refers to a customer that could be an 
       organization within an enterprise, or an enterprise with a set of DC 
       compute, storage and network resources associated with it. 

       Tenant System: A physical or virtual system that can play the role 
       of a host, or a forwarding element such as a router, switch, 
       firewall, etc. It belongs to a single tenant and connects to one or 
       more VNs of that tenant.

       End device: A physical system to which networking service is 
       provided. Examples include hosts (e.g. server or server blade), 
       storage systems (e.g., file servers, iSCSI storage systems), and 
       network devices (e.g., firewall, load-balancer, IPSec gateway). An 
       end device may include internal networking functionality that 
       interconnects the device's components (e.g. virtual switches that 
       interconnect VMs running on the same server). NVE functionality may 
       be implemented as part of that internal networking. 

       ELAN: MEF ELAN, multipoint to multipoint Ethernet service  

       EVPN: Ethernet VPN as defined in [EVPN]

    Internet-Draft  Framework for DC Network Virtualization  February 2013 
     

       An example of multi-tier DC network architecture is presented in 
       this figure. It provides a view of physical components inside a DC.  

       A cloud network is composed of intra-Data Center (DC) networks and 
       network services, and inter-DC network and network connectivity 
       services. Depending upon the scale, DC distribution, operations 
       model, Capex and Opex aspects, DC networking elements can act as 
       strict L2 switches and/or provide IP routing capabilities, including 
       service virtualization.  

       In some DC architectures, it is possible that some tier layers 
       provide L2 and/or L3 services, are collapsed, and that Internet 
       connectivity, inter-DC connectivity and VPN support are handled by a 
       smaller number of nodes. Nevertheless, one can assume that the 
       functional blocks fit in the architecture above.  

       The following components can be present in a DC: 

          o Top of Rack (ToR): Hardware-based Ethernet switch aggregating 
            all Ethernet links from the End Devices in a rack representing 
            the entry point in the physical DC network for the hosts. ToRs 
            may also provide routing functionality, virtual IP network 
            connectivity, or Layer2 tunneling over IP for instance. ToRs 
            are usually multi-homed to switches in the Intra-DC network. 
            Other deployment scenarios may use an intermediate Blade Switch 
            before the ToR or an EoR (End of Row) switch to provide similar 
            function as a ToR.  

          o Intra-DC Network: High capacity network composed of core 
            switches aggregating multiple ToRs. Core switches are usually 
            Ethernet switches but can also support routing capabilities. 

          o DC GW: Gateway to the outside world providing DC Interconnect 
            and connectivity to Internet and VPN customers. In the current 
            DC network model, this may be simply a Router connected to the 
            Internet and/or an IPVPN/L2VPN PE. Some network implementations 
            may dedicate DC GWs for different connectivity types (e.g., a 
            DC GW for Internet, and another for VPN). 

       Note that End Devices may be single or multi-homed to ToRs.  

    1.4. Tenant networking view 

       The DC network architecture is used to provide L2 and/or L3 service 
       connectivity to each tenant. An example is depicted in Figure 2:

       In this example, one or more L3 contexts and one or more LANs (e.g., 
       one per application type) are assigned for DC tenant1.  

       For a multi-tenant DC, a virtualized version of this type of service 
       connectivity needs to be provided for each tenant by the Network 
       Virtualization solution.

    2.1. Generic Reference Model 

       The following diagram shows a DC reference model for network 
       virtualization using L3 (IP/MPLS) overlays where NVEs provide a 
       logical interconnect between Tenant Systems that belong to a 
       specific tenant network.

                           over a Layer3 infrastructure 

       A Tenant System can be attached to a Network Virtualization Edge 
       (NVE) node in several ways: 

         - locally, by being co-located in the same device 

         - remotely, via a point-to-point connection or a switched network 
         (e.g., Ethernet) 

       When an NVE is local, the state of Tenant Systems can be provided 
       without protocol assistance. For instance, the operational status of 
     
     
    Lasserre, et al.       Expires August 4, 2013                 [Page 9]

       a VM can be communicated via a local API. When an NVE is remote, the 
       state of Tenant Systems needs to be exchanged via a data or control 
       plane protocol, or via a management entity. 

       The functional components in Figure 3 do not necessarily map 
       directly with the physical components described in Figure 1. 

       For example, an End Device can be a server blade with VMs and 
       virtual switch, i.e. the VM is the Tenant System and the NVE 
       functions may be performed by the virtual switch and/or the 
       hypervisor. In this case, the Tenant System and NVE function are co-
       located. 

       Another example is the case where an End Device can be a traditional 
       physical server (no VMs, no virtual switch), i.e. the server is the 
       Tenant System and the NVE function may be performed by the ToR. 
       Other End Devices in this category are physical network appliances 
       or storage systems. 

       The NVE implements network virtualization functions that allow for 
       L2 and/or L3 tenant separation and for hiding tenant addressing 
       information (MAC and IP addresses), tenant-related control plane 
       activity and service contexts from the underlay nodes. 

       Underlay nodes utilize L3 techniques to interconnect NVE nodes in 
       support of the overlay network. These devices perform forwarding 
       based on outer L3 tunnel header, and generally do not maintain per 
       tenant-service state albeit some applications (e.g., multicast) may 
       require control plane or forwarding plane information that pertain 
       to a tenant, group of tenants, tenant service or a set of services 
       that belong to one or more tenants. When such tenant or tenant-
       service related information is maintained in the underlay, overlay 
       virtualization provides knobs to control the magnitude of that 
       information. 

    2.2. NVE Reference Model 

       One or more VNIs can be instantiated on an NVE. Tenant Systems 
       interface with a corresponding VNI via a Virtual Access Point (VAP). 
       An overlay module that provides tunneling overlay functions (e.g., 
       encapsulation and decapsulation of tenant traffic from/to the tenant 
       forwarding instance, tenant identification and mapping, etc), as 
       described in figure 4:

       Note that some NVE functions (e.g., data plane and control plane 
       functions) may reside in one device or may be implemented separately 
       in different devices. For example, the NVE functionality could 
       reside solely on the End Devices, or be distributed between the End 
       Devices and the ToRs. In the latter case we say that the End Device 
       NVE component acts as the NVE Spoke, and ToRs act as NVE hubs. 
       Tenant Systems will interface with VNIs maintained on the NVE 
       spokes, and VNIs maintained on the NVE spokes will interface with 
       VNIs maintained on the NVE hubs. 

    2.3. NVE Service Types 

       NVE components may be used to provide different types of virtualized 
       network services. This section defines the service types and 
       associated attributes. Note that an NVE may be capable of providing 
       both L2 and L3 services.

    2.3.1. L2 NVE providing Ethernet LAN-like service 

       L2 NVE implements Ethernet LAN emulation (ELAN), an Ethernet based 
       multipoint service where the Tenant Systems appear to be 
       interconnected by a LAN environment over a set of L3 tunnels. It 
       provides per tenant virtual switching instance with MAC addressing 
       isolation and L3 (IP/MPLS) tunnel encapsulation across the underlay. 

    2.3.2. L3 NVE providing IP/VRF-like service 

       Virtualized IP routing and forwarding is similar from a service 
       definition perspective with IETF IP VPN (e.g., BGP/MPLS IPVPN 
       [RFC4364] and IPsec VPNs). It provides per tenant routing instance 
       with addressing isolation and L3 (IP/MPLS) tunnel encapsulation 
       across the underlay. 

    3. Functional components 

       This section decomposes the Network Virtualization architecture into 
       functional components described in Figure 4 to make it easier to 
       discuss solution options for these components. 

    3.1. Service Virtualization Components 

    3.1.1. Virtual Access Points (VAPs) 

       Tenant Systems are connected to the VNI Instance through Virtual 
       Access Points (VAPs).  

       The VAPs can be physical ports or virtual ports identified through 
       logical interface identifiers (e.g., VLAN ID, internal vSwitch 
       Interface ID coonected to a VM).  

    3.1.2. Virtual Network Instance (VNI) 

       The VNI represents a set of configuration attributes defining access 
       and tunnel policies and (L2 and/or L3) forwarding functions.  

       Per tenant FIB tables and control plane protocol instances are used 
       to maintain separate private contexts between tenants. Hence tenants 
       are free to use their own addressing schemes without concerns about 
       address overlapping with other tenants.

    3.1.3. Overlay Modules and VN Context 

       Mechanisms for identifying each tenant service are required to allow 
       the simultaneous overlay of multiple tenant services over the same 
       underlay L3 network topology. In the data plane, each NVE, upon 
       sending a tenant packet, must be able to encode the VN Context for 
       the destination NVE in addition to the L3 tunnel information (e.g., 
       source IP address identifying the source NVE and the destination IP 
       address identifying the destination NVE, or MPLS label). This allows 
       the destination NVE to identify the tenant service instance and 
       therefore appropriately process and forward the tenant packet.  

       The Overlay module provides tunneling overlay functions: tunnel 
       initiation/termination, encapsulation/decapsulation of frames from 
       VAPs/L3 Backbone and may provide for transit forwarding of IP 
       traffic (e.g., transparent tunnel forwarding).  

       In a multi-tenant context, the tunnel aggregates frames from/to 
       different VNIs. Tenant identification and traffic demultiplexing are 
       based on the VN Context identifier (e.g., VNID).  

       The following approaches can been considered: 

          o One VN Context per Tenant: A globally unique (on a per-DC 
            administrative domain) VNID is used to identify the related 
            Tenant instances. An example of this approach is the use of 
            IEEE VLAN or ISID tags to provide virtual L2 domains. 

          o One VN Context per VNI: A per-tenant local value is 
            automatically generated by the egress NVE and usually 
            distributed by a control plane protocol to all the related 
            NVEs. An example of this approach is the use of per VRF MPLS 
            labels in IP VPN [RFC4364]. 

          o One VN Context per VAP: A per-VAP local value is assigned and 
            usually distributed by a control plane protocol. An example of 
            this approach is the use of per CE-PE MPLS labels in IP VPN 
            [RFC4364].  

       Note that when using one VN Context per VNI or per VAP, an 
       additional global identifier may be used by the control plane to 
       identify the Tenant context.

    Internet-Draft  Framework for DC Network Virtualization  February 2013 
     

    3.1.4. Tunnel Overlays and Encapsulation options 

       Once the VN context identifier is added to the frame, a L3 Tunnel 
       encapsulation is used to transport the frame to the destination NVE. 
       The backbone devices do not usually keep any per service state, 
       simply forwarding the frames based on the outer tunnel header. 

       Different IP tunneling options (e.g., GRE, L2TP, IPSec) and MPLS 
       tunneling options (e.g., BGP VPN, VPLS) can be used. 

    3.1.5. Control Plane Components 

       Control plane components may be used to provide the following 
       capabilities: 

          . Auto-provisioning/Service discovery 

          . Address advertisement and tunnel mapping 

          . Tunnel management 

       A control plane component can be an on-net control protocol 
       implemented on the NVE or a management control entity. 

    3.1.5.1. Distributed vs Centralized Control Plane 

       A control/management plane entity can be centralized or distributed. 
       Both approaches have been used extensively in the past. The routing 
       model of the Internet is a good example of a distributed approach. 
       Transport networks have usually used a centralized approach to 
       manage transport paths. 

       It is also possible to combine the two approaches i.e. using a 
       hybrid model. A global view of network state can have many benefits 
       but it does not preclude the use of distributed protocols within the 
       network. Centralized controllers provide a facility to maintain 
       global state, and distribute that state to the network which in 
       combination with distributed protocols can aid in achieving greater 
       network efficiencies, and improve reliability and robustness. Domain 
       and/or deployment specific constraints define the balance between 
       centralized and distributed approaches. 

       On one hand, a control plane module can reside in every NVE. This is 
       how routing control plane modules are implemented in routers. At the 
       same time, an external controller can manage a group of NVEs via an 


     
     
    Lasserre, et al.       Expires August 4, 2013                [Page 14] 
        

















    Internet-Draft  Framework for DC Network Virtualization  February 2013 
     

       agent in each NVE. This is how an SDN controller could communicate 
       with the nodes it controls, via OpenFlow [OF] for instance.  

       In the case where a logically centralized control plane is 
       preferred, the controller will need to be distributed to more than 
       one node for redundancy and scalability in order to manage a large 
       number of NVEs. Hence, inter-controller communication is necessary 
       to synchronize state among controllers. It should be noted that 
       controllers may be organized in clusters. The information exchanged 
       between controllers of the same cluster could be different from the 
       information exchanged across clusters. 

    3.1.5.2. Auto-provisioning/Service discovery 

       NVEs must be able to identify the appropriate VNI for each Tenant 
       System. This is based on state information that is often provided by 
       external entities. For example, in an environment where a VM is a 
       Tenant System, this information is provided by compute management 
       systems, since these are the only entities that have visibility of 
       which VM belongs to which tenant.  

       A mechanism for communicating this information between Tenant 
       Systems and the corresponding NVE is required. As a result the VAPs 
       are created and mapped to the appropriate VNI. Depending upon the 
       implementation, this control interface can be implemented using an 
       auto-discovery protocol between Tenant Systems and their local NVE 
       or through management entities. In either case, appropriate security 
       and authentication mechanisms to verify that Tenant System 
       information is not spoofed or altered are required. This is one 
       critical aspect for providing integrity and tenant isolation in the 
       system. 

       A control plane protocol can also be used to advertize supported VNs 
       to other NVEs. Alternatively, management control entities can also 
       be used to perform these functions. 

    3.1.5.3. Address advertisement and tunnel mapping 

       As traffic reaches an ingress NVE, a lookup is performed to 
       determine which tunnel the packet needs to be sent to. It is then 
       encapsulated with a tunnel header containing the destination 
       information (destination IP address or MPLS label) of the egress 
       overlay node. Intermediate nodes (between the ingress and egress 
       NVEs) switch or route traffic based upon the outer destination 
       information.

       One key step in this process consists of mapping a final destination 
       information to the proper tunnel. NVEs are responsible for 
       maintaining such mappings in their forwarding tables. Several ways 
       of populating these tables are possible: control plane driven, 
       management plane driven, or data plane driven.  

       When a control plane protocol is used to distribute address 
       advertisement and tunneling information, the auto-
       provisioning/Service discovery could be accomplished by the same 
       protocol. In this scenario, the auto-provisioning/Service discovery 
       could be combined with (be inferred from) the address advertisement 
       and associated tunnel mapping. Furthermore, a control plane protocol 
       that carries both MAC and IP addresses eliminates the need for ARP, 
       and hence addresses one of the issues with explosive ARP handling. 

    3.1.5.4. Overlay Tunneling 

       For overlay tunneling, and dependent upon the tunneling technology 
       used for encapsulating the tenant system packets, it may be 
       sufficient to have one or more local NVE addresses assigned and used 
       in the source and destination fields of a tunneling encapsulating 
       header. Other information that is part of the 
       tunneling encapsulation header may also need to be configured. In 
       certain cases, local NVE configuration may be sufficient while in 
       other cases, some tunneling related information may need to 
       be shared among NVEs. The information that needs to be shared will 
       be technology dependent. This includes the discovery and 
       announcement of the tunneling technology used. In certain cases, 
       such as when using IP multicast in the underlay, tunnels may need to 
       be established, interconnecting NVEs. When tunneling information 
       needs to be exchanged or shared among NVEs, a control plane protocol 
       may be required. For instance, it may be necessary to provide 
       active/standby status information between NVEs, up/down status 
       information, pruning/grafting information for multicast tunnels, 
       etc. 

       In addition, a control plane may be required to setup the tunnel 
       path for some tunneling technologies. This applies to both unicast 
       and multicast tunneling. 

    3.2. Multi-homing 

       Multi-homing techniques can be used to increase the reliability of 
       an nvo3 network. It is also important to ensure that physical 
       diversity in an nvo3 network is taken into account to avoid single 
       points of failure. 

     
     
    Lasserre, et al.       Expires August 4, 2013                [Page 16] 
        

















    Internet-Draft  Framework for DC Network Virtualization  February 2013 
     

       Multi-homing can be enabled in various nodes, from tenant systems 
       into TORs, TORs into core switches/routers, and core nodes into DC 
       GWs. 

       The nvo3 underlay nodes (i.e. from NVEs to DC GWs) rely on IP 
       routing as the means to re-route traffic upon failures and/or ECMP 
       techniques or on MPLS re-rerouting capabilities. 

       When a tenant system is co-located with the NVE on the same end-
       system, the tenant system is single homed to the NVE via a vport 
       that is virtual NIC (vNIC). When the end system and the NVEs are 
       separated, the end system is connected to the NVE via a logical 
       Layer2 (L2) construct such as a VLAN. In this latter case, an end 
       device or vSwitch on that device could be multi-homed to various 
       NVEs. An NVE may provide an L2 service to the end system or a l3 
       service. An NVE may be multi-homed to a next layer in the DC at 
       Layer2 (L2) or Layer3 (L3). When an NVE provides an L2 service and 
       is not co-located with the end system, techniques such as Ethernet 
       Link Aggregation Group (LAG) or Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) can be 
       used to switch traffic between an end system and connected 
       NVEs without creating loops. Similarly, when the NVE provides L3 
       service, similar dual-homing techniques can be used. When the NVE 
       provides a L3 service to the end system, it is possible that no 
       dynamic routing protocol is enabled between the end system and the 
       NVE. The end system can be multi-homed to multiple physically-
       separated L3 NVEs over multiple interfaces. When one of the 
       links connected to an NVE fails, the other interfaces can be used to 
       reach the end system.  

       External connectivity out of an nvo3 domain can be handled by two or 
       more nvo3 gateways. Each gateway is connected to a different domain 
       (e.g. ISP), providing access to external networks such as VPNs or 
       the Internet. A gateway may be connected to two nodes. When a 
       connection to an upstream node is lost, the alternative connection 
       is used and the failed route withdrawn. 

    3.3. VM Mobility 

       In DC environments utilizing VM technologies, an important feature 
       is that VMs can move from one server to another server in the same 
       or different L2 physical domains (within or across DCs) in a 
       seamless manner. 

       A VM can be moved from one server to another in stopped or suspended 
       state ("cold" VM mobility) or in running/active state ("hot" VM 
       mobility). With "hot" mobility, VM L2 and L3 addresses need to be 

     
     
    Lasserre, et al.       Expires August 4, 2013                [Page 17] 
        

















    Internet-Draft  Framework for DC Network Virtualization  February 2013 
     

       preserved. With "cold" mobility, it may be desired to preserve VM L3 
       addresses. 

       Solutions to maintain connectivity while a VM is moved are necessary 
       in the case of "hot" mobility. This implies that transport 
       connections among VMs are preserved and that ARP caches are updated 
       accordingly. 

       Upon VM mobility, NVE policies that define connectivity among VMs 
       must be maintained. 

       Optimal routing during VM mobility is also an important aspect to 
       address. It is expected that the VM's default gateway be as close as 
       possible to the server hosting the VM and triangular routing be 
       avoided. 

    3.4. Service Overlay Topologies 

       A number of service topologies may be used to optimize the service 
       connectivity and to address NVE performance limitations.  

       The topology described in Figure 3 suggests the use of a tunnel mesh 
       between the NVEs where each tenant instance is one hop away from a 
       service processing perspective. Partial mesh topologies and an NVE 
       hierarchy may be used where certain NVEs may act as service transit 
       points. 

    4. Key aspects of overlay networks 

       The intent of this section is to highlight specific issues that 
       proposed overlay solutions need to address. 

    4.1. Pros & Cons 

       An overlay network is a layer of virtual network topology on top of 
       the physical network.  

       Overlay networks offer the following key advantages: 

          o Unicast tunneling state management and association with tenant 
            systems reachability are handled at the edge of the network. 
            Intermediate transport nodes are unaware of such state. Note 
            that this is not the case when multicast is enabled in the core 
            network.

    Internet-Draft  Framework for DC Network Virtualization  February 2013 
     

          o Tunneling is used to aggregate traffic and hide tenant 
            addresses from the underkay network, and hence offer the 
            advantage of minimizing the amount of forwarding state required 
            within the underlay network 

          o Decoupling of the overlay addresses (MAC and IP) used by VMs 
            from the underlay network. This offers a clear separation 
            between addresses used within the overlay and the underlay 
            networks and it enables the use of overlapping addresses spaces 
            by Tenant Systems 

          o Support of a large number of virtual network identifiers 

       Overlay networks also create several challenges: 

          o Overlay networks have no controls of underlay networks and lack 
            critical network information 

               o Overlays typically probe the network to measure link or 
                 path properties, such as available bandwidth or packet 
                 loss rate. It is difficult to accurately evaluate network 
                 properties. It might be preferable for the underlay 
                 network to expose usage and performance information. 
     
          o Miscommunication or lack of coordination between overlay and 
            underlay networks can lead to an inefficient usage of network 
            resources.  

          o When multiple overlays co-exist on top of a common underlay 
            network, the lack of coordination between overlays can lead to 
            performance issues. 

          o Overlaid traffic may not traverse firewalls and NAT devices. 

          o Multicast service scalability. Multicast support may be 
            required in the underlay network to address for each tenant 
            flood containment or efficient multicast handling. The underlay 
            may be also be required to maintain multicast state on a per- 
            tenant basis, or even on a per-individual multicast flow of a 
            given tenant. 

          o Hash-based load balancing may not be optimal as the hash 
            algorithm may not work well due to the limited number of 
            combinations of tunnel source and destination addresses. Other 
            NVO3 mechanisms may use additional entropy information than 
            source and destination addresses.

    Internet-Draft  Framework for DC Network Virtualization  February 2013 
     

    4.2. Overlay issues to consider 

    4.2.1. Data plane vs Control plane driven 

       In the case of an L2NVE, it is possible to dynamically learn MAC 
       addresses against VAPs. It is also possible that such addresses be 
       known and controlled via management or a control protocol for both 
       L2NVEs and L3NVEs.  

       Dynamic data plane learning implies that flooding of unknown 
       destinations be supported and hence implies that broadcast and/or 
       multicast be supported or that ingress replication be used as 
       described in section 4.2.3. Multicasting in the underlay network for 
       dynamic learning may lead to significant scalability limitations. 
       Specific forwarding rules must be enforced to prevent loops from 
       happening. This can be achieved using a spanning tree, a shortest 
       path tree, or a split-horizon mesh. 

       It should be noted that the amount of state to be distributed is 
       dependent upon network topology and the number of virtual machines. 
       Different forms of caching can also be utilized to minimize state 
       distribution between the various elements. The control plane should 
       not require an NVE to maintain the locations of all the tenant 
       systems whose VNs are not present on the NVE. The use of a control 
       plane does not imply that the data plane on NVEs has to maintain all 
       the forwarding state in the control plane. 

    4.2.2. Coordination between data plane and control plane 

       For an L2 NVE, the NVE needs to be able to determine MAC addresses 
       of the end systems connected via a VAP. This can be achieved via 
       dataplane learning or a control plane. For an L3 NVE, the NVE needs 
       to be able to determine IP addresses of the end systems connected 
       via a VAP. 

       In both cases, coordination with the NVE control protocol is needed 
       such that when the NVE determines that the set of addresses behind a 
       VAP has changed, it triggers the local NVE control plane to 
       distribute this information to its peers. 

    4.2.3. Handling Broadcast, Unknown Unicast and Multicast (BUM) traffic 

       There are two techniques to support packet replication needed for 
       broadcast, unknown unicast and multicast: 

          o Ingress replication 

     
     
    Lasserre, et al.       Expires August 4, 2013                [Page 20] 
        

















    Internet-Draft  Framework for DC Network Virtualization  February 2013 
     

          o Use of underlay multicast trees 

       There is a bandwidth vs state trade-off between the two approaches. 
       Depending upon the degree of replication required (i.e. the number 
       of hosts per group) and the amount of multicast state to maintain, 
       trading bandwidth for state should be considered. 

       When the number of hosts per group is large, the use of underlay 
       multicast trees may be more appropriate. When the number of hosts is 
       small (e.g. 2-3), ingress replication may not be an issue. 

       Depending upon the size of the data center network and hence the 
       number of (S,G) entries, but also the duration of multicast flows, 
       the use of underlay multicast trees can be a challenge. 

       When flows are well known, it is possible to pre-provision such 
       multicast trees. However, it is often difficult to predict 
       application flows ahead of time, and hence programming of (S,G) 
       entries for short-lived flows could be impractical. 

       A possible trade-off is to use in the underlay shared multicast 
       trees as opposed to dedicated multicast trees. 

    4.2.4. Path MTU 

       When using overlay tunneling, an outer header is added to the 
       original frame. This can cause the MTU of the path to the egress 
       tunnel endpoint to be exceeded.  

       In this section, we will only consider the case of an IP overlay. 

       It is usually not desirable to rely on IP fragmentation for 
       performance reasons. Ideally, the interface MTU as seen by a Tenant 
       System is adjusted such that no fragmentation is needed. TCP will 
       adjust its maximum segment size accordingly. 

       It is possible for the MTU to be configured manually or to be 
       discovered dynamically. Various Path MTU discovery techniques exist 
       in order to determine the proper MTU size to use: 

          o Classical ICMP-based MTU Path Discovery [RFC1191] [RFC1981] 

               o 
                Tenant Systems rely on ICMP messages to discover the MTU of 
                 the end-to-end path to its destination. This method is not 
                 always possible, such as when traversing middle boxes 
                 (e.g. firewalls) which disable ICMP for security reasons 

     
     
    Lasserre, et al.       Expires August 4, 2013                [Page 21] 
        

















    Internet-Draft  Framework for DC Network Virtualization  February 2013 
     

          o Extended MTU Path Discovery techniques such as defined in 
            [RFC4821] 

       It is also possible to rely on the overlay layer to perform 
       segmentation and reassembly operations without relying on the Tenant 
       Systems to know about the end-to-end MTU. The assumption is that 
       some hardware assist is available on the NVE node to perform such 
       SAR operations. However, fragmentation by the overlay layer can lead 
       to performance and congestion issues due to TCP dynamics and might 
       require new congestion avoidance mechanisms from then underlay 
       network [FLOYD]. 

       Finally, the underlay network may be designed in such a way that the 
       MTU can accommodate the extra tunneling and possibly additional nvo3 
       header encapsulation overhead. 

    4.2.5. NVE location trade-offs  

       In the case of DC traffic, traffic originated from a VM is native 
       Ethernet traffic. This traffic can be switched by a local virtual 
       switch or ToR switch and then by a DC gateway. The NVE function can 
       be embedded within any of these elements. 

       There are several criteria to consider when deciding where the NVE 
       function should happen: 

          o Processing and memory requirements 

              o Datapath (e.g. lookups, filtering, 
                 encapsulation/decapsulation) 

              o Control plane processing (e.g. routing, signaling, OAM) and 
                 where specific control plane functions should be enabled 

          o FIB/RIB size 

          o Multicast support 

              o Routing/signaling protocols 

              o Packet replication capability 

              o Multicast FIB 

          o Fragmentation support

    Internet-Draft  Framework for DC Network Virtualization  February 2013 
     

          o QoS support (e.g. marking, policing, queuing)  

          o Resiliency 

    4.2.6. Interaction between network overlays and underlays 

       When multiple overlays co-exist on top of a common underlay network, 
       resources (e.g., bandwidth) should be provisioned to ensure that 
       traffic from overlays can be accommodated and QoS objectives can be 
       met. Overlays can have partially overlapping paths (nodes and 
       links). 

       Each overlay is selfish by nature. It sends traffic so as to 
       optimize its own performance without considering the impact on other 
       overlays, unless the underlay paths are traffic engineered on a per 
       overlay basis to avoid congestion of underlay resources. 

       Better visibility between overlays and underlays, or generally 
       coordination in placing overlay demand on an underlay network, can 
       be achieved by providing mechanisms to exchange performance and 
       liveliness information between the underlay and overlay(s) or the 
       use of such information by a coordination system. Such information 
       may include: 

          o Performance metrics (throughput, delay, loss, jitter) 

          o Cost metrics 

    5. Security Considerations 

       Nvo3 solutions must at least consider and address the following: 

          . Secure and authenticated communication between an NVE and an 
            NVE management system. 

          . Isolation between tenant overlay networks. The use of per-
            tenant FIB tables (VNIs) on an NVE is essential. 

          . Security of any protocol used to carry overlay network 
            information. 

          . Avoiding packets from reaching the wrong NVI, especially during 
            VM moves.
