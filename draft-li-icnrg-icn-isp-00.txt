1.  Introduction

   ICN (Information-Centric Network) may be deployed over different
   underlying networks, e.g. ad hoc networks, DTN and ISP's networks.
   This document discusses deploying ICN in ISP's existing networks and
   ICN design for ISP.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Deployment Considerations in an ISP

   Information-centric networks can be deployed on top of layer-3 or
   layer-2 networks.  It should be preferable for ISPs to deploy ICN as
   an overlay network on top of layer-3 networks, for the following
   considerations: firstly, in the case of incremental deployment,
   packets between newly deployed content routers have to go through
   ordinary routers which do not understand ICN protocols; secondly,
   content routers should be preferably deployed in areas with
   requirements of reducing cost or improving Quality of Service (QoS),
   and there is no necessity of deployment in areas where QoS
   requirements can be fulfilled, and link cost is lower.

   Content routers may be deployed at the edges of networks close to
   content consumers, for the following considerations: firstly, early
   cache hit at network edges means better QoS and more link cost
   savings; secondly, deploying caches at network edges can mitigate the
   impact of unstable wireless link in the case of mobile access users;
   thirdly, it is easier to handle the requests since traffic is light
   at network edges, and cache hits at network edges reduce the load at
   content routers in core network which forwarding high volume traffic.

   Content routers with huge cache spaces may be deployed in core
   networks to achieve high cache hit rates.  Research on cache, e.g.
   [web_caching] and [cooperative_caching], shows that both cache size
   and serving user number affect cache hit rate.  Though early cache
   hit is better, cache hit rate at network edge is limited.  An edge
   content router's cache hit rate is limited by its cache size and
   serving user number.  Firstly, in order to reach a high cache hit
   rate, huge cache space is needed.  But it's costly to deploy huge
   cache spaces in large number of edge content routers.  Secondly,
   fewer users are served by an edge content router.  As a result, a
   large proportion of content requests are for one-time access

   contents, and hit rate is limited at network edges.

   It is not necessary to deploy a deep hierarchy of content routers in
   an ISP.  On one hand, it is easier to deploy fewer content routers in
   current network.  On the other hand, it is preferable that the cache
   space of a content router is much bigger that the one in a lower
   tier, which means the number of tiers is small.  Because of the Zipf-
   like distribution of content requests, the cache size must grow
   exponentially when the tier grows.  Otherwise, cache hit rate of each
   non-bottom tier is very low.


4.  Routing and Caching Control

   There are two ways to collect topology data and generate routing
   table, self-generation and centralized generation.  In the self-
   generation way, content routers run a routing protocol to exchange
   topology data inside an AS or among ASes.  Then each content router
   runs a routing algorithm locally to generate a routing table.
   Alternatively, inside an AS, content routing tables can be generated
   by the centralized way.  In this way, one or more controllers collect
   topology data, and generate routing tables for content routers.  Then
   the controller(s) sends route entries to content routers.

   There are also two ways to control caching.  A content router can
   decide to cache a content or not on its own by running a cache
   replacement algorithm like LRU or LFU.  However, an ISP may also want
   to use centralized controller(s) to enforce some cache policies.

   An ISP may utilize centralized controller(s) to enforce routing and
   cache policy under following considerations.  First, to meet QoS
   requirement, an ISP may decide routing path and cache resource
   assignment based on factors like content type, content download
   frequency and distance to content source.  Second, to reduce link
   cost, an ISP may assign more cache resource for the contents passing
   through costly links by controlling routing path and/or cache
   priority.  Third, to balance link load and cache load, an ISP may
   optimize routes based on load status.  Fourth, an ISP may provide
   better services to paid users or content providers by controlling
   routing path and/or cache priority.

   To control routing and caching, an ICN controller may need to collect
   not only topology data and traffic data, but also content data like
   content type and content download frequency.

   The above figure shows an example of ICN in an ISP.  In this example,
   there are two tiers of content routers, a tier of edge content
   routers with small cache spaces and a tier of centric content routers
   with huge cache spaces.  To store massive contents, the centric
   content routers use cache clusters.  The ICN network is an overlay
   network deployed over IP network.  An ICN controller is responsible
   for generating routing tables and sending route entries to content
   routers.  Content request routing in the example is shown in the
   figure below.
