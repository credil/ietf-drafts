Internet-Draft           PCP Description Option           September 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document extends the base PCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] with the
   ability to associate a description with a PCP-instantiated mapping:
   DESCRIPTION Option.

   This option can be used in the context of
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-upnp-igd-interworking].

   This option has been defined first in [I-D.boucadair-pcp-extensions].


2.  Format

   This option can be used by a user (or an application) to indicate a
   description associated with a given mapping such as "FTP server", "My
   remote access to my CP router", "Camera", "Network attached storage
   serve", etc.

   Issues related to the usage of this field for troubleshooting or for
   any further usage are out of scope of this document.

        This Option:

         Option Name: Description Option (DESCRIPTION)
         Number: TBA in the optional-to-process range (IANA)
         Purpose: Used to associate a text description with a mapping
         Valid for Opcodes: MAP, PEER
         Length: Variable
         May appear in: both request and response
         Maximum occurrences: 1


                       Figure 1: Description Option

   Description field carries the description text.

3.  Behaviour

   DESCRIPTION Option is optional to be supported by PCP Servers and PCP
   Clients.

   This option (Code TBA, Figure 1) MAY be included in a PCP MAP/PEER
   request to associate a description with the requested mapping.

   The PCP Server MAY be configurable to accept the DESCRIPTION Option.
   If the PCP Server does not support the DESCRIPTION Option or it is
   configured to reject it, received DESCRIPTION Options MUST be ignored
   by the PCP Server and no DESCRIPTION Option MUST be included in the
   response.  The PCP Server MUST store the content of DESCRIPTION
   Option only if it supports the DESCRIPTION Option and if it is
   configured to accept handling DESCRIPTION Options it receives.

   If the PCP Client does not receive a DESCRIPTION Option in a response
   to a request enclosing a DESCRIPTION Option, this means the PCP
   Server does not support that Option.  The PCP Client SHOULD avoid
   including the DESCRIPTION Option in any subsequent request to that
   PCP Server.

   If the DESCRIPTION Option is not included in the request, the PCP
   Server MUST NOT include the DESCRIPTION Option in the associated
   response.

   The maximum length SHOULD be configurable in the PCP Server.  If a
   PCP Client includes a DESCRIPTION PCP Option with a length exceeding
   the maximum length supported by the PCP Server, only the portion of
   the Description field fitting that maximum length is stored by the
   PCP Server and returned to the PCP Client in the response.  If the
   PCP Server receives a DESCRIPTION option having a length which does
   not exceed the maximum value configured, the PCP Server MUST record
   the complete sequence of the description text and MUST send back to
   the PCP Client the same DESCRIPTION Option as the one included in the
   request.

   The PCP Client MUST NOT include empty DESCRIPTION Option (i.e.,
   Length set to 0) in a request.  Empty DESCRIPTION Options MUST be
   ignored by the PCP Server.


4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] must be
   considered.
