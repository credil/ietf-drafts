1.  Introduction

   This document describes the usage of HTTP for Registration Data
   Directory Services.  The goal of this document is to tie together
   usage patterns of HTTP into a common profile applicable to the
   various types of Directory Services serving Registration Data using



Newton, et al.          Expires January 04, 2014                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft               RDAP over HTTP                    July 2013


   RESTful practices.  By giving the various Directory Services common
   behavior, a single client is better able to retrieve data from
   Directory Services adhering to this behavior.

   The registration data expected to be presented by this service is
   Internet resource registration data - registration of domain names
   and Internet number resources.  This data is typically provided by
   WHOIS [RFC3912] services, but the WHOIS protocol is insufficient to
   modern registration data service requirements.  A replacement
   protocol is expected to retain the simple transactional nature of
   WHOIS, while providing a specification for queries and responses,
   redirection to authoritative sources, support for Internationalized
   Domain Names (IDNs, [RFC5890]), and support for localized
   registration data such as addresses and organisation or person names.

   In designing these common usage patterns, this document introduces
   considerations for a simple use of HTTP.  Where complexity may
   reside, it is the goal of this document to place it upon the server
   and to keep the client as simple as possible.  A client
   implementation should be possible using common operating system
   scripting tools.

   This is the basic usage pattern for this protocol:

   1.  A client issues an HTTP query using GET.  As an example, a query
       for the network registration 192.0.2.0 might be http://
       example.com/ip/192.0.2.0.

   2.  If the receiving server has the information for the query, it
       examines the Accept header field of the query and returns a 200
       response with a response entity appropriate for the requested
       format.

   3.  If the receiving server does not have the information for the
       query but does have knowledge of where the information can be
       found, it will return a redirection response (3xx) with the
       Location: header field containing an HTTP(S) URL (Uniform
       Resource Locator) pointing to the information or another server
       known to have knowledge of the location of the information.  The
       client is expected to re-query using that HTTP URL.

   4.  If the receiving server does not have the information being
       requested and does not have knowledge of where the information
       can be found, it returns a 404 response.

   5.  If the receiving server will not answer a request for policy
       reasons, it will return an error response (4xx) indicating the
       reason for giving no answer.

   It is important to note that it is not the intent of this document to
   redefine the meaning and semantics of HTTP.  The purpose of this
   document is to clarify the use of standard HTTP mechanisms for this
   application.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   As is noted in SSAC Report on WHOIS Terminology and Structure
   [SAC-051], the term "WHOIS" is overloaded, often referring to a
   protocol, a service and data.  In accordance with [SAC-051], this
   document describes the base behavior for a Registration Data Access
   Protocol (RDAP).  [SAC-051] describes a protocol profile of RDAP for
   Domain Name Registries (DNRs), the Domain Name Registration Data
   Access Protocol (DNRD-AP).

   In this document, an RDAP client is an HTTP User Agent performing an
   RDAP query, and an RDAP server is an HTTP server providing an RDAP
   response.  RDAP query and response formats are described in other
   documents in the collection of RDAP specifications, while this
   document describes how RDAP clients and servers use HTTP to exchange
   queries and responses.

3.  Design Intents

   There are a few design criteria this document attempts to meet.

   First, each query is meant to return either zero or one result.  With
   the maximum upper bound being set to one, the issuance of redirects
   is simplified to the known query/response model used by HTTP
   [RFC2616].  Should an entity contain more than one result, some of
   which are better served by other servers, the redirection model
   becomes much more complicated.

   Second, the semantics of the request/response allow for future and/or
   non-standard response formats.  In this document, only a JSON
   [RFC4627] response media type is noted, with the response contents to
   be described separately.  This document only describes how RDAP is
   transported using HTTP with this format.

   Third, this protocol is intended to be able to make use of the range
   of mechanisms available for use with HTTP.  HTTP offers a number of
   mechanisms not described further in this document.  Operators are
   able to make use of these mechanisms according to their local policy,
   including cache control, authorization, compression, and redirection.

Internet-Draft               RDAP over HTTP                    July 2013


   HTTP also benefits from widespread investment in scalability,
   reliability, and performance, and widespread programmer understanding
   of client behaviours for RESTful web services, reducing the cost to
   deploy Registration Data Directory Services and clients.

4.  Queries

4.1.  Accept Header

   To indicate to servers that an RDAP response is desired, clients
   include an Accept: header field with an RDAP specific JSON media
   type, the generic JSON media type, or both.  Servers receiving an
   RDAP request return an entity with a Content-Type: header containing
   the RDAP specific JSON media type.

   This specification does not define the responses a server returns to
   a request with any other media types in the Accept: header field, or
   with no Accept: header field.  One possibility would be to return a
   response in a media type suitable for rendering in a web browser.

4.2.  Query Parameters

   Servers MUST ignore unknown query parameters.  Use of unknown query
   parameters for cache-busting is described in Appendix B.

5.  Types of HTTP Response

   This section describes the various types of responses a server may
   send to a client.  While no standard HTTP response code is forbidden
   in usage, at a minimum clients SHOULD understand the response codes
   described in this section as they will be in common use by servers.
   It is expected that usage of response codes and types for this
   application not defined here will be described in subsequent
   documents.

5.1.  Positive Answers

   If a server has the information requested by the client and wishes to
   respond to the client with the information according to its policies,
   it returns that answer in the body of a 200 response.

5.2.  Redirects

   If a server wishes to inform a client that the answer to a given
   query can be found elsewhere, it returns either a 301 response code
   to indicate a permanent move, or a 302, 303 or 307 response code to
   indicate a non-permanent redirection, and it includes an HTTP(s) URL
   in the Location: header field.  The client is expected to issue a



Newton, et al.          Expires January 04, 2014                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               RDAP over HTTP                    July 2013


   subsequent request to satisfy the original query using the given URL
   without any processing of the URL.  In other words, the server is to
   hand back a complete URL and the client should not have to transform
   the URL to follow it.

   For this application, such an example of a permanent move might be a
   Top Level Domain (TLD) operator informing a client the information
   being sought can be found with another TLD operator (i.e. a query for
   the domain bar in foo.example is found at http://foo.example/domain/
   bar).

   For example, if the client sends http://serv1.example.com/weirds/
   domain/example.com, the server redirecting to https://
   serv2.example.net/weirds2/ would set the Location: field to the
   value: https://serv2.example.net/weirds2/domain/example.com.

5.3.  Negative Answers

   If a server wishes to respond that it has no information regarding
   the query, it returns a 404 response code.  Optionally, it MAY
   include additional information regarding the negative answer in the
   HTTP entity body.

   If a server wishes to inform the client that information about the
   query is available, but cannot include the information in the
   response to the client for policy reasons, the server MUST respond
   with an appropriate response code out of HTTP's 4xx range.  Clients
   MAY retry the query based on the respective response code.

5.4.  Malformed Queries

   If a server receives a query which it cannot interpret as an RDAP
   query, it returns a 400 response code.  Optionally, it MAY include
   additional information regarding this negative answer in the HTTP
   entity body.

5.5.  Rate Limits

   Some servers apply rate limits to deter address scraping and other
   abuses.  When a server declines to answer a query due to rate limits,
   it returns a 429 response code as described in [RFC6585].  A client
   that receives a 429 response SHOULD decrease its query rate, and
   honor the Retry-After header field if one is present.

Internet-Draft               RDAP over HTTP                    July 2013


   Note that this is not a defense against denial-of-service attacks,
   since a malicious client could ignore the code and continue to send
   queries at a high rate.  A server might use another response code if
   it did not wish to reveal to a client that rate limiting is the
   reason for the denial of a reply.

5.6.  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

   When responding to queries, it is RECOMMENDED that servers use the
   Access-Control-Allow-Origin header field, as specified by
   [W3C.CR-cors-20130129].

6.  Extensibility

   For extensibility purposes, this document defines an IANA registry
   for prefixes used in JSON [RFC4627] data serialization and URI path
   segments (see Section 8).

   Prefixes and identifiers SHOULD only consist of the alphabetic ASCII
   characters A through Z in both uppercase and lowercase, the numerical
   digits 0 through 9, underscore characters, and SHOULD NOT begin with
   an underscore character, numerical digit or the characters "xml".
   The following describes the production of JSON names in ABNF
   [RFC5234].

   ABNF for JSON names


     name = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" )


                                 Figure 1

   This restriction is a union of the Ruby programming language
   identifier syntax and the XML element name syntax and has two
   purposes.  First, client implementers using modern programming
   languages such as Ruby or Java can use libraries that automatically
   promote JSON names to first order object attributes or members.
   Second, a clean mapping between JSON and XML is easy to accomplish
   using these rules.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not pose strong security requirements to the RDAP
   protocol.  However, it does not restrict against the use of security
   mechanisms offered by the HTTP protocol.

Internet-Draft               RDAP over HTTP                    July 2013


   This document made recommendations for server implementations against
   denial-of-service (Section 5.5) and interoperability with existing
   security mechanism in HTTP clients (Section 5.6).

   Additional security considerations to the RDAP protocol will be
   covered in future RFCs documenting specific security mechanisms and
   schemes.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  RDAP Extensions Registry

   This specification proposes an IANA registry for RDAP extensions.
   The purpose of this registry is to ensure uniqueness of extension
   identifiers.  The extension identifier is used as a prefix in JSON
   names and as a prefix of path segments in RDAP URLs.

   The production rule for these identifiers is specified in Section 6.

   In accordance with RFC5226, the IANA policy for assigning new values
   shall be Specification Required: values and their meanings must be
   documented in an RFC or in some other permanent and readily available
   reference, in sufficient detail that interoperability between
   independent implementations is possible.

   The following is a preliminary template for an RDAP extension
   registration:

      Extension identifier: the identifier of the extension

      Registry operator: the name of the registry operator

      Published specification: RFC number, bibliographical reference or
      URL to a permanent and readily available specification

      Person & email address to contact for further information: The
      names and email addresses of individuals for contact regarding
      this registry entry

      Intended usage: brief reasons for this registry entry

   The following is an example of a registration in the RDAP extension
   registry:

      Extension identifier: lunarNic

      Registry operator: The Registry of the Moon, LLC

9.  Internationalization Considerations

9.1.  URIs and IRIs

   Clients can use IRIs [RFC3987] for internal use as they see fit, but
   MUST transform them to URIs [RFC3986] for interaction with RDAP
   servers.  RDAP servers MUST use URIs in all responses, and again
   clients can transform these URIs to IRIs for internal use as they see
   fit.

9.2.  Language Identifiers in Queries and Responses

   Under most scenarios, clients requesting data will not signal that
   the data be returned in a particular language or script.  On the
   other hand, when servers return data and have knowledge that the data
   is in a language or script, the data SHOULD be annotated with
   language identifiers whenever they are available, thus allowing
   clients to process and display the data accordingly.

   The mechanism for including a language identifier in a response will
   be defined in subsequent documents describing specific response
   formats.

9.3.  Language Identifiers in HTTP Headers

   Given the description of the use of language identifiers in
   Section 9.2, unless otherwise specified servers SHOULD ignore the
   HTTP [RFC2616] Accept-Language header field when formulating HTTP
   entity responses, so that clients do not conflate the Accept-Language
   header with the 'lang' values in the entity body.

   However, servers MAY return language identifiers in the Content-
   Language header field so as to inform clients of the intended
   language of HTTP layer messages.

Appendix A.  Protocol Example

   To demonstrate typical behaviour of an RDAP client and server, the
   following is an example of an exchange, including a redirect.  The
   data in the response has been elided for brevity, as the data format
   is not described in this document.

   An example of an RDAP client and server exchange:


     Client:
         <TCP connect to rdap.example.com port 80>
         GET /ip/203.0.113.0/24 HTTP/1.1
         Host: rdap.example.com
         Accept: application/rdap+json

Appendix B.  Cache Busting

Internet-Draft               RDAP over HTTP                    July 2013


   Some HTTP [RFC2616] cache infrastructure does not adhere to caching
   standards adequately, and could cache responses longer than is
   intended by the server.  To overcome these issues, clients can use an
   adhoc and improbably used query parameter with a random value of
   their choosing.  As Section 4.2 instructs servers to ignore unknown
   parameters, this is unlikely to have any known side effects.

   An example of using an unknown query parameter to bust caches:


     http://example.com/ip/192.0.2.0?__fuhgetaboutit=xyz123



   Use of an unknown parameter to overcome misbehaving caches is not
   part of any specification and is offered here for informational
   purposes.
