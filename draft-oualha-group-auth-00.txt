Abstract

   This Internet-Draft presents a new scheme that enables the
   simultaneous re-authentication of a group of nodes in an efficient
   manner. The Internet-Draft proposes to aggregate the re-
   authentications of multiple network nodes members of the same group. 
   The scheme is based on the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
   framework, defined in RFC 3748. As an example of operation, a method
   inspired from EAP-GPSK RFC 5433, is provided.

1. Introduction

   The initial authentication of a node, sometimes referred to as
   bootstrapping, is generally followed by subsequent re-
   authentications either in a periodic-basis or because of node
   mobility. In some situations, a group of nodes are required to
   perform re-authentication at the same time. For example, nodes may

   have the same mobility pattern, so they arrive at the same time to a
   new network and need to re-authenticate. In another example, nodes
   may be part of the same network that is subject to some
   administrative changes (e.g., gateway replacement) that require
   nodes to re-authenticate. Besides temporal or spatial proximity of
   nodes, nodes with the same interest to access a given resource or
   service, all may also need to authenticate to the service provider
   to gain access.

   By forming a group of nodes, re-authentications can be aggregated
   within the group of nodes. The advantages of message aggregation are
   multiple:

   o In-network message aggregation allows to reduce the number of
      authentication messages exchanged between the group of nodes and
      the authentication server (typically, the number of messages goes
      from n to log(n) with aggregation). The communication medium, in
      which access is the most expensive element for sensors/actuators
      for example, is less solicited.

   o Thanks to aggregation, the network is less congested. In
      particular, the load at intermediary nodes in the network (e.g.,
      routers) is reduced, making the risk of having a bottleneck
      diminished.

   o The proposed scheme aims to collectively authenticate multiple
      nodes, but the result of authentication concerns each individual
      node. In contrast with the group-based solution proposed in [10],
      the scheme allows to authenticate nodes individually, while
      authentication messages are aggregated.

   The present Internet-Draft defines the new scheme based on
   aggregated authentications. It also extends the EAP authentication
   framework [3] with the ability to aggregate multiple re-
   authentications.

2. Terminology

   This document uses frequently the terms described in [3] and [4].
   The following is a remainder of the used terms:

   Variables:

   ID_Server: Server identity as an opaque blob.

   ID_Group: The identity of the group of nodes. The format of the
   group ID (e.g., application-based identity, IP multicast address)
   depends on how the group is formed.

   PD_Payload: Data carried within the protected data payload.

   PD_Payload_Block: Block of possibly multiple PD_Payloads carried by
   a packet.

   RAND_Server: Random integer generated by the server (32 octets).

   Operations:

   ENC_(Y): Encryption of message Y with a symmetric key X, using a
   defined block cipher.

   SIGN X(Y): Signature of message Y with a key X, using a defined
   digital signature scheme. For the server, the signature is provided
   using an asymmetric key e.g., based on RSA, or using a symmetric
   group key e.g., based on TESLA [11]. For the node, the signature is
   a keyed message authentication code computed over Y with symmetric
   key X.

   SEC_X(Y): SEC is a function that provides integrity protection based
   on a chosen ciphersuite.  The function SEC uses the algorithm
   defined by the selected ciphersuite and applies it to the message
   content Y with key X. In short, SEC_X(Y) = Y || SIGN_X(Y).

   xor{M}: Aggregation of messages M with an XOR operation. For
   example, xor{M, M', M"} = M xor M'xor M".

   Keys:

   PSK: Long-term key shared between the peer and the server.

   MK: A session-specific Master Key between a node and authentication
   server. MK is derived from PSK as defined in [4].

   PK_p: Session key generated from the MK as defined in [4] and used
   during protocol exchange to encrypt protected data.

   PK_s: Session key generated from a group key (e.g., TESLA [11]) or
   securely shared using an asymmetric key (e.g., server RSA key).

   SK_p: Session key generated from the MK as defined in [4] and used
   during protocol exchange to demonstrate knowledge of the PSK.

   SK_s: Symmetric key derived from a group key (e.g., TESLA [11]) or
   asymmetric key (e.g., server RSA key).

3. Approach overview

   In the proposed scheme, a group of nodes (sensors/actuators) are re-
   authenticating simultaneously to an authentication server.

   The nodes are authenticating to gain access to the network or to a
   remote resource or service. In the first case, they may connect
   through a gateway; while in the second case, their authentication
   messages may go through a service provider (as defined in [6]). The
   authentication server and the gateway/service provider can be co-
   located (see Figure 1 for a network example).

         the authentication server through two gateways (GW1, GW2).



3.1. Assumptions

   The scheme relies on the following assumptions.

3.1.1. Network topology

   The scheme considers a network with a topology established according
   to a destination oriented directed acyclic graph. This type of
   topology allows to multicast a common message from a destination to
   a group of nodes of the network. It allows also to aggregate
   messages originated from a group of nodes toward a destination,
   called reverse multicast.

   The network topology can be implemented using an application-based
   multicast scheme or an IP-multicast routing scheme (e.g., RPL [5]).

3.1.2. Secure group communications

   Integrity-protected communications between the group of nodes is
   preferable, in order to minimize pollution attacks, in which

Internet-Draft               group-auth                   October 2013


   attackers insert bogus information into aggregated messages to
   distort the aggregated result.

   The group of nodes is identified by a group ID (e.g., IP multicast
   address).

3.1.3. Aggregatable messages

   The response messages provided by nodes to a given challenge should
   be aggregatable, i.e. messages are aggregated into one message
   smaller than the sum of response messages. Only the aggregated
   result is sent to the authentication server, hence the original
   messages are not available for veri.cation. Still, the
   authentication server should be able to validate the aggregated
   result based on security credentials shared individually with each
   node.

3.2. Message exchanges

   The authentication approach relies on challenge-response messages,
   in which a common challenge is sent to all nodes in the group, and
   nodes' responses are aggregated back to the authentication server.

   The first two exchanged messages in a typical EAP authentication
   protocol, generally concern identity request and response. In the
   proposed approach, these messages can be omitted. The identity of
   the group is implicitly acknowledged by the server. Alternatively,
   the root node of the group may send the group ID to the
   authentication server, if requested by the server.

   The server initiates the message flow by sending a challenge message
   to the group of nodes identified by a group ID. The challenge may
   contain information authenticating the server, if mutual
   authentication is provided. In this case, the server uses either an
   asymmetric key (i.e., digital signature) or a symmetric group key
   (e.g., TESLA [11]).

   Intermediary nodes (e.g., routers) in the group does not immediately
   answer the challenge, instead they wait for their child nodes to
   answer the challenge.

   As the server challenge is received by the leaf nodes in the group,
   these latter send their responses to their parent nodes. The nodes
   use security credentials (e.g., pairwise secret keys) shared with
   the authentication server to generate the response to the challenge.
   They may also authenticate the origin of the received message, if
   mutual authentication is provided.

Internet-Draft               group-auth                   October 2013


   Upon receiving the responses of all child nodes (or after a
   timeout), the intermediary nodes aggregate the received responses
   with their own response, and send the result to their parent nodes.
   Optionally, in case, some of the child nodes do not answer the
   challenge after a timeout because of unavailability (in sleeping
   mode) or failure, their IDs are added to a list that is sent along
   with the aggregated result.

   The aggregated result is finally sent to the authentication server.
   The server checks the received aggregated response. If validation
   succeeds/fails, a common success/failure message is sent to all
   nodes of the group.

   The list of nodes of the group that did not answer the challenge
   sent along with the aggregated result, is used by the server to
   correctly validate the aggregated result, and to send a
   success/failure message only to nodes that participate in the
   authentication process.

   The messages exchanges are summarized in Figure 2.

4. Extensions to EAP-GPSK

   As an example of realization, the EAP-GPSK [4] method is extended to
   support the proposed approach.

   Extensions concern mainly the EAP server part at the validation
   phase i.e., the server checks an aggregated result instead of one


oualha                 Expires April 21, 2014                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               group-auth                   October 2013


   individual response. At the nodes' side, to be able to authenticate
   server messages, an asymmetric key (i.e., digital signature) or a
   group key (e.g., TESLA [11] group key) are used instead of pairwise
   keys, like it is defined in the original EAP-GPSK.

   Additionally, the first identity request/response messages in the
   protocol are not used. The cipher suite used in the exchange is
   already selected by the server. Nodes that join the group commit to
   the selected cipher suite.

   An extension independent of EAP is also needed at intermediary nodes
   to aggregate responses based on an XOR operation.

   We consider three entities involved in the exchange of EAP messages:
   the end node, the intermediary node (it belongs to the group), and
   the authentication server. A successful extended protocol exchange
   is presented in F                       .igure 3.

      M-6: xor{M-5}

5. Security Considerations

   The proposed scheme does not incur substantial changes to the
   original EAP authentication scheme. Authentication is provided by
   demonstrating the knowledge of a secret key: the server uses an
   asymmetric key or a group key to authenticate, while nodes rely on
   their PSK shared with the server. As demonstrated in [9], the
   aggregated result cannot be produced without the knowledge of the
   secret keys. So message aggregation does not reduce the security of
   the protocol.

   The protocol can be still subject to disruption attacks (i.e.,
   denial of service attacks) where, in particular, attackers inject
   false information into the aggregated result. The obtained result
   that is sent to the server is not validated. This type of attacks
   can be limited by securing communications inside the group, such
   that outsider attackers cannot inject bogus information. Insider
   pollution attacks are possible, though.
