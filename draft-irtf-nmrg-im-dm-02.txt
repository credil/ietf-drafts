There has been ongoing confusion about the differences between
Information Models and Data Models for defining managed objects in
network management.  This document explains the differences between
these terms by analyzing how existing network management model
specifications (from the IETF and other bodies such as the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) or the Distributed
Management Task Force (DMTF)) fit into the universe of Information
Models and Data Models.

This memo documents the main results of the 8th workshop of the
Network Management Research Group (NMRG) of the Internet Research
Task Force (IRTF) hosted by the University of Texas at Austin.

This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of this
memo is unlimited.
