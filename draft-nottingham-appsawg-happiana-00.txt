1.  Introduction

   While the audience for many IANA registries is fairly narrow (often
   being limited to those active in the IETF), there are some which are
   used by broader groups.

   These registries often see requests from third parties who aren't as
   familiar with the operating procedures of the IETF nor IANA, and
   therefore sometimes find the registration process frustrating.

   This document makes recommendations for making such registries
   friendlier to their users.  They are not intended to be applied to
   all registries.


2.  Recommendations for Registration Procedures

2.1.  Use the lowest barrier-to-entry registration procedure possible

   Registries are most useful when they reflect the protocol elements
   actually in use.  However, some see them as having more of a
   "gatekeeper" function, where they only reflect "approved" values that
   are "good" (by some metric).

   See also [I-D.leiba-iana-policy-update].

2.2.  Explain the expert reviewer function

   Further to the above, registries that use expert reviewers are
   encouraged to carefully define how that role works.  Generally, it
   should be seen as a shepherding function, rather than a filtering
   one; the goal of the expert should be to facilitate registrations as
   quickly as possible.

   This may involve, for example, registering a protocol element that
   isn't yet completely specified, in anticipation of updating it with
   more accurate or complete information later.

2.3.  Clearly identify points of contact

   Registrants often multiple parties; e.g.,the IESG, the IANA and
   sometimes an expert reviewer, depending on the registration process
   chosen.

   When this is the case, the point of contact for initial registration
   should always be defined as IANA, and responsibility at each stage of
   the registration process should be carefully identified.

   Likewise, the document defining a new registry should provide a URL
   [RFC3986] to the registry at IANA (coordinating allocation of the URL
   with IANA as necessary).

2.4.  Allow reservation

   Protocols and their extensions are usually the product of a long
   process.  Authors often want to "hold" a value until they complete
   their specification.  To accommodate these cases, registries should
   allow a value to be reserved for future use, and the registry should
   reflect this as soon as possible (e.g, with a value of "reserved",
   along with a note about the reservation).

2.5.  Allow third-party registration

   Unregistered values sometimes become commonly used.  To maintain the
   usefulness of the registry -- both as a reference as well as a
   mechanism to avoid conflicts -- registration procedures SHOULD allow
   registration of already deployed protocol elements by those other
   than their creators.

   When this happens, every effort should be made to properly attribute
   the source, common use, and (if applicable) appropriate change
   controller.

2.6.  Have a 'status' field

   Context is important in registries; it's important, for example, to
   differentiate between reserved entries (as per above) and those that
   have completed the process.

   It is recommended that registries that require some level of
   consensus (e.g., IETF Review) have the following potential statuses:

   o  Standard (registered through a consensus process)
   o  Reserved (held for future use)
   o  Obsoleted (mapping to the 'obsoleted' and 'historic' states in
      [RFC2026])

   It is recommended that registries with lower requirements for
   consensus (e.g., First Come First Served, Specification Required) use
   the following:

   o  Registered (has been registered)
   o  Reserved (held for future use)
   o  Deprecated (has been withdrawn)

   Note that these are only recommended defaults; registries may wish to

   use additional or different statuses.

2.7.  Have a simple procedure for updating contacts

   Registrants' contact details should be able to be updated by
   contacting IANA, even for registries which require a higher level of
   consensus.

   Likewise, non-disputed changes in control for a registration should
   be defined as being handled exclusively by IANA.


3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not specify a protocol, and does not have direct
   security impact.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not directly impact IANA.
