        Encoding of Time Intervals for the TCP Timestamp Option
             draft-trammell-tcpm-timestamp-interval-01.txt

Abstract

   The TCP Timestamp option would be useful for additional measurements
   if it could be assumed that the interval between ticks of the
   timestamp clock are regular, and if that interval were known.  In
   practice, many implementations do use a timestamp clock source that
   has a regular interval.  This draft specifies a compact encoding for
   exposing the timestamp interval to a receiver, and discusses
   applications therefor.

1.  Introduction

   The Timestamp option originally introduced in [RFC1323] was designed
   to support only two very specific mechanisms, round trip time
   measurement (RTTM), and protection against wrapped sequence numbers
   (PAWS), assuming a particular TCP algorithm (Reno).

   While [RFC1323] specifies only that timestamps "must be at least
   approximately proportional to real time" to support RTTM, many
   implementations generate timestamp values from a regular timing
   source.  Determining the real-time interval represented by a single
   tick makes additional measurements possible.  In addition to easing
   passive measurements using the timestamp option, it also makes
   possible the measurement of inter-departure time; the comparison of
   inter-departure time to inter-arrival time can be used to one-way
   delay variation measurement, useful for congestion control algorithms
   as well in QoS applications.

   This document specifies a compact encoding for timestamp intervals
   which can be exported via any number of mechanisms, either through a
   new TCP option, by piggybacking on the timestamp option as in
   [I-D.scheffenegger-tcpm-timestamp-negotiation], or through other in-
   or out-of-band means.  This document specifies an experimental TCP

   option for experiments with interval exposure separate from any other
   mechanism.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Terms defined in [RFC1323] are used in this document as defined
   there.

   This document defines the following additional term:

   Timestamp interval
      The interval between two ticks of the timestamp clock source
      running at a constant frequency.  Note that the timestamp clock is
      not required to be identical with the TCP clock, even though most
      implementations use the same clock for practical purposes.

3.  Timestamp interval exposure

   This section describes the requirements for interval encoding, then
   specifies an interval to meet these requirements based on a 16-bit
   reduced-precision encoding of a 42-bit fixed-point unsigned integer.

3.1.  Interval encoding requirements

   The choice of a timestamp interval is generally implementation-
   specific, and there are a small number of commonly chosen intervals.
   However, a general solution must support not only common cases, but
   uncommon ones, and provide future flexibility to allow an
   implementation to dynamically choose new timestamp intervals for new
   sockets, based on network conditions and specific requirements for
   timestamp measurements.

   There are some sensible bounds on the range of timestamp intervals
   that must be reasonably supported.  The minimum inter-packet interval
   for 64-byte packets (i.e., back-to-back ACK segments) on a future 400
   Gigabit Ethernet would be about 1ns; smaller intervals need not be
   supported with current technology, even for applications for which a
   unique timestamp for every packet would be useful.  On the other side
   of the scale, low-bandwidth, high-latency links may operate with
   timestamp intervals on the order of seconds.

   The precision required by timestamp interval export, on the other
   hand, is determined by the applications for which the information
   will be used and the precision of the underlying clock source.  As

Internet-Draft             Timestamp Intervals                 July 2013


   many clock sources may provide less than maximum precision (due to
   e.g. interrupt jitter), there should be some way to represent
   variable precision.

   As a timestamp interval will need to be bound to a connection in-band
   at runtime, a space-efficient encoding is necessary.

   These requirements indicate a reduced-precision encoding of a fixed-
   point interval, expressed in seconds, as described in the next
   subsection.

3.2.  Interval encoding specification

   A 42-bit fixed-point unsigned integer with 4 bits before the decimal
   point and 38 bits after, expressed in seconds, is sufficient to
   encode an interval range from just under 16 seconds (0x3ff ffff ffff)
   down to 2^-38 s or 3.64 ps (0x000 0000 0001), meeting the range
   requirement.  Sufficient precision for the applications envisioned by
   this document is provided by exporting just the 11 most significant
   bits of the interval value (here, the "value"), coupled with a 5-bit
   "scale" which locates the least significant bit of the value within
   the larger field: a scale of 31 places the value field between bits
   41 and 31 inclusive of the fixed-point integer for the largest
   intervals, while a scale of 0 places the value field between bits 10
   and 0 inclusive.  By using a scale such that the most significant bit
   of the value is not 1, less than 11 bits of precision can be
   signaled, as well; implementations SHOULD NOT represent more
   precision in an exported timestamp interval than they actually
   support.  Full precision export is available down to 2^-27 s (or 7.45
   ns) with diminishing precision down to 3.64 ps.  This arrangement
   therefore allows the representation of timestamp intervals over 13
   orders of magnitude and 11 bits of precision with only two octets.
   The details of this encoding are illustrated in Figure 1.

   This encoded 16-bit interval is then exported for a given connection
   as a standalone TCP option or as part of the extended timestamp
   negotiation described in the following subsections.

   A sender explicitly signals that it uses an irregular timestamp clock
   by sending zero for both scale and value (i.e., 0x0000).
   Combinations of a value of zero and a non-zero scale are reserved for
   future use.  These values MUST NOT be sent as a timestamp interval,
   and SHOULD presently be interpreted by the receiver as exposing an
   irregular timestamp clock.

   For implementations that support only a single timestamp interval for
   all flows in all situations, the encoded interval can be implemented
   as a constant.  Encodings for common timestamp intervals with maximum
   precision are given in Table 1.  Encodings for 9-bit precision, the
   maximum available from common software interrupt clock sources, are
   given in Table 2.

3.3.  Timestamp Interval experimental TCP option

   This section specifies an experimental TCP option, using an ExID and
   magic number as described in [I-D.ietf-tcpm-experimental-options],
   for exporting timestamp intervals.  This option MAY appear in any TCP
   segment after the SYN segment to advertise the sender's timestamp
   interval, encoded as in Section 3.2 above.  If the receiver uses
   timestamp interval information, it stores the interval for the
   duration of the connection, or until a subsequent Timestamp Interval

   option is received.  The receiver may assume the Timestamp Interval
   is applicable from the point of receipt of the option; i.e. that all
   subsequent received segments with the same or a subsequent sequence
   number as the segment containing the option export timestamps with
   the stated option.

   If a sender has previously sent a timestamp interval to a receiver,
   and changes the timestamp interval on the connection, it MUST send a
   new Timestamp Interval option.

   This option MUST NOT appear in a segment in which a TCP Timestamp
   option is also not present.

   Should timestamp interval exposure prove useful, and a separate TCP
   Option be chosen as the preferred method to send it in-band, this
   option would have a length of 4, and the use of an ExID and magic
   number would preserve word alignment in implementations transitioning
   from experimental to production TCP Option usage.

4.  Guidelines for defined-interval timestamp export

   As noted above, implementations SHOULD NOT indicate more precision
   than they support.  As common software interrupt clock sources
   provide about 9 bits of precision, these should be indicated with 2
   leading zero bits in the value field.  Low variance software clocks
   (e.g. CPU cycle counters) should be indicated with a single leading
   zero bit, and hardware injecting the timestamp into the header with
   high precision should use the full precision.  Similarly, if the
   clock source exhibits a very high variability (e.g. when running in a
   virtualized environment), 3 or more leading zeros should be used in
   the value field.

   Timestamp intervals faster than about 1 ms SHOULD be implemented by
   inserting the timestamp "late" before transmitting a segment to avoid
   unnecessary timing jitter.

   Intervals on the order of 1us or less are intended for use with for
   hardware-assisted implementations, e.g. direct use of a (shifted) CPU
   cycle counter as clock source.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses the Experimental Option Experiment Identifier
   (ExID) 0x75ec ffee to identify the Timestamp Interval experimental
   option in Section 3.3; an application for this codepoint in the IANA
   TCP Experimental Option ExID registry has already been submitted.

   New congestion control algorithms are currently proposed, that react
   on the measured one-way delay variation (see
   [I-D.ietf-ledbat-congestion], [Chirp]).  This control variable is
   updated after each received ACK.

   C(t) = TSval(t) - TSecr(t)

   V(t) = C(t) - C(t-1)

   provided that the timestamp clocks at both ends are running at
   roughly the same rate.  Without prior knowledge of the timestamp
   clock interval used by the partner, a sender can try to learn this
   interval by observing the exchanged segments for a duration of a few
   RTTs.  However, such a scheme fails if the partner uses some form of
   implicit integrity check of the timestamp values, which would appear
   as either random scrambling of LSB bits in the timestamp, or give the
   impression of much shorter clock intervals than what is actually
   used.  If the partner uses some form of segment counting as timestamp
   value, without any direct relationship to the wall-clock time, the
   above formula will fail to yield meaningful results.  Finally the
   network conditions need to remain stable during any such training
   phase, so that the sender can arrive at reasonable estimates of the
   partners timestamp clock tick duration.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: the following refers to a mask field which doesn't
   exist anymore, needs a rewrite.  Shouldn't we define C(t) = (TSecr(t)
   - TSval(t)) * (TSinterval(remote) / TSinterval(local))?]

   This note addresses these concerns by providing a means by which both
   host are required to use a timestamp clock that is closely related to
   the wall-clock time, with known clock rate, and also provides means
   by which a host can signal the use of a few LSB bits for timestamp
   value integrity checks.  To arrive at a valid one-way delay (OWD)
   variation, first the timestamp received from the partner has to be
   right-shifted by a known amount of bits as defined by the mask field.
   Next the local and remote timestamp values need to be normalized to a
   common base clock interval (typically, the local clock interval):

                                                         remote interval
   C  = (TSecr >> local mask) - (TSval >> remote mask) * ---------------
    t                                                    local interval

   The adjustment factor can be calculated once during the timestamp
   capability negotiation phase, and pure integer arithmetic can be used
   during per-segment processing:

   EXP.min = min(EXP.loc, EXP.rem)

   EXP.rem -= EXP.min

   EXP.loc -= EXP.min

   FRAC.rem = (0x800 | FRAC.rem) << EXP.rem

   FRAC.loc = (0x800 | FRAC.loc) << EXP.loc

   and assuming that the local clock tick duration is lower

   ADJ = FRAC.rem / FRAC.loc

   with ADJ being a integer variable.  For higher precision, two
   appropriately calculated integers can be used.

   Any previously required training on the remote clock interval can be
   removed, resulting in a simpler and more dependable algorithm.
   Furthermore, transient network effects during the training phase
   which may result in a wrong inference of the remote clock interval
   are eliminated completely.

   Though specified for endpoint usage for congestion control, the
   difference betwen interarrival and interdeparture time used by this
   algorithm is applicable for passive measurement of jitter, as well.
