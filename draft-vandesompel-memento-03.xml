<abstract>

<t>
  The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web by interlinking current resources with resources 
  that encapsulate their past. It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a resource, available from 
  archival resources in Web archives or version resources in content management systems, by leveraging the resource's 
  URI and a preferred datetime. To this end, the framework introduces datetime negotiation (a variation on content negotiation), 
  and new Relation Types for the HTTP "Link" header aimed at interlinking resources with their archival/version resources. 
  It also introduces various discovery mechanisms that further support bridging the present and past Web.

<section title="Introduction">

<section title="Terminology">

<t>
This specification uses the terms "resource", "request", "response", "entity", "entity-body", "entity-header", "content negotiation", 
"client", "user agent", "server" as described in <xref target="RFC2616">RFC 2616</xref>, and it uses the terms "representation" and 
"resource state" as described in <xref target="W3C.REC-aww-20041215">W3C.REC-aww-20041215</xref>.
</t>
  
<t>
  In addition, the following terms specific to the Memento framework are introduced:
</t>

<t><list style="symbols">

<t>
Original Resource: An Original Resource is a resource that exists or used to exist, and for which access 
to one of its prior states is desired.
</t>

<t>
Memento: A Memento for an Original Resource is a resource that encapsulates a prior state of the Original Resource. 
A Memento for an Original Resource as it existed at time Tj is a resource that encapsulates the state that the Original 
Resource had at time Tj. 
</t>

<t>
TimeGate: A TimeGate for an Original Resource is a resource that is capable of negotiation to allow selective, datetime-based, 
access to prior states of the Original Resource. 
</t>

<t>
TimeMap: A TimeMap for an Original Resource is a resource from which a list of URIs of Mementos of the Original Resource is available.
</t>

</list> </t>

</section>

<section title="Purpose">

<t>
The state of an Original Resource may change over time. Dereferencing its URI at any specific moment in time during its existence 
yields a representation of its then current state. Dereferencing its URI at any time past its existence no longer yields a meaningful 
representation, if any. Still, in both cases, resources may exist that encapsulate prior states of the Original Resource. 
Each such resource, named a Memento, has its own URI that, when dereferenced, returns a representation of a prior state of the Original Resource. 
Mementos may, for example, exist in Web archives, Content Management Systems, or Revision Control Systems.

  <t>
    In the abstract, Memento introduces a mechanism to access versions of Web resources that:
  </t>
  
  <t><list style="symbols">
    
    <t>Is fully distributed in the sense that resource versions may reside on multiple hosts, and that any such host 
      is likely only aware of the versions it holds;</t>
    
    <t>Uses the global notion of datetime as a resource version indicator and access key;</t>
    
    <t>Leverages the following primitives of <xref target="W3C.REC-aww-20041215">W3C.REC-aww-20041215</xref>: 
      resource, resource state, representation, content negotiation, 
      and link.</t>
    
  </list></t>
  
  <t>The core components of Memento's mechanism to access resource versions are:</t>
    
    <t>
      1. The abstract notion of the state of a resource identified by URI-R as it existed at some time Tj. 
      Note the relationship with the ability to identify a the state of a resource at some datetime Tj by means of a URI  
      as intended by the proposed Dated URI scheme <xref target="I-D.masinter-dated-uri">I-D.masinter-dated-uri</xref>. 
    </t>
    
    <t>
      2. A bridge from the present to the past, consisting of:
    </t>
    
<t><list style="symbols">
      
      <t>An appropriately typed link from a resource identified by URI-R to an associated TimeGate identified by URI-G, 
        which is aware of (at least part of the) version history of the resource identified by URI-R;</t>
      
      <t>The ability to content negotiate in the datetime dimension with the TimeGate identified by URI-G, 
        as a means to obtain a representation of the state that the resource identified by URI-R had at some datetime Tj.</t>
      
    </list></t>
    
    <t>
      3. A bridge from the past to the present, consisting of an appropriately typed link from a resource identified by URI-M, 
      which encapsulates the state a resource identified 
      by URI-R had at some datetime Tj, to the resource identified by URI-R.
    </t>
  
  <t>
    <xref target="component-1.1"></xref> and <xref target="component-1.2"></xref> of this document are concerned 
    with specifying an instantiation of these abstractions for resources that are identified by HTTP(S) URIs, whereas

<section title="The Memento Framework, Datetime Negotiation component: HTTP headers, HTTP Link Relation Types" anchor="component-1.1">

  <t>
    The Memento framework is concerned with Original Resources, TimeGates, Mementos, and TimeMaps that are identified by HTTP or HTTPS URIs. 
    Details are only provided for resources identified by HTTP URIs but apply similarly to those with HTTPS URIs.
  </t>

<section title="HTTP Headers">

<t>
The Memento framework operates at the level of HTTP request and response headers. It introduces two new headers 
("Accept-Datetime", "Memento-Datetime"), introduces new values for two existing headers ("Vary", "Link"), 
and uses an existing header ("Location") without modification. All these headers are described below. 
Other HTTP headers are present or absent in Memento response/request cycles as specified by <xref target="RFC2616">RFC 2616</xref>.
</t>

<section title="Accept-Datetime, Memento-Datetime" anchor="Accept-Memento-Datetime">

<t>
The "Accept-Datetime" request header is used by a user agent to indicate it wants to retrieve a representation of a Memento 
that encapsulates a past state of an Original Resource. To that end, the "Accept-Datetime" header is conveyed in an 
HTTP GET/HEAD request issued against a TimeGate for an Original Resource, and its value indicates the datetime of 
the desired past state of the Original Resource. 
The "Accept-Datetime" request header has no defined meaning for HTTP methods 
other than HEAD and GET.
</t>

<t>
The "Memento-Datetime" response header is used by a server to indicate that the response contains a representation of a Memento, 
and its value expresses the datetime of the state of an Original Resource that is encapsulated in that Memento. 
The URI of that Original Resource is provided in the response, as the Target IRI (see <xref target="RFC5988">RFC5988</xref>) 
  of a link provided in the HTTP "Link" header that has a 
  Relation Type of "original" (see <xref target="Link-Header-Relation-Types"></xref>).
</t>

<t>
    The presence of a "Memento-Datetime" header and associated value for a given resource constitutes a promise that the resource 
    is stable and that its state will no longer change. This means that, in terms of the Ontology for Relating Generic and Specific Information Resources
  (see <xref target="W3C.gen-ont-20090420">W3C.gen-ont-20090420</xref>), a Memento is a FixedResource.</t>
  
  <t>As a consequence, "Memento-Datetime" headers associated with a Memento MUST be "sticky" in the following ways:</t>  
  
  <t><list style="symbols">
    
    <t>The server that originally assigns the "Memento-Datetime" header and value 
      MUST retain that header in all responses to HTTP HEAD/GET requests (with or without "Accept-Datetime" header) 
      that occur against the Memento after 
      the time of the original assignment of the header, and it MUST NOT change its associated value.</t>   
    <t>Applications that mirror Mementos at a different URI MUST NOT change 
      the "Memento-Datetime" header and value of those Mementos unless mirroring involves a meaningful state change.
      This allows, for example, duplicating a Web archive at a new location while preserving the 
      value of the "Memento-Datetime" header of the archived resources. In this example, the "Last-Modified" header 
      will be updated to reflect the time of mirroring at the new URI, whereas the value for "Memento-Datetime" 
      will be sticky.</t>      
    
  </list></t>
  

  
<section title="Values for Accept-Datetime" anchor="accept-datetime">

<t>Values for the "Accept-Datetime" header consist of a MANDATORY datetime expressed according to the 
    <xref target="RFC1123">RFC 1123</xref> format, which is formalized by the rfc1123-date construction 
    rule of the BNF in <xref target="datetime-BNF"></xref>, and an OPTIONAL interval indicator expressed according to 
  the iso8601-interval rule of the BNF in <xref target="datetime-BNF"></xref>. The datetime MUST be represented 
  in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
</t> 
  
  <t>
    Examples of "Accept-Datetime" request headers with and without an interval indicator:
  </t>
  
  <figure>
    <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[ 
Accept-Datetime: Thu, 31 May 2007 20:35:00 GMT
Accept-Datetime: Thu, 31 May 2007 20:35:00 GMT; -P3DT5H;+P2DT6H
]]></artwork>
  </figure>
  
  <t>
  The user agent uses the MANDATORY datetime value 
  to convey its preferred datetime for a Memento; it uses the OPTIONAL interval indicator to convey 
  it is interested in retrieving 
  Mementos that reside within this interval around the preferred datetime, and not interested in Mementos that reside outside of it.
  Not using an interval indicator is 
  equivalent to expressing an infinite interval around the preferred datetime.
  </t>
  
  <t>
    The interval mechanism can be regarded as an implementation of the functionality intended by 
  the q-value approach that is used in regular content negotiation. The q-value approach is not supported for Memento's 
  datetime negotiation 
  because it is well-suited for negotiation over a discrete space of mostly predictable values, not for negotiation over a continuum of 
  unpredictable datetime values.

<section title="Vary">

<t>
The "Vary" response header is used in responses to indicate the dimensions in

For example, this use of the "Vary" header indicates that datetime is the only dimension in which negotiation was applied:
</t>

<figure>

  <section title="Link">
    
    <t>
      The "Link" response header is specified in <xref target="RFC5988">RFC5988</xref>. 
      The Memento framework introduces new Relation Types to convey typed links among Original Resources, TimeGates, Mementos, and TimeMaps.
      Already existing Relation Types, among others, aimed at supporting navigation among a series of ordered resources may also be used 
      in the Memento framework. 
      This is detailed in <xref target="Link-Header-Relation-Types">Link Header Relation Types</xref>, below.

<t>
"timegate" -- A "Link" header entry with a Relation Type of "timegate" is used to point both from an Original Resource  
or a Memento to a TimeGate for the Original Resource. In both cases, the use of an entry with the "timegate" 
Relation Type is RECOMMENDED. Since more than one TimeGate can exist for any Original Resource, multiple entries with a "timegate" 
Relation Type MAY occur, each with a distinct Target IRI. Since a TimeGate has no mime type, the "type" attribute MUST NOT be used 
on Links with a "timegate" Relation Type.

<section title="Relation Type &quot;timemap&quot;">

<t>
"timemap" -- A "Link" header entry with a Relation Type of "timemap" is used to point from both a TimeGate 
or a Memento to a TimeMap resource from which a list of Mementos known to the responding server is available. 
Use of an entry with the "timemap" Relation Type is RECOMMENDED, and, since multiple serializations of a TimeMap are possible,
multiple entries with a "timemap" Relation Type MAY occur, each with a distinct Target IRI, and each with a MANDATORY 
"type" attribute to convey the mime type of the TimeMap serialization. Details for the entry are as follows:

<section anchor="memento-rel" title="Relation Type &quot;memento&quot;">

<t>
"memento" -- A "Link" header entry with a Relation Type of "memento" is used to point from  
both a TimeGate and a Memento to various Mementos for an Original Resource. 
This link MUST include a "datetime" attribute with a value that matches the "Memento-Datetime" 
of the Memento that is the target of the link; that is, 
the value of the "Memento-Datetime" header that is returned when the URI of the linked Memento is dereferenced. 
In addition, the link MAY include an "embargo" attribute to convey the datetime until which the Memento will remain inaccessible. 
The value for both the "datetime" and "embargo" attributes MUST be a datetime expressed according 
to the rfc1123-date construction rule of the BNF in <xref target="datetime-BNF"></xref> and it MUST be represented 
  in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
This link MAY also include a "license" attribute to associate a license with the Memento; the value for the "license" 
attribute SHOULD be a URI.  The link SHOULD also 
include a "type" attribute to convey the mime type of the Memento that is the target of the link.
Use of entries with the "memento" Relation Type is REQUIRED and it MUST be as follows:
</t>
  
  <t>For all responses to HTTP HEAD/GET requests issued against a TimeGate or a Memento in which 
    a Memento is selected or served by the responding server:</t>

      (sorted by ascending "Memento-Datetime" values) known to the server.</t>
    <t>Other "memento" links MAY only be included if both the aforementioned previous and next links are provided. 
      Each of these OPTIONAL 
      "memento" links MUST have as Target IRI the URI of a Memento other than the ones listed above.</t>

   <t>Other "memento" links MAY be included, and each of these OPTIONAL links MUST have as Target IRI the URI of a Memento other 
      than the two listed above.</t>
  </list></t>
   
  <t>Note that the Target IRI of some of these links may coincide. For example, if the selected Memento actually is the first 
    Memento known to the server, only three distinct "memento" links may result. The value for the "datetime" attribute of these links would 
    be the datetimes of the first (equal to selected), next, and most recent Memento known to the responding server.</t>

  <section title="The Memento Framework, Datetime Negotiation component: HTTP Interactions" anchor="component-1.2">

  <t>This section describes the HTTP interactions of the Memento framework for a variety 
    of scenarios. First, <xref target="intro-flow"></xref> provides a schematic overview of a successful request/response chain that 
    involves datetime negotiation. Dashed lines depict HTTP transactions between user agent and server. <xref target="AppendixFlow"></xref> 
    shows these HTTP interactions in detail for the case where the Original Resource resides on one server, 
    whereas both the TimeGate and the Mementos reside on another. Scenarios also exist in which all these resources 
    are on the same server (for example, Content Management Systems) or on different servers (for example, an aggregator of TimeGates). 
    Note that, in Step 2 and Step 6, the HTTP status code of the response is shown as 
    "200 OK", but a series of "206 Partial Content" responses could be substituted without loss of generality.

        Step 1: In order to determine what the URI is of a TimeGate for an Original Resource, 
        the user agent issues an HTTP HEAD/GET request against the URI of the Original Resource (URI-R).
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Step 2: The entity-header of the response from URI-R includes an HTTP "Link" header

      </t>
      
      <t>
        Step 3: The user agent starts the datetime negotiation process with the TimeGate by issuing 
        an HTTP GET request against its URI-G thereby including an "Accept-Datetime" 
        HTTP header with a value of the datetime of the desired prior state of the Original Resource.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Step 4: The entity-header of the response from URI-G includes a "Location" header pointing at

        In addition, the entity-header contains an HTTP "Link" header with a Relation Type of "original" 
        pointing at the Original Resource, and an HTTP "Link" header with a Relation Type

            A user agent MAY ignore the TimeGate returned in Step 2. However, when engaging in a Memento

            SHOULD always start the cycle by issuing an HTTP GET/HEAD against the Original Resource 
            (Step 1, <xref target="a200-step1-http"></xref>) as it is an important way 
            to learn about dedicated or preferred TimeGates for the Original Resource. Also, cases exist in which the response

<t>
  In order to respond to a datetime negotiation request (Step 3, <xref target="HTTP_TimeGate_client"></xref>), 
  the server uses an internal algorithm to select the Memento that best meets the user agent's 
  datetime preference, and redirects to it. The exact nature of the selection algorithm is at the server's discretion
  but SHOULD be consistent. A variety of approaches can be used including selecting the Memento 
  that is nearest in time (either past or future) or nearest in the past relative to the requested datetime.
  The commons scenario for datetime negotiation with a TimeGate is 
  described in <xref target="HTTP_TimeGate_server_OK"></xref> but special cases exist, 
  and they are addressed in <xref target="ua_range"></xref> through 
  <xref target="TG_other"></xref>.
  </t>
  
<section title="Successful Scenario" anchor="HTTP_TimeGate_server_OK">
      
  <t>
    In cases where the TimeGate exists, and 
    the datetime provided in the user agent's "Accept-Datetime" header can be parsed and 
    does not contain an interval indicator, 
    the server selects a Memento based 
    on the user agent's datetime preference. The response MUST have a "302 Found" HTTP status code, 
    and the "Location" header MUST be used to convey the URI of the selected Memento.  
    The "Vary" header MUST be provided and it MUST include the "negotiate" and "accept-datetime" values
    to indicate that datetime negotiation has taken place. The "Link" header MUST be provided and contain links with Relation Types 
      subject to the considerations described in <xref target="Link-Header-Relation-Types"></xref>. The response MUST NOT contain a 
    "Memento-Datetime" header.
    Such a response is illustrated in <xref target="a200-step4-http"></xref>.

    Note that if a user agent's "Accept-Datetime" header does not convey an interval indicator, 
    and conveys a datetime that is 
    either earlier than the datetime of the first Memento or later than the datetime of the most recent Memento

          <t>In case, in Step 3,  
            the datetime provided in the user agent's "Accept-Datetime" header can be parsed, 
            and contains an interval indicator, the response depends on whether the server is or is not 
            aware of Mementos with datetimes within the expressed interval. 
            If the server is aware of such Mementos, 
            the server's response MUST be as in <xref target="HTTP_TimeGate_server_OK"></xref>.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            However, if the responding server is not aware of any 
            Mementos with "Memento-Datetime" values within the expressed interval, 
            the server's response MUST have a "406 Not Acceptable" 
            HTTP status code. The use of the "Vary" header MUST be as described in <xref target="HTTP_TimeGate_server_OK"></xref>. 
            The use of the "Link" header MUST be as described in <xref target="Link-Header-Relation-Types"></xref>.
            Specifically, the use of links with a "memento" Relation Type MUST follow the rules  
            for the case where no Memento is selected by the responding server (<xref target="memento-rel"></xref>) 
            and it is RECOMMENDED 
            that the server provides "memento" links pointing at Mementos that have "Memento-Datetime" values

          <t>As a result, a user agent that allows for the provision of an interval indicator in requests

            for their resolution. For example, the client can leverage the "memento" links returned by the 
            responding server, can extend its preferred interval, or can remove it from further requests.</t>

            When interacting with a TimeGate, the regular content negotiation dimensions (media type, 
            character encoding, language, and compression) remain available. 
            It is the TimeGate server's responsibility to honor (or not) such 
            content negotiation, and in doing so it MUST always first select a Memento that meets 
            the user agent's datetime preference, and then 
            consider honoring regular content negotiation for it. As a result of this approach, the returned Memento will not 
            necessarily meet the user agent's regular content negotiation preferences. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that the server 
            provides HTTP Links with a "memento" Relation Type pointing at Mementos that do meet the user agent's regular content 
            negotiation requests and that have a value for the "Memento-Datetime" header 
            in the temporal vicinity of the user agent's preferred datetime value.

            Cases may occur in which a user agent issues a request against a TimeGate that does not exist. This may, 
            for example, occur when a user agent uses internal knowledge to construct the URI of an assumed, yet non-existent TimeGate.
            In these cases, the response from the target server MUST have a "404 Not Found" HTTP status code, and SHOULD include a 
            "Vary" header that includes the "negotiate" and "accept-datetime" values as an indication that, generally, 
            the server is capable of datetime negotiation. 
            The response MUST NOT include a "Link" header with any of the Relation Types introduced in <xref target="memento-rels"></xref>, 
            and it MUST NOT contain a "Memento-Datetime" header.

    <t>
      When a user agent issues a HTTP HEAD/GET request against an assumed TimeGate URI 
      (e.g. URI is Target IRI of a link with a "timegate" 
      Relation Type, URI is discovered as described in <xref target="TimeGate_Discovery"></xref>, etc.), 
it SHOULD NOT conclude that the 
      targeted resource effectively is a TimeGate and hence will behave 
      as described in <xref target="HTTP_TimeGate_server"></xref>. 
    </t>
    
    <t>
      A user agent MUST decide it has reached a TimeGate if the response to a HTTP HEAD/GET request against the resource's URI contains 
      a "Vary" header that includes the "negotiate" and "accept-datetime" values. If the response does not, the user agent MUST decide it has 
      not reached a TimeGate and proceed as follows:
    </t>
    
    <t><list style="symbols">     
      <t>
        If the response contains a redirection, the user agent SHOULD follow it. Note that a chain of redirections is possible, e.g. 
        URI-R -> URI-1 -> URI-2 -> ... -> URI-G
      </t>   
      <t>
        If the response does not contain a redirection, or if the redirection (chain) does not lead to a TimeGate,
        the user agent SHOULD attempt to determine an appropriate TimeGate for the 
        Original Resource, either automatically or interactively supported by the user.  
        The discovery mechanisms described in 
        <xref target="component-2"></xref> can support the user agent with this regard.
      </t>  
    </list></t>

    <t>
    Resources that are not TimeGates (i.e. do not behave as described in <xref target="HTTP_TimeGate_server"></xref>) MUST NOT 
    use a "Vary" header that includes the "accept-datetime" value. 
    </t>
    
    <t>
      In certain cases, it is possible to implement Memento support 
      in such a manner that an Original Resource coincides with its TimeGate, 
      i.e. URI-R and URI-G are the same. This implementation pattern is NOT RECOMMENDED.
      It can make determining whether a resource is a TimeGate more challenging, 
      and, more importantly, it may cause problems with caches.

      must take care to avoid, include:

If the Memento requested by the user agent in Step 5 exists,

in the Memento.  
The "Link" header MUST be provided and contain links subject to the considerations described in 
  <xref target="Link-Header-Relation-Types"></xref>.
  The Target IRI and, when applicable, the datetime values in the "Link" 
  header associated with the "memento" Relation Type SHOULD be the same as conveyed in Step 4, in case the TimeGate and the selected

<t>
The server's response MUST include the "Memento-Datetime" header regardless whether the user agent's 
request contained an "Accept-Datetime" header or not. This is the way by which resources make explicit that they are 
Mementos. Due to the sparseness of Mementos in most archives, 
the value of the "Memento-Datetime" header returned by a server may differ 
(significantly) from the value conveyed by the user agent in "Accept-Datetime".
</t>
  
  <t>
    Although a Memento encapsulates a prior state of an Original Resource, the entity-body returned in response to an HTTP GET 
    request issued against a Memento may very well not be byte-to-byte the same as an entity-body that was previously returned 
    by that Original Resource. Various reasons exist why there are significant chances these would be different yet do convey 
    substantially the same information. These include format migrations as part of a digital preservation strategy, 
    URI-rewriting as applied by some Web archives, and the addition of banners as a means to brand Web archives. 
  </t>

  </section>
  
  <section anchor="HTTP_Memento_redirect" title="Memento of a 3XX Response">
    
    <t>Cases exist in which HTTP responses with 3XX status codes are archived. 
    For example, crawl-based web archives commonly archive responses with 
    HTTP status codes "301 Moved Permanently" and "302 Found" whereas Linked Data 
    archives hold on to "303 See Other" responses. But also other 3XX responses 
    may be archived.</t>
    
    <t>If the Memento requested by the user agent is an archived version of an 
      HTTP response with a 3XX status code, the server's response MUST 
      have the same 3XX HTTP status code, 
      and it MUST include a "Memento-Datetime" header with a value equal to the 
      archival datetime of the original 3XX response.  
      All other considerations, e.g. pertaining to the use of "Link" header, 
      expressed in <xref target="HTTP_Memento_common"></xref> apply.</t>
    
    <t>The client's handling of a HTTP response with a 3XX status code is not 
      affected by the presence of a "Memento-Datetime" header.  The
      client SHOULD behave in the same manner as it does with HTTP responses with a 3XX 
      status code that do not have a "Memento-Datetime" header. For example:</t>
      
      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>For a response from a Memento that has a 3XX status code and 
          contains a "Location" header, 
          the client SHOULD continue on to the URI specified in that header.</t>
        <t>For a response from a Memento that has a "300 Multiple Choices" status code, 
        the response body SHOULD be presented to the user to allow selection of a URI.</t>
      </list></t>
      
      <t>However, the client MUST be aware that the URI that was selected 
        from the HTTP response with a 3XX status code might not be that of a Memento 
        but rather of an Original Resource.
        In that case it SHOULD proceed by looking for a Memento of the 
        selected Original Resource.</t>
    
    <t>For example, on April 11 2008 <xref target="memento-redirect-2"></xref>
      is the response to an HTTP GET request for http://a.example.org. This 
      response is archived as a Memento of http://a.example.org, 
      and this Memento's URI is http://arxiv.example.net/web/20080411000650/http://a.example.org.
      The response to a HTTP HEAD/GET on this Memento is shown in <xref target="memento-redirect-3"></xref>.
    In essence, it is a replay of the original response with "Memento-Datetime" and 
    "Link" headers added, to allow a client to understand the response is a Memento. 
    In <xref target="memento-redirect-3"></xref>, the value of the "Location" 
      header is the same as in the original response; it identifies an Original Resource. 
      The client proceeds with finding a Memento for this Original Resource.
    Web archives sometimes overwrite the value that was originally provided in the 
    "Location" header in order to point at a Memento they hold 
    of the resource to which the redirect originally led. This is shown in <xref target="memento-redirect-4"></xref>.
      In this case, the client may decide it found an appropriate Memento.

    <t>
      Cases may occur in which a server that hosts Mementos does not expose a TimeGate for those Mementos. 
      This can, for example, be the case if the server's Mementos result from taking a 
      snapshot of the state of a set of Original Resources from another server at the time this other server is being retired. 
      As a result, only a single Memento per Original Resource is hosted, making the introduction of a TimeGate 
      unnecessary. But it may also be the case for servers that hosts multiple Mementos for an Original Resource but consider 
      exposing TimeGates too expensive.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      In cases of Mementos without associated TimeGates, responses to a request for a Memento by a user agent MUST be as described in 
      <xref target="HTTP_Memento_server"></xref> with the exception that it will not contain a HTTP "Link" 
      with a &quot;timegate&quot; Relation Type pointing at a TimeGate exposed by the responding server. It MAY still 
      contain such a Link pointing at a TimeGate exposed elsewhere. Depending on whether one or more Mementos are hosted for 
      an Original Resource, the response may or may not have a 
      HTTP Link with a &quot;timemap&quot; Relation Type.
      However, the response MUST still contain a "Memento-Datetime" response header 
      with a value 
      that corresponds to archival datetime of the Memento.

<t>
Cases may occur in which a TimeGate's response (Step 4) points at a Memento that actually does not exist, resulting in a user agent's request 
(Step 5) for a non-existent Memento. In this case, the server's response MUST have the expected "404 Not Found" HTTP Status Code and it MUST NOT 
contain a "Memento-Datetime" header.
Note that the absence of a Memento in an archive is distinct from the case 
of an archived response with a "404 Not Found" HTTP status code as is described in 
  <xref target="HTTP_Memento_other"></xref>

  <section title="Recognizing a Memento" anchor="redirect_chains_m">
    
    <t>
      When following the redirection provided by a confirmed TimeGate (see <xref target="redirect_chains_tg"></xref>), 
      a user agent SHOULD NOT assume that the targeted resource effectively is a Memento and hence will behave as described in 
      <xref target="HTTP_Memento_server"></xref>.
    </t>
      
      <t>
      A user agent MUST decide it has reached a Memento if the response to a 
      HTTP HEAD/GET request against the resource's URI contains a "Memento-Datetime" header with a legitimate value. 
      If the response does not, the following applies:
      </t>
      
      <t><list style="symbols">    
    <t>
      If the response contains a redirection, the user agent SHOULD follow it. Even a chain of redirections is possible, e.g. 
      URI-G -> URI-X -> URI-Y -> ... -> URI-M.
    </t>  
        <t>If the response by a confirmed TimeGate does not contain a redirection, or if the redirection (chain) that started at a 
          confirmed TimeGate does not lead to a 
          resource that provides a "Memento-Datetime" header, the user agent MAY still conclude that it has likely arrived at a Memento. 
          That is because cases exist in which Web 
      archives and CMS are made compliant with the Memento framework "by proxy". In these cases TimeGates will redirect to Mementos 
      in such systems, but the responses from these Mementos will not (yet) include a "Memento-Datetime" header.

    <section title="Interactions with a TimeMap" anchor="timemap">
     
      
      <t>A TimeMap is introduced to support retrieving a comprehensive list of all Mementos for a specific Original Resource,  
        known to a responding server. 
        The entity-body of a response to an HTTP GET request issued against a TimeMap's URI:</t>
      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>MUST list the URI of the Original Resource that the response lists Mementos for;</t>
        <t>MUST list the URI and datetime of each Memento for the Original Resource known to the responding server;

        <t>MUST list the URI of one or more TimeGates for the Original Resource except when no TimeGate 
          exists (see <xref target="HTTP_Memento_no_TimeGate"></xref>);</t>
        <t>SHOULD, for self-containment, list the URI of the TimeMap itself;</t>
        <t>MUST unambiguously type listed resources as being Original Resource, TimeGate, Memento, or TimeMap.</t>
      </list></t>
      
      <t>
        The entity-body of a response from a TimeMap MAY be serialized in various ways, 
        but the link-value format serialization MUST be supported. 
        In this serialization, the entity-body MUST be formatted in the same way as 
        the value of a HTTP "Link" header, and hence MUST comply to the "link-value" 
        construction rule of "Section 5. The Link Header Field" of <xref target="RFC5988">RFC5988</xref>, and the media type 
        of the entity-body MUST be "application/link-format" as introduced in 
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-link-format">I-D.ietf-core-link-format</xref>. 
        All links conveyed in this serialization MUST be interpreted as having  
        the URI of the Original Resource as their Context IRI. The URI of the Original Resource is provided in the entity-body 
        as the Target IRI 
        of the link with an "original" Relation Type.

          In order to retrieve the link-value serialization of a TimeMap, a user agent SHOULD use an 
          "Accept" request header with a value set to "application/link-format". 
          This is shown in <xref target="TimeMap-request"></xref>.

        <t>If the TimeMap requested by the user agent exists, 
          the server's response MUST have a "200 OK" HTTP status code (or "206 Partial Content", where appropriate). 
          Note that a TimeMap is itself an Original Resource for which Mementos may exist. For example, 
          a response from a TimeMap could provide a "timegate" Link to a TimeGate via which prior TimeMap versions are available. 
          In this case, the use of the "Link" header is subject to all considerations described in 
          <xref target="Link-Header-Relation-Types"></xref>, with the TimeMap acting as the Original Resource.</t> 
          
        <t>However, in case a TimeMap wants to explicitly indicate in its response headers  
          for which Original Resource it is a TimeMap, 
          it MUST do so by including a HTTP "Link" header with the following characteristics:</t>
        
        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The Context IRI for the HTTP Link is the URI of the Original Resource;</t>
          <t>The Relation Type is "timemap";</t>
          <t>The Target IRI for the HTTP Link is the URI of the TimeMap.</t>   
        </list></t>
        <t>Because the Context IRI of this HTTP Link is not the URI of the TimeMap, as per <xref target="RFC5988">RFC5988</xref>, 
          the default Context IRI must be overwritten 
          by using the "anchor" attribute with a value of the URI of the Original Resource.</t>
        
        <t>The response from the TimeMap to the request of <xref target="TimeMap-request"></xref> is shown in 
          <xref target="TimeMap-response"></xref>. The response header shows the TimeMap 
          explicitly conveying the URI of the Original Resource for which it is a TimeMap;
          for practical reasons the entity-body in the example has been abbreviated. 
          Notice also the use of the "license" and "embargo" 
          attributes introduced in <xref target="memento-rel"></xref> on the "memento" links in the TimeMap.</t>

<section title="The Memento Framework, Discovery Component" anchor="component-2">

  <t><xref target="component-1.2"></xref> describes how TimeGates, Mementos, Original Resources, and TimeMaps can be discovered 
  by following HTTP Links with Relation Types "timegate", "memento", "original", and "timemap", respectively.</t>
  
  <t>Naturally, some of these links can also be embedded into representations of resources that 
  have a media type that allows embedding of typed links. For example, an Original Resource that 
  has an HTML representation can include a "timegate" link by using HTML's LINK element, e.g. 
  &lt;link href="http://arxiv.example.net/timegate/http://a.example.org" rel="timegate"&gt;. 
  The use of such embedded links is also subject to the considerations of <xref target="Link-Header-Relation-Types"></xref>.</t> 
 
  <t>In this section additional approaches are introduced that support batch discovery of TimeGates and Mementos. 
    The approaches leverage the Robots Exclusion Protocol.</t>
  
  <section anchor="TimeGate_Discovery" title="Discovering TimeGates Via Robots Exclusion Protocol">
      
      <t>The Robots Exclusion Protocol's robots.txt file <xref target="robotstxt.org"></xref> is commonly used by Web site 
        owners to give instructions about their site to Web robots. It is used both to protect resources hosted by a server 
        from crawling and to facilitate discovering them.
        This document introduces the "TimeGate" and "Archived" directives for robots.txt 
        to provide a server-wide mechanism to support TimeGate discovery that SHOULD be used by:</t>
      
      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>Servers of Original Resources;</t>
        <t>Servers that provide access to Mementos of Original Resources by exposing TimeGates.</t> 
      </list></t>     
    
    <t>A robots.txt file MAY contain zero or more occurrences of the "TimeGate" directive, 
      and each occurrence MUST be followed by one or more associated "Archived" directives.  
      The meaning of the directives is as follows:</t>
    
    <t><list style="symbols">
      <t>TimeGate: Conveys the base URL (that is URI scheme, host and path component) that is shared by all URIs of 
        TimeGates of a set of Original Resources.</t>
      <t>Archived: Indicates - by means of mandatory host and optional path parts of a URI - 
        for which set of Original Resources actual TimeGates are available that have the base URL conveyed 
        in the associated TimeGate directive.</t> 
    </list></t>
    
    <t>For example, consider a wiki at http://a.example.org/w/ that supports the Memento framework and 
      exposes TimeGates to access the wiki's history pages at base URL 
      http://a.example.org/w/index.php/Special:TimeGate/. An actual TimeGate for the wiki's 
      http://a.example.org/w/My_Title page would then be at http://a.example.org/w/index.php/Special:TimeGate/http://a.example.org/w/My_Title. 
      This wiki SHOULD make its TimeGates discoverable by using the directives shown in 
      <xref target="robotstxt1"></xref> in 
      its robots.txt file. 
      </t>

    </figure>

    <t>As another example, consider a server of Original Resources at http://a.example.org/ and 
      http://www.a.example.org/ that is aware that its resources are regularly crawled by a Web archive that 
      generally exposes TimeGates at base URL http://arxiv.example.net/timegate/ and hence 
      has TimeGate http://arxiv.example.net/timegate/http://a.example.org/ to access Mementos for
      http://a.example.org/.
      This server SHOULD make the remote TimeGates discoverable by including the 
      directives shown in <xref target="robotstxt2"></xref> in its robots.txt file:

    <t>And, consider a Web archive that crawls a wide range of Original Resources, 
      and exposes TimeGates to access the resulting Mementos at base URL http://arxiv.example.net/timegate/. 
      In order to make its TimeGates discoverable, this Web archive SHOULD

      Atom Feeds <xref target="RFC4287"></xref> are commonly used to support discovery of news items by humans and are also 
      frequently used for automated discovery by a variety of applications. This section introduces 
      a profile of Atom Feeds named TimeMap Feeds intended to support batch discovery of TimeMaps. The discovery of 
      TimeMap Feeds is in its turn supported by the new "TimeMapFeed" directive for robots.txt.

        <t>Any change to a TimeMap conveyed by an entry MUST result in a change of the updated time of the entry, 
        irrespective of the TimeMap being conveyed by-value or by-reference;</t>
        <t>Depending on the size of the collection of Mementos, a server may need to publish multiple TimeMap Feeds.

      <t>Provision of a "timegate" HTTP "Link" header in responses to requests
        for an Original Resource that is protected (e.g., 401 or 403 HTTP
        response codes) is OPTIONAL. The inclusion of this Link when
        requesting authentication is at the server's discretion; cases may
        exist in which a server protects the current state of a resource,
        but supports open access to prior states and thus chooses to
        supply a "timegate" HTTP "Link" header.  Conversely, the server may
        choose to not advertise the TimeGate URIs (e.g., they exist in an
        intranet archive) for unauthenticated requests.</t>
