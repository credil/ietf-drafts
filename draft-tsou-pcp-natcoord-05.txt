1.  Application Scenario

   PCP can be used to control an upstream device to achieve the
   following goals:

   1.  A plain (i.e., a non-shared) IP address can be assigned to a
       given subscriber because the subscriber subscribed to a service
       which uses a protocol that don't embed a transport number or
       because the NAT is the only deployed platform to manage IP
       addresses.

   2.  An application (e.g., sensor) does not need to listen to a whole
       range of ports available on a given IP address.  Only a limited
       set of ports are used to bind its running services.  For such
       devices, the external port(s) and IP address can be delegated to
       that application and therefore avoid enforcing NAT in the network
       side for its associated flows.  The NAT in the PCP- controlled
       device should be bypassed.

   3.  A device able to restrict its source ports can be delegated an
       external port restricted IP address.  The PCP- controlled device
       should be instructed to by-pass the NAT when handling flows
       destined/issued to that device.

   This document extends PCP with the ability to reserve port set
   instead of individual mapping.  This is motivated by the need to
   offload to a port-restricted device, reduce the logging and enhance
   the performance of the CGN.

   A new PCP OpCode and two new PCP Options are defined in this
   document.


2.  MAP_PORT_SET Opcode

   This section defines a new Opcode which requests port set from a PCP-
   controlled device to a PCP client.  By analogy, a port set binding
   can be seen as an aggregate of MAP mappings.  When assigning a port
   set to a PCP Client, the PCP-controlled device maintains a binding
   between the source IP address of the PCP request, the assigned
   external IP address and port set.  It can greatly reduce individual
   MAP requests for a PCP client when requesting a bulk of ports at one
   time.  This mechanism can be applied for instance to lightweight
   4over6 [l4over6] in port-set allocation process.

   MAP_PORT_SET: Create an explicit dynamic mapping between an Internet
   Address and an External Address + Port set

Internet-Draft   NAT Coordination Using Port Allocation       March 2012


   The format of a port-set can either be contiguous or non-contiguous
   including a cryptographical assigned port set.  The contiguous port-
   set is simple but since the port space for a subscriber shrinks
   significantly, the randomness for the port numbers is decreased
   significantly.  This may allow an attacker to guess the port number
   used.  Non-contiguous port-set, e.g., cryptographical algorithm
   [RFC6431], can be provided to improve the randomness of port number.
   It may be used as a mitigation tool against blind attacks.
   Therefore, in MAP_PORT_SET Opcode, it is mandatory to support two
   port-set options: PORT_MASK Option and
   Cryptographically_Random_Port_set Option.  Besides, PREFERE_FAILURE
   Option would also apply for MAP_PORT_SET Opcode.

   PCP-controlled device SHOULD provide a configuration option to allow
   administrators to configure the size of the port set to be assigned
   and whether cryptographical option is supported or not.

2.1.  MAP_PORT_SET Operation Packet Formats

   The MAP_PORT_SET Opcode has a similar packet layout for both requests
   and response.  The following figure shows the format of the Opcode in
   a request for the MAP_PORT_SET Opcode.

   These fields are described below:

   o  Protocol: the default value is zero (to indicate all transport
      protocols).

   o  Reserved bits: 24 bits MUST be set to 0.

   o  Suggested External IP Address: Suggested external IPv4 or IPv6
      address.  Same as Section 10.1 of [PCP-base].

   These fields are described below:

   o  Protocol: MUST be copied from the request.

   o  Reserved bits: 24 bits MUST be set to 0.

   o  Assigned External IP Address (128 bits): This filed conveys the
      assigned external IPv4 (encoded using IPv4-mapped IPv6 address) or
      IPv6 address for the mapping.  On an error response, the Assigned
      External IP Address is coped from the request.

   o  Requested lifetime (in common header): Requested lifetime for the
      whole port-set mapping, in seconds.  The value 0 also indicates
      "delete" here.

   Discussion note: Assess further whether THIRD_PARTY Option is needed
   for PORTRANGE OpCode.

2.2.  Port-Set Options Formats

   The Port_Set options are used to specify one set of ports pertaining
   to a given IP address.  As defined in [RFC6431],there are three kinds
   of port range: contiguous, non-contiguous and random.  A
   cryptographically random Port Range Option may be used as a
   mitigation tool against blind attacks.  We will describe the two port
   set PCP options in this section.

      The random ports can be achieved by defining a function that takes
      as input a key 'K' and an integer 'x' within the 1024-65535 port
      range and produces an output 'y' also within the 1024-65535 port
      range.

2.3.  Generating a MAP_PORT_SET Request

   The request MAP_PORT_SET MUST contains one of the port-set options,
   either PORT_RANGE option or Cryptographically_Random_Port_Set option.
   The request MAY contain values in the Suggested IP Address field and
   corresponding parameters in PORT_RANGE option.  However, this port
   set indicated in the request of the PCP Client is only a hint; it is
   up to the PCP Server to assign a free port set.

2.4.  Renewing a MAP_PORT_SET Mapping

   The similar actions defined in PCP-BASE specification [section 10.2.1
   of [ID.ietf-pcp-base]] can be applied to MAP_PORT_SET Opcode to
   extend the lifetime of a port-set mapping.  The MAP_PORT_SET request
   SHOULD include the currently assigned IP address and port-set in the
   suggested IP address and port-set options.  The PCP-client should
   renew the port-set mapping before its expiry time.

   [Discussion note: Do we need to cover the case in which a client MAY
   send a request to the LSN for another delegated set of ports?  I
   think we should recommand that the same external IP address.
   Otherwise, the client has to determine which address should be used
   in actual data communication process among multiple external
   addresses.]

2.5.  Processing a MAP_PORT_SET Request

   The procedures regarding to lifetime is similar to the single port
   processes in MAP Opcode [section 10.3 of [ID.ietf-pcp-base]], except
   that the whole port-set should be treated consistently in
   MAP_PORT_SET Opcode.

   The error codes in MAP_PORT_SET Response mainly have the following
   possibilities:

   o  If the PCP server or PCP-controlled device does not support
      MAP_PORT_SET Opcode, the error UNSUPP_OPCODE MUST be returned.

   o  if the PCP server or PCP-controlled device does not support the
      port-set option indicated in MAP_PORT_SET request, the error
      UNSUPP_OPTION MUST be returned.

   o  If an option does not make sense, (e.g., the PREFER_FAILURE Option
      is included in a request with lifetime=0, or MAP_PORT_SET Opcode
      does not include port-set options, etc.,), the request is invalid
      and generates a MALFORMED_OPTION error.  This procedure is the
      same with section 10.3 of [ID.ietf-pcp-base].

Internet-Draft   NAT Coordination Using Port Allocation       March 2012


   o  If the MAP request contains the PREFER_FAILURE Option, but the
      Suggested External Address and Port-set do not match the External
      Address and Port of the existing mapping, the PCP server MUST
      return CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL.

   If all of the preceding operations were successful (did not generate
   an error response), then the requested port-set mapping is created or
   refreshed as described in the request and a SUCCESS response is
   built.  The assigned external IPv4 (encoded using IPv4-mapped IPv6
   address) or IPv6 address for the mapping should be returned.

2.6.  Processing a MAP_PORT_SET Response

   On receiving a MAP_PORT_SET Response, the same procedure as the one
   for individual mapping [section 10.4 of [ID.ietf-pcp-base]] should be
   followed by the PCP Client to validate the response (except the
   considerations related to the internal port).

2.7.  Mapping Lifetime and Deletion

   The procedure for port-set mapping lifetime and deletion is also the
   same with individual mapping [section 10.5 of [ID.ietf-pcp-base]].

2.8.  PREFER_FAILURE Option for MAP_PORT_SET Opcode

   This option [section 10.2 of [ID.ietf-pcp-base]] can be applied to
   MAP_PORT_SET Opcode indicating that if the PCP server cannot map the
   suggested External Address and port-set, the PCP server should not
   create a mapping.


3.  Security Considerations

   None.


4.  IANA Considerations

   The authors request the following new OpCode: MAP_PORT_SET and the
   following two Options: PORT_RANGE Cryptographically_Random_Port_Set
