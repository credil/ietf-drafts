                   Resource Discovery through Proxies
             draft-fossati-core-fp-link-format-attribute-00

Abstract

   The aim of this draft is to open a discussion on how to make it
   possible to advertise the fact that a given resource hosted by a
   server can only be reached through a specific CoAP Proxy.

   This memo proposes the definition of the "fp" (forward proxy) CoAP
   link format attribute, that can be used to inform CoAP endpoints that
   a given resource can be reached by passing through the advertising
   Proxy.

Internet-Draft     Resource Discovery through Proxies          July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The discovery mechanism described in [I-D.ietf-core-link-format]
   assumes cheap and pervasive multicast.  However as discussed in
   [I-D.shelby-core-resource-directory] direct discovery of resources is
   not always practical due to limitations in the underlying radio link
   (see Section 1 of [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd]), the absence of a multicast
   routing protocol to bridge through different links, sleeping nodes,
   disperse networks.

   The Resource Directory (RD) provides a first solution hosting
   descriptions of resources held on other servers and allowing lookups
   to be performed for those resources.  The current solution however
   does not address the scenario where the URI (of the resource of
   interest) is associated to a CoAP origin server that can only be
   accessed through a CoAP proxies either for topological and/or
   security reasons or because it is a sleepy origin server.

   Given their topological role, CoAP Proxies (Section 5.7 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap]) can be used effectively to address the above
   mentioned scenarios.  However, in order to achieve this capability,
   the fact that a given resource is made available through a proxy must
   be made explicit to consuming endpoints, so that they can use the
   Proxy-Uri Option to dereference the final target.

   This memo defines the "fp" (forward proxy) CoAP link format
   attribute, that can be used to inform CoAP endpoints that a given
   resource can be reached by passing through the advertising Proxy.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Proxied Discovery Scenario

   Consider the scenario depicted in Figure 1.  Two separate CoAP links
   are proxied by P. Node A hosts resource /res of type "x", and P knows
   it -- either through explicit or implicit mechanism (e.g. previous
   discovery on the local link, or a co-located RD, etc.)

                                |         |
            </res>;rt="x" (A)---+         |
                                |         |
                                +---(P)---+
                                |         |
                                |         +---(B)
                                |         |

                                 Figure 1

   We would like to allow B to discover that A hosts a resource with
   type "x" even if A can't be directly reached by B.

   P may in principle let this information filter from one link to the
   other, but given the mechanisms currently defined for the discovery
   via /.well-known/core (Section 2.1 of [I-D.ietf-core-link-format]),
   there is no way for a consuming node to ascertain that an advertised
   link is to be accessed through a given forward Proxy or by a direct
   route.

   We may choose to use the anchor parameter in the link and define a
   new relation name to express the "proxied by" relation, but this may
   actually have zero chance to succeed because of the freedom left to a
   consuming node to actually ignore anchored links (Section 2.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-link-format]).


3.  The fp Link Format Attribute

   The proposed solution, instead, envisages a new link format
   attribute, "fp" that is added by the Proxy to the original set of
   attributes of the linked resource to inform the requesting endpoint
   that the advertised (absolute) URI must be requested to the
   advertising Proxy using the Proxy-URI Option, as illustrated in
   Figure 2.  The "fp" link format attribute MAY be set to the Proxy IP
   address.

   When advertised on a link different from the one on which it resides,
   the original resource link SHALL be transformed by the Proxy into an
   absolute URI that can be used as-is in a Proxy-Uri Option by the
   requesting node.

       P      B
       |      |
       |<-----' Uri-Path: .well-known
       |  GET | Uri-Path: core
       |      | Uri-Query: rt=x
       |      |
       `----->| Content-Type: link-format
       | 2.05 | payload: <coap://A/res>;rt="x";fp="proxy IP address"

                                 Figure 2

   Note that in case the "fp" attribute is present, the URI-Reference in
   the link-value [RFC5988] MUST always be a URI and not a relative-ref
   [RFC3986].

   The forwarding path to /res is now set up, and B can reach it through
   P using the Proxy-Uri Options as follows:

                  A      P      B
                  |      |      |
                  |      |<-----' Proxy-Uri: coap://A/res
                  |      |  GET |
                  |<-----'      | Uri-Path: res
                  |  GET |      |
                  |      |      |
                  `----->|      |
                  | 2.05 |      |
                  |      `----->|
                  |      | 2.05 |


4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  fp Attribute

   This section defines a new Web Linking [RFC5988] attribute for use
   with [I-D.ietf-core-link-format].  The "fp" (forward proxy) CoAP link
   format attribute, that can be used by Proxy nodes to inform CoAP
   endpoints that a given resource can be reached by passing through the
   advertising Proxy.


5.  Security Considerations

   The mechanism specified in this document shares the same security
   concerns as the discovery process described in
   [I-D.ietf-core-link-format].

   Especially critical to the CoAP network consistency, is the fact that
   in NoSec mode a malicious attacker could poison the response of a
   query to the /.well-known/core in order to re-route traffic.
