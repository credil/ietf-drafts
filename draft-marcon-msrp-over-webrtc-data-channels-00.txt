                     MSRP over WebRTC data channels
             draft-marcon-msrp-over-webrtc-data-channels-00

Abstract

   The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group is
   charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich
   communication using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-
   browsers.  For the support of data communication, the RTCWeb working
   group has in particular defined the concept of bi-directional data
   channels over SCTP, where each data channel might be used to
   transport other protocols, called sub-protocols.  This document
   specifies how the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) can be
   instantiated as a WebRTC data channel sub-protocol, using the SDP
   offer/exchange to negotiate out-of-band the sub-protocol specific
   parameters.  Two network configurations are documented: a WebRTC end-
   to-end configuration (connecting two MSRP over data channel
   endpoints), and a gateway configuration (connecting an MSRP over data
   channel endpoint with an MSRP over TCP endpoint).

Internet-Draft       MSRP over WebRTC data channels            July 2013


   The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) [RFC4975] is currently
   defined to work over TCP connections.

   The RTCWeb working group has defined the concept of bi-directional
   data channels running on top of SCTP/DTLS.  Each data channel
   consists of paired SCTP streams sharing the same SCTP Stream
   Identifier.  Data channels are created by endpoint applications
   through the WebRTC API, and can be used to transport proprietary or
   well-defined protocols, which in the latter case can be signaled by
   the data channel "sub-protocol" parameter, conceptually similar to
   the WebSocket "sub-protocol".  However, apart from the "sub-protocol"
   value transmitted to the peer, RTCWeb leaves open how endpoint
   applications can agree on how to instantiate a given sub-protocol on
   a data channel, whether it be in-band or out-of-band (or both).  As
   an example, the SDP offer generated by the browser includes no
   channel-specific information.

   MSRP is a protocol for transmitting a series of related instant
   messages in the context of a session.  In addition to instant
   messaging, MSRP can also be used for image sharing or file transfer.

   Defining the MSRP as a data channel sub-protocol has many benefits:

   o  provide to WebRTC applications a proven protocol enabling instant
      messaging, file transfer, image sharing

   o  integrate those features with other RTCWeb voice and video
      features

   o  leverage the SDP-based negotiation already defined for MSRP

   o  allows the interworking with MSRP endpoints running on a TCP
      connection

   This document defines the use MSRP of over WebRTC data channels,
   where one MSRP endpoint is an MSRP WebRTC application and the other
   endpoint is either an MSRP WebRTC application or an MSRP TCP
   application.

Internet-Draft       MSRP over WebRTC data channels            July 2013


      Data channel: A bidirectional channel consisting of paired SCTP
      outbound and inbound streams.

      In-band: transmission through the peer-to-peer SCTP association.

      Out-of-band: transmission through the WebRTC signaling path, using
      JSEP [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-jsep] and the SDP Offer/Answer model
      [RFC3264].

      MSRP data channel: A data channel specifically used to transport
      the messages of one MSRP session.

      Peer: From the perspective of one of the agents in a session, its
      peer is the other agent.  Specifically, from the perspective of
      the SDP offerer, the peer is the SDP answerer.  From the
      perspective of the SDP answerer, the peer is the SDP offerer.

4.  WebRTC Data Channels

   This section summarizes how WebRTC data channels work in general.

   A WebRTC application creates a data channel via the WebRTC Data
   Channel API, by providing a number of setup parameters (sub-protocol,
   label, reliability, order of delivery, priority).

   The browser then opens in-band the data channel using the DATA
   CHANNEL OPEN message defined in [draft-jesup-rtcweb-data-protocol].
   This message carries some of the channel-specific parameters passed
   by the application (sub-protocol, label, reliability, order of
   delivery).

   In case an SCTP association is already established, the browser
   transmits immediately the DATA CHANNEL OPEN message to the peer, on
   an unused SCTP stream.

   In case no SCTP association is established, the browser triggers for
   an SDP offer/answer exchange, and sends the DATA CHANNEL OPEN
   message(s) once the SCTP association is established (i.e.
   subsequently to the reception of the answer).

   The SDP offer generated by the browser is as per [draft-ietf-mmusic-
   sctp-sdp].  In brief, it contains one m-line for the SCTP association
   on top of which data channels will run, and one attribute per
   protocol assigned to the SCTP ports:

   m=application 54111 DTLS/SCTP 5000 5001 5002
   c=IN IP4 79.97.215.79
   a=sctpmap:5000 webrtc-datachannel 16

Internet-Draft       MSRP over WebRTC data channels            July 2013


   a=sctpmap:5001 bfcp 2
   a=sctpmap:5002 t38 1


   Note: A WebRTC browser will only create an sctpmap attribute for the
   webrtc-datachannel protocol, and will not create sctpmap attributes
   for other protocols such as bfcp or t38.  This example shows the
   hypothetical power of the syntax to support multiplexing of SCTP
   associations for different protocols on the same DTLS connection.

   Note: this SDP syntax does not contain any channel-specific
   information.

5.  End-to-end configuration

   This section describes the network configuration where each MSRP
   endpoint is a WebRTC endpoint, running MSRP over an SCTP/DTLS
   connection.

5.1.  Support for SDP-based sub-protocol negotiation

   In the default procedures described in Section 4, the channel-
   specific parameters are notified in-band to the peer, rather than
   negotiated with the peer.  Also, no mechanism is defined to transmit
   subprotocol-specific parameters to the peer.

   This section defines a means to negotiate channel-specific and
   subprotocol-specific parameters, using the out-of-band SDP offer/
   exchange.

5.1.1.  SDP syntax

   The SDP only contains the declaration of data channels for which an
   SDP-based negotiation is required, and that are either being created
   or already opened.

5.1.1.1.  Channel-specific setup parameters

   For each of these data channels, the SDP lists one attribute line
   providing the Stream Identifier, sub-protocol, label, reliability,
   order of delivery, priority.

   a=webrtc-DataChannel:5000 stream=2;label="channel 2"; \
     subprotocol="file transfer";max_retr=3


   NOTE: the related SDP syntax has to be imported from version 3 of
   [draft-ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp].

Internet-Draft       MSRP over WebRTC data channels            July 2013


   This line MUST be replicated without changes in the SDP answer, if
   the answerer accepts the offered data channel.

   This line MUST be replicated without changes in any subsequent offer
   or answer, as long as the data channel is still opened at the time of
   offer or answer generation.

   The Sub-protocol, label, reliability and order of delivery parameters
   MUST be equal to those transmitted in-band in the DATA CHANNEL OPEN
   message.  The Stream Identifier MUST be equal to the SCTP Stream
   Identifier on which the DATA CHANNEL OPEN message is sent.

5.1.1.2.  Sub-protocol specific attributes

   In the SDP, each data channel declaration MAY also be followed by
   other SDP attributes specific to the sub-protocol in use.  Each of
   these attributes is represented by one new attribute line, and it
   includes the contents of a media-level SDP attribute already defined
   for use with this (sub)protocol in another IETF specification.

   Each sub-protocol specific attribute such as "a=accept-types:text/
   plain" that would normally be used to negotiate an instance of MSRP
   is replaced with an attribute of the form "a=wdcsa:sctp-port:stream-
   id original-attribute", where wdcsa stands for "webrtc-DataChannel
   sub-protocol attribute", sctp-port is the sctp port number assigned
   for webrtc-DataChannel on the media line, stream-id is the sctp
   stream id assigned to this instance of MSRP, and original-attribute
   represents the contents of the MSRP related attribute to be included.

   a=webrtc-DataChannel:5000 stream=2;label="channel 2"; \
     subprotocol="MSRP";max_retr=3
   a=wdcsa:5000:2 accept-types:text/plain


   Thus the attribute "a=wdcsa:5000:2 accept-types:text/plain" specifies
   that this instance of MSRP on stream id 2 accepts plain text files.

   As opposed to the data channel setup parameters, these parameters are
   subject to offer/answer negotiation.

   The same syntax applies to any other SDP attribute required for
   negotiation of this instance of the sub-protocol.

5.1.2.  Procedures

5.1.2.1.  Opening a data channel

   Opening a data channel is done in-band by the DATA CHANNEL OPEN
   message.  However when the sub-protocol requires an SDP-based
   negotiation, applications MUST NOT send data on this channel till
   both SDP negotiation and DATA CHANNEL OPEN message sending are done,
   which may happen in any order.

   When the application creates a new data channel (requiring some sub-
   protocol specific negotiation), the browser follows in any case a
   generic behavior:

   o  if no SCTP association is established, the browser triggers the
      SDP negotiation, and sends the DATA CHANNEL OPEN message once the
      answer is received and the SCTP association initialized.

   o  if an SCTP association is established, the browser does not
      trigger any SDP negotiation but instead immediately sends a DATA
      CHANNEL OPEN message.  The application then initiates a new offer/
      answer exchange

   Note: in this case, as the DATA CHANNEL OPEN message is sent before
   the offer is created, Stream ID conflicts between offers sent to the
   peer, and DATA CHANNEL OPEN messages received from the peer should
   not occur.

   The application has the task to complete the browser-generated offer
   (or answer) with the data channel and subprotocol specific parameters
   in scope of the SCTP m-line.  The browser is expected to ignore those
   parameters when the completed offer (or answer) is applied locally.

5.1.2.2.  Closing a data channel

   Closing a data channel is done in-band by the SSN reset mechanism,
   and does not trigger a new offer/answer exchange.

5.2.  Support for MSRP data channels

5.2.1.  Overview

   This document defines how MSRP can be used as a WebRTC sub-protocol,
   where the MSRP-related negotiation is done as part of the SDP-based
   data channel negotiation defined in Section 5.1.1.2.

Internet-Draft       MSRP over WebRTC data channels            July 2013


   In this design, the MSRP connection maps to the SCTP association and
   the port assigned to data channels, and each MSRP session maps to one
   data channel exactly.

5.2.2.  MSRP URI

   This document extends the MSRP URI syntax [RFC3986] by defining the
   new transport parameter value "dc":

   transport  =  "tcp" / "dc" / 1*ALPHANUM


5.2.3.  Session negotiation

   Using the syntax a=webrtc-DataChannel:<port> <param=value>, the SDP
   declaration of a given MSRP data channel can include at least all the
   following well-known parameters:

   o  defined in [RFC4975]: "path", "accept-types", "accept-wrapped-
      types", "max-size"

   o  defined in [RFC4566]: "sendonly", "recvonly", "inactive", and
      "sendrecv"

   o  defined in [RFC6135]: "setup"

   o  defined in [RFC6714]: "msrp-cema"

   o  defined in [RFC5547]: all the parameters related to MSRP file
      transfer

5.2.4.  Session opening

   The MSRP session is normally opened by the active MSRP endpoint,
   which sends an MSRP SEND message (empty or not) to the other MSRP
   endpoint.  The active MSRP endpoint does not use the path attribute
   to open a transport connection to its peer.  Instead, the active MSRP
   endpoint uses the DataChannel established for this MSRP session by
   the procedures in Section 5.1.  The cema attribute is implicitly
   associated with every MSRP session using data channel transport.

5.2.5.  Data sending and reporting

Internet-Draft       MSRP over WebRTC data channels            July 2013


5.2.6.  Session closing

   Either endpoint can close the MSRP session by closing the underlying
   data channel.  Closing an MSRP session should not trigger an SDP
   negotiation.

5.3.  Support for MSRP File Transfer function

   [RFC5547] defines an end-to-end file transfer method based on MSRP
   and the SDP offer/answer mechanism.  This file transfer method is
   also usable by MSRP WebRTC endpoints, with the following
   considerations:

   o  As an MSRP session maps to one data channel, a file transfer
      session maps also to one data channel.

   o  SDP attributes specified in [RFC5547] for a file transfer m-line
      are embedded as subprotocol-specific attributes as defined in
      Section 5.1.1.2.

   o  Each file chunk is transmitted over one SCTP user message.

   o  Once the file transfer is complete, the same data channel MAY be
      reused for another file transfer.

   o  Following the aborting of a file transfer, the SDP can be updated
      by adding the "inactive" attribute to the list of subprotocol-
      specific attributes associated with the corresponding data
      channel.

6.  Gateway configuration

   This section describes the network configuration where one endpoint
   runs MSRP over a WebRTC SCTP/DTLS connection, the other MSRP endpoint
   runs MSRP over one or more TLS/TCP connections, and the two endpoints
   interwork via an MSRP gateway.

   Specifically, a gateway can be configured to interwork an MSRP
   session using a data channel with a peer that does not support data
   channel transport in one of two ways.  In one model, the gateway
   performs as a MSRP B2BUA to interwork all the procedures as necessary
   between the endpoints.  No further specification is needed for this
   model.

   Alternately, the gateway can use CEMA procedures to provide transport
   level interworking between MSRP endpoints using different transport
   protocols as follows.

Internet-Draft       MSRP over WebRTC data channels            July 2013


   When the gateway performs transport level interworking between MSRP
   endpoints, all of the procedures in section Section 5.1 apply to each
   peer, with the following additions:

   o  The endpoint establishing an MSRP session using data channel
      transport shall not request inclusion of any relays, although it
      may interoperate with a peer that signals the use of relays.

   o  The gateway receiving an SDP offer that includes a request to
      negotiate an MSRP session on a data channel can provide transport
      level interworking in the same manner as a CEMA SBC by forwarding
      TCP or TLS transport parameters in a new m line with the
      appropriate attributes within the forwarded SDP offer.

   o  Similarly, a gateway receiving an SDP offer to negotiate an MSRP
      session using TCP or TLS transport with an endpoint that only
      supports data channel transport for MSRP can provide transport
      level interworking in the same manner as a CEMA SBC by
      establishing a new data channel for the MSRP session with the
      target endpoint.
