1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Session Traversal Utilities
   for NAT (STUN) protocol.

   STUN is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in
   dealing with Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal.  It can be
   used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to
   it by a NAT, to perform connectivity checks between two endpoints,
   and used as a keepalive protocol to maintain NAT bindings.  RFC 5389
   [RFC5389] defines the specifics of the STUN protocol.

Internet-Draft                  STUN URI                  September 2013


   The "stun" and "stuns" URI schemes are used to designate a standalone
   STUN server or any Internet host performing the operations of a STUN
   server in the context of STUN usages (Section 14 RFC 5389 [RFC5389]).
   With the advent of standards such as WEBRTC [WEBRTC], we anticipate a
   plethora of endpoints and web applications to be able to identify and
   communicate with such a STUN server to carry out the STUN protocol.
   This also implies those endpoints and/or applications to be
   provisioned with appropriate configuration required to identify the
   STUN server.  Having an inconsistent syntax has its drawbacks and can
   result in non-interoperable solutions.  It can result in solutions
   that are ambiguous and have implementation limitations on the
   different aspects of the syntax and alike.  The 'stun/stuns' URI
   scheme helps alleviate most of these issues by providing a consistent
   way to describe, configure and exchange the information identifying a
   STUN server.  This would also prevent the shortcomings inherent with
   encoding similar information in non-uniform syntaxes such as the ones
   proposed in the WEBRTC Standards [WEBRTC], for example.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when
   they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in ALL CAPS (such
   as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual english meanings, and
   are not to be interpreted as RFC 2119 key words.

3.  Definition of the STUN or STUNS URI

3.1.  URI Scheme Syntax

   A STUN/STUNS URI has the following formal ABNF syntax [RFC5234]:

   stunURI       = scheme ":" stun-host [ ":" stun-port ]
   scheme        = "stun" / "stuns"
   stun-host     = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name
   stun-port     = *DIGIT
   IP-literal    = "[" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture  ) "]"
   IPvFuture     = "v" 1*HEXDIG "." 1*( unreserved / sub-delims / ":" )
   IPv6address   =                              6( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   /                       "::" 5( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [               h16 ] "::" 4( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *1( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 3( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *2( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 2( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *3( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"    h16 ":"   ls32
                   / [ *4( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              ls32
                   / [ *5( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              h16
                   / [ *6( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"
   h16           = 1*4HEXDIG

Internet-Draft                  STUN URI                  September 2013


   ls32          = ( h16 ":" h16 ) / IPv4address
   IPv4address   = dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet
   dec-octet     = DIGIT                 ; 0-9
                   / %x31-39 DIGIT       ; 10-99
                   / "1" 2DIGIT          ; 100-199
                   / "2" %x30-34 DIGIT   ; 200-249
                   / "25" %x30-35        ; 250-255
   reg-name      = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )


   <unreserved>, <pct-encoded>, and <sub-delims> are specified in
   [RFC3986].  The core rules <DIGIT> and <HEXDIGIT> are used as
   described in Appendix B of RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

3.2.  URI Scheme Semantics

   The "stun" and "stuns" URI schemes are used to designate a standalone
   STUN server or any Internet host performing the operations of a STUN
   server in the context of STUN usages (Section 14 RFC 5389 [RFC5389]).
   The STUN protocol supports sending messages over UDP, TCP or TLS-
   over-TCP.  The "stuns" URI scheme MUST be used when STUN is run over
   TLS-over-TCP (or in the future DTLS-over-UDP) and the "stun" scheme
   MUST be used otherwise.

   The required <stun-host> part of the "stun" URI denotes the STUN
   server host.

   For the optional DNS Discovery procedure mentioned in the Section 9
   of RFC5389, "stun" URI scheme implies UDP as the transport protocol
   for SRV lookup and "stuns" URI scheme indicates TCP as the transport
   protocol.

   As specified in [RFC5389], the <stun-port> part, if present, denotes
   the port on which the STUN server is awaiting connection requests.
   If it is absent, the default port is 3478 for both UDP and TCP.  The
   default port for STUN over TLS is 5349 as per Section 9 of [RFC5389].

4.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   [RFC6982] before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6982].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation

   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not

   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC6982], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

5.  Security Considerations

   The "stun" and "stuns" URI schemes do not introduce any specific
   security issues beyond the security considerations discussed in
   [RFC3986].  These URI schemes are intended for use in specific
   environments that involve NAT traversal.  Users of the scheme need to
   carefully consider the security properties of the context in which
   they are using them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the registration information for the "stun" and
   "stuns" URI Schemes (in accordance with [RFC4395]).  Note that these
   URI schemes are intended for use in very specific NAT traversal
   environments, and should not be used otherwise on the open Web or
   Internet.

Appendix B.  Design Notes

   o  The ABNF in this document duplicates the <IP-literal>,
      <IPv4address>, and <reg-name> productions and other dependent
      productions from [RFC3986], instead of referencing them.  This is
      because the definitions in [RFC3986] are for hierarchical URIs, so
      using these references in an opaque URI made reviewers think that
      a hierarchical URI parser could be used to parse the URIs defined
      in this document.

   o  One recurring comment was to stop using the suffix "s" on URI
      scheme, and to move the secure option to a parameter (e.g.,
      ";proto=tls").  We decided against this idea because the need for
      ";proto=" for the STUN URI cannot be sufficiently explained and
      supporting it would render an incomplete specification.  This
      would also result in lost symmetry between the TURN and STUN URIs.
      A more detailed account of the reasoning behind this is available
      at <http://blog.marc.petit-huguenin.org/2012/09/on-design-of-stun-
      and-turn-uri-formats.html>

Internet-Draft                  STUN URI                  September 2013


   o  Following the advice of Section 2.2 of [RFC4395], and because the
      STUN URI does not describe a hierarchical structure, the STUN URIs
      are opaque.
