This document presents how the ISSN - International Standard Serial
Number - which is a persistent number for unique identification of
serials widely recognised and used in the bibliographic world, can be
supported within the Uniform Resource Name (URN) framework as a
specific URN namespace identifier.
 
An ISSN URN resolution system using the ISSN identifier as Uniform
resource Name within an ISN URN Namespace has been developed by the
ISSN International Centre (ISSN-IC) and is operating as a demonstrator
to evaluate all requirements to deploy it in an operational
environment.
 
This proceeds from concepts and proposals developed in several IETF
RFCs emphasising the way to implement and to use "recognised" existing
numbering system within the URN framework (RFC 2248, RFC 2141, RFC
2611).
