The Connection-less Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (CLDAP)
technical specification, RFC 1798, was published in 1995 as a Proposed
Standard.  This document discusses the reasons why the CLDAP technical
specification has not been furthered on the Standard Track.  This
document recommends that RFC 1798 be moved to Historic status.
