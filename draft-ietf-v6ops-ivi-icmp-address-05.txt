          Stateless Source Address Mapping for ICMPv6 Packets
                  draft-ietf-v6ops-ivi-icmp-address-05

Abstract

   A stateless IPv4/IPv6 translator may receive ICMPv6 packets
   containing non IPv4-translatable addresses as the source.  These
   packets should be passed across the translator as ICMP packets
   directed to the IPv4 destination.  This document presents
   recommendations for source address translation in ICMPv6 headers to
   handle such cases.

Internet-Draft      Source Address Mapping for ICMPv6     September 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC6145] section 5.2 of the "IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm"
   document. states that "the IPv6 addresses in the ICMPv6 header may
   not be IPv4-translatable addresses and there will be no corresponding
   IPv4 addresses representing this IPv6 address.  In this case, the
   translator can do stateful translation.  A mechanism by which the
   translator can instead do stateless translation is left for future
   work."  This document, Stateless Source Address Mapping for ICMPv6
   Packets, provides recommendations for this case.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Problem Statement and Considerations

   When a stateless IPv4/IPv6 translator receives an ICMPv6 message
   [RFC4443] (for example "Packet Too Big") sourced from an non-IPv4-
   translatable IPv6 address, bound for to an IPv4-translatable IPv6
   address, the translator needs to pick a source address with which to
   generate an ICMP message.  For the reasons discussed below, this
   choice is problematic.

3.1.  Considerations

   The source address used, should not cause the ICMP packet to be a
   candidate for discarding.  The possibility of uRPF filters in the
   path are a critical consideration [RFC3704] which precludes the use
   of private IPv4 address space [RFC1918] in this context.

   IPv4/IPv6 translation is intended for use in contexts where IPv4
   addresses may not be readily available, so it is not considered
   appropriate to assign IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses for all
   internal points in the IPv6 network that may originate ICMPv6
   messages.

   Another consideration for source selection is that it be possible for
   the IPv4 recipients of the ICMP message to be able to distinguish
   between different IPv6 network origination of ICMPv6 messages, (for
   example, to support a traceroute diagnostic utility that provides
   some limited network level visibility across the IPv4/IPv6
   translator).  This consideration implies that an IPv4/IPv6 translator
   needs to have a pool of IPv4 addresses for mapping the source address

   of ICMPv6 packets generated from different origins, or to include the
   IPv6 source address information for mapping the source address by
   others means.  Currently, the TRACEROUTE and MTR [MTR] are the only
   consumers of translated ICMPv6 messages that care about the ICMPv6
   source address.

3.2.  Recommendations

   The recommended approach to source selection is to use the a single
   (or small pool) of public IPv4 address as the source address of the
   translated ICMP message and leverage ICMP extension [RFC5837] to
   include IPv6 address as an Interface IP Address Sub-Object.


4.  ICMP Extension

   In the case of either a single public IPv4 address (the IPv4
   interface address or loopback address of the translator) or a pool of
   public IPv4 addresses, the translator SHOULD implement ICMP extension
   defined by [RFC5837].  The ICMP message SHOULD include the Interface
   IP Address Sub-Object, and specify the source IPv6 addresses of the
   original ICMPv6.  When an enhanced traceroute application is used, it
   can derive the real IPv6 source addresses which generated the ICMPv6
   messages.  Therefore, it would be able improve on visibility towards
   the origin rather than simply blackholing at or beyond the
   translator.  In the future, a new ICMP extension whose presence
   indicates that the packet has been translated and that the source
   address belongs to the translator, not the originating node can also
   be considered.


5.  Stateless Address Mapping Algorithm

   If a pool of public IPv4 addresses is configured on the translator,
   it is RECOMMENDED to randomly select the IPv4 source address from the
   pool.  This can somehow avoid the appearance of a routing loop in
   tools unaware of the ICMP extension such as traceroute, even though
   those addresses do not really show the actual topology apart from the
   hop count.  An enhanced traceroute application is RECOMMENDED in
   order to obtain the IPv6 source addresses which generated the ICMPv6
   messages.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document recommends the generation of IPv4 ICMP messages from
   IPv6 ICMP messages.  These messages would otherwise have been
   discarded.  It is not expected that new considerations result from

   this change.  As with a number of ICMP messages, a spoofed source
   address may result in replies arriving at hosts that did not expect
   them using the facility of the translator.


7.  IANA Considerations

   There is no consideration requested of IANA.
