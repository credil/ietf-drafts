Abstract

   This document describes a method to improve the bandwidth utilization
   of network paths that carry multiple streams in parallel between two
   endpoints, as in voice trunking.  The method combines standard
   protocols that provide compression, multiplexing, and tunneling over
   a network path for the purpose of reducing the bandwidth used when
   multiple streams are carried over that path.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a way to combine existing protocols for
   compression, multiplexing, and tunneling to save bandwidth for some
   applications that generate small packets, such as real-time ones.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Bandwidth efficiency of real-time flows

   In the last years we are witnessing the raise of new real-time
   services that use the Internet for the delivery of interactive
   multimedia applications.  The most common of these services is VoIP,
   but many others have been developed, and are experiencing a
   significant growth: videoconferencing, telemedicine, video vigilance,
   online gaming, etc.

   The first design of the Internet did not include any mechanism
   capable of guaranteeing an upper bound for delivery delay, taking
   into account that the first deployed services were e-mail, file
   transfer, etc., in which delay is not critical.  RTP [RTP] was first
   defined in 1996 in order to permit the delivery of real-time
   contents.  Nowadays, although there are a variety of protocols used
   for signaling real-time flows (SIP [SIP], H.323, etc.), RTP has
   become the standard par excellence for the delivery of real-time
   content.

   RTP was designed to work over UDP datagrams.  This implies that an
   IPv4 packet carrying real-time information has to include 40 bytes of
   headers: 20 for IPv4 header, 8 for UDP, and 12 for RTP.  This
   overhead is significant, taking into account that many real-time
   services send very small payloads.  It becomes even more significant
   with IPv6 packets, as the basic IPv6 header is twice the size of the
   IPv4 header (Table 1).

   +---------------------------------+---------------------------------+

   +---------------------------------+---------------------------------+

               Table 1: Efficiency of different voice codecs

   In order to mitigate this bad network efficiency, the multiplexing of
   a number of payloads into a single packet can be considered as a
   solution.  If we have only one flow, the number of samples included
   in a packet can be increased, but at the cost of adding new
   packetization delays.  However, if a number of flows share the same
   path between an origin and a destination, a multiplexer can build a
   bigger packet in which a number of payloads share a common header.  A
   demultiplexer is necessary at the end of the common path, so as to
   rebuild the packets as they were originally sent, making multiplexing
   a transparent process for the extremes of the flow.

   The headers of the original packets can be compressed to save more
   bandwidth, taking into account that there exist some header
   compressing standards ([cRTP], [ECRTP], [IPHC], [ROHC]).  When
   different headers are compressed together, tunneling can be used to
   relieve intermediate routers from the decompression and compression
   processing.

1.3.  Real-time applications not using RTP

   But there are many real-time applications that do not use RTP.  Some
   of them send UDP packets, e.g.  First Person Shooter (FPS) online
   games, for which latency is very critical.  There is also another
   fact which has to be taken into account: TCP is getting used for
   media delivery.  For many reasons, such as avoiding firewalls, the
   standard RTP/UDP/IP protocol stack is substituted in many cases by
   FLV/HTTP/TCP/IP (FLash Video [FLV]).

   There is also another kind of applications which have been reported
   as real-time using TCP: MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role
   Playing Games), which in some cases have millions of players,
   thousands of them sharing the same virtual world.  They use TCP
   packets to send the player commands to the server, and also to send
   to the player's application the characteristics and situation of
   other gamers' avatars.  These games do not have the same
   interactivity of FPSs, but the quickness and the movements of the

   player are important, and can decide if they win or lose a fight.

1.4.  Scenarios of application

   Different scenarios of application can be considered for the
   tunneling, compressing and multiplexing solution: for example, voice
   trunking between gateways of different offices of an enterprise.
   Also, the traffic of the users of an application in a town or a
   district, which can be multiplexed and sent to the central server.
   Also Internet cafes are suitable of having many users of the same
   application (e.g. a game) sharing the same access link.

   Another interesting scenario are satellite communication links that
   often manage the bandwidth by limiting the transmission rate,
   measured in packets per second (pps), to and from the satellite.
   Applications like VoIP that generate a large number of small packets
   can easily fill the limited number of pps slots, limiting the
   throughput across such links.  As an example, a G.729a voice call
   generates 50 pps at 20 ms packetization time.  If the satellite
   transmission allows 1,500 pps, the number of simultaneous voice calls
   is limited to 30.  This results in poor utilization of the satellite
   link's bandwidth as well as places a low bound on the number of voice
   calls that can utilize the link simultaneously.  Multiplexing small
   packets into one packet for transmission would improve the
   efficiency.  Satellite links would also find it useful to multiplex
   small TCP packets into one packet.  This could be especially
   interesting for compressing TCP ACKs.

   There is still another interesting use case: desktop or application
   sharing where the traffic from the server to the client typically
   consists of the delta of screen updates.  Also, the standard for
   remote desktop sharing emerging for WebRTC in the RTCWEB Working
   Group is: {something}/SCTP/UDP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol
   [SCTP]).  In this scenario, SCTP/UDP could be used in other cases:
   chatting, file sharing and applications related to WebRTC peers.
   There could be hundreds of clients at a site talking to a server
   located at a datacenter over a WAN.  Compressing, multiplexing and
   tunneling this traffic could save WAN bandwidth and potentially
   improve latency.

1.5.  Objective of this standard

   In conclusion, a standard that multiplexes, compresses and sends
   packets using a tunnel can be interesting for many enterprises:
   developers of VoIP systems can include this option in their
   solutions; or game providers, who can achieve bandwidth savings in
   their supporting infrastructures.  Other fact that has to be taken
   into account is that the technique not only saves bandwidth but also

   reduces the number of packets per second, which sometimes can be a
   bottleneck for a satellite link or even for a network router.

   If only one stream is tunneled and compressed, then little bandwidth
   savings will be obtained.  In contrast, multiplexing is helpful to
   amortize the overhead of the tunnel header over many payloads.

1.6.  Overview of Protocols

   The current standard [TCRTP] defines a way to combine different
   standard protocols.  Three layers are considered, as shown in the
   figure:


                 RTP/UDP
                    |
                    |         ----------------------------
                    |
                  ECRTP             compressing layer
                    |
                    |         ----------------------------
                    |
                  PPPMUX            multiplexing layer
                    |
                    |         ----------------------------
                    |
                  L2TP              tunneling layer
                    |
                    |         ----------------------------
                    |
                   IP

                                 Figure 1

   In contrast, the new proposal includes other protocols to be
   compressed in addition to RTP/UDP, since real-time services can also
   be provided using UDP or TCP.

                                 Figure 2

   Each of the three layers is considered as independent of the other
   two, i.e. different combinations of protocols can be implemented
   according to the new standard:

   o  Regarding compression, a number of options can be considered: as
      the standards are able to compress different headers, the one to
      be used could be selected depending on the traffic to compress.
      It also exists the possibility of having a null header
      compression, in the case of wanting to avoid traffic compression,
      taking into account the need of storing a context for every flow
      and the problems of context desynchronization in certain
      scenarios.  For this, different header compression protocols have
      been defined ([cRTP], [ECRTP], [IPHC], [ROHC]) by the IETF.

   o  Multiplexing is accomplished using PPP Multiplexing [PPP-MUX].
      Nevertheless, other multiplexing protocols can also be considered.

   o  Tunneling is accomplished by using L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling
      Protocol [L2TPv3]), GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation [GRE]) or
      other schemes.

   Finally, another option has been considered: A payload compression
   layer.  When the payload is G.711 this layer can runs G.711.0, a

   lossless and stateless compression/decompression of the payload
   [I.711].  This operations can be deployed by network elements like
   routers/switches, without the endpoints having to signal it using
   RTSP/SDP/SIP, since G.711 has a fixed RTP payload number.


2.  Protocol Operation

   This section describes how to combine three protocols: compressing,
   multiplexing, and tunneling, to save bandwidth for real-time
   applications.

2.1.  Models of implementation

   TCMTF can be implemented in different ways.  The most straightforward
   is to implement it in the devices terminating the real-time streams
   (these devices can be e.g. voice gateways, or proxies grouping a
   number of flows):


          [ending device]---[ending device]
                          ^
                          |
                     TCMTF over IP

                                 Figure 3

   Another way TCMTF can be implemented is with an external
   concentration device.  This device could be placed at strategic
   places in the network and could dynamically create and destroy TCMTF
   sessions without the participation of the endpoints that generate
   real-time flows.


     [ending device]\                                   /[ending device]
     [ending device]---[concentrator]---[concentrator]---[ending device]
     [ending device]/                                   \[ending device]
                     ^                ^                ^
                     |                |                |
                  Native IP      TCMTF over IP      Native IP


                                 Figure 4

   Such a design also allows classical compressing protocols to be used
   on links with only a few active flows per link.

                                 Figure 5

2.2.  Choice of the compressing protocol

   There are different protocols that can be used for compressing real-
   time flows:

   o  IPHC (IP Header Compression [IPHC]) permits the compression of
      TCP/IP, UDP/IP and ESP/IP headers (Encapsulating Security Payload
      [ESP]).  It has a low implementation complexity.  On the other
      hand, the resynchronization of the context can be slow over long
      RTT links.  It should be used in scenarios presenting very low
      packet loss percentage.

   o  cRTP (compressed RTP [cRTP]) works the same way as IPHC, but is
      also able to compress RTP headers.  The link layer transport is
      not specified, but typically PPP is used.  For cRTP to compress
      headers, it must be implemented on each PPP link.  A lot of
      context is required to successfully run cRTP, and memory and
      processing requirements are high, especially if multiple hops must
      implement cRTP to save bandwidth on each of the hops.  At higher
      line rates, cRTP's processor consumption becomes prohibitively
      expensive. cRTP is not suitable over long-delay WAN links commonly
      used when tunneling, as proposed by this document.  To avoid the
      per-hop expense of cRTP, a simplistic solution is to use cRTP with
      L2TP to achieve end-to-end cRTP.  However, cRTP is only suitable
      for links with low delay and low loss.  However, once multiple
      router hops are involved, cRTP's expectation of low delay and low
      loss can no longer be met.  Further, packets can arrive out of
      order.

   o  ECRTP (Enhanced Compressed RTP [ECRTP]) is an extension of cRTP
      [cRTP] that provides tolerance to packet loss and packet
      reordering between compressor and decompressor.  Thus, ECRTP
      should be used instead of cRTP.

   o  ROHC (RObust Header Compression [ROHC]) is able to compress
      TCP/IP, UDP/IP, ESP/IP and RTP/UDP/IP headers.  It is a robust
      scheme developed for header compression over links with high bit
      error rate, such as wireless ones.  It incorporates mechanisms for

      quick resynchronization of the context.  It includes an improved
      encoding scheme for compressing the header fields that change
      dynamically.  Its main drawback is that it requires significantly
      more processing and memory resources than the ones necessary for
      IPHC or ECRTP.

   This standard does not determine which of the existing protocols has
   to be used for the compressing layer.  The decision will depend on
   the scenario, and will mainly be determined by the packet loss
   probability, RTT, and the availability of memory and processing
   resources.  The standard is also suitable to include other
   compressing schemes that may be further developed.

2.2.1.  Context Synchronization in ECRTP

   When the compressor receives an RTP packet that has an unpredicted
   change in the RTP header, the compressor should send a COMPRESSED_UDP
   packet (described in [ECRTP]) to synchronize the ECRTP decompressor
   state.  The COMPRESSED_UDP packet updates the RTP context in the
   decompressor.

   To ensure delivery of updates of context variables, COMPRESSED_UDP
   packets should be delivered using the robust operation described in
   [ECRTP].

   Because the "twice" algorithm described in [ECRTP] relies on UDP
   checksums, the IP stack on the RTP transmitter should transmit UDP
   checksums.  If UDP checksums are not used, the ECRTP compressor
   should use the cRTP Headers checksum described in [ECRTP].

2.2.2.  Context Synchronization in ROHC

   ROHC [ROHC] includes a more complex mechanism in order to maintain
   context synchronization.  It has different operation modes and
   defines compressor states which change depending on link behavior.

2.3.  Multiplexing

   Header compressing algorithms require a layer two protocol that
   allows identifying different protocols.  PPP [PPP] is suited for
   this, although other multiplexing protocols can also be used for this
   layer of TCMTF.

   When header compression is used inside of a tunnel, it will reduce
   the size of the IP, UDP, and IP headers of the IP packet carried in
   the tunnel.  However, the tunnel itself has overhead due to its IP
   header and the tunnel header (the information necessary to identify
   the tunneled payload).  One way to reduce the overhead of the IP

   header and tunnel header is to multiplex multiple real-time payloads
   in a single tunneled packet.

2.3.1.  Tunneling Inefficiencies

   To get reasonable bandwidth efficiency using multiplexing within an
   L2TP tunnel, multiple real-time streams should be active between the
   source and destination of an L2TP tunnel.  The packet size of the
   real-time streams has to be small in order to permit a good bandwidth
   saving.

   If the source and destination of the L2TP tunnel are the same as the
   source and destination of the compressing protocol sessions, then the
   source and destination must have multiple active real-time streams to
   get any benefit from multiplexing.

   Because of this limitation, TCMTF is mostly useful for applications
   where many real-time sessions run between a pair of endpoints.  The
   number of simultaneous sessions required to reduce the header
   overhead to the desired level depends on the size of the L2TP header.
   A smaller L2TP header will result in fewer simultaneous sessions
   being required to produce adequate bandwidth efficiencies.

2.4.  Tunneling

   L2TP tunnels should be used to tunnel the ECRTP payloads end to end.
   L2TP includes methods for tunneling messages used in PPP session
   establishment, such as NCP (Network Control Protocol).  This allows
   [IPCP-HC] to negotiate ECRTP compression/decompression parameters.

   Other tunneling schemes, such as GRE [GRE] may also be used to
   implement the tunneling layer of TCMTF.

2.5.  Encapsulation Formats

   The packet format for a packet compressed is:

   The combined format used for TCMTF with a single payload is all of
   the above packets concatenated.  Here is an example with one payload:

           | IP   |Tunnel| Mux   |P L|      |       |        |    |

           |      |      | Field |          | Field1|        |    |
           |      |      | (1)   |1-2 octets| (0-2) |        |    |
           +------+------+-------+----------+-------+--------+----+
                  |<------------- IP payload -------------------->|
                                 |<-------- Mux payload --------->|

                                 Figure 8

   If the tunnel contains multiplexed traffic, multiple "PPPMux
   payload"s are transmitted in one IP packet.
