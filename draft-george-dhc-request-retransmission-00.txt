Abstract

   The DHCP client sends SOLICIT message to get IP address from the
   server.  If the address pool is empty, all address in the pool have
   allocated to the clients, the server will return error code.
   NoAddrsAvail (server has no address available to assign in the IA).
   Client retransmit the SOLICIT message (section 14 RFC 3315) and may
   get the same response.

   This draft defines a new suboption for the Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) to identify the retry time to sent next SOLICIT
   message.  Hence, avoid unnecessary retransmit of SOLICIT messages.
   The suboption carries a value that identifies when an address will be
   available in the address pool.

1.  Introduction

   To avoid the retry after getting a NoAddrAvail status message from
   the server, add a new DHCP option, retry-after.  The server may
   return retry-after message with a value that is the time when an IP
   address is available in the server address pool.(it can be calculated
   as MIN(t3-current time) for all the client got address from the
   server.  Client may avoid retry till retry-after value, if
   NoAddrsAvail received..

                         expressed in hundredths of a second
                         (10^-2 seconds).
