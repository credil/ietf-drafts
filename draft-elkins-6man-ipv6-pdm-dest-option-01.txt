       IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option
               draft-elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-01


Abstract

   To diagnose problems for a number of Enterprise Data Center Operators
   (EDCO), two metrics are critical for timely end-to-end problem
   resolution, both real-time and after the fact, without impacting an
   operational production network. They are: packet sequence number and
   packet timestamp. Packet sequence number is required for diagnostics.
   Packet timestamp is required to calculate end-to-end response time. 
   Current methods are inadequate for these purposes because they assume
   unreasonable access to intermediate devices, are cost prohibitive,
   require infeasible changes to a running production network, and / or
   do not provide timely data. This document solves these problems with
   a new destination option, the Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   destination option (PDM).

1  Introduction

   To diagnose problems for a number of Enterprise Data Center Operators
   (EDCO), two metrics are critical for timely end-to-end problem
   resolution, both real-time and after the fact, without impacting an
   operational production network. They are: packet sequence number and
   packet timestamp. Packet sequence number is required for diagnostics.
   Packet timestamp is required to calculate end-to-end response time.

   For background, please see Draft-Elkins-Packet-Sequence-Number-
   Needed-00 [PSNELK], Draft-Elkins-End-To-End-Response-Time-00
   [RSPELK], and Draft-Elkins-PDM-Recommended-Usage-00 [USEELK]. These
   drafts are companion documents to this document.  All three documents
   should be read together. 

   As discussed in the above Internet Drafts, current methods are
   inadequate for these purposes because they assume unreasonable access
   to intermediate devices, are cost prohibitive, require infeasible
   changes to a running production network, and / or do not provide
   timely data.   This document provides a solution for these problems.

   As defined in RFC2460 [RFC2460], destination options are carried by
   the IPv6 Destination Options extension header.  Destination options
   include optional information that need be examined only by the IPv6
   node given as the destination address in the IPv6 header, not by
   routers in between.  This document detail the specifications for a
   new destination option, the Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   destination option (PDM).

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2  Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option

2.1  Destination Options Header

   The IPv6 Destination Options Header is used to carry optional
   information that need be examined only by a packet's destination
   node(s). The Destination Options Header is identified by a Next
   Header value of 60 in the immediately preceding header and is defined
   in RFC2460 [RFC2460].

2.2  Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option 

   The IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option (PDM)
   is an implementation of the Destination Options Header (Next Header
   value = 60). 

   It is used to facilitate diagnostics by including a packet sequence
   number and timestamp. 

   The PDM destination option is encoded in type-length-value (TLV)
   format as follows:


   0                   1                   2                   3

   Option Length

   8-bit unsigned integer. Length of the option, in octets, excluding
   the Option Type and Option Length fields. This field MUST be set to
   88.


   Packet Sequence Number

   16-bit unsigned integer.  This field will wrap. It is intended for
   human use.

   Initialized at 0 and monotonically incremented for protocol packet on
   the CONNECTION. 

   Operating systems MUST implement a separate packet sequence number
   counter per connection. Operating systems MUST NOT implement a single
   counter for all connections.  

   Note: This is consistent with the current implementation of the IPID
   field in IPv4 for many, but not all, stacks.


   TimeStamp This Packet

   A 64-bit unsigned integer field containing a timestamp that this
   packet was sent by the source node.  The value indicates the number
   of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00 UTC, by using a fixed point
   format.  In this format, the integer number of seconds is contained
   in the first 32 bits of the field, and the remaining 32 bits resolve
   to picoseconds.

   This follows timestamp formats used in Network Time Protocol (NTP)
   [RFC5905] and SEND [RFC3971]. A discussion of why NTP is used in
   preference to Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is in Draft-Elkins-End-
   To-End-Response-Time-00.txt.

   Implementation note: This format is compatible with the usual
   representation of time under UNIX, although the number of bits
   available for the integer and fraction parts in different Unix
   implementations vary.


   TimeStamp Last Packet

   A 64-bit unsigned integer field containing a timestamp that the last
   packet on this connection was received. The value indicates the
   number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00 UTC, by using a fixed

   point format.  In this format, the integer number of seconds is
   contained in the first 32 bits of the field, and the remaining 32
   bits resolve to picoseconds.

   This follows timestamp formats used in Network Time Protocol (NTP)
   [RFC5905] and SEND [RFC3971]. 


   Application Reserved

   A 64-bit field reserved for performance and diagnostic metrics to be
   used by end nodes.  The meaning is agreed upon by the source and
   destination nodes.



   Option Type

   The two highest-order bits of the Option Type field are encoded to
   indicate specific processing of the option; for the PDM destination
   option, these two bits MUST be set to 00. This indicates the
   following processing requirements:

     00 - skip over this option and continue processing the header.

   RFC2460 [RFC2460] defines other values for the Option Type field. 
   These MUST NOT be used in the PDM.  The other values are as follows:

         01 - discard the packet.

         10 - discard the packet and, regardless of whether or not the
   packet's Destination Address was a multicast address, send an ICMP
   Parameter Problem, Code 2, message to the packet's Source Address,
   pointing to the unrecognized Option Type.

         11 - discard the packet and, only if the packet's Destination
   Address was not a multicast address, send an ICMP Parameter Problem,
   Code 2, message to the packet's Source Address, pointing to the
   unrecognized Option Type.


   In keeping with RFC2460 [RFC2460], the third-highest-order bit of the
   Option Type specifies whether or not the Option Data of that option
   can change en-route to the packet's final destination. 

   In the PDM, the value of the third-highest-order bit MUST be 0.  The
   possible values are as follows:

INTERNET DRAFT    elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-01           May 2013


         0 - Option Data does not change en-route

         1 - Option Data may change en-route

   The three high-order bits described above are to be treated as part
   of the Option Type, not independent of the Option Type.  That is, a
   particular option is identified by a full 8-bit Option Type, not just
   the low-order 5 bits of an Option Type.


   Header Placement

   The PDM destination option MUST be placed as follows:

      - Before the upper-layer header.  That is, this is the last
   extension header.

   This follows the order defined in RFC2460 [RFC2460] 

              IPv6 header

              Hop-by-Hop Options header

              Destination Options header 

              Routing header

              Fragment header

              Authentication header 

              Encapsulating Security Payload header 

              Destination Options header 

              upper-layer header	

   For each IPv6 packet header, the PDM MUST NOT appear more than once.
   However, an encapsulated packet MAY contain a separate PDM associated
   with each encapsulated IPv6 header.

   The inclusion of a PDM in a packet affects the receiving node's
   processing of only this single packet. No state is created or
   modified in the receiving node as a result of receiving a PDM in a
   packet.

2.3  Implementation Considerations

 


Elkins                  Expires January 15, 2014                [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT    elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-01           May 2013


   The PDM destination options extension header SHOULD be turned on by
   each stack on a host node.

   If implemented, each operating system MUST have a default
   configuration parameter, e.g. diag_header_sys_default_value=yes/no. 
   The operating system MAY also have a dynamic configuration option to
   change the configuration setting as needed. 

   If the PDM destination options extension header is used, then it MAY
   be turned on for all packets flowing through the host, applied to an
   upper-layer protocol (TCP, UDP, SCTP, etc), a local port, or IP
   address only.  These are at the discretion of the implementation.

   The PDM MUST NOT be changed dynamically via packet flow as this may
   create potential security violation or DoS attack by numerous packets
   turning the header on and off.  

   As with all other destination options extension headers, the PDM is
   for destination nodes only. As specified above, intermediate devices
   MUST neither set nor modify this field. 


3  Backward Compatibility

   The scheme proposed in this document is backward compatible with all
   the currently defined IPv6 extension headers. According to RFC2460
   [RFC2460], if the destination node does not recognize this option, it
   should skip over this option and continue processing the header.

4  Security Considerations

   The PDM MUST NOT be changed dynamically via packet flow as this
   creates a possibility for potential security violations or DoS
   attacks by numerous packets turning the header on and off.  


5  IANA Considerations

   An option type must be assigned by IANA for the Performance and
   Diagnostic Metrics destination option.
