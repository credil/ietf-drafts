1. Introduction 

   [RFC 4655] presents the architecture of a Path Computation Element 
   (PCE)-based model for computing Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) 
   and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched 
   Paths (TE LSPs). To perform such a constrained computation, a PCE 
   stores the network topology (i.e., TE links and nodes) and resource 
   information (i.e., TE attributes) in its TE Database (TED). To 
   request path computation services to a PCE, [RFC 5440] defines the 
   PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path 
   Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between two PCEs. PCEP 
   protocol specified in [RFC 5440] mainly focuses on MPLS networks and 
   the PCEP extensions needed for GMPLS-controlled networks are 
   provided in [PCEP-GMPLS].  

   Stateful PCEs are shown to be helpful in many application scenarios, 
   in both MPLS and GMPLS networks, as illustrated in [Stateful-APP]. 
   In order for these applications to able to exploit the capability of 
   stateful PCEs, extensions to the PCE communication protocol (i.e., 
   PCEP) are required.  

   [Stateful-PCE] provides the fundamental extensions needed for 
   stateful PCE to support general functionality, but leaves out the 
   specification for technology-specific objects/TLVs. Complementarily, 
   this document focuses on the extensions that are necessary in order 
   for its deployment in GMPLS-controlled networks.  

2. PCEP Extensions  

2.1. Overview of Requirements 

   This section notes the main functional requirements for PCEP 
   extensions to support stateful PCE for use in GMPLS networks, based 
   on the description in [Stateful-APP]. Many requirements are common 
   across a variety of network types (e.g., MPLS-TE networks and GMPLS 
   networks) and the protocol extensions to meet the requirements are 
   already described in [Stateful-PCE]. This document does not repeat 
   the description of those protocol extensions. Other requirements 
   that are also common across a variety of network types do not 
   currently have protocol extensions defined in [Stateful-PCE]. In 
   these cases, this document presents protocol extensions for 
   discussion by the PCE working group and potential inclusion in 
   [Stateful-PCE]. In addition, this document presents protocol 
   extensions for a set of requirements which are specific to the use 
   of a stateful PCE in a GMPLS-controlled network. 

   The basic requirements are as follows:

draft-zhang-pce-pcep-stateful-pce-gmpls-02.txt            February 2013 
    

   o Advertisement and negotiation of the stateful PCE capability. This  
     generic requirement is covered in Section 7.1.1 of [Stateful-PCE] 
     Section 2.2 of this document discusses other potential extensions 
     for this functionality. 

   o LSP delegation is already covered in Section 5.5 of [Stateful- 
     PCE]. Section 2.3 of this document provides extension for its 
     application in GMPLS-controlled networks. Moreover, further  
     discussion of some generic details that may need additional 
     consideration is provided. 

   o LSP synchronization (see [Stateful-APP] Section 2.2). This is a 
     generic requirement already covered in Section 5.4 of [Stateful- 
     PCE]. However, there are further extensions required specifically 
     for GMPLS networks and discussed in Section 2.4.o Reference to 
   LSPs by identifiers is discussed in Section 7.2 of  
     [Stateful-PCE].  This feature can be applied to reduce the data 
     carried in PCEP messages. Use cases and additional Error Codes 
     are necessary, as described in Section 2.5 and 2.6. 

2.2. Stateful PCE Capability Advertisement and Negotiation 

   Whether a PCE has stateful capability or not can be negotiated 
   during the PCEP session establishment process. It can also be 
   advertised through routing protocols as described in [RFC5088]. In 
   either case, the following additional aspects should also be 
   considered. 

 2.2.1. PCE Capability Negotiation/Advertisement in Multi-layer Networks 

   In multi-layer network scenarios, such as an IP-over-optical network, 
   if there are dedicated PCEs responsible for each layer, then the 
   PCCs should be informed of which PCEs they should synchronize their 
   LSP states with, as well as send path computation requests to. The 
   Layer-Cap TLV defined in [INTER-LAYER] can be used to indicate which 
   layer a PCE is in charge of. This TLV is optional and MAY be carried 
   in the OPEN object. It is RECOMMMENDED that a PCC synchronizes its 
   LSP states with the same PCEs that it can use for path computation 
   in a multi-layer network. In a single layer, this TLV MAY not be 
   used. However, if the PCE capability discovery depends on IGP and if 
   an IGP instance spans across multiple layers, this TLV is still 
   needed.  

   Alternatively, the extension to current OSPF PCED TLV is needed. A 
   new domain-type denoting the layer information can be defined: 

   domain-type: T.B.D.

draft-zhang-pce-pcep-stateful-pce-gmpls-02.txt            February 2013 
    

   When it is carried in PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV, it denotes the layer for 
   which a PCE is responsible for path computation as well as LSP state 
   synchronization. When carried in the PCE-NEIG-DOMAIN sub-TLV, it 
   denotes its adjacent layers for which a PCE can compute paths and 
   synchronize the LSP states. The DOMAIN-ID information can be 
   represented using the following format, to denote the layer 
   information:  

    0                   1                   2                   3  
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1      
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
   | LSP Enc. Type | Switching Type|             Reserved          |           
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
 
 
2.3. LSP Delegation in GMPLS Networks  

   To enable the PCE to control an LSP, the PCUpd message is defined in 
   [Stateful-PCE]. However, technology-specific specification is not 
   covered. The following defines the <path> descriptor that should be 
   used in GMPLS networks: 

   <path>::=<ERO><attribute-list> 

      Where:  

         <attribute-list> ::= [<LSPA>] 

                              [<BANDWIDTH>] 

                              [<GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH>...]    

                              [<metric-list>] 

         <metric-list>::= <METRIC>[<metric-list>] 

   The O bit in the <GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH> object has no meaning for 
   LSP state synchronization and MUST be set to 0. Furthermore, this 
   object MAY appear twice, one with R set to 1 and the other with R 
   set to 0. This is to denote the asymmetric bandwidth property of the 
   updated bi-directional LSP. 

   As explained in [stateful-APP], LSP state synchronization and/or LSP 
   parameter change controlled by a stateful PCE in a multi-domain 
   network is complex and requires well-defined operational procedures 
   as well as protocol design.

   [TBD: protocol extensions] 

2.4. LSP Synchronization in GMPLS networks 

   For LSP state synchronization of stateful PCEs in GMPLS networks, 
   the LSP attributes, such as its bandwidth, associated route as well 
   as protection information etc, should be updated by PCCs to PCE LSP 
   database (LSP-DB). Note the LSP state synchronization described in 
   this document denotes both the bulk LSP report at the initialization 
   phase as well as the LSP state report afterwards described in 
   [Stateful-PCE]. 

   As per [Stateful-PCE], it does not cover technology-specific 
   specification for state synchronization. Therefore, extensions of 
   PCEP protocol for stateful PCE usage in GMPLS networks are required. 
   For LSP state synchronization, the objects/TLVs that should be used 
   for stateful PCE in GMPLS networks are defined in [PCEP-GMPLS] and 
   are briefly summarized as below:  

   o GENERALIZED BANDWIDTH 

   o GENERALIZED ENDPOINTS 

   o PROTECTION ATTRIBUTE  

   o Use of IF_ID_ERROR_SPEC. [Stateful-PCE] section 7.2.2 only 
   considers  RSVP ERROR_SPEC TLVs. GMPLS extends this to also support 
   IF_ID_ERROR_SPEC, for example, to report about failed unnumbered 
   interfaces. 

   o Extended Objects to support the inclusion of the label and 
   unnumbered links.  

   Per [Stateful-PCE], the PCRpt message is defined for LSP state 
   synchronization purpose. PCRpt is used by a PCC to report one or 
   more of its LSPs to a stateful PCE. However, the <path> descriptor 
   is technology-specific and left undefined.   

   For LSP state synchronization in GMPLS networks, the encoding of the 
   <path> descriptor is defined as follows: 

   <path>::=<ERO><attribute-list> 

      Where:  

         <attribute-list> ::= [<LSPA>] 

                              [<BANDWIDTH>]

                              [<GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH>...] 

                              [<RRO>] 

                              [<IRO>] 

                              [<XRO>] 

                              [<metric-list>] 

         <metric-list>::= <METRIC>[<metric-list>] 

   The objects included in the <path> descriptor can be found in 
   [RFC5440], [PCE-GMPLS] and [RFC5521]. 

   For all the objects presented in this section, the P and I bit MUST 
   be set to 0 since they are only used by a PCC to report its LSP 
   information. 

   In GMPLS networks, the <ERO> object may include a list of the label 
   sub-object for SDH/SONET, OTN and DWDM networks. It may also include 
   a list of unnumbered interface IDs to denote the allocated resource. 
   The <RRO>, <IRO> and <XRO> objects MAY include unnumbered interface 
   IDs and labels for networks such as OTN and WDM networks. 

   If the LSP being reported is a protecting LSP, the <PROTECTION-
   ATTRIBUTE> TLV MUST be included in the <LSPA> object to denote its 
   attributes and restrictions. Moreover, if the status of the 
   protecting LSP changes from non-operational to operational, this 
   should be synchronized to the stateful PCE. For example, in 1:1 
   protection, the combination of S=0, P=1 and O=0 denotes the 
   protecting path is set up already but not used for carrying traffic. 
   Upon the working path failure, the operational status of the 
   aforementioned protecting LSP changes to in-use (i.e., O=1). This 
   information should be synchronized with a stateul PCE through a 
   PCRpt message. 

   The O bit in the <GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH> object has no meaning for 
   LSP state synchronization and MUST be set to 0. Furthermore, this 
   object MAY appear twice, one with R set to 1 and the other with R 
   set to 0. This is to denote the asymmetric bandwidth property of the 
   updated bi-directional LSP.

2.5.  Modification of Existing PCEP Messages and Procedures  

   One of the advantages mentioned in [Stateful-APP] is that the 
   stateful nature of a PCE simplifies the information conveyed in PCEP 
   messages, notably between PCC and PCE, since it is possible to refer 
   to PCE managed state for active LSPs. To be more specific, with a 
   stateful PCE, it is possible to refer to a LSP with an unique 
   identifier in the scope of the PCC-PCEP session and thus use such 
   identifier to refer to that LSP.  

 2.5.1. Use cases 

   Use Case 1: Assuming a stateful PCE's LSP-DB is up-to-date, a PCC 
   (e.g. NMS) requesting for a re-optimization of one or several LSPs 
   can send the request with ''R'' bit set and only provides the relevant 
   LSP unique identifiers. 

   Upon receiving the PCReq message, PCE should be able to correlate 
   with one or multiple LSPs with their detailed state information and 
   carry out optimization accordingly.  

   The handling of RP object specified in [RFC5440] is stated as 
   following: 

   ''The absence of an RRO in the PCReq message for a non-zero-bandwidth 
   TE LSP (when the R bit of the RP object is set) MUST trigger the 
   sending of a PCErr message with Error-Type="Required Object Missing" 
   and Error-value="RRO Object missing for re-optimization." 

   If a PCE has stateful capabilities, and such capabilities have been 
   negotiated and advertised, specific rules given in [RFC5440] may 
   need to be relaxed. In particular, the re-optimization case: if the 
   re-optimization request refers to a given LSP state, and the RRO 
   information is available, the PCE can proceed. 

   Use Case 2: in order to set up a LSP which has a constraint that its 
   route should not use resources used by one or more existing LSPs, a 
   PCC can send a PCReq with the identifiers of these LSPs. A stateful 
   PCE should be able to find the corresponding route and resource 
   information so as to meet the constraints set by the requesting PCC. 
   Hence, the LSP identifier TLV defined in [Stateful-PCE] can be used 
   in XRO object for this purpose. Note that if the PCC is a node in 
   the network, the constraint LSP ID information will be confined to 
   the LSPs initiated by itself.

 2.5.2. Modification for LSP Re-optimization 

   For re-optimization, upon receiving a path computation request and 
   the ''R'' bit is set, the stateful PCE SHOULD still perform the re-
   optimization in the following two cases: 

   Case 1: the existing bandwidth and route information of the to-be-
   optimized LSP is provided in the path computation request. This 
   information should be provided via <BANDWIDTH>, <GENERARLIZED-
   BANDWIDTH>, <ERO> objects. 

   Case 2: the existing bandwidth and route information can be found 
   locally in its LSP-DB. In this case, the PCRep and PCReq messages 
   need to be modified to carry LSP identifiers. The stateful PCE can 
   find this information using the per-node LSP ID together with the 
   PCC's address. 

   If no LSP state information is available to carry out re-
   optimization, the stateful PCE should report the error ''LSP state 
   information unavailable for the LSP re-optimization'' (Error Type = 
   T.B.D., Error value= T.B.D.). 

 2.5.3. Modification for Route Exclusion 

   A LSP identifier sub-object is defined and its format as follows: 

       0                   1                   2                   3

   a strict hop in the explicit route. 
    
      Type: 
        Subobject Type for a per-node LSP identifier.  
          
      Length: 
        The Length contains the total length of the subobject in bytes, 
   including the Type and Length fields.

     LSP ID: 
         This is the identifier given to a LSP and it is unique on a 
   node basis. It is defined in [Stateful-PCE]. 
    
     Flags: 
         This field is defined in [Stateful-PCE]. It is not used in 
   this sub-object and should be ignored upon receipt. 
    
     Optional TLVs: 
         Additional TLVs can be defined in the future to provide 
   further information to identify a LSP. In this document, no TLVs are 
   defined. 
    
   One or multiple of these sub-objects can be present in the XRO 
   object. When a stateful PCE receives a path computation request 
   carrying this sub-object, it should find relevant information of 
   these LSPs and preclude the resource during the path computation 
   process. If a stateful PCE cannot recognize one or more of the 
   received LSP identifiers, it should reply PCErr saying ''the LSP 
   state information for route exclusion purpose cannot be found'' 
   (Error-type = T.B.D., Error-value= T.B.D.). Optionally, it may 
   provide with the unrecognized identifier information to the 
   requesting PCC. 

2.6. Additional Error Type and Error Values Defined 

   Error Type Meaning 

   21(TBD)    LSP state information missing  

               Error-value 1: LSP state information unavailable for the 
               LSP re-optimization 

3. Error-value 2: the LSP state information for route exclusion purpose 
   cannot be found IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to allocate new Types for the TLV/Object defined 
   in this document. 

   T.B.D. 

4. Manageability Considerations 

   The description and functionality specifications presented related 
   to stateful PCEs should also comply with the manageability 
   specifications covered in Section 8 of [RFC4655]. Furthermore, a 
   further list of manageability issues presented in [Stateful-PCE] 
   should also be considered.

   Additional considerations are presented in the next sections. 

4.1. Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components 

   When the detailed route information is included for LSP state 
   synchronization (either at the initial stage or during LSP state 
   report process), this require the ingress node of an LSP carry the 
   RRO object in order to enable the collection of such information.  

5. Security Considerations 

   The security issues presented in [RFC5440] and [Stateful-PCE] apply 
   to this document.  

6. Acknowledgement 

   We would like to thank Adrian Farrel and Cyril Margaria for the 
   useful comments and discussions.
