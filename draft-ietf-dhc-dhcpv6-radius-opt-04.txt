    RADIUS Option for DHCPv6 Relay Agents on Broadband Access Server
                  draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-radius-opt-04

Abstract

   The DHCPv6 RADIUS option provides a mechanism to exchange
   authorization and identification information between relay agent and
   server.  This mechanism is meant for the centralized DHCPv6 server to
   select the right configuration for the requesting client based on the
   authorization information received from the RADIUS server, which is
   not co-located with the DHCPv6 server.  The NAS acts as DHCPv6 relay
   agent and RADIUS client simultaneously in this document.

Internet-Draft            DHCPv6 RADIUS Option             November 2012


1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 provides a mechanism that allows the server to assign or
   delegate both stateful and stateless configuration parameters to the
   clients.  The stateful configuration parameters include IPv6 address
   [RFC3315], IPv6 prefix [RFC3633], etc.  The stateless configuration
   parameters [RFC3736] include, for example, DNS [RFC3646], or a FQDN
   of AFTR [RFC6334].  In this document, the DHCPv6 server is deployed
   in the central part of an ISP network.

   RADIUS [RFC2865] is widely used as the centralized authentication,
   authorization and user management mechanism for the service provision
   in Broadband access network.  [RFC3162], [RFC4818], [RFC6519] and
   [I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access] specified attributes that support the
   service provision for IPv6-only and IPv6-transition access.  RADIUS
   server authorizes the NAS to assign an IPv6 address or prefix from
   the indicated pool, or to assign an IPv6 address or prefix with an
   explicitly indicated value, and other configuration parameters as per
   the attributes for the subscribers.

   These mechanisms work well in the deployment scenarios where the NAS
   acts as the distributed DHCPv6 server.  In that case the NAS directly
   responds the DHCPv6 messages as per the indication conveyed by the
   attributes in the Access-Accept message from the RADIUS server.
   These mechanisms might also work well in the scenario where the
   centralized DHCPv6 server is co-located with the RADIUS server, where
   they can share the same database of the users.  But when the NAS acts
   as the relay agent and RADIUS client simultaneously, and the
   centralized DHCPv6 server is not located in the same place as the
   RADIUS server, a new communication mechanism is needed for the relay
   agent to transfer the authorization information indicated by the
   RADIUS attributes to the DHCPv6 server.


2.  Terminology and Language

   This document specifies a DHCPv6 option for the distributed Relay
   Agent to transfer the authorization information of RADIUS attributes
   received in the Access-Accept message to the centralized DHCPv6
   server.  Definitions for terms and acronyms not specified in this
   document are defined in [RFC2865] and [RFC3315].

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

3.  Network Scenarios

   Figure 1 and Figure 2 shows the typical network scenarios where the
   communication mechanism introduced in this document is necessary.  In
   these scenarios, the centralized DHCPv6 server is not co-located with
   the RADIUS server, but both of them are in the same administrative
   domain.  The NAS acts as the relay agent and the RADIUS client
   simultaneously.  Figure 1 shows the sequence of DHCPv6 and RADIUS
   messages for IPoE access mode.  Figure 2 shows the sequence of DHCPv6
   and RADIUS messages for PPPoE access mode.

   sequences will stop.  The NAS acting as the DHCPv6 relay agent will
   not forward the message received from the client to the server.

   does not have to initiate a new Access-Request/Access message

Internet-Draft            DHCPv6 RADIUS Option             November 2012


4.  DHCPv6 RADIUS option

   The OPTION_RADIUS is a stateless DHCPv6 option, and is used by the
   relay agent to carry the authorization information of RADIUS
   attributes received in the Access-Accept message.

   The format of the OPTION_RADIUS option is defined as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   option-code      TBD
   option-len       Length of the option-data in Octets
   option-data      List of one or more RADIUS Attributes

   The option-data of OPTION_RADIUS is a list of one or more RADIUS
   attributes received in the Access-Accept message from the RADIUS
   server.  Only the attributes listed in the IANA Registry of 'RADIUS
   Attributes Permitted in the DHCPv6 RADIUS option' Should be included
   in the OPTION_RADIUS.

   The RADIUS attributes listed in the below table are recommended as
   the first batch of attributes in the IANA Registry of 'RADIUS
   Attributes Permitted in the DHCPv6 RADIUS option'.

   Type Code  Attribute                   Reference
   26         Vendor-Specific             [RFC2865]
   123        Delegated-IPv6-Prefix       [RFC4818]
   144        DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name         [RFC6519]
   [TBD]      Framed-IPv6-Address         [I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access]
   [TBD]      Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool  [I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access]
   [TBD]      Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool  [I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access]
   [TBD]      DNS-Server-IPv6-Address     [I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access]

   Note: The definition of the RADIUS attribute's 'Length' field in
   section 5 of [RFC2865] is different from that of DHCPv6 option's
   'option-len' field defined here.


5.  Relay Agent Behavior

   The DHCPv6 relay agent may include OPTION_RADIUS in the RELAY-FORW
   (12) message.  When the value in the attributes of Stateful-IPv6-

Internet-Draft            DHCPv6 RADIUS Option             November 2012


   Address-Pool, Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool, Delegated-IPv6-Prefix (123)
   or Framed-IPv6-Address in the Access-Accept message replied from
   RADIUS server are valid, the relay agent that supports OPTION_RADIUS
   SHOULD include these RADIUS attributes into the container option,
   OPTION_RADIUS.


6.  Server Behavior

   Upon receipt of the RELAY-FORW (12) message with OPTION_RADIUS from a
   relay agent, the DHCPv6 server SHOULD extract and interpret the
   RADIUS attributes in the OPTION_RADIUS, and use that information in
   selecting configuration parameters for the requesting client.  If the
   DHCPv6 server does not support OPTION_RADIUS, the DHCPv6 server MUST
   silently discard this option.


7.  Client Behavior

   OPTION_RADIUS option is only sent from the relay agents to the
   servers.  DHCPv6 clients are not aware of the usage of OPTION_RADIUS.
   DHCPv6 Client MUST NOT send OPTION_RADIUS, and MUST ignore
   OPTION_RADIUS if received.


8.  Security Considerations

   Known security vulnerabilities of the DHCPv6 and RADIUS protocol may
   apply to its options.  Security issues related with DHCPv6 are
   described in section 23 of [RFC3315].  Security issues related with
   RADIUS are described in section 8 of [RFC2865], section 5 of
   [RFC3162].


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests to assign a new DHCPv6 option code for
   OPTION_RADIUS, and to create a new registry on the same assignments
   page, which can be entitled as 'RADIUS Attributes Permitted in the
   DHCPv6 RADIUS option'.  The new registry will enumerate the RADIUS
   Attributes Types
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types/radius-types.xml) that
   are permitted to be included in the DHCPv6 RADIUS option.  The RADIUS
   Attribute may be added to this list after IETF Review [RFC5226].  The
   IETF Review Should include careful consideration of the security
   implications of allowing the relay agent to include the RADIUS
   attribute being considered for addition to this registry.
