                       Tunnel Congestion Exposure
            draft-zhang-tsvwg-tunnel-congestion-exposure-00

Abstract

   At present, tunneling technology has been widely applied in VPN,
   mobile communication network, IPv6 over IPv4, Mobile IP, multi-point
   delivery, and other fields.  In the E2E link, there may already have
   been an effective congestion control mechanism, but we SHOULD also do
   traffic management in the tunnel to improve the performance of the
   entire network.  Because of the particularity of the scenario of the
   tunnel, the existing E2E traffic management mechanism cannot be
   directly be deployed (e.g.  VPN, IPv6 over IPv4 etc).  In these
   cases, this document focuses on how to expose the congestion while
   the feedback mechanism is left for later study.  This document
   describes the problem of identifying congestion in a tunnel segment
   of an end-to-end flow.  A basic tunnel congestion exposure model is
   then described, followed by three example scenarios which use the
   basic model to derive tunnel congestion.  Finally, a general solution
   that can be applied to IP-in-IP tunnels is described.

1.  Introduction

   This document mainly describes four issues.

   Firstly, this document describes the problem concerning congestion in
   the tunnel.  At present, tunneling technology has been widely applied
   in, VPN, mobile communication network, IPv6 over IPv4, Mobile IP,
   multi-point delivery, and other fields.  In this case, relying on
   end-to-end congestion management alone to deal with the congestion
   problem in the tunnel brings many drawbacks and seriously affects the
   performance of the entire network.

   Secondly, this document proposes a basic tunnel congestion exposure
   model.  In the model, the ingress and the egress of the tunnel are
   two dominant nodes which have the ability to handle admission, flow
   control and policy control.

   In the basic model, in order to achieve a real-time understanding of
   the congestion status of the tunnel, the amount of tunnel congestions
   is fed back to the ingress of the tunnel using the tunnel
   encapsulation protocol signals.  It's helpful for the ingress to
   achieve a real-time congestion status of the entire tunnel, and it
   also provides the possibility of using policy or flow control
   mechanisms to further reduce congestion in the local tunnel portion.

   Thirdly, this document introduces three example scenarios where the
   proposed basic model can be applied.

   Finally, this document presents a general solution.  The general
   solution includes a statement of requirements and general procedures.

1.1.  Document Overview

   The main section in this document is the basic model described in
   chapter 4.  A tunnel congestion exposure model is presented in the
   chapter.  The model is relatively simple, but it can be used to
   sufficiently expose the tunnel congestion.  Chapter 3 gives the
   general process of tunnel transmission and presents two major
   problems related to the tunnel congestion.  Three scenarios are given
   in Chapter 5 that use the basic model.  Chapter 6 introduces a
   general solution.  Chapter 7 states a further study plan.

3.  Problem Statement

   Tunneling technology is one way to transmit data between different
   networks by using the Internet infrastructure.  The tunnel can
   transmit the frames or packets of different protocols as its payload.
   The frames or packets are re-encapsulated using new headers of the
   tunneling protocol.  The new header provides the routing information
   so that the encapsulated payload data can be transmitted through the
   public Internet.  As soon as being transmitted to the endpoint of
   network (egress), the data will be de-encapsulated and forwarded to
   its final destination.

   In the IP network, there are three typical encapsulation protocols:
   IP Encapsulation within IP [RFC2003]; Minimal Encapsulation within IP
   [RFC2004]; Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) [RFC1701].

   As an example, the format of GRE encapsulation is shown in Figure 1.

                         +------------------------+
                         |           IP           |
                         |   (payload Protocol)   |
                         +------------------------+
                         |          GRE           |
                         |(Encapsulation Protocol)|
                         +------------------------+
                         |           IP           |
                         |  (Transport Protocol)  |
                         +------------------------+


                    Figure 1: GRE encapsulation format

   At present, tunneling technology is widely used in computer networks.
   It MAY be used to transport IPv4 in IPv6 networks and vice versa
   during the two protocols coexistence period.  In Mobile IP, by
   introducing tunnels, a mobile node can communicate with its
   correspondent node using a fixed address (home address) at any time
   and place.  In addition, tunneling technology has also played an
   important role in virtual private network (VPN), multi-point
   delivery, and mobile communication networks.

   We perceive two problems related to congestion and tunneling
   technology in IP and mobile communication networks.

   Consider the following situation: data packets need to be transmitted
   end-to-end over an ECN-enabled transport and part of this includes a
   tunnel segment.




Zhu, et al.              Expires April 18, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Tunnel Congestion Exposure           October 2012


   The ingress, the egress and the intermediate nodes of the tunnel are
   ECN-enabled.  At the egress of the tunnel, the data packets are de-
   capsulated, peeled off the transport protocol in outer header, and
   then the inner packets are forwarded to the destination endpoint.

   In this case, it is useful to specify the behaviors of the
   encapsulation and de-capsulation; otherwise the following problems
   may occur:

   o  The packet congestion inside the tunnel cannot be indicated;

   o  E2E path congestion information may be lost.

   For these two problems, RFC3168, RFC4301 and RFC6040 have presented
   some descriptions and specifications to all IP in IP tunnels.

   The core idea is:

   o  Set the ECN bits as ECT(0)/ECT(1) at the ingress in order to
      inform the interior router to perform mark operations and indicate
      congestion events inside the tunnel;

   o  Perform "copy-to-copy" operations at the ingress and egress of the
      tunnel, so that the congestion information of the arriving packet
      or inside the tunnel can be forwarded to the final endpoint
      instead of being lost.

   In the mobile communication network, end-user IP traffic maybe
   forwarded over multiple tunnel segments before it reaches the router
   that handles subscriber policy, charging etc.  Congestion over these
   tunnel segments contribute to the overall congestion experienced E2E.

   In the tunnel protocol deployment scenarios, we may use other
   methods, for example, out of-band signaling, to report the congestion
   information to NE (Network Element) which has the mechanisms to
   manage congestion based on per user policies or other flow control
   mechanisms.

   However, tunnel congestion information should not be overlooked.  In
   the E2E link, there may already have been an effective congestion
   control mechanism, but we SHOULD also do traffic management in the
   tunnel to improve the performance of the entire network.  Because of
   the particularity of the scenario of the tunnel, the existing E2E
   traffic management mechanism cannot be directly be deployed (e.g.
   VPN, IPv6 over IPv4 etc).  In these cases, this document focuses on
   how to expose the congestion while the feedback mechanism is left for
   later study.

   The following assumptions are made in this document:

   o  Firstly, both payload and transport protocols are IP in this
      document, i.e., we consider only IP-in-IP tunnels;

   o  Secondly, the intermediate nodes within the tunnels, for example,
      the routers are ECN-enabled;

   o  Finally, no changes are made to the ECN mechanism.


4.  Basic Model

   According to the general tunnel transmission process, this section
   introduces the abstract of the tunnel transmission and outlines a
   tunnel congestion exposure model as shown in Figure 2:

   This basic model MAY contain the following components: Ingress,
   Egress, Collector, Feedback and Meter.

   By and large, the ingress and egress of the tunnel are gateway
   devices.  In terms of the egress, it can calculate the amount of
   congestion and feed back the congestion information to the ingress.
   The collector is able to receive the congestion information which is

   fed back from the egress.  It MAY also have admission control and
   flow control functions.

   General practice can be as follows:

   At the egress, a module named meter can be added.  The module records
   the outer header CE codepoint packets reaches the egress
   independently, and MAY need to estimate the congestion level inside
   the tunnel.  In addition, a congestion information feedback module,
   called feedback, is also needed to be added.  The feedback module is
   used to control the congestion information feedback.  The feedback of
   the congestion information can be done via the extension of the
   encapsulation protocol of the tunnel.

   A collector module for receiving the feedback congestion information
   from the egress SHOULD be added.  The collector can be distributed in
   the ingress or other network elements that have the capability of
   handling the congestion (such as the PDN-GW in the mobile
   communication network described in section 5.2).  Furthermore, some
   modules related with the congestion policy process can be added.
   However, no descriptions concerning this aspect are given in this
   document for the time being.

   In this model, the tunnel is an IP-in-IP tunnel.  Both the entry and
   egress of the tunnel are ECN-enabled and the intermediate routers in
   the tunnel path are also ECN-enabled.

   some extensions to the encapsulation protocol messages.  The details
   of the feedback process may differ in terms of the encapsulation
   protocols of the tunnel, but the general process is as shown in
   Figure 3.


5.  Example Scenarios

   This chapter presents three scenarios based on the basic model
   described in the previous chapter.  This chapter focuses on two
   aspects.  On the one hand, it describes the process of tunnel
   congestion exposure for each scenario, and on the other hand it
   stresses the significance of congestion exposure.

                          Figure 4: VPN Scenario

   Figure 4 is a simplified VPN multi-instance model.  A VPN tunnel is
   established between two PEs.  Before creating the VPN tunnel, the
   routing in the network between two PEs has been configured (e.g., in
   large networks, the BGP routing protocol is generally used).  CEs are

   connected to the networks where the users locate.  Both ends of the
   CE devices are located respectively in the VPN instance 1 (VPN 1) and
   VPN instance 2 (VPN 2).

   CE and PE are defined as follows:

   o  CE (Customer Edge): User network edge devices, which have
      interfaces directly to the SP (Service Provider) networks.  A CE
      can be a switch and can also be a host.  Usually, the CE cannot
      sense the presence of the VPN and it does not need to support the
      VPN features.

   o  PE (Provider Edge): IP network edge devices, which are connected
      to CEs directly.  In the VPN network, all processing of VPN
      instances is on the PEs.

   In this scenario, the VPN Tunnel is the object drawing our attention.
   The two PEs are the powerful nodes that acting as the entry and
   egress of the tunnel, receiving and sending back the congestion
   information.  The PEs can also do more operations of the traffic
   management.  The process is almost the same as that of the basic
   model.

5.2.  Mobile Scenario

   Figure 5 is the scenario in the EPS (Evolved Packet System), where
   two PMIP tunnels exist, i.e., PMIP tunnel between eNodeB and the
   S-GW, and between the S-GW and the PDN-GW.  In this scenario, we can
   just expose the congestion information of the backhaul tunnel segment
   (Note: It is an assumption that core network has extremely low
   possibility of congestion).  With the extensive use of mobile
   communication network and variable traffic rate per user, backhaul
   network congestion problems get more unpredictable.  If the
   congestion information in the backhaul network can be exposed, the
   PDN-GW MAY reuse the exposed congestion information to do flow
   control, which is helpful to improve the performance of the entire
   network and enhance the user experience.

   There are significant differences between this scenario and the VPN
   scenario.

   o  First of all, the congestion information is reported to PDN-GW
      rather than the ingress.

   o  Secondly, no congestion feedback exists in the backhaul network in
      both the uplink and downlink.

Internet-Draft         Tunnel Congestion Exposure           October 2012


   o  In addition, the object which is used to reporting the tunnel
      congestion information (PDN-GW) and the module used to record the
      congestion information are not in the same tunnel section.

                         Figure 5: Mobile Scenario

   In this scenario, the processing in the uplink and downlink SHOULD be
   distinguished.  The general process is as follows:

   o  The egress records the congestion information according to the
      description in the basic model.

   o  In the uplink direction, the egress is S-GW.  Therefore, the S-GW
      will report congestion information to the PDN-GW using the PMIP
      messages.

   o  In the down-link direction, the egress is the eNodeB.  The eNodeB
      feeds back the congestion information to the S-GW first using the
      PMIP messages.  Then the S-GW transfers the congestion information
      to the PDN-GW.

5.3.  IPv6 over IPv4 Scenario

   The tunnel used to connect IPv6 isolated islands in an IPv4 network
   is called IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel.

   In the early stage of the transition from the IPv4 Internet to the
   IPv6 Internet, the IPv4 networks have been well deployed while the
   IPv6 networks are isolated network islands spread around the world.
   Using a dedicated line to connect these isolated IPv6 islands is not
   economical obviously.  The usual practice is to use tunneling
   technology.  By using the tunneling technology to create a tunnel in
   the IPv4 network, the IPv6 islands can be interconnected through the
   IPv4 networks.  This is similar to the deployment of VPNs in the IP
   networks through the tunneling technology.

                     Figure 6: IPv6 over IPv4 Scenario

   In this scenario, the two gateways, namely Gateway1 and Gateway2,
   perform admission control.  They are the endpoints of the connection
   to the two IPv6 isolated islands and serve as the ingress and egress
   of the tunnel.  It can be seen from above, the specific congestion
   exposure mechanisms are consistent with the basic model.

   The congestion information is exposed at the ingress, we can use the
   congestion information to do a lot of significant things.


6.  The General Solution

6.1.  Statement of Requirements

   o  All tunnels are IP-in-IP type.

   o  Tunnel path supports the ECN mechanism--that is, the ingress, the
      egress and intermediate nodes are ECN enabled.

   o  The tunnel is configured to support feedback congestion
      information.

   o  A powerful device exists in the tunnel which is used for
      processing the congestion information.

Internet-Draft         Tunnel Congestion Exposure           October 2012


6.2.  The General Procedure

   o  In case of congestion, network element (ingress and egress of the
      tunnel, intermediate routers etc.) performs marking operations on
      packets according to AQM algorithm.

   o  The egress of the tunnel calculates congestion information by
      recording the number of congestion and total package periodically.

   o  The egress of the tunnel feeds back congestion information to the
      functional traffic management entity (such as: the ingress of the
      tunnel).  In the tunnel, if the transport protocol is UDP, the
      congestion information is fed back by extending signaling of the
      encapsulation protocol.  In this step, the encapsulation signaling
      SHOULD be extended.  For example, in the IPSec tunnel, the IPSec
      signaling messages should be extended which are used for sending
      back the congestion information to the collector module.

   o  Congestion information receiving object (functional entity
      executing flow management) disposes congestion information when
      the congestion threshold level is reached.  Here, we can define
      the different congestion levels according to the actual situations
      or requirements.  For the simplest condition, we can divide the
      congestion conditions into three types: the high congestion,
      moderate congestion, and low-grade congestion.  This process
      involves things like collecting congestion information, making
      policy control based on the congestion information and etc.


7.  Next Steps

   At present, this document focuses on how to expose the tunnel
   congestion to the ingress of the tunnel which has flow control and
   policy control functions etc.  In this document, a basic model for
   congestion exposure is proposed, a general solution is introduced,
   and several scenarios for applying the basic model are described.
   However, no excessive details are given.

   In the following versions, more details and processes of the tunnel
   congestion exposure will be introduced.  Which type of congestion
   information and how to use the information will also be discussed.
   In the near future, more than one document will be used to describe
   these practices.
