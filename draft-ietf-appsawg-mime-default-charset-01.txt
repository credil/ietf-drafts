Internet-Draft         MIME Charset Default Update            March 2012


1.  Introduction and Overview

   [RFC2046] specified that the default charset parameter (i.e. the
   value used when it is not specified) is "US-ASCII".  [RFC2616]
   changed the default for use by HTTP to be "ISO-8859-1".  This
   encoding is not very common for new text/* media types and a special
   rule in HTTP adds confusion about which specification ([RFC2046] or
   [RFC2616]) is authoritative in regards to the default charset for
   text/* media types. [[anchor2: At the time of writing of this
   document the IETF HTTPBIS WG is working on an update to RFC 2616
   which removes the default charset of "ISO-8859-1" for "text/*" media
   types.  It is expected that the set of HTTPBIs documents will
   reference this document in order to use the updated rules of default
   charset in "text/*" media types.]]

   Many complex text subtypes such as text/html [RFC2854] and text/xml
   [RFC3023] have internal (to their format) means of describing the
   charset.  Many existing User Agents ignore the default of "US-ASCII"
   rule for at least text/html and text/xml.

   This document changes RFC 2046 rules regarding default charset
   parameter values for text/* media types to better align with common
   usage by existing clients and servers.  It does not change the
   defaults for any currently registered media type.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  New rules for default charset parameter values for text/* media
    types

   Section 4.1.2 of [RFC2046] says:

      The default character set, which must be assumed in the absence of
      a charset parameter, is US-ASCII.

   As explained in the Introduction section this rule is considered to
   be outdated, so this document replaces it with the following set of
   rules:

   Each subtype of the "text" media type which uses the "charset"
   parameter can define its own default value for the "charset"
   parameter, including absence of any default.

   In order to improve interoperability with deployed agents, "text/*"
   media type registrations SHOULD either

   a.  specify that the "charset" parameter is not used for the defined
       subtype, because the charset information is transported inside
       the payload (such as in "text/xml"), or
   b.  require explicit unconditional inclusion of the "charset"
       parameter eliminating the need for a default value.

   In accordance with option (a), above, registrations for "text/*"
   media types that can transport charset information inside the
   corresponding payloads (such as "text/html" and "text/xml") SHOULD
   NOT specify the use of a "charset" parameter, nor any default value,
   in order to avoid conflicting interpretations should the charset
   parameter value and the value specified in the payload disagree.

   New subtypes of the "text" media type, thus, SHOULD NOT define a
   default "charset" value.  If there is a strong reason to do so
   despite this advice, they SHOULD use the "UTF-8" [RFC3629] charset as
   the default.

   Specifications of how to specify the "charset" parameter, and what
   default value, if any, is used, are subtype-specific, NOT protocol-
   specific.  Protocols that use MIME, therefore, MUST NOT override
   default charset values for "text/*" media types to be different for
   their specific protocol.  The protocol definitions MUST leave that to
   the subtype definitions.


4.  Default charset parameter value for text/plain media type

   The default charset parameter value for text/plain is unchanged from
   [RFC2046] and remains as "US-ASCII".


5.  Security Considerations

   Guessing of the charset parameter can lead to security issues such as
   content buffer overflows, denial of services or bypass of filtering
   mechanisms.  However, this document does not promote guessing, but
   encourages use of charset information that is specified by the
   sender.

   Conflicting information in-band vs out-of-band can also lead to
   similar security problems, and this document recommends the use of
   charset information which is more likely to be correct (for example,
   in-band over out-of-band).

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document asks IANA to update the "text" subregistry of the Media
   Types registry to additionally point to this document.
