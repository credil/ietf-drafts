Internet-Draft          Sender Queue Info Option               July 2013


1.  Introduction

   This draft describes an extension to the SCTP sockets API (see
   [RFC6458], [I-D.dreibholz-tsvwg-sctpsocket-multipath] [RFC4960])
   which allows an application to query the sender queue utilization per
   stream.  This information is necessary for applications to make
   efficient use of a mapping of streams to dissimilar paths.  A
   detailed description including simulation results can be found in
   [PFLDNeT2010].

   In particular, this API extension is useful when using the CMT-SCTP,
   CMT/RPv1-SCTP, CMT/RPv2-SCTP and MPTCP-like extensions (see
   [I-D.tuexen-tsvwg-sctp-multipath], [Dre2012], [PAMS2012], [PAMS2011],
   [ConTEL2011], [SoftCOM2011], [Globecom2010]) for Concurrent Multipath
   Transfer (CMT) with SCTP.

1.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Sender Queue Info (SCTP_SQINFO)

   This socket option obtains the maximum sender queue size (in bytes),
   the current total sender queue utilization (in bytes) as well as the
   current utilization per stream (in bytes).

   The following structure is used to obtain the sender queue
   information:

   struct sctp_sndqueueinfo {
     sctp_assoc_t sq_assoc_id;
     uint32_t     sq_queue_limit;
     uint32_t     sq_total_queued;
     uint32_t     sq_number_of_streams;
     uint32_t     sq_queued_on_stream[];
   };

   sq_assoc_id:  This parameter is ignored for one-to-one style sockets.
      For one-to-many style sockets this parameter indicates which
      association the user is performing an action upon.  It is an error
      to use SCTP_{CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC in sq_assoc_id.

Internet-Draft          Sender Queue Info Option               July 2013


   sq_queue_limit:  This field gives the maximum sender queue size in
      bytes.

   sq_total_queued:  This field gives the current total sender queue
      utilization in bytes.

   sq_number_of_streams:  This field gives the number of outgoing
      streams.  That is, it will contain the number of valid
      sq_queued_on_stream entries.

   sq_queued_on_stream:  This array gives the current number of bytes
      queued for the streams 0 to sq_number_of_streams-1.

   Note, that the caller of getsockopt() MUST provide a
   sctp_sndqueueinfo structure which can hold at least as many
   sq_queued_on_stream entries as the association's number of outgoing
   streams.  Otherwise, the getsockopt() call will fail and return an
   error.


3.  Testbed Platform

   A large-scale and realistic Internet testbed platform with support
   for the multi-homing feature of the underlying SCTP protocol is
   NorNet.  A description of NorNet is provided in [PAMS2013-NorNet],
   some further information can be found on the project website
   [NorNet-Website].


4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the SCTP sockets API are described by
   [RFC6458].


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require IANA actions.


6.  Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank Michael Tuexen and Irene Ruengeler
   for their support.
