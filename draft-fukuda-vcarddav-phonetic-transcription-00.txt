Internet-Draft        phonetic transcription Extensions   September 2013


1.  Introduction

   As for the name, the pronunciation(and phonetic transcription) is
   different according to each country. To describe the pronunciation of
   the name, the property is added.

1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Syntax specifications shown here use the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234], and are specified as in the base
   vcard specification [RFC6350].


2.  Identification Property Extensions

   The following sections define the phonetic transcription property.

2.1.  Property: PHONETIC-FAMILY-NAME

   Namespace:

   Property name:  PHONETIC-FAMILY-NAME

   Purpose:  To specify the pronunciation of the family name of the 
       object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Cardinality:  *1

   Property parameters:

   Description:  To express the pronunciation of the family name, you
        MAY write the PHONETIC-FAMILY-NAME property in a 
        country-specific-language.

   Format definition:
     PHONETIC-FAMILY-NAME-param = "VALUE=text"
     PHONETIC-FAMILY-NAME-value = text

   Examples:
       PHONETIC-FAMILY-NAME:[phonetic family name]
       (The family name is written in phonetic name.)
       PHONETIC-FAMILY-NAME:[Japanese katakana]
       (The family name is written in Japanese katakana.)

       PHONETIC-FAMILY-NAME:[Japanese hiragana]
       (The family name is written in Japanese kana.)


2.2.  Property: PHONETIC-GIVEN-NAME

   Namespace:

   Property name:  PHONETIC-GIVEN-NAME

   Purpose:  To specify the pronunciation of the given name of the 
       object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Cardinality:  *1

   Property parameters:

   Description:  To express the pronunciation of the given name, you
        MAY write the PHONETIC-GIVEN-NAME property in a 
        country-specific-language.

   Format definition:
     PHONETIC-GIVEN-NAME-param = "VALUE=text"
     PHONETIC-GIVEN-NAME-value = text

   Examples:
       PHONETIC-GIVEN-NAME:[phonetic given name]
       (The given name is written in phonetic name.)
       PHONETIC-GIVEN-NAME:[Japanese hiragana]
       (The given name is written in Japanese kana.)
       PHONETIC-GIVEN-NAME:[Japanese katakana]
       (The given name is written in Japanese katakana.)


3.  Security Considerations

   This presents no security considerations beyond those in section 9 of
   the base vcard specification [RFC6350].


4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add the following entries to the vCard
   Properties registry, defined in [RFC6350] section 10.3.1.

     +-----------+--------------+-------------------------------+
     | Namespace | Property              | Reference            |
     +-----------+--------------+-------------------------------+
     |           | PHONETIC-FAMILY-NAME  | RFCXXXX, section 2.1 |
     |           | PHONETIC-GIVEN-NAME   | RFCXXXX, section 2.2 |
