           Incremental Label Announcement Extensions for LDP
                     draft-ldp-ila-extension-01.txt

Abstract

   The current LDP Graceful Restart (GR) mechanism specified in RFC3478
   requires a complete re-advertisement of the LDP label binding
   information across a session restart, even though complete label
   binding information might be preserved.

   In this document we specify extensions to LDP graceful restart in
   order to support avoiding unnecessary transmission of the label
   binding information preserved across a session restart, thus
   accelerating the router re-convergence.  More specifically, we
   describe a version number based batching mechanism for keeping track
   of the label binding information across a session restart.

   The new 1) LDP ILA capability TLV, 2) LDP VERSION ID TLV and 3) LDP
   ILA Version message type, is introduced for checkpointing the label
   binding version maintained for a neighbor.  We also specify
   procedures for handling label binding table version update across a
   session restart.

Internet-Draft   Incremental Label Announcement for LDP     January 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a new LDP Incremental Label Announcement
   extension for LDP Graceful restart.  This mechanism avoids
   unnecessary transmission of the label binding information during
   session restarts and thus improve the overall router convergence.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Incremental Label Announcement Capability TLV

   The LDP Incremental Label Announcement (ILA) Capability TLV is used
   by an LDP speaker to list the FEC types that support the ILA
   capability.  This TLV MUST be announced in the LDP initialization
   message along with the LDP FT Session TLV.  An implementation that
   support LDP ILA MUST implement the procedures for Capability
   Parameters in LDP Initialization Messages.

   The format of a "Incremental Label Announcement Capability" TLV is as
   follows:


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |U|F| ILA Capability (TBD IANA)   |     Length                  |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |S| Reserved    |                                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+          FEC Type List                        |
       |                                           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   U-bit:
            The Unknown TLV bit should be set to the value 1.

   F-bit:
            The forward unknown TLV bit should be set to the value 0.

   ILA Capability:
            The ILA Capability code is assigned by IANA (TBD).

  Length:
           The length indicates the number of octets for S/Reserved byte
           and the bytes found in the FEC Type List Data.

S-bit:
        The State Bit MUST always be set to 1.  It indicates whether the
        sender is advertising or withdrawing the capability
        corresponding to the TLV code point.

        The State Bit value is used as follows:

          1 - The TLV is advertising the capability specified by the TLV
              code point.

          0 - The TLV is withdrawing the capability specified by the TLV
              code point.

FEC Type List:
         The FEC type list indicates the sender supported ILA FEC types.
         Each Octet of FEC Type List Data corresponds to a FEC type
         defined in the LDP Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) Type
         Namespace.


3.  Incremental Label Announcement FEC Version TLV

   The ILA Version TLV is defined for controlling/versioning label
   mapping advertisements/withdraw messages for a given FEC type.  This
   TLV is used by the receiver of the label advertisements/withdraw
   message to request which versions of Label bindings the LDP speaker
   should announce from.  Furthermore, it is also used by the LDP
   speaker to verify that the labels advertisements for a given FEC type
   do fall within the specified version id.  The LDP speaker uses this
   information in generating incremental announcements.

   The "ILA Version" TLV has the following format:


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |U|F| ILA Version (TBD IANA)      |       Length = 12           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |   FEC Type    |    Mode         |   Reserved (must be zero)   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                 Label Version ID (8 octets)                   |
       |                                                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   U-bit:
            The Unknown TLV bit MUST be set to the value 0.

   F-bit:
            The forward unknown TLV bit MUST be set to the value 0.

   ILA Version:
            The ILA Version TLV type is assigned by IANA (TBD).

   Length:
            The length field is always set to 12.

   FEC type:
           Identifies the FEC type for which the ILA version message
           applies.

    Mode:
            0 - Request Mode: Request label bindings starting from
                specified version.
            1 - Assign Mode:  Assign the specified version ID to the
                bindings that follow.


    Label Version ID:
            A 64 bit version number.


4.  Incremental Label Announcement Version Message

   The new Incremental Label Announcement Version message is used by the
   speaker to send 1 or more ILA Version TLVs.  This message contains
   one or more per FEC type TLVs used to request the peer to start
   sending labels with a given version number and to inform the peer the
   current version ID assigned to the bindings that follow.  If there
   are multiple TLVs of a specific FEC type, at most there MUST be one
   Version-id "request", and Version-ID "assign" TLV for a given FEC
   type.

   An LDP speaker MUST not send this message unless the LDP peer has
   previously announced its ability to support the ILA capabilities.
   Only the LDP FEC types supported by both endpoints should appear in
   the the ILA version TLVs.  If unsupported FEC types appear, they will
   be discarded by the receiver.

   The ILA Version message is defined as following:

   where TLV_1 through TLV_N are currently used for ILA Version-ID TLVs.



5.  Procedures

5.1.  Session Initialization

   An LDP speaker that is capable and willing to support the ILA
   procedures for a given FEC type advertises this ability through the
   Incremental Label Announcement Capability TLV in the LDP session
   initialization message.  The ILA Capability TLV MUST only be included
   in the LDP initialization message if LDP initialization message
   contains a FT session TLV indicating its ability to support LDP
   Graceful Restart.  The sender of the ILA Capability TLV MUST include
   all the FEC types for which it intends to support ILA procedures.
   The set of FEC types that is found in both the sent ILA Capability
   TLV and the received ILA Capability TLV represents the FEC types for
   which both LDP endpoints will follow ILA procedures when advertising/
   withdrawing label bindings.

   The FEC type list may potentially change across a LDP restart.  When
   this happens, the bindings for FEC types previously supporting ILA
   that changed disappeared for the new LDP session need to be purged.

5.2.  Label Mapping Sender/Receiver (LM-S/LM-R)

   During label mapping advertisement/withdraw, an LDP endpoint plays
   the role of the label mapping sender (LM-S) or label mapping receiver
   (LM-R).

   For FEC types which the ILA procedures apply, the LM-S will need to
   maintain a local label binding table and associate an ILA VERSION-ID



Lo, et al.                Expires July 4, 2012                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   Incremental Label Announcement for LDP     January 2012


   with each binding.  Each time a local label binding changes (such
   that a re-advertisement or withdraw needs to be sent), the VERSION-ID
   for the binding must be updated such that the value is greater than
   or equal to the current VERSION-ID being used to advertise/withdraw
   label mapping bindings.  The local label binding table and associated
   VERSION-ID must be maintained across a LDP session restart.  This
   version id can be managed either on a router basis or on a per
   session level and is left to the implementer.

   The LM-R similarly, will need to keep 1) bindings learned from an
   LM-S in a remote binding table, and 2) the last VERSION-ID "assign"
   value learned from the LM-S.  Both the remote binding table and the
   LM-S version ID "assign" value needs to be maintained across a LDP
   session restart.

   After session establishments, the LM-S must wait for a VERSION-ID
   "request" message from the LM-R.  The LM-R sends the VERSION-ID that
   it last processed from the LM-S.  If the LM-R needs to purge its
   remote binding table, it can optionally send a VERSION ID=0 "request"
   to the LM-S request that it re-send all its bindings.  The LM-R does
   not necessarily send a VERSION-ID "request" TLV immediately after a
   session is established.  It sends the request when it's ready to
   receive bindings.

   After receiving a VERSION-ID "request" message from the LM-R, an LM-S
   should send a VERSION-ID "assign" message starting with VERSION-ID
   not greater than the VERSION-ID requested by the LM-R.  The LM-R upon
   receiving the VERSION-ID "assign", must mark all bindings with
   VERSION-ID greater than the assigned VERSION-ID as stale and purge
   them after the graceful restart period expires.  The LM-S should then
   scan its local label binding table and advertise/withdraw bindings
   with VERSION-IDs starting with the version id less than or equal to
   the VERSION-ID "assign" message.  The LM-S MUST also scan its local
   label binding table and mark all previously withdrawn bindings with
   VERSION-ID less than the "request" version ID as released.

   If the LM-S is not able to honor sending with the requested
   Version-ID, it should send a VERSION-ID "assign" message with
   VERSION-ID equal to zero to indicate that all previously advertised
   label bindings should be discarded and that the LM-S will be re-
   advertising all bindings.  The bindings to be removed needs to be
   marked stale and purged if not reclaimed after the GR recovery
   period.

   Unlike the existing LDP Graceful restart behavior, after a session
   goes down and is re-established, label bindings previously advertised
   are not implied withdrawn, so an LM-S MUST keep track of all its
   bindings and withdraw them.  If bindings are deleted from the local

Internet-Draft   Incremental Label Announcement for LDP     January 2012


   label binding table while a "downed" neighbor is still in a LDP GR
   recovery period, that session must be flagged to indicate that if the
   LDP session re-establishes, then a VERSION ID "assign" message must
   use a value=0, to force the LM-R to purge all previously learned
   bindings.

5.3.  ILA Version ID=0 Handling

   VERSION-ID=0 is a special value that MUST NOT be used as a version-id
   value for a label mapping.  If an LM-S sends a VERSION-ID assign TLV
   with this version ID:

      1) the LM-R upon processing this message, MUST mark all it's
      received bindings as stale and follow LDP GR restart procedures.

      2) The LM-S does not need to send label withdraws for previously
      advertised bindings, as all previously advertised bindings are
      implied withdrawn.

5.4.  ILA Version ID Assignment

   It's left to the implementer to decide how to assign ILA VERSION-ID
   values to label mappings and how frequently to send per FEC type ILA
   Version ID "assign" updates from the LM-S to the LM-R.  The simplest
   approach is to assign a unique version ID per label mapping messages.
   Unlike BGP, LDP announcements complete in a relative short period
   after the LDP session re-establishes, so a single ILA VERSION-ID
   update per FEC type sent after finishing LIB advertisement completes
   is sufficient.

5.5.  ILA Version ID wraparound

   The Version ID field is defined as a 64 bit value, so wraparound is
   unlikely unless the implementer uses a fewer number of bytes
   internally to represent the version-id.  This section describes how
   to handle this rare case.  Since the each subsequent VERSION-ID needs
   to be assigned a value greater than the previously assigned value,
   when wraparound occurs, this situations needs to be handled otherwise
   the ILA procedures will fail if the session resets before the re-
   announcment updates to the LM-R completes.

   When wraparound occurs, the LM-S MUST:

      mark all the affected LDP peers with a "re-announcement required"
      flag indicating that labels must be completely re-announced.

      send an ILA VERSION-ID =1 "assign" update to reset the version id
      to lest possible value for every affected LM-R.

      walk entire LIB and update the VERSION-ID value of every label
      binding.

      reannounce all local label bindings to the affected LM-R.

      for each affected LM-R, clear the "re-announce required" flag only
      after VERSION-ID renumber/re-announcement is complete.

   If the LDP session goes down and re-establishes with the "re-announce
   require"d flag still set, the LM-S MUST respond to the LM-R
   VERSION-ID request with a LM-S VERSION-ID "Assign" with version-id
   set to 0 and re-announce all its bindings.
