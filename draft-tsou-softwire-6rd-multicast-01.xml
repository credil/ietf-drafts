<abstract>
	<t>This document describes how IPv6 multicast can be extended across 
	an IPv4 network to an IPv6 host, using the native multicast capabilities
	of the IPv4 network.</t> 
</abstract>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

	<t>6rd (<xref target="RFC5569"/>, <xref target="RFC5969"/>) provides 
	a means to connect IPv6 hosts to the IPv6 Internet across an IPv4 provider
	network. Unicast traffic is carried through IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels. It
	is possible to carry multicast traffic from the IPv6 network through
	the IPv4 network in the same way, but if multiple customers wish access
	to the same multicast channels, the failure to use the native multicast
	capabilities of the IPv4 network wastes resources in that network.  </t>

	<t>This document describes a solution use the native multicast capabilities
	of the IPv4 network to acquire and forward multicast traffic from IPv6
	Internet to an IPv6 host attached to the IPv4 network. Typically this
	solution will operate in combination with 6rd for unicast traffic. However,
	no IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling is required for signalling, only the ability to 
	interwork between IPv4 and IPv6 at the 6rd Customer Equipment (6rd CE) and 
	the 6rd Border Relay (6rd BR). </t>

	<section title="Terminology">
	
		<t>The term "address pair" is used to denote the combination of unicast
		source address and multicast group address corresponding to a given
		multicast stream at a given point along the path between the source and
		receiver. </t>
		
	</section>
	
</section> <!-- intro -->

<section anchor="sol" title="Description of the Solution">

	<t>A number of problems have to be solved to allow an IPv6 host attached
	to an IPv4 network to request and receive a multicast stream originating
	in a neighbouring IPv6 network and passing through the IPv4 network using
	the native multicast facilities of that network. These problems are 
	described in detail in the course of presenting proposed solutions to
	them. </t>
	
	<t>It is assumed that the IPv6 host that wishes to receive a multicast stream
	acquires the corresponding IPv6 address pair by means out of scope of this
	document. See <xref target="ID.tsou-mboned-multrans-addr-acq"/>. </t>
	
	<section anchor="arch" title="Assumed Architecture">
	
		<t>This document assumes an architecture similar to that of 6rd 
		<xref target="RFC5569"/>, <xref target="RFC5969"/>, with additional
		capabilities for the 6rd Customer Edge (CE) and the 6rd Border Relay (6rd BR). See 
		<xref target="fig_mularch"/>.</t>

		<t>In addition to its 6rd responsibilities, the 6rd CE is responsible for:

			IPv6 Host to IGMP <xref target="RFC3376"/> forwarded toward the

			<t>using the reverse mapping from IPv6 to IPv4 address
			pairs to translate incoming IPv4 multicast streams to IPv6 before 
			forwarding them to the IPv6 Host. Alternatively, decapsulating IPv6
			multicast data packets from incoming IPv4 packets.</t>
		</list>
		</t>	
		
		<t>The Provider IP Edge has the normal function of interworking 
		between IGMP <xref target="RFC3376"/> and PIM <xref target="RFC4601"/>
		multicast signalling.</t>
		
		<t>The Border Relay has the usual 6rd responsibilities. In addition, 
		it is responsible for:
		<list style="symbols">
			<t>mapping between IPv4 address pairs received in PIM messages from the
			IPv4 network and IPv6 address pairs denoting the same multicast streams
			in the neighbouring IPv6 network;</t>
			
			<t>interworking PIM between the IPv4 and IPv6 networks;</t>
			
			<t>using the reverse mapping from IPv6 to IPv4 address pairs to
			translate and forward multicast data packets coming from the IPv6
			network. Alternatively, using the reverse mapping to generate
			encapsulating IPv4 headers for the IPv6 packets before forwarding
			them as multicast IPv4 data.</t>

	<section anchor="solSteps" title="Components of the Proposed Solution">
	
		<section anchor="map" title="Address Mapping">
	 
	 	  <t>Both the 6rd CE and the 6rd BR need to map between IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, 
	 	  in both directions. The IPv6 address pairs do not have to be the same at the
	 	  two nodes, so long as the IPv6 address pair used by the host designates the
	 	  same multicast stream as the IPv6 address pair generated at the 6rd BR or
	 	  received from the source IPv6 network.</t>
	 	  
	 	  <t>Because the source network uses IPv6, mapping between the addresses
	 	  used in that network and the IPv4 addresses used in the provider network
	 	  is in general a difficult problem. The most general solution is to 
	 	  configure static mappings between the IPv6 and corresponding IPv4 address
	 	  pairs at the 6rd BR. Mapping at the 6rd CE can use IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses
	 	  as defined in <xref target="RFC6052"/> for the unicast source addresses,
	 	  and <xref target="ID.mboned-64-mcast-addr-fmt"/> for the multicast group
	 	  addresses. This assumes that the IPv6 host has been provided with such
	 	  addresses in the first place. It also assumes that the IPv4 network provider
	 	  can configure suitable prefixes at the 6rd CE for the purpose of such
	 	  mapping.</t>
	 	  
	 	  <t>With restrictions on the IPv6 addresses used for multicast source and 
	 	  group addresses in the IPv6 network, it may be possible to use algorithmic
	 	  instead of static mapping at the 6rd BR. This generally requires 
	 	  coordination between the IPv4 and IPv6 network operators.</t>
	 
	  </section>
	  
	  
	  <section anchor="rout" title="Multicast Routing">
	 
	 	  <t>For each IPv4 address to which an IPv6 source address is mapped, the
	 	  routing tables that PIM uses must result in a path that passes through a
	 	  multicast-enabled 6rd BR. At the routing level, this means that the 6rd BR must
	 	  advertise reachability to the mapped IPv4 source addresses it knows about
	 	  into the IPv4 domain. Its distance metrics to those addresses must reflect
	 	  the routing information it receives on the IPv6 side for their IPv6 
	 	  counterparts.  </t>

	  <section anchor="mldIGMP" title="Translation From MLD To IGMP">
	 
	 	  <t>See <xref target="ID.perreault-igmp-mld-translation"/>.</t>
	 
	  </section>
	  
	  
	  <section anchor="pimINTWK" title="Interworking Between PIM With IPv4 and PIM with IPv6 At the 6rd BR">
	 
	 	  <t>See <xref target="ID.taylor-pim-v4v6-translation"/>.</t>
	 
	  </section>
 		
	  
 	  <section anchor="data" title="Transport of Multicast Data Packets and Unicast RTCP Feedback">
 	
 		  <t>The documents cited in the previous two sections describe the process of
 		  header translation for multicast data packets. The address mapping aspect
 		  of that translation was discussed in <xref target="map"/>. If the 6rd BR and 
 		  6rd CE are configured to use encapsulation/decapsulation of multicast data
 		  packets instead, the encapsulating IPv4 header uses the IPv4 address pair
 		  mapped from the original IPv6 address pair as source and destination. 
 		  However, this requires that the IPv6 host uses the same IPv6 addresses 
 		  as the source IPv6 network for each multicast stream it receives. That may
 		  force the 6rd CE to use static rather than algorithmic mapping for address
 		  pairs for its MLD/IGMP translation. </t>
 	
 		  <t>When the IPv6 Host sends unicast RTCP <xref target="RFC3550"/> 
 		  feedback toward the source, the packets are treated by the 6rd CE and
 		  6rd BR like any other unicast packets. That is, they are encapsulated
 		  at the 6rd CE, transported across the IPv4 network as IPv6-in-IPv4, and
 		  decapsulated at the 6rd BR before forwarding into the IPv6 network.</t>
