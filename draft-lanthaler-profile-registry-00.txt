Internet-Draft              Profile registry                  April 2013


1.  Introduction

   Profiles, as defined by [RFC6906], can be used to signal support for
   additional semantics, such as constraints, conventions, extensions,
   or any other aspects that do not alter the basic media type
   semantics.  Profiles are identified by a URI and can thus be created
   without central coordination.

   Similarly to media types and link relation types it is, in some
   cases, beneficial to centrally manage profile URIs to ensure
   interoperability and decrease the coupling between clients and
   servers.  This allows the independent evolution of clients and
   servers as both are coupled to these central contracts instead of
   being coupled to each other.  Therefore, this document establishes an
   IANA registry of such profile URIs.  Furthermore, this document
   creates and registers an IETF URN Sub-namespace, as documented in
   [RFC3553], to be used for specifications standardizing profiles.  The
   new "profile" Sub-namespace is urn:ietf:params:profile and concrete
   profiles will be established underneath it.


2.  Registration Process

   All elements in this registry will require a URI in order to be
   registered.  If the registrant wishes to have a URI assigned, then a
   URN of the form

      urn:ietf:params:profile:<value>

   will be assigned where <value> is a suitable representation of the
   semantics being registered.

   The registration request for the urn:ietf:params:profile URN Sub-
   namespace can be found in Section 5.3.


3.  Example Registration Request

   The following is an example registration request for a URI underneath
   the urn:ietf:params:profile Sub-namespace.

   This is a request to IANA to please register the value "example" in
   the registry urn:ietf:params:profile established in an IETF URN Sub-
   namespace for Profile URIs.

   o  Profile URI: urn:ietf:params:profile:example

   o  Common Name: Exemplary Profile

   o  Description: A profile to be used in examples.

   o  Specification Document: [this document]


4.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations beyond those already
   inherent to using URNs.  Security considerations for URNs in general
   can be found in [RFC2141].


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes two requests two IANA:

   o  Establishment of a new registry for profile URIs.  Instructions
      for a registrant to request the registration of such a URI are in
      Section 2.  The registration request can be found in Section 5.1
      below.

   o  Registration of a new IANA URN sub-namespace,
      urn:ietf:params:profile, per [RFC3553].  The registration request
      can be found in Section 5.3 below.

5.1.  Profile URI Registry

   This document establishes the Profile URI registry.  The registration
   procedure for new entries requires a request in the form of the
   following template and is "Specification Required" per [RFC5226].

   The underlying registry data (e.g., the XML file) must include
   Simplified BSD License text as described in Section 4.e of the Trust
   Legal Provisions (<http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info>).

   The registration template is:

   o  Profile URI: The URI that identifies the registered profile.

   o  Common Name: The name by which the profile being registered is
      generally known.

   o  Description: A short description of the profile

   o  Specification Document: Reference to the document that specifies
      the URI, preferably including a URI that can be used to retrieve a

      copy of the document.  An indication of the relevant sections may
      also be included but is not required.

   o  Notes: [optional]

5.2.  Initial Registry Contents

   The Profile URI registry's initial contents are:

   o  Profile URI: urn:ietf:params:profile:example
   o  Common Name: Exemplary Profile
   o  Description: A profile to be used in examples.
   o  Specification Document: [this document]

5.3.  IETF URN Sub-Namespace Registration urn:ietf:params:profile

   Per [RFC3553], this document IANA registers the new URN Sub-
   namespace, urn:ietf:params:profile.

   o  Registry name: profile

   o  Specification: [this document]

   o  Repository: The registry established in Section 5.1

   o  Index value: values subordinate to urn:ietf:params:profile are of
      the form urn:ietf:params:profile:<value> with <value> as the index
      value.  When practical, it is suggested that <value> includes both
      a "class" and an "identifier-within-class" component, with the two
      components being separated by a colon (":"); other compositions of
      the <value> may also be used.
