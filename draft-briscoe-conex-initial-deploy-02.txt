1.  Introduction

   This document gives examples of how ConEx deployment might get
   started, focusing on unilateral deployment by a single network.

2.  Recap: Incremental Deployment Features of the ConEx Protocol

   The ConEx mechanism document [ConEx-Abstract-Mech] goes to great
   lengths to design for incremental deployment in all the respects
   below.  It should be referred to for precise details on each of these
   points:

   o  The ConEx mechanism is essentially a change to the source, in
      order to re-insert congestion feedback into the network.

   o  Source-host-only deployment is possible without any negotiation
      required, and individual transport protocol implementations within
      a source host can be updated separately.

   o  Receiver modification may optionally improve ConEx for some
      transport protocols with feedback limitations (TCP being the main
      example), but it is not a necessity

   o  Proxies for the source and/or receiver are feasible (though not
      necessarily straightforward)

   o  Queues and network forwarding do not require any modification for
      ConEx.

   o  ECN is not required in the network for ConEx.  If some network
      nodes support ECN, it can be used by ConEx.

   o  ECN is not required at the receiver for ConEx.  The sender should
      nonetheless attempt to negotiate ECN-usage with the receiver,
      given some aspects of ConEx work better the more ECN is deployed,
      particularly auditing and border measurement.

   o  Given ConEx exposes information for IP-layer policy devices to
      use, the design does not preclude possible innovative uses of
      ConEx information by other IP-layer devices, e.g. forwarding
      itself

   o  Packets indicate whether or not they support ConEx.

3.  ConEx Components

3.1.  Recap of Basic ConEx Components

   [ConEx-Abstract-Mech] introduces the following components:

   o  The ConEx Wire Protocol

   o  Forwarding devices (unmodified)

   o  Sender (modified for ConEx)

   o  Receiver (optionally modified)

   o  Audit

   o  Policy Devices:

      *  Rest-of-Path Congestion Monitoring Devices

      *  Congestion Policers

   [ConEx-Abstract-Mech] should be referred to for definitions of each
   of these components and further explanation.

3.2.  Per-Network Deployment Concepts

   Network deployment-related definitions:

   Internet Ingress:  The first IP node a packet traverses that is
      outside the source's own network.  In a domestic network that will
      be the first node downstream from the home access equipment.  In
      an enterprise network this is the provider edge router.

   Internet Egress:  The last IP node a packet traverses before reaching
      the receiver's network.

   ConEx-Enabled Network:  A network whose edge nodes implement ConEx
      policy functions.

   Each network can unilaterally choose to use any ConEx information
   given by those sources using ConEx, independently of whether other
   networks use it.

   Typically, a network will use ConEx information by deploying a policy
   function at the ingress edge of its network to monitor arriving
   traffic and to act in some way on the congestion information in those
   packets that are ConEx-enabled.  Actions might include policing,



Briscoe & Kutscher     Expires September 14, 2012               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      Initial ConEx Deployment Examples         March 2012


   altering the class of service, or re-routing.  Alternatively, less
   direct actions via a management system might include triggering
   capacity upgrades, triggering penalty clauses in contracts or levying
   charges between networks based on ConEx measurements.

   Typically, a network using ConEx info will deploy a ConEx policy
   function near the ingress edge and a ConEx audit function near the
   egress edge.  The segment of the path between a ConEx policy function
   and a ConEx audit function can be considered to be a ConEx-protected
   segment of the path.  Assuming a network covers all its ingresses and
   egresses with policy functions and audit functions respectively, the
   network within this ring will be a ConEx-protected network.

   Of course, because each edge device usually serves as both an ingress
   and an egress, the two functions are both likely to be present in
   each edge device.

4.  Example Initial Deployment Arrangements

   In all the deployment scenarios below, we assume that deployment
   starts with some data sources being modified with ConEx code.  The
   rationale for this is that the developer of a scavenger transport
   protocol like LEDBAT has a strong incentive to tell the network how
   little congestion it is causing despite sending large volumes of
   data.  In this case the developer makes the first move expecting it
   will prompt at least some networks to move in response--so that they
   use the ConEx information to reward users of the scavenger protocol.

4.1.  Single Receiving Network Scenario

   The name 'Receiving Network' for this scenario merely emphasises that
   most data is arriving from connected networks and data centres and
   being consumed by residential customers on this access network.  Some
   data is of course also travelling in the other direction.

                Figure 1: Single Receiving Network Scenario

   Figure Figure 1 is an attempt to show the salient features of a ConEx
   deployment in a typical broadband access provider's network (within
   the constraints of ASCII art).  Broadband remote access servers
   (BRASs) control access to the core network from the access network
   and vice versa.  Home networks (and small businesses) connect to the
   access network, but only two are shown.

   In this diagram, all data is travelling towards the access network of
   Home-b, from the Peer network, the Data centre, the CDN and Home-a.
   Data actually travels in both directions on all links, but only one
   direction is shown.

   The data centre, core and access network are all run by the same
   network operator, but each is the responsibility of a different
   department with internal accounting between them.  The content
   distribution network (CDN) is operated by a third party CDN provider,
   and of course the peer network is also operated by a third party.

   This operator of the data centre, core and access network is the only
   one in the diagram to have deployed ConEx monitoring and policy
   devices at the edges of its network.  However, it has not enabled ECN
   on any of its network elements and neither has any other network in
   the diagram.  The operator has deployed a congestion policing
   function (P) on the provider-edge router where the peer attaches to



Briscoe & Kutscher     Expires September 14, 2012               [Page 6]

   its core, on the BRAS where the CDN attaches and on the other BRAS
   where each of the residential customers like Home-a attach.  On the
   provider-edge router where the data centre attaches it has deployed a
   congestion monitoring function (M).  Each of these policing and
   monitoring functions handles the aggregate of all traffic traversing
   it, for all destinations.

   The operator has deployed an audit function on each logical output
   port of the BRAS for each end-customer site like Home-b.  The Audit
   function handles the aggregate of all traffic for that end-customer
   from all sources.  For traffic in the opposite direction (e.g. from
   Home-b to Home-a, there would be equivalent policing (P) and audit
   (A) functions in the converse locations to those shown.

   Some content sources in the CDN and in the data centre are using the
   ConEx protocol, but others are not.  There is a similar situation for
   hosts attached to the Peer network and hosts in home networks like
   Home-a: some are sending ConEx packets at least for bulk data
   transports, while others are not.

4.1.1.  ConEx Functions in the Single Receiving Network Scenario

   Within the BRAS there are logical ports that model the rate of each
   access line from the DSLAM to each home network [TR-059].  They are
   fed by a shared queue that models the rate of the downstream link
   from the BRAS to the DSLAM (sometimes called the backhaul network).
   If there is congestion anywhere in the set of networks in Figure
   Figure 1 it is nearly always:

   o  either self-congestion in the queues into the logical ports
      representing the access lines

   o  or shared congestion in the shared queue on the BRAS that feeds
      them.

   Any ConEx sources sending data through this BRAS will receive
   feedback about these losses from the destination and re-insert it as
   ConEx markings into the data.  Figure 2 shows an example plot of the
   loss levels that might be seen at different monitoring points along a
   path between the data centre and home-b, for instance.  The top half
   of the figure shows the loss probability within the BRAS consists of
   0.1% at the shared queue and 0.2% self-congestion in the logical
   output port that models the access line, making 0.3% in total.  This
   upper diagram also shows whole path congestion as signalled by the
   ConEx sender, which remains unchanged along the whole path at 0.3%.

   The lower half of the figure shows (downstream congestion) = (whole
   path) - (upstream congestion).  Upstream congestion can only be

Internet-Draft      Initial ConEx Deployment Examples         March 2012


   monitored locally where the loss actually happens (within the BRAS
   output queues).  Nonetheless, given there is rarely loss anywhere
   else but within the BRAS, this limitation is not significant in this
   scenario.  The lower half of the figure also shows the location of
   the policing and audit functions.  Policing anywhere within or
   upstream ofthe BRAS will be based on the downstream congestion level
   of 0.3%.  While Auditing within the BRAS but after all the queues can
   check that the whole path congestion signalled by ConEx is no less
   than the loss levels experienced within the BRAS itself.

4.1.2.  Incentives to Unilaterally Deploy ConEx in a Receiving Network

   Even a sending application that is modified to use ConEx can choose
   whether to send ConEx or Not-ConEx packets.  Nonethelss, ConEx
   packets bring information to a policer about congestion expected on
   the rest of the path beyond the policer.  Not-ConEx packets bring no
   such information.  Therefore a network that has deployed ConEx
   policers will tend to rate-limit not-ConEx packets conservatively in
   order to manage the unknown risk of congestion.  In contrast, a
   network doesn't normally need to rate-limit ConEx-enabled packets

   unless they reveal a persistently high contribution to congestion.
   This natural tendency for networks to favour senders that provide
   ConEx information encourages senders to choose to use the ConEx
   protocol whenever they can.

4.2.  Mobile Network Scenario

   Mobile networks (in general, but we focus on 3GPP EPS here) are
   another type of network that is generally amenable to initial CONEX
   deployment because of its need to make congestion visible to the
   network:

   Congestion management is highly important:  mobile network operators
      have traditionally gone to great extent to detect and act upon
      congestion at different locations in their networks.  Capacity
      investments are high, (especially) wireless resources have been
      comparatively scarce, and many physical resources (wireless links,
      backhaul links, core networks) are shared.

   Evolving from highly differentiated services to 'best-effort'
   communication:  The conversion to IP-based communication and to
      ubiquitous Internet access services has rendered traditional
      models of fine-granular differentiated services too inefficient
      and complicated.  The majority of flows are mapped onto best-
      effort bearers -- which calls for appropriate resource sharing and
      accounting models for such flows.

   Demand for congestion exposure at different levels:  The demand for
      more appropriate resource sharing in heavy usage scenarios has led
      to an increased deployment of Deep-Packet Inspection (DPI) --
      there is an obvious demand for informing the network about
      congestion on roundtrip time scales.  Moreover, 3GPP mobile
      network operators require congestion information at different
      time-scales, specifically on network-management time scales:
      Identifying hot-spots, analyzing overload situations and assisting
      network planning is routinely done by "drive tests" -- which could
      be simplified with a CONEX approach.  Congestion and base station
      load information is also exchanged in Self-Organized Networking
      (SON) to assist cell capacity optimization and hand-over decisions
      (at smaller time-scales).

   Mobile networks are also amenable to initial CONEX deployment because
   they already provide many prerequisites:






Briscoe & Kutscher     Expires September 14, 2012               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      Initial ConEx Deployment Examples         March 2012


   Elaborate and flexible policy and charging architecture:  Mobile
      networks today employ an elaborate and flexible policy and
      charging infrastructure that can easily be advanced to account for
      congestion contribution (instead of data volume as in many current
      deployments) and that could thus provide incentives for CONEX
      adoption and sender behavior.

   Well integrated overall system:  3GPP specification cover many parts
      of the overall system, including (for example) ECN usage by mobile
      terminals.  It would thus be quite feasible to introduce CONEX to
      such networks (without requiring CONEX support in non-3GPP
      networks) by specifying its detailed usage in the corresponding
      specifications.

   Frequent usage of gateways and proxies  It is quite common that
      actual deployments employ proxy caches, TCP proxies etc., which
      introduces additional options for an initial deployment (for
      instance by only modifying proxy TCP senders at a very early
      phase).

   The EPS architecture and its standardized interfaces are depicted in
   Figure 3.  The EPS provides IP connectivity to UEs (user equipment,
   i.e., mobile nodes) and access to operator services, such as global
   Internet access and voice communications.  The EPS comprises the
   access (evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network, E-UTRAN) and
   the core network (Evolved Packet Core, EPC -- all network elements
   except the E-UTRAN).  QoS is supported through an EPS bearer concept,
   providing hierarchical bindings within the network.  Please see
   [conex-mobile] for a detailed description of the individual elements.

   Figure 3 does not only depict data path elements but also mobility
   management, home subscriber servers (HSS) etc, distinguishing home
   networks and visited networks.  Figure 4 depicts a simplified
   network, focusing on data path elements only.

   In Figure 4 depicts a fairly simple deployment scenario, where CONEX
   is supported by servers for sending data (here: web servers in the
   Internet and caches in an operator's network) but not by UEs (neither
   for receiving nor sending).  An operator who chooses to run a
   policing function on the network ingress (e.g., on the P-GW) can
   still benefit from congestion exposure without requiring any change
   on UEs.

               Figure 4: CONEX support on servers and caches

   Logical CONEX functions would be mapped to network elements as
   follows:

   CONEX sender:  Web cache

   (Unmodified) receiver:  UE

   Policer:  P-GW

   Audit function:  eNB (optional, since operator controls sender)

4.2.1.  CONEX Functions in a Mobile Network Scenario

   In a mobile network, shared congestion can occur at different places,
   i.e., in the radio access network, on backhaul links, and in the core
   network.

   In this specific scenario, we assume that not all downlink traffic is
   CONEX-enabled, but that all (TCP) traffic that originates from the

Internet-Draft      Initial ConEx Deployment Examples         March 2012


   operators web cache is.

   Assuming unmodified receivers (UEs) the main CONEX function that is
   of interest in this scenario is congestion accountability for web
   traffic: a policing entity on the P-GW would be able to account for
   congestion contribution for downlink web traffic per user -- and
   possibly transfer corresponding information to charging.  (Different
   operator policies are possible -- for instance, it is also possible
   to police traffic more strictly, after a certain congestion
   contribution budget has been used in a accounting period.)

   Congestion exposure could also be used for traffic offload decisions,
   for example when downstream entities detect upstream congestion (in
   the core network).

   Moreover, congestion exposure could also be used in longer timer
   frame network management applications, i.e., downstream nodes in the
   network access network could report on upstream vs downstream
   congestion statistics on aggregated flows to assist performance
   optimizations, network planning etc.

4.2.2.  Incentives to Unilaterally Deploy CONEX in a Mobile Operator
        Network

   In mobile networks, both mobile terminals and mobile network
   equipment are standardised by the 3GPP.  This represents a much more
   centralised standardisation model, where if the 3GPP were to adopt
   the ConEx protocol, it might mandate ConEx implementation for
   compliant equipment.  Initially 3GPP might mandate ConEx only in user
   equipment, then each operator could choose (or not) to use ConEx
   information for traffic management.  This would also have the
   interesting side-effect of making ConEx mode widely available outside
   cellular networks, given 3GPP user equipment roams elsewhere.

   The comparatively non-invasive addition of CONEX support described in
   the previous section enables operators to add CONEX-based congestion
   accountability for a considerable fraction of the traffic (all
   cacheable web traffic).  It is independent of other operators and
   independent of other forms of congestion management (DPI-based for
   example).  But compared to other forms of congestion management, this
   approach does not require DPI, and it can be extended to other
   traffic types (in addition to HTTP) in a later deployment phase.  The
   existing policy and charging infrastructure can be leveraged.

4.3.  Scenario Internal to a Multi-Tenant Data Centre

   A number of companies offer hosting of virtual machines on their data
   centre infrastructure--so-called infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

   A set amount of processing power, memory, storage and network are
   offered.  Although processing power, memory and storage are
   relatively simple to allocate on the 'pay as you go' basis that has
   become common, the network is less easy to allocate given it is a
   naturally distributed system.

   The design involves the following elements, all involving changes
   solely in the hypervisor or operating systems, not network switches:

   o  A bulk congestion policing function to police all the traffic from
      a VM into the network (similar to [CongPol]), implemented as a
      shim in the hypervisor;

      A customer may run virtual machines on multiple physical nodes, in
      which case the data centre operator would ensure that it deployed
      a policer in the hypervisor on each node where the customer was
      running a VM, at the time the each VM was instantiated.The DC
      operator would arrange for them to collectively enforce the per-
      customer congestion allowance, as a distributed policer.

   o  A function to distribute a customer's tokens to the policer
      associated with each of the customer's VMs.  This could be similar
      to the distributed rate limiting of [DRL]]), or a logically
      centralised bucket of congestion tokens could be used with simple
      1-1 communication between it and the local token bucket in the
      hypervisor under each VM.  Importantly, traditional bit-rate
      tokens cannot simply be reassigned from one VM to another without
      implications on the balance of network loading (requiring operator
      intervention each time), whereas congestion tokens can be freely
      reassigned between different VMs, because a congestion token is
      equivalent at any place or time in a network;

   o  Reinsertion of congestion feedback at the sending side, which may
      be implemented:

      *  either as a shim in both sending and receiving hypervisors
         using edge-to-edge feedback (as in Seawall [Seawall]).

      *  or in the sending operating system using the congestion
         exposure protocol (ConEx [ConEx-Abstract-Mech]);

      If the Seawall option is used, a feedback proxy will also be
      required as a shim in the hypervisor at the receiver.  This passes
      congestion feedback that the network operator can trust to the
      sending hypervisor, by creating a tunnel between the hypervisors.
      Seawall uses a local variant of the Internet Protocol within the
      data centre to implement this tunnel.

Internet-Draft      Initial ConEx Deployment Examples         March 2012


      If the ConEx option is used, a congestion audit function will also
      be required as a shim in the hypervisor (or container) layer where
      data leaves the network and enters the receiving host.  The ConEx
      option is only applicable if the guest OS at the sender has been
      modified to send ConEx markings in IPv6 using [conex-destopt].  In
      addition, the ConEx options could be encoded in the IPv4 header by
      hiding them within the packet ID field as described in
      [intarea-ipv4-id-reuse].

   o  Network switches would not need any modification.  However, audit
      would be easier if switches supported ECN.  Ideally data centre
      TCP could be used as well, although not essential.  DCTCP is based
      on ECN and designed for data centres.  DCTCP involves a more
      aggressive AQM in layer 3 switches with a shallow step threshold
      for ECN marking.  DCTCP also requires modified sender and receiver
      TCP algorithms.

4.3.1.  Incremental Deployment of ConEx Scenario in a Multi-Tenant Data
        Centre

   The Seawall option above is a more processing intensive change to the
   hypervisors, but it can be deployed unilaterally by the data centre
   operator in al hypervisors (or containers).

   The ConEx option above is only applicable if a particular guest OS
   supports the marking of outgoing packets with ConEx markings.

   A simple filter could be installed in each hypervisor to allow ConEx
   packets through into the data centre network without going through
   the SeaWall tunnel structure, while non-ConEx packets could be
   tunnelled as per SeaWall.  This would provide an incremental
   deployment scenario with the best of both worlds: it would work for
   unmodified guest OSs, but for guest OSs with ConEx support, it would
   require less processing (therefore being faster) and not require a
   duplicate feedback channel between hypervisors.
