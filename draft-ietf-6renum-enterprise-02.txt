1. Introduction 

   IPv6 site renumbering is considered difficult. Network managers might 
   prefer to use Provider Independent (PI) addressing for IPv6 to 
   attempt to minimize the need for future renumbering. However, 
   widespread use of PI may create very serious BGP4 scaling problems  
   and PI space is not always available for enterprises according to the 
   RIR (Regional Internet Registry) policies. It is thus desirable to 
   develop mechanisms and practice guidelines that could make 
   renumbering a simpler process to reduce demand for IPv6 PI spaces.  

   This document undertakes scenario descriptions, including 
   documentation of current capabilities and existing BCPs, for 
   enterprise networks. It takes [RFC5887] and other relevant documents 
   as the primary input. 

   The IPv4 and IPv6 are logically separated from the perspective of 
   renumbering, regardless of overlapping of the IPv4/IPv6 networks or 
   devices. This document focuses on IPv6 only, by leaving IPv4 out of 
   scope. Dual-stack network or IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios are out 
   of scope, too.  

   This document focuses on enterprise network renumbering, though most 
   of the analysis is also applicable to ISP network renumbering. 
   Renumbering in home networks is considered out of scope, though it 
   may also benefit from the analysis in this document. 

   The concept of enterprise network and a typical network illustration 
   are introduced first. Then, according to the different stages of 
   renumbering events, considerations and best current practices are 
   described in three categories: during network design, for preparation 
   of renumbering, and during renumbering operation.  

2. Enterprise Network Illustration for Renumbering 

   An Enterprise Network as defined in [RFC4057] is: a network that has 
   multiple internal links, one or more router connections to one or 
   more Providers, and is actively managed by a network operations 
   entity. 

   The enterprise network architecture is illustrated in the figure 
   below. Those entities relevant to renumbering are highlighted. 

   Address reconfiguration is fulfilled either by DHCPv6 or ND  
   protocols. During the renumbering event, the DNS records need to be

   synchronized while routing tables, ACLs and IP filtering tables in 
   various devices also need to be updated, too. 

   Static address issue is described in a dedicated draft  
   [I-D.ietf-6renum-static-problem].

   It is assumed that IPv6 enterprise networks are IPv6-only, or dual-
   stack in which a logical IPv6 plane is independent from IPv4. The 
   complicated IPv4/IPv6 co-existence scenarios are out of scope. 

   This document focuses on the unicast addresses; site-local, link-
   local, multicast and anycast addresses are out of scope. 

3. Enterprise Network Renumbering Scenario Categories 

   In this section, we divide enterprise network renumbering scenarios 
   into two categories defined by external and internal network factors, 
   which require renumbering for different reasons. 

3.1. Renumbering Caused by External Network Factors 

   The most influential external network factor is the uplink ISP. 
 
 
Jiang, et al.              March 04, 2013                     [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-6renum-enterprise-02.txt    Septermber 2012 
    

   o The enterprise network switches to a new ISP. Of course, the 
      prefixes received from different ISPs are different. This is the 
      most common scenario. 
       
      Whether there is an overlap time between the old and new ISPs 
      would also influence the possibility whether the enterprise can 
      fulfill renumbering without a flag day [RFC4192]. 

   o The renumbering event may be initiated by receiving new prefixes 
      from the same uplink. This might happen if the enterprise network 
      is switched to a different location within the network topology of 
      the same ISP due to various considerations, such as commercial, 
      performance or services reasons, etc. Alternatively, the ISP 
      itself might be renumbered due to topology changes or migration to 
      a different or additional prefix. These ISP renumbering events 
      would initiate enterprise network renumbering events, of course. 

   o The enterprise network adds new uplink(s) for multihoming purposes. 
      This may not be a typical renumbering case because the original 
      addresses will not be changed. However, initial numbering may be 
      considered as a special renumbering event. The enterprise network 
      removes uplink(s) or old prefixes. 

3.2. Renumbering caused by Internal Network Factors 

   o As companies split, merge, grow, relocate or reorganize, the 
      enterprise network architectures may need to be re-built. This 
      will trigger the internal renumbering. 

   o The enterprise network may proactively adopt a new address scheme, 
      for example by switching to a new transition mechanism or stage of 
      a transition plan. 

   o The enterprise network may reorganize its topology or subnets. 

4. Network Renumbering Considerations and Best Current Practices 

   In order to carry out renumbering in an enterprise network, 
   systematic planning and administrative preparation are needed. 
   Carefully planning and preparation could make the renumbering process 
   smoother. 

   This section recommends some solutions or strategies for the 
   enterprise renumbering, chosen among existing mechanisms. There are 
   known gaps analyzed by [I-D.ietf-6renum-gap-analysis]. If these gaps 
   are filled in the future, the enterprise renumbering may be processed 
   more automatically, with fewer issues.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-6renum-enterprise-02.txt    Septermber 2012 
    

4.1. Considerations and Best Current Practices during Network Design 

   This section describes the consideration or issues relevant to 
   renumbering that a network architect should carefully plan when 
   building or designing a new network. 

      - Prefix Delegation 

      In a large or a multi-site enterprise network, the prefix should 
      be carefully managed, particularly during renumbering events. 
      Prefix information needs to be delegated from router to router. 
      The DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation options [RFC3633] and 
      [RFC6603] provide a mechanism for automated delegation of IPv6 
      prefixes. Normally, DHCPv6 PD options are used between the 
      internal enterprise routers, for example, a router receives 
      prefix(es) from its upstream router (may be a border gateway or 
      edge router .etc) through DHCPv6 PD options and then advertise it 
      (them) to the local hosts through RA messages. 

      - Usage of FQDN 

      In general, Fully-Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) are recommended 
      to be used to configure network connectivity, such as tunnels, 
      whenever possible. The capability to use FQDNs as endpoint names 
      has been standardized in several RFCs, such as [RFC5996], although 
      many system/network administrators do not realize that it is there 
      and works well as a way to avoid manual modification during 
      renumbering. 

      Service Location Protocol [RFC2608] and multicast DNS with SRV 
      records for service discovery can reduce the number of places that 
      IP addresses need to be configured. But it should be noted that 
      multicast DNS is link-local only. 

      - Usage of ULA 

      Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) are defined in [RFC4193] as 
      provider-independent prefixes, and they are globally unique to 
      avoid collision. For enterprise networks, using ULA along with PA 
      can provide a logically local routing plane separated from the 
      globally routing plane. The benefit is to ensure stable and 
      specific local communication regardless of the ISP uplink failure. 
      This benefit is especially meaningful for renumbering. It mainly 
      includes three use cases as the following. 

      When renumbering, as RFC4192 suggested, it has a period to keep 
      using the old prefix(es) before the new prefix(es) is(are) stable. 
 
 
Jiang, et al.              March 04, 2013                     [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-6renum-enterprise-02.txt    Septermber 2012 
    

      In the process of adding new prefix(es) and deprecating old 
      prefix(es), it is not easy to keep the local communication immune 
      of global routing plane change. If we use ULA for the local 
      communication, the separated local routing plane can isolate the 
      affecting by global routing change. 

      Enterprise administrators may want to avoid the need to renumber 
      their internal-only, private nodes when they have to renumber the 
      PA addresses of the whole network because of changing ISPs, ISPs 
      restructure their address allocations, or any other reasons. In 
      these situations, ULA is an effective tool for the internal-only 
      nodes. 

      For multicast, ULA may be a way of avoiding renumbering from 
      having an impact on multicast. In most deployments multicast is 
      only used internally (intra-domain), and the addresses used for 
      multicast sources and Rendezvous-Points need not be reachable nor 
      routable externally. Hence one may at least internally make use of 
      ULA for multicast specific infrastructure. 

      - Address Types 

      This document focuses on the dynamically-configured global unicast 
      addresses in enterprise networks. They are the targets of 
      renumbering events. 

      Manual-configured addresses are not scalable in medium to large 
      sites, hence are out of scope. Manually-configured addresses/hosts 
      should be avoided as much as possible. 

      - Address configuration models 

      In IPv6 networks, there are two auto-configuration models for 
      address assignment: Stateless Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC, 
      [RFC4862]) by Neighbor Discovery (ND, [RFC4861]) and stateful 
      address configuration by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for 
      IPv6 (DHCPv6, [RFC3315]). In the latest work, DHCPv6 can also 
      support host-generated address model by assigning a prefix through 
      DHCPv6 messages [I-D.ietf-dhc-host-gen-id]. 

      ND is considered easier to renumber by broadcasting a Router 
      Advertisement message with a new prefix. DHCPv6 can also trigger 
      the renumbering process by sending unicast RECONFIGURE messages, 
      though it may cause a large number of interactions between hosts 
      and DHCPv6 server. 


 
 
Jiang, et al.              March 04, 2013                     [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-6renum-enterprise-02.txt    Septermber 2012 
    

      This document has no preference between ND and DHCPv6 address 
      configuration models. It is network architects' job to decide 
      which configuration model is employed. But it should be noticed 
      that using DHCPv6 and ND together within one network, especially 
      in one subnet, may cause operational issues. For example, some 
      hosts use DHCPv6 as the default configuration model while some use 
      ND. Then the hosts' address configuration model depends on the 
      policies of operating systems and cannot be controlled by the 
      network. Section 5.1 of [I-D.ietf-6renum-gap-analysis] discusses 
      more details on this topic. So, in general, this document 
      recommends using DHCPv6/SLAAC independently in different subnets. 

      However, since DHCPv6 is also used to configure many other network 
      parameters, there are ND and DHCPv6 co-existence scenarios. 
      Combinations of address configuration models may coexist within a 
      single enterprise network. [I-D.ietf-savi-mix] provides 
      recommendations to avoid collisions and to review collision 
      handling in such scenarios. 

      - DNS 

      It is recommended that the site have an automatic and systematic 
      procedure for updating/synchronizing its DNS records, including 
      both forward and reverse mapping [RFC2874]. A manual on-demand 
      updating model does not scale, and increases the chance of errors. 

      Although the A6 DNS record model [RFC2874] was designed for easier 
      renumbering, it has a lot of unsolved technical issues [RFC3364]. 
      Therefore, it has been moved to experimental status [RFC3363], and 
      will move to historic status by [RFC6563] (Moving A6 to Historic 
      Status). So A6 is not recommended. 

      In order to simplify the operation procedure, the network 
      architect should combine the forward and reverse DNS updates in a 
      single procedure. 

      Often, a small site depends on its ISP's DNS system rather than 
      maintaining its own. When renumbering, this requires 
      administrative coordination between the site and its ISP.  

      The DNS synchronization may be completed through the Secure DNS 
      Dynamic Update [RFC3007]. Dynamic DNS update can be provided by 
      the DHCPv6 client or by the server on behalf of individual hosts. 
      [RFC4704] defined a DHCPv6 option to be used by DHCPv6 clients and 
      servers to exchange information about the client's FQDN and about 
      who has the responsibility for updating the DNS with the 
      associated AAAA and PTR RRs. For example, if a client wants the 
 
 
Jiang, et al.              March 04, 2013                     [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-6renum-enterprise-02.txt    Septermber 2012 
    

      server to update the FQDN-address mapping in the DNS server, it 
      can include the Client FQDN option with proper settings in the 
      SOLICIT with Rapid Commit, REQUEST, RENEW, and REBIND message 
      originated by the client. When DHCPv6 server gets this option, it 
      can use the dynamic DNS update on behalf of the client. In this 
      document, we promote to support this FQDN option. But since it's a 
      DHCPv6 option, it implies that only the DHCP-managed networks are 
      suitable for this operation. In SLAAC mode, sometimes hosts also 
      need to register addresses on a registration server, which could 
      in fact be a DHCPv6 server (as described in  
      [I-D.ietf-dhc-addr-registration]); then the server would update 
      corresponding DNS records. 

      - Security 

      Any automatic renumbering scheme has a potential exposure to 
      hijacking. Malicious entity in the network can forge prefixes to 
      renumber the hosts. So proper network security mechanisms are 
      needed.  

      For ND, Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND, [RFC3971]) is a possible 
      solution, but it is complex and there's almost no real deployment 
      so far. Comparing the non-trivial deployment of SEND, RA guard 
      [RFC6105] is a light-weight alternative, which focuses on rogue 
      router advertisements proof in a L2 network. However, it also 
      hasn't been widely deployed since it hasn't been published for 
      long.  

      For DHCPv6, there are built-in secure mechanisms (like Secure 
      DHCPv6 [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6]), and authentication of DHCPv6 
      messages [RFC3315] could be utilized. But these security 
      mechanisms also haven't been verified by wide real deployment. 

      - Miscellaneous 

      A site or network should also avoid embedding addresses from other 
      sites or networks in its own configuration data. Instead, the 
      Fully-Qualified Domain Names should be used. Thus, these 
      connections can survive after renumbering events at other sites. 
      This also applies to host-based connectivities. 

4.2. Considerations and Best Current Practices for the Preparation of 
   Renumbering 

   In ND, it is not possible to reduce a prefix's lifetime to below two 
   hours. So, renumbering should not be an unplanned sudden event. This 
   issue could only be avoided by early planning and preparation. 
 
 
Jiang, et al.              March 04, 2013                     [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-6renum-enterprise-02.txt    Septermber 2012 
    

   This section describes several recommendations for the preparation of 
   enterprise renumbering event. By adopting these recommendations, a 
   site could be renumbered more easily. However, these recommendations 
   might increase the daily traffic, server load, or burden of network 
   operation. Therefore, only those networks that are expected to be 
   renumbered soon or very frequently should adopt these  
   recommendations, with balanced consideration between daily cost and 
   renumbering cost. 

      - Reduce the address preferred time or valid time or both. 

      Long-lifetime addresses may cause issues for renumbering events. 
      Particularly, some offline hosts may reconnect using these 
      addresses after renumbering events. Shorter preferred lifetimes 
      with relatively long valid lifetimes may allow short transition 
      periods for renumbering events and avoid frequent address  
      renewals. 

      - Reduce the DNS record TTL on the local DNS server. 

      The DNS AAAA resource record TTL on the local DNS server should be 
      manipulated to ensure that stale addresses are not cached. 

      - Reduce the DNS configuration lifetime on the hosts. 

      Since the DNS server could be renumbered as well, the DNS 
      configuration lifetime on the hosts should also be reduced if 
      renumbering events are expected. In ND, The DNS configuration can 
      be done through reducing the lifetime value in RDNSS option 
      [RFC6106]. In DHCPv6, the DNS configuration option specified in 
      [RFC3646] doesn't provide lifetime attribute, but we can reduce 
      the DHCPv6 client lease time to achieve similar effect. 

      - Identify long-living sessions 

      Any applications which maintain very long transport connections 
      (hours or days) should be identified in advance, if possible. Such 
      applications will need special handling during renumbering, so it 
      is important to know that they exist. 

4.3. Considerations and Best Current Practices during Renumbering 
   Operation 

   Renumbering events are not instantaneous events. Normally, there is a 
   transition period, in which both the old prefix and the new prefix 
   are used in the site. Better network design and management, better 

 
 
Jiang, et al.              March 04, 2013                    [Page 10] 

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-6renum-enterprise-02.txt    Septermber 2012 
    

   pre-preparation and longer transition period are helpful to reduce 
   the issues during renumbering operation. 

      - Within/without a flag day 

      As is described in [RFC4192], "a 'flag day' is a procedure in 
      which the network, or a part of it, is changed during a planned 
      outage, or suddenly, causing an outage while the network 
      recovers." 

      If renumbering event is processed within a flag day, the network 
      service/connectivity will be unavailable for a period until the 
      renumbering event is completed. It is efficient and provides 
      convenience for network operation and management. But network 
      outage is usually unacceptable for end users and enterprises. A 
      renumbering procedure without a flag day provides smooth address 
      switching, but much more operational complexity and difficulty is 
      introduced. 

      - Transition period 

      If renumbering transition period is longer than all address 
      lifetimes, after which the address leases expire, each host will 
      automatically pick up its new IP address. In this case, it would 
      be the DHCPv6 server or Router Advertisement itself that 
      automatically accomplishes client renumbering. 

      Address deprecation should be associated with the deprecation of 
      associated DNS records. The DNS records should be deprecated as 
      early as possible, before the addresses themselves. 

      - Network initiative enforced renumbering 

      If the network has to enforce renumbering before address leases 
      expire, the network should initiate DHCPv6 RECONFIGURE messages. 
      For some operating systems such as Windows 7, if the hosts receive 
      RA messages with ManagedFlag=0, they'll release the DHCPv6 
      addresses and do SLAAC according to the prefix information in the 
      RA messages, so this could be another enforcement method for some 
      specific scenarios. 

      - Impact to branch/main sites  

      Renumbering in main/branch site may cause impact on branch/main 
      site communication. The routes, ingress filtering of site's 
      gateways, and DNS may need to be updated. This needs careful 
      planning and organizing.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-6renum-enterprise-02.txt    Septermber 2012 
    

      - DNS record update and DNS configuration on hosts 

      DNS records on the local DNS server should be updated if hosts are 
      renumbered. If the site depends on ISP's DNS system, it should 
      report the new host's DNS records to its ISP. During the 
      transition period, both old and new DNS records are valid. If the 
      TTLs of DNS records are shorter than the transition period, an 
      administrative operation may not be necessary. 

      DNS configuration on hosts should be updated if local recursive 
      DNS servers are renumbered. During the transition period, both old 
      and new DNS server addresses may co-exist on the hosts. If the 
      lifetime of DNS configuration is shorter than the transition 
      period, name resolving failure may be reduced to minimum. A 
      notification mechanism may be needed to indicate to the hosts that 
      a renumbering event of local recursive DNS happens or is going to 
      take place. 

      - Tunnel concentrator renumbering 

      A tunnel concentrator itself might be renumbered. This change 
      should be reconfigured in relevant hosts or routers, unless the 
      configuration of tunnel concentrator was based on FQDN. However, 
      even if FQDN is used, some other tunnel-relevant configuration may 
      still exist, for example IPSec, so fail in renumbering. 

      - Connectivity session survivability 

      During the renumbering operations, connectivity sessions in IP 
      layer would break if the old address is deprecated before the 
      session ends. However, the upper layer sessions may survive by 
      using session survivability technologies, such as SHIM6 [RFC5533]. 
      As mentioned above, some long-living applications may need to be 
      handled specially. 

5. Security Considerations 

   As noted, a site that is listed by IP address in a black list can 
   escape that list by renumbering itself. 

   Any automatic renumbering scheme has a potential exposure to 
   hijacking. Proper network security mechanisms are needed. Although 
   there are existing security mechanisms such as SEND, RA guard, secure 
   DHCPv6 etc., they haven't been widely deployed and haven't been 
   verified whether they are suitable for ensuring security while not 
   bringing too much operational complexity and cost.

   Dynamic DNS update may bring risk of DoS attack to the DNS server. So 
   along with the update authentication, session filtering/limitation 
   may also be needed. 

   The "make-before-break" approach of [RFC4192] requires the routers 
   keep advertising the old prefixes for some time. But if the ISP 
   changes the prefixes very frequently, the co-existence of old and new 
   prefixes may cause potential risk to the enterprise routing system  
   since the old address relevant route path may already invalid and the 
   routing system just doesn't know it. However, normally enterprise 
   scenarios don't involve the extreme situation. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This draft does not request any IANA action.
