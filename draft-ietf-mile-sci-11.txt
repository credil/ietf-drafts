Internet-Draft                  IODEF-SCI                       Nov 2013


1.  Introduction

   The number of cyber attacks is growing day-by-day, and incident
   information needs to be reported, exchanged, and shared among
   organizations in order to cope with the situation.  IODEF is one of
   the tools already in use that enables such an exchange.

   To more efficiently run cybersecurity operations, information
   exchanged between organizations needs to be machine-readable.  IODEF
   provides a means to describe the incident information, but it often
   needs to include various non-structured types of incident-related
   data in order to convey more specific details about what is occuring.
   Further structure within IODEF increases the machine-readability of
   the document thus providing a means for better automating certain
   cybersecurity operations.

   Within the security community there exist various means for
   specifying structured descriptions of cybersecurity information such
   as [CAPEC][CCE][CCSS][CEE][CPE][CVE][CVRF][CVSS][CWE][CWSS][MAEC]
   [OCIL][OVAL][SCAP][XCCDF].  Such structured descriptions facilitates
   a better understanding of an incident while enabling more streamlined
   automated cybersecurity operations.  Because of this, it would be
   beneficial to embed and convey these types of information inside
   IODEF documents.

   To enable that, this document extends IODEF to embed and convey
   various types of structured cybersecurity information.  Since IODEF
   defines a flexible and extensible format and supports a granular
   level of specificity, this document defines an extension to IODEF
   instead of defining a new report format.  For clarity, and to
   eliminate duplication, only the additional structures necessary for
   describing the exchange of such structured information are provided.


2.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document follows the one defined in RFC
   5070 [RFC5070].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability

   To maintain cybersecurity, organization needs to exchange
   cybersecurity information, which includes the following information:



Takahashi, et al.         Expires May 11, 2014                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  IODEF-SCI                       Nov 2013


   attack pattern, platform information, vulnerability and weakness,
   countermeasure instruction, computer event log, and the severity.
   IODEF provides a scheme to describe and exchange such information
   among interested parties.  However, it does not define the detailed
   formats to specify such information.

   On the other hand, there already exist structured and detailed
   formats for describing these types of information that can be used in
   facilitating such an exchange.  They are [CAPEC][CCE][CCSS][CEE][CPE]
   [CVE][CVRF][CVSS][CWE][CWSS][MAEC][OCIL][OVAL][SCAP][XCCDF].  By
   embedding them into the IODEF document, the document can convey more
   detailed contents to the receivers, and the document can be easily
   reused.

   The use of structured cybersecurity information formats facilitates
   more advanced cybersecurity operations on the receiver side.  Since
   the information is machine-readable, the data can be processed by
   computers thus allowing better automation of cybersecurity
   operations.

   For instance, an organization wishing to report a security incident
   wants to describe what vulnerability was exploited.  In this case the
   sender can simply use IODEF, where an XML-based [XML1.0] attack
   pattern record that follows the syntax and vocabulary defined by an
   industry specification is embedded, instead of describing everything
   in free form text.  The receiver can identify the needed details of
   the attack pattern by looking up some of the XML tags defined by the
   specification.  The receiver can accumulate the attack pattern record
   in its database and could distribute it to the interested parties as
   needed, all without needing human interventions.

   In another example, an administrator wishes to check the
   configuration of host computers in his organization.  He could send a
   query to software on the host computers which could automatically
   generate an XML-based software configuration description, embed it in
   an IODEF document, and send the resulting IODEF document back to the
   administrator for review and additional automated uses.


4.  Extension Definition

   This draft extends IODEF to embed structured cybersecurity
   information by introducing new classes, with which these types of
   information can be embedded inside IODEF document as element contents
   of AdditionalData and RecordItem classes.

4.1.  IANA Table for Structured Cybersecurity Information

   This extension embeds structured cybersecurity information defined by
   other specifications.  The list of supported specifications is
   managed by IANA, and this draft defines the needed field for the
   list's entry.

   Each entry has namespace [XMLNames], specification name, version,
   reference URI, and applicable classes for each specification.
   Arbitrary URIs that may help readers to understand the specification
   could be embedded inside the Reference URI field, but it is
   recommended that standard/informational URI describing the
   specification is prepared and is embedded here.

   The initial IANA table has only one entry, as below.


     Namespace:          http://xml/metadataSharing.xsd
     Specification Name: Malware Metadata Exchange Format
     Version:            1.2
     Reference URI:      http://standards.ieee.org/develop
                         /indconn/icsg/mmdef.html,
                         http://grouper.ieee.org/groups
                         /malware/malwg/Schema1.2/
     Applicable Classes: AttackPattern


   Note that the specification was developed by The Institute of
   Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Incorporated (IEEE), through
   the Industry Connections Security Group (ICSG) of its Standards
   Association.

   The table is to be managed by IANA following the allocation policy
   specified in Section 7.

   The SpecID attributes of extension classes (Section 4.5) must allow
   the values of the specifications' namespace fields, but otherwise,
   implementations are not required to support all specifications of the
   IANA table and may choose which specifications to support, though the
   specification listed in the initial table needs to be minimally
   supported, as described in Section 5.  In case an implementation
   received a data it does not support, it may expand its functionality
   by looking up the IANA table or notify the sender of its inability to
   parse the data.  Note that the look-up could be done manually or
   automatically, but automatic download of data from IANA's website is
   not recommended since it is not designed for mass retrieval of data
   by multiple devices.

4.2.  Extended Data Type: XMLDATA

   This extension inherits all of the data types defined in the IODEF
   model.  One data type is added: XMLDATA.  An embedded XML data is
   represented by the XMLDATA data type.  This type is defined as the
   extension to the iodef:ExtensionType [RFC5070], whose dtype attribute
   is set to "xml".

4.3.  Extending IODEF

   This draft defines eight extension classes, namely AttackPattern,
   Platform, Vulnerability, Scoring, Weakness, EventReport, Verification
   and Remediation.  Figure 1 describes the relationships between the
   IODEF Incident class [RFC5070] and the newly defined classes.  It is
   expressed in Unified Modeling Language (UML) syntax as with the RFC
   5070 [RFC5070].  The UML representation is for illustrative purposes
   only; elements are specified in XML as defined in Section 5.2.

   +---------------------+
   | New Class Name      |
   +---------------------+
   | ENUM SpecID         |<>--(0..*)-[ RawData ]
   | STRING ext-SpecID   |<>--(0..*)-[ Reference ]
   | STRING ContentID    |
   +---------------------+

                         Figure 2: Basic Structure

   Three attributes are defined as below.

   SpecID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  A specification's identifier that
      specifies the format of a structured cybersecurity information.
      The value should be chosen from the namespaces [XMLNames] listed
      in the IANA table (Section 4.1) or "private".  The value "private"
      is prepared for conveying structured information based on a format
      that is not listed in the table.  This is usually used for
      conveying data formatted according to an organization's private
      schema.  When the value "private" is used, ext-SpecID element MUST
      be used.

   ext-SpecID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  A specification's identifier that
      specifies the format of a structured cybersecurity information.
      This is usually used to support private schema that is not listed
      in the IANA table (Section 4.1).  This attribute MUST be used only
      when the value of SpecID element is "private."

   ContentID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An identifier of a structured
      information.  Depending on the extension classes, the content of
      the structured information differs.  This attribute enables IODEF
      documents to covey the identifier of a structured information
      instead of conveying the information itself.

   Likewise, three elements are defined as below.

   RawData:  Zero or more.  XMLDATA.  An XML of a structured
      information.  This is a complete document that is formatted
      according to the specification and its version identified by the
      SpecID/ext-SpecID.  When this element is used, writers/senders
      MUST ensure that the namespace specified by SpecID/ext-SpecID and
      the one used in the RawData element are consistent; if not, the
      namespace identified by SpecID SHOULD be preferred, and the
      inconsistency SHOULD be logged so a human can correct the problem.

Internet-Draft                  IODEF-SCI                       Nov 2013


   Reference:  Zero or more of iodef:Reference [RFC5070].  A reference
      to a structured information.  This element allows an IODEF
      document to include a link to a structured information instead of
      directly embedding it into a RawData element.

   Though ContentID, RawData, and Reference are optional attribute and
   elements, one of them MUST be used to convey structured information.
   Note that only one of them SHOULD be used to avoid confusing the
   receiver.

4.5.  Defining Extension Classes

   This draft defines the following seven extension classes.

4.5.1.  AttackPattern

   An AttackPattern is an extension class to the
   Incident.Method.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  It
   describes attack patterns of incidents or events.  It is recommended
   that Method class SHOULD contain the extension elements whenever
   available.  An AttackPattern class is structured as follows.


   +---------------------+
   | AttackPattern       |
   +---------------------+
   | ENUM SpecID         |<>--(0..*)-[ RawData ]
   | STRING ext-SpecID   |<>--(0..*)-[ Reference ]
   | STRING ContentID    |<>--(0..*)-[ Platform ]
   +---------------------+


                       Figure 3: AttackPattern class

   This class has the following attributes.

   SpecID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  See Section 4.4.

   ext-SpecID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  See Section 4.4.

   ContentID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An identifier of an attack pattern
      information.  See Section 4.4.

   Likewise, this class has the following elements.

Internet-Draft                  IODEF-SCI                       Nov 2013


   RawData:  Zero or more.  XMLDATA.  An XML of an attack pattern
      information.  See Section 4.4.

   Reference:  Zero or more.  A reference to an attack pattern
      information.  See Section 4.4.

   Platform:  Zero or more.  An identifier of software platform involved
      in the specific attack pattern.  See Section 4.5.2.

4.5.2.  Platform

   A Platform is an extension class that identifies a software platform.
   It is recommended that AttackPattern, Vulnerability, Weakness, and
   System classes contain the extension elements whenever available.  A
   Platform element is structured as follows.


   +---------------------+
   | Platform            |
   +---------------------+
   | ENUM SpecID         |<>--(0..*)-[ RawData ]
   | STRING ext-SpecID   |<>--(0..*)-[ Reference ]
   | STRING ContentID    |
   +---------------------+


                         Figure 4: Platform class

   This class has the following attributes.

   SpecID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  See Section 4.4.

   ext-SpecID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  See Section 4.4.

   ContentID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An identifier of a platform
      information.  See Section 4.4.

   Likewise, this class has the following elements.

   RawData:  Zero or more.  XMLDATA.  An XML of a platform information.
      See Section 4.4.

   Reference:  Zero or more.  A reference to a platform information.
      See Section 4.4.

4.5.3.  Vulnerability

   A Vulnerability is an extension class to the
   Incident.Method.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  The

5.  Mandatory to Implement features

   The implementation of this draft MUST be capable of sending and
   receiving the XML conforming to the specification listed in the
   initial IANA table described in Section 4.1 without error.  The
   receiver MUST be capable of validating received XML documents that
   are embedded inside that against their schemata.  Note that the
   receiver can look up the namespace in the IANA table to understand
   what specifications the embedded XML documents follows.

   For the purpose of facilitating the understanding of mandatory to
   implement features, the following subsections provide an XML
   conformant to this draft, and a schema for that.

5.1.  An Example XML

   An example IODEF document for checking implementation's MTI
   conformity is provided here.  The document carries MMDEF metadata.
   Note that the metadata is generated by genMMDEF [MMDEF] with EICAR
   [EICAR] files.  Implementations of this specification must be capable
   of parsing the example XML since MMDEF is specified as the draft's
   MTI specification.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a format for encoding a particular class of
   security incidents appropriate for exchange across organizations.  As
   merely a data representation, it does not directly introduce security
   issues.  However, it is guaranteed that parties exchanging instances
   of this specification will have certain concerns.  For this reason,
   the underlying message format and transport protocol used MUST ensure
   the appropriate degree of confidentiality, integrity, and
   authenticity for the specific environment.

   Organizations that exchange data using this document are URGED to
   develop operating procedures that document the following areas of

Internet-Draft                  IODEF-SCI                       Nov 2013


   concern.

6.1.  Transport-Specific Concerns

   The underlying messaging format and protocol used to exchange
   instances of the IODEF MUST provide appropriate guarantees of
   confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.  The use of a
   standardized security protocol is encouraged.  The Real-time Inter-
   network Defense (RID) protocol [RFC6045] and its associated transport
   binding [RFC6046] provide such security.

   The critical security concerns are that these structured information
   may be falsified or they may become corrupt during transit.  In areas
   where transmission security or secrecy is questionable, the
   application of a digital signature and/or message encryption on each
   report will counteract both of these concerns.  We expect that each
   exchanging organization will determine the need, and mechanism, for
   transport protection.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemata
   [XMLschemaPart1] [XMLschemaPart2] conforming to a registry mechanism
   described in [RFC3688].

   Registration request for the IODEF structured cybersecurity
   information extension namespace:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iodef-sci-1.0

      Registrant Contact: Refer here to the authors' addresses section
      of the document.

      XML: None.

   Registration request for the IODEF structured cybersecurity
   information extension XML schema:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef-sci-1.0

      Registrant Contact: Refer here to the authors' addresses section
      of the document.

      XML: Refer here to the XML Schema in Section 5.2.

   This memo creates the following registry for IANA to manage:

Internet-Draft                  IODEF-SCI                       Nov 2013


      Name of the registry: "Structured Cybersecurity Information (SCI)
      specifications"

      Name of its parent registry: "Incident Object Description Exchange
      Format (IODEF)"

      URL address of the registry: http://www.iana.org/assignments/iodef

      Namespace details: A registry entry for a Structured Cybersecurity
      Information Specification (SCI specification) consists of:

         Namespace: A URI [RFC3986] that is the XML namespace name used
         by the registered SCI specification.

         Specification Name: A string containing the spelled-out name of
         the SCI specification in human-readable form.

         Reference URI: A list of one or more of the URIs [RFC3986] from
         which the registered specification can be obtained.  The
         registered specification MUST be readily and publicly available
         from that URI.

         Applicable Classes: A list of one or more of the extension
         classes specified in Section 4.5 of this document.  The
         registered SCI specification MUST only be used with the
         extension classes in the registry entry.

      Information that must be provided to assign a new value: The above
      list of information.

      Fields to record in the registry: Namespace/Specification Name/
      Version/Reference URI/Applicable Classes.  Note that it is not
      necessary to include defining reference for all assignments in
      this new registry.

      Initial registry contents: only one entry with the following
      values.

         Namespace: http://xml/metadataSharing.xsd

         Specification Name: Malware Metadata Exchange Format

         Version: 1.2

         Reference URI: http://standards.ieee.org/develop/indconn/icsg/
         mmdef.html,http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/malware/malwg/
         Schema1.2/

         Applicable Classes: AttackPattern

      Allocation Policy: Specification Required (which includes Expert
      Review) [RFC5226].

   The Designated Expert is expected to consult with the mile (Managed
   Incident Lightweight Exchange) working group or its successor if any
   such WG exists (e.g., via email to the working group's mailing list).
   The Designated Expert is expected to retrieve the SCI specification
   from the provided URI in order to check the public availability of
   the specification and verify the correctness of the URI.  An
   important responsibility of the Designated Expert is to ensure that
   the registered Applicable Classes are appropriate for the registered
   SCI specification.
