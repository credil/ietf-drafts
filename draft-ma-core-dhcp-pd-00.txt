                  dhcp option for CoAP Proxy Discovery
                        draft-ma-core-dhcp-pd-00

Abstract

   CoAP utilizes DNS to discovery the IP address of the CoAP server.
   However DNS is heavy for the most resource constrained end-points.
   In this case the assistance from CoAP proxy or research directory
   (RD) is needed for CoAP transaction.  This specification proposes to
   define one new dhcp option for proxy/RD discovery for the most
   resource constrained end-points.

Internet-Draft          dhcp COAP Proxy Discovery               Oct 2011


1.  Introduction

   CoAP [I-D.ietf-core-coap] is a RESTful protocol designed for
   constrained devices.  The ultimate goal of CoAP is to enable the "Web
   of Things" concept, which connects the smart sensor network with the
   global internet.

   CoAP utilizes DNS for CoAP server IP address discovery.  However in
   some circumstances, DNS is heavy to be implemented in the resource
   constrained nodes.  In this case the assistance from CoAP proxy is
   needed for CoAP transaction.

   Also in many M2M scenarios, direct discovery of resources is not
   practical due to sleeping nodes, disperse networks, or networks where
   multicast traffic is inefficient.  These problems can be solved by
   employing an entity called a Resource Directory
   (RD)[I-D.shelby-core-resource-directory], which hosts descriptions of
   resources held on other servers, allowing lookups to be performed for
   those resources .

   Before the CoAP sensor makes use of the CoAP proxy or RD, it must
   know the location of the proxy or RD.  There can be multiple ways to
   discover the proxy's location, including both static and dynamic
   methods.  Static configuration is a straightforward way for the
   client to access the server.  However, in many situations, static
   configuration is not enough to meet the requirements.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]


2.  dhcp option for proxy discovery

   dhcp [RFC2131] provides dynamic methods to deliver configuration
   information to the end node. dhcp options [RFC2132] are defined to
   specify server information.  This document specifies one new dhcp
   option for CoAP proxy/rd discovery.

   The CoAP proxy/rd option specifies a list of CoAP proxy or Research
   Directory servers available to the client.  Servers SHOULD be listed
   in order of preference.

   The code for the name server option is x.  The minimum length for
   this option is 4 octets, and the length MUST always be a multiple of
   4.
