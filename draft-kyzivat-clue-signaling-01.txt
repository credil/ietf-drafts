Internet-Draft               CLUE Signaling                February 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies how signaling is conducted in the course of
   CLUE sessions.  This includes how SIP/SDP signaling is applied to
   CLUE sessions as well as defining a CLUE-specific signaling protocol
   that complements SIP/SDP and supports negotiation of CLUE application
   level data.

   [Yes, this is a dup of the abstract for now.  Eventually it should
   say more.]


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document draws liberally from the terminology defined in the
   CLUE Framework [I-D.ietf-clue-framework].

   Other terms introduced here:

   CLUE Channel:  A reliable, bidirectional, transport mechanism used to
      convey CLUE messages.  A CLUE channel consists of one SCTP stream
      in each direction over a DTLS/SCTP session.



3.  CLUE-Specific Signaling Protocol

   The CLUE Framework [I-D.ietf-clue-framework] mentions a CLUE-specific
   protocol for the exchange of ADVERTISEMENT and CONFIGURE messages,
   but gives little detail.  The Data Model
   [I-D.presta-clue-data-model-schema] specifies a model and XML
   representation for CLUE-related data, but doesn't currently specify
   exactly what data belongs in each message, or how messages are
   sequenced.  This document provides the detail missing from those
   documents.

3.1.  CLUE Messages

   CLUE messages are encoded in XML.  The Data Model
   [I-D.presta-clue-data-model-schema] defines many/most of the elements
   from which CLUE messages are composed.  The content of each
   individual CLUE message could be defined by reference to an XML
   element type defined in the Data Model.  Or this document could
   itself define an XML element type for each message, with much of the

Internet-Draft               CLUE Signaling                February 2013


   content of those elements being drawn from the Data Model.  Which
   approach to follow is TBD.

3.1.1.  ADVERTISEMENT Message

   Most of the content needed for the ADVERTISEMENT message is already
   defined in the Data Model.  But the Data Model has't been constructed
   with that in mind.  So either the Data Model needs revision with a
   focus on the needs of signaling, or else additional schema is needed
   here.

3.1.2.  CONFIGURE Message

   The CONFIGURE message should probably also be based primarily on data
   elements defined in the Data Model.

   The CONFIGURE message must make reference (explicitly or implicitly)
   to the ADVERTISEMENT message on which it is based.  The mechanism for
   doing this must be specified.

3.1.3.  Stand-alone messages or deltas?

   Each message exchanged within a CLUE session could contain a complete
   description of the state it wishes to achieve.  Or each message could
   describe just the changes that it wishes to make to the current
   state.  Or the protocol could support both message forms.  Which
   direction to pursue is TBD.

   [Paul: while this does need to be decided, it is fundamentally just
   an optimization.  IMO it does not have major impact on the other
   parts of this document, so I would prefer to continue deferring it
   until we are so far along with the remainder of the document that we
   can no longer defer it.]

3.1.4.  other

3.2.  Message Acknowledgement

   The CLUE channel is reliable, so there is no need for acknowledgement
   to guarantee delivery.  But there is still a need for application-to-
   application acknowledgement to report that the message has been
   received, parsed, and found to be of an acceptable format.  One
   possibility is to introduce separate ACK and/or NAK messages.
   Another possibility is to add a confirmation element to each CLUE
   message, so that confirmation can be piggybacked on the basic
   messages.  Something concrete needs to be proposed.

3.3.  Message Sequencing

   There is a very basic introduction to this topic in section 9.4
   (Message Flow) of the CLUE Framework [I-D.ietf-clue-framework].  That
   still mentions the Consumer Capability message, which we have decided
   to drop.  Without that it would look like:

            Media Consumer                         Media Provider
            --------------                         ------------
                  |                                     |
                  |<----- ADVERTISEMENT message --------|
                  |                                     |
                  |                                     |
                  |-------- CONFIGURE message --------->|
                  |                                     |

   But we need much more than this, to show multiple CONFIGUREs per
   ADVERTISEMENT, interleaving of ADVERTISEMENTs and CONFIGUREs in both
   directions, etc.

   Message sequencing needs to be described at two levels:
   o  Basic sequencing of the CLUE messages themselves, without regard
      for the SIP/SDP signaling that may be going on at the same time.
      This is useful to cover the basic concepts.  That should be
      covered in this section.  It provides context for understanding
      the more detailed treatment later.

      This could include some simple state machines.

   o  In reality there is a complex dependency between CLUE signaling
      and SDP Offer/Answer exchanges carried in SIP signaling.  So there
      is a need to describe the valid ways in which these two forms of
      signaling interact.  That is covered in Section 5.

3.3.1.  Two CLUE-capable endpoints

   This is the case where two CLUE-capable endpoints are willing to set
   up a CLUE telepresence session.  In the following, a possible
   approach addressing the problem is illustrated.

   First, endpoint EP1 sends to endpoint EP2 a SIP INVITE including in
   the SDP body the basilar audio and video capabilities ("BASIC SDP")
   and the information needed for opening a control channel to be used
   for CLUE protocol messages exchange, according to what is envisioned
   in the COMEDIA approach ("COMEDIA") for DTLS/SCTP channel
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp].

   After the successful SIP O/A phase, EP1 and EP2 are able to exchange
   audio and video streams ("BASIC AUDIO AND VIDEO").  [RP: Is this
   channel needed at this point of the call flow?]  [RP: which streams
   are sent on this channel in this moment?]

   Moreover, another effect of the above successful SIP O/A phase, is
   the opening of the control channel.  After the setup phase, the
   channel is established and CLUE protocol messages can flow above it.

   CLUE protocol messages have not been formally defined yet.  However,
   up to now there is a common agreement on their names and their main
   purposes, that should be following.

   CLUE protocol ADVERTISEMENT messages are used to better describe the
   media provider's available streams in order to make the media
   consumer able to reproduce them in a more realistic fashion, as it is
   the main purpose of a telepresence session.  These messages are
   needed since it is not possible in an agile fashion to describe
   spatial information and several further metadata about media captures
   via SDP.

   In this document it is assumed that ADVERTISEMENT messages contain

   the full description of the sender's telepresence room in terms of
   available media capture and encoding capabilities.  [RP: open issue -
   the mapping between what is described in the advertisement messages
   and media streams exchanged in the eventual basic SDP session already
   established]

   CLUE protocol CONFIGURE messages are used to let the media consumer
   indicate to the media provider which are the available streams it is
   interested in, so that the media provider can send to the media
   consumer what it desires.

   In the following, it is considered one of the possible call flow that
   can lead to the desired session configuration.

   EP1 sends the ADVERTISEMENT message to EP2 (ADVERTISEMENT 1), which
   replies with a CONFIGURE message (CONFIGURE 1).  After receiving the
   CONFIGURE message, EP1 assumes the CLUE offer/answer negotiation it
   started is completed.  EP1 then can issue a REINVITE to EP2 with an
   SDP body updated accordingly to the CLUE messages exchange.

   Similarly, EP2 sends its ADVERTISEMENT to EP1 (ADVERTISEMENT 2),
   which replies with a CONFIGURE (CONFIGURE 2).

   EP1 re-negotiates the media involved in the existent session via a
   SIP REINVITE message to EP2.  The SDP body within the REINVITE
   message reflects the negotiation carried on by the CLUE message
   exchange.  In the case represented in figure, EP2 builds the 200 OK
   response also according to the second CLUE O/A negotiation.

3.3.2.  A case with a non-CLUE-capable endpoint

   In this example, one of the two involved endpoint (EP2) is not CLUE-
   capable, i.e., it is not able to use the CLUE protocol.

   body the basilar audio and video capabilities ("BASIC SDP") and the
   information needed for opening a control channel to be used for CLUE
   protocol messages exchange, as envisioned by the COMEDIA approach
   ("COMEDIA") for DTLS/SCTP channel [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp].

   Since EP2 is not CLUE-capable, it answers with a 200 OK in which
   basic audio and video capabilities are accepted while the opening of
   the CLUE channel is rejected.

   From such a response, EP1 understands the peer is not CLUE-capable.
   In this example, EP1 re-negotiates the session according to a pre-
   determined bulk of media streams to be sent to non-CLUE-capable
   endpoints.

3.4.  Message Transport

   CLUE messages are transported over CLUE channels.  In a two-party
   CLUE session, a CLUE channel connects the two endpoints.  In a CLUE
   conference, each endpoint has a CLUE channel connecting it to an MCU.
   (In conferences with cascaded mixers [RFC4353], two MCUs will be
   connected by a CLUE channel.)

   The transport mechanism used for CLUE messages is DTLS/SCTP as
   specified in [I-D.tuexen-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps] and
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp].  A CLUE channel consists of one SCTP
   stream in each direction over a DTLS/SCTP session.  The mechanism for
   establishing the DTLS/SCTP session is described in Section 4.

3.5.  Message Framing

   Message framing is provided by the SCTP transport protocol.  Each
   CLUE message is carried in one SCTP message.

3.6.  other


4.  CLUE use of SDP O/A

   The CLUE channel is usually offered in the first SIP O/A exchange
   between two parties in an intended CLUE session.  The offer of the
   CLUE channel is the indicator that this SIP session is proposing to
   establish a CLUE session.

   (However it is also acceptable to start with a non-CLUE SIP session
   and upgrade it to a CLUE session later.)

   The mechanism for negotiating a DTLS/SCTP connection is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp].  We need to specify how to select the

   specific pair of SCTP streams that comprise the CLUE channel.

   Any specific usage/conventions required for coordination of SDP
   offers and answers with the CLUE messages should also be described
   here.

   (We have a draft [I-D.even-clue-sdp-clue-relation] that can
   contribute to this.)


5.  Coordination of CLUE protocol and SDP O/A

   This should include state machines and/or call flows.  These will
   illustrate, and then provide normative rules for valid sequences of
   messages of both types.  For instance this needs to show when SDP
   offers and answers must occur relative to an ADVERTISEMENT or
   CONFIGURE message that requires SDP changes.

   [THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS DOCUMENT!]


6.  CLUE requirements on SDP O/A

   Any SDP extensions required by CLUE should be specified here.  Then
   we will need to take action within MMUSIC to make those happen.  This
   section should be empty and removed before this document becomes an
   RFC.


7.  SIP Signaling

   (Placeholder) This may be unremarkable.  If so we can drop it.


8.  Interoperation with Legacy SIP Devices

   This may just describe how the degenerate form of the general
   mechanisms work for legacy devices.  Or it may describe special case
   handling that we mandate as part of CLUE.  Or it may just discuss
   non-normative things for implementors should consider.


9.  CLUE over RTCWEB

   We may want to rule this out of scope for now.  But we should be
   thinking about this.

10.  Open Issues

   Here are issues pertinent to signaling that need resolution.
   Resolution will probably result in changes somewhere in this
   document, but may also impact other documents.

   o  While the preference is to multiplex multiple capture encodings
      over a single RTP session, this will not always be desirable or
      possible.  The factors that prevent multiplexing may come from
      either the provider or the consumer.  So the extent of
      multiplexing must be negotiated.  The decision about how to
      multiplex affects the number and grouping of m-lines in the SDP.
      The endpoint of a CLUE session that sends an offer needs to know
      the mapping of capture encodings to m-lines for both sides.

      AFAIK this issue hasn't yet been considered at all.
