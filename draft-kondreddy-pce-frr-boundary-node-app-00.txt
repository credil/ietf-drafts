Abstract

   Path computation element (PCE) can be used to compute a label
   switched path that spans across multiple domains.  This document
   explain the mechanism of Fast Re-Route (FRR) where a point of local
   repair (PLR) needs to find the appropriate merge point (MP) to do
   bypass path computation using PCE.  In case of boundary node
   protection when PCE confidentiality (path key) is enabled, new
   mechanisms are suggested in this document.

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] can be used to perform
   complex path computation in large single domain, multi-domain and
   multi-layered networks.  The PCE can also be used to compute a
   variety of restoration and protection paths and services.

   As stated in [RFC4090], there are two independent methods (one-to-one
   backup and facility backup) of doing fast reroute (FRR).  PCE can be
   used to compute backup path for both the methods.  Cooperating PCEs
   may be used to compute inter-domain backup path.

   In case of one to one backup method, the destination MUST be the
   tail-end of the protected LSP.  Whereas for facility backup,
   destination MUST be the address of the merge point (MP) from the
   corresponding point of local repair (PLR).  The problem of finding
   the MP using the interface addresses or node-ids present in Record
   Route Object (RRO) of protected path can be easily solved in the case
   of a single Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area because the PLR has
   the complete Traffic Engineering Database (TED).  Thus, the PLR can
   unambiguously determine -

   o  Is a backup tunnel intersecting a protected TE LSP on a downstream
      node exists?

   o  The MP address regardless of RRO IPv4 or IPv6 sub-objects
      (interface address or LSR ID).

   It is complex for a PLR to find the MP in case of boundary node
   protection for computing a bypass path because the PLR doesn't have
   the full TED visibility.  When confidentiality (via path key)
   [RFC5520] is enabled, finding MP is very complex.

   This document describes the mechanism to find MP and to setup bypass
   tunnel to protect a boundary node.

3.  Methods to find MP and calculate the optimal backup path

   The Merge Point (MP) address is required at the PLR in order to
   select a bypass tunnel intersecting a protected Traffic Engineering
   Label Switched Path (TE LSP) on a downstream LSR.

   Some implementations may choose to pre-configure a bypass tunnel on
   PLR with destination address as MP.  MP's Domain to be traversed by
   bypass path can be administratively configured or learned via some
   other means (ex Hierarchical PCE (HPCE) [PCE-HIERARCHY-FWK]).  Path
   Computation Client (PCC) on PLR can request its local PCE to compute
   bypass path from PLR to MP, excluding links and node between PLR and
   MP.  At PLR once primary tunnel is up, a pre-configured bypass tunnel
   is bound to the primary tunnel, note that multiple bypass tunnel can
   also exist.

   Most implementations may choose to create a bypass tunnel on PLR
   after primary tunnel is signaled with Record Route Object (RRO) being
   present in primary path's Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Path
   Reserve message.  MP address has to be determined (described below)
   to create a bypass tunnel.  PCC on PLR can request its local PCE to
   compute bypass path from PLR to MP, excluding links and node between
   PLR and MP.

   the failure of link [R2->R3] and node [R3].  R2 is PLR and R4 is MP
   in this case.  Since, both PLR and MP belong to the same area.  The
   problem of finding the MP using the interface addresses or node-ids
   can be easily solved.  Thus, the PLR can unambiguously determine
   whether a backup tunnel intersecting a protected TE LSP on a
   downstream node exists and can also find the MP address regardless of
   RRO IPv4 or IPv6 sub-objects (interface address or LSR ID).

   TED on PLR will have the information of both R2 and R4, which can be
   used to find MP's TE router IP address and compute optimal backup
   path from R2 to R4, excluding link [R2->R3] and node [R3].

   Thus, RSVP-TE can signal bypass tunnel along the computed path.

   In Figure 2, cooperating PCE(s) (PCE-1 and PCE-2) have computed the

   link [R2->R3] and node [R3].  R2 is PLR and R4 is MP.  Both PLR and
   MP are in different area.  TED on PLR doesn't have the information of
   R4.

   The problem of finding the MP address in a network with inter-domain
   TE LSP is solved by inserting a node-id sub-object [RFC4561] in the
   RRO object carried in the RSVP Path Reserve message.  PLR can find

   out the MP from the RRO it has received in Path Reserve message from
   its downstream LSR.

   But the computation of optimal backup path from R2 to R4, excluding
   link [R2->R3] and node [R3] is not possible with running of
   Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm locally at R2.  PCE
   can be used to compute backup path in this case.  R2 acting as PCC on
   PLR can request PCE-1 to compute bypass path from PLR(R2) to MP(R4),
   excluding link [R2->R3] and node [R3].  PCE MAY use inter-domain path
   computation mechanism (like HPCE ([PCE-HIERARCHY-FWK]) etc) when the
   domain information of MP is unknown at PLR.  Further, RSVP-TE can
   signal bypass tunnel along the computed path.

   In Figure 3, Links [R2->R3] and [R2->R6] are inter-AS links.  IGP
   extensions ([RFC5316] and [RFC5392]) describe the flooding of
   inter-AS TE information for inter-AS path computation.  Cooperating
   PCE(s) (PCE-1 and PCE-2) have computed the primary LSP Path
   [R1->R2->R3->R4->R5] and provided to R1 (PCC).

   R2 is PLR and R4 is MP.  Both PLR and MP are in different AS.  TED on
   PLR doesn't have the information of R4.

   The address of MP can be found using node-id sub-object [RFC4561] in
   the RRO object carried in the RSVP Path Reserve message.  And
   Cooperating PCEs could be used to compute the inter-AS bypass path.
   Thus ASBR boundary node protection is similar to ABR protection.

3.2.3.  Boundary node protection with Path-Key Confidentiality

   [RFC5520] defines a mechanism to hide the contents of a segment of a
   path, called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS).  The CPS may be
   replaced by a path-key that can be conveyed in the PCE Communication
   Protocol (PCEP) and signaled within in a Resource Reservation
   Protocol TE (RSVP-TE) explicit route object.

   [RFC5553] states that, when the signaling message crosses a domain
   boundary, the path segment that needs to be hidden (that is, a CPS)
   MAY be replaced in the RRO with a PKS.  Note that RRO in Path Reserve
   message carries the same PKS as originally signaled in the ERO of the
   Path message.

            Figure 4: Node Protection for R3 (ABR) and Path-Key

   In Figure 4, when path-key is enabled, cooperating PCE(s) (PCE-1 and
   PCE-2) have computed the primary LSP Path [R1->R2->R3->PKS->R9] and
   provided to R1 (PCC).  Note that there isn't a way to identify the MP
   when path-key is enabled i.e. using node-id subobject will not work.

3.2.3.1.1.  Option 1: New MP Subobject

   In Figure 4, on receiving ERO at R3 with PKS, it SHOULD request the
   PCE identified by PCE-ID in path key subobject to expand the path
   segment and on receiving RRO it should replace the CPS with the same
   PKS and append its own RRO subobjects.  The boundary node can also
   append the identity of the MP.

   Note that the RRO in Path Reserve Messages can be carried as it is as
   ERO in Path Message.  So if we use the same node-id object as
   described in [RFC4561] along with PKS it will lead to a looping issue

   as explained below -

   In Figure 4, at R1 the RRO received will be [R1->R2->R3->R4->PKS->R9]
   with R4 as the node-id subobject added by R3. if this path is
   signaled using the ERO, after expansion of PKS at node R3, will lead
   to presence of R4 twice leading to loop.  Note that the issue exists
   irrespective of the ordering of PKS and Node-id subobject.

   Hence there is a need for a new sub-object to identify the MP incase
   of path-key.  This sub-object should be added by the boundary node
   (R3) during the RRO Path key processing.  The PLR can use the MP sub-
   object to identify the MP.  To avoid the looping issue, the immediate
   upstream LSR (usually PLR) should remove this sub-object from the RRO
   at the time of RRO processing.

   [RFC3209] defines the IPv4 and IPv6 RRO subobjects.

   In this document, we define the following new flag:

   MP-id: 0x40 (TBA)

   When set, this indicates that the address specified in the RRO's IPv4
   or IPv6 sub-object is a MP-id address, which refers to the "Router
   Address" of the MP as defined in [RFC3630], or "Traffic Engineering
   Router ID" as defined in [RFC5305].

   An IPv4 or IPv6 RRO sub-object with the MP-id flag set is also called
   a MP-id sub-object.  The problem of finding an MP address when
   pathkey is enabled in a network with inter-domain TE LSP is solved by
   inserting a MP-id sub-object (an RRO "IPv4" and "IPv6" sub-object
   with the 0x40 flag (TBA) set) in the RRO object carried in the RSVP
   Path Reserve message.

3.2.3.1.2.  Option 2: PCE Path-key Handling

   In Figure 4, when path-key is enabled, PCE-2 will replace the segment
   [R3->R4->R5->R9] with [R3->PKS->R9].  To enable FRR protection with
   path-key, following change should be done -

   o  Scope of confidential path segment is relaxed to immediate
      downstream node i.e.  [R3->R4->PKS->R9] note that R3->R4 MAYBE the
      address of the interface instead of LSR-ID.

   o  Pathkey expansion during signaling would be done at the immediate
      downstream node of the boundary node.  Note that this node must
      have PCC functionality.

   o  This facilitates the insertion of node-id sub-object [RFC4561] in
      the RRO object from immediate next downstream node of BN in the
      RSVP Path Reserve message and aids the PLR in previous domain to
      determine MP

   In Figure 4, during RSVP signaling, on receiving ERO at R4 with PKS,
   it SHOULD request the PCE identified by PCE-ID in path key subobject
   to expand the path segment and on receiving RRO it should replace the
   CPS with the same PKS and append its RRO subobjects including Node-id
   subobject.

   On successful signaling of primary tunnel, R2 has to build a bypass
   tunnel that protects against the failure of link [R2->R3] and node
   [R3].  Note that by above mechanism PLR (R2) knows the identity of MP
   (R4) via the RRO Node-id subobject.

   Also consider the case of R4 node protection within a single IGP
   area.  R3 is PLR and R5 should become MP.

                     Figure 5: Node Protection for R4

   In Figure 5, RRO received in RSVP Path Reserve message at R3 contains
   [R3->R4->PKS->R9].  Since there is no node-id sub-object in RRO
   beyond R4, R3 may not be able to find R5 as MP without expansion of
   PKS.  R3 SHOULD request the PCE identified by PCE-ID in PKS to expand
   the path segment.  Note that, the PCE should retain the pathkey for
   some time as multiple expansion requests will be issued.  R3 can now
   find the identity of MP (R5).

   The address of MP can be found using the same mechanism as explained
   above.  Thus ASBR boundary node protection is similar to ABR
   protection.

5.  Security Considerations

   PCE(s) when computes the inter-domain path will generate PKS relaxing
   the path from BN to next immediate downstream router.  (Refer
   Section 3.2.3.1.2) This relaxation is required to find MP in case of
   BN node protection.  This may be an added security risk.  Note that
   the facility backup method requires that a PLR and its selected MP
   trust RSVP messages received from each other.

   Further analysis must be done.

6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
