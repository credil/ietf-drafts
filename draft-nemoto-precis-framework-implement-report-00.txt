Internet-Draft   precis framework implementation report        July 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document is a report of implementation experience to evaluate
   whether precis framework [I-D.ietf-precis-framework] for SASLprepbis
   [I-D.melnikov-precis-saslprepbis] can implement and findings from
   this experience.

   Some implementations of IDNA2008 [RFC5890][RFC5891][RFC5892]
   [RFC5893][RFC5894] are expected to be modified to fit precis
   framework.  The experience was to examine whether a implementation
   based on IDNA2008 has useful processes and needs modifications for
   precis framework.

   In this document, two implementations based on precis framework are
   described.  The one is to evaluate the feasibility of implementation
   for precis framework.  This implementation is modified an
   implementation of IDNA2008 to provide useful features such as
   normalization and mapping for precis framework and SASLprepbis.  The
   other is empirically to calculate precis' derived property value and
   to generate idnabis-tables.xml alike table based on precis framework
   by using Unicode properties files.

   These implementations are experimental for limited to SASLprepbis and
   not generic.

2.  Experience

2.1.  Purposes

   Purposes of the implementations are following;

   o  To evaluate whether precis framework can implement.

   o  To examine whether implementations based on IDNA2008 has useful
      features and needs modifications for precis framework
      implementations.

   o  To evaluate whether generated table's derived property value by
      this implementation is the same as precis framework's one.

2.2.  Implementations

   In this document, two implementations based on precis framework are
   described.  These implementations follow implementations of IDNA2008
   [I-D.nemoto-idna2008-implementation-report].

   The one is modified implementation of IDNA2008 for precis framework.
   The base implementation provides APIs for handling internationalized
   domain names.  This implementation is for providing mapping
   SASLprepbis defined and strings validity check.  The implementation
   is to evaluate whether SASLprepbis as one of precis framework's
   property can be implemented and to find out whether implementations
   based on IDNA2008 has useful features and needs modifications for
   precis framework implementations.

   The implementation can import tables of certain version of Unicode
   properties and corresponding derived property value table for precis
   framework which is the same format as idnabis-tables.xml for
   codepoint validation.

   The other is empirically to calculate precis' derived property value
   and to generate idnabis-tables.xml alike table based on precis
   framework by using Unicode properties files.

3.  Findings

   Findings from implementation experience are following.

   o  SASLprepbis as one of precis framework's property can implement.

   o  Useful processes of IDNA2008 implementation for precis framework
      are following.

      *  Some mapping features
         Ex.  Casefolding, nfc, width

      *  Strings validity checking processes
         Ex.  For derived property value (As necessary, the file
         describing derived property value table for precis should be
         generated.)
         Ex.  For string length is non-zero

   o  Modifications to IDNA2008 implementation for precis framework are
      following.

      *  Mappings depend on each protocols defined mapping table.
         Ex.  Special mapping (Map to SPACE, Map to Nothing)

      *  Checking whether strings are precis NAME CLASS or FREE CLASS
         processes

   o  In IDNA2008, handling order is NFC and then strings validity
      checking.  But, in SASLprepbis handling order is precis strings
      validity checking and then NFC.  This different handling order may
      be one of problems at modifications to IDNA2008 implementation for
      SASLprepbis.  We evaluated their order of handling and found
      different results from each handling orders.
      I.e.  In Hangul, some characters' derived property value is
      DISALLOWED before NFC, but after NFC the value is PVALID.
      Before NFC: HANGUL JAMO (1100+1161) = DISALLOWED
      After NFC: HANGUL SYLLABLE (AC00) = PVALID
      If these different results are not critical, it may be better for
      developers that SASLprepbis' handling order imitates IDNA2008's
      one as NFC and then strings validity checking.

   o  Generated table's derived property value by this implementation
      isn't the same as precis framework's one.
      Ex. "00BA" is FREE_PVAL in precis framework's table but PVALID in
      the generated one.
      Ex. "074B" is PVALID in precis framework's table but UNASSIGNED in
      the generated one.
      In these case, according to on Unicode properties files values,

      the generated table's values are correct.  Precis framework's
      table may need to review.
