     1. Introduction 

        The EMAN standards provide a specification for Energy 
        Management. This document defines a subset of a Management 
        Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols 
        for Energy monitoring of network devices and devices attached to 
        the network and possibly extending to devices in the industrial 
        automation setting with a network interface.  
         
        The focus of the MIB module specified in this document is on the 
        identification of Energy Objects and reporting the context and 
        relationships of Energy Objects as defined in [EMAN-FMWK]. The 
        module addresses Energy Object Identification, Energy Object 
        Context, and Energy Object Relationships. 
      
         
     1.1. Energy Management Document Overview 

        This document specifies the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB module. 
        This document is based on the Energy Management Framework [EMAN-
        FMWK] and meets the requirements on identification of Energy 
        Objects and their context and relationships as specified in the 
        Energy Management requirements [EMAN-REQ]. 
                           
        A second MIB module required by the [EMAN-FMWK], the Power and 
        Energy Monitoring MIB [EMAN-MON-MIB], monitors the Energy 
        Objects for Power States, for the Power and Energy consumption. 
        Power State monitoring includes: retrieving Power States, Power 
        State properties, current Power State, Power State transitions, 
        and Power State statistics. In addition, this MIB module 
        provides the Power Characteristics properties of the Power 
        and Energy, along with optional characteristics. 
         
        The applicability statement document [EMAN-AS] provides the list 
        of use cases, and describes the common aspects of between 
        existing Energy standards and the EMAN standard, and shows how 
        the EMAN framework relates to other frameworks.

     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
        current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
        section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI). This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant with 
        SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, 
        RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
         
         
     3. Requirements and Use Cases 

         
        Firstly, to illustrate the importance of energy monitoring in 
        networks and secondly to list some of the important areas to be 
        addressed by the energy management Framework, several use cases 
        and network scenarios are presented in the EMAN applicability 
        statement document [EMAN-AS]. In addition, for each scenario, 
        the target devices for energy management, and how those devices 
        powered and metered are also presented. To address the network 
        scenarios, requirements for power and energy monitoring for 
        networking devices are specified in [EMAN-REQ]. Based on the 
        requirements [EMAN-REQ], the [EMAN-FMWK] presents an solution 
        approach.  
         
        Accordingly, the scope of the MIB module in this document is in 
        accordance to the requirements specified in [EMAN-REQ] and 
        [EMAN-FMWK].  
      
         
     4. Terminology 

      
       EDITOR'S NOTE:  
        
       The individual draft submission [EMAN-TERMINOLOGY] contains the 
       terminology used in this draft. Please refer to WG draft [EMAN-
       FMWK] for the definitions of the terminology used in this draft.

     5. Architecture Concepts Applied to the MIB Module 

        This section describes the basic concepts specified in the 
        Energy Management Architecture [EMAN-FMWK], with specific 
        information related to the MIB module specified in this 
        document. 
         
        The Energy Object Context MIB module defined in this document 
        defines MIB objects for identification of Energy Objects, and 
        reporting context and relationship of an Energy Object. The 
        managed objects are contained in two tables eoTable and 
        eoProxyTable.  
         
        The first table eoTable focuses on the link to the other MIB 
        modules, context of the Energy Object. The second table 
        eoRelationTable specifies the relationships between Energy 
        Objects. This is a simplified representation of relationship 
        between Energy Objects. The third table eoProxyTable describes 
        the proxy capabilities of a Energy Object Parent for a specific 
        local Energy Object Child.

          "Energy Object Identity Persistence" 
         
         
     5.1 Energy Object Identification    

        Refer to the "Energy Object Information" section in [EMAN-FMWK] 
        for background information about Energy Objects.   
         
        Every Energy Object MUST implement the unique index, 
        entPhysicalIndex, from the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133], which is used 
        as index for the primary Energy Object information in the 
        ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB module. 
          
        Every Energy Object MUST have a printable name assigned to it. 
        Energy Objects MUST implement the entPhysicalName object 
        specified in the ENTITY-MIB, which must contain the Energy 
        Object name.  

        By the [RFC4133] definition, the entPhysicalUris contains a 
        white space separated list of Uniform Resource Identifier 
        (s)(URIs). For the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB compliance, every 
        Energy Object instance MUST implement the entPhysicalUris from 
        the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133]. The entPhysicalUris MUST contain the 
        Energy Object UUID, in a form consistent with [RFC4122]. Note 
        that the entPhysicalUris, from the ENTITY-MIB, is a read-write 
        managed object, and that, as a consequence the UUID could be set 
        by a management system.   

        As displayed in [RFC4122], the following is an example of the 
        string representation of a UUID as a URN: urn:uuid:f81d4fae-
        7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6.  

         
        Other ENTITY MIB related managed objects, in addition to 
        entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalName, and entPhysicalUris [RFC4133] 
        MAY be implemented. For example, to understand the relationship 
        between Energy Object Components and Energy Objects, the ENTITY-
        MIB physical containment tree [RFC4133] MUST be implemented.

     Internet-Draft   < Energy Object Context MIB >      July  2012 
      
        A second example deals with one of the ENTITY-MIB extensions: if 
        the Energy Object temperature is required, the managed objects 
        from the ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB [RFC3433] should be supported. 
         
        When an Energy Object Parent acts as a Power Aggregator or a 
        Power Proxy, the Energy Object Parent and its Energy Object 
        Child/Children MUST be members of the same Energy Management 
        Domain, specified by the eoDomainName MIB Object.  
         
        Each Energy Object MUST belong to a single Energy Management 
        Domain or in other words, an Energy Object cannot belong to more 
        than one Energy Management Domain. Refer to the "Energy 
        Management Domain" section in [EMAN-FMWK] for background 
        information. The eoDomainName, which is an element of the 
        eoTable, is a read-write MIB object. The Energy Management 
        Domain should map 1-1 with a metered or sub-metered portion of 
        the network. The Energy Management Domain MUST be configured on 
        the Energy Object Parent. The Energy Object Children MAY inherit 
        the some of the domain parameters (possibly domain name, some of 
        the context information such as role or keywords, importance) 
        from the Energy Object Parent or the Energy Management Domain 
        MAY be configured directly in an Energy Object Child.  
         

     5.2 Energy Object Context 

        Refer to the "Energy Object Context" section in [EMAN-FMWK] for 
        background information. 
         
        An Energy Object must provide a value for eoImportance in the 
        range of 1..100 to help differentiate the use or relative value 
        of the device. The importance range is from 1 (least important) 
        to 100 (most important). The default importance value is 1.   
      
        An Energy Object can provide a set of eoKeywords. These keywords 
        are a list of tags that can be used for grouping and summary 
        reporting within or between Energy Management Domains. 
         
      
        An Energy Object can be classified based on the physical 
        properties of the Energy Object. That Energy Object can be 
        classified as consuming power or supplying power to other 
        devices or that Energy Object can perform both of those 
        functions and finally, an Energy Object can be a passive meter.   
         
      


      
      
     <Parello, Claise>      Expires January 11, 2013           [Page 9] 
         
     Internet-Draft   < Energy Object Context MIB >      July  2012 
      
        Additionally, an Energy Object can provide an eoRoleDescription 
        string that indicates the purpose the Energy Object serves in 
        the network. 
      

         
     5.3 Links to Other Identifiers    

        While the entPhysicalIndex is the primary index for all MIB 
        objects in the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB module, the Energy 
        Management Systems (EnMS) must be able to make the link with the 
        identifier(s) in other supported MIB modules. 
      
        If the Energy Object is a PoE port, and if the Power over  
        Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported by the Energy Object SNMP 
        agent, then the Energy Object eoethPortIndex and 
        eoethPortGrpIndex MUST contain the values of pethPsePortIndex 
        and pethPsePortGroupIndex [RFC3621].  
         
        The Energy Object eoLldpPortNumber MUST contain the 
        lldpLocPortNum from the LLDP MIB [LLDP-MIB], if the LLDP-MED  
        MIB is supported on the Energy Object SNMP agent. 
         
        The intent behind the links to the other MIB module 
        identifier(s) is to correlate the instances in the different MIB 
        modules. This will allow the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB MIB 
        module to reference other MIB modules in cases where the Power 
        over Ethernet and the LLDP MIB modules are supported by the SNMP 
        agent. Some use cases may not implement any of these two MIB 
        modules for the Energy Objects. However, in situation where any 
        of these two MIB modules are implemented, the EnMS must be able 
        to correlate the instances in the different MIB modules. 
         
        The eoAlternateKey alternate key object specifies a manufacturer 
        defined string that can be used to identify the Energy Object.  
        Since EnMS may need to correlate objects across management 
        systems, this alternate key is provided to facilitate such a 
        link.  This optional value is intended as a foreign key or 
        alternate identifier for a manufacturer or EnMS to use to 
        correlate the unique Energy Object Id in other systems or 
        namespaces. If an alternate key is not available or is not 
        applicable then the value is the zero-length string. 
                        
         
     5.4 Child: Energy Object Relationships 

        Refer to the "Energy Object Parent and Child" section in [EMAN-
        FMWK] for the definition and background information.

     Internet-Draft   < Energy Object Context MIB >      July  2012 
      
        In order to link the Energy Object Child and the Energy Object  
        Parent, a separate table (eoRelationTable) has been introduced  
        in this MIB module. The following relationships between Energy 
        objects have been considered in the eoRelationTable.   
      
          
          Metering Relationship   ->  meteredby , metering 
              
          Power Source Relationship ->  poweredby , powering 
      
          Aggregation Relationship ->   aggregatedby , aggregating  
          
          Proxy Relationship       ->   proxyby , proxying  
          
                                        
        Each Energy object can have one or more Energy Object 
        relationships with other Energy Objects. Depending on the  
        direction of the relationship, an Energy Object can be 
        considered as an Energy Object Parent or an Energy Object Child.  
        The relationship between the Energy Objects is specified with an 
        arbitrary index and the UUID of the remote Energy Object. The 
        UUID MUST comply to the RFC 4122 specifications.  It is 
        important to note that it is possible that an Energy Object may 
        not have an Energy Object relationship with other Energy 
        Objects. 
      
        Proxy is a special relationship, and the Energy Object can 
        designate another Energy Object that can have the proxy 
        capabilities such as energy reporting, power state 
        configurations, non physical wake capabilities (such as Wake-on-
        LAN)), or any combination of capabilities.   
      
        The eoProxyAbilities object is specific to the Proxy 
        Relationship.  This object describes the capabilities of the 
        Energy Object Parent for the Energy Object Child represented by 
        the entPhysicalIndex. The possible capabilities are: report, 
        configuration, and/or wakeonlan.  This object only applies to an 
        Energy Object Child.  
      
        Since the communication between the Energy Object Parent and 
        Energy Object Child may not be via SNMP (as defined in EMAN-
        FMWK), an Energy Object Child can have additional MIB objects 
        that can be used for easier identification by the EnMS. The 
        optional objects eoMgmtMacAddress, eoMgmtAddressType 
        eoMgmtDNSName can be used to help identify the relationship 
        between the child and other NMS objects.  These objects can be

     Internet-Draft   < Energy Object Context MIB >      July  2012 
      
        used as an alternate key to help link the Energy Object with 
        other keyed information that may be stored within the EnMS(s). 
      

     5.5 Parent: Energy Object Relationships 

       When the Energy Object is an Energy Object Parent, the 
       relationship table specifies the relationships to every Energy 
       Object children. The explicit relationship between the Energy 
       Object parent and each Energy Object child can be powering, 
       metering, proxying and aggregating.  
      
         
     5.6 Energy Object Identity Persistence 

        In some situations, the Energy Object identity information 
        should be persistent even after a device reload.  For example, 
        in a static setup where a switch monitors a series of connected 
        PoE phones, there is a clear benefit for the EnMS if the Energy 
        Object Identification and all associated information persist, as 
        it saves a network discovery.  However, in other situations, 
        such as a wireless access point monitoring the mobile user PCs, 
        there is not much advantage to persist the Energy Object 
        Information.   The identity information of an Energy Object 
        should be persisted and there is value in the writable MIB 
        objects persisted.

     7. Security Considerations  

        Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
        thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these 
        objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects 
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.   
         
        There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB 
        modules with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
        create.  Such objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable 
        in some network environments.  The support for SET operations in 
        a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
        negative effect on network operations.  The following are the 
        tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         
          . Unauthorized changes to the eoDomainName, entPhysicalName, 
             eoRoleDescription, eoKeywords, and/or eoImportance MAY 
             disrupt power and energy collection, and therefore any 
             predefined policies defined in the network. 
         
      
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using 
        IPsec), there is still no secure control over who on the secure 
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB modules. 
         
      
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).

     Internet-Draft   < Energy Object Context MIB >      July  2012 
      
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 
         
         
     8. IANA Considerations 

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
         
          Descriptor                         OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
          ----------                         ----------------------- 
          energyAwareMIB                     { mib-2 xxx } 
                     
        Additions to this MIB module are subject to Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested MIB objects for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description.  Requests for MIB objects that duplicate the 
        functionality of existing objects SHOULD be declined.  The 
        smallest available OID SHOULD be assigned to a new MIB objects.  
        The specification of new MIB objects SHOULD follow the structure 
        specified in Section 6 and MUST be published using a well-
        established and persistent publication medium.   
         
      
     9. Acknowledgement  

        We would like to thank Juergen Quittek and Juergen Schoenwalder 
        for their suggestions on the new design of EnergyRelationsTable 
        which was a proposed solution for the open issue on the 
        representation of Energy Object children as a UUIDlist.  

        Many thanks to Juergen Quittek for many comments on the wording, 
        text and design of the MIB thus resulting in an improved draft.  

        In addition the authors thank Bill Mielke for his multiple 
        reviews, Brad Schoening and Juergen Schoenwaelder for their 
        suggestions and Michael Brown for dramatically improving this 
        draft.

     10. Open Issues 

      
        OPEN ISSUE 1: Do we need global persistence with the object  
        eoTablePersistence; some objects in the eoTable are read-only 
        objects.    
         
        OPEN ISSUE 2: Can we have persistence of entPhysicalIndex or 
        entPhysicalUris. That implies persistence of Entity MIB objects. 
        How about persistence of PoE MIB objects ?
