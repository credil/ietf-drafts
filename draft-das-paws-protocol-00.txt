2.  Terminology and abbreviations used in this document 
   								
Following definitions are copied from [[I-D.ietf-paws-problem-stmt-usecases-rqmts]

TV White Space
 TV white space refers specifically to radio spectrum which has been
 allocated for TV broadcast, but is not occupied by a TV broadcast, or
 other licensed user (such as a wireless microphone), at a specific 
 location and time.

White Space 
 Radio spectrum which has been allocated for some primary use, but is not
 fully occupied by that primary use at a specific location and time.

White Space Device
  A device which is a secondary user of some part of white space 
  spectrum. A white space device can be an access point, base station, 
  a portable device or similar.  In this context, a white space device is 
  required to query a database with its location to obtain information
  about available spectrum

Database
 In the context of white space and cognitive radio technologies, the
 database is an entity which contains current information about available
 spectrum at any given location and other types of information.

Master Device 
 A device which queries the WS Database to find out the available 
 operating channels.

Following definitions are copied from [FCC].

TV Bands Database (TVBD) 
 A database system that maintains records of all authorized services in
 the TV frequency bands, is capable of determining the available channels
 as a specific geographic location.

Fixed Device 
 A TVBD that transmits and/or receives radio communication signals at a 
 specified fixed location. 
	

Mode I personal/portable device
 A personal/portable TVBD that does not use an internal geolocation 
 capability and access to a TV bands database to obtain a list of 
 available channels.

Mode II personal/portable device
 A personal/portable TVBD that uses an internal geo-location capability 
 and access to a TV bands database, either through a direct connection to 
 the Internet or through an indirect connection to the Internet by way of
 fixed TVBD or another Mode II TVBD, to obtain a list of available 
 channels.

3.  Introduction 

 Services offered via the TV Whitespaces initiative will require a 
 variety of devices and services each acting in accord with rules 
 provided by the regulatory bodies and industries. In this document, we
 focus on one aspect of that overall system: the interface between a 
 `Device` and `WS Database`. The `Device` type definition may differ from
 one regulatory authority to another. For example, by United States (US)
 FCC rules, `Device` is referred to a `Fixed` and `Personal/Portable 
 device` (e.g. `Mode II personal/portable device` [FCC]). 

 The Fixed and personal/portable TVWS devices may additionally support 
 other Whitespace devices (e.g. Mode I personal/portable device per US
 FCC rules [FCC]) to establish wireless broadband services. Several use
 cases and requirements for use of White Space spectrum are described in
 draft document [I-D.ietf-paws-problem-stmt-usecases-rqmts].

Das et al.	            Expires May 14, 2012	                 [Page 3]
Internet-Draft	             WS Protocol	             November 2011

 Whitespace protocol must satisfy the requirements that are specified by
 the regulatory authorities. As an example, here we list some US specific
 requirements as specified by Federal Communications Commission [FCC]:

- The TVWS devices are required to periodically access the TV Whitespace
 Database to obtain the list of available TV frequencies (channels) that
 could be utilized at their location. 
- Along with the list of frequencies/channels, the database should also 
 return maximum permissible power levels that could be used by the TVWS
 devices.
-  Fixed and Mode II devices are required to access TVWS database every 
 24 hours to get a list of available TV bands. 
- The Mode II device must additionally do the same upon power-up, and
  whenever they change their position by 50 meters or more. 
- When a Fixed or Mode II device will serve as an access point for Mode I
 devices, the serving Fixed or Mode II must check with the TVWS database
 to ensure that the specified Mode I devices are valid devices at the
 given location. 

 On the other hand, there may be different rules and requirements 
 Specified by other regulatory bodies (e.g., Ofcom) and countries. The
 protocol design should be flexible enough to not only address these
 requirements but also future requirements. 

4.  Protocol Layering  
	
 Figure 1 provides a high level overview of the protocol layers. The
 Whitespace application protocol should use existing Internet protocols
 to provide security and reliable transport.  For example, the protocol
 proposed here could be supported over HTTPS, TCP, and IP.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|   WS Appl. Protocol   |

|         HTTPS         |                     
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| Reliable Transport    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|         IP            |

 The details of adapting the White space application protocol to this or
 other supporting protocol stacks is not addressed at this time.
           
5.  Protocol Features/Functionalities

WS protocol must support several regulatory requirements and include 
features that are essential between the `Device` and the `WS database`.

Das et al.	            Expires May 14, 2012	                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft	             WS Protocol	            November 2011

`Device` refers to an entity that queries the WS Database to find out 
the available operating channels. This is same as `Master Device` as 
defined in [I-D.ietf-paws-problem-stmt-usecases-rqmts]. In this 
document, we list some of the protocol functionalities that we believe 
are required. These features are by no means required to be performed 
in a sequential manner. It is important to note that there may be additional
 features that need to be supported by the interface.

5.1.  Device Bootstrapping  

 Device bootstrapping is the process whereby device establishes an
 Initial connection to the database. For example, each time the device
 powers up or opens up a communication with the database; it requires
 exchanging some messages. These messages for example, will help the 
 device to obtain the security parameters so that the subsequent messages
 can be authenticated and integrity protected. We propose to perform the 
 authentication at the application layer, so as to allow a greater range
 of deployment scenarios. However, one can argue that the device 
 authentication and message integrity can be provided by lower protocol 
 layers. 

 INIT-REQ and INT-RESP are proposed for bootstrapping the device with 
 the database. Figure 2 depicts the message flow and example message
 parameters are then discussed.

5.2.  Device Registration
 
 Device registration is the process of a device establishing certain 
 operational parameters with the database, as required by the spectrum
 management authority.  FCC rules require, for example, that Fixed 
 devices register owner and/or operator contact information.  `Fixed
 Devices` may also register their fixed location and antenna height
 parameters so as to obviate sending that information in other messages
 that would otherwise require them.  Registration thus should not, 
 therefore, be performed upon each power-up; rather, only once upon 
 initial contact with the database, and thereafter, only when its 
 registered parameters change (e.g., a Fixed device is redeployed at a
 new location, or its antenna height is adjusted.) or registration life-
 time expires. It is to be noted that this functionality may be optional
 in certain regulatory domains.

5.3.  Querying the Database 

 In order to obtain the available channel and other associated 
 parameters, the device needs to query the database. In certain 
 regulatory environments, it may be required to be authenticated and
 registered before a device can query the database. In other domains, 
 requirements may be vary. When the `Device` sends a query to the `WS
 Database`, it sends its  location (e.g., Geo-location) along with other
 parameters. `WS Database` returns an array/set of channels within the 
 scope of the request (e.g. VHF/UHF) and regulatory authority where the
 returned elements contain the channel frequency range, availability 
 indicator, operating power, event management (indicator when channel is 
 scheduled is or is not available), and so on. It may also include other
 parameters depending upon the regulatory requirements.

 AVAIL-CHAN-REQ and AVAIL-CHAN-RESP messages are used by devices for
 querying the available channel in a given location.  Figure 4 depicts

5.4.  Device Validation 

 Device validation is the process by which devices can be validated by 
 the database. For example, by US FCC rule, the TVWS fixed or Mode II
 device provides service to a Mode I device only after the Mode I is
 validated by the TVWS database. To facilitate this validation, the WS
 server needs to support `Device Validation` capability. 

 DEV-VALID-REQ and DEV-VALID-RESP messages are used for device 
 Validation with the database. Figure 5 depicts the message flow of the
 Device validation and example message parameters are then discussed:

6.  Encoding Considerations

 The examples above suggest the message structure will have bit-oriented 
 fields, similar to the definition of TCP headers.  However, such should
 be taken as an illustrative example only.  Other encodings (message 
 marshalling techniques) which convey the same semantic information can
 and should be considered.  For example, using XML or JSON to encode the
 same fields discussed above should be an acceptable way forward. This
 may in fact provide development and operational benefits. 

7.  Security Consideration 

Following security requirements should be satisfied:
- Mutual Authentication 
- Message Integrity

Internet-Draft	             WS Protocol	           November 2011


- Confidentiality (optional)
- Replay protection 

Others are TBD. 

 The requirement for the protocol to meet these may be considered in
 conjunction with the underlying services and transports.  For example,
 the above protocol framework provides device authentication, replay-
 protection, and message integrity at the application level. However, 
 the confidentiality is assumed to be provided by the underlying
 transport protocol.
