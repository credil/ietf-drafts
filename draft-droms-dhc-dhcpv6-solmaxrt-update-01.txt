              Modification to Default Value of SOL_MAX_RT
               draft-droms-dhc-dhcpv6-solmaxrt-update-01

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 3315 by redefining the default value for
   SOL_MAX_RT and defining an option through which a DHCPv6 server can
   override the client's default value for SOL_MAX_RT with a new value.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title              December 2011


1.  Introduction

   Section 5.5 of the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315] defines the default
   value of SOL_MAX_RT to be 120 seconds.  In some circumstances, this
   default will lead to an unacceptably high volume of aggregated
   traffic at a DHCPv6 server.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Update to RFC 3315

   This document changes section 5.5 of RFC 3315 [RFC3315] as follows:

   OLD:
      SOL_MAX_RT      120 secs  Max Solicit timeout value

   NEW:
      SOL_MAX_RT     3600 secs  Max Solicit timeout value

   With this change, a DHCPv6 client that does not receive a
   satisfactory response will send Solicit messages with the same
   initial frequency and exponential backoff as specified in section
   17.1.2 of RFC 3315 [RFC3315].  However, the long term behavior of
   these DHCPv6 clients will be to send a Solicit message every 3600
   seconds rather than every 120 seconds, significantly reducing the
   aggregated traffic at the DHCPv6 server.

   The change to SOL_MAX_RT is in response to DHCPv6 message rates
   observed at a DHCPv6 server in a deployment in which many DHCPv6
   clients are sending Solicit messages but the DHCPv6 server has been
   configured not to respond to those Solicit messages.


3.  SOL_MAX_RT option

   A DHCPv6 server sends the SOL_MAX_RT option to a client to override
   the default value of SOL_MAX_RT.  The value of SOL_MAX_RT in the
   option replaces the default value defined in RFC 3315 [RFC3315].  One
   use for the SOL_MAX_RT option is to set a longer value for
   SOL_MAX_RT, which reduces the Solicit traffic from a client that has
   not received a response to its Solicit messages.

   The format of the SOL_MAX_RT option is:

                                 Figure 1

   A DHCPv6 client MUST include the SOL_MAX_RT option code in an Option
   Request option [RFC3315] in any message it sends.

   The DHCPv6 server MAY include the SOL_MAX_RT option in any response
   it sends to a client that has included the SOL_MAX_RT option code in
   an Option Request option.  The SOL_MAX_RT option is sent in the main
   body of the message to client, not as a sub-option in, e.g., an
   IA_NA, IA_TA or IA_PD option.

   If a DHCPv6 client receives an IA_NA or IA_TA option containing a
   SOL_MAX_RT option, the client MUST set its internal SOL_MAX_RT
   parameter to the value contained in the SOL_MAX_RT option.  As a
   result of receiving this option, the DHCPv6 client MUST NOT send any
   Solicit messages more frequently than allowed by the retransmission
   mechanism defined in sections 17.1.2 and 14 of RFC 315 [RFC3315].


4.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces one security considerations beyond those
   described in RFC 3315 [RFC3315].  A malicious DHCPv6 server might
   cause a client to set its SOL_MAX_RT parameter to an arbitrarily high
   value with the SOL_MAX_RT option.  Assuming the client also receives
   a response from a valid DHCPv6 server, the large value for SOL_MAX_RT
   will not have any effect.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code from the "DHCP Option
