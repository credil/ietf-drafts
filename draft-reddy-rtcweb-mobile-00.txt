Internet-Draft          WebRTC in Mobile Networks           January 2013


1.  Introduction

   The use of cellular broadband for accessing the Internet and other
   data services via smartphones, tablets, and notebook/netbook
   computers has increased rapidly as a result of high-speed packet data
   networks such as HSPA, HSPA+, and now Long-Term Evolution (LTE) being
   deployed.  Browsers on these devices are becoming close to their
   desktop counterparts.  So, from that perspective, it is feasible to
   run WebRTC applications in them.  This draft enumerates problems when
   WebRTC application is used on such devices in the above listed
   networks.

   This note focuses on QOS, traffic offload problems and does not
   address other mobile network related topics like power consumption,
   interface switching and congestion control related issues already
   being discussed in [I-D.isomaki-rtcweb-mobile].


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This note uses terminology defined in .[RFC6459]

   UE, MS, MN, and Mobile : The terms UE (User Equipment), MS (Mobile
   Station), MN (Mobile Node), and mobile refer to the devices that are
   hosts with the ability to obtain Internet connectivity via a 3GPP
   network.


3.  Scope

   This document can be used as a tool to design solution(s) mitigating
   the encountered issues.  Describing the use case allows to identify
   what is common between the use cases and then would help during the
   solution design phase.  This note aids WebRTC server designers and
   network architects to facilitate proper deployment of WebRTC in the
   mobile network.  WebRTC server could either be deployed in the Mobile
   Network or WebRTC server deployed in a 3rd party network trusted by
   Mobile Network or Public WebRTC server.


4.  Cellular Networks - QOS

   3GPP has standardized QoS for EPC (Enhanced Packet Core) from Release
   8 [TS23.107]. 3GPP QoS policy configuration defines access agnostic



Reddy, et al.             Expires July 18, 2013                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          WebRTC in Mobile Networks           January 2013


   QoS parameters that can be used to provide service differentiation in
   multi vendor and operator deployments.  The concept of a bearer is
   used as the basic construct for which QoS treatment is applied for
   uplink and downlink packet flows between the MN and gateway
   [TS23.401].  A bearer may have more than one packet filter associated
   and this is called a Traffic Flow Template (TFT).  The IP five tuple
   (IP source address, source port, IP destination, destination port,
   protocol) identifies a packet filter.  TFT has other attributes like
   Type of Service (TOS)/DSCP.  Each MN can have one or multiple bearers
   associated with its registration, each supporting different QoS
   characteristics.  An UpLink Traffic Flow Template (UL TFT) is the set
   of uplink packet filters in a TFT.  A DownLink Traffic Flow Template
   (DL TFT) is the set of downlink packet filters in a TFT.

   The access agnostic QoS parameters associated with each bearer are
   QCI (QoS Class Identifier), ARP (Allocation and Retention Priority),
   MBR (Maximum Bit Rate) and optionally GBR (Guaranteed Bit Rate).  QCI
   is a scalar that defines packet forwarding criteria in the network.
   Mapping of QCI values to DSCP is well understood and GSMA has defined
   standard means of mapping between these scalars [GSMA-IR34].
   Primarily LTE offers two types of bearer: Guaranteed Bit rate bearer
   for real time communication, e.g., Voice calls etc. and Non-
   Guaranteed bit rate, e.g., best effort traffic for web access etc.
   Packets mapped to the same EPS bearer receive the same bearer level
   packet forwarding treatment.

   The Web Real-Time communication (WebRTC) [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview]
   framework provides the protocol building blocks to support direct,
   interactive, real-time communication using audio, video,
   collaboration, games, etc., between two peers' web-browsers.  WebRTC
   application would use Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
   protocol [RFC5245] for gathering candidates, prioritizing them,
   choosing default ones, exchanging them with the remote party, pairing
   them and ordering them into check lists.  Once all of the above have
   been completed then the participating ICE agents can begin a phase of
   connectivity checks and eventually select the pair of candidates that
   will be used for real-time communication.

   Problems with WebRTC application in 3GPP Network are that

4.1.  RTP Session Multiplexing

   o  [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage] in section 4.4 suggests to put
      interactive audio, interactive video over the same 5-tuple.  This
      means that QoS cannot be applied to the 5-tuple, even if it were
      known.  QoS can only be applied by the endpoint by setting DSCP
      appropriately on a per-packet basis.  This problem can possibly be
      solved by the proposal in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-qos].  But 3GPP



Reddy, et al.             Expires July 18, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          WebRTC in Mobile Networks           January 2013


      networks uses TFT's packet filtering information to identify and
      map packets to specific bearers.  So DSCP value in TFT for the
      bearer will not match the DSCP value in the RTP packets sent by
      the UE and 3GPP network may not honor the DSCP value in the RTP
      packets.  In other words both audio/video media streams would be
      mapped to the same EPS bearer thus receiving the same bearer level
      packet forwarding treatement.

   o  [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage] in section 4.4 also proposes not to
      multiplex interactive audio, interactive video over the same
      5-tuple for compatibility with legacy systems.  Mobile Device
      using WebRTC application in 3GPP network should prefer this method
      until a technique to solve the above problem is identified and
      deployed in the 3GPP network.

4.2.  Bearer Resource Modification triggered by UE

   If UE is using Public WebRTC server then the UE can request bearer
   resource modification procedure for an E-UTRAN as explained in
   section 5.4.5 of [TS23.401].  The procedure allows the UE to request
   for a modification of bearer resources (e.g.  Allocation or release
   of resources) for one traffic flow aggregate with a specific QoS
   demand.  Alternatively, the procedure allows the UE to request for
   the modification of the packet filters used for an active traffic
   flow aggregate, without changing QoS.  If accepted by the network,
   the request invokes either the Dedicated Bearer Activation Procedure
   or the Bearer Modification Procedure.

   Problems with this approach are :

   o  When the UE initiates a call using WebRTC application and
      candidate pairs are successfully nominated for each media stream
      then WebRTC application should signal the packet filter (5-tuple),
      QCI and GBR values for each media stream that would initiate
      bearer resource modification or dedicated bearer activation.
      WebRTC application need to be aware of the QCI/GBR values required
      for the media streams.

   o  This means WebRTC application requires API's to indicate OS/Modem
      the packet filters for each media stream to be added, modified or
      deleted.  WebRTC application would need API's to indicate OS/Modem
      the QCI and GBR values for each of the packet filters.  OS/Modem
      would inturn signal this information to the 3GPP network that
      would result in either bearer resource modification or creation of
      Dedicated Bearer Activation Procedure.

   o  WebRTC application may also need API's to trigger the modification
      of the GBR value for existing packet filters.

4.3.  WebRTC server deployed in 3GPP Network

   Currently 3GPP networks prioritize flows by examining the SDP in SIP
   signaling.  As WEBRTC also uses SIP and SDP like signaling, similar
   mechanisms can be used to deploy WebRTC server in 3GPP network.

   o  3GPP network cannot prioritize all a=candidate lines described in
      [RFC5245] until WebRTC server receives an indication of the active
      media path from the controlling ICE agent.  WebRTC server is aware
      of the active media path only after the controlling ICE endpoint
      follows the procedures in Section 11.1 of [RFC5245], specifically
      to send updated offer if the candidates in the m and c lines for
      the media stream (called the DEFAULT CANDIDATES) do not match
      ICE's SELECTED CANDIDATES (also see Appendix B.9 of [RFC5245]).

   o  WebRTC server deployed in 3GPP network would need "Rx" like
      interface to the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF).  The
      PCRF is the policy server in the EPC.  WebRTC server would act as
      "Application Function".  Dynamic PCC (policy and charging control)
      rules are derived within the PCRF from information supplied by the
      AF (such as requested bandwidth for the 5-tuple, Application
      Identity etc).  PCRF forwards PCC rules for the media stream to
      the Policy Charging and enforcement function (PCEF) for Packet
      scheduling, data packet (Diffserv) marking etc to allow QOS to be
      provisioned in the EPC.  Bearers would have be modified/created
      for media streams, assigned and installed on the UE.

4.4.  Deep Packet Inspection

   3GPP has a current work item on "Service Awareness and Privacy
   Policies" that is chartered to add DPI-related extensions to the PCC
   architecture [TS23.203].  The (optional) DPI entity in the EPC is
   called "Traffic Detection Function" (TDF), and it performs
   application detection and reporting of detected application and its
   service data flow description to the Policy Control and Charging
   Rules Function (PCRF) for performing functions such as traffic
   blocking, redirection, policing for selected flows.

   If UE is using Public WebRTC server then

   o  The session signaling between the WebRTC application running in
      the browser and the web server could be using TLS.  Moreover
      WebRTC does not enforce a particular session signaling protocol to
      be used, so network gateways in 3GPP network would fail to inspect
      the signalling to identify the 5-tuple used for media stream and
      thus fail to prioritize media traffic.  Hence derived service
      identification [RFC5897] would not succeed.

Internet-Draft          WebRTC in Mobile Networks           January 2013


   o  Network Gateways by inspecting L7 traffic can only identify RTP
      but fail to distinguish between IPTV vs. Multimedia, Gaming vs.
      Voice Chat, Gaming vs. Voice Chat #2 etc as explained in section
      3.1 - 3.3 of [RFC5897].


5.  Mobility

   The following section lists the potential problems If UE ues Public
   WebRTC server :

5.1.  3GPP SIPTO

   Given the exponential growth in the mobile data traffic, Mobile
   Operators are looking for ways to offload some of the IP traffic
   flows at the nearest access edge that has an Internet peering point.
   This approach results in efficient usage of the mobile packet core
   and helps lower the transport cost.  Since Release 10, 3GPP starts
   supporting of Selected IP Traffic Offload (SIPTO) function defined in
   [TS23.060], [TS23.401].  The SIPTO function allows an operator to
   offload certain types of traffic at a network node close to the UE's
   point of attachment to the access network.  Limited Mobility support
   available with SIPTO is explained in section 2.3.3 of
   [I-D.zuniga-dmm-gap-analysis].

   If SIPTO is carried out in a Traffic offload Function (TOF) entity
   located at the interface of the Radio Access Network i.e.  In the
   path between the Radio stations and the Mobile Gateway (MGW).  The
   TOF decides which traffic to offload and enforces NAT for that
   traffic.  The deployment of a TOF is totally transparent for the UE
   and hence does not know which traffic is subject to TOF (NATed at the
   TOF) and which traffic is processed by the MGW.

   The problem with WebRTC application in such network is that

   o  TOF is not aware of the 5-tuple that will used for media and data
      channels.  ICE agent would gather server reflexive candidates
      using STUN and relayed candidates are obtained through TURN.  If
      STUN messages are offloaded at TOF then UE would learn the
      External IP Address/Port provided by the NAT at TOF.  Similarly
      ICE connectivity checks could also be offloaded at TOF.  If UE
      roams, though host candidate addresses may not change but NAT will
      change resulting in failure to reach the remote peer for the
      existing media and data channels.  If the media and data channels
      are offloaded at the TOF then UE Mobility would result in
      disruption of media and data channel traffic.





Reddy, et al.             Expires July 18, 2013                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          WebRTC in Mobile Networks           January 2013


   o  If UE is using local relayed candidate to reach the remote peer
      and roams out of the coverage of RNC/HNB GW then NAT between UE
      and TURN server changes, so UE cannot use the previous TURN
      allocations and fail to reach the remote peer using local relayed
      candidate.

   [I-D.wing-mmusic-ice-mobility] can be used in such scenarios to
   provide media stream mobility.

5.2.  IPv4 traffic offload for Proxy Mobile IPv6

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (or PMIPv6, or PMIP) is a network-based mobility
   management protocol specified in [RFC5213].  Network-based mobility
   management enables the same functionality as Mobile IP, without any
   modifications to the host's Protocol stack.  With PMIP the host can
   change its point-of-attachment to the Internet without changing its
   IP address.[I-D.ietf-netext-pmipv6-sipto-option] defines a way to
   signal the Traffic Offload capability of a Mobile Access Gateway
   (MAG) to the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in Proxy Mobile IP Networks.
   Mobile access gateway has the ability to offload some of the IPv4
   traffic flows based on the traffic selectors it receives from the
   local mobility anchor.  Using IP Traffic Offload Selector option
   [I-D.ietf-netext-pmipv6-sipto-option] mobile access gateway will
   negotiate IP Flows that can be offloaded to the local access network.

   The problem with WebRTC application in such network is that

   o  MAG and LMA are not aware of the 5-tuple that will used for media
      and data channels.  If STUN messages are offloaded at local access
      network then UE would learn the External IP Address/Port provided
      by the NAT at local access network.  Similarly ICE connectivity
      checks could also be offloaded at local access network.  If UE
      roams out of the coverage of Local Access Network though host
      candidate addresses may not change but NAT will change resulting
      in failure to reach the remote peer for the existing media and
      data channels.  If the media and data channels are offloaded at
      the local access network then UE Mobility will result in
      disruption of media and data channel traffic.

   o  If UE is using local relayed candidate to reach the remote peer
      and roams out of the coverage of Local Access Network then NAT
      between UE and TURN server changes, so UE cannot use the previous
      TURN allocations and fail to reach the remote peer using local
      relayed candidate.

   [I-D.wing-mmusic-ice-mobility] can be used in such scenarios to
   provide media stream mobility.

5.3.  IPv6 Prefix with Mobility

   [I-D.korhonen-dmm-prefix-properties] proposes extensions to Prefix
   Information Option [RFC4861] with a mobility flag bit.  This would
   allow for network based mobility solutions, such as Proxy Mobile IPv6
   [RFC5213] or GTP [TS.29274] to explicitly indicate that their
   prefixes have mobility and therefore, the UE IP stack can make an
   educated selection between prefixes that have mobility and those that
   do not.  WebRTC application for media streams must pick souce
   addresses generated from prefixes with 'M' Flag set to 1 in Prefix
   Information Option.
