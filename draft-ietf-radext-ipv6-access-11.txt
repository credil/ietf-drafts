Internet-Draft             RADIUS IPv6 Access                August 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies additional RADIUS attributes used to support
   configuration of DHCPv6 and/or ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA)
   parameters on a per-user basis.  The attributes, which complement
   those defined in [RFC3162] and [RFC4818], support the following:

   o  Assignment of specific IPv6 addresses to hosts via DHCPv6.

   o  Assignment of an IPv6 DNS server address, via DHCPv6 or Router
      Advertisement [RFC6106].

   o  Configuration of more specific routes to be announced to the user
      via the Route Information Option defined in [RFC4191] Section 2.3.

   o  The assignment of a named delegated prefix pool for use with "IPv6
      Prefix Options for DHCPv6" [RFC3633].

   o  The assignment of a named stateful address pool for use with
      DHCPv6 stateful address assignment [RFC3315].


2.  Deployment Scenarios

   The extensions in this draft are intended to be applicable across a
   wide variety of network access scenarios where Radius is involved.
   One such typical network scenario is illustrated in Figure 1.  It is
   composed of a IP Routing Residential Gateway (RG) or host, a Layer 2
   Access-Node (AN) e.g. a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer -
   DSLAM, one or more IP Network Access Servers (NASes), and an
   Authentication Authorization & Accounting (AAA) server.

Internet-Draft             RADIUS IPv6 Access                August 2012


   In the depicted scenario the NAS may embed a IP addressing protocols
   (e.g. a DHCPv6 server) to handle address assignment to RGs/hosts.
   The RADIUS server authenticates each RG/host and returns to the
   attributes used for authorization and accounting.  These attributes
   can include the host's IPv6 address to be configured via DHCPv6 as
   well as the IPv6 address of a DNS server to be advertised to the
   client.  The name of a prefix pool to be used for DHCPv6 Prefix
   Delegation, or the set of IPv6 routes to be announced to the host can
   also be attributes provided to the NAS from the RADIUS AAA server

   The following sub-sections discuss how these attributes are used in
   more detail.

2.1.  IPv6 Address Assignment

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides a mechanism to assign one or more or non-
   temporary IPv6 addresses to hosts.  To provide a DHCPv6 server
   residing on a NAS with one or more IPv6 addresses to be assigned,
   this document specifies the Framed-IPv6-Address Attribute.

   While [RFC3162] permits an IPv6 address to be specified via the
   combination of the Framed-Interface-Id and Framed-IPv6-Prefix
   attributes, this separation is more natural for use with IPv6CP than
   it is for use with DHCPv6, and the use of a single IPv6 address
   attribute makes for easier processing of accounting records.

   Since DHCPv6 can be deployed on the same network as ICMPv6 stateless
   (SLAAC) [RFC4862], it is possible that the NAS will require both
   stateful and stateless configuration information.  Therefore it is
   possible for the Framed-IPv6-Address, Framed-IPv6-Prefix and Framed-
   Interface-Id attributes [RFC3162] to be included within the same
   packet.  To avoid ambiguity, the Framed-IPv6-Address attribute is
   only used for authorization and accounting of DHCPv6-assigned
   addresses and the Framed-IPv6-Prefix and Framed-Interface-Id
   attributes are used for authorization and accounting of addresses
   assigned via SLAAC.

2.2.  Recursive DNS Servers

   DHCPv6 provides an option for configuring a host with the IPv6
   address of a DNS server.  The IPv6 address of a DNS server can also
   be conveyed to the host using ICMPv6 with Router Advertisements, via
   the experimental [RFC6106] option.  To provide the NAS with the IPv6
   address of a DNS server, this document specifies the DNS-Server-IPv6-
   Address Attribute.

2.3.  IPv6 Route Information

   An IPv6 Route Information option, defined in [RFC4191] is intended to
   be used to inform a host connected to the NAS that a specific route
   is reachable via the NAS.  This is particularly desirable in cases
   where the RG or host are multi-homed to different NASes as shown in
   Figure 1.

   This document specifies the RADIUS attribute that allows the AAA
   system to provision the announcement by the NAS of a specific Route
   Information Option to an accessing host.  The NAS may advertise this
   route using the method defined in [RFC4191], or using other
   equivalent methods.  Any other information, such as preference or
   life-time values, that is to be present in the actual announcement
   using a given method is assumed to be determined by the NAS using
   means not scoped by this document (e.g. local configuration on the
   NAS).

   While the Framed-IPv6-Prefix Attribute defined in [RFC3162] Section
   2.3 causes the route to be advertised in an RA, it cannot be used to
   configure more specific routes.  While the Framed-IPv6-Route
   Attribute defined in [RFC3162] Section 2.5 causes the route to be
   configured on the NAS, and potentially announced via an IP routing
   protocol, depending on the value of Framed-Routing, it does not
   result in the route being announced in an RA.

2.4.  Delegated IPv6 Prefix Pool

   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation [RFC3633] involves a delegating router
   selecting a prefix and delegating it on a temporary basis to a
   requesting router.  The delegating router may implement a number of
   strategies as to how it chooses what prefix is to be delegated to a
   requesting router, one of them being the use of a local named prefix
   pool.  The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool Attribute allows the RADIUS
   server to convey a prefix pool name to a NAS hosting a DHCPv6-PD
   server and acting as a delegated router.

   Since DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation can conceivably be used on the same
   network as SLAAC, it is possible for the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool
   and Framed-IPv6-Pool attributes to be included within the same
   packet.  To avoid ambiguity in this scenario, use of the Delegated-
   IPv6-Prefix-Pool attribute should be restricted to authorization and
   accounting of prefix pools used in DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation and the
   Framed-IPv6-Pool attribute should be used for authorization and
   accounting of prefix pools used in SLAAC.

2.5.  Stateful IPv6 address pool

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides a mechanism to assign one or more or non-
   temporary IPv6 addresses to hosts.  Section 2.1 introduces the
   Framed-IPv6-Address Attribute to be used for providing a DHCPv6
   server residing on a NAS with one or more IPv6 addresses to be
   assigned to the clients.  An alternative way to achieve a similar
   result is for the NAS to select the IPv6 address to be assigned from
   an address pool configured for this purpose on the NAS.  This
   document specifies the Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool attribute to allow
   the RADIUS server to convey a pool name to be used for such stateful
   DHCPv6 based addressing, and any subsequent accounting.


3.  Attributes

   The fields shown in the diagrams below are transmitted from left to
   right.

3.1.  Framed-IPv6-Address

   This Attribute indicates an IPv6 Address that is assigned to the NAS-
   facing interface of the RG/host.  It MAY be used in Access-Accept
   packets, and MAY appear multiple times.  It MAY be used in an Access-
   Request packet as a hint by the NAS to the server that it would
   prefer these IPv6 address(es), but the server is not required to
   honor the hint.  Since it is assumed that the NAS will add a route
   corresponding to the address, it is not necessary for the server to
   also send a host Framed-IPv6-Route attribute for the same address.

   This Attribute can be used by a DHCPv6 process on the NAS to assign a
   unique IPv6 address to the RG/host.

   A summary of the Framed-IPv6-Address Attribute format is shown below.
   The format of the address is as per [RFC3162].

3.2.  DNS-Server-IPv6-Address

   The DNS-Server-IPv6-Address Attribute contains the IPv6 address of a
   recursive DNS server.  This attribute MAY be included multiple times
   in Access-Accept packets, when the intention is for a NAS to announce
   more than one recursive DNS address to an RG/host.  The same order of
   the attributes is expected to be followed in the announcements to the
   client.  The attribute MAY be used in an Access-Request packet as a
   hint by the NAS to the server regarding the DNS IPv6 Address, but the
   Radius server is not required to honor the hint.

   The content of this attribute can be inserted in a DHCPv6 option as
   specified in [RFC3646].

   A summary of the DNS-Server-IPv6-Address Attribute format is given
   below.  The format of the address is as per [RFC3162].

3.4.  Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool

   This Attribute contains the name of an assigned pool that SHOULD be
   used to select an IPv6 delegated prefix for the user.  If a NAS does
   not support multiple prefix pools, the NAS MUST ignore this
   Attribute.  It MAY be used in an Access-Request packet as a hint by

3.5.  Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool

   This Attribute contains the name of an assigned pool that SHOULD be
   used to select an IPv6 address for the user.  If a NAS does not
   support address pools, the NAS MUST ignore this Attribute.  A summary
   of the Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool Attribute format is shown below.
   It MAY be used in an Access-Request packet as a hint by the NAS to
   the server regarding the pool, but the server is not required to
   honor the hint.

   Type

      TBA5 for Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool

   Length

      Length in bytes.  At least 3.

   String

      The string field contains the name of an assigned IPv6 stateful
      address pool configured on the NAS.  The field is not NULL
      (hexadecimal 00) terminated.

3.6.  Table of attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.  The optional
   inclusion of the options in Access Request messages is intended to
   allow for a network access server (NAS) to provide the RADIUS server
   with a hint of the attributes in advance of user authentication,
   which may be useful in cases where a user re-connects or has a static
   address.  The server is under no obligation to honor such hints.

4.  Diameter Considerations

   Given that the Attributes defined in this document are allocated from
   the standard RADIUS type space (see Section 6), no special handling
   is required by Diameter entities.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the use of RADIUS for the purposes of
   authentication, authorization and accounting in IPv6-enabled
   networks.  In such networks, the RADIUS protocol may run either over
   IPv4 or over IPv6.  Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS
   protocol apply to the attributes defined in this document.  Since
   IPsec is natively defined for IPv6, it is expected that running
   RADIUS implementations supporting IPv6 may want to run over IPsec.
   Where RADIUS is run over IPsec and where certificates are used for
   authentication, it may be desirable to avoid management of RADIUS
   shared secrets, so as to leverage the improved scalability of public
   key infrastructure.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the assignment of five new RADIUS Attribute
   Types in the "Radius Types" registry (currently located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types for the following
   attributes:

   o  Framed-IPv6-Address

   o  DNS-Server-IPv6-Address

   o  Route-IPv6-Information

   o  Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool

   o  Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool
