Internet-Draft                  BULK-Time                    August 2013


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Literal numerical values are provided in decimal or hexadecimal as
   appropriate.  Hexadecimal literals are prefixed with "0x" to
   distinguish them from decimal literals.

   BULK bytes sequences and expressions are described with the same
   conventions than used in the BULK 1.0 specification [BULK1]

2.  BULK Time namespace

   The time namespace is an official namespace identified by the UUID
   <urn:uuid:a0236aea-9923-511d-b755-66be75151201> (BULK, "Time passed,
   which, basically, is its job.").  It provides a standard way to
   serialize some formats used to express time, mainly those from ISO
   8601 [ISO8601].

2.1.  Types

   This specification defines the following types:

   Int123  a sequence of type "Int", "Int Int" or "Int Int Int"

   IntsF  a sequnce of one or more expressions, all of which MUST be of
      type "Int", except the last which can also be of type "Float"

2.2.  ISO 8601

   Note that BULK serializations of single points in time are notably
   bigger than a string containing their ISO 8601 notation.  Such times
   SHOULD be serialized as offsets against an epoch (like Julian date or
   Unix time), except where simplicity of implementation is wanted.

2.2.1.  Calendar date

   name  "0x1" (mnemonic: "calendar" )

   shape  "( calendar Int123 )"

   This serialize dates like 1999, 2001-06 or 2013-08-06.

   Types: "ISOTime", "Date"

2.2.2.  Week date

   name  "0x2" (mnemonic: "weekdate" )

   shape  "( weekdate Int123 )"

   This serialize dates like 1979, 1987-W06 or 2012-W52-1.

   Types: "ISOTime", "Date"

2.2.3.  Ordinale date

   name  "0x3" (mnemonic: "ordinal" )

   shape  "( ordinal Int Int )"

   This serialize dates like 2004-006 or 2000-366.

   Types: "ISOTime", "Date"

2.2.4.  Time of day

   name  "0x4" (mnemonic: "time-of-day" )

   shape  "( time-of-day {components}:IntsF )"

   This serialize times like 22, 13:45 or 06:34:57,3. {components} MUST
   contain from 1 to 3 expressions.

   Types: "ISOTime", "ISOTimeOfDay"

2.2.5.  Point in time

   name  "0x5" (mnemonic: "point" )

   shape  "( point Date ISOTimeOfDay )"

   This serialize dates like 2005-W34-7T19:45.

   Type: "ISOTime"

2.2.6.  UTC time

   name  "0x6" (mnemonic: "zulu" )

   shape  "( zulu ISOTime )"

   This serialize times like 2005-W34-7T19:45Z or 11:53:23Z.

   Type: "ISOTime"

2.2.7.  Offset time

   name  "0x7" (mnemonic: "offset" )

   shape  "( offset ISOTimeOfDay ISOTime )"

   This serialize times like 2005-W34-7T19:45+02 or 11:53-01:30.

   Type: "ISOTime"

2.2.8.  Durations

   0x8  "years"

   0x9  "months"

   0xA  "days"

   0xB  "hours"

   0xC  "minutes"

   0xD  "seconds"

   0xE  "weeks"

   All durations have the same shape: "( Ref {components}:IntsF )". {
   components} must contain from 1 to respectively 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and
   1 expressions.

   Type: "ISODuration"

2.2.9.  Interval

   name  "0xF" (mnemonic: "interval" )

   shape  "( interval ISOTime ISOTime )"

   shape  "( interval ISOTime ISODuration )"

   name  "0x11" (mnemonic: "julian" )

   shape  "( julian {num}:Number )"

   It serializes the Julian Day Number (if {num} has type Int) or the
   Julian Date (if {num} has type Float).

2.4.  Unix time

   name  "0x12" (mnemonic: "unix-time" )

   shape  "( unix-time Number )"

   It serializes the number of seconds since or until the Unix epoch
   (with microsecond or nanosecond precision if the number has type
   Float).

2.5.  Star Trek TNG stardate

   name  "0x13" (mnemonic: "tng-stardate" )

   shape  "( tng-stardate Int Int )"
