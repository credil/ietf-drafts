                Home Network Front End Naming Delegation
             draft-mglt-front-end-naming-delegation-00.txt

Abstract

   This document proposes a Naming Delegation Architecture that makes
   possible End Users to reach the hosts or services of their Home
   Network using Names instead of IP addresses.

   This document shows how the Naming Delegation between the CPE and the
   ISP can be set so the CPE is not exposed on the Internet.  This
   document describes an Naming Architecture where ISPs provide Front
   End Delegating DNS Servers whereas the CPEs constitute a Back End
   Network of Delegated DNS Servers.  All DNS queries for any Home
   Network are addressed to the Delegating Front End Server.  The
   response is expected to be stored on a CPE, and the Front End
   Delegating DNS Server sends a DNS Query to that CPE before answering
   to the initial DNS query.

   The negotiation between the CPE and the ISP is using DHCP Options.
   This document provides options so Front End Delegating and the
   Delegated DNS Servers configure their respective Zone files and so
   that CPEs restrict access and protect themselves from unauthorized
   DNS Queries.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation] describes the Naming Delegation
   Architecture that makes possible Services and Objects of a Home
   Network to be globally reachable with Names on the Internet.  For
   that purpose, the Costumer Premise Equipment (CPE) hosts the
   authoritative DNS Server of the Home Network.  The zone associated to
   the Home Network ("my-homenet") is a subzone of a zone managed by the
   ISP ("example.").  This zone is attached to the global DNS
   Architecture.  Because the ISP delegates the Naming service to the
   CPE, we call the DNS server responsible for "example." the Delegating
   DNS Server, and the DNS server responsible for "my-homenet.example."
   the Delegated DNS Server.  The Delegated DNS Server runs on the CPE,
   and [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation] describes how the CPE can
   automatically set the Naming Delegation between the Delegated and the
   Delegating DNS Server.  Necessary pieces of information to configure
   the respective DNS Zones are exchanged between the DHCP client of the
   CPE and the ISP DHCP Server through DHCP Options.

   The resulting Naming Delegation Architecture
   [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation] results in a CPE hosting a Service on
   the Internet.  CPEs have not been designed for heavy load, and, as a
   result, the Delegating exposes the Home Network to potential Deny of
   Service attacks.  The Front End Naming Delegation Architecture
   proposed in this document is an alternative to the Naming Delegation
   Architecture [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation] where the ISP provides
   Front End Delegating Servers that handles the whole DNS traffic.  The
   CPE remains responsible for the zone "my-homenet.example.", but only
   responds to DNS queries sent by the Front End Delegating Servers.
   For this reason we call the CPE Delegated DNS Server the Back End
   Delegated DNS Server.

   The Front End Naming Delegation Architecture can be seen as providing
   a Authoritative DNS Server for all the Home Networks: the Front End
   Delegating DNS Server.  However this Authoritative Server distributes
   the Zone between multiple nodes (the CPE).  The CPE constitutes the
   Back End Network.  The Front End Delegating DNS Server receives DNS
   query from the Internet, and to respond requires to retrieve this
   information on the CPE hosting this information.  In this document,
   the Front End Delegating DNS Server uses the DNS protocol to retrieve
   this information from the CPE.  Other protocols may have been chosen.

   The Front End Naming Delegation Architecture is based on the Naming
   Delegation Architecture [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation] and addresses
   the same requirements.  It addresses the Deny of Service Security
   issue.  On the other hand, it requires the ISP to provide an adapted
   infrastructure, and that all DNS traffic is (partly) handled by the
   ISP.  The document shows how the CPE can be configured automatically
   and be part of the Front End Naming Delegation Architecture.

   In this document we only considered IPv6 and DHCP.  As such DHCP MUST
   be understood as DHCPv6.  We also assume the reader has read
   [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation]


3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in
   [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation], and introduces the following
   terminology:

   - Front End Delegating DNS Server or Delegating DNS Server:  The DNS
         Server of the ISP that handles with the DNS queries addressed
         to the Home Network.

   - Back End Delegated DNS Server or Delegated DNS Server:  CPE are
         hosting a DNS Service

   - Front End Delegating Information:  Information like FQDNs and IP
         addresses of the Front End Delegating DNS Servers.  These
         pieces of information are provided from the ISP DHCP Server to
         the CPE so it can properly configure its DNS zone file.

   - Delegating Authorized Resolvers:  The hosts that are authorized to
         send DNS queries to the CPE.  These Resolvers can be the Front
         End Delegating DNS Servers, but we keep these functions
         independent since some ISP may use dedicated Interfaces for the
         Front End Delegating DNS Server and for the Delegating
         Authorized Resolvers.


4.  Front End Naming Delegation Architecture Overview

4.1.  Home Network Naming Architecture Requirements

   The Home Network Naming Requirements for the Naming Delegation listed
   in [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation] are:






Cloetens, et al.         Expires January 4, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  Home Network Front End Naming Delegation       July 2012


   - 1: Centralized Naming Configuration:  The CPE is responsible to
         bind Names and IP addresses for the whole Home Network.

   - 2: Automatic Configuration:  The CPE MUST be able to set the Naming
         architecture when plugged, with minimum configuration from the
         End User.

   - 3: Advanced Configuration enable:  The CPE enables advanced
         specific configurations.

   - 4: Privacy Protection By Design:  The Names and the Home Network IP
         address plan is administrated by the CPE and are not
         communicated to the ISP.  This prevents the ISP to be aware of
         the hosts, Services and Objects that compose the Home Network.

   - 5: Make the Home Network Naming Architecture Scalable:  The Naming
         Architecture MUST be scalable and designed to handle a large
         increase of Objects, Services and hosts in each Home Networks.

   The Naming Delegation Architecture fulfills these requirements, and
   we consider this architecture as the base architecture.  However,
   this architecture major drawback is that the CPE hosts the Delegated
   DNS Server.  CPE are usually not designed to handle heavy traffic,
   and thus are sensitive to DoS attacks.  The Front End Naming
   Delegation Architecture adds one requirement to the currently
   designed Naming Delegation Architecture [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation]:

   - 6: the Naming Architecture MUST be protected by the ISP
   Infrastructure:  The CPE MUST NOT expose the Home Network Naming
         service to DoS attacks.  The ISP MUST be able to provide the
         necessary infrastructure that handle DoS attacks, or heavy
         loads.

   In order to match Requirement 6, the Front End Naming delegation
   Architecture introduces Front End DNS Delegating Server that handles
   with all DNS traffic.  This means that all DNS queries that concern
   the Home Network are addressed to the Front End DNS Delegating Server
   of the ISP and are not addressed to the CPE.  CPEs belong to the Back
   End DNS Network.

   The Front End DNS Naming Delegation Architecture fulfills all the
   above Requirements.  However, Requirement 4 needs to be balanced
   against Requirement 6.  Requirement 6 requires the ISP to handle all
   DNS queries that concern the Home Network.  This makes the ISP aware
   of all queried Services, Objects and hosts in the Home Network.  This
   may, in that sense, reduces the Privacy of the Home Network compared
   to the Naming Delegation Architecture.  In fact with the Naming
   Delegation Architecture, the DNS query is directly sent to the CPE

   when the DNS client has the IP address of the CPE in its cache.  In
   that case, the ISP is not aware of the existence of the queried FQDN.
   However, if the DNS client does not have the IP address of the CPE,
   then the DNS query is sent first to the ISP Delegating Server.  In
   this latter case, the Front End DNS Naming Delegation Architecture
   does not provide less privacy.

4.2.  Front End Naming Delegation Architecture Description

   Figure 1 shows how the Resolution is performed.  In [1], the Resolver
   sends a DNS query to the Front End Delegated Server for the host
   "hots1.my-homenet.example.".  The Front End Delegated Server does not
   have the response in its cache or in its zone file.  The Front End
   Delegating DNS Server MUST send a query to the Back End Delegated DNS
   Sever.  The IP address of the Back End Delegated DNS Sever MUST NOT
   be revealed to the Resolver, for example by setting the NS field in
   the DNS Zone File.  In Figure 1, we mentioned the Delegated Server
   Information Database where this IP address is stored.  The Front End
   Delegating Server sends the DNS(SEC) query to the Back End Delegated
   Server hosting the zone "my-homenet.example.".  The source IP address
   used is one the Delegating Authorized Resolvers IP addresses.  This
   query is represented in [2].  The Back End Delegated Server responds
   in [3] with the DNS(SEC) Response.  Note that the "AUTHORITY" and
   "ADDITIONAL SECTION" of the DNS response MUST indicate the FQDN and
   the IP addresses of the Front End Delegated DNS Server.  These pieces
   of information have been provided by the ISP DHCP Server with the
   Front End Delegating Information DHCP Option.  The CPE can also be
   configured to respond without these fields.  Finally in [4], the
   Front End Delegating Server forwards the DNS(SEC) response to the
   Resolver.  "AUTHORITY" and "ADDITIONAL SECTION" fields MUST be filled
   in appropriately.

Figure 1:  DNS Resolution with the Home Network Delegating Architecture

4.3.  Front End Naming Delegation Configuration

   Figure 2 describes the Interactions between the CPE and the ISP DHCP
   Server.

   Similarly to [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation], the CPE hosts a DHCP
   Server (DHCP_SRV) that is used to assign IP addresses and FQDNs to
   the Hosts of the Home Network.  In this document we considered DHCP,
   but other protocols can also be used in combination with DHCP or
   instead of DHCP.  The CPE also has a DHCP Client (DHCP_CLT) that is
   used to exchange information with the ISP DHCP Server.  This document
   describes how these exchanges properly configure the Front End Naming
   Delegation Architecture.  The CPE also hosts a Authoritative DNS
   Server (DNS_SRV) that is responsible of the subzone associated to the
   Home Network.  This Authoritative DNS Server is called the Back End
   Delegated Server.  At last the CPE also has a Firewall (FIREWALL),
   that can be configured with security Policies.  In this document, the
   CPE is not expected to received DNS queries from any other peer but
   the Front End Delegation DNS Servers, that are in the ISP Network.

   In Figure 2. the CPE sends a DHCP Request for a Front End Naming
   Delegation Architecture (DELEGATED_DNS_ARCHITECTURE).  Similarly to



Cloetens, et al.         Expires January 4, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  Home Network Front End Naming Delegation       July 2012


   the Naming Delegation Architecture, the CPE provides the necessary
   information so the ISP can derive the IP address of the Back End
   Delegated DNS Server (DELEGATED_DNS_ADDR_INFO).  If the CPE wants a
   DNSSEC Delegation to be set it also provides the Delegation of
   Signing Information (DS).  In our case, the CPE also sends a request
   for a Prefix Delegation (IA_PD).

   To the difference with [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation], the IP address
   of the Back End Delegated DNS Server is not mentioned in the Zone
   file of the Front End Delegating DNS Server.  In this document, the
   Back End Delegated DNS Server is not expected to receive any DNS
   query from anyone but the Front End Delegating DNS Server.  For DNS
   Resolvers, the only Authoritative DNS Server they are aware of is the
   Front End Delegating DNS Server.

   Similarly to [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation], the ISP DHCP Server
   provides the CPE the IP Prefix so the CPE can configure its Prefix
   Delegation.  To set the DNS(SEC) Naming Delegation the ISP DHCP
   Server indicates the type of Naming Delegation Architecture agreed
   between the CPE and the ISP DHCP Server (DELEGATED_DNS_ARCHITECTURE).
   In addition, the ISP DHCP Server, provides the Delegated Domain
   (DELEGATED_DOMAIN) as well as the IP addresses and FQDNs of the Front
   End Delegating DNS Servers (FRONT_END_DELEGATING_INFO).  These pieces
   of information are necessary to configure the zone file of the Home
   Network.  In fact the zone file MUST be configured with the Front End
   Delegating Server as the authoritative servers.  In addition, the ISP
   DHCP Server may also provide the IP addresses or subnet prefix of the
   Delegating Authorized Resolvers (DELEGATING_AUTH_RESOLVERS).  These
   Resolvers are the only hosts supposed to send DNS queries to the CPE.
   DNS queries from any other IP address MUST be discarded.

   Upon receiving these pieces of information, the Front End Delegating
   Server and the Back End Delegated Server configure their Zones.  In
   addition the CPE also configures its Firewall, so to discard any DNS
   queries but those emitted from the Delegating Authorized Resolvers.

   Figure 2:  Front End Naming Delegation Architecture

4.4.  Difference between the Front End Delegating DNS Server and
      traditional DNS Recursive DNS Server

   From Figure 1, one may assimilate the Front End Delegating DNS Server
   to a Recursive DNS Resolver.  The main differences are:

   - 1.  The Front End Delegating DNS Server only proceeds to Resolution
         for the FQDNs that are hosted in one of the Back End Delegated
         DNS Servers.

   - 2.  The Back End Delegated DNS Servers are not Public DNS.  More
         especially, the Delegated DNS Server may have a public IP
         address, but the DNS Service is not provided for any Resolver
         but the authorized Resolvers.

   As a result, the Front End Delegating DNS Server is a mixed mode
   between Authoritative and Recursive DNS Server.  As an Authoritative
   Server, the Response [4] in figure 1 MUST have a Authoritative Answer
   (AA) bit set, which indicates the Response is from an Authoritative
   Server.  Then the Resolution [2] and [3] in figure 1 MUST be
   processed even if the Recursion Desired (RD) bit is not set in the
   DNS query [1].

   It is also recommended that the Front End Delegating DNS Server
   provides the Authoritative and Additional Section of the Response in
   [4], without considering the sections of [3].  In other word, it is
   recommended not to forward these section from [3], and the CPE should

Internet-Draft  Home Network Front End Naming Delegation       July 2012


   be configured not to provide these sections in [3].

4.5.  How the Front End Configuration impacts the CPE

   Figure 2 shows that the ISP DHCP Server provides the IP addresses of
   the Front End Delegating DNS Server as well as the Name of the Front
   End Delegating DNS Server.  These are the information the Back End
   Delegated DNS Server MUST put in its Zone file.  More especially in
   the NS fields.

   Figure 2 also shows that the ISP DHCP Server provides the CPE the IP
   addresses or subnet prefix of the Authorized Delegating Resolvers.
   These are the IP addresses authorized to send DNS queries that should
   not be discarded on the WAN Interface.  Any other DNS query on the
   WAN should be discarded.  These rules are set by the Firewall as
   represented in Figure 2.

   The Firewall rules does not prevent the CPE to be a DNS forwarder or
   a DNS Resolver for the hosts of the Home Network.  In fact the CPE
   can still receive DNS queries from the LAN Interface.  The issue is
   that the CPE may provide Multiple DNS Services.  In this document, we
   consider the CPE provides at least a DNS Authoritative servers on its
   WAN Interface for the Authorized Delegating Resolvers.  For the LAN
   Interface, the CPE may be configured in various ways, depending on
   the ISP DNS Infrastructure.  A first configuration consists in
   configuring the CPE LAN DNS Service into a DNS forwarder.  In that
   case, the CPE DHCP server of the Home Network provides an IP address
   of the CPE for the DNS Resolver.  DNS queries for the Home Network
   are answered by the CPE, others are forwarded to the Resolver of the
   ISP.  This resolver is provided via DHCP.  Another alternative
   consists in configuring the CPE as a Recursive DNS Server.  Without
   any specific configurations, DNS queries for the Home Network are
   sent to the Front End Delegating DNS Server.  Optimization may be
   done to bypass the Front End Delegating DNS Server for the Home
   Network Zone and are CPE or software implementation specific.


5.  Protocol Exchange

5.1.  CPE Request Creation and Transmission for the Front End Naming
      Delegation Architecture

   When the CPE wants to set a Front End Naming Delegation Architecture,
   it requests this set up to the ISP DHCP Server.  For that purpose, we
   consider two new naming-delegation-action:
   SET_FRONT_END_NAMING_DELEGATION_WITH_DNS when the delegation is only
   performed with DNS or SET_FRONT_END_NAMING_DELEGATION_WITH_DNSSEC if
   the CPE wants a DNSSEC delegation.  These naming-delegation-actions

Internet-Draft  Home Network Front End Naming Delegation       July 2012


   are proposed in the Delegated DNS Architecture DHCP Option
   (OPTION_DELEGATED_DNS_ARCHITECTURE).  Then, the CPE proceeds as
   described in [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation].

5.2.  ISP DHCP Server Responding to the CPE Request for the Front End
      Naming Delegation Architecture

   When the DHCP Server receives a Delegated DNS Architecture DHCP
   Option (OPTION_DELEGATED_DNS_ARCHITECTURE), Delegated DNS Address
   Information DHCP Option (OPTION_DELEGATED_DNS_ADDR_INFO) or a
   Delegation of Signing DHCP Option (OPTION_DS), the DHCP Server
   proceeds as described in [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation].

   In addition, when the naming-delegation-action is set to
   SET_FRONT_END_NAMING_DELEGATION_WITH_DNS or
   SET_FRONT_END_NAMING_DELEGATION_WITH_DNSSEC, the DHCP Server MUST
   include in the Response the two additional DCHP Options.  The Front
   End Delegating Information DHCP Option
   (OPTION_FRONT_END_DELEGATING_INFO) which indicates the FQDNs of the
   Front End Delegating Servers and their associated IP addresses.
   Then, it also MUST include the Delegating Authorized Resolvers DHCP
   Option (OPTION_DELEGATING_AUTH_RESOLVERS) which indicates the IP
   addresses or subnet prefixes of the Authorized Delegating Resolvers.

   Note that Naming Delegation is set differently for the Front End
   Naming Delegation Architecture and for the Naming Delegation
   Architecture.  More specifically, in the Front End Naming Delegation,
   the ISP DHCP Server MUST NOT make the IP address of the Delegated DNS
   Server public in its zone file.

5.3.  CPE Receiving the ISP DHCP Response for the Front End Naming
      Delegation Architecture

   Similarly to [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation], if the CPE has not
   received all expected DHCP Options, or cannot proceed to the
   configuration of the Naming Delegation Architecture, it MUST either
   clear the Naming Delegation settings or proceed to the appropriated
   settings.

   When the CPE receives the Delegating Authorized Resolvers DHCP Option
   (OPTION_DELEGATING_AUTH_RESOLVERS), the CPE may update its Firewall
   rules.  The Front End Delegating Information DHCP Option
   (OPTION_FRONT_END_DELEGATING_INFO) is used to configure the DNS zone
   of the Home Network.

   The CPE may receive the Delegating Authorized Resolvers or the Front
   End Delegating Information DHCP Option from the ISP DHCP Server that
   are not the response to a Delegated DNS Architecture DHCP Option.

Internet-Draft  Home Network Front End Naming Delegation       July 2012


   This may happen if the ISP DHCP Server is updating or modifying its
   Front End Delegating DNS Server or the associated Delegating
   Authorized Resolvers.  In that case, the CPE MUST make sure the
   message provides from the ISP DHCP Server and updates its Firewall
   rules as well as its DNS zone file.


6.  DHCP Options

   The options detailed in this section are

   - Delegated DNS Architecture (OPTION_DELEGATED_DNS_ARCHITECTURE):  is
         used by the DHCP Client on the CPE to inform how the Naming
         Delegation Architecture should be configured.  In return, it is
         used by the ISP DHCP Server to report the Status Code.

   - Front End Delegating Information DHCP Option
   (OPTION_FRONT_END_DELEGATING_INFO):  is used by the ISP DHCP Server
         to provide the CPE the FQDN and IP addresses of the
         Authoritative DNS Server of the Home Network Zone file.  These
         Authoritative DNS Servers are the Front End DNS Server.

   - Delegating Authorized Resolvers DHCP Option
   (OPTION_DELEGATING_AUTH_RESOLVERS):  is used by the DHCP Server to
         provide the CPE the IP addresses or subnet prefixes of the
         Delegating Authorized Resolvers.  These are the resolvers
         authorized to send DNS(SEC) queries.

6.1.  Delegated DNS Architecture Option

   The Delegated DNS Architecture DHCP Option is defined in
   [I-D.mglt-naming-delegation].  This document adds two new naming-
   delegation-actions defined below:

   - SET_FRONT_END_NAMING_DELEGATION_WITH_DNS - 2 - :  Indicates that
         the DHCP Server MUST set the Front End Naming Delegation
         Architecture with only DNS, and MUST NOT consider DNSSEC
         Delegation.

   - SET_FRONT_END_NAMING_DELEGATION_WITH_DNSSEC - 3 - :  Indicates that
         the DHCP Server MUST set the Front End Naming Delegation
         Architecture with DNSSEC.
