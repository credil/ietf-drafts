1.  Introduction

   PCP (Port Control Protocol) [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] is used for an IPv6
   or IPv4 host to control how incoming IPv6 or IPv4 packets are
   translated and forwarded by a network address translator (NAT) or by
   a simple firewall.  It also allows a host to optimize its outgoing
   NAT keepalive messages.

   In order to provide integrity protection for PCP messages, a message
   authentication mechanism for PCP is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-authentication].  Three components are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-authentication]: (1) PCP options for providing per-
   packet origin authentication, integrity and replay protection, (2)
   PCP Security Association (SA) for generating the aforementioned
   options, and (3) PCP options for generating PCP SA from execution of
   EAP authentication.

   The third component seems to define a new EAP lower-layer within PCP.
   In this document, PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for
   Network Access) [RFC5191] is proposed instead of defining a new EAP
   lower-layer.  This draft along with other two components described in
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-authentication] provides a complete solution which
   otherwise will duplicate the work of transporting EAP over UDP.  The
   proposed solution can run over a single PCP port.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Establishing a PCP SA

   A PaC (PANA Client) on the PCP client node initiates PANA
   authentication over the PCP port number (To be assigned for PCP
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]) prior to sending an authenticated PCP message.
   The initiation is requested by the PCP client.  We assume that a PAA
   (PANA Authentication Agent) is implemented on each PCP server that
   supports authenticated PCP messages.  Therefore, the PCP server's IP
   address is used as the address of the PAA.  The PANA authentication
   for establishing a PCP SA is dedicated to the PCP usage only.

   PANA authentication for establishing a PCP SA is conducted using PCP
   AUTH Opcode.  An AUTH request or response carries a PANA PDU (PANA
   header and payload) in its Opcode-specific information



Ohba, et al.             Expires April 12, 2013                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          PANA Encapsulation in PCP           October 2012


   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].  Any PANA message sent by the PCP client is
   carried in an AUTH request, and any PANA message sent by the PCP
   server is carried in an AUTH response.  The PCP retransmission
   mechanism SHOULD NOT be used for Auth Opcode to avoid double-layer
   retransmission.

   If the PCP server does not support AUTH Opcode but it receives an
   AUTH request, it returns an "UNSUPP_OPCODE" result code.

   If the PCP server that requires authenticated PCP message receives an
   unauthenticated PCP request other than an AUTH request, it returns an
   "AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED" result code.

   Upon successful PANA authentication, the message authentication key
   for PCP message is derived from the EAP MSK as follows:

   PCP_AUTH_KEY = prf+(MSK, "IETF PCP" | SID | KID)

   where where | denotes concatenation.

   o  The prf+ function is defined in IKEv2 [RFC5996].  The pseudo-
      random function to be used for the prf+ function is negotiated
      using PRF-Algorithm AVP in the initial PANA-Auth-Request and PANA-
      Auth-Answer exchange with 'S' (Start) bit set, as defined in
      [RFC5191].

   o  "IETF PCP" is the ASCII code representation of the non-NULL
      terminated string (excluding the double quotes around it).

   o  SID is a four-octet PANA Session Identifier [RFC5191].

   o  KID is the content of the Key-ID AVP [RFC5191] associated with the
      MSK.

   The same integrity algorithm used for the PANA session MUST be used
   for PCP message authentication.

   The PCP_AUTH_KEY and its associated parameters (i.e., the IP
   addresses of the PCP client and PCP server, PANA Session ID, Key ID,
   message authentication algorithm and lifetime) are passed from the
   PAA application to the PCP server application on the same PCP server
   device, and also passed from the PaC application to the PCP client
   application on the same PCP client node, using an API.  The API can
   be implementation-specific, and therefore is not specified in this
   document.  The PANA Session ID and Key ID are used in the
   corresponding fields (Session ID, Key ID) of the Authentication Tag
   Option.

   Once a PCP SA is established, any PCP message that does not contain a
   valid Authentication Tag and a fresh Nonce under the current PCP SA
   MUST be silently discarded.

   The PCP SA MUST be immediately deleted when the corresponding PANA SA
   is deleted.  The PCP SA SHALL remain as long as the corresponding
   PANA SA exists.


3.  Security Considerations

   The key provisioning mechanism described in this document provides a
   cryptographic binding between a PANA session and a PCP SA based on
   using the PANA session identifier and key identifier in the
   PCP_AUTH_KEY derivation function.

   For EAP channel binding [RFC6677], it is required for a PAA to
   distinguish whether PANA authentication is conducted for network
   access authentication or PCP authentication.  Such a distinction can
   be made using the assigned port number over which the PANA
   authentication is conducted, namely, the PANA authentication is
   conducted for PCP authentication when the port number is the PCP port
   number (to be assigned), and it is for network access authentication
   when the port number is the PANA port number (716).  How the
   corresponding information is conveyed from the PAA to the
   authentication server is outside the scope of this document.


4.   IANA Considerations

   A new PCP Opcode for AUTH needs to be allocated.  The usage of the
   AUTH Opcode is described in Section 2.

   A new result code for "AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED" needs to be
   allocated.  The usage of the "AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED" result code is
   described in Section 2.
