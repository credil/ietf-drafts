Internet-Draft        Making BGP filtering an habit       September 2012


1.  Introduction

   It is common practice for network operators to propagate overlapping
   prefixes along with the prefixes that they originate.  On the other
   hand, it can be beneficial for some Autonomous Systems (ASes) to
   filter overlapping prefixes (such operation needs to be translated
   into various requirements in order to be automatically performed)
   DRAFT-WHITE [1].

   BGP makes independent, policy driven decisions for the selection of
   the best path to be used for a given IP prefix.  However, in the data
   plane, the longest prefix match forwarding rule "precedes" the
   application of such policies.  The existence of a prefix p' that is
   more specific than a prefix p in the Routing Information Base (RIB)
   will indeed let packets whose destination matches p' be forwarded
   according to the next hop selected as best for p' (the overlapping
   prefix).  This process takes place by disregarding the policies
   applied in the control plane for the selection of the best next-hop
   for p (the covering prefix).  When overlapping prefixes are filtered
   and packets are forwarded according to the covering prefix, the
   discrepancy in the routing policies applied both covering and
   overlapping prefixes can lead to a violation of policies of Internet
   Service Providing (ISPs) still holding a path towards the overlapping
   prefix.

   This document presents examples of such potential threats, and
   discusses solutions to the problem.  The objective of this draft is
   to enable the use of prefix filtering while making the routing
   community aware of the cases where the effects of filtering might
   turn to be negative for the business of ISPs.

   The rest of the document is organized as follows: Section 2 describes
   some cases in which it is favorable for an AS to filter overlapping
   prefixes.  In Section 3, we provide some scenarios in which the
   filtering of overlapping prefixes lead to policy violations of other
   ASes.  Section 4 and Section 5 introduce some techniques that ASes
   can use for, respectively, detect and react to policy violations.


2.  Filtering overlapping prefixes

   There are different scenarios where filtering an overlapping prefix
   is relevant to the operations of an AS.  In this section, we
   illustrate examples of these scenarios.  We differentiate cases in
   which the filtering is performed locally from those where the
   filtering is triggered remotely, by using BGP communities.  These
   scenarios will be used as a base in Section 3 for describing side
   effects bound with such practices, notably policy violations in the

   ASes surrounding the AS applying the procedure.

2.1.  Local filtering

   Let us first analyze the scenario depicted in Figure 1.  AS1 and AS2
   are two large autonomous systems spanning a large geographical area
   and peering in 3 different physical locations.  Let AS1 announce
   prefix 10.0.0.0/22 through the sessions established between the two
   ASes over all peering links.  Additionally, let us define that there
   is part of AS1's network which exclusively uses prefix 10.0.0.0/24
   and which is closer to one specific peering point than to others
   (right peering link).  With the purpose of receiving the traffic from
   AS2 to prefix 10.0.0.0/24 on the right peering link, AS1 could
   announce the overlapping prefix on this specific peering point.  At
   the time of the establishment of the peering, it can be defined by
   both ASes that hot potato routing would happen in both directions of
   traffic.  In this scenario, it becomes relevant for AS2 to enforce
   such practice by detecting the described situations and automatically
   issue the appropriate filtering.  In this case, by implementing these
   automatic procedures, AS2 would detect and filter prefix 10.0.0.0/24.

   There are other cases in which there could exist a need for local
   filtering.  For example, a dual homed AS receiving an overlapping
   prefix from only one of its providers.  Figure 2 depicts a simple
   example of this case.

                Figure 2: Basic scenario local filtering 2

   In this scenario, prefix 10.0.0.0/22 is advertised by AS1 to AS2 and
   AS3.  Both AS propagate the prefix to AS4.  Additionally, AS1
   advertises prefix 10.0.0.0/24 to AS3, which subsequently propagates
   the prefix to AS4. 10.0.0.0/22 is a covering prefix for 10.0.0.0/24.

   It is possible that AS4 resolves to filter the more specific prefix
   10.0.0.0/24.  One potential motivation could be the economical
   preference of the path via AS2 over AS3.  Another feasible reason is
   the existence of a technical policy by AS4 of aggregating incoming
   prefixes longer than /23.

   The above examples illustrate two of the many motivations to
   configure routing within an AS with the aim of ignoring more specific
   routes.  Operators have reported applying these filters in a manual
   fashion INIT7-RIPE63 [2].  The relevance of such practice led to
   investigate automated filtering procedures (DRAFT-WHITE [1]).

2.2.  Remotely triggered filtering

   ISPs can tag the BGP paths that they propagate to neighboring ASes
   with communities, so as to tweak the propagation behavior of the ASes

   that handle such propagated paths [on_BGP_communities].

   Some ISPs allow their direct and indirect customers to use such
   communities in order to let the receiving AS not export the path to
   some selected neighboring AS.  By combining communities, the prefix
   could be advertised only to a given peer of the AS providing this
   feature.  Figure 3 illustrates an example of this case.

                                  /  AS1    \
                                  |         |
                                   \       /

                   Figure 3: Remote triggered filtering

   AS2 and AS3 are peers.  Both ASes are providers of AS1.  For traffic
   engineering purposes, AS1 could use communities to prevent AS2 from
   announcing prefix 10.0.0.0/24 to AS3.

   Such technique is useful for operators to tweak routing decisions in
   order to align with complex transit policies.  We will see in the
   later sections that by producing the same effect as filtering, they
   can also lead to policy violations at other, distant, ASes.


3.  Uses of more specific prefix filtering that violate policies

   We describe in this section three configuration scenarios which lead
   to the violation of the policies of an AS.  Note that these examples
   do not capture all the cases where such policy violation can take
   place.  More examples will be provided in the future revisions of
   this document.

3.1.  Violation caused by Local filtering

   In this section we describe cases in which an AS locally filters an
   overlapping prefix.  We show how, depending on the situations of BGP
   policies, this decision leads to the violation of the policies of
   neighboring ASes.

   We start by describing the basic scenario of this case in Figure 4.

   announcing a covering prefix, 10.0.0.0/22, and an overlapping prefix
   10.0.0.0/24 to its providers.  In the initial setup, AS2 and AS3 will
   announce the two prefixes to their peers and transit providers.  AS4
   receives both prefixes from its peer (AS2) and transit provider
   (AS5).

3.1.2.  Violation of Policy - Case 1

   In the next scenarios, we show that if AS4 filters the incoming
   overlapping prefix from AS5, there is a situation in which the
   policies of other ASes are violated.

   Let us assume the scenario illustrated in Figure 5.  For this case,
   AS1 only propagates the overlapping prefix to AS3.  AS4 receives the
   overlapping prefix only from its traffic provider, AS5.

   The described example places AS4 in a situation in which it would be
   favorable for it to filter the announcement of prefix 10.0.0.0/24
   from AS5.  Subsequently, traffic originating from AS4 to prefix
   10.0.0.0/24 is forwarded to AS2.  As AS2 receives the more specific
   prefix from AS3, traffic originating from AS4 and heading to prefix
   10.0.0.0/24 follows the path AS4-AS2-AS3-AS1.  This violates the
   policy of AS2, since it forwards traffic from a peer to a non-
   customer neighbor.

                       Figure 6: Initial Setup Local

   Let us assume a second case where AS2 and AS3 are not peering and AS1

   only propagates the overlapping prefix to AS3.  AS4 receives the
   overlapping prefix only from its traffic provider, AS5.  This case is
   illustrated in Figure 6.

   Similar to the scenario described in Section 3.1.2, AS4 is in a
   situation in which it would be favorable to filter the announcement
   of prefix 10.0.0.0/24 from AS5.  Subsequently, traffic originating
   from AS4 to prefix 10.0.0.0/24 is forwarded to AS2.  Traffic
   originating in AS4 and heading for prefix 10.0.0.0/24 would follow
   the path AS4-AS2-AS5-AS3-AS1.  This path violates the policy of AS2,
   as this AS is forwarding traffic from a peer to a transit network.

3.2.  Violation caused by remotely triggered filtering

   We present a configuration scenario in which an AS, using the
   mechanism described in Section 2.2, informs its provider to
   selectively announce a covering prefix, leading to the violation of a
   policy of another AS.

3.2.1.  Initial setup

   Let AS_cust be a customer AS of AS A and AS B. It owns 10.0.0.0/22,
   which it advertises through AS A and AS B. Additionally, AS A and AS
   B are peers.

   Both AS A and AS B select their customer path as best, and propagate
   that path to their customers, providers, and peers.

   Some remote ASes will route traffic destined to 10.0.0.0 through (...
   A Cust 10.0.0.0/24) while some others will route traffic along (...
   B Cust 10.0.0.0/24).

                        Figure 7: Example scenario

3.2.2.  Injection of a more specific

   Let AS_cust advertise 10.0.0.0/24 over AS B only.  AS B propagates
   this prefix to its customers, provider and peers, including AS A.

   From AS A's point of view, such a path is a "peer path", so that this
   path will only be advertised to its customers.

   All ASes that are not in the customer branch of AS A will receive a
   path to the /24 that contains AS B, and not AS A, as AS A has not
   propagated the prefix to other ASes than its customers.

   The ASes that are in the customer branch of AS A will receive a path
   to the /24 that contains AS B and AS A, as AS A has propagated that
   path to its customers.  Some multi-homed customers of ISP A may also
   receive a path through ISP B, but not through ISP A, from other
   peering or provider links.

                     Figure 8: More Specific Injection

   Any remote AS that is not lying in the customer branch of A, will
   receive a path for 10.0.0.0/24 through AS B and not through AS A.

   Routing is consistent with usual Internet Routing Policies here, as
   AS A may only receive traffic destined to 10.0.0.0/24 from its
   customers, which it forwards to its peer AS B. AS B may receive
   traffic destined to 10.0.0.0/24 from its customers, providers, and
   peers, which it directly forwards to its customer AS Cust.

3.2.3.  Limiting the scope of the more specific

   Now, let us assume that 10.0.0.0/24, which is propagated by AS_Cust
   to AS B, is tagged so as to have AS B only propagate that path to AS
   A, using the techniques described in Section 2.2.

   From AS A's point of view, such a path is a "peer path", so that this
   path will only be advertised by AS A to its customers.

   All the ASes that are not in the customer branch of AS A nor in the
   customer branch of AS B will NOT receive a path to 10.0.0.0/24.

   All these ASes will forward packets destined to 10.0.0.0/24 according
   to their routing state for 10.0.0.0/22.

   Let us assume that AS_Src is such an AS, and that its best path
   towards 10.0.0.0/22 is through AS A. In that case, packets sent
   towards 10.0.0.1 by AS_Src will eventually reach AS A. However, in
   the dataplane of the nodes of AS A, the longest prefix match for
   10.0.0.0 is 10.0.0.0/24, which is reached through AS B, a peer of AS
   A.

   As AS_Src is by definition not in the customer branch of AS A, we are
   in a situation such that AS A is forwarding non customer originated

   traffic along peering links, which violates its policies.

   If the path towards 10.0.0.0/24 is propagated by B to its customers,
   the traffic originated by ASes in the customer branch of AS A will
   not follow policy-violating data-plane paths as the forwarding of
   traffic towards these destinations will always be based on FIB
   entries for 10.0.0.0/24.  However, policy-violation can still take
   place for the traffic originated from all ASes that are neither in
   the customer branch of A nor in the customer branch of B.


4.  Techniques to detect dataplane-based policy violations

   We differentiate the techniques available for detecting policy
   violations from the cases in which the interested AS is the victim or
   contributor of such operations.

4.1.  Being the victim of the policy violation

   To detect that its policies have been violated, one ISP can monitor
   its NetFlow data so as to see if flows entering the ISP network
   through a non-customer link is being forwarded to a non-customer
   nexthop.

   Detecting such a violation can be done by looking at BGP data to see
   whether there exists in the RIB a prefix P/p' more specific than P/p
   such that the nexthop for P/p' is through a peer (or a provider)
   while P/p is routed through a customer.  For each such couple of
   prefixes, direct communication or looking glasses can be used in
   order to check whether non-customer neighboring ASes are propagating
   a path towards P/p (and not towards P/p') to their own customers,
   peers, or providers.  This should trigger a warning as this would
   mean that ASes in the surrounding area of the current AS are
   forwarding packets based on the routing entry for the less specific
   prefix only.

4.2.  Being a contributor to the policy violation

   It can be considered as problematic to be a contributor of the policy
   violation as it appears as an abuse of other's network resources.

   There may be justifiable reasons for one ISP to perform filtering,
   either to enforce establishing policies or to provide prefix
   advertisement scoping features to its customers.  These can vary from
   trouble-shooting purposes to business relationships implementations.
   Restricting such features for the sake of avoiding contributing to
   potential policy violations in a peer's network is a bad option.

   Netflow data does not help an ISP to detect that it is acting as a
   contributor of the policy violation.  It is thus advisable to obtain
   as much information as possible of the Internet environment of the AS
   and assessing the risks of filtering of overlapping prefixes before
   implementing them.

   Monitoring the manipulation of the communities that implement the
   scoping of prefixes in one's network is recommended to the ISPs which
   provide these features.  The monitored behavior should then be faced
   against their terms of use.


5.  Techniques to counter policy violations

   Network Operators can adopt different approaches with respect to
   policy violation.  We classify these actions according to whether
   they are anticipant or reactive.

   Reactive approaches are those in which the operator tries to detect
   the situations and solves the policy violation through other means
   than using the routing system.

   Anticipant or preventive approaches are those in which the routing
   system will not let the policy violation actually take place when the
   configuration scenario is set up.

5.1.  Reactive counter-measures

   An operator who detects that its policies have been violated can
   contact the ASes that are likely to have performed the propagation
   tweaks so as to have them change their behavior.

   An operator can account the amount of traffic that has been subject
   to policy violation, and charge the peer that received the policy-
   violating traffic.  That is, the operator can claim that it has been
   a provider of that peer for that part of the traffic that transited
   between the two ASes.

   An operator can decide to filter-out the concerned more specific
   prefix at the peering session over which it was received.  In the
   example of Figure 9, AS A would filter out 10.0.0.0/24 in its eBGP
   in-filter associated with the eBGP session with AS B. As a result,
   the traffic destined to that /24 would be forwarded by AS A along its
   link with AS_Cust, despite the actions performed by AS_Cust to have
   this traffic coming in through it link with AS B.

5.2.  Anticipant counter-measures

5.2.1.  Neighbor-specific forwarding

   An operator can technically ensure that the traffic destined to a
   given prefix will be forwarded from an entry point of its AS, only on
   the basis of the set of paths that have been advertised over that
   entry point.

5.2.2.  Access lists

   An operator can configure its routers so as to have them dynamically
   install an access-list made of the prefixes towards which the
   forwarding of traffic from that interface would lead to a policy
   violation.  Note that this technique actually lets packets destined
   to a valid prefix be dropped while they are sent from a neighboring
   AS that cannot know about the policy violation and hence had no means
   to avoid the policy violation.

   In the example of Figure 9, AS A would install an access-list denying
   packets matching 10.0.0.0/24 associated with the interface connecting
   AS_Src. As a result, the traffic destined to that /24 would be
   dropped, despite the existence of a non policy-violating route
   towards 10.0.0.0/22.

5.2.3.  Automatic filtering

   As described in Section 3, filtering of overlapping prefixes can in
   some scenarios lead to policy violations.  Nevertheless, depending on
   the autonomous system implementing such practice, this operation can
   in fact prevent these cases.  This can be illustrated using the
   example described in Section 3.1.3: In Figure 6, if AS2 or AS3 filter
   prefix 10.0.0.0/24, there would be no policy violation for AS2.


6.  Conclusions

   In this document we described potential threats to policy violation
   of autonomous systems caused by the filtering of overlapping prefixes
   by external networks.  We provide examples of scenarios of policy
   violations caused by these practices and introduce some techniques
   for their detection and counter.  We observe that there are
   reasonable situations in which ASes could filter overlapping
   prefixes, however, we encourage that network operators implement this
   type of filters only after considering such threats.
