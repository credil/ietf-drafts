Abstract

   Mobile networks may be divided into two main segments: the radio
   segment, and the wireline segment. This document highlights that the
   algorithms leading to pre-congestion notification (e.g. ECN marking)
   are usually significantly different for these two segments, and not
   defined or documented in general over the radio segment. It also
   explains that using ECN bits leads to having a unique signal for
   notifying a pre-congestion related to two separate segments with
   very different notification algorithms. Some consequences are
   questioned, as well as the potential benefits of being able to
   identify where the congestion comes from. This document finally
   discusses the possibility to take into account the radio conditions
   of the terminals when counting the volume of congestion over the
   radio segment.

1. Introduction

   Mobile networks may be divided into two main segments, very unlike
   by nature: the radio segment, and the wireline segment. These two
   portions of a mobile network may experience QoS degradation due to
   excess traffic. Therefore, being able to notify about a so-called
   pre-congestion (e.g. using ECN marking) can be considered as a
   useful feature for these two segments.

   This document highlights that the algorithms leading to pre-
   congestion notification (e.g. ECN marking) are usually significantly
   different for these two segments. In particular, they are in general
   more complex on the radio segment, and not really defined or
   documented. Depending on the intended purpose, different algorithms
   might be designed over this segment and it is therefore important
   that they are understood and documented somewhere before being
   applied to a specific scenario.

   This document also reminds the typical IP layers in presence in
   mobile networks, e.g. due to the use of GTP tunnels. It highlights
   that the standardized ECN coding in the header of IP packets leads
   to having a unique signal for communicating to the receiver of the
   flows pre-congestion information potentially related to two separate
   segments with very different notification algorithms. The document
   suggests that the consequences of a common interpretation of this
   unique signal need to be assessed more in details and raises the
   question of potential benefits in being able to identify where the
   congestion comes from (e.g. using separated signals to inform about
   pre-congestion over these two segments).

   Finally, this document discusses the use of pre-congestion
   notification over the radio segment in some use cases related to the
   IETF ConEx WG, e.g. where the volume of congestion is counted. It
   advocates that counting the number of bytes transmitted over the
   radio segment during a pre-congestion period may not be the best
   approach to provide incentive to reduce network usage during these
   periods, because the terminals in bad radio conditions require more
   radio resources compared to the terminals in good radio conditions
   to reach the same rate. The possibility to take into account the
   radio conditions of the terminals when counting the volume of
   congestion over the radio segment is briefly introduced.

4. Pre-congestion notification in radio and wireline segments

   The two portions of a mobile network shown in figure 1 may
   experience QoS degradation due to excess traffic. Therefore, being
   able to notify about a pre-congestion (e.g. using ECN marking) can
   be considered as a useful feature for these two segments.

   It is important to stress that the algorithms leading to pre-
   congestion notification (e.g. ECN marking) are usually significantly

   different for these two segments. In particular, they are in general
   more complex on the radio segment, and not really defined or
   documented. Depending on the intended purpose, different algorithms
   might be designed over this segment and it is therefore important
   that they are understood and documented somewhere before being
   applied to a specific scenario.



4.1. Pre-congestion notification in wireline segment

   The algorithms for pre-congestion notification in an IP mobile
   wireline network are pretty well documented in IETF documents.
   Indeed, it is expected to correspond to classical ECN marking
   algorithms in IP routers.

   [RFC3168] (''The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
   to IP'') depicts the general ideas of ECN marking, which are based on
   Active Queue Management (AQM) and for example Random Early Detection
   (RED) principles (e.g. [RFC 2309], ''Recommendations on Queue
   Management and Congestion Avoidance in the Internet'').

   In particular, [RFC3168] mentions the following:

   o ''AQM drops packets based on the average queue length exceeding a
      threshold, rather than only when the queue overflows.''

   o ''AQM can set a Congestion Experienced (CE) codepoint in the
      packet header instead of dropping the packet, when such a field
      is provided in the IP header and understood by the transport
      protocol.''

   o ''For a router, the CE codepoint of an ECN-Capable packet SHOULD
      only be set if the router would otherwise have dropped the packet
      as an indication of congestion to the end nodes.''

   o ''We expect that routers will set the CE codepoint in response to
      incipient congestion as indicated by the average queue size,
      using the RED algorithms suggested in [FJ93, RFC2309]. To the
      best of our knowledge, this is the only proposal currently under
      discussion in the IETF for routers to drop packets proactively,
      before the buffer overflows. However, this document does not
      attempt to specify a particular mechanism for active queue
      management, leaving that endeavor, if needed, to other areas of
      the IETF.''

                           in mobile networks


   These mechanisms aim mainly at interacting with TCP, in order to
   reduce the bandwidth consumption when pre-congestion is detected.


4.2. Pre-congestion notification in radio segment

   The algorithms for pre-congestion notification in the radio segment
   of a mobile network are however expected to be significantly
   different from the wireline segment and more complex in general.

   Indeed, in the radio segment, a limited number of radio resources
   are available for all User Equipment (UE) of a cell. Every TTI
   (Transmission Time Interval), radio resources are dynamically
   allocated by the radio scheduler to the active UEs of the cell.

   In addition to the radio resources allocation, the quality of the
   radio channel of a given UE is a key parameter determining the
   achievable throughput for this UE: indeed, more complex and
   efficient radio Modulation and Coding Schemes (MCS) can be used when
   the UE is in very good radio conditions, leading to a higher
   throughput per radio resource. On the contrary, for the same amount
   of radio resources allocated, a UE in poor radio reception
   conditions requires more robust and simpler MCS and will experience
   lower bit rates than the same UE in good radio conditions. Hence, a
   UE in poor radio conditions will need much more radio resources to
   reach the same throughput compared to a UE in good radio conditions.

   The radio conditions are measured over the downlink channel by the
   UE and are reported to the mobile network, by means of Channel
   Quality Indicator (CQI) values.

   An algorithm aiming at notifying pre-congestion in the radio segment
   is therefore expected to take into account different parameters, as
   for instance:

   o Average queue length exceeding a threshold, as for RED

   o Amount of radio resources used by a particular UE and/or by all
      the active UEs of the cell

   o Radio conditions of a particular UE

                           in mobile networks


   The details of the algorithm for ECN bits marking in the radio
   segment, when supported, can however be considered as mainly
   proprietary at the moment, and is not known in general by the
   network operator.

   On this aspect, [5] (draft ''Mobile Communication Congestion Exposure
   Scenario'') presented in the IETF ConEx WG mentions the following:

   o ''ECN is already partially introduced into 3GPP networks: Section
      11.6 in [3GPP.36.300] specifies the usage of ECN for congestion
      notification on the radio link (between eNB and UE), and
      [3GPP.26.114] specifies how this can be leveraged for voice codec
      adaptation.''

   However, when looking at these 3GPP documents, they give only
   general information about the expected behavior at the UE (e.g.
   codec rate reduction), but not about the details of the ECN marking
   mechanism by the NB. For instance, the section 11.6 of [3] (TS
   36.300) dealing with Explicit Congestion Notification is copied
   below:

   o ''The eNB and the UE support of the Explicit Congestion
      Notification (ECN) is specified in Section 5 of [35] (i.e., the
      normative part of [35] that applies to the end-to-end flow of IP
      packets), and below. This enables the eNB to control the initial
      codec rate selection and/or to trigger a codec rate reduction.
      Thereby the eNB can increase capacity (e.g., in terms of number
      of accepted VoIP calls), and improve coverage (e.g. for high bit
      rate video sessions).''

   o ''The eNB should set the Congestion Experienced (CE) codepoint
      ('11') in PDCP SDUs in the downlink direction to indicate
      downlink (radio) congestion if those PDCP SDUs have one of the
      two ECN-Capable Transport (ECT) codepoints set. The eNB should
      set the Congestion Experienced (CE) codepoint ('11') in PDCP SDUs
      in the uplink direction to indicate uplink (radio) congestion if
      those PDCP SDUs have one of the two ECN-Capable Transport (ECT)
      codepoints set.''

   Some algorithms for marking ECN bits in the radio segment can be
   found in the literature; they may take into account some of the
   parameters listed before. These algorithms may aim also at
   interacting with TCP, in order to improve either the overall
   capacity or the fairness between UEs, but other design choices are
   also possible.

                           in mobile networks


   Anyway, there is no well-identified default ECN marking algorithm
   for the radio segment, so, it can be assumed that an actual
   implementation will make certain design choices and favor certain
   criteria compared to others (e.g. capacity vs fairness).

   Those choices are not necessarily expected to meet the objectives of
   a congestion-volume counting approach like discussed in the IETF
   ConEx WG, especially when the exact algorithm is not known by the
   network operator. They might not be the most optimal choices either.



4.3. General remarks about pre-congestion notification in mobile
   networks

   It has been shown that the criteria considered for pre-congestion
   notification in the wireline segment and in the radio segment are
   significantly different.

   It has also been shown also that different algorithm designs are
   possible for the pre-congestion notification over the radio segment,
   and that the details are not necessarily known, which makes the
   mechanism difficult to be applied to specific scenarios.

   There might be benefits in particular in providing more details
   about pre-congestion notification in the radio segment, in order to
   better understand the scenario on which it is suitable.

   As it will be explained in the next section, there might be also
   benefits in being able to identify where the congestion happened
   (radio vs wireline segment), in order to potentially take different
   actions.



5. ECN bits in IP E2E layer: a single signal to carry pre-congestion
   notification related to two separate segments

   The figure 1 presented before reminds the typical IP layers in
   presence in mobile networks (IP E2E and IP TNL), e.g. due to the use
   of GTP tunnels.

   This figure highlights that the standardized ECN coding in the
   header of IP E2E layer packets leads to having a unique signal for
   communicating to the receiver of the flows pre-congestion
   information potentially related to two separate segments, with very

                           in mobile networks


   different notification algorithms. Hence, pre-congestion located in
   the radio segment cannot be distinguished from those of the wireline
   segment.

   As examples, the following cases may happen when pre-congestion
   occurs in the downstream direction (i.e. from the server to the UE).
   The behavior described in [RFC6040] ("Tunnelling of Explicit
   Congestion Notification") consisting in propagating a 'CE' marking
   at the output of the IP tunnel is assumed.

   o Pre-congestion happened in the radio segment only: the ECN bits
      of the IP E2E layer are expected to be marked to 'CE' by the NB
      as to notify the UE about this radio pre-congestion.

   o Pre-congestion happened in the wireline segment only: the ECN
      bits of the IP TNL layer are expected to be marked to 'CE' by an
      IP router in the wireline network. The NB is then expected to
      propagate this 'CE' marking to the ECN bits of the IP E2E layer
      as to notify the UE about this wireline pre-congestion.

   o Pre-congestion happened in the radio segment and in the wireline
      segment simultaneously: the ECN bits of the IP TNL layer are
      expected to be marked to 'CE' by an IP router in the wireline
      network. The ECN bits of the IP E2E layer are also expected to be
      marked to 'CE' by the NB as to notify the UE about this radio
      pre-congestion.

   These illustrative examples show that the UE may not know where the
   pre-congestion comes from when using the ECN bits of the IP E2E
   layer.

   One might argue that the UE is not interested in knowing the
   location of the pre-congestion, and that the ECN marking is an end-
   to-end mechanism. This is correct under the assumption that the ECN
   marking criteria are consistent over the entire network. In the
   examples of a mobile network provided before, it is not the case.

   Therefore, an ECN marking could be misinterpreted by the UE (e.g. as
   a wireline pre-congestion instead of a radio pre-congestion, or
   vice-versa), with potentially inappropriate actions. A wireline pre-
   congestion notification might also be ''erased'' by a radio pre-
   congestion notification.

   It is important to remind, as explained before, that the algorithms
   leading to ECN marking are significantly different for these two
   segments. The consequences of a common interpretation of this unique

Internet-Draft       Pre-congestion notification            March 2012
                           in mobile networks


   signal corresponding to the ECN marking in the IP E2E layer need
   therefore to be assessed more in details, and probably depends on
   the actions that are triggered (e.g. interaction with TCP,
   congestion-volume counting...).

   Based on this discussion, this document raises the question of
   potential benefits in being able to identify where the congestion
   comes from (e.g. using separated signals to inform about pre-
   congestion over these two segments).

   The main question is in particular to determine whether the ECN bits
   of the IP E2E layer correspond to the best signal for indicating a
   pre-congestion happening in the radio segment.

   Indeed, the actions to be taken when a pre-congestion occurred may
   depend on the location of the pre-congestion (ECN marking on the
   radio could lead to less strict actions compared to a backhaul
   congestion, depending on the details of the ECN marking algorithm
   over the radio segment). Moreover, although not the main purpose of
   the mechanism, it might be useful also for the network management to
   identify where the congestions are located.

   These arguments might be further developed in a future revision of
   this paper, together with potential proposals to define separate
   signals to indicate pre-congestion notification over these two
   different segments of a mobile network. This type of approach would
   be compared to the complexity of defining separate signals.



6. Options for congestion-volume counting over the radio segment

   The current proposal in the IETF ConEx WG for counting congestion-
   volume is as follows: ''the "congestion volume" is defined to be the
   total number of bytes marked as congested'' (see [6] - draft
   ''Congestion Exposure (ConEx) Concepts and Abstract Mechanism'').

   As it has been explained in the paragraph 4.2, the radio conditions
   of a UE are an important parameter which determines the amount of
   radio resources required to reach a given throughput. Indeed, a UE
   in poor radio conditions will need much more radio resources to
   reach the same throughput compared to a UE in good radio conditions.

   For this reason, when applying use cases related to ConEx where the
   volume of congestion is counted, it could be of interest to take
   into account the radio conditions of the UE.

                           in mobile networks


   For example, each byte marked as pre-congested may be weighted by a
   multiplicative factor depending on the UE radio conditions instead
   of simply counting the number of bytes transmitted over the radio
   segment during a pre-congestion period.

   N thresholds (e.g. corresponding to different ranges of CQI values
   reported by the UE) might for instance be defined to refine the way
   the data volume is counted during pre-congestion periods. For
   instance, if N=3:

   o Excellent radio conditions: the congestion-volume is counted with
      a factor F=1, i.e. the number of bytes transmitted over the radio
      segment during a congestion period is counted

   o Degraded radio conditions: the congestion-volume is weighted with
      a factor F=2, i.e. twice the number of bytes transmitted over the
      radio segment during a congestion period is counted

   o Bad radio conditions: the congestion-volume is weighted with a
      factor F=5, i.e. five times the number of bytes transmitted over
      the radio segment during a congestion period is counted

   Another alternative would be that the pre-congestion notification
   probability (e.g. ECN marking probability) would take into account
   the radio conditions of the UE. Basically, the packets of a UE in
   bad radio conditions would be marked more often under pre-congestion
   periods than those of a UE in good radio conditions. This would
   provide an equivalent mechanism as the multiplicative factor
   described above.

   This type of mechanism would provide incentive to end users in bad
   radio conditions to delay their non-urgent network consumptions. Of
   course, the count would be only active when the cell is considered
   as in pre-congestion (according to criteria to be further defined).

   This proposal might be further developed in a future revision of
   this paper.



7. Conclusions

   This document has reminded that mobile networks may be divided into
   two main segments, very different by nature: the radio segment, and
   the wireline segment. It also highlighted that the algorithms
   leading to pre-congestion notification (e.g. ECN marking) are

   usually significantly different for these two segments, and not
   defined or documented in general over the radio segment. It also
   explained that using ECN bits leads to having a unique signal for
   notifying a pre-congestion related to two separate segments with
   very different notification algorithms. Some consequences of a
   common interpretation of this unique signal have been questioned, as
   well as the potential benefits in being able of identifying where
   the congestion comes. This document finally discussed the
   possibility to take into account the radio conditions of the
   terminals when counting the volume of congestion over the radio
   segment.

   This document proposes that:

   o The main families of algorithms leading to pre-congestion
      notification (e.g. ECN marking) in the radio segment would be
      documented somewhere. This might involve Standard Development
      Organisms beyond the IETF. It is however considered useful
      information for IETF work.

   o The signal indicating a pre-congestion over the radio segment
      would be discussed. The main question is in particular to
      determine whether the ECN bits of the IP E2E layer correspond to
      the best signal or if a separate signal should be defined.

   o For the use cases where congestion-volume are counted (as
      discussed in the IETF ConEx WG), the radio conditions of the UE
      are taken into account in the count, either via the introduction
      of a multiplicative factor or with a pre-congestion notification
      probability (e.g. ECN marking probability) taking into account
      the radio conditions.

   Some proposals contained in this document might be further developed
   in a future revision of this paper.
