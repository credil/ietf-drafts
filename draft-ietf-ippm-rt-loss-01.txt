                       draft-ietf-ippm-rt-loss-01

Abstract

   Many user applications (and the transport protocols that make them
   possible) require two-way communications.  To assess this capability,
   and to achieve test system simplicity, round-trip loss measurements
   are frequently conducted in practice.  The Two-Way Active Measurement
   Protocol specified in RFC 5357 establishes a round-trip loss
   measurement capability for the Internet.  However, there is currently
   no metric specified according to the RFC 2330 framework.

   This memo adds round-trip loss to the set of IP Performance Metrics
   (IPPM).

Internet-Draft               Round-trip Loss                   July 2011


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a metric for round-trip loss on Internet paths.  It
   builds on the notions and conventions introduced in the IP
   Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework [RFC2330].  Also, the
   specifications of the One-way Loss metric [RFC2680] and the Round-
   trip Delay metric [RFC2681] are frequently referenced and modified to
   match the round-trip circumstances addressed here.  However, this
   memo assumes that the reader is familiar with the references, and
   does not repeat material as was done in [RFC2681].

   This memo uses the terms "two-way" and "round-trip" synonymously.

1.1.  Motivation

   Many user applications and the transport protocols that make them
   possible require two-way communications.  For example, the TCP SYN->,
   <-SYN-ACK, ACK-> three-way handshake attempted billions of times each
   day cannot be completed without two-way connectivity in a near-
   simultaneous time interval.  Thus, measurements of Internet round-
   trip loss performance provide a basis to infer application
   performance more easily.

   Measurement system designers have also recognized advantages of
   system simplicity when one host simply echoes or reflects test
   packets to the sender.  Round-trip loss measurements are frequently
   conducted and reported in practice.  The Two-Way Active Measurement
   Protocol (TWAMP) specified in [RFC5357] establishes a round-trip loss
   measurement capability for the Internet.  However, there is currently
   no round-trip loss metric specified according to the [RFC2330]
   framework.

   [RFC2681] indicates that round-trip measurements may sometimes
   encounter "asymmetric" paths.  When loss is observed using a round-
   trip measurement, there is often a desire to ascertain which of the
   two directional paths "lost" the packet.  Under some circumstances,
   it is possible to make this inference.  The round-trip measurement
   method raises a few complications when interpreting the embedded one-
   way results, and the user should be aware of them.

   [RFC2681] also points out that loss measurement conducted
   sequentially in both directions of a path and reported as a round-
   trip result may be exactly the desired metric.  On the other hand, it
   may be difficult to derive the state of round-trip loss from one-way
   measurements conducted in each direction unless a method to match the
   appropriate one-way measurements has been pre-arranged.

   Finally, many measurement systems report statistics on a conditional

Internet-Draft               Round-trip Loss                   July 2011


   delay distribution, where the condition is packet arrival at the
   destination.  This condition is encouraged in [RFC3393], [RFC5481],
   and [draft-ietf-ippm-reporting-metrics].  As a result, lost packets
   need to be reported separately, according to a standardized metric.
   This memo defines such a metric.

   See Section 1.1 of[RFC2680] for additional motivation of the packet
   loss metric.


2.  Scope

   This memo defines a round-trip loss metric using the conventions of
   the IPPM framework [RFC2330].

   The memo defines a singleton metric, a sample metric, and a
   statistic, as per [RFC2330].

   The memo also investigates the topic of one-way loss inference from a
   two-way measurement, and lists some key considerations.


3.  Common Specifications for Round-trip Metrics

   To reduce the redundant information presented in the detailed metrics
   sections that follow, this section presents the specifications that
   are common to two or more metrics.  The section is organized using
   the same subsections as the individual metrics, to simplify
   comparisons.

3.1.  Name: Type-P-*

   All metrics use the Type-P convention as described in [RFC2330].  The
   rest of the name is unique to each metric.

3.2.  Metric Parameters

   o  Src, the IP address of a host

   o  Dst, the IP address of a host

   o  T, a time (start of test interval)

   o  Tf, a time (end of test interval)

   o  lambda, a rate in reciprocal seconds (for Poisson Streams)

Internet-Draft               Round-trip Loss                   July 2011


   o  incT, the nominal duration of inter-packet interval, first bit to
      first bit (for Periodic Streams)

   o  T0, a time that MUST be selected at random from the interval [T,
      T+dT] to start generating packets and taking measurements (for
      Periodic Streams)

   o  TstampSrc, the wire time of the packet as measured at MP(Src) as
      it leaves for Dst.

   o  TstampDst, the wire time of the packet as measured at MP(Dst),
      assigned to packets that arrive within a "reasonable" time.

   o  Tmax, a maximum waiting time for packets to arrive, set
      sufficiently long to disambiguate packets with long delays from
      packets that are discarded (lost).

   o  M, the total number of packets sent between T0 and Tf

   o  N, the total number of packets received at Dst (sent between T0
      and Tf)

   o  Type-P, as defined in [RFC2330], which includes any field that may
      affect a packet's treatment as it traverses the network

3.3.  Metric Definition

   This section is specific to each metric.

3.4.  Metric Units

   The metric units are logical (1 or 0) when describing a single
   packet's loss performance, where a 0 indicates successful packet
   transmission and a 1 indicates packet loss.

   Units of time are as specified in [RFC2330].

   Other units used are defined in the associated section.


4.  A Singleton Round-trip Loss Metric

4.1.  Name: Type-P-Round-trip-Loss

Internet-Draft               Round-trip Loss                   July 2011


4.2.  Metric Parameters

   See section 3.2.

4.3.  Definition and Metric Units

   Type-P-Round-trip-Loss SHALL be represented by the binary logical
   values (or their equivalents) when the following conditions are met:

   Type-P-Round-trip-Loss = 0:

   o  Src sent the first bit of a Type-P packet to Dst at wire-time
      TstampSrc,

   o  that Dst received that packet,

   o  the Dst sent a Type-P packet back to the Src as immediately as
      possible, and

   o  that Src received the last bit of the reflected packet prior to
      wire-time TstampSrc + Tmax.

   Type-P-Round-trip-Loss = 1:

   o  Src sent the first bit of a Type-P packet to Dst at wire-time
      TstampSrc,

   o  that Src did not receive the last bit of the reflected packet
      before the waiting time lapsed at TstampSrc + Tmax.

   Possible causes for the Loss = 1 outcome are:

   o  the Dst did not receive that packet,

   o  the Dst did not send a Type-P packet back to the Src, or

   o  the Src did not receive a reflected Type-P packet sent from the
      Dst.

   Following the precedent of[RFC2681], we make the simplifying
   assertion:

   Type-P-Round-trip-Loss(Src->Dst) = Type-P-Round-trip-Loss(Dst->Src)

   (and agree with the rationale presented there, that the ambiguity
   introduced is a small price to pay for measurement efficiency).

   Therefore, each singleton can be represented by pairs of elements as

Internet-Draft               Round-trip Loss                   July 2011


   follows:

   o  TstampSrc, the wire time of the packet at the Src (beginning the
      round-trip journey).

   o  L, either zero or one (or some logical equivalent), where L=1
      indicates loss and L=0 indicates successful round-trip arrival
      prior to TstampSrc + Tmax.

4.4.  Discussion and other details

   See [RFC2680] and [RFC2681] for extensive discussion, methods of
   measurement, errors and uncertainties, and other fundamental
   considerations that need not be repeated here.


5.  A Sample Round-trip Loss Metric

   Given the singleton metric Type-P-Round-trip-Loss, we now define one
   particular sample of such singletons.  The idea of the sample is to
   select a particular binding of the parameters Src, Dst, and Type-P,
   then define a sample of values of parameter TstampSrc.  This can be
   done in several ways, including:

   1.  Poisson: a pseudo-random Poisson process of rate lambda, whose
       values fall between T and Tf.  The time interval between
       successive values of TstampSrc will then average 1/lambda, as per
       [RFC2330].

   2.  Periodic: a periodic stream process with pseudo-random start time
       T0 between T and dT, and nominal inter-packet interval incT, as
       per [RFC3432].

   In the metric name, the variable <Stream> SHALL be replaced with the
   process used to define the sample, using one of the above processes
   (or other process, the details of which MUST be specified if used).

5.1.  Name: Type-P-Round-trip-Loss-<Sample>-Stream

5.2.  Metric Parameters

   See section 3.2.

5.3.  Definition and Metric Units

   Given one of the methods for defining the test interval, the sample
   of times (TstampSrc) and other metric parameters, we obtain a
   sequence of Type-P-Round-trip-Loss singletons as defined in section



Morton                   Expires January 9, 2012                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               Round-trip Loss                   July 2011


   4.3.

   Type-P-Round-trip-Loss-<Sample>-Stream SHALL be a sequence of pairs
   with elements as follows:

   o  TstampSrc, as above

   o  L, either zero or one (or some logical equivalent), where L=1
      indicates loss and L=0 indicates successful round-trip arrival
      prior to TstampSrc + Tmax.

   where <Sample> SHALL be replaced with "Poisson", "Periodic", or an
   appropriate term to designate another sample method meeting the
   criteria of [RFC2330].

5.4.  Discussion and other details

   See [RFC2680] and [RFC2681] for extensive discussion, methods of
   measurement, errors and uncertainties, and other fundamental
   considerations that need not be repeated here.  However, when these
   references were approved, the packet reordering metrics in [RFC4737]
   had not yet been defined, nor had reordering been addressed in IPPM
   methodologies.

   [RFC4737] defines packets that arrive "late" with respect to their
   sending order as reordered.  For example, when packets arrive with
   sequence numbers 4, 7, 5, 6, then packets 5 and 6 are reordered, and
   they are obviously not lost because they have arrived within some
   reasonable waiting time threshold.  The presence of reordering on a
   round-trip path has several likely affects on the measurement.

   1.  Methods of measurement should continue to wait the specified time
       for packets, and avoid prematurely declaring round-trip loss when
       a sequence gap or error is observed.

   2.  The time distribution of the singletons in the sample has been
       significantly changed.

   3.  Either the original packet stream or the reflected packet stream
       experienced path instability, and the original conditions may no
       longer be present.

   Measurement implementations MUST address the possibility for packet
   reordering and avoid related errors in their processes.

6.  Round-trip Loss Statistic

   This section gives the primary and overall statistic for loss
   performance.  Additional statistics and metrics originally prepared
   for One-way loss MAY also be applicable.

6.1.  Type-P-Round-trip-Loss-<Sample>-Ratio

   Given a Type-P-Round-trip-Loss-<Sample>-Stream, the average of all
   the logical values, L, in the Stream is the Type-P-Round-trip-Loss-
   <Sample>-Ratio.  This ratio is in units of lost packets per round-
   trip transmissions actually attempted.

   In addition, the Type-P-Round-trip-Loss-<Sample>-Ratio is undefined
   if the sample is empty.


7.  Round-trip Testing and One-way Reporting

   This section raises considerations for results collected using a
   round-trip measurement architecture, such as in TWAMP [RFC5357].

   The sampling process for the reverse path (Dst->Src) is a conditional
   process that depends on successful packet arrival at the Dst and
   correct operation at the Dst to generate the reflected packet.
   Therefore, the sampling process for the reverse path will be
   significantly affected when appreciable loss occurs on the Src->Dst
   path, making an attempt to assess the reverse path performance
   invalid (for loss or possibly any metric).

   Further, the sampling times for the reverse path (Dst->Src) are a
   random process that depends on the original sample times (TstampSrc),
   the one-way-delay for successful packet arrival at the Dst, and time
   taken at the Dst to generate the reflected packet.  Therefore, the
   sampling process for the reverse path will be significantly affected
   when appreciable delay variation occurs on the Src->Dst path, making
   an attempt to assess the reverse path performance invalid (for loss
   or possibly any metric).

   As discussed above, packet reordering is always a possibility.  In
   addition to the severe delay variation that usually accompanies it,
   reordering on the Src->Dst path will cause a mis-alignment of
   sequence numbers applied at the reflector when compared to the sender
   numbers.  Measurement implementations SHOULD address this possible
   outcome.

8.  Measurement Considerations and Calibration

   Prior to conducting this measurement, the participating hosts MUST be
   configured to send and receive test packets of the chosen Type-P.
   Standard measurement protocols are capable of this task [RFC5357],
   but any reliable method is sufficient.

   Two key features of the host that receives test packets and returns
   them to the originating host is described in section 4.2 of [RFC5357]
   .  Every received test packet MUST result in a responding packet, and
   the response MUST be generated as immediately as possible.  This
   implies that interface buffers will be serviced promptly, and that
   buffer discards will be extremely rare.  These features of the
   measurement equipment MUST be calibrated according to Section 3.7.3
   of [RFC2679], when operating under a representative measurement load
   (as defined by the user).  Both unexpected test packet discards and
   the systematic and random errors and uncertainties MUST be recorded.

   We note that Section 4.2.1 of [RFC5357] specifies a method to collect
   all four significant time-stamps needed to describe a packet's round-
   trip delay [RFC2681] and remove the processing time incurred at the
   responding host.  This information supports the measurement of the
   corresponding One-way Delays encountered on the round-trip path,
   which can identify path asymmetry or unexpected processing time at
   the responding host.


9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Denial of Service Attacks

   This metric requires a stream of packets sent from one host (source)
   to another host (destination) through intervening networks, and back.
   This method could be abused for denial of service attacks directed at
   the destination and/or the intervening network(s).

   Administrators of source, destination, and the intervening network(s)
   should establish bilateral or multi-lateral agreements regarding the
   timing, size, and frequency of collection of sample metrics.  Use of
   this method in excess of the terms agreed between the participants
   may be cause for immediate rejection or discard of packets or other
   escalation procedures defined between the affected parties.

9.2.  User Data Confidentiality

   Active use of this method generates packets for a sample, rather than
   taking samples based on user data, and does not threaten user data
   confidentiality.  Passive measurement must restrict attention to the



Morton                   Expires January 9, 2012               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft               Round-trip Loss                   July 2011


   headers of interest.  Since user payloads may be temporarily stored
   for length analysis, suitable precautions MUST be taken to keep this
   information safe and confidential.  In most cases, a hashing function
   will produce a value suitable for payload comparisons.

9.3.  Interference with the metrics

   It may be possible to identify that a certain packet or stream of
   packets is part of a sample.  With that knowledge at the destination
   and/or the intervening networks, it is possible to change the
   processing of the packets (e.g. increasing or decreasing delay) that
   may distort the measured performance.  It may also be possible to
   generate additional packets that appear to be part of the sample
   metric.  These additional packets are likely to perturb the results
   of the sample measurement.

   To discourage the kind of interference mentioned above, packet
   interference checks, such as cryptographic hash, may be used.


10.  IANA Considerations

   Metrics defined in IETF are typically registered in the IANA IPPM
   METRICS REGISTRY as described in initial version of the registry
   [RFC4148].  However, areas for improvement of this registry have been
   identified, and the registry structure has to be revisited when there
   is consensus to do so.

   Therefore, the metrics in this draft may be considered for
   registration in the future, and no IANA Action is requested at this
   time.
