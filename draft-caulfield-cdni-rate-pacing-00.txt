1.  Introduction

   Rate pacing is a class of network traffic shaping which limits the
   transmission rate of data over a network.  In the context of a
   Content Delivery Network (CDN), rate pacing provides an important
   business advantage to a Content Service Provider (CSP) by ensuring
   that a CDN which is delivering content on behalf of that CSP does not
   deliver significantly more data than necessary to an end client.

   For example, suppose an end client is watching some Constant Bit Rate
   (CBR) video encoded at 1500 kbps.  In the absence of rate pacing, the
   CDN delivering this content may send it to the client at 3000 kbps.
   If the client chooses to terminate the session before watching the
   entire video, up to half the transmitted data is wasted.  This waste
   leads to unnecessary cost for the CSP and diminished useful capacity
   for the CDN.

   Rate pacing requires configuration on a per-content basis.  In order
   to enable rate pacing in a CDNI environment, the CDNI interfaces need
   to be extended to optionally support this feature.

   This document describes:

   1.  a rate pacing algorithm for CDNs

   2.  CDNI interface extensions required for supporting rate pacing

2.  Rate Pacing Algorithm

   A token bucket algorithm SHOULD be used for implementing rate pacing.
   Other algorithms MAY be used but the traffic shape MUST fit within
   the same envelope of a token bucket algorithm.  Token bucket is
   described by [RFC1363].

   The token bucket algorithm is characterized by two parameters:

   1.  Rate - the number of tokens added to the bucket per second

   2.  Size - the maximum number of tokens in the bucket

   For the purpose of this document, each token represents one byte.

3.  CDNI Interfaces Impact

3.1.  Footprint & Capabilities Interface

   [I-D.ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics]defines the CDNI
   Footprint and Capabilities semantics.  But at the time of writing, no
   FCI syntax specification has been accepted as a working group
   document.

   [I-D.ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics]states that:

   "The CDNI FCI specification SHOULD define the registry (and the rules
   for adding new entries to the registry) for the different capability
   types.  Each capability type MAY further have a list of valid values.
   The individual CDNI interface specifications which define a given
   capability SHOULD define any necessary registries (and the rules for
   adding new entries to the registry) for the values advertised for a
   given capability type."

   This document defines a new capability type: "RatePacing" to be added
   to the FCI capability types registry.  No value needs to be
   advertised for this capability and therefore no additional value
   registry need to be defined.

   A CDN MAY advertise the "RatePacing" capability in the FCI if it
   implements this specification.

3.2.  Request Routing Redirection Interface

   A new RatePacing metadata object is defined to represent the
   configuration for rate pacing.  The RatePacing object has MIME type

   "application/cdni.RatePacing".  RatingPacing MAY appear within the
   metadata list of either HostMetadata or PathMetadata (i.e. may have
   either host-level scope or a path-level scope).  The following
   section defines the properties of the RatingPacing object.

3.3.  Metadata Interface

   A new RatePacing metadata object is defined to represent the
   configuration for rate pacing.  The RatePacing object has MIME type
   "application/cdni.RatePacing".  RatingPacing MAY appear within the
   metadata list of either HostMetadata or PathMetadata (i.e. may have
   either host-level scope or a path-level scope).  The following
   section defines the properties of the RatingPacing object.

3.3.1.  RatePacing Metadata

   The presence of the RatePacing Metadata indicates that a dCDN MUST
   comply with the Rate Pacing Algorithm defined by this specification
   in order to deliver a piece of content.

      Property: rate

         Description: Rate of tokens per second to be added to the
         bucket as described by the token bucket algorithm.  This value
         MUST be a positive integer.  Each token represents one byte.

         Type: Integer

         Mandatory-to-Specify: Yes.

      Property: size

         Description: Maximum number of tokens per bucket as described
         by the token bucket algorithm.  This value MUST be a positive
         integer.

         Type: Integer

         Mandatory-to-Specify: Yes.

3.4.  Logging Interface

   The rate at which a piece of content was delivered MAY be indicated
   via the LI.  The "sc-rate" field indicates the rate in bytes per
   second as a decimal number.  The bytes measured should correspond to
   the sc-entity-bytes field.

      sc-rate:

Internet-Draft              CDNI Rate Pacing                October 2013


         format: DEC

         field value: the average rate in bytes per second at which a
         response was delivered from Surrogate to client.

         occurence: there MUST be zero or exactly one instances of this
         field.

3.5.  Control Interface

   The CI is not impacted by rate pacing.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the following of IANA:

   Addition of RatePacing in the CDNI Capability Registry defined in
   ???.

   Addition of RatePacing in the CDNI GenericMetadata Type Registry
   defined in [I-D.ietf-cdni-metadata].

   Addition of sc-rate in the CDNI Logging Field Names Registry defined
   in [I-D.ietf-cdni-logging].

5.  Security Considerations

   A malicious CSP might attempt to use rate pacing to instruct a dCDN
   to delivery some content at a very high rate thereby amplifying a
   DDOS attack.  The decision to enforce a rate is left to the
   discretion of a dCDN.  An implementation of rate pacing should
   implement reasonable upper bound to avoid such cases.
