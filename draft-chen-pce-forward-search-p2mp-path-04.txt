Internet-Draft          Forward Search P2MP Path          September 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4105] "Requirements for Inter-Area MPLS TE" lists the
   requirements for computing a shortest path for a TE LSP crossing
   multiple IGP areas; and [RFC4216] "MPLS Inter-Autonomous System (AS)
   TE Requirements" describes the requirements for computing a shortest
   path for a TE LSP crossing multiple ASes.  [RFC5671] "Applicability
   of PCE to P2MP MPLS and GMPLS TE" examines the applicability of PCE
   to path computation for P2MP TE LSPs in MPLS and GMPLS networks.

   This document presents a forward search procedure to address these
   requirements for computing a path for a P2MP TE LSP crossing domains
   through using multiple Path Computation Elements (PCEs).

   The procedure is called "Forward Search Shortest P2MP LSP Path
   Crossing Domains".  The major characteristics of this procedure for
   computing a path for a P2MP TE LSP from a source node to a number of
   destination nodes crossing multiple domains include the following
   three ones.

   1.  It guarantees that the path computed from the source node to the
       destination nodes is shortest.

   2.  It does not depend on any domain path tree or domain sequences
       from the source node to the destination nodes.

   3.  Navigating a mesh of domains is simple and efficient.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   ABR:  Area Border Router.  Router used to connect two IGP areas
      (Areas in OSPF or levels in IS-IS).

   ASBR:  Autonomous System Border Router.  Router used to connect
      together ASes of the same or different service providers via one
      or more inter-AS links.

   BN (Boundary Node):  a BN is either an ABR in the context of inter-
      area Traffic Engineering or an ASBR in the context of inter-AS
      Traffic Engineering.

   Entry BN of domain(n):  a BN connecting domain(n-1) to domain(n)
      along the path found from the source node to the BN, where
      domain(n-1) is the previous hop domain of domain(n).

   Exit BN of domain(n):  a BN connecting domain(n) to domain(n+1) along
      the path found from the source node to the BN, where domain(n+1)

      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

4.  Requirements

   This section summarizes the requirements specific for computing a
   path for a Traffic Engineering (TE) LSP crossing multiple domains
   (areas or ASes).  More requirements for Inter-Area and Inter-AS MPLS
   Traffic Engineering are described in [RFC4105] and [RFC4216].

   A number of requirements specific for a solution to compute a path
   for a TE LSP crossing multiple domains is listed as follows:

   1.  The solution SHOULD provide the capability to compute a shortest
       path dynamically, satisfying a set of specified constraints
       across multiple IGP areas.

   2.  The solution MUST provide the ability to reoptimize in a
       minimally disruptive manner (make before break) an inter-area TE

       LSP, should a more optimal path appear in any traversed IGP area.

   3.  The solution SHOULD provide mechanism(s) to compute a shortest
       end-to-end path for a TE LSP crossing multiple ASes and
       satisfying a set of specified constraints dynamically.

   4.  Once an inter-AS TE LSP has been established, and should there be
       any resource or other changes inside anyone of the ASes, the
       solution MUST be able to re-optimize the LSP accordingly and non-
       disruptively, either upon expiration of a configurable timer or
       upon being triggered by a network event or a manual request at
       the TE tunnel Head-End.

5.  Forward Search P2MP Path Computation

   This section gives an overview of the forward search path computation
   procedure to satisfy the requirements for computing a path for a P2MP
   TE LSP crossing multiple domains described above and describes the
   procedure in details.

5.1.  Overview of Procedure

   Simply speaking, the idea of the Forward Search P2MP inter-domain
   path computation method for computing a path for an MPLS TE P2MP LSP
   crossing multiple domains from a source node to a number of
   destination nodes includes:

   Start from the source node and the source domain.

   Consider the optimal path segment from the source node to every exit
   boundary and destination node of the source domain as a special link;

   Consider the optimal path segment from an entry boundary node to
   every exit boundary node and destination node of a domain as a
   special link; and the optimal path segment is computed as needed.

   The whole topology consisting of many domains can be considered as a
   special virtual topology, which contains those special links and the
   inter-domain links.

   Compute a shortest path in this special topology from the source node
   to the multiple destination nodes using CSPF.

   Forward Search P2MP inter-domain path computation method running at
   any PCE just grows the result path list/tree in the same way as
   normal CSPF on the special virtual topology.  When the result path
   list/tree reaches all the destination nodes, the shortest path from
   the source node to the destination nodes is found and a PCRep message

Internet-Draft          Forward Search P2MP Path          September 2012


   with the path is sent to the PCE/PCC that sends the PCReq message
   eventually.

5.2.  Description of Procedure

   Suppose that we have the following variables:

   A current PCE named as CurrentPCE which is currently computing the
   path.

   A candidate node list named as CandidateNodeList, which contains the
   nodes to each of which the temporary optimal path from the source
   node is currently found and satisfies a set of given constraints.
   The information about each node C in CandidateNodeList consists of:

   o  the cost of the path from the source node to node C,

   o  the hopcount of the path from the source node to node C,

   o  the previous hop node P and the link between P and C,

   o  the domain list of C (ABR or ASBR) where C has visibility to
      multiple domains and clearly mark the domain by which C is added
      to CandidateNodeList,

   o  the PCE responsible for C (i.e., the PCE responsible for the
      domain containing C. Alternatively, we may use the above mentioned
      domain instead of the PCE.), and

   o  the flags for C. The flags include:

      *  bit D indicating that C is a Destination node if it is set,

      *  bit S indicating that C is the Source node if it is set,

      *  bit T indicating that C is on result path Tree if it is set.

   The nodes in CandidateNodeList are ordered by path cost.

   Initially, CandidateNodeList contains a Source Node, with path cost
   0, PCE responsible for the source domain, and flags with S bit set.
   It also contains every destination node, with path cost infinity and
   flags with D bit set.

   A result path list or tree named as ResultPathTree, which contains
   the shortest paths from the source node to the boundary nodes and
   destination nodes.  Initially, ResultPathTree is empty.

Internet-Draft          Forward Search P2MP Path          September 2012


   Alternatively, the result path list or tree can be combined into the
   candidate node list.  We may set bit T to one in the NODE-FLAGS
   object (refer [FORWARD-SEARCH-P2P-PATH]) for the candidate node when
   grafting it into the existing result path list or tree.  Thus all the
   candidate nodes with bit T set to one in the candidate list
   constitute the result path tree or list.

   The Forward Search path computation method for computing a path for
   an MPLS TE P2MP LSP crossing a number of domains from a source node
   to a number of destination nodes can be described as follows:

   Initially, a PCC sends a PCE responsible for the source domain a
   request with CandidateNodeList and ResultPathTree initialized.

   When the PCE responsible for a domain (called current domain)
   receives a request for computing the path for the MPLS TE P2MP LSP,
   it checks whether the current PCE is the PCE responsible for the node
   C with the minimum cost in the CandidateNodeList(always expand node C
   only if it is an entry boundary node).  If it is, then remove C from
   CandidateNodeList and graft it into ResultPathTree (i.e., set flag
   bit T of node C to one); otherwise, a PCReq message is sent to the
   PCE for node C.

   Suppose that node C is in the current domain.  The ResultPathTree is
   built from C in the following steps.

   If node C is a destination node (i.e., the Destination Node (D) bit
   in the Flags is set), then check whether the path cost to node C is
   infinity.  If it is, then we can not find any path for the P2MP LSP,
   and a reply message with failure reasons is sent; otherwise, if all
   the destinations are on the result path tree, then the shortest path
   is found and a PCRep message with the path is sent to the PCE/PCC
   which sends the request to the current PCE.

   If node C is an entry boundary node or the source node, then the
   optimal path segments from node C to every destination node and every
   exit boundary node of the current domain that is not on the result
   path tree and satisfies the given constraints are computed through
   using CSPF and as special links.

   For every node N connected to node C through a special link (i.e.,
   the optimal path segment satisfying the given constraints), it is
   merged into CandidateNodeList.  The cost to node N is the sum of the
   cost to node C and the cost of the special link (i.e., the path
   segment) between C and N. If node N is not in the candidate node
   list, then node N is added into the list with the cost to node N,
   node C as its previous hop node and a PCE for node N. The PCE for
   node N is the current PCE if node N is an ASBR; otherwise (node N is

Internet-Draft          Forward Search P2MP Path          September 2012


   an ABR, an exit boundary node of the current domain and an entry
   boundary node of the domain next to the current domain) the PCE for
   node N is the PCE for the next domain.  If node N is in the candidate
   node list and the cost to node N through node C is less than the cost
   to node N in the list, then replace the cost to node N in the list
   with the cost to node N through node C and the previous hop to node N
   in the list with node C.

   If node C is an exit boundary node and there are inter-domain links
   connecting to it (i.e., node C is an ASBR) and satisfying the
   constraints, then for every node N connecting to C, satisfying the
   constraints and not on the result path tree, it is merged into the
   candidate node list.  The cost to node N is the sum of the cost to
   node C and the cost of the link between C and N. If node N is not in
   the candidate node list, then node N is added into the list with the
   cost to node N, node C as its previous hop node and the PCE for node
   N. If node N is in the candidate node list and the cost to node N
   through node C is less than the cost to node N in the list, then
   replace the cost to node N in the list with the cost to node N
   through node C and the previous hop to node N in the list with node
   C.

   If the CurrentPCE is the same as the PCE for the node D with the
   minimum cost in CandidateNodeList, then the node D is removed from
   CandidateNodeList and grafted to ResultPathTree (i.e., set flag bit T
   of node D to one), and the above steps are repeated; otherwise, a
   request message is to be sent to the PCE for node D.

   Note that if node C has visibility to multiple domains, do not remove
   it from the CandidateNodeList until it is expanded in all domains.
   Also mark in the domain list of node C, for which domains it is
   already expanded.

5.3.  Processing Request and Reply Messages

   In this section, we describe the processing of the request and reply
   messages with Forward search bit set for forward search inter-domain
   path computation.  Each of the request and reply messages mentioned
   below has its Forward search bit set even though we do not indicate
   this explicitly.

   In the case that a reply message is a final reply, which contains the
   optimal path from the source to the destination, the reply message is
   sent toward the PCC along the path that the request message goes from
   the PCC to the current PCE in reverse direction.

   In the case that a request message is to be sent to the PCE for node
   D with the minimum cost in the candidate node list and there is a PCE

Internet-Draft          Forward Search P2MP Path          September 2012


   session between the current domain and the next domain containing
   node D, the current PCE sends the PCE for node D through the session
   a request message with the source node, the destination node,
   CandidateNodeList and ResultPathTree.

   In the case that a request message is to be sent to the PCE for node
   D and there is not any PCE session between the current PCE and the
   PCE for node D, a reply message is sent toward a branch point on the
   result path tree from the current domain along the path that the
   request message goes from the PCC to the current PCE in reverse
   direction.  From the branch point, there is a downward path to the
   domain containing the previous hop node of node D on the result path
   tree and to the domain containing node D. At this branch point, the
   request message is sent to the PCE for node D along the downward
   path.

   Suppose that node D has the minimum cost in CandidateNodeList when a
   PCE receives a request message or a reply message containing
   CandidateNodeList.

   When a PCE (current PCE) for a domain (current domain) receives a
   reply message PCRep, it checks whether the reply is a final reply
   with the optimal path from the source to the destination(s).  If the
   reply is the final reply, the current PCE sends the reply to the PCE
   that sends the request to the current PCE; otherwise, it checks
   whether there is a path from the current domain to the domain
   containing the previous hop node of node D on ResultPathTree and to
   the domain containing node D. If there is a path, the PCE sends a
   request PCReq to the PCE responsible for the next domain along the
   path; otherwise, it sends a reply PCRep to the PCE that sends the
   request to the current PCE.

   When a PCE receives a request PCReq, it checks whether the current
   domain contains node D. If it does, then node D is removed from
   CandidateNodeList and grafted to ResultPathTree (i.e., set flag bit T
   of node D to one), and the above steps in the previous sub section
   are repeated; otherwise, the PCE sends a request PCReq to the PCE
   responsible for the next domain along the path from the current
   domain to the domain containing the previous hop node of node D on
   ResultPathTree and to the domain containing node D.

6.  Comparision with BRPC based Core Tree path computation procedure

   [RFC5441] describes the Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC)
   algorithm or procedure for computing an MPLS TE P2P LSP path from a
   source node to a destination node crossing multiple domains.
   [PCE-P2MP-PROCEDURES] describes extended BRPC based procedures to
   compute Core Tree.

Internet-Draft          Forward Search P2MP Path          September 2012


   Comparing to Core Tree, there are a number of differences between
   Core Tree and the Forward-Search P2MP TE LSP Inter-Domain Path
   Computation.  Some of the differences are briefed below.

   At first, Core Tree is for computing an optimal path from source node
   to each entry node of destination domain(s) by crossing multiple
   domains.  Once the core tree is built, then graft the destination
   nodes to core tree.  The Forward-Search P2MP TE LSP Inter-Domain Path
   Computation is for computing a shortest path from a source node to a
   number of destination nodes crossing multiple domains.

   Secondly, for Core Tree to compute an optimal path from a source node
   to each entry node of destination domain(s) by crossing multiple
   domains, we MUST provide a sequence of domains from the source node
   to each destination node in advance.  The Forward-Search P2MP TE LSP
   Inter-Domain Path Computation does not need any sequence of domains
   for computing a shortest inter-domain P2MP path.

   Moreover, for a given sequence of domains domain(1), domain(2), ...
   ,domain(n), BRPC computes an optimal path from domain(n-1), to
   domain(n-2), until domain(1) for destination node(n) and the same is
   repeated for all the destination nodes.  So each sub-path insures
   that it is a optimal path along the given sequence of domains.  It
   may not be a optimal path if the optimal path from the source to the
   destination node (n) is not in the given sequence of domains.  Thus
   the combination of these sub-paths into a P2MP tree may not be
   optimal.  The Forward-Search P2MP TE LSP Inter-Domain Path
   Computation calculates a shortest path in a special topology from the
   source node to the destination nodes using CSPF and it guarantees the
   path is optimal.

7.  Extensions to PCEP

   This section describes the extensions to PCEP for Forward Search P2MP
   Path Computation.  The extensions include the definition of a new
   flag in the RP object, a result path list and a candidate node list
   in the PCReq and PCRep message which are explained in details in
   [FORWARD-SEARCH-P2P-PATH].

7.1.  RP Object Extension

   [FORWARD-SEARCH-P2P-PATH] added following flags into the RP Object:

   The F bit is added in the flag bits field of the RP object to tell
   the receiver of the message that the request/reply is for Forward
   Search Path Computation.

   The T bit is added in the flag bits field of the RP object to tell

Internet-Draft          Forward Search P2MP Path          September 2012


   the receiver of the message that the reply is for transferring a
   request message to the domain containing the node with minimum cost
   in the candidate list.

   Setting Transfer request T-bit in a RP Object to one indicates that a
   reply message containing the RP Object is for transferring a request
   message to the domain containing the node with minimum cost in the
   candidate list.

   This F bit with the N bit defined in [RFC6006] can indicate whether
   the request/reply is for Forward Search Path Computation of an MPLS
   TE P2P LSP or an MPLS TE P2MP LSP.

7.2.  Request Message Extension

   Below is the message format for a request message with the extension
   of result-path-list and candidate-node-list:

              <PCReq Message>::= <Common Header>
                                 <request>
              <request>::= <RP>

   The result-path-list and candidate-node-list are as defined in
   [FORWARD-SEARCH-P2P-PATH].

7.3.  Reply Message Extension

   Below is the message format for a reply message with the extension of
   result-path-list and candidate-node-list:

                                           <path>

                                [<IRO>]

   The result-path-list and candidate-node-list are as defined in
   [FORWARD-SEARCH-P2P-PATH].

   If the path from the source to the destination is not found yet and
   there are still chances to find a path (i.e., the candidate list is
   not empty), the reply message contains candidate-node-list consisting
   of the information of the candidate-node-list and result-path-list,
   which is encoded.  In this case, the Transfer request T-bit in the RP
   Object is set to one.

   If the path from the source to the destination is found, the reply
   message contains path-list comprising the information of the path.

8.  Suggestion to improve performance

   To get much better performance all the candidate nodes of current
   domain can be expanded before moving on to a new domain.  Note in
   this, after expanding the least cost candidate node, PCE can look for
   and expand any other candidates(irrespective of cost) in this domain.

9.  Manageability Considerations

9.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   TBD
