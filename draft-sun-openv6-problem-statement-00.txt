                  Problem Statement for Openv6 Scheme
                 draft-sun-openv6-problem-statement-00

Abstract

   The IPv6 transition has been an ongoing process throughout the world
   due to the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space.  However, this
   transition leads to costly end-to-end network upgrades and poses new
   challenges of managing a large number of devices with a variety of
   transitioning protocols.  While IPv6 transition tools exist, there
   are still new issues exist.  Operators may need various types of IPv6
   transition technologies depending on performance requirements,
   deployment scenarios, etc.

   To address these difficulties, a unifying approach would provide a
   unified way to deploy IPv6 in a cost-effective, flexible manner.

   This document describes issues for deploying multiple transition
   technologies during the whole IPv6 transition period.  It also
   discusses potential technical gaps to achieve this work.

1.  Introduction

   The exhaustion of the IPv4 address space has been a practical problem
   that providers are facing today.  Network address migration to IPv6
   is ongoing or upcoming throughout the world.  However, IPv6 requires
   costly end-to-end network upgrades and different network scenarios
   will co-exist during IPv6 transition.  Therefore, operators have to
   upgrade network devices to support different transition tools, or buy
   new devices for different scenarios.

Internet-Draft          Openv6 Problem Statement            October 2013


   It is more efficient to unify the transition technologies thanks to a
   Transition Data Plane (TDP).  The TDP deals with flow-table mapping
   and is unaware of specific transition technologies.  The service-
   awareness is provided by a Transition Management Server (TMS).  The
   TMS uses IPv6 Transition Service Modules (ITSM) to know the
   characteristics of each technology.  Finally, the TMS provides a
   Northbound Interface (NBI) that enables the ITSM to manipulate the
   traffic for different scenarios.  This approach unifies the variety
   of IPv6 transition mechanisms in a cost-effective, flexible manner.

   This document describes issues arising from deploying multiple
   transition technologies during the whole IPv6 transition period.  It
   also discusses potential technical gaps for the unified solution.

2.  Terminology

3.  Unified Openv6 Use case

3.1.  Evolve from one Scenario to Another

   During the IPv6 transition period, the network needs three stages of
   IPv4-only, dual-stack and IPv6-only.  The networks should support
   both IPv4 services and IPv6 services at each
   stage.[One-vision-for-IPv6]

   There are multiple IPv6 transition technologies for different network
   scenarios (e.g. IPv4 network for IPv4/IPv6 user access, IPv6 network
   for IPv4/IPv6 user access, IPv4 servers for IPv6 visitors, etc.).
   Different network scenarios will co-exist during IPv6 transition
   which means the IPv6 transition device should support multiple IPv6
   transition technologies.  The following are possible scenarios in the
   whole IPv6 transition period.

      1)Scenario 1: IPv6 host visit IPv6 servers via IPv4 access network

      2)Scenario 2: IPv4 host visit IPv4 servers via IPv4 NAT Dual-stack
      network

      3)Scenario 3: IPv6 host visit IPv6 servers via IPv6 network

      4)Scenario 4: IPv4 host visit IPv4 servers via IPv6 access network

      5)Scenario 5: IPv6 host visit IPv6 servers via IPv4 access network

      6)Scenario 6: IPv4 host and IPv6 host interaction

   It is not necessary that every operator will go through each scenario
   one by one.  For example, some operators may start from scenario 1,



Sun, et al.              Expires April 24, 2014                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          Openv6 Problem Statement            October 2013


   and some may start directly from scenario 2 or scenario 4.  However,
   since the final stage (target) is the IPv6-only access network, one
   still need to undergo multiple scenarios from the long term.

   In such a case, the operator should either upgrade existing devices
   to support new features, or replace them with new ones.  In
   particular, when the operator's network consists of devices from
   different vendors, it is hard to guarantee that all the legacy
   devices can be upgraded at the same time.  This is costly and
   complicated.

   The issues are:

      1.  How to manipulate Transition Data Plane(TDP) with different
      modes?

      2.  How to identify the capabilities of different transition
      devices ?

      3.  How does the Transition Data Plane (TDP) identify different
      modes in the unified platform ?

3.2.  Multiple Transition Mechanisms Co-Exist

   In transition from one scenario to another, different transition
   mechanisms may have different impacts on user experience.  For
   example, DS-Lite would have some impact due to address sharing
   compared to 6rd mechanisms, and NAT64 would have extra impact due to
   ALG issue.  Operators may prepare a fallback mechanism to guarantee
   the same level of user experience when there are complaints from
   subscribers.  Therefore, it is required to support multiple
   transition mechanisms in the same area.

   Another use case is that multiple scenarios may exist in the same
   stage.  For example, if there are both IPv6-only devices and
   IPv4-only host in the same area with limited public IPv4 address,
   both NAT64 and NAT44 (or DS-Lite) are required to achieve IPv4
   service connectivity.

   Current implementations normally use a separate instance for each
   mechanism,, and additional policies need to be applied when running
   multiple mechanisms in one device.  Some have a limitation on the
   number of policies which can be configured in one device, while some
   have restrictions regarding the resource occupation (e.g. one
   transition instance will occupy a static amount of memory).  The
   major challenges of IPv6 deployment mainly lie in two aspects:





Sun, et al.              Expires April 24, 2014                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          Openv6 Problem Statement            October 2013


      The need to implement different IPv6 transition technologies in
      the same hardware and the need to support this by upgrading
      network devices as little as possible.

      The need to hop over legacy infrastructures which are not IPv6
      enabled, costly or impossible to upgrade.

   The issues are:

      1.  How to support multiple transition mechanisms in a cost-
      efficient and flexible way ?

      2.  How to easily identify the transition type of different
      subscribers ?

3.3.  Scattered Address Pool Management

   When operators are facing with address shortage problem, the
   remaining IPv4 address pools are usually quite scattered.  It is
   quite complicated for an operator to manage scattered address pools
   in many transition devices.  The situation will become even worse
   when multiple transition mechanisms in the same device need to be
   configured with different address pools.  Besides, since the
   occupation of the address pools may vary during different transition
   periods, (e.g.  when there is not many IPv6-enabled services and
   IPv6-enabled devices, IPv4 traffic will still occupy a great portion
   of the total traffic, while in the later stage of IPv6 transition,
   IPv4 traffic will decrease and the amount of IPv4 address pools will
   decrease accordingly.

   The ideal way is to manage the address pools centrally.  Different
   transition mechanisms can require the address pools on-demand.  For
   example, when one transition mechanism is running out of the current
   address pools,it may request a additional address pool.  It can also
   release the address pools that it is not using anymore.  In this way,
   operators do not need to configure the address pools one by one
   manually and it also helps using the address pools more efficiently.

   The issues are:

      1.  How to configure the address pools for different mechanisms ?

      2.  How to collect the current status of address pool usage ?

3.4.  Extensibility

   In migration from IPv4 to IPv6, different scenarios usually need
   different solutions.  Although IETF has already invented some

Internet-Draft          Openv6 Problem Statement            October 2013


   mechanisms including DS-Lite[RFC6333], XLate[RFC6146], BIH[RFC6535],
   NAT64[RFC6146], etc., However, the current solutions have solved the
   following scenarios only in a limited way:

      *IPv4 client communicates to IPv6 server

      *IPv4 client communicates to IPv6 peer

   It is possible that new technologies will be invented in the future.
   In addition, some mechanism are still evolving from a session-based
   solution (e.g. DS-Lite) to a more scalable way (e.g. lw4over6, MAP).
   It might be possible that operators who have already deployed one
   solution may upgrade to a better one in the future.  Besides, IPv6
   transition can also be regarded as a virtualized network function
   which can be offered to a third-party.

   Therefore, it is required to offer an open and programmable way to
   easily add new features without modifying existing device hardware.

   The issues are :

   1.  How to add a new module to the transition data plane ?

   2.  How to offer the capability for the possible future technologies?

4.  Coexistence of IPv6 Transition Technologies

   The different network environments (architecture, scale, services
   deployed, varying IP traffic) cause a variety of IPv6 transition
   technologies for different operators.  This section analyzes the
   current and future coexistence of IPv6 transition technologies
   situation as well as the issues behind it.

   Since IPv6 was proposed, there have been a couple of RFCs and on-
   going documents in IETF, as listed in the table below.

          Table 1: A Table of IPv6 Transition Technologies @ IETF

   The situation described above depicts the difficulty of selecting
   appropriate IPv6 transition technologies for the carriers.  Moreover,
   according to [SD-NAT], there are multiple stages during the whole
   IPv6 transition period, and a variety of technologies and equipments
   are used during different IPv6 transition stages.  To protect the
   user experience and the early investment, an operator will not
   upgrade its network directly to the final stage of IPv6 transition.
   During different IPv6 transition stages, an operator needs different
   technologies in different stages.  Thus, a method that is able to
   implement different IPv6 transition technologies in the same hardware
   is crucial, to avoid repeated investments.
