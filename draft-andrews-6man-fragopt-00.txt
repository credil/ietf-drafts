          IPv6 Stateless Fragmentation Identification Options
                   draft-andrews-6man-fragopt-00.txt

Abstract

   Fragmented IPv6 packets are often dropped because there is no way to
   identify whether a fragment matches a otherwise permitted packet as
   the L4 header information is not available on all the fragments.

   The document defines hop-by-hop options that can be used to supply
   the missing information in non initial fragments.

1.  Introduction

   Fragmented IPv6 packets are often dropped because there is no way to
   identify whether a fragment matches a otherwise permitted packet as
   the L4 header information is not available on all the fragments.

   The document defines hop-by-hop options that can be used to supply
   the missing information in non initial fragments.

   The informtion required differs depending upon the L4 packet.  For
   TCP and UDP the source and destination ports are needed.  For ICMP
   the type of ICMP packet is needed.

   These options are expected to be used by middle boxes (firewalls and
   loadbalancers) and end nodes.


2.  TCP and UDP Fragements

   For TCP and UDP a skippable hop-by-hop option [RFC2460] (for
   backwards compatibilty) containing the source and destination ports
   from the TCP and UDP headers is needed.  To permit the use of NATs,
   however undesired, the option contents are marked changable enroute.
   The option code has nmemonic PORTS and value (TBD) and is added to
   all fragments of UDP and TCP packets when they are fragmented.  By
   adding the option to all fragments you reduce the amount of
   fragmentation reassembly failures that would result if you only added
   the option to non-initial fragments and were dropping non-initial
   fragments without this option.

3.  Security Considerations

   The use of these options will expose nodes to more fragmention based
   attacks and potentually more traffic which will ultimately be dropped
   if a attacker can guess which option values will be permitted.

   With the exception of the fragmentation based attacks, permitting
   fragments with these options is no worse that permitting multiple
   unfragmented packets based in the same parameters.
