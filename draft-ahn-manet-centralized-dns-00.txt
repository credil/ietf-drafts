Internet-Draft      A Centralized MANET DNS Mechanism      December 2011


Abstract

   This document describes a Domain Name System (DNS) mechanism for the
   MANET based on the centralized DNS mechanism used in the wired
   Internet. In order to adapt to the dynamic topology changes of the
   MANET, the mechanism handles the movement of the DNS server and the
   MANET merge/partition.

Internet-Draft      A Centralized MANET DNS Mechanism      December 2011


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   
2.  Introduction

   The centralized DNS mechanism works based on unicast communications,
   so it is more efficent in the resource-limited MANET than the
   multicast-based DNS mechanisms proposed in [1][2].

   However, the centralized DNS mechanism may confront with the
   following problems in the MANET environment.

     - the problem of server non-existence
     - the problem of frequent updates of the IP address and domain name
       bindings

   In this draft, we describe how to adapt the centralized DNS mechanism
   to the MANET by resolving the above mentioned problems.

  
3.  Terminology

   TBD.     


4.  Operations


4.1 DNS Server Discovery

   MANET nodes discover the DNS server by sending the DSN Server
   Solicitation and the DNS Server Advertisement messages. The node
   wishing to obtain the address of the DNS server broadcasts a DNS
   Server Solicitation message and waits for a DNS Server Advertisement
   message from the DNS server. If no DNS Server Advertisement message
   is received for the given time interval, the node assumes that there
   is no DNS server and broadcasts a DNS Server Advertisement message to
   announce itself as the DNS server. If there exists the DNS server,
   the DNS server will receive the DNS Server Solicitation message and
   unicasts a DNS Server Advertisement message to the requesting node
   as a response. The DNS server is required to broadcast DNS Server
   Advertisement messages periodically to announce its existence.

4.2 Maintenance of Domain Names and Binding Information

   A node registers its domain name by unicasting a DNS Register message
   to the DNS server and the server determines whether the domain name
   is already used by another node or not.

   To request for the name service, a node unicasts a DNS Name Query
   message to the DNS server and, then, the DNS server reponses to the
   request by unicasting the corresponding DNS Name Response message.

   If a node wants to change its domain name, it unicasts a DNS Name
   Change message with its new domain name to the DNS server. If a node
   wishes to leave the MANET, it sends a DNS Name Release message to
   the DNS server.


4.3 Network Merge and Partition

   If a node receives no DNS Server Advertisement message from the DNS
   server for the given time interval, it assumes that the DNS server
   does not exist in the network any more. Then, the node becomes the
   new DNS server and broadcasts a DNS Server Advertisement message.

   Due to node or DNS server movement, there may exist more than one
   DNS server within the MANET. The multiple DNS server existence can be
   detected by a DNS server when it receives a DNS Server Advertisement
   message from another DNS server. In that case, only one DNS server
   with the highest priority is chosen as the DNS server by using a
   given tie breaking rule. The DNS server with a lower priority gives
   up its role as the DNS server and hands over its DNS name table to
   the highest priority DNS server by sending a DNS Register message.

   TBD.


6.  Other Considerations

   TBD.
