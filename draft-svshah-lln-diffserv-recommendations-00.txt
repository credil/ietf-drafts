      Differentiated Service Class Recommendations for LLN Traffic
              draft-svshah-lln-diffserv-recommendations-00

Abstract

   Differentiated services architecture is widely deployed in
   traditional networks.  There exist well defined recommendations for
   the use of appropriate differentiated service classes for different
   types of traffic (eg. audio, video) in these networks.  Per-Hop
   Behaviors are typically defined based on this recommendations.  With
   emerging Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), traffic originated in a
   LLN, such as metering, command and control, may transit over a
   converged campus IP network, or even a Wide Area Network, and will
   share resources with traditional classes of traffic such as voice,
   video and data.  It is important to have defined differentiated
   services recommendations for LLN traffic to co-exist with traditional
   class of traffic.

Internet-Draft          Diffserv for LLN traffic               July 2012


1.  Introduction

   With emerged LLNs, it is anticipated that more and more such networks
   will be connected to existing Campus, WANs, Provider core networks.
   As deployments of LLNs grow, traffic out of such Networks will also
   grow which is to co-exist with traditional types of traffic.  Per-Hop
   Behaviors (PHB) and Inter-domain Service Level Agreements (SLAs), not
   only at the LLN Border but also in the managed IP networks, will have
   to be defined considering all types of traffic.

   We will first categorize different types of LLN traffic into service
   classes and then provide recommendations for Differentiated Service
   Code-Point(DSCP) for those service classes.  Mechanisms to be used,
   like Traffic Conditioning and Active Queue Management, for
   differentiated services is well defined in RFC4594.  This document
   does not focus to re-call them again here but the document will call
   out any specific mechanism that requires particular consideration.
   Though nodes inside LLNs MAY use code-points recommended here.

   This document focuses on Diffserv recommendations for LLN class of
   traffic in managed IP networks outside of LLNs that is for the
   traffic from LLN to the Campus, WAN, Provider Core as well as for the
   traffic in the reverse direction.  It does not focus on Diffserv
   architecture or any other QoS recommendations within the LLNs.  Given
   constraints of LLNs and their unique requirements, it is expected of
   a focus within a separate efforts.

   In Section 3 we categorize different types of traffic from Different
   LLNs.  Section 4 recommends differentiated services, including DSCPs
   and QoS mechanics, for categorized classes of traffic.  Section 5
   evaluates one of the deployment scenario.

1.1.  Definitions

    DSCP: Differentiated Service Code Point. It is a 6-bits value in the
          TOS and Traffic Class field of the IPv4 and IPv6 header
          respectively. This 6-bits numerical value defines standard set
          of behavior to be performed by Differentiated Services capable
          hops.

    Diffserv
    Class: Diffser Class in this document is used to refer to DSCP code-
           point(s) and associated Per-hop Behaviors for it.

    LLN: Low-power and lossy Network. Network constructed with sensors,
         actuators, routers that are low-power and with higher loss/
         success transmission ratio, due to transmission medium and
         nature of dynamics of changing topology, compare to wired and
         other traditional networks.

    SLA: Service Level Agreement. It is a collection of Traffic
         classification rules and set of services associated with each
         Traffic Class. Traffic classification may be defined based
         on just DSCP code-points or additionally (or otherwise)
         based on some other packet attributes.

    WAN: Wide Area Network. Broader area of network that connects
         multiple LANs, LLNs to each other including LAN, LLN networks
         from different sites across regions.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.


3.  Application Types and Traffic Patterns

      Different types of traffic can be collapsed into following network
      service classes.

      - Alert signals
      - Critical control signals
      - Monitoring data
        - Video data
        - Query-based response data
        - Periodic reporting/logging, Software downloads

3.1.  Alert signals

   Alerts/alarms reporting fall in this category where such signal is
   triggered in a rare un-usual circumstances.  An alert may be
   triggered for an example when environmental hazard level goes beyond
   certain threshold.  Such alerts require to be reported with in the
   human tolerable time.  Note that certain critical alert reporting in
   certain automation systems may be reported via very closely and
   tightly managed method that is not implemented within LLNs, due to
   the nature of transmission media of LLNs and due to the stringent
   latency requirement for those alerts.  Such types of signals are not
   considered here since they are not within the scope of LLN or any
   other IP networks.

Examples :
    - Environmental hazard level goes beyond certain threshold
    - Measured blood pressure exceeds the threshold or a person falls to
      the ground
    - Instructional triggers like start/stop traffic lights during
      certain critical event

Traffic Pattern:

   Typically size of such packets is very small. any specific device of
   LLN is expected to trigger only handful of packets (may be only 1
   packet).  That too only during an event which is not a common
   occurrence.

   In an affected vicinity, only a designated device or each affected
   devices may send alerts.  In certain type of sensor networks, it is
   predictable and expected to have only a designated device to trigger
   such an alert while in certain other types scale number of alert
   flows may be expected.

   Latency required for such traffic is not stringent but is to be
   within human tolerable time bound.

3.2.  Control signals

   Besides alerts, LLNs also trigger and/or receive different types of
   control signals, to/from control applications outside of LLNs.  These
   control signals are important enough for the operation of sensors,
   actuators and underneath network.  Administrator controlling
   applications, outside of LLN network, may trigger a control signal in
   response to alerts/data received from LLN (in some cases control
   signal trigger may be automated without explicit human interaction in
   the loop) or administrator may trigger an explicit control signal for
   a specific function.

Internet-Draft          Diffserv for LLN traffic               July 2012


 Examples:
     - auto [demand] response (e.g. manage peak load, service
                                   disconnect, start/stop street lights)
     - manual remote service disconnect, remote demand reset

     - open-loop regulatory control
     - non-critical close-loop regulatory control
     - trigger to start Video surveillance


 Traffic Pattern:

   Variable size packets but typically size of such packets is small.
   Certain control signals may be regular and so with number of devices
   in a particular LLN, it is predictable on average, how many such
   signals to expect.  However, certain other control signals are
   irregular or on-demand.

   Typically most of the open-loop, that requires manual interaction,
   signals are tolerant to latency above 1 second.  Certain close-loop
   control signals require low jitter and low latency, latency in the
   order of 100s of ms.

   Some of the tightly coupled closed loop control signals are very
   sensitive to latency and jitter.  However they today, just like
   critical alerts, are implemented via other management methods outside
   of LLN.

3.3.  Monitoring data

   Reaction to control signals may initiate flow of data-traffic in
   either direction.  Sensors/Actuators in LLNs may also trigger
   periodic data (eg. monitoring, reporting data).  All different types
   of data may be categorized in following classes.

3.3.1.  Video data

   A very common example of this type of monitoring data is Video
   surveillance or Video feed, triggered thru control signals.  This
   Video feed is typically from LLN towards an application outside of
   LLN.

   Traffic Pattern:

   Video frame size is expected to be big with a flow of variable rate.

Internet-Draft          Diffserv for LLN traffic               July 2012


3.3.2.  Query based data

   Application at the controller, outside the LLN, or user explicitly
   may launch query for the data.  For example, query for an urban
   environmental data, query for health report etc.  Since this data is
   query based data, it is important to report data with reasonable
   latency though not stringent.  In addition, some periodic logging
   data also may require timely reporting and so may expect same type of
   service (eg. at-home health reporting).

   Traffic Pattern:

   Size of packets can vary from small to big.  While rate may be
   predictable in some cases, in most of the cases traffic rate for such
   data is variable.  The traffic is bursty in the nature.

3.3.3.  Periodic reporting/logging, Software downloads

   Many sensors/actuator in different LLNs report data periodically.
   With some exceptions, as mentioned above for healthcare monitoring
   logs, most of such data do not have any latency requirement and can
   be forwarded either thru lower priority assured forwarding or with
   service of store and forward or even best effort.

   Sensors/actuators may require software/firmware upgrades where
   software/ firmware may be downloaded on demand bases.  These upgrades
   and so downloads do not have stringent requirement of timely delivery
   to the accuracy of seconds.  This data also can be forwarded thru
   lower priority assured forwarding.

   Traffic Pattern:

   Periodic reporting/logging typically can be predicated as constant
   rate.  Data may be bursty in the nature.  Software download data also
   may be bursty in nature.  Such traffic is tolerant to jitter and
   latency.

4.  Differentiated Service recommendations for LLN traffic

4.1.  Alert signals

   Alerts/alarms signaling service requires transmission of few packets
   with low delay, tolerable to human.  This requirement is very similar
   to signaling traffic in the traditional networks.  Alert signals MAY
   use Diffserv code-point CS5.

Internet-Draft          Diffserv for LLN traffic               July 2012


4.2.  Control signals

   As described in earlier section, control signals over IP are divided
   in two categories.  Control signals that require very low latency,
   service inline with EF PHB, and control signals that require low
   delay but do not mandate lowest latency.  Service requirement for
   later class of control signals is very similar to service for
   signaling traffic in the traditional networks.  Recommendation for
   this class of control signals is to use Diffserv code-point CS5.

   Control signals, like some of the closed-loop signals, that require
   lower delay and jitter compare to CS5 class of control signals, are
   recommended to use EF Diffserv class.  These control signals are
   expected to be of the small packet size and short-lived flows.
   Specifically while sharing EF class with voice traffic, any big
   control packets can cause additional latency to voice packets and so
   care MUST be taken either to use a different Diffserv class for them
   or compress such packets to smaller size.

4.3.  Monitoring Data

4.3.1.  Video Data

   RFC4594 has well documented recommendations for different types of
   Video traffic.  If there is any Video traffic from/to LLNs to/from
   outside of LLNs, they should use same recommended dscp from RFC4594.
   For example, surveillance video feed is recommended to use dscp CS3.

4.3.2.  Query based data

   Low latency data, like query based report and non-critical signals,
   is recommended to use AF2 assured forwarding service.  Also, certain
   periodic reporting/logging data that are critical to be reported with
   regular interval with relatively low jitter is recommended to use
   AF2x service.

4.3.3.  Periodic reporting/logging, Software downloads

   Non-critical periodic reporting/logging and rest all other data MAY
   use AF1x or BE service class.

5.  Deployment Scenario

   Industrial Automation, as described in [RFC5673] and [ISA100.11a],
   classifies different types of traffic in following six classes
   ranging in complexity from Class 5 to Class 0 where Class 0 is the
   most time sensitive class.

    o  Safety

      *  Class 0: Emergency action - Always a critical function

    o  Control

      *  Class 1: Closed-loop regulatory control - Often a critical
         function

      *  Class 2: Closed-loop supervisory control - Usually a non-
         critical function

      *  Class 3: Open-loop control - Operator takes action and controls
         the actuator (human in the loop)

   o  Monitoring

      *  Class 4: Alerting - Short-term operational effect (for example,
         event-based maintenance)

      *  Class 5: Logging and downloading / uploading - No immediate
         operational consequence (e.g., history collection, sequence-of-
         events, preventive maintenance)

    It might not be appropriate to transport Class 0 traffic over a
    wireless network or a multihop network, unless tight mechanisms are
    put in place such as TDM and frequency hopping. Today this class of
    traffic is expected to use other tightly managed method outside of
    IP networks. Excluding class 0 traffic, following table maps Class 1
    thru Class 5 service classes to Diffserv code-point.

     -------------------------
    |  Service      | DSCP    |
    |   Class       |         |
    |===============+=========|
    |   Class 1*    | EF      |
    +-------------------------+
    |   Class 2     | CS5     |
    +-------------------------+
    |   Class 3     | CS5     |
    +-------------------------+
    |   Class 4     | AF2x    |
    +-------------------------+
    |   class 5     | AF1x/BE |
    +-------------------------+

    * Any Class 1 traffic that requires very tight control over latency
    and jitter falls in the same category as Class 0 traffic.

6.  Security Considerations

   A typical trust model, as much is applicable in traditional networks,
   is applicable with LLN traffic as well.  At the border of the LLN, a
   trust model needs to be established for any traffic coming out of
   LLN.  Without appropriate trust model to accept/mark dscp code-point
   for LLN traffic, misbehaving flow may attack a specific Diffserv
   class disrupting expected service for other traffic from the same
   Diffserv class.  Trust models are typically established at the border
   router by employing rate-limiting and even marking down dscp code-
   point to Best Effort for non-trusted flows or dropping them as
   required.
