Internet-Draft          The action Link Relation            January 2013


1.  Introduction

   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] defined the way of indicating resources on the
   Web. This specification defines link relation type that may be used
   to express the relationships between a resource and associated
   actions that may be performed against context resource.

   The "action" link relation is intentionally generic, and it can be
   used with multiple media types in a wide variety of use cases.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Link Relations

   The following link relations are defined.

3.1.  The "action" Link Relation Type

   When included in a response, the "action" link relation indicates a
   target resource that is responsible for performing action which MAY:

   o   Affect state of the context resource; or

   o   Initiate process.

   The "action" link relation can be used to indicate the availability
   of actions that MAY be performed by the target resource.  Examples of
   such actions include:

   o   Enable/disable

   o   Publish/unpublish

   o   Reset resource to its initial state

   o   Restart service

   o   Replicate or migrate data

Internet-Draft          The action Link Relation            January 2013


   Example "action" link expressed as a Link header field:

   Link: </posts/1/publisher>;
         rel="action"; title="Publish"

   Actual function to be performed by the server, MAY be advertised by
   including an extension link relation types as defined per Section 4.2
   of [RFC5988].  For example:

   Link: </posts/1/publisher>;
         rel="action http://rels.domain.org/publish"; title="Publish"

   indicates that a target resource is responsible for accepting request
   and performing action(signified by the "action" link relation), and
   the "http://rels.domain.org/publish" extension link relation
   indicates that successful request will change the state of the
   context resource from unpublished to published.

3.1.1.  Using the "action" Link Relation

   In order to perform action, clients SHOULD send an empty POST request
   to the target resource.

   Interaction Diagram:

   Client                                  Server
      |                                       |
      | 1) POST to Target URI                 |
      |-------------------------------------->|
      |                                       |
      |                 2) Validate Request   |
      |                   +-------------------|
      |                   |                   |
      |                   +------------------>|
      |                                       |
      | 2.1) If Error: Respond with           |
      |      a 4xx status code                |
      |<--------------------------------------|
      |                                       |
      |          3) Perform Requested Action  |
      |                   +-------------------|
      |                   |                   |
      |                   +------------------>|
      |                                       |
      | 4) Respond with a 2xx or 3xx          |
      |    Status Code                        |
      |<--------------------------------------|

      1.  The client sends an empty POST request to the target URI.

      2.  The server validates request.

        2.1.  If error, the server responds with a 4xx status code.

      3.  The server performs requested action.

      4.  The server responds with a 2xx or 3xx status code.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the "action" link relation below as per
   [RFC5988].

4.1.  The Link Relation Registration "action"

   Relation Name:

      action

   Description:

      The target IRI points to a resource that is responsible to perform
      an action that may affect state of the context resource or
      initiate process.

   Security considerations:

      Automated agents should take care when this relation crosses
      administrative domains (e.g., the URI has a different authority
      than the current document).

   Reference:

      See Section 3.

5.  Security Considerations

   See Section 7 of RFC5988 [RFC5988].

6.  Internationalisation Considerations

   See Section 8 of RFC5988 [RFC5988].

              Requirement Levels", BCP 14, RFC 2119, March 1997.
