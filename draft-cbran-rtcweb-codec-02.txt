Internet-Draft                WebRTC Codec                    March 2012


1.  Introduction

   An integral part of the success and adoption of the Web Real Time
   Communications (WebRTC) will be the voice and video interoperability
   between WebRTC applications.  This specification will outline the
   media processing and codec requirements for WebRTC client
   implementations.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Codec Requirements

   This section covers the audio and video codec requirements for WebRTC
   client applications.  To ensure a baseline level of interoperability
   between WebRTC clients, a minimum set of required codecs are
   specified below.  While this section specifies the codecs that will
   be mandated for all WebRTC client implementations, it leaves the
   question of supporting additional codecs to the will of the
   implementer.

3.1.  Audio Codec Requirements

   WebRTC clients are REQUIRED to implement the following audio codecs.

   o  PCMA/PCMU - 1 channel with a rate of 8000 Hz and a ptime of 20 -
      see section 4.5.14 of [RFC3551]

   o  Telephone Event - [RFC4734]

   o  Opus [draft-ietf-codec-opus]

   For all cases where the client is able to process audio at a sampling
   rate higher than 8 kHz, it is RECOMMENDED that Opus be offered before
   PCMA/PCMU.  For Opus, all modes MUST be supported, for all ptime
   values up to 120 ms.  Clients MAY use the offer/answer mechanism to
   signal a preference for a particular mode or ptime.

3.2.  Video Codec Requirements

   The following feature list applies to all required video codecs.

   Required video codecs:

   o  MUST support at least 10 frames per second (fps) and SHOULD
      support 30 fps

   o  If VP8 is supported, then it MUST support the bilinear and none
      reconstruction filters

   o  OPTIONALLY offer support for additional color spaces

   o  MUST support a minimum resolution of 320X240

   o  SHOULD support resolutions of 1280x720, 720x480, 1024x768,
      800x600, 640x480, 640 x 360 , 320x240


4.  Audio Level

   It is desirable to standardize the "on the wire" audio level for
   speech transmission to avoid users having to manually adjust the
   playback and to facilitate mixing in conferencing applications.  It
   is also desirable to be consistent with ITU-T recommendations G.169
   and G.115, which recommend an active audio level of -19 dBm0.
   However, unlike G.169 and G.115, the audio for WebRTC is not
   constrained to have a passband specified by G.712 and can in fact be
   sampled at any sampling rate from 8 kHz to 48 kHz and up.  For this
   reason, the level SHOULD be normalized by only considering
   frequencies above 300 Hz, regardless of the sampling rate used.  The
   level SHOULD also be adapted to avoid clipping, either by lowering
   the gain to a level below -19 dBm0, or through the use of a
   compressor.

   AUTHORS' NOTE: The idea of using the same level as what the ITU-T
   recommends is that it should improve inter-operability while at the
   same time maintaining sufficient dynamic range and reducing the risk
   of clipping.  The main drawbacks are that the resulting level is
   about 12 dB lower than typical "commercial music" levels and it
   leaves room for ill-behaved clients to be much louder than a normal
   client.  While using music-type levels is not really an option (it
   would require using the same compressor-limitors that studios use),
   it would be possible to have a level slightly higher (e.g. 3 dB) than
   what is recommended above without causing interoperability problems.

   Assuming 16-bit PCM with a value of +/-32767, -19 dBm0 corresponds to
   a root mean square (RMS) level of 2600.  Only active speech should be
   considered in the RMS calculation.  If the client has control over
   the entire audio capture path, as is typically the case for a regular
   phone, then it is RECOMMENDED that the gain be adjusted in such a way
   that active speech have a level of 2600 (-19 dBm0) for an average
   speaker.  If the client does not have control over the entire audio

   capture, as is typically the case for a software client, then the
   client SHOULD use automatic gain control (AGC) to dynamically adjust
   the level to 2600 (-19 dBm0) +/- 6 dB.  For music or desktop sharing
   applications, the level SHOULD NOT be automatically adjusted and the
   client SHOULD allow the user to set the gain manually.

   The RECOMMENDED filter for normalizing the signal energy is a second-
   order Butterworth filter with a 300 Hz cutoff frequency.

   It is common for the audio output on some devices to be "calibrated"
   for playing back pre-recorded "commercial" music, which is typically
   around 12 dB louder than the level recommended in this section.
   Because of this, clients MAY increase the gain before playback.


5.  Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC)

   It is plausible that the dominant near to mid-term WebRTC usage model
   will be people using the interactive audio and video capabilities to
   communicate with each other via web browsers running on a notebook
   computer that has built-in microphone and speakers.  The notebook-as-
   communication-device paradigm presents challenging echo cancellation
   problems, the specific remedy of which will not be mandated here.
   However, while no specific algorithm or standard will be required by
   WebRTC compatible clients, echo cancellation will improve the user
   experience and should be implemented by the endpoint device.

   SHOULD include an AEC and if not, SHOULD ensure that the speaker-to-
   microphone gain is below unity at all frequencies to avoid
   instability when none of the client has echo cancellation.  For
   clients that do not control the audio capture and playback devices
   directly, it is RECOMMENDED to support echo cancellation between
   devices running at slight different sampling rates, such as when a
   webcam is used for microphone.

   The client SHOULD allow either the entire AEC or the non-linear
   processing (NLP) to be turned off for applications, such as music,
   that do not behave well with the spectral attenuation methods
   typically used in NLPs.  It SHOULD have the ability to detect the
   presence of a headset and disable echo cancellation.

   For some applications where the remote client may not have an echo
   canceller, the local client MAY include a far-end echo canceller, but
   if that it the case, it SHOULD be disabled by default.

   Call control event notification to connected devices such as headsets
   (what's that exactly?)

6.  Legacy VoIP Interoperability

   The codec requirements above will ensure, at a minimum, voice
   interoperability capabilities between WebRTC client applications and
   legacy phone systems.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


8.  Security Considerations

   The codec requirements have no additional security considerations
   other than those captured in
   [I-D.ekr-security-considerations-for-rtc-web].


9.  Acknowledgements

   particularly we would like to acknowledge, and say thanks for, work
   we incorporated from Harald Alvestrand.
