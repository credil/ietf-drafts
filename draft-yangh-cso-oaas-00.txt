    Cross Stratum Optimization Architecture for Optical as a Service
                        draft-yangh-cso-oaas-00

Abstract

   Data centers based applications provide a wide variety of services
   such as cloud computing, video gaming, grid application and others.
   Currently application decisions are made with little information
   concerning underlying network used to deliver those services so that
   such decisions cannot be the most optimal from both network and
   application resource utilization and quality of service objectives.

   This document presents a novel architecture of Cross Stratum
   Optimization for application and network resource in dynamic optical
   networks.  Several global load balancing strategies are proposed and
   demonstrated by experiments in Optical as a Service experimental
   environment.

Internet-Draft          CSO Architecture for OaaS           October 2011


1.  Introduction

   With the emergence of cloud computing and high-bandwidth video
   applications such as live concerts, sporting events and remote
   medical surgery, various data center applications become more and
   more important, some Quality of Service related parameters of which
   have attracted much attention, such as jitter and latency.
   Therefore, there is a great need for a joint scheduling of network
   and application resources, the latter of which mainly refers to
   computing and storage resource, such as servers of various types and
   granularities (memory, disk, VMs).  Many studies have been focused on
   traffic awareness in application resource [1], especially cross layer
   optimization in optical network [2].  However, few of them have been
   involved in global combined optimization of network and application
   resources.

   This document proposes a novel architecture based on Cross Stratum
   Optimization (CSO) [3] that enables a joint application/network
   resource optimization, responsiveness to quickly change demands
   from/to application to/from network, enhanced service resilience (via
   cooperative recovery techniques between application and network) and
   quality of application experience (QoE) enhancement (via better use
   of current network and application resources).  This architecture is
   intended to enable Optical as a Service (OaaS) by enabling large-
   bandwidth and multi-granularities applications based on Adaptive
   Multi-service Optical Networks (AMSON) with an increased resource
   utilization and resiliency across the application and network
   stratums.  Four strategies including global load balancing (GLB),
   random based (RB), application resource based (AB) and network
   resource based (NB) strategies are proposed and validated in our
   experimental environment.  Experimental results show that GLB in CSO
   architecture performs more effective compared with others.

                       Fig.2 CSO schematic for OaaS

   The application stratum plane, service stratum plane and user plane
   are introduced in the novel architecture of CSO besides traditional
   planes, i.e., control plane, management plane and transport plane.
   The responsibility for centralized application stratum plane is
   concerned with maintaining application resources in data centers,
   while service stratum plane provides to application stratum the
   network resource information abstracted from control plane with NRAA.
   In addition, GLB computation is implemented based on both the
   application stratum and network stratum resources, while service
   stratum will enforce SA-PCE.  The responsibilities and interactions
   among these entities are provided below.

3.1.  AC

   AC comprises UA, SSE, DB and ARAE.  AC is responsible for interacting
   with user plane and obtaining network and application resource
   abstract information abstracted from SCs and DCNs.  AC completes the
   GLB computation based on them.  UA authenticates the user requests
   and maintains user information.  With GLB computation, SSE chooses
   the optimal server or VM for users, allocates application resources,
   and determines the location of the distributed application or where
   to migrate virtual machines.  ARAE provides to GLB computation the
   suited application resource abstract information obtained from DCNs,
   such as running state and idle resource of servers or VMs.

Internet-Draft          CSO Architecture for OaaS           October 2011


3.2.  SC

   SC is composed of SA, PA, PCE, NRAE and DBM.  Three main functional
   requirements for SC in OaaS architecture are described below.
   Firstly, SC provides network services to AC.  According to the type
   of services, SC computes the paths and drives control plane to
   establish the paths so as to implement the concept of OaaS.
   Secondly, SC offers to AC the resources abstract information
   including the mapping of application and optical layer, logical
   topology of optical layer and the status of network transmission for
   AC decision.  Finally, it provides to management plane the database
   interface so that network administrator can monitor it.

   SA communicates to AC with authentication and access control
   permission of transport network resources through ASI.  SA also
   translates AC profile into connection and service parameters in
   transport network which contains bandwidth, delay, jitter and others.
   PA drives the GMPLS signaling of control plane and receives the
   routing information.  PCE enforce SA-PCE while NRAE abstracted from
   control plane with NRAA.  In addition, TED, NRDB, MIB and
   configuration are contained in DBM.


4.  Advantage of CSO Architecture for OaaS

   CSO Architecture for OaaS is the spread of traditional three planes,
   i.e., control plane, management plane and transport plane.  The
   decisions based on CSO architecture for OaaS can be the most optimal
   and have the least cost from both application and network resource
   utilization, while the quality of user experience can reach the
   highest in this architecture.  According to various demands and
   expenses of different server providers, the operator can provide to
   them abstract topologies with NRAA so that this mechanism guarantees
   the security between operator and server provider or among server
   providers.  Since the CSO architecture for OaaS is based on new
   strategies and algorithms, the spread of current network may be just
   software promotional and the architecture is provided with the higher
   expansibility and flexibility.


5.  CSO Procedure in CSO Architecture for OaaS

   When the UA in AC receives the application request from user plane,
   it will forward this request to SSE after authenticating the user
   requests.  The certified request is analyzed via SSE and transmitted
   to ARAE for the application resource information.  SSE receives the
   network abstract information from SC via AC gateway upon request.
   ARAE responds to SSE the suited application resource abstract

   information obtained from DCNs, according to the analysis result from
   it.  Upon completing the GLB computation based on application and
   network abstract resource, and SSE chooses the most optimal server or
   VM for users, allocates application resources, and determines the
   location of the distributed application or where to migrate virtual
   machines.  According to service type, resources occupancy rate and
   QoE, UA performs accounting function and transmits the application
   requirements to SC via ASI.  UA receives the responses to NRAE and
   returns to UA.  Rating the service based on the distribution of
   resources and returning the feedback, UA provides to user stratum the
   resources at last.  When SA receives the location of the server/VM
   and the service type, it will translate this profile into connection
   and service parameters in transport network which contains bandwidth,
   delay, jitter and others after authentication and access control
   permission to this requirement.  SA also forwards the network
   resource profile to PCE at the same time.  Completing SA-PCE
   computation that factors in the connection and service parameters
   constraints, SA-PCE provides the explicit route to PA.  Then using
   the RSVP signaling protocol, PA drives control plane to establish the
   path through SCI.  After the path is setup successfully, it will
   conserve the information of the path into DBM and return overall
   results including transport network resource to AC.  After receiving
   the OSPF LSA from control plane, PA provides it to DBM for network
   resources synchronization.  AC obtains application and network
   information periodically or based on event-based trigger.  Meanwhile,
   NRAE interacts with network TE topology information base and DBM for
   abstracting network resource.  NRAE provides abstract information to
   the authorized AC using NRAA.


6.  Different Application Scenarios

6.1.  Network Resource Acquirement

   SCs receive the OSPF LSA from control plane to obtain the completely
   TE topology information network and provide it to DBM for network
   resources synchronization.  AC obtains application and network
   information periodically or based on event-based trigger.  Based on
   NRAA, SCs computes the abstract topology and feedback to AC.

6.2.  Virtual Migration Request

   Due to the insufficiency of network or servers/VMs resource, or the
   abrupt emergency to servers or network, or the requirement of saving
   energy consumption, Virtual migration request becomes significant in
   reality application.  Virtual migration migrates to the destination
   server with multi-granularities and the choice of destination one
   follows the procedure of CSO in OaaS architecture.

Internet-Draft          CSO Architecture for OaaS           October 2011


6.3.  Exception Handling

   When unexpected error happens in the process of CSO, SC will receive
   GMPLS OAM from control plane and provide the alarm information to AC
   and saves into DBM.  SC needs to route again as the service delivery
   process.


7.  Definition of New Interfaces in CSO Architecture for OaaS

   Due to additional planes in OaaS architecture, new interfaces between
   themselves, which contain ASI, UAI, and which between them and
   traditional planes in GMPLS containing SCI, SMI is to be defined in
   this section.  Nevertheless, only functional requirement will be
   demonstrated for each of above-mentioned interfaces, by which service
   of OaaS and Cross Stratum Optimization could work well.

7.1.  Functional Requirement for UAI

   UAI is the interface between user plane and application plane, which
   conveys the user's application request from user plane to application
   plane and the reply information.  Such user denotes the general users
   who apply for the application, not only includes the particular
   clients asking for video service, but also revolves the service
   provider managing the application resource such as virtual migration.
   In other words, managers of the service provider access the
   application Plane by the same interface, even if the permission will
   differ common users.

   Whatever kinds of application request is submitted, UAI should
   transmit the request information transparently, which consists of the
   user identity, request type, specified information.

7.2.  Functional Requirement for ASI

   ASI is the interface between service plane and application plane,
   which conveys the request for optical service of all application,
   containing path establishment request and network resource abstract
   request.  The latter is foundation to CSO, because the replied
   abstract information will be referred to for application plane to
   make a judgment, such as selecting a proper datacenter for a user or
   to which migrating virtual machines.  Therefore, the interface from
   SC to AC should convey the whole abstraction information, which is
   abstracted and packed by abstracting module in SC, as well as optical
   service reply.

   As to the common request for optical service, the request information
   must include the service style, such as VOD and virtual migration,

   and the source and destination node in optical layer of this service.
   The reply of which also contains the path establishment result and if
   it is failure, the reason should be given.

7.3.  Functional Requirement for SCI

   SCI is the interface between service plane and control plane.  The
   message transmitted through this interface is standard GMPLS
   including OSPF and RSVP messages, which is easily compatible to GMPLS
   control plane.

7.4.  Functional Requirement for SMI

   SMI is the interface between service plane and management plane.  The
   database of the network information maintained by SC, could supply
   some detailed network operating condition for management plane to
   make decision, and management plane also can issue OAM commands to
   SC.  Both state information and OAM message will be defined by SMI.


8.  CSO Strategies and Algorithms

   Based on functional architecture of CSO-OaaS described above, we
   propose four strategies including GLB strategy based on CSO, RB, AB
   and NB strategies.  These strategies and related algorithms are
   described in detail below.

   With RB strategy, the destination node of data center server is
   randomly selected by control plane when the application request
   comes.  With AB strategy, according to the memory, CPU and disk
   utilization, control plane chooses the server node having the minimum
   application utilization as the destination.  NB strategy selects the
   node which has the path of the minimum hop from the source to the
   destination.  With GLB strategy, as described in previous sections,
   AC selects the server node and the DC location based on the
   application status collected from data center networks and the
   network condition provided by SCs.

   We define x as the joint optimization factor to measure the balance
   between the network and application resources, which contains the
   application and network parameters.  Two application parameters,
   memory utilization and CPU usage describe the current usage of data
   center application resource, while the network parameters are
   comprised of the TE weight Wl of the current link and the hop Hp of
   the candidate path.  The overall application function is expressed as
   the sum of memory utilization and CPU usage in adjustable proportion.
   In addition, network function is expressed as the sum of TE weight
   from one to the hop of the candidate path.  So the joint optimization

   factor a is the sum of network and application function in a
   adjustable weight, which is the radio of the desired and K candidate
   server nodes or paths maximum.

   According to application utilization, AC first chooses the best K
   candidate server nodes in application stratum.  In network stratum,
   the node with minimum x value based on the joint optimization factor
   will be selected from the K candidates.  In all schemes, the path
   will be reserved and setup through signaling protocol between the
   source and destination node after the choice of the node.


9.  CSO Experiment and Demonstration

9.1.  CSO Experimental Environment

   Experimental environment is built to support the architecture of CSO
   and deployed in five servers, while each server mounts virtual
   machines created by VMware software running at servers.  Since each
   virtual machine has the operation system and its own computation
   resource, the virtual OS technology makes it easy to set up
   experiment topology based upon NSFNET with 14 control plane nodes.
   In addition, Network Management System (NMS) is placed to monitor and
   initialize the transport plane elements, while NMS is an inseparable
   management system which manages the overall network.[4]

9.2.  CSO Experimental Results

   Based on CSO functional architecture described above, GLB strategy
   based on the cross-stratum optimization is implemented and
   experimentally compared with RB, AB and NB strategies in CSO
   experimental environment.  The experimental results are shown as
   follow.  Load balance factor is defined as the disperse degree of
   application utilization in each data center server.  The higher load
   balance factor is, the worse the effect of it is.  GLB strategy leads
   to much lower load balance factor than RB and NB strategies, but
   higher than AB strategy.  In fact, AB strategy computes the node only
   considered application utilization, the path may not be able to setup
   because it does not have enough wavelength resource.  GLB has less
   network blocking probability than RB and AB strategies, while GLB
   approach has less average hop than RB and AB strategies obviously,
   for it factors the latency.  With the increase of offered load, the
   curve of GLB scheme gets closer to NB.  Global blocking probability
   measures both the network and application blocking situation measured
   by CPU and memory overflow.  Though AB approach has lower LB factor
   and similar average hop is computed through NB strategy, GLB strategy
   has significantly lower integrated blocking probability than all
   other approaches.
