This memo defines the "ipp" URL (Uniform Resource Locator) scheme.
This memo updates IPP/1.1: Encoding and Transport (RFC 2910), by
expanding and clarifying Section 5, "IPP URL Scheme", of RFC 2910.  An
"ipp" URL is used to specify the network location of a print service
that supports the IPP Protocol (RFC 2910), or of a network resource
(for example, a print job) managed by such a print service.

Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.
