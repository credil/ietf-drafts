Abstract

   This document specifies E-VPN extensions to support the new VLAN
   aware bundling service interface type defined in [EVPN-REQ]. The new
   service interface type provides advantages in reducing provisioning
   overhead as well as E-VPN instances scale in environments where a
   large number of VLANs need to be extended over an MPLS/IP network,
   while maintaining traffic segregation among those VLANs. The VLAN
   aware bundling service interface can handle the high scale
   requirements of today's Data Centers by bundling different VLANs over
   a single WAN E-VPN instance used to interconnect those Data Center
   sites.

INTERNET DRAFT          VLAN Aware EVPN Services           June 28, 2012


1  Introduction

   The high scale requirements of Layer 2 data center interconnect
   services mandate the signaling of a large number of WAN E-VPN
   instances. As such, network operators are looking for solutions
   whereby they can extend multiple Ethernet VLANs over a WAN using a
   single E-VPN instance, while maintaining traffic segregation among
   these VLANs in the data-plane. This gives rise to a requirement for a
   new service interface types: the VLAN aware bundling service
   interfaces.

   These new VLAN aware bundling service interfaces MUST: - Provide the
   ability to bundle multiple customer VLANs - Guarantee customer VLAN
   transparency end-to-end.- Maintain data-plane separation between the
   customer VLANs by creating a dedicated bridge-domain per VLAN.-
   Support customer VLAN translation to handle the scenario where
   different VLAN Identifiers (VIDs) are used on different sites to
   designate the same customer VLAN. 

   As discussed in [EVPN-REQ], two new service interface types are
   defined for VLAN aware bundling: with and without translation. The
   new service interfaces maintain data-plane separation, per VLAN,
   while sharing one L2VPN E-VPN instance. This document describes the
   use of different E-VPN routes as defined in [E-VPN] for implementing
   the VLAN-aware bundling service.

   E-VPN operation. 

   This document discusses how the Ethernet Tag field in the Ethernet
   Auto-Discovery Route, Mac Advertisement route, and inclusive
   multicast Ethernet tag route can be used to multiplex several VLANs
   over the same EVI. 

3.  Operation

   The following figure shows an example of how a VLAN aware Bundling
   service type over E-VPN could be deployed.

      |CE|-|---| 2    ====               |   |

           |             +---------------+   |               
           |                                 |               
           +---------------------------------+

   One E-VPN instance has been set up between two sites to extend
   multiple customer VLANs. On each site, multiple CE devices could be
   connected to the PE. The link between the CE and the PE could be C-
   tag or S-tag interface per [802.1Q], carrying several VLANs.Only a
   single E-VPN instance has been set up to carry customer VLANs between
   the two sites. The use of two sites in the above figure is for
   illustration; however, this could be extended to many sites. In order
   to quantify the benefit of the approach, let's assume N data center
   sites, with M customer VLANs. With the new VLAN aware service
   interface type, the solution would require one E-VPN instance,
   instead of M E-VPN instances. To maintain data-plane separation among
   the customer VLANs, each PE will create a bridge-domain per customer
   VLAN. As well, a customer VLAN on each CE port will represent a
   unique bridge port in the customer bridge-domain. Only one E-VPN
   instance would be signaled in the core and will be used to carry
   multiple customer bridge-domains (or customer VLANs) as long as those

INTERNET DRAFT          VLAN Aware EVPN Services           June 28, 2012


   customer VLANs need to be extended to the same set of sites. On the
   egress PE, the E-VPN label + the VLAN-tag would identify the
   customer-bridge domain.


3.1	Packet forwarding, MAC learning, aging and flushing

   Given the data-plane separation, packet forwarding in the scope of
   one bridge-domain will remain unchanged. When sending traffic over
   the E-VPN instance, a qualifying VLAN tag MUST be present on the
   packet. This VLAN tag has global significance across all sites
   connected to the E-VPN instance and is used to identify the customer
   bridge domain in all sites. MAC learning, aging and flushing per
   bridge-domain will remain un-changed. A mass withdraw for MAC routes
   learned over the EVPN instance can be done by withdrawing the
   Ethernet AD route with the tag ID corresponding to the bridge domain.
   

3.2	Multicast Pruning

   Efficient multicast replication in the core can be achieved via the
   use of the Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route, to prune the
   flooding on a per VLAN basis. It is possible to only replicate
   traffic to PEs that have advertised the Inclusive Multicast Ethernet
   Tag Route with the Tag value set to the VLAN value. If VLAN value is
   set to zero, then a single multicast LSM is setup to be used for all
   VLAN traffic for that E-VPN instance. Multicast snooping protocols
   such as IGMP and PIM MAY be used to further prune the replication
   scope for a given multicast group in one customer bridge-domain. 

3.3	OAM

   Customer Ethernet OAM frames (e.g. CFM [802.1ag]) will be carried
   transparently over the shared E-VPN instance by the customer's
   bridge-domains. Current MPLS OAM mechanisms need to be extended to
   verify connectivity in the E-VPN instance shared by the customer
   bridge-domains, service level OAM monitoring should be performed
   according to [RFC-6136], MPLS OAM extensions is out of scope of the
   document.

3.4	VLAN translation

   As mentioned above, the VLAN tag carried across the E-VPN instance
   for the new VLAN aware bundling E-VPN instance MUST have network wide
   significance within the scope of the E-VPN instance. As such, VLAN
   translation may be performed at each PE attached to the E-VPN
   instance to translate between the global VLAN tag identifying the
   customer bridge-domain and the local VLAN tag used by the customer

6 Appendix Vlan Aware VPLS


   It is possible to extend VPLS to support VLAN aware bundling type
   service, a new PW VLAN Vector TLV to be included the LDP PW FEC label
   mapping messages for the VPLS service, using the mechanisms specified
   in RFC 4762, as well as a new LDP capability by which a PE can
   specify its ability to support this new VLAN aware bundling service
   interface type. The new PW VLAN Vector TLV would allow multiple VLANs

   to share a single VPLS instance, while maintaining data plane
   segregation among these VLANs. This document defines extension to the
   PWE3 control protocol [RFC4447] to set up the new VLAN aware bundling
   type service in MPLS networks. An extension to the MAC Withdrawal
   mechanisms would allow per VLAN service MAC flushing for this new
   VLAN aware bundling service. 

6.1	VLAN-aware-bundling PW

   [RFC4447] uses LDP Label Mapping message [RFC5036] for advertising
   the FEC-to-PW Label binding. Two types of PW FEC, FEC-128 and FEC-
   129, can be used for this purpose. Both types of PW FEC contain a PW
   type Field.

   PW type port or raw mode will be used for the VLAN aware bundling
   interface type service.

   Use of control word is optional and frame encapsulation follows the
   same rules as in [RFC4448].

   A new PW VLAN vector TLV is defined, the new PW VLAN Vector TLV will
   be included in LDP PW label mapping messages, as well it can be
   included in the MAC flush message.

6.2	PW VLAN Vector TLV

   The PW VLAN Vector TLV is described as below:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |1|1|           VLAN Vector(TBD)|           Length              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |first VLAN Value       |NumberOfValues         |               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+               |
      |                VLANFlushBits[NumberOfValues]                  |
      |                             "                                 |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      The U and F bits are set to forward if unknown so that potential  
   intermediate VPLS PEs unaware of the new TLV can just propagate it  
   transparently.

   The MAC Flush VLAN Vector TLV type is to be assigned by IANA from   
   the LDP standard [RFC5036] "TLV type name space", as described in
   section 7.

   The TLV value field is of variable length. The first 12 bits encode

   the starting VLAN value. The second 12 bits contain the number of
   values. The VLANFlushBits is an array of bits of length =
   NumberOfValues, each bit in the array represents a VLAN flush state
   starting from the 1st VLAN value. A bit value of 1 means flush and a
   bit value of 0 means don't flush

   A Starting VLAN value of 0, SHOULD mean include all VLANs, in this
   case the NumberOfValues SHOULD be 0.

   The PW VLAN Vector TLV SHOULD be placed after the PW FEC TLV in the
   label mapping message as specified in [RFC4447], and SHOULD be placed
   after the existing TLVs in MAC Flush message as specified in
   [RFC4762].

6.3 LDP Capability Negotiation

   The capability of supporting VLAN Aware Bundling interface type
   Service MUST be advertised to all LDP peers. This is achieved by
   using the methods in [RFC5561] and advertising the LDP "VLAN aware
   Bundling Capability" TLV. If an LDP peer supports the dynamic
   capability advertisement, it can send a new Capability message with
   the S bit set for the VLAN Aware Bundling capability TLV. If the peer
   does not supports dynamic capability advertisement, then the VLAN
   aware Bundling Capability TLV MUST be included in the LDP
   Initialization message during the session establishment. An LSR
   having VLAN Aware Bundling capability MUST recognize the new PW VLAN
   Vector TLV in LDP label messages.

   In line with requirements listed in [RFC5561], the following TLV is
   defined to indicate the VLAN Aware Bundling capability:
       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |U|F| VLAN Aware Capability TBD |            Length             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |S| Reserved    |    Reserved   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Note: TLV number pending IANA allocation.
          * U-bit: SHOULD be 1 (ignore if not understood).

          * F-bit: SHOULD be 0 (don't forward if not understood).

          * VLAN Aware Bundling Capability TLV Code Point:

          The TLV type, which identifies a specific capability. The VLAN
          Aware capability code point is requested in the IANA
          allocation section below.

INTERNET DRAFT          VLAN Aware EVPN Services           June 28, 2012


          * S-bit:

          The State Bit indicates whether the sender is advertising or
          withdrawing the VLAN Aware capability. The State bit is used
          as follows:

              1 - The TLV is advertising the capability specified by the
              TLV Code Point.

              0 - The TLV is withdrawing the capability specified by the
              TLV Code Point.

          * Length: MUST be set to 2 (octet).


6.4 Multicast Pruning

   Efficient multicast replication in the core can be achieved via the
   use of the new VLAN vector TLV, to prune the flooding on a per VLAN
   basis. It is possible to only replicate traffic to PEs that have
   advertised a given VLAN in their Vector TLV. Multicast snooping
   protocols such as IGMP and PIM MAY be used to further prune the
   replication scope for a given multicast group in one customer bridge-
   domain.
