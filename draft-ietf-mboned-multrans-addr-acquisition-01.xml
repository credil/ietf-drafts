    <t> Each IPTV operator has their own arrangements for pre-provisioning
    program information including addresses of the multicast groups
    corresponding to broadcast programs on the subscriber receiver. During
    the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, scenarios can occur where the IP
    version supported by the receiver differs from that supported by the
    source.  This memo examines what has to be done to allow the receiver
    to acquire multicast address information in the version it supports in
    such scenarios.</t>

  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

    <t>Discussion of the multicast transition problem has focussed on the
    case of broadcast delivery of program content.  Within this scenario,
    the operation of viewing a program follows a well-defined sequence.
    For the sake of reducing channel switching delay, the list of
    multicast addresses is generally pre-provisioned to the receiver as
    part of the program guide.  Each operator has their own solution for
    achieving this delivery, despite the attempts at standardization
    recounted in <xref target="bkgd"/>.</t>
    
    <t>At some later time, after the program guide is delivered, the user
    chooses to view a program, possibly by selecting it from a displayed
    program listing, or simply by selecting a channel.  The receiver uses
    its pre-acquired information to signal to the network to receive the
    desired content.  In particular, the receiver initiates reception of
    multicast content using the multicast group address and possibly a
    unicast source address supplied within the program guide.</t>
    
    <t>If the network, the source of the multicast content, and the
    receivers all use IPv4, it is evident that the program information
    will only include IPv4 addresses.  Suppose now, as can occur in some
    transition scenarios, that the program guide contains only IPv4
    addresses and the receiver supports IPv6 only, or vice versa.  Then
    there will be a mismatch: the receivers will be unable to use the
    addresses that are provided in the program guide.  This memo examines
    the possible strategies for remedying this mismatch, evaluating them
    in terms of their impact on receiver implementation and network
    operation.</t>
    
    <t>Note that the simplest solution might be to avoid mismatches by
    making sure that new receivers are dual stack rather than IPv6-
    only.</t>
    
    <t>The remarks in Section 4.1 of [ID.mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps]
    are relevant to the problem considered here, but are more restricted
    in scope.</t>
    

  </section>  <!-- intro -->
  

  <section anchor="prob" title="Which Problem Are We Solving?">

    <t>In some transition scenarios, the source supports one IP version
    while the receiver and the provider network support the other (e.g.,
    the source supports IPv4, the receiver and the network to which it is
    attached support IPv6).  In this case, the problem stated above can be
    expressed as follows: how does the receiver acquire addresses of the
    IP version it supports, possibly with the help of the provider
    network?</t>
    
    <t>In other transition scenarios, the source and provider network may
    support one IP version while the receiver supports another.  In this
    case there are actually two problems: how the receiver acquires
    addresses that it supports (as already stated), and how to make those
    addresses usable in a network supporting a different version?  This
    second problem is the subject of a different memo and out of scope of
    the present one.</t>
    
    <t>There is also a third class of scenarios, where the source and
    receiver support the same IP version but the intervening network
    supports a different one (e.g., the 4-6-4 scenario, Section 3.1 of
    [ID.mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps]).  In those scenarios, delivering
    addresses of the right IP version to the receiver within the program
    guide is notionally a non-problem.  The problem still can arise, if
    the intervening network intercepts and modifies the program guide to
    be consistent with the IP version it supports.  In this case, the
    problem can be re-stated as: how can such modification be avoided when
    it is not needed?</t>

  </section>  <!-- prob -->


  <section anchor="sol" title="Possible Solutions">

    <t>This section explores three classes of solutions to the problem
    just described:
    
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>reactive: the receiver recognizes that addresses it has received
      are in the wrong version and converts them through a request to a
      mapping function or using an in-built algorithm and accompanying
      configuration;</t>
      
      <t>dynamic modification: the network intercepts the access information
      and modifies it as necessary to meet the requirements of the
      receiver;</t>
      
      <t>administrative: the electronic program guide is modified in advance
      of its acquisition by the receiver to provide alternative address
      versions.  Two variations on this strategy are identified.</t>
    </list>
    </t>
    
    <section anchor="react" title="The Reactive Strategy">

      <t>According to this strategy, a receiver recognizes that it has
      received multicast group addresses, even when they are the wrong
      version.  As one possibility, it invokes an external mapping function
      to convert them to the version it supports.  The mapping function
      could be located in another node at the user site or at a node in the
      provider network.</t>
      
      <t>This approach involves a fair amount of work to implement.  Not
      only does the receiver need to recognize that addresses are the wrong
      version; it also has to implement a new protocol to the mapping
      function.  It also has to discover that function.</t>
      
      <t>As an alternative, the receiver can implement an algorithm to
      perform the mapping itself, for example, synthesizing an IPv6 address
      given the IPv4 address of the source using the approach described by
      <xref target="ID.mboned-64-multicast-address-format"/> for multicast
      group addresses or <xref target="RFC6052"/> for unicast source
      addresses.  In this case, the receiver must be configured with the
      IPv6 prefixes allocated for that purpose in the network to which the
      receiver is attached (e.g., using 
      <xref target="ID.softwire-multicast-prefix-option"/>).
      When applicable, this approach clearly has advantages over an approach
      using an external mapping function. It still requires implementation
      effort in the receiver, but at a more limited level.</t>

    </section>  <!-- react -->
    
    <section anchor="dynam" title="Dynamic Modification">

      <t>This strategy puts the entire burden of address adaptation on the
      provider network.  It requires that an element in that network must
      intercept program guide information destined to the receiver, locate
      the access information, and map IP addresses to an alternate version
      as necessary to suit the receiver.  If the problem identified in the
      last paragraph of <xref target="prob"/> is to be avoided, the
      intercepting element has to be aware of the version supported by each
      receiver.</t>
      
      <t>As noted in the description of the OMA architecture in 
      <xref target="bkgd"/>, it is possible that such an adaptive function
      is present, but not clear that its scope would extend to IP version
      changes.  The need to include IP version along with other receiver-
      related information might or might not prove to be administratively
      demanding.  With the dynamic modification strategy the workload on the
      adaptation function might be large enough to make it a bottleneck in
      the process of program acquisition.  The mitigating factor is that
      program metadata will typically be retrieved rather less often than
      program content.</t>

      <t>This strategy has the clear advantage that it requires no changes
      in the receiver.</t>

    </section>  <!-- dynam -->
    
    <section anchor="admin" title="Administrative Preparation">

      <t>The basic idea with this strategy is that the access information in
      the program metadata is set up to provide the right address version in
      advance of acquisition by any receiver.  There are two basic
      approaches:
      
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>separate alternative versions of the access information are
        prepared.  The correct version is served up to the receiver when it
        requests it.  Like the dynamic modification strategy, this approach
        assumes that it is administratively feasible for the program guide
        server to know the IP version of the requesting receiver.  That may or
        may not be true in a given operator's context.  Also as with the
        dynamic modification approach, no change is required in the receiver. 
        The big advantage over dynamic modification is that there is no need
        for the complications of an intercepting adapting element.</t>
        
        <t>The same access information instance contains alternative IP
        address versions.  Where SDP is used, we can think of ICE or ICE-lite
        <xref target="RFC5245"/> or the proposed 'altc' mechanism 
        <xref target="ID.boucadair-altc"/>.  This requires receiver
        modification to recognize the alternative syntax and (in the case of
        ICE and potentially in the case of ICE-Lite) to take part in STUN
        exchanges. However, it means that the same access information can be
        served up to all receivers in a backward-compatible manner.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>The administrative strategy requires that the network provider have
      control over the translations used in the preparation of the
      alternative versions of the access information.  The network has to be
      aware of the translations used, so it can reuse them at other stages
      of the multicast acquisition process.  Note networks owned by
      different operators are likely to have different mappings between IPv4
      and IPv6 addresses, so if multiple receiving networks are downstream
      of the same source network, each of them may have to prepare and make
      available its own IPv6 version of the electronic program guide.</t>

<section anchor="bkgd" title="Some Background On Program Guides">

  <t>  Numerous organizations have been involved in the development of
  specifications for IPTV.  Those specifications and the requirements of
  individual providers have influenced the development of existing
  receivers.  Any solution to the multicast transition problem described
  in Section 1 has to take account of the effort involved not only in
  the direct development of a new generation of receivers, but also in
  evolving the specifications on which those receivers are based.  It is
  thus worthwhile to review the current situation as it affects
  multicast transition.</t>

  <t> The TV-Anytime forum (http://www.tv-anytime.org/) did early work
  in the area, formally terminating in 2005.  Their work focussed on the
  description of program content, to facilitate the creation of such
  descriptions and their navigation by the user.  The results are
  documented in the ETSI TS 102 822 series of technical
  specifications.</t>

  <t> The content reference identifier (CRID) is a fundamental concept
  in the TV-Anytime data model.  It refers to a specific piece of
  content or to other CRIDs, the latter thereby providing a method for
  grouping related pieces of content.  TV-Anytime registered the CRID:
  URL schema in <xref target="RFC4078"/>.  Quoting from the abstract of
  that document:
  <list style="empty">
    <t> The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) scheme "CRID:" has been devised
    to allow references to current or future scheduled publications of
    broadcast media content over television distribution platforms and the
    Internet.</t>

    <t>  The initial intended application is as an embedded link within
    scheduled programme description metadata that can be used by the home
    user or agent to associate a programme selection with the
    corresponding programme location information for subsequent automatic
    acquisition.</t>
  </list>
  </t>

  <t> The process of location resolution for the CRID: URL for an
  individual piece of content locates the content itself so that the
  user can access it.  TV-Anywhere left the details of that process

  <t> The Open IPTV Forum (http://www.oipf.tv) has focussed on defining
  the user-to-network interface, particularly for fixed broadband
  access. The architecture is based on the ETSI NGN (Next Generation
  Networks) model.  The receiver obtains the actual access information
  for a given program, including the multicast group address and
  possibly a unicast source address, from XML-encoded program
  information following the Open IPTV Forum schema.  The receiver uses
  SIP (Session Initiation Protocol <xref target="RFC3261"/>) signalling
  to obtain authorization and resources for a session, before signalling
  at the multicast level to acquire the program.  The SIP signalling
  conveys the multicast group address and the unicast source address, if
  available, in the form of an SDP (Session Description Protocol <xref
  target="RFC4566"/>) session description.</t>

  <t> Finally, the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA,
  http://www.openmobilealliance.org/) has defined a series of
  specifications relating to broadcast services over wireless networks.
  The source and multicast group addresses used to acquire a given
  program instance are provided in SDP fragments either directly
  embedded in the primary electronic program guide or pointed to by it.
  The OMA architecture provides functionality to adapt access
  information within the program guide to the requirements of the
  transport network to which the user is attached, but this
  functionality appears to be primarily directed toward overcoming
  differences in technology rather than a general capability for
  modification.</t>

  <t> In conclusion, it appears that there are at least two extant
  sources of specifications for the receiver interface, each providing
  its own data model, XML data schema, and detailed architecture.  In
  the OMA case, the access information including the source and
  multicast group addresses is embedded as an SDP fragment within a
  larger set of XML-encoded program metadata.  The OMA metadata can be
  supplied to the receiver in multiple segments, through multiple
  channels.  This complicates the task of intercepting that metadata and
  modifying it in a particular transport network.</t>
